B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Kicks A**.  But I like metal, and I love to listen to Mike Portnoy beat on the drum all day.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|Great Album.  Real Music, Real Artist. Fantastic. Definitely Real music by a real musician.  Recommended for any body who enjoys real music.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This puzzle game is the best I played so far on my kindle. You have put a lot of time in creating this game from the story to the graphics. This game remained me of Myst and Riven. Great job alway around hope to play more like this one in the future.
B00BI745AA|2.0|Too much of a let down. There are several good parts, and the singing is amazing. But overall it was lacking luster. I'd recommend just to rent this on a rainy day.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|its fun but when I stoped to go to sleep,  I tried to get back on &amp; now it wants me to pay. I was still at the beginning which is why I don't understand.
B00BESM14U|1.0|This was way too boring. And that was a let down since the book is really good! Probably be best for young teens
B00CDT41RY|5.0|We started watching this at 11pm thinking we will watch the beginning and finish it the following day.  It was so engaging that we didn't want to go to bed!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The PERFECT family movie, even for adults of all ages! All of the graphics were amazing, and it was hilarious to see some of the most famous videogame characters on there! This is a definite buy--Disney always produces spectacular movies
B005LAIIFS|5.0|The whole family enjoyed it. I couldn't wait to watch it again with my grandson. Eggs are adorable, great for basket
B00BSBXA98|5.0|This is Just as great as seeing it live! HIGHLY recommend renting/buying this. Even the men in the house enjoyed it!
B009193OCM|5.0|So easy to use, and it gives a great view of New York City. We now know where to go and what to see, and I am sure it will help us find our way around.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful puzzle game. No hidden object. Just pure puzzle and logic. Top notch graphics for a tablet app. Puzzles were challenging and fair. Engaging story as well. Worth the money and time. I hope to see the next part soon.
B007712XAU|5.0|Way beyond what I was expecting.  This was excellent.  Once I started watching it I was addicted to it.  I ordered season 3 and can't wait till season 4 comes out.  The music is compelling and draws you emotionally in with the story line.  At the end of season 3 I was crying like I knew the family.  For 2 days I was emotionally sick.  I don't ever remember a film touching me this way.
1476734941|5.0|Wow!  I have litterly tried every diet out there and this one is for real.  Most importantly, I think it works because it is not really a diet, but a healthier way to eat and live longer.  The keys to our (husband & myself) losing weight: 1) follow 500 cal fast 2 days a week, 2) eat healthier & smaller portions on remaining 5 days, 3) eliminate or minimize any junk food in the house or fast food for lunch and 4) walk briskly at least 5 nights/ week for 45-60 mins.<br />Starting this diet, I only had about 15lbs to lose, so to see results this fast and this consistent is unbelievable.  We plan to make this regime not a diet, but a permanent lifestyle.  A way of living healthier & longer at a safe weight.  My husband wants to lose about 25lbs and has lost 6lbs in the 3 weeks.<br />I cant express my excitement and complete belief in this program.  I first watched the program on tv and liked the reasoning & process of how Mr. Mosely arrived at this solution.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Can identify with the characters.  It was a true romance.  Loved it......watched it 4 times.  The cast they choose for this film was perfect.  The chemistry was excellent.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This blu-ray set is a great addition to my movie collection. The picture quality is so much nicer in hi-def.
0061950726|5.0|Kline's writing was clear with well-developed characters which pulled at my heartstrings!  The book gave an honest and historical glance at the orphan trains.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this cd for my daughter.  I enjoy the music too.  It's good/clean music.  She was thrilled to get it.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite shows on Tv right now. It is well written, has comedy, crime, passion and family.  LOVE THIS SHOW!! Well worth the money to own all the seasons!!
B007XHWROK|5.0|if you love Justin Bieber you will love the cd.  Good/clean music.  My 6 year old son loves it too.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Fun, light hearted romp through time with entertaining characters and plot line that leaves you eagerly looking forward to the next twist and turn.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Even after the departure of Jac and Zach Farro, Paramore was able to recreate some sounds of their past and experiment with some new ones. You'll get through the first 12 tracks in a breeze but the remaining 5 tracks didn't really stick well-- even after trying to listen to them multiple times. Nevertheless, the first 12 tracks are pretty much an entire album and deserve 5 stars for creativity and giving older fans what they want.
0399224459|4.0|You can make it as  long or short as you need, by simply reading it through to be short, or by having your child describe the action in the story to make it longer.  Its fun and interesting, without being too stimulating for them to want to fall asleep.
B0000048CX|5.0|My son had this CD and I got to hear it and I really love it!  It is just great music to listen to!  Guitar playing is enjoyable and the whole thing is just very pleasing to my 60 year old ears and heart!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Even after watching this movie no less than a billion times over my lifetime, I still love it!  If you like Tim Burton, this is his early stuff, and it's great =)
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Was a gift, but the recipient loves the program.  He loved it.  I've purchased all seasons on video for him to date.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love it!!  We cannot wait for Season 3!!  They did a great job & even without nudity!! Yeh!!  Keep it up!!
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|Excellent videos for Rammstein fans! The behind the scenes, interviews and making of videos are great! We love this band!
B000BKHL1K|5.0|This thing is so awesome. The look of it hanging on my wall is fantastic. Super easy to I stall and all you need is a brain to I stall this. If a man can't figure out how to install this then he needs to look in the mirror. Supplied hardware is fine when installed straight on drywall. Holds to wall with three screws mounting points. Wine bottles are held on at a slight angle and looks cool.
B005GSVFF0|4.0|We love the movie! The 3D effects are great! The only reason I chose 4 stars instead of 5 is because the disc had a slight delay in one of the scenes.
B008NIS2SS|5.0|7 classic albums for such a great price is just mind boggling. The sound quality is pretty dang good too (especially considering when some of these recordings were done). If you don't have Bill Evans in your jazz collection, he is a must!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Once I started reading this book, it was hard to put it down. I love the story, cannot wait for more! Only a few minor typos, which is to be expected in any book (no one is perfect, you can't catch them all). Very good, I have yet to read one from Sanderson that I did NOT like!
B00B2166BS|3.0|Slower to charge my nexus than I thought it would be, seems to<br />take all night to charge the tablet
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome and now with it on the kindle I can play it on the GO! it is so cool I love this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is true the best game ever(: I am so happy every time j play it I recommend it fir everyone(:!!!
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|Beach House's Myth played on my Slacker station and it caught my attention.  The entire Bloom album is just incredible.  I gave their previous effort Teen Dream a try as well, but did not find it nearly as interesting or cohesive as this one.  Looking forward to hearing what they come up with next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what it claims in an easy to see format. Since my Kindle opens as quickly as a calculator, it is practical too.
1926778537|5.0|Played the game and really enjoyed going through the development process, seeing the designs being conveyed into the final game. Great for my collection!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Well-written tale of a young woman's journey, based on a several hundred mile hike up the Pacific Coast Trail the author took in her twenties. It's a page-turner about a lost young woman trying to find herself, written 20 years after her trip. I recommend the book, but with some minor caveats.<br /><br />Occasionally I wondered if the author had embroidered some events or simply remembered them more dramatically as an older person.After being forced to shoot a favorite horse, the protagonist dreamt that the horse brought her a bouquet of flowers, which didn't ring true to me. A few other events seemed that way too - however, the book captures the frailty of youth and reminded me of my own early stumblings, errors and misadventures that finally brought me to a full and happy life.<br /><br />Much of this book is eloquently written and emotionally appealing. The author created a page-turner by leaving you hanging at the end of most chapters, wondering what could possibly happen next? In some ways, it reminded me of Cormac McCarthy's The Road in that it is the tale of a trip and a life, an often-told and classic approach to literature which McCarthy does better, but this author does very well.<br /><br />I read this book for book club and felt that the members who had grown up in reasonably healthy, two-parent families who loved and tended to their children adequately were more critical of the book and the author than those members who had had some difficulties in their family lives. Children of alcoholic, drug-addicted, broken, abusive or otherwise ill-prepared parents understood the book in a whole different context.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone who has taken a trip that opened their lives to new adventure, whether internal or external. However, I'm not sure everyone in my book group would agree!
1452111014|5.0|Love the book for its clear explanation for the development process, lovely artworks and even the art that eventually did not make the cut; definitely recommended for fans of the film!
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Had to listen to it a few times before we really got into it... Now we love it as with all of Rock and the brown trucker band's music
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Gameplay is challenging enough to not be boring. Story was interesting but vague at the end. But there us going to be a part 2. Pretty smooth gameplay.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I'm still reading this novel and dread the day when it will end.  Never a dull moment.  I searched the web for interviews with the author and found quite a few so if you have an interest in this book and would like to get a feel for Gregory Roberts' background, you will benefit from listening to these interviews as he describes the book in quite a bit of detail.  He is an amazing novelist.  The novel is based on facts from his own past and he fictionalizes the characters to some degree.  You will not be disappointed.
B004I744AS|5.0|Got this for the dictionary kept it for the fun! I use it daily just for the vocab challenges and hangman.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Quit trying to act sophisticated this movie is dumb. just wasted 10 bucks. It's in black and white. Boooorrriiiinng........ I highly suggest not buying. Let's watch a hour and a half black and white monologue... Yay!
B0083Z614S|3.0|They were being mean to the girl in her home country...didn't appreciate that.  I would have liked a little more tolerance.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I wish this was the cable that came with my Kindle originally. When paired with the Amazon Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charging. It charges so much faster.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I play tons of these HO games, cheesy plots aside, and can truly appreciate when one is quality. This isn't a bad game, I've played others that are better, and I've played one's that are way worse. It could have been longer, when I spend 4.99 I expect more out of the game. The graphics were actually nice, no lost quality when zoomed in, something that is a big factor to any HO fan. I don't play for the plot, the characters, I play for the HO and the point and click. There was a ton of point and click, not so much the HO. All in all, not bad but I'm not going to keep it on my kindle.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This has been a fun time waster for me.  Now if I could just visit neighbors I'd be happy.  I need hearts.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great dino theme park game. Build up both parks and let you imagination work for you.  Keeps my son looking forward to the next step.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I've never read the Harry Potter series but was very interested in reading this book as I knew it would be something different.  It started off a little slow for me but once I read further and uncovered more about the different characters and families I was hooked.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything -- his house, his job, and his wife. He now finds himself living back with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert DeNiro) after spending eight months is a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life.  All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet-and to  share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook walks the fine line with a romantic comedy that details mental illness but for the most part does it right without going overboard.  The movie starts a little slow but providing an interesting enough romantic comedy story with a strong performance from Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Cooper.  This movie provides a comedy that keeps the comedy clean without being offensive or over the line.<br /><br />Worth a watch or purchase.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|amazing actors a must watch for people interested in the supernatural. Great entertainment! I am totally addicted. worth every penny
B00B2274W2|5.0|The added parts are so worth it, They feel very natural and flow well with the original. So glad they added them back in and gave us a chance to see it all put together.
B00AFARIZA|5.0|Not only is Toscanini still great but the sound on these CDs is much improved over what use to be heard.  The performances sound somewhat different from what the NBC Symphony did with these works but I feel that everybody should own everything available by Toscanini.  I guess I am slightly prejudiced in his favor.  Anyway, I highly recommend this set.
1936891026|5.0|Should be required reading for anyone involved in any creative pursuit, especially writers.  The best book of it's kind I have ever read.
142314189X|5.0|First of all I've always loved reading greek mithology, so that's the main reason of why I bought these books. In my opinion Rick Riordan is great mixing up the ancient greek mithology, with the contemporary times we've lived in<br /><br />Now, how about this specific collection? It's amazing, the colors look increible (the hardcovers have such a bright quality); the size of the font is great for reading without making you force your sight; and the box -the books came in- it's so nice and elegant for having your collection packed
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|This movie reminds me of Dick Tracey with Warren Beauty and Madonna. It feels like a grown up version of that movie. The story lets the viewer in on a little secret from LA's past. Emma Stone does her best Jessica Rabbit impression. In one scene, she is walking toward the bar and does the Jessica Rabbit walk to Ryan Gosling. The story wasn't bad, the characters were interesting and it was visually stunning.
B0002VFXFE|3.0|it's kinda expensive? it's just my opinion<br />i think it's just find small stuff, less mount of money g g g g
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie really was heartwarming. This dysfunctional family never gave up on a son who had really tested them. The father continued to believe in his son and hang in there when most would have thrown in the towel. Jennifer Lawrence's character was living behind her family's home and bringing in strangers. It is a quirky love story but it is also about family really not giving up on each other.
B005EHILV4|5.0|great for anyone honestly its a good piece of equipment i suggest this to any starting artist i love it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|great game fun recodwmmend highly<br />good combo of bingo and slots<br />addictive<br />makes you want to buy credits<br />sometimes freezes but not often
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|The best fighter simulation yet. A must have for fighter junkies. Can't wait to fly the F-22 &amp; the F-35'
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|The people who give this movie a single star are the ones that only knew it had a couple of big stars in it and likely only enjoy big budget, simple to understand films. If you can't calm yourself down enough to allow another person's perspective on life wash over you, don't bother with this film. If you have ever gone out of your way to see the sun set, then this movie may be for you. Watch Malick's other films first as it may help you enjoy this one more.
B0080K3J7S|5.0|A stunning combination of a thriller, start ups owner manual, cryptography tutorial, and philosophical musings. The 1000 pages finished too soon.
B000UUF69A|4.0|Good movie, my kids and I enjoyed it. The storyline and voice acting is good. It also looks great in HD.
B008XGW1CI|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is an excellent book--well-written, featuring a host of masterfully developed characters and skillfully interwoven strands of plot.  It's also depressing as hell!  Few of the characters are likable--at first.  Yet one wants to keep reading.  As the strands continue to intersect and the characters from these strands interact, the story becomes increasingly engrossing--and almost every detail mentioned once ultimately plays a part in the outcome.  By the end, the reader is sympathizing with quite a few characters, happy for a few and even grieving for some.  All this, because a member of the parish council in an idyllic English village was too busy to see a doctor about his headaches!
0316172324|5.0|Malcom Gladwell is an author that makes you think outside of the box and with Blink, it's no exception.  This book focuses on split-second thinking and reasoning and really helps you understand why you make the decisions you do (consciously or sub-consciously).  He is a really good author and this book is worth your time.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Kids thought it was OK - but I noticed they didn't request to watch it again and again like so many of the other movies they watch.
1611761182|5.0|Another K. Follet masterpiece.<br />Every page action packed.<br />Truely a pleasurable read.<br />Will wait with anticipation for<br />the completion of the Trilogy!
B000BISBDY|5.0|Haven't given it to him yet, but this is for my father who raised his kiids learning Johnny Cash.  He will love it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It honestly could've been better. I don't have the nagging feeling like my life just ended because the book ended but I surprisingly learned some life lessons from it.
1609611543|4.0|I bought this book solely for the hope that it could help me lose weight.  I have only recently gone off a medical treatment that typically results in a weight gain of up to 20 percent.  And that is about what I gained, on top of being too heavy to start.  My excess is primarily around my middle.  I almost immediately lost 12 pounds but have plateaued for a couple of weeks.  I started going NO WHEAT before reading all of the book.  I'd stopped reading just short of it telling of the withdrawal symptoms.  Unfortunately I experienced most of them and was mystified as to why until I read the remainder of the book.  About that time the withdrawal symptoms began to subside and, of course, then I knew why.  It's best to read all of the directions, not just half of them.  But I recommend the book for everyone.  It is very informative for anyone.  I was especially surprised to learn that the glycemic index of bread is higher than table sugar.  I think the book would be of considerable value to type 2 diabetics and pre-diabetics also.<br /><br />Follow-up 07-28-2013<br />I had to give up on my attempt to lose weight because of serious hypoglycemic result.  After a second try and loss of an additional 6 pounds the same happened again.  Now I've purchased the cook book in hopes that I can give it a 3rd try avoiding the earlier problem.  Upon my return to wheat products I had some of the typical return symptoms - - - that I'd never experienced before going off wheat products.  I AM CONVINCED that wheat products are bad news.  dch
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love hidden object games and this one was no exception. I can't wait for the sequel to come out!!!!!!!!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The main characters spend a lot of time in the Northwest territories in rugged and wild surroundings.  I could have done with fewer lectures about mining.  It got to be a bit pedantic.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|if you like action this a good game for you because iron man shoots lasers machine guns and all kinds of cool weapons you can use. this is the best game I have on my kindle
B002VECM72|5.0|a feel good story, must see for the whole family. am happy with the purchase and the quality of the blu ray
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I'm not one for navel-gazing exercises such as Tree of Life and Anti-Christ but The Master caught me up, perhaps despite myself, right from the start, perhaps because it really has some dramatic teeth to it (I felt  the same way about the Thin Red Line, whose core was grounded in real-life experiences of men). Of course the acting was brilliant, which goes without saying, and the obvious reflections upon the life of L. Ron Hubbard (minus the true craziness of Hubbard which probably couldn't be captured in any film) make this a curious exercise in human reflection. At some point the film was painful to watch, the sense of suffering, betrayal, and mental illness was sorrowful, but these moments were lightened by an astonishing sense of time and place, as when The Master gives his speech before an audience of listeners. I felt I was right there in the '50s. Beautiful insight and original film-making. A+
1592537251|5.0|Love to watch the works and tips from great sketchers.  Veryyyyy interesting!  Just can't stop watching and reading everything about their work.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love  the history and i love that he's woven the old characters into the book! Can't wait for the third book!
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I was very disappointed in the quality of pictures from my 35 mm negatives.  I, also, had difficulty with the negatives getting caught in the machine and had to jiggle the negatives while rewinding them to get them through.  The worst, though, was that almost all of my pictures had specs on them because the negative holder collected dust particles and I could not keep it clean.  Maybe there is a trick to keeping it clean, but I don't know it.  Also, the plastic holder was scratched after only about one 100 negatives went through.  If I am doing something wrong, I would love some help before I have to return this item.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun and the best game ever. I play this game 24/7 everyday when I come home from school.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|this was a surprise gift to me from my wife, since I am a total geek great bluray collection to have
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Extremely well written, and immensely detailed! Loved it, and was devastated it was over!!!! Cannot wait for her next piece of literature!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|The only issue I have is the game does not have a selection of music to choose from.<br />LOVE THE GAME THOUGH.<br /><br />Tanya

B00004YRQA|4.0|This memory Card works for me, I like it. I can put alot of games on it. Might but more later
0812993845|4.0|Lottie knew it was going to happen.  Her boyfriend of two years was going to propose over lunch and they were going to live happily ever after...except he didn't.  Enter Ben, an old flame who does propose to her and Lottie jumps at the chance.  This leads to her older sister Fliss doing everything in her power to stop her impulsive younger sister from doing one of her classic breakup poor choices.  What follows is a frolicking comedy detailing what might be the worst wedding night ever.<br /><br />Filled with laughs, Wedding Night is a classic Kinsella novel.  If you've liked Sophie Kinsella books in the past, this is another fun loving novel that is a cute/quick read.  Lottie and Fliss are great main characters and you will fall in love with both women by the end of the book.  Sure the situations are a bit ridiculous, but that's half the fun!  It's a great escape from real life and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at the crazy situations the two sisters constantly find themselves in.
0393330435|2.0|He almost doesn't talks about apple, its a autobiography, but I got bored.<br />i dont recommend this book almost you are really interested in wozniak
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|All I could say is \\" James Bond 007\\". The action pack scene. The colors and the scenery .  The mystery and the excitement. The sadness in the lost of a great mentor .
B003DT19F0|5.0|We had the book before the DVD and my daughter really liked the story so getting the DVD was a bonus for her and the DVD storyline goes into much more detail on Lizzie' friendship with Tinkerbell which all little girls who love fairies or the idea of them will identify with befriending an actual fairy and learning about them.  It's very cute with a happy ending. Appropriate for very young children. No violence or dark imagery the only &#34;villian&#34; is Mr Twitches the house cat and he is easily tamed by the other fairies. I would recommend for parents looking for gentle content viewing for their wee ones.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie was so superb and brilliantly acted. I was glue to my couch and watching every moment if the movie. I am so happy to have seen it. I applaud the actors, director , producer and all the crew members that made this movie.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It is hard to find words but it helps sometimes I know it says not helpful it is. I do recommend this book
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Only thing that would make it better is to enable a gameplay that's not always flying defending off bigger bosses.
B00C7JCDO8|3.0|I love Whitesnake, or anything David Coverdale, but this live album, Dvd, is them going through the motions, playing the hits as it were, is just something that seems to me is meant to tide us over until the next Whitesnake album. If you're a die hard like I am, get both the DVD and album/cd, if not, wait until the next album and see where that one takes us. The last thing I ever want to see is, Whitesnake, or David Coverdale become a parody of himself. He still has the voice from Hell and lets not forget to mention, Doug Aldrich on guitar. Pick up on the new Burning Rain when it comes out. It will be a good album to pass the time with until Whitesnake come back and give us another opus.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|i dont want to write a review. if you like this movie. then get it. if you dont like it you wont like this.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Honestly I was hooked when I finished the pilot. Great actors and plot. Almost like a Buffy meets Grimm kind of show.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charger should be standard issue with every Nexus 10. I was leery of buying non-OEM charging accessories for my beloved Nexus, but this charger works beautifully. The pogo pins magnetically snap in to the charging dock. They take a little finesse to get used to but there is a gratifying 'click' when they hit home. Charging is fast too, noticeably faster than the micro-usb connection. Buy it!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Easy to use and you can learn simple songs easily using this ap. I recommend this ap to anyone who wants to play around with basic<br />Beginner songs.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun to play but my Kindle keeps freezing while playing.  Rating would be higher if it did not do this
4898153194|5.0|The photographs are simply beautiful and charming. They deserve to be printed at double or triple size.<br />The delivery from Japan was very quick and had a personal touch -- also very charming!
1572816112|5.0|This is a really beautiful tarot card set.  Some people have complained that their size makes them difficult to shuffle, but I just slightly modified my shuffling technique and have had no trouble getting them shuffled easily.  Everyone that I have read for have commented on the beautiful artwork on these cards.  They are made on high quality card stock and the colors are vivid.  I am so happy with this deck and will use them for many many years to come! I would recommend these to anyone.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this series. I have read all five books by Martin, and the series is quite faithful to the books.  The acting, costumes and sets are wonderful.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the book. It was much better than the movie. It had all of the things I like in a book.
B000I9U75G|2.0|My real rating is 2.5.  the thing just didn't work.  I really felt bad for all the actors in it.  Most of them are world class in my book, but what can you do?  If someone pays you to act like a mook, you're going to look like a mook...<br /><br />If the movie had only been worse, then maybe it would've come off as a campy B movie, or even a bit of a spoof.  Sadly, it didn't.
B009R659L8|5.0|Book was a good thriller.  I like most of Mary Higgins Clark's books.  This was very suspenseful.  Would recommend to anyone.
0385349831|2.0|I love Paulo Coelho's story telling, simple, profound, universal.  So I was really looking forward to his latest offering.  It turned out to be a contrived setting for him to lay out his personal philosophy in the speech of a wise man the night before the sacking of Jerusalem.  everyone knew they would be dead in the morning, so the wise man, the Copt, answers all their questions--at great length--about the purpose of life and urges them to go home and write everything they recall of his wise answers before they die. It's sort of a latter day version of Gibran's, The Prophet, only much longer.  I have little time for poorly disguised pulpits.  I'd rather he'd have written his philosophy as a memoir.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great price for this but my only complaint is amazon seriously needs to fix the quality and rendering setting for there video player they provide. Videos will not always load in HD quality and i have the connection speed. 50mbps to be honest and i get 420p quality at times.

B00CLR127A|5.0|This album continues the classic melodic love music of my favorite band HIM. They have not changed their style and that's why they have continued to make album after album of music gold. I have been a fan of them since Razorblade Romance and they continue to keep their dark side in Tears on Tape.

There is nothing that I have ever used that can beat it's simplicity of installation and usage.  It links all of your devices together so that you can control them from your phone, I-pad, Kindle or whatever you like to travel with.  You just click on the computer you need to look at and up it comes.  You can do anything that you would do if you were home in front of your PC or laptop.  No network needed, just &#34;Jump&#34;.

Not too hot to me...<br /><br />Update: Read review from 'DS from LA'  Totally true and hilarious
B00B2166BS|5.0|If you are reading this it means you're not sure if the cord is a good idea.  I got mine because I was afraid that sooner rather than later I would bump my nexus while it was charging with the micro usb and damage it.  Now I don't have to worry.  I have had the cord for well over two months now and no problems.  My only complaint is that I had to wait to buy the cord, this cord should COME with the nexus 10 (it's that good).  Now click buy, you're welcome and the end.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|So Tony Stark, him what's a \\"genius billionaire playboy philanthropist,\\" is of late going thru a crap time. His stint with the Avengers, his part in stopping the Chitauri invasion, has opened his eyes to the immensity of the universe and his tiny dot of a place in it. Today Tony suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and the wiggy moments and the chronic insomnia that go with that. \\"I'm a pipin' hot mess,\\" he confesses. Mostly he wants to protect the things he cherishes most, and topping that list is Pepper Potts, the one person he \\"cannot live without.\\" And so you may scratch your head and ponder why Tony would so impulsively publicly challenge the fearsome global terrorist, him what styles himself the Mandarin and is ethnically ambiguous and dresses like a Chinese warlord. Tony, in that brash moment, gives out his Malibu home address on national tv. That moment bites him in the butt.<br /><br />But wait... As Tony, who provides voice-over narration, tells it, this mess originates thirteen years ago. The film opens on New Year's Eve in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, during a technological summit. Tony Stark, back then more warmonger than philanthropist, was busy applying his brand of seduction on hottie botanist - but she's more than a botanist - Dr. Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Callous and randy, he dismisses the overtures made by the unkempt, geeky scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). Tony literally leaves him out in the cold.<br /><br />Present-day now, and Killian has resurfaced as this sleek, confident entrepreneur, and his big brain is big and brainy enough that it dazzles the normally unimpressed Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, Tony, consumed by his anxiety attacks, has neglected his personal relationships in favor of heavy time in the lab (and if you'd seen the trailers, then you know what he'd been tinkering with down there).<br /><br />The Mandarin's reach spans limitless, seems like. His retaliation to Tony's challenge is rapid and ruthless and comprehensive. The destruction of Tony's world propels him on a quest to root out all those responsible. And maybe that's the smartest move that writer/director Shane Black contributes. Months ago, Black had vowed that, for this movie, he wouldn't pit men in armor against each other, and he holds to that. In fact, the pendulum swings so much the other way that, if anything, there may be a dearth of Iron Man sequences. Instead, Black opts to showcase Tony Stark predominantly outside of his metal shell. When you strip away the CG and the big superhero elements, this movie essentially boils down to a detective story. And it's never ever a dummy move to shoot more of Robert Downey, Jr. in front of the camera. And because this is Downey, Jr. and because this is Tony Stark, Tony's recent emotional damage never quite undercuts the swagger. Downey's comic timing is impeccable, the quicksilver wit flashes plenty, but without compromising the dramatic beats. Downey is so good. Shane Black, who directed him in the awesome KISS KISS BANG BANG, takes full advantage of his star's talents. This is, of course, providing that you're down with - or if you buy into - Stark's having accrued debilitating trauma as a direct result of what he experienced in THE AVENGERS. Some may contend that Tony Stark is so arrogant there's no room in his psyche for a bump of insecurity.<br /><br />IRON MAN 3 is killing it at the box office because folks view it as a direct AVENGERS sequel and because of (mostly) positive word-of-mouth. Much to like about IRON MAN 3, but also a grip of select quibbles.<br /><br />The positives (don't worry, no spoilers):<br /><br />- If you like Shane Black and his slick, high octane formula and his sense of humor, then prepare to get giddy<br />- The screenplay is sharp and emotionally charged and puts Stark thru his paces<br />- More of Downey, Jr. on camera, oozing charisma and demonstrating yet again that Stark is much more than a guy in an iron suit<br />- Expands the roles ofPepper, Rhodey, and even Happy<br />- It presents a startling take on one of Iron Man's classic adversaries. Ben Kingsley threatens to steal scenes from Downey<br />- Neat focus on the Mark 42 armor, on its strengths and weaknesses<br />- Somewhere along the way, Tony finds himself in Tennessee and runs into a kid sidekick (Disney's mandate?) and exhibits wonderful chemistry with him<br />- Ample references made to the Avengers movie (my favorite is probably Happy's comment about Tony's being too busy hanging out with his Superfriends)<br />- Humor, plenty of it<br />- \\"Trevor Slattery,\\" brilliant<br />- The post-credit scene<br />- Cool armor mayhem<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />- A few dead spots (usually when Downey's not onscreen)<br />- Diehard comic book fans may get upset over the treatment of the Mandarin<br />- Not a faithful adaptation of the fan favorite Warren Ellis \\"Extremis\\" arc (again depends on how much of a diehard comic book fan you are)<br />- Pretty tired of the often regurgitated super-soldier formula plotline<br />- Was the Ten Rings, a seed planted in the first IRON MAN, even mentioned in IRON MAN 3? (Maybe I missed it)<br />- Rebecca Hall's part is underdeveloped<br />- Late in the film, a cop out of what would've been a hell of a dramatic development<br />- Obstinately sidesteps explaining why none of Tony's Superfriends come to help out<br />- In the interest of having the cake and blah blah blah... not enough Iron Man<br />- May be Downey's swan song (if it is, it's a good way to bow out)Pepper, Rhodey, and even Happy<br />- It presents a startling take on one of Iron Man's classic adversaries.

B004SBS8LA|3.0|I don't like this game that much.The original is better in my opinion. I'm 50/50 on if I would recommend it or not.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Great story line. Awesome backgrounds with decent sound effects. Keeps me interested and looking for what comes next. Pretty decent music too.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love it! I am on great white right now and am trying to get a megalodon. I recommend this game.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|It has no redeeming qualities. Don't even bother. Even Johnny Depp can't save this one.Why did they even bother to make this. Did it make any money?
B00A4VGUIG|1.0|Terrible it will not let me do anything on the third day. Hate it I am going to delete it now.

B0045XGRQE|5.0|Tons of fun. Robert Downy Jr. is in top form and a joy to watch. Looking forward to Iron Man 3
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Does all it claims but a bit better. I paid $40 for a sleep sound device, alarm clock combo. I liked it though the sounds were limited but it died after about a year. So, how can you lose for 99 cents? Very realistic sounds and lots of them. Go visit a friend who has no pets, put on the cat purr sound, slip it out of sight and ask about his cat! Seriously, if you like some type of constant sound foe sleeping, grab this and try it before paying for the fancy machine. I didn't count but there are a lot of sounds included
B0083H6AQA|3.0|Why making a Guy de Maupassant adaptation now? That's what I was thinking before watching \\"Bel Ami,\\" a 2012 film starring Robert Pattinson as Georges Duroy, a social climber in the 19gh century France rising to power by seducing wealthy women. But I like Christina Ricci, so anyway I gave it a try. She was very good (when she wasn't?), but the film itself, beautifully shot as it is, still doesn't answer the question: Why \\"Bel Ami\\"?<br /><br />Robert Pattinson plays Georges Duroy, a man of modest means and limited talent, who first succeeds as a columnist, with a help from his old friend Charles Forestier (Philip Glenister) and Charles's wife Madeleine (Uma Thurman). Then he meets two of her friends, fun-loving Clotilde de Marelle (Christina Ricci) and Madame Rousset (Kristin Scott Thomas).<br /><br />All these Paris women, beautiful and elegant, seem to find Georges very attractive, sexually or otherwise. This is where the film falters. Robert Pattinson does his best, but with his character too flat and story too thin, he is not very convincing as a devilish charmer. To make matters worse, the story often feels rushed, jumping from one episode to another, and leaving little space for characters to develop.<br /><br />Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod gathered an impressive cast, and \\"Bel Ami\\" has some excellent costume design. Still, we are not allowed to be well acquainted with the characters, and as a social satire the film is weak. Watching this \\"Bel Ami\\" is like reading a synopsis of the Guy de Maupassant novel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. I was doing this book for a school project. I had heard it was  a good book but I underestimated it. Great read!
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I watched this, hoping for some big payoff in the end that would put meaning to the 3 hrs of my life I invested in this big name pile of dung but alas that didn't happen. The end was as meaningless as the beginning and pretty much anything in between. If I were asked what the movie was about I could not give a synopsis. It was basically several timelines that didn't seem to have anything to do with each other broken up by short and senseless acts of extreme violence that didn't seem to have anything to do with the story either.<br /><br />It's boring, its long, its senseless and you'll forget it the minute its over...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is mind blowing i have not found any bugs i just hate the ads though<br />it even has a different theme every once and a while
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Nice game, which is harder than it looks to succeed at.<br /><br />I found the initial instructions to be a little confusing, but once I played a few games and saw what the computers were doing, and how the scoring really worked, it was fine.
B001DSNEJM|5.0|The movie is a little sad but still an excellent movie.  I love all of Paul Walker movies.  I would recommend this to all Paul Walker fans.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely outstanding. From the minute you enter the room you are hooked. I have done nearly everything myst has done and this is right there with it. Be ready for some very short nights!
B004X8W4A4|4.0|The book is like a long episode of &#34;Castle&#34; with all the twists and turns. The tagalong here is Jameson Rook who helps out in the cases because of his knowledge obtained as a journalist. Nikki is a kick-butt detective. The descriptions of the scenes are so vivid you feel like you're right there.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game. It is fun and very addictive.  Also it is very cute and my kids love the colors.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|This album has her best songs since she won American Idol. If you feel like you need music to lift you up while you're cleaning the house, this album has it. If you need background music for a romantic dinner, this is your album. It has a great variety of great music.

B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Tom Cruise playing a 6'5\\" - 250lb. giant is ridiculous, after reading and enjoying all the books, this movie was miss casted. If you enjoyed the movie do not read the books as you will not be able to see Cruise as Reacher. Cruise over acts the part trying to make up for his size. Reacher is a quiet man that realizes his size intimidates people.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I've been a fan of Michael since his earliest days as a total unknown, so I'm not taking this review lightly. Most of my thoughts have already been covered by other reviewers, so I'm not going to rate each song. My basic problem is that this CD is all over the map with song selections and arrangements, with the result that he no longer has a discernible singing style.  As an example, I think Come Dance With Me makes a lousy cha cha, and hearing it again on DWTS didn't change my mind.  I first heard Michael on a Philadelphia jazz station, and tend to favor his big band arrangements of standards. I find that many of the arrangements on this disk are noisy and overblown, with pounding drums and piano. This huge orchestra is no better than his tour band. This CD adds nothing to his legacy...it's basically a wast of time and creative energy.<br /><br />The four guest artists add nothing. I can't imagine who would select Something Stupid with Reese Witherspoon as a worthy track. Michael could have sung Bryan Adams part and no one would have known the difference. The Puppini Sisters and Naturally 7 are completely lost in the deep background. Also, I think Michael has to do some soul searching on his song writing process.  I applaud his desire to seriously branch into writing and arranging, but his songs are written with as many as four other collaborators, with the result that there is no &#34;Buble&#34; signature song style. He needs a BIG, melodious hit that will put him on the map with other famous songwriters.<br /><br />I suggest you listen to the tracks and download those you like. No need to buy the CD.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|I listened to this for the first time and thought \\"wow\\"... I'm up to somewhere around 500, and still think \\"wow\\"... I think this is an excellent album.  Great melodies, creative hooks without getting corny, and a little sloppy where it needs to be.  Buy this.
0812993845|2.0|I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's previous novels.  This one was just way over the top and too ridiculous to enjoy.  Combine that with characters I didn't like and the length of the book, I can barely give 2 stars.  I hope her next one is better.
B005HSL626|1.0|I liked the game for about 2 days, now all it does is freeze up and kicks me out of the game. Not worth the download
B0074MZSWW|3.0|On first listening there's only one good song on this album, the rest either gave no strong impression or were unimpressive on first listen. It often happens that albums can grow on you, I'll try to give it a few more listens.
0345525558|4.0|I had no idea that flowers had name.  I only wish my I could remember their meanings.  The club felt it wasn't that good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The beginning was slow but after that I had to continue I couldn't help but read the rest. I need more,what will happen next?
0385344228|2.0|I heard a lot about this book last year and it got a lot of great ratings. I don't typically like mysteries so I was skeptical until I finally added it to my TBR and there it stayed until I read it this year.  I am trying to read more outside my usual genres so decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't see the appeal.  I approached the book with an open mind and really wanted to like it, but I just didn't.  I also knew there was a twist at the end and that was the main thing driving me to keep reading; I was hoping to be shocked and truly blown away by something completely unexpected, and that just didn't happen.<br /><br />I just didn't like the book.  I'm not saying it was a bad book or poorly written because I didn't feel like that was the case.  As I said, I'm not a huge mystery reader so this could be an example of a great mystery and I just don't know it.  All I know is that it didn't work for me.<br /><br />I didn't like any of the characters at all.  I couldn't sympathize with them and they all seemed very unlikeable and bland.  I didn't like how the one lawyer's name was Logiudice and every time his name popped up I had to mentally pause and remind myself how to pronounce it.  I think this is a pet peeve of mine in books when characters have overly complex (in my opinion) names.<br /><br />I didn't find the ending shocking and I didn't care what happened to the characters by the time I got to the end of the book.  I also only read the book at night a little at a time and, because it's quite long, I felt like I'd wasted my time on the book because it took ages to finish.<br /><br />So I don't want to say it's a bad book.  It was quite easy to read and if I'd really hated it, I wouldn't have finished it.  As I said though, I wanted to see what the hype was about and was holding out for a shocking, Gone Girl-esque ending which, to me, never came.  Overall, I just didn't like it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I think this game is absolutely amazing. The graphics are insane, but the down side is that it takes up 1.9 GB of memory. The gameplay I would give a 4, The controls  a 3, but the rest are 5's.
0807014273|3.0|This is such a well-known book and I've been curious about it for some time.  However, I think I mixed it up with Night by Elie Wiesel because it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I thought there would be more about him and his experiences and observations.  Instead, the book was pretty heavy on psychology, more than I wanted to know or was interested in.<br /><br />However, for me, the value of this book is in illustrating how it's possible to find meaning in very dire circumstances.  While I'm not entirely sure that I agree with Frankl's explanations about finding meaning, I do admire him and his work.<br /><br />So this book wasn't as enjoyable because it wasn't what I'd expected.  I think I'll go read Night now and see if it's what I had initially wanted to read.  Still, I'm glad I got around to this work and was able to see what it's all about.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Whether you're an aging, arthritic Sabbath fan or an Osbourne reality show groupie, this book is hysterical.  But, I think people who grew up listening to Ozzy in all his different band forms will appreciate this personal history the most.  The way the book is written makes you feel like Ozzy is sitting next to you at a bar, getting buzzed, and spewing out his life story.  The language and the stories are intimate, and as I read it, I kept wanting more stories, more anecdotes, just more Ozzy!  I didn't want the book to end.  This is the funniest book I've ever read in my life.  It's lighthearted and totally not serious, and yet, it gives you an in depth personal view into Ozzy's life and those around him from his perspective.
1400069289|4.0|When this book first came out a lot of people were reading it and I just didn't feel drawn to it or see how it would be all that interesting to me.  But after seeing it over and over and people saying how informative and helpful it was to read it, I decided to pick it up.  And I ended up really enjoying it and it was a quick and easy read for me which I don't usually expect from non-fiction books.<br /><br />Basically this book is just what is sounds like as it talks about what makes up our habits and how powerful habits can be.  The book goes into how habits affect both individuals as well as organizations with a lot of interesting examples.  At the end there is an analysis of the difference between habits and addictions and whether we should be held responsible for things we do out of habit.<br /><br />Overall the book was really interesting.  There was a lot of science and different studies mentioned but it was never boring, mostly because it was interspersed with stories about real people.  The writing was very easy to read and understand.  At the end there were also suggestions for how to identify habits in your own life and then change them if they aren't benefiting you.<br /><br />While I don't think that humans are slaves to their habits, I can see the value of a book like this and understanding our behavior.  What it all comes down to is awareness of our actions and the desire to change them.  But I still found this book to be worthwhile and I was going to give it 3 stars but changed it to 4 because it was such an enjoyable read and I could see a lot of good in it.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to change a habit or just looking for a great non-fiction read.

1607066017|3.0|I'd been hearing about this book since it came out and just now finally got a copy from the library.  I have to say it was a little bit of a let down though after all the rave reviews, high Goodreads ratings, and other hype.  I loved Brian K. Vaughan's previous series, Y: The Last Man, so I was excited about this one.<br /><br />So maybe it was my expectation that resulted in feeling slightly disappointed, but I just wasn't blown away by it.  I really enjoyed the story, I liked the characters, the world was unique, and I'll definitely read the next one.  But I'm just not raving over it and telling every one to read it.<br /><br />Perhaps the story will develop even more and add more depth and interesting twists so I'll keep reading and see how it goes.  Still, it was a fun and unique read and I'd recommend it to fans of science fiction and graphic novels.<br /><br />The second volume comes out in July so I'll be on the lookout for a copy of that and it should be a really fun and easy read.

0393976041|5.0|This was my first time reading Pride & Prejudice all the way through.  I remember beginning it when I was younger and being unable to make it through the language and giving up on it.  But this book is so beloved that I knew I wanted to give it a try again.  I'd also been putting it off because so many people loved the experience of reading it for the first time and I anticipated feeling the same and didn't want that to be over once I'd read it.<br /><br />So I picked this book up fully intending to fall in love with it and have a huge book hangover.  It took me some time to get really sucked in but I definitely loved the book and it now holds a very fond place in my heart.<br /><br />There's really not much I can say because so many people have already read the book. I have seen the BBC miniseries many times in the past so I already felt familiar with the story and knew how it would end.  I'm really glad I watched that though and having read the book I have a newfound appreciation for how good that series is and how true to the book.  I think I might have missed out on some of the nuances of the book if I hadn't seen the show.<br /><br />So I realize my reading experience wasn't entirely pure.  I imagined all the actors in their various roles as I read.  But just reading the book was such a pleasure and the writing is so well done and easy to read.  There were a few parts where I had to go back and re-read carefully to catch the full meaning.  But these were few and far between.<br /><br />I was also a bit skeptical about the great love between Elizabeth and Darcy which is often the thing most people remember from the book.  On my reading I don't think it was the main plot point though.  Of course the book is a commentary on society and values and that was really at the center of it.  But it's hard not to get swept up in their story and really want them to be together!<br /><br />So all in all I absolutely loved this book!  I'm so glad I read it and I can definitely see myself re-reading it at some point in the future.  Although I know most of the stories of Austen's other books, I'm not looking forward to reading the rest of them for the first time!y see myself re-reading it at some point in the future.  Although I know most of the stories of Austen's other books, I'm not looking forward to reading the rest of them for the first time!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I really liked this movie, it's just what you expect to see...just like the Lord of the Rings - I was not surprised by much - met my expectations.
B0035YDM4Y|3.0|I have read some books of this type: &#34;Red Circle&#34;, &#34;No Easy Day&#34; ...all with the same scheme. When you separate the book from no doubt heroic actions Marcus was part of this book is quite pale. Very short paragraphs (battle action excluded) make it more a collection of snapshot than a movie (that I prefer). There are a lot of repetitions and at some points narrative is so politically biased that titers on the brink of propaganda. Anyway if you want to know what Red Wings op was all about you should read it and judge yourself.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved this movie, it's a great family movie...not only for kids but for the entire family, movie contains action, it's funny and super cute...I really enjoyed this movie and my whole family did too!!

B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is great having the 5ft. micro USB cable.  It is necessary to have because when the Kindle Fire battery power gets low and I want to continue reading, I can do so.

B00381A1MU|4.0|oh my my little guy had so much fun playing with this their is a payload in the car and it is magnetic to the crane my kid had loads of fun with this.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I found this to be a good film, but with all the hyperbole I'd heard, I expected it to be excellent, to blow me away.  I was interested and entertained, but not blown away by this tale of a young mystic who can see divinity in the eyes of a Bengal Tiger but does not understand its corresponding animal nature until his father forces him to witness it.  I was not really riveted by his miraculous survival in a life boat (with said tiger) after causing the ship he and his family had been on to sink by opening a door to the deck so he could experience a storm.  An interesting and miraculous journey of a young mystic who grows into a college professor of comparative religion.  Interesting but not riveting for this viewer.
B00AEBB8FQ|1.0|wow could not believe all of the  really foul language. move had some funny parts but really could not enjoy because of the diaglogue and I normally love Ben Still and Robert Downey Jr. very disappointed
1455526959|5.0|Michael Connelly is the master at crime fiction and continues to produce books of an amazing standard. I have come to know and love Harry Bosch over the past 20 years and enjoyed the flash back to the past in this novel. Great pace and suspense as always.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a book group read for me.  I was amazed how much emotion and love was expressed in this book through a dogs eyes.  You will fall in love with Enzo, and he will teach you things you thought you already knew.  A wonderful, heartwarming book!
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|This is the story of Terry Sparkes. A failed actor, he is reduced to catching glimpses of his hero, Sir Michael Brookes on TV. Tonight he is watching him at the Oscars, hoping he will win the double of best supporting actor, and best actor...<br /><br />Right off the bat I will admit I find short stories really hard to review, its so difficult to give a quick synopsis without giving away the entire story! That being said, on with the review. This was a lovely quirky little tale. It made a passing nod to Duncan's full length novel, 'The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club', which I have also read and enjoyed. This story had the same offbeat, slightly flawed characters, and the same vein of dark humour running through it. I would recommend this as an excellent introduction to Duncan's work. A nice, light easy read over a cup of coffee.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this story in exchange for my honest review.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun game but need additional ways to get coins and food. Also it is very \\"expensive\\" to clear areas out.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and love it each time.  When it is on TV some of the parts are cut out to make it on TV, so I wanted a copy of it to watch in full length.
B00C2IFMO2|4.0|I am about half finished with this marvelous biogrpahy or narrative history, really, of several men, but always focusing on Abraham Lincoln, the second greatest American after George Washington. This is a monumental work, a classic, and should be read by all Americans of all ages, esepcially those still struggling to understand the Civil War and its legacy. I can't say enough about this outstanding book, a masterpiece in its own right, and deserving of all its accolades. The only aspect I found troubling or take issue with is Kearns politcal correctness in early chapters where Lincoln and some of his associates, and also his roomate, slept in the same bed together, so she had to mention the posssible \\"Gay\\" factor, and explore this issue without really declaring whether it was true or not, in character with Lincoln's entire life. She probably introduced these two or three seedy comments to appease the Gay crowd or attempt to look fair with the appropriate level of diversity and tolerance, which unfortunately has nearly ruined modern historical study. Regardless, this is an incredible study of power, politics and governance.
B0037B6QSY|2.0|This came recommended by a friend. There are some good things I have taken away from the book, buy I think the points could have been made and then move on. I could not relate tohe some of the &#34;mystical&#34; ideas. The principles are valid though. I would probably not recommend it o a friend unless I knew they liked that particular style of writing.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Fun but takes too long with tutorial to play enough free to see if I want to pay for it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I watched the movie first, and absolutely loved it. Soon after I had to purchase the book because I've always found that the book is always better. I've only read the first one out of the trilogy, and am currently working on the second, but it has me sucked in. It's definitely a must read.
0823015017|4.0|an extremely well written book on color and color theory (one of the best i have seen).  I do wonder though how many people who<br />purchase it will actually do all these exercises?  they are rather complicated.  i had really considered returning this book but<br />then changed my mind (as i have a tendency to &#34;muddy&#34; my colors when i use clay but then figured that this book will<br />help me a lot.  Hopefully, when you master the color theories you can become an &#34;expert&#34;.

B00CDTSQZW|5.0|If you have seen this series on History Channel, I recommend buying the DVD/Blu-ray.  If you have not seen this series on History Channel, I wholeheartedly recommend buying the DVD/Blu-ray. It belongs on your shelf next to your copies of Deadwood, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, and Rome.  Good acting (Gustaf Skarsgård is outstanding), writing, set design.  Can't wait for Season 2.  Too bad it won't be until 2014, but hopefully it will be more than 9 episodes.    Hey History Channel!  Get a clue from yourselves!  More shows like this and &#34;Hatfields & McCoys&#34; and less like Pawn Stars!  Reality is insipid and played.  Leave that crap to TLC, which completed its transformation from The Learning Channel to The Loser's Channel with the premier of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.  Compelling, exciting historical drama is hopefully the new normal.  HISTORY!  An untapped mother lode of premises and plot lines.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The BK2 was my first survival/outdoor knife and I wanted something durable and well made and I've certainly found it with this knife.  I completely understand why this knife has the cult following that it does.  The sheath is sort of tough to get the knife out of initially but it gets easier after the plastic loosens up a bit.  The coating on the blade is very durable and the knife I received was the 2nd gen version with the laser etched logos.<br /><br />Buy this knife, you won't regret it!

B005LAIIJY|4.0|Not as great as some of the hype but still a good movie with some added in obvious comedy. Some of the special affects seemed cheesy when it came to people being hit by bullets but all in all I will keep the DVD
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This is a great watch. The first show had me hooked. The story lines are really interesting and keeps moving. If I ever needed legal advice I sure wish my lawyers looked like them!
B001TH16DI|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!!  Can't wait to start watching them!  He would never believe how inexpensive they were!!  Best buy anywhere!!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|What a show. Season Two was just as exciting as the first. I can't wait for Season three to be available.
1593082037|5.0|I really enjoy the Sherlock Holmes stories, not only for the interesting story but also for the immense vocabulary of Arthur Conan Doyle. My copy is quickly being filled with underlines and notes in the margins regarding obscure words or references of value.In this edition you will find an introduction and forward to the book from Kyle Freeman and I found his take on the novels to be very enlightening and learned quite a bit about Conan Doyle and the books from it.<br /><br />As far as the physical quality, it seems to be a rather durable copy. The pages are clearly and roughly cut after printing, one other reviewer remarked upon this as a negative, but I've been finding it a rather enjoyable quaint feature.
B004132HZS|5.0|This has been a really great show. I can't wait to see Season two. The show keep me on the edge and so much action.
157421327X|5.0|The book is wonderful, so many unique designs and more ideas for me to use in my stitching.  I love it, honestly.  The vendor is also a top-list vendor.  I hope to have many more transactions with them.
B002VX0A40|4.0|Bought this for my daughter because she was born in the year of the dragon. She is now 8 months old and loves this toy. Her favorite part is the mirror on the tail. I do have to monitor her when she plays with it and make sure she can't throw it around because there is a rattle that hangs from one hand and it hurts when it gets going (i know, i was at the receiving end of it). If your baby is at the &#34;toss everything around&#34; stage of life, then consider cutting the rattle off or keep a close eye when your little one plays with it.

B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I felt that this might have made a fine short story, but as a novel, it didn't work very well.  Too much repetition.  There was a lot of talking about himself by the main character but he really had little skill of introspection .

B00051E906|4.0|It seems work. The reading is consistent within a range. At least it gives me a peace of mind, just have it in case.
B001HN69AY|4.0|Such an added plus to find Tom Waits in a major role in this movie! He's an amazing character whether on stage or on film, and almost steals the show. I loved the strange way they dealt with the changing face of Heath Ledger after his tragic death, and somehow it tied into the reality of his passing as well as into the surreal bent of this film. Of course it could not help but remind me of The Seven Faces Of Doctor Lo which I remember from childhood.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Those people at Lego are all amazing.  This provided a great project for my wife and I, all the time scheming how we would ever get one of these VW buses for real.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This CD is the one I love the best of the two, but both are so satisfying and fabulous. It sweeps me back to the times he is writing about. He was the voice hidden behind all the other voices!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|From the very beginning this movie grabs you. It is a smashup of lawyer procedural meets anti-hero actioner.  Cruise is great as is everyone in the movie, which is well shot and well paced. I was reminded of good old movies like Bullet or even the original Dirty Harry movies. The story is a straight line with good characters and enough small twists to keep it interesting. I think, over time, this movie will gain a lot of respect as a solid fun piece of entertainment that is exciting without being to gross or exploitative.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This man is so mysterious; he's like the guy you met in the coffeehouse whom you never saw again but never forgot. His voice is entirely unique yet fit in perfectly for the era. I'm very sad about what happened or rather what should have happened but didn't in his life all those years ago, but he seems to be a man of phenomenal peace of mind; at least I hope so. Beautiful CD, thank you from then and now Rodriguez!

B00365EVWE|5.0|I wear earbuds *constantly* and I had a cheap set I liked but they were not very durable so I would buy replacements a lot. I got to the point where I always had a spare set for when the current ones broke. They were only $8 so it wasn't too expensive to keep buying more but I was always on the lookout for a new set that I liked that would maybe last longer.<br /><br />I always found something wrong with these new sets, crappy audio volume or quality, thin cords that tangled too easily, poor fit in my ears, etc.<br /><br />But I finally found a great pair that has lasted two months so far with no signs of wear or degrading quality. These Sennheiser CX 870s are loud, clear, durable, and they fit well. The noise attenuation is great too. I'm so glad I'm not throwing money away on those Samsungs I used to use.
0765334798|4.0|This is the third 2013 Hugo Award shortlist novel that I've read leading up to the awards and the best of the three by far (\\"2312\\" was so horrid I couldn't finish it and \\"Throne of the Crescent Moon\\" was meh at best).  I should also probably mention that SciFi is not my normal genre, so I'm not well-versed.  I just know what I like and what I don't.<br /><br />John Scalzi clearly had FUN writing this novel and it shows...I laughed myself silly throughout.  Now I'm going to be very, very careful not to spoil anything here and that requires that I only give you the following:<br /><br />Redshirts takes us to the year 2456, aboard the spaceship Intrepid where strange things are happening.  Far too many people meet with 'accidents' both aboard the ship itself and on their numerous away-missions.  It's inexplicable until our protagonist, Andrew Dahl, comes up with an explanation.  A bat-poop crazy explanation.<br /><br />Okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it for you, even though that's only the first 1/4 of the novel.  Anything else would ruin the fun for you.  The rest of the novel will twist your brain in a crazy set of calisthenics, but it's the most fun a person can have reading a sci-fi novel.<br /><br />Enjoy.

0307346617|5.0|World War Z is very well written & a very well thought out book. Max Brooks takes a different angle on the zombie apocalypse than most - he gives humanity a chance to figure out how to survive. I really enjoy the different approaches each country takes toward handling the zombie problem. Like I said, it is a very creative & well thought out book. I've already read it twice, and it may be one of the few books that I would find myself reading for a third time some time in the future.
0061950726|4.0|Beginning in the 1850's and ending in the 1920's trains loaded with orphan or abandoned children from the East Coast traveled across the country to the Midwest where they were adopted by families. Older boys often became extra labor on farms. Occasionally the children had fairy tale endings. More often, the children encountered harrowing circumstances with families that saw them as free workers instead of loving them as children. In her novel Orphan Train, Christina Baker Kline weaves the stories of Vivian who traveled from New York City to Minnesota on the Orphan Train and Molly, a teenage girl stuck in the foster care system in Maine. Heart-breaking at times but also filled with moments of hope and redemption, Orphan Train is an emotional read that pierced my heart.<br /><br />Perhaps it was my own personal ties to Minnesota and Maine--places that I love. Perhaps it was the stories from my own great-grandmother who was \\"farmed\\" out to live with another family in another Minnesota town after her parents' divorce. She changed her name from Oral Olive Smith to Eleanor Bellsum and skipped a grade by telling the teacher at the new school that she was in 4th grade instead of 3rd. She would return home a year later after her mother remarried but the experience would leave a lasting impression. Mostly, it was the tender and thoughtful writing and the tragic, love-less story of Vivian in Orphan Train that nearly had me crying by the final pages. While Vivian faces terrible circumstances in her young life that will inevitably shape the person she will become, she has the chance to redeem herself--to show love to another and discover her family.<br /><br />The writing is much richer during Vivian's early years and less so when talking about Molly's life. This may be intentional since Vivian's story on the orphan train is most central to the plot. The ending loses some steam and there are later events in Vivian's life that could have been developed more since they were so obviously a result of her earlier life. But overall, Kline combines an interesting page in US history with careful story-telling to create a compelling novel of hope, faith, forgiveness and redemption. It's just a lovely, lovely book.<br /><br />There is the occasional use of the F-word in the book.iously a result of her earlier life. But overall, Kline combines an interesting page in US history with careful story-telling to create a compelling novel of hope, faith, forgiveness and redemption.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|To his credit somewhat, Ridley Scott, visual maverick and visionary director - had moved on from Alien when he approached this project and clearly didn't want to replicate the genre he had created and others had built on.  Instead, Scott delivers an old-fashioned existentialistic sci-fi film with a plot that feels more early 1970s than the post-modern look it offers.<br /><br />The challenge appears to be: one can't go back anymore to Alien - but you still need to rope in the faithful, so what do you do?  You revive some familiar elements, dash it with a cryptic 2001: A Space Odyssey opening; get Michael Fassebender to channel David Bowie (from The Man Who Fell to Earth); go where no man has gone before ala Star Trek, and try to infuse the meaning of life into this space opera.  Casting wise, Noomi Rapace is capable, but she's no Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron's character is far more intriguing & edgier and should have been given more to do.  While Michael Fassbender pretty much carries the show.<br /><br />Visually, Prometheus is a nice film and the cast do a good job - but overall the film is too bright (you feel like you're standing in a florescent room); the pacing is too slow to be scary and it telegraphs its moves.  Understandably, Ridley Scott is an elder statesman of film.  He's still got the visual chops and art direction, but in creating a deliberate Kingdom of Heaven style of film in space, it all becomes a bit pedestrian.  At times we are intrigued; at other times, we feel we've seen it before and it's coming at us as it always has - but somewhat slowly.<br /><br />So that's what Prometheus leaves me: a mixed bag experience with moments of wonder and moments of B-movie.  The Alien franchise has not been particularly upped or enhanced by this, and Ridley's original film will remains the true classic that defined a genre.  Where the original was gripping and engaging - Prometheus will come across somewhat cold and removed in its emotional core.
B005LAIGLO|3.0|The movie stereotype is your friend will put your family in harms way over drug money.  That is about all this movie is good for. I wouldn't buy it.  The scene where he takes part in raid in Panama with swat team there shooting at them didn't seem real. No way anyone in real life would have gotten out of that.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I really like this game its both challenging and easy at the same time the 4 stars I rated was because you have to get a certain number of badges to move on to another island I'm slightly mad but I'm fine create the best bridge ever... to pass
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I ordered this wand for my wife because she has always been a huge harry potter fan. When I gave it to her, she was excited because it was a cool looking wand, but when I told her that it worked as a remote, she got super excited. When we learned the spells and programmed the wand to the tv, she got even more excited and felt completely magical!<br />  The wand looks great, has a good weight and feel to it. It is a little tricky to get the spells right sometimes, but it is really fun and entertaining. Programming the wand is quite easy and it comes with very well written instructions (parchment style). Any Harry Potter fan and anyone who wants to feel a little magical would love this!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Lots of combos,  very relaxing.  I listen every night.  I chronically have trouble sleeping and this really helps to relax me and let me wind down for sleep
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|I would like to have in CD the BLANCO Y NEGRO Concert in live, that was base for this production
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this game is spectacular really and sorry about the title I tried to troll you but anyway this game is really good and I really like it
1419705849|5.0|These books are very popular with the grade school set--especially the boys.  They love reading them. And there are movies too.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I love dystopian novels and I love series novels.  Consequently I have a slightly lower threshold for these than regular stand alone non-dystopian stories.  This book benefits from this.  The idea of this series is very good, the writing is good and the characters are also good.  The sequel moves the story along fairly well and is not entirely a placeholder story as too many Book Twos of trilogies tend to be.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|Characters replicate Disney's animated version but lack the spirit. Robin Williams is not up to his normal hyper-driven standard. Dustin Hoffman plays Captain Hook broadly but effectively. Bob Hoskins is Smee. The rest of the stellar cast, Maggie Smith et al, are wasted on a bloated script that might have been saved by tighter editing.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I had forgotten how many of my favorite songs he did.  What an incredible journey!!! Recomended to anyone who likes Van Morrison.
B00CDFWJIG|1.0|I bought the movie many days ago and can not get it to stream for more then ten minutes and tonight it says it unavalible. Cant watch a movie at ten minutes a night.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book, I fell in love with all the characters and over all  the plot kept me interested. I recommend it if you are looking for a fun read.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is absolutely gorgeous! The story itself is great and captivating, in a dramatic novela sort of way. But the stages and images are absolutely breathtaking. Watch this movie, even if its purely for aesthetic reasons.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Exactly what i expected and definitely what I needed. Amazing performances overall. I especially liked the choice of &#34;High Wire&#34; which drew me to this album in the first place.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is definitely a great movie for young adults and kids. My little brother loves it, but you can't expect less from Studio Ghibli.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|Amazing view of different ways to spiral into drug induced despair and disaster. One of the most artistic movies I've seen, but very dark. No redemption or happy endings.....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Okay this is an erotic book the author does describe each sexual act so if that is not your thing don't waste your time because you will hate this book.  I love the book, I love Gideon and Cary.  Eva made me tired going back and forth back and forth, I will be reading the next book to see what happens in their relationship.  Now the murder that was a little scary, because he did plan every detail. I think the author could have written that a different way.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Love the jeep game, but frustrating to locate some of the animals that are further away.<br />Trying now to locate a source of peanuts to replenish my gas. Hope I don't have to pay for them, as I will then stop playing.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The story was a &#34;run of the mill&#34;. Nothing special to keep one turning the pages. Good story but nothing out of the ordinary.
B009QW85ZU|5.0|Watched all of the earlier Movies, up until this Movie and I must say this is one of the best.<br /><br />The realism displayed within this Movie is on par with real life scenarios and results.<br /><br />For instance in the beginning; when one goes to the Home, one would expect the kind of care he had received.<br /><br />But seriously, the directors did a great job pushing the envelope of making sure the audience was being entertained by believable actions.<br /><br />The only thing a James Bond fan is going to miss with this particular Movie, are the one liners after he kills or somebody has had an accident.  I never understood this until I read some blurbs about licensing issues, then the pieces fell together.  (ie. See Never Say Never Again Wikipedia, \\"was not produced by Eon Productions\\")<br /><br />As a likely result, this Movie likely set the bar for all future James Bond Movies! ;-)<br /><br />2013.06.02: Edited some sentences for enhanced clarity.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I am not professional critic but here goes. In my opinion this book was not the least bit entertaining. I had to force myself to finish. I skimmed through much of the exhausting banter but found little gratification in the personal accounts. I finish what I start so I made it to the end but only because of my ocd not because it was a nail biting page turner. Hope the movie is better.
B0039PPW60|5.0|I'm not a musical genius, but this mixer is fantastic thus far.  I've only had it a few days.  We purchased it for our church's sound system to upgrade from a Behringer Eurorack 1202 for the USB connectivity.  What a difference it made in our livestream application as well b/c everything now is being routed from the mixer to the computer.  Haven't used the record setting yet, but I expect it to be second to none.  It's worth the money.  The instructions to hook it up could be a little more clearer, but other than that, it's a great mixer thus far.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very similar to taking care of a real showhorse. You don't have to spend real money to play the game, unless you want to.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I did not realize this was only for android and i only have a Kindle so am unable to rate.
B005LAIHCW|3.0|This isn't the horror movie I was expecting or hoping for. It was really different than what the trailer made me think it was. Which, can be a good or bad thing.<br /><br />\\"House at the end of the Street\\" takes original ideas and creates an interesting story, yet it is still unoriginal.<br /><br />The villain could have been better I think. When I found out who the villain was, this person didn't strike me as scary enough to pull off the suspense the movie attempts to create. In other words, the villain didn't seem to be much of a threat in the end. Yes, the villainous stuff was demented. It was still suspenseful. No, it wasn't really that scary. The acting on the part of the villain was not good enough to convince me or make me feel afraid. The story was good but nothing surprising.<br /><br />None-the-less. I liked the movie. I may eventually add it to my collection of movies but not at any time soon, unless I find a copy for a really good price.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|This album is so bright, so exciting, so dancy, and so beautiful. Patrick's voice has never been more exuberant and thrilling. So much goodness.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|If you're a fan of the series, you won't be disappointed.  Definitely keeps you hooked and looking forward to the conclusion of the series!
B000B8QG22|5.0|Robin Williams made having been in Vietnam fun.  He was crazy in this movie and we all loved him.  Thanks Robin.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|i LOVE ANIMALS ESPECIALLY BIG CATS AND I HAVE A 60' TV.  WATCHING THIS ON MY TV WAS GREAT.  I WOULD WATCH IT MANY TIMES
B009K86D86|5.0|Good. Stuff. But always look at the bright side too. I d watch it again. And I don't its always like that.  If you don't like it what you see. Go pay 3 times as much for something it will make you feel better. Such as organic and stuff. Ron get me wrong I wish everything was organic and happy cow chickens and pigs.  But I won't pay more for it to be happy. That's life and that's the way it is.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I liked this movie because it was not boring and enjoyed it very much.  Great actiing and it deserved Best picture
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love it. It  would be 5 stars, if the alarm sound had a crescendo volume. Where the alarm tone started low, and slowly rises. That's the only thing that I'd like changed. Great app, still.
B0082Z447U|5.0|and well worth the read.  I have read several times and have given as gifts and made my book club read!  I can not say how much I like this book.  It is a must read for no other reason that it is the book that started the genre.  Wilkie Collins was a contemporary of Dickens and writes with the same flare for characters, but not quite the extremes.  It is a great romp through the strict social rules and limitations of the time period.  Makes me thankful I live in this century but also yearn for the simplicity of an earlier time.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|great movie, great actors.  If you love period movies and are into history this movie is a must see.  I learned a lot from the movie as well
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter at her request, and she was thrilled.<br />She said she is really enjoying the books.<br />Highly recommended.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Great ideas, a lot of thinking to be done, but a lot of doing to be done. Definitely a recommended book.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I suppose there must always be a beginning and only Hollywood has license to revert to the past--via the future. Not bad, though I find the budding romance between Uhura and Spock a bit---shall we say---lacking in realism given Star Trek's past.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I admit, I am a sucker for a good animal story and this is it! A person's life told through the eyes of his dog. Wonderful.
0385535147|5.0|This is one of John Grisham's best. It keeps you wondering until the end of the book. I was not disappointed .
0553062182|2.0|I really had high hopes for this book and very much wanted to find some usable tools for myself.  Sadly, I found this book to be all over the place.  One moment I'm reading snippets of case studies to back up the authors ideas, and on the next page she is giving a quick &#34;how to&#34; exercise on regression therapy.  None of it seemed in depth, not even her data, and I find &#34;how to&#34; boxes on things like regression therapy bizarre and unhelpful with such little information, preparation, and guidelines for the person attempting it. Sprinkled throughout were the constant personal experiences and cases, which I usually enjoy in books where I'm trying to get my head around new concepts, ideas,or ways of thinking. Instead of helping to flesh out and support the concepts, they just felt scattered and indulgent to me.  I think about 5% of the book was helpful.  I had hoped to pass it on to my dad, who is a Dr. of behavioral psychology because I thought it would be a topic he'd be very interested in, but the quality of the overall text was so low I didn't bother.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game and play it all the time.  The best part is getting new people.  It keeps them busy all day.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|As a huge Cinderella fan since the beginning and knowing Tom's talents were off the charts, I expected nothing less than perfection on this and let me tell you, it is so solid from start to finish. I wish it didn't take so long for this to come out, but it is so worth the wait.  If you like rock-n-roll, honkytonk, blues, jazz, and some southern hospitality, please tune in....you will love it..very few have the ability to put out this kind of material these days.  I usually like to comment on a few tunes on my reviews, but with this one what's the point?!  Are you kidding me, this is so fabulous from start to finish it's scary.  Thank you Mr. (and Mrs.!) Keifer for an amazing effort and I am sure this is going to be quite a ride with this album as there is NO WAY this can be denied!!  great job....
0553385461|5.0|then you don't understand it well enough.<br /><br />Based on this idea, Professor Hawking must have the subject under control. Like many people I read this book based on its reputation. I doubt that many people wake up one day and think that a nice spot of cosmology would be in order. Happily there was no disappointment. What I got from this book was an insight into a wonderful topic that would be largely inaccessible otherwise. How could someone ask for more - a view of what makes all existence tick.<br /><br />Sadly, I can't critique this book on the validity of it's substance - that is well beyond my experience and understanding. I suspect though that if you were in that position there would be no need for you to read this book anyway. Based on Professor Hawking's CV though I would be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Don't believe though that you won't find some parts of this book complicated and quite astounding. There were a number of parts that made me stop and think, and then re-read and then stop and think again - with a number of parts getting several repeats of this process. If we don't start somewhere though then we won't learn anything. With that in mind I think the lay person will be in for some great thought exercises.<br /><br />This is a pretty quick read though - a good afternoon and evening will take care of it for many people but for mine it's a book I look forward to re-reading as I am sure my comprehension of many concepts presented would be superficial (at best - given the topic). Overall, I think that because a number of the concepts are presented in an almost philosophical fashion, it enables comprehension of some fantastic topics and makes for a fun and interesting read.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's always fun to play games like this one. They're one of my favorites. The only problem I have is waiting to complete the quests. I guess this game teaches patience.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|Its not as loud as some of their previous work, but its also not as poppy. It took a bit of an indy role, but not entirely. Its an album that you can listen to all day and relax. Honestly, I kind feel like if you were to play only the music and remove the vocals of haley williams, i dont think anyone would be able to tell that this was paramore. I am still a fan of this album though. Haley is the bomb...
B009OYTAL8|5.0|My wife and I started watching this show and quickly became hooked on it.  After being Smallville fans for years we were leary of a new Green Arrow character and a show with no super powers.  However the writing and the story kept us involved and we shortly became addicted to the series.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves these things.  Pretty steap price for a pacifier but she loves them.  One for the mouth and two more to stick her index finger into the binky. She is 2 yrs old and i have had a supply of these around since birth.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love everything about this game with one exception: it really drains the battery! Otherwise it's a great jigsaw app.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I play sitar and I noticed there was a five note raga scale and several minor scales. I enjoy making geometrics to represent sound. Easy to learn without hardly reading the instuctions. like the key changer too!
B004I2K4DY|3.0|I love Les Miserables the musical.  It is my all time favorite.  I have both version of Les Mis, 10th and 25th anniversary &#34;in concert&#34; and also the Les Mis the movie.  Do not enjoy watching the 25th anniversary much.  It is something that I would prefer to borrow from a library and watch it one time.  I cannot wait for Les Miserables to have a full production of the musical just as Phantom of the Opera 25th anniversary.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|It is a very interesting and exciting book once started i could not put it down so I had a couple of late nights
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is a full production with, if I am not mistaken, over 140+ casts.  I was pleasantly surprise that this is not a concert, as Les Mis anniversary, but an actual production.  The singing is amazing by all the major roles.  Excellent casting.  Sierra Boggess, is absolutely incredible in the role of Christine.  I think she stole the show from the Phantom.  Perhaps the staging and the camera angles increase her present and decrease the Phantom's.  But this is a must have for Phantom of the Opera fans and for people who love musicals.
B00821PCJS|5.0|We're being inundated with &#34;disaster&#34; and &#34;Post Apocalyptic&#34; films/shows. Fortunately for us, this is another really well thought out script with nicely done special effects. I'm glad I checked it out. You do it too, you won't be sorry.
0061134007|4.0|Jo Nesbo had been recommended but I was not able to find the first of the series in the library so kept putting it at the end of the list. Happen to grab this one for my Kindle and now will definitely be reading this series, but will go back and start from the beginning even if I have to buy them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent game! Challenges the mind and yet is a ton of fun!!! I highly recommend it to EVERYONE!!!! You can pick it up at anytime and put it down!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A Touching, funny and brilliant movie. I'd watch it 20 times more if I had the time in the day!
1451696191|5.0|I first watched the movie. Then i had to read the book. It was definatly a great choice! This is a must for high school students!
B004IPPINW|4.0|The basic premise of the book is good and it envelopes the reader fully.  There are loose ends that  makes one feel unsatisfied at the close of the dialogue.
B000B8QG22|5.0|robin williams is and was the perfect man to make this movie he brought out the real lives of our troops
B00005O5CM|5.0|I loved this movie...she played her part so well, this movie was so well done.<br />entertaining, funny, and her acting was just adorable
B000BZISTE|5.0|a funny look at our man and women that had a lot of things going on in there lives during the war
034553154X|5.0|Just needed a calendar. Has 12 months. Fan of ASOIAF so this was perfect. Nice artwork with themes  spanning all 5 novels
B000P0J09C|5.0|showed the pain  and agony of our troops and the aspect of torments and trials that our troop go thru
B00BZOFUI2|3.0|it had its moments of old dp.some songs were  dp lite ,could have been more rockin and I know gillan cant sing like he use to
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|its a firm that fullfills the rest of the other worlds a great fillm for the make beleive great photography
B009AMANBA|3.0|After seeing many Lincoln movies, this was a let down.  I was dissappointed with Sally Fields role.  It did not use so much of her tallent.  Daniel Day-Lewis did not reach the point of believeablilty.  I was very dissappointed with knowing that it had received Oscar nominations.  Expected a lot more from the movie.
B00B2OSZIW|2.0|This grip does not allow access to the battery or SD card and the grip is not that much of an improvement.  I ended up getting a RRS grip -- that is super with openings for the battery and the SD card.  The grip is exceptionally comfortable.
B004SIP71M|4.0|Meryl Streep plays a nun, who is very sure of her convictions.  When she feels that their is something wrong, she set about to change it.  This is a great performance from her.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|As a long time fan of RoboCop I was very pleased to get this great collection on Blu-ray at a reasonable price.  Highly recommended!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Did not hold my interest.  Really not what I expected, because of all the hype it was given.  Would not recommend this to any one.
0307476073|4.0|I really liked this book. It's well written and well-paced.  I definitely recommend it and think it should be required reading for women. We should all be so brave.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The best series I've ever watched! I seldom get into a show where I will watch multiple episodes ,this was a first.
0812993845|5.0|Totally worth reading for the Divorce fantasy alone. Its very funny and well-paced. I liked it better than her last few books. The characters were well-rounded, and more like functional adults. It was better than I expected it to be.
B00CC1JXYE|4.0|This case is good but could be a lot better, the S View feature is working perfect, but there are some things that are bothering me, like the kickstand feature is not that good, you can't put the phone on a soft surface like a mattress, because it will fall. Also they said that the case will protect the phone, but it doesn't feel very solid. And finally the phone becomes very thick, and when you are going to use the camera the front cover blocks the lens. I'll keep it, buy maybe i'll use another case.<br /><br />Edit: Check the new pictures i've added<br />1. [...]<br />2. [...]<br />3. [...]<br />4. [...]
0374214913|4.0|The title is a bit misleading on this one. I expected something different. But its a really good story, with interesting characters and a good premise. I recommend it.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|My daughter is reading this book for High School and though it is a dark story the book is very well written.
B00B1EGP44|5.0|This is one of my favorite fun movies to watch. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Jurassic Park. #2 in the series was pretty blah but this one has all the right elements from good acting, to humor, to the moral questions around resurrecting an extinct species. All around good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because you get a lot of cool boxes that give you keys and new people and cool skateboards. That's all you know.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This movie is on my personal top 10 list and in 3D just that much better. I really, really am quite taken in by this movie and I've seen it at least 20 times.
078322740X|5.0|This movie makes me laugh. I'm replacing one tape at a time for a DVD starting with my favors first...and this one just lifts my spirits on a cloudy day.
0385349947|4.0|This is all good advice for women on the executive track who sit in board rooms and attend conferences and majored in business or management and then can transfer those skills to a variety of companies making a variety of products or tech things or money management things.<br /><br />I wonder how it translates for lower level employed women; those trying to break out of the secretarial pool -- now disguised as administrative assistants or program analysts. Still secretaries. How about those working in call centers, or in manufacturing lines, or in school systems, retail or service industries. What do we do to lean in?<br /><br />I enjoyed it. It was well-written and researched. It had a great personal touch. But it is about moving in a world of commerce that might as well be on another planet.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I'm currently a high school exchange student in South Korea, so naturally I am fascinated and horrified by the injustices that continue to occur in the North. What this book lacks in flowery prose and artsy metaphors, it more than makes up for by being completely and brutally blunt about the squirm-inducing, jaw-dropping cruelty that North Korean detainees are forced to endure daily. This book certainly not a leisurely read, and probably not an enjoyable one, but if the way it has affected me in just six hours is any indicator of how it will influence others, it will change your life. It is shocking and terrifying that something this evil could happen- and it's still happening just a few hundred miles north of me as I write this, mind you- in a post-Holocaust world where every American high school kid is required to read \\"Night\\" by Elie Viesel. It's even more terrifying that we can just ignore the existence of these camps, despite widespread knowledge of their existence and if the atrocities that occur within their fences each and every day. In the word s of Elie Viesel, \\"The opposite of love is not hate. It is indifference.\\" Something needs to happen to help these people. I'm just a sixteen year old girl, so I don't know what can be done, or how it can be made possible, but it just has tobe soon.
B0013E5HEG|5.0|Bought the family & king reigns supreme. This guy is realistic & even a bit fierce looking, but my grandson took him to bed & cuddled with him the first day... even though he is not what I would consider a cuddle cat! Although another reviewer mentioned that these are not toys, but rather works of art, they are worth the investment for any kid who is an animal lover. I will keep adding to my grandson's cat collection & am disappointed that the panther is not available.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I like all Tom Cruise movies, so I guess I'm biased but this movie has all the great essentials to a B-A movie! Action, ridiculous explosions, hand to hand combat, guns, cool cars, and decent acting.  The story was great too, I'm no movie expert, but if you like action movies with Tom Cruise, then this movie is for you!
B005RDF2NA|2.0|ok...so...my daughter and I love Shrek.  I purchased this from Amazon instant video because our Blu-ray was scratched beyond repair.  I thought maybe I would try this service to see how it worked out for us.  Unfortunately, I had a difficult time connecting, took at least 20 minutes each time.  NO, it is not my connection, my connection is great.  We love the movie itself, but this online service just didn't cut it for us :(
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|I've bought about 4 different versions of this from off name brands and all of them were cheap and ended up breaking within 2 weeks of having them.  The amount of money I spent on those, easily paid for this, so although its a bit pricey for a cable, dont waste your money on other products, spend the extra few bucks on this cause its built to last.  Much thicker cable, built with quality in mind, and worth every penny!!!
B00AIJP9BS|3.0|Twiddled for 20 minutes against the computer to give it a try, but could never score a goal. The &#34;gravity field&#34; around each player slows the game down considerably, and it is not easy to find the right amount of &#34;kick&#34; to propel the ball in the right direction without kicking it wholly out of bounds. Good try, but not very fun to play.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Why on Earth would you not buy it? Their sound has changed slightly over the span of all their albums, but its still great music. There are some really top notch songs on this one.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Wonderful to have these all together and with bonus features. Nice packaging, looks great on screen. Glad to have it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a very fun and very addictive game.  I'm having a blast playing and i don't purchase any extra coins.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|Yergin's ability to bring the most accurate and detailed history into an intriguing and exciting format is amazing.  I have been an engineer in the oil and gas business for over 20 years and no book has ever gotten me so excited about my industry as this one.  It should be required reading for anyone in the business!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|As always Michael Connelly does not disappoint his reader. Just when you think you know who the person is for the crime, you find out your are wrong. I love reading the Harry Bosch series. Be sure and begin with the first of Michael Connelly writings. He never disappoints his audience.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This ia absolutely my favorite of all the bingo games. I love the challenges to get the awards and the interaction with other people who enjoy this game as much as I do. If you are looking for something relaxing this is a great game for that.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|All of the Harry Bosch series is great. I do not believe any reader will be disappointed when purchasing Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This was always one of my favorite movies as a kid, and I love it even more as an adult.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|great buy at half price. a must have for any video collection.  all three movies in one tight package (three separate blue ray dvds in one case). perfectly remastered. there is no try. you do or you do not.  and they did this well.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|fun but the suits shouldn't have to repair after each run and they should make a free roam mode or atleast walking around things
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game it is Good that it has different tasks to do. I think it is great for kids and adults.very fun and makes time go past.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is book is an absolute must read if you are currently trying to find solutions to your cravings.. and understanding why you must have the empty calories..
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|This is a good series for teenagers or someone looking for an easy read, I will continue to buy the remaining books to see how it all turns out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|She's addicted to it on her kindle. Fun game !<br />She loved Temple Run and if you like Temple Run you will like this !
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This first season wa so enthralling. I have time off between Christmand and New Year, so I sat down to watch this and began a marathon of this season as I could not step away from it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game as well as my 6 year old.... we both enjoy it and have a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend. This game for anyone!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|The format is sleek on computer and tablet (I haven't tried it on my smartphone). It's a seamless transition from Reader. Only complaint is that all my tags seem to b lost forever.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Being a virgin to this series, and hearing by word of mouth, i assumed this would be amazing.. like a virgin this first for me kinda let me down a bit :/<br /><br />Fun read was expecting more with all the positive reviews, but the action just didn't feel suspenseful enough. The first 30% is fast paced but then it drags a bit until the last 10%. I don't know why he couldn't add just a few more pages at the end. However mediocre it was, I'm gonna try another from the series.
B00A8LYYI0|2.0|Look, I know that sequels are often not as good as originals, but the original Silent was not that good to begin with, so I had some hopes that the sequel MIGHT improve upon it. Well, it didn't. Story, acting and editing were equally horrible. What good acting talent there was, were kept in secondary, forgettable parts. And the 3D? Dreadful.  Reinforced my general opinion that the whole 3D hype is just that, hype by studios hoping to create extra bucks. The 3D was fuzzy, weak, and added even more to the film's lack of anything worthwhile. I would watch it again in regular 2D, except the movie is just too awful to warrant that kind of time. Stay away.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Had high hopes for this. Book jumped around so much you couldn't enjoy or appreciate what was going on at certain points in the story. Characters were believable, however not interesting. Unable to really \\"bond\\" with the characters. Story line was good. Time period was a good setting. Would definitely no recommend this book.
B000FA675C|5.0|havent gotten all the way through it yet but its very promising, I've been told to read it a million times so i finally got it for free and figured id give it a shot :)
0719079276|5.0|Peter Barry includes all the possible theories one can apply when analyzing literarture and gives examples of each one. I recommend this read.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|If you enjoy good music, you must add this cd to your collection.  The Lumineers are incredibly talented and this album is incredible from start to finish.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game, but not when it freezes or causes you to lose credits that you have paid for. Pretty frustrating.
B0000A7W14|5.0|Awesome street gang movie. It reminded me of South Central, another great film. This movie takes you into the world of gangs in the US. From crack cocaine production/marijuana use and distribution to drive-by shootings, a car jacking and a toddler asking for a sip of alcohol from one of the OGs (original gangster or old school founding member of a gang) sitting on a porch. Spoiler Alert: Sad story as the ending is tragic. I won't go into details as I don't want to ruin it for those who have not seen it. Must watch!
B009JBZH54|1.0|Bought this as a gift, and the second disc, The Dark Night, would pause and skip around, and ultimately would stop playing near the end. Tried in my Samsung Blu Ray player, and my Dell laptop. No go.<br />Returned it, got a new one, and SHOULD have watched it right away to make sure the issue had been solved. As I never had an issue with a disc before, I thought it'd be fine. Finally go to watch it tonight, and first it won't play. Player says the disc did not meet specifications. Restarted the player, and now it's freezing, and skipping minutes ahead. I'm doubting it will make it to the end of the movie. Now I am past my return window.<br />Bad move, Amazon. Guess I'll try to complain elsewhere....
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is a very cute game I put it on my kindle fire for my grandkids but iv been playing g it more than them. I love it.
B00169N0BK|5.0|to buy one of these.  cant imagine how much ink and paper i've wasted in the past.  great product.  this product doesnt make up for knowing profiles, inks, paper, and your printer...
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|best iron man game for the. kindle fire. I love the gameplay and the look of  the characters. plus the armors are well made with specials and weapon fire. best game iron man takes over!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!My son enjoys being able to navigate this game and exploring the subway. Just wish he had more coins to get to the levels.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Well done prequel.  If you own this trilogy, this is a necessity.  It does not disappoint.  Same core production values as the trilogy.
B0034G4OYK|4.0|I got this for my 3D collection.  It has decent number of effects popping off the screen. So it is worth the extra for 3D., The plot was fine for a younger crowd.  Not scary or too spooky. Will be glad to watch it several more times with the Wee ones.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The Hobbit in 3D was cool. I enjoyed the move a lot, it was worth every penny I paid (though I would have liked to get the little booklet that came with Walmart's version, for the same price). Anyway, Being the prequel to  the &#34;Lord Of The Rings&#34;, I'm looking forward to the other movies in the story line. BUT, My hang up was that the 3D was poorly mapped out in the movie. There was some blurry 3D scenes in the movie that took away from the quality of the movie. The movie without the 3D effects was easier to watch and enjoy.
0765365278|2.0|I really appreciate an author that puts out a book over 500 pages. With the cost of books these days it is the only way to get your money's worth. Although I found half of the book to be an enjoyable quick read the other half tended to drag down the momentum. I didn't mind this initially because the book is supposed to be the opening of a 10 part series.  Now 3 years after initially reading it, Sanderson may have the second book out before the end of the year.  At this rate I will be hanging out with Robert Jordan discussing how the wheel of time spins on before Sanderson completes the final book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does everything I want it to do in a very simple format. What more can you say about a calculator?
0525953728|5.0|I research things prior to buying and this was exactly what I wanted. The book was used and arrived much sooner than expected. In my opinion the book was also in better condition that was listed. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in military operations and Amazon to anyone in search for any item. It deserves the rating I gave.
B00340O3KQ|4.0|This movie is great. Lots of Action, great story line, and wonderfully cast. I would watch this again at anytime.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you have not read this book because everyone is talking about how dirty it is....well it's a story about love and being true to yourself and being open minded.  I have read all 3 books 3 times.  I am so in love w/Christian Grey.  This series of books are the best books I have read in a very long time.  IT IS A MUST READ!!<br />LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!
B009CGR416|5.0|If You are a gamer, or if you like video games, you will find this movie enjoyable. If you don't you will find it rather silly and cartoonish. I love the movie because I am a gamer and I do find this movie silly and cartoonish.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read this book and I loved it.  However, I was so depressed after it was done because I was like, now what, no more Christian, I was addicated so I re-read all 3 books again 3 MORE TIMES!! I got my fix and so can't wait for the movie to come out!!<br />THIS IS SUCH A GREAT READ!!! Christian will live in my heart forever.......
B00B0HXC4I|1.0|I dont understand the praise in the metal community surrounding this overly contrived band and album.  Those that take this seriously need to question thier knowledge/awareness of rock and metal. This is about as rock/metal as a seaseme street soundtrack.  I get it.. i'm sick of (and never liked) the growl vocals in metal and you can only tune a guitar so low and add so many strings......  BUT are we really this desperate for something different? Apparently yes.  Is this Metal? No. Is this satanic? Sure in the same way the Heaven's Gate cult was.  In fact the singer sounds like he also had his attachments removed.<br /><br />As many have said the guitar tone is a throwback to the 70s, nothing wrong with that, but this is not a metal album.  Taken on its own, Ghost is unique but far from heavy and dark and satanic in the traditional sense.  The vocalist is very weak and monotone with a very limited range, he's embarrassing himself trying to hit the high notes (check out \\"Elizabeth\\").  How this guy ever got in a band to begin with would read something along the lines of \\"hey if you let me sing my mom will sew our costumes and let us use her makeup\\".  This is truly that juvenile in scope.<br /><br />Comparing Ghost along side Mercyful Fate/King Diamond or even BOC and Voivod is apples and oranges, those bands are heavy and dark, this is thin thin and about as dark as mid day.  This album is trying too hard to mesh things that haven't been combined in the traditional sense, whether or not you find that to be ground breaking is a matter of taste.  Catholic imagery, makeup, and comically sung satanic lyrics do not make a rock band. It makes for a show.  A show not far removed from what Motley Crue pulled of in the early 80s, and about as deep.  Ghost success is truly a sign of how stale music has become and also how it continually tries to reinvent itself.  Being different for the sake of being different is all this is about.  In the end Ghost comes off about as sincere as a used car salesman.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't wait to read part 2.  I was falling apart at the seams reading this book, I was reading at work, in the restroom, staying up to late reading this book.  Christian to me is lick an adiction, I need and want him all the time.  The things this man does to me....<br />once again LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!
B009MO5G90|2.0|I've been watching the Resident Evil movies since the very first, and played the games before that. I've enjoyed them for being fun, somewhat over the top action flicks that value style over substance and deal out bullets and explosions by the bucketful. It's a fine balance, and with Retribution, that balance was tipped.<br /><br />I say that because, for the duration of the movie, I felt like I was waiting for the opening action scene to end and the movie to actually begin. From the moment Alice wakes up in Umbrella's underwater facility, we're treated to an onslaught of explosions, evil computers, and cartoonish side characters battling them. And while that's all well and good, the movie never really left that gear. Essentially, the whole of the plot (save for the last few moments) could be boiled down to 'escape the facility'. At least the first movie had 'prevent the T-Virus from escaping' as a subplot.<br /><br />The movie wasn't helped by it's direction, either. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong, but something about the special effects, acting and camerawork make the whole affair feel dangerously close to B-movie territory. Milla Jovovich is as good as she's ever been, but Luther, Albert, and Leon's characters are so stiff and one-dimensional that it really wouldn't have made any difference for me if they lived or died. Everything is over the top in the worst way, dislodging any sense of tension and excitement I felt with moments so ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh.<br /><br />I will admit, though, that I still enjoyed Retribution to an extent. While that enjoyment was more primarily based in seeing old faces return (such as Michelle Rodriguez's dual role and the Red Queen's comeback), if you've seen all the other Resident Evil movies up until now, you may as well give Retribution a whirl. Otherwise, you're better off going back and watching the first few entries and leaving it at that.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|just get ok........ok just get it<br />it will change your life like facebook covers and profiles are no problem with this app its just like instagram but for the kindle fire only!!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|What's there to say I just like Phillip Phillips style, can't wait for his next album.  I would buy again.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Voyager keeps my attention because of the relationships between the crew members. Also, I like the idea of a woman in strong role.
B00332CWLW|3.0|For me, this book contained a number of interesting smaller stories cleverly linked by the  spectacle of Phillipe Petit's high wire walk between the twin towers back in the 1970s. Early on in the book I wasn't too sure where the story was going . . . it seemed a bit disjointed at times . . as if the author was making it up as he wrote without having a definite beginning,middle or end in mind.<br /><br />Nevertheless some of the characters were very well drawn and overall it was worth the read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I love Sheryl Sandberg, and the authenticity of her voice in this book.  Never mind that she and I are the same age (1987 high school grads...holla!).  She seems like some kind of gentle, yet pep-talking sage with the wisdom of a thousand years.  I wish I had had the epiphanies that she's had as she's traveled her life journey, instead of having to read her words, light years behind her in the process of leaning in to life and career and ambition, and realizing that I felt some of the same things she writes about in my 20s (finding the right man is NEVER worth sacrificing potentially life-changing experiences and opportunities) and in my 30s (NO.  You really CAN'T have it all), and I ignored my inner voice.  I am grateful for this book and the conversations that it's stimulating on so many levels.  Bravo, Sheryl.  Bravo!
B003BFTS9K|4.0|Used it several times while hiking. Works the way it says it does and the it does not unscrew when while in use.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I love facebook be cause it allows me to be able to stay in contact with my family and friends.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This book is comprised of several short stories, witty and although it's great to dip into this celebrities personal experiences, I just didn't feel satisfied.  I actually can't bring myself to read the entire thing.  I'm 3/4 through and just not interested enough to continue.  Normally at this point with any other book, I think I'd be racing to end.
B000FA675C|4.0|I have learned a few things as I went through this book. Keeps your attention. Not too convoluted. nice reading.
B001TH16DI|4.0|As I had not gotten around to buying these on DVD, when Amazon had the Blu-rays on sale, I just could not pass it up.<br /><br />Watching these with my son has been a great introduction to older production movies, as pretty much every movie he has seen to date uses all of the new flashy CGI style enhancements, so explaining to him that when Khan puts the parasite into the crew members ears, that is what Special Effects were like back then.<br /><br />The quality has been exceptional.
B002M5E2DW|2.0|From the time I was a child, I heard comments related to successful and unsuccessful people.  The word attitude was alway in there somewhere.  Although The Secret is about the law of attraction, the ability to attract is mainly dependent on attitude. The late Earl Nightingale used to state that we become what we think about.  The power of positive thinking, asking solution-oriented questions, and reaping what we sow are acknowledged by all self-help approaches.<br /><br />So, what's missing from this book?  A HUGE emphasis focused about taking action.  We'll never get one thing just by wishing.  No farmer ever sits by his fields and wishes for a crop.  He cultivates, sows, cultivates, waters, weeds, etc.  The same is true of life.  Stephen Covey referred to this as the law of the farm.  It's a law.  It's physics.. not pseudo quantum physics.<br /><br />The author simply and cleverly took the content of past books like Think & Grow Rich, repackaged the ideas with new-age art and terminology, and made herself a fortune.<br /><br />This is a great feel good book.... but then a real downer if you don't go out and plant, cultivate, etc.  If everyone could have everything they wanted by wishing to their Genie, not a single person would work one day in a job they didn't love.<br /><br />The author and speakers, especially those like Joe Vitale who have marketed themselves millions on this kind of feel-good fluff, are making a fortune on this stuff.  Why?  Because it sounds too good to be true.<br /><br />Read and be encouraged.  Just, don't mistake thinking positive for having a magic lamp.  After all, it was a fairy tale, not something to put one's faith in.
B009R659L8|5.0|i started reading and had to finish it could not put it down, her writing is great and cant wait for more of her books, so far i have read them all<br />brenda leppert<br />east dubuque, illinois

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The series characters become gripping in their story from Lord and Lady Gratham to the relationships between the domestic help. Their lives are interwoven all within Downton Abbey. Everyone has an investment in it and all who live there. I can't wait for season four to be released.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Great figure! A nice size and looks great on my shelf! I would recommend it to Deadpool fans! Great buy!

B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I saw this in  the theater, and as soon as it came on DVD i snatched it up!  A new take on the meaning of silent film... takes the viewer on a mind trip through deep and rich  cultures of our time, from the beautiful & exotic, to bizarre, the eyes are constantly riveted!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Very good quality product for a good deal. Heavy duty insulation and tight fitting connections. Gold plated on the male end. Works perfectly.
B000002I97|5.0|Did not know about this great singer until I heard him on IMUS IN THE MORNING and was just a joy  to listen to.  The entire album is great and a good singer to just mellow out with.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit is funny at the start, then gets down to the drama.  I really enjoyed this film, but maybe 3 in the trilogy could be 1 too many.  Time will tell.

0812993845|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella books (favorites are Remember Me?, Can You Keep a Secret? and I've Got Your Number) but this one was not as stellar as the above listed.  Lacked characters that I really wanted to know what happened and found it frustrating at points.  Worth a read, but others are better.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Love the cd and the man.  Glad he continues to overwhelm us fans with great music and enjoyment.  Keep going Mr. Clapton.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|This is the greatest of them since I was young and it never failed to make me go back into my teen years jumping around the living room to the music.  The flute throws you into in the days when you would be just do that yourself.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The end of the book reminded me of the end of the seventh Harry Potter book.  Seemed way too abrupt.  The imagery was great and I enjoyed the plot...but I was very disappointed that there wasn't a better resolution.  Maybe I just hoped for too much.
0307279189|4.0|Well written, informative, and entertaining. i would recommend this book to any runners or anyone thinking about taking up running.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We were so addicted to this show after watching seasons 1 & 2 that we paid to see all of season 3 in just over a week!  Wonderful show, great actors & writing, and always keeps you watching for more!  Can't wait for Season 4 to start!

B00B69UQEO|1.0|i have been a huge fan of DM for a long time and have loved almost everything they have ever released. even if it was'nt my fave at the time, with a little listening to have grown to enjoy. NOT THIS. i purchased the deluxe version with the extra tracks, have tried listening to to it repeatedly and have to say WHAT HAPPENED. I have not found a thing enjoyable about this album. i've already given it away. it made me question if i will buy any new material from them again. what they had has gone. i'm sad.
0385040253|5.0|Ashley clearly knew his knots and presents them beautifully in this engaging, deeply personal, and easy-to-navigate tome. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the history or use of knots.
0307352153|2.0|My other half has been reading this and constantly giving me nuggets of information about introverts, because he believes I am an introvert and he patronizingly wants to tell me it's OK.<br /><br />Firstly, I don't believe I am an introvert.  I have a ton of friends and I always had since I was a girl.<br /><br />Secondly, I resentthe whole tone of people's response to this book.  It's saying \\"being an introvert is inferior, OK, but we've just read this new book and we've found you might not be so worthless after all.\\"<br /><br />I am sure there's a whole lot more to it than that, but that's the message everyone is taking from it. Not everyone is the same!  Deal with it.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cannot begin to express how much I appreciate the genuine, authentic, and straight forward narrative that is HOPELESS. Sky is a home school, technology deprived, adopted 17 yr old. She doesn't remember any time before she was adopted at 6. now, she has a revolving door of hook up that are meaningless; she feels nothing. No boy has ever ignited any sort of passion in her. Until she meets Dean Holder. The spark from the beginning, but Sky is leery of his intensity. As their relationship heats up, she shuts down physically and emotionally. She then realizes she knew Holder before...in the years she can't remember before 6.<br /><br />The book is fast from there and written so honestly, it begs one to think about the research needed to get it spot on...cause Mrs. Hoover addresses all the pain, hurt, and love needed to make it to believe in Hope again. This is an amazing, heart breaking journey. And as a survivor myself, true to form.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great times this collection holds. Movies are good I like movies a lot. Magic is real and it surrounds us every day.

B007KCG7MQ|3.0|I've liked Joe for decades and always appreciated his good licks and sardonic lyrics. This album has some good tracks, but also some that are dreadful. He said in an interview that he had some things to say, but to me the lyrics are often insipid and the music uninspired. I tried to listen but could not make it all the way through. To remain relevant he needs to live in the past because there is not much here in the present to build upon.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm just in love with hidden search games. this one is very interactive and makes you use your brain thumbs up.
B00007KWHN|4.0|Used to listen to it as teenager, forgot about it for 30 years, and have rediscovered it again. A really solid album, maybe their best before they descended into excessive rambling with no apparent point.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Now I went in to the movie pretty much just wanting to see yummy men strut in on stage and even that did not make up for this movie.  Story line was poor at best and dragged on.  I almost walked away from my rented movie but I stuck it out just so I could see if the ending was something spectacular but nope.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Much much better then the VHS version.  One of my favorite movies  I wish they would convert more of the older musicals to blu ray!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|You know, I'd sort of passively avoided this movie for awhile and was pleasantly surprised by it.  Several fantastic performances - definitely worth watching.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Over the years since its release, I have watched this movie a number of times - each has taught me something new and insightful in the path of non-violence in civil protest.  I have not yet reached that level of commitment - but each viewing provides more motivation to exert more effort in learning and practicing non-violence.  I believe and know that such is the proper path ... just difficult to accept and practice.

B00CNZUI6Q|4.0|Rod Stewart has still got it.  He has always been a great singer with a uniquely brilliant voice and the skill and musicality to put a song over with real feeling, but some of his choice of material and production style has often made me wonder whether any of the old magic was still there.  In places on this album it certainly is.  It's variable material, but the good bits are really good.<br /><br />The album opens with a decent but pretty standard pop song, She Makes Me Happy which Rod lifts a bit above the ordinary, and in It's Over it's good to see that he has the dignity to sing about the end of a marriage rather than teenage heartbreak, but he shows that his real greatness is still there in Brighton Beach, a beautiful, deeply evocative song about the recall of first love.  It may not be the enduring masterpiece that I Don't Want To Talk About It is, for example, but it affects me nearly as deeply.<br /><br />I won't go through the entire album - there's a good variety of pop, dance and ballads most written by Stewart himself and often reflecting on ageing and times past.  Some bits are pretty ordinary, some are very good. I think the three bonus tracks are among the best here, by the way.  They're a little more bluesy and a little less produced which gives them a genuineness which I like a lot, and I think they're well worth the extra couple of quid.<br /><br />The thing that strikes me most strongly is that Rod sounds sincere throughout, probably because he's mainly singing his own songs.  He never sounds as though he's going through the motions and even in the places where the production is a bit schmaltzy (which is too often for me, I must say), or the parts when material isn't great, the band sounds fairly ordinary or the lyrics are a bit naff, he sings as though he really means it and manages to lift the whole thing well above the average.<br /><br />Rod Stewart has made some albums which I think would fall into the UN classification of Cruel And Unusual Punishment, so it's good to see that a truly great singer can still make a good record.  It certainly isn't up there with Every Picture Tells A Story, but it's not bad at all and has moments of brilliance.  Recommended.Punishment, so it's good to see that a truly great singer can still make a good record.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is tops!  Once again Michael Connelly proves what a great story teller he is.  Not only are the details correct, but he does it so you can't put the book down.
B007SPN5MA|3.0|I caught the segment on Glen Hansard on my favorite Sunday morning program - the musical clips that they used were fantastic - so I ordered the album - but the rest of the record wasn't as good. Ireland has amazing local musicians - I have been there many times - Davy Watson in Belfast - and singer/songwriter Kyle Suckling is one of the best I have ever heard anywhere - I was hoping that this record would be as good as the other Irish locals - but it really wasn't. Bummer. I listened to it once and then set it aside.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|For the amount of talent we were expecting more. Cute but really not much here. There are better road movies to watch
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|**SPOILERS  ...probably**<br /><br />Judging from many of the other reviews, I guess you're only going to enjoy The Grey as much as your 'let-precise/accurate-physics-rest-for-a-while-and-just-enjoy-the-show' meter will allow (like an 80's movie where people just let a little imagination fill in the gaps and moved on). Expect nothing going in and just observe where it goes. It definitely gets there.<br /><br />To me, The Grey feels like a philosophical kick in the balls that didn't, doesn't, and most likely won't apologize. If you're of a religious nature, you may find it somewhat offensive (Neeson pretty much bypasses all bs and puts God on the spot), but it realistically/indifferently approaches a subject that many people would LIKE to think positively about.<br /><br />Neeson comes off to me as an 'optimistic cynic' who choses to advance onward in spite of his less than kind surrounding and situation (this actually makes for fascinating chemistry between him and the group's human antagonist who shares some of his views). While a few in the group try to place some special significance on their survival (which mother nature and misfortune work hand in hand to counter) Neeson weathers it all and keeps them going. Things don't improve (at all) but the 'if ya want something done right, do it yourself' mentality Neeson displays made me wanna cheer him on til the end.<br /><br />Like I said, don't expect anything and just see where it goes. *spoilers- if you can really appreciate the significance of the poem Lian speaks of, then it really doesn't matter WHAT happens to him in the end (though the last scene after the credits may make you smile an evil smile.) ^_~
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book, couldn't put it down!  I am sad that the series is ending.  I want more stories.<br />  The end.
0062220837|1.0|I bought this for my 11 year old because amazon markets it as book for kids. Page 26-27 contain a graphic depiction of sex between a young boy and a girl faerie. I am not ok with this being marketed to kids.
B004J0PUP2|5.0|Just a brilliant movie! enjoyable even after all of these years later.  It asks me for 8 more words so I can submit....
0061186473|1.0|The second story in this book \\"Trollbridge\\" contains a graphic description of a troll's penis and another scene where the troll 'lowered himself on to the boy'. Maybe the author didn't realize how this would read to a child. The published should not be marketing this as book 'for younger readers'.
B00BHO7M5O|5.0|This is probably the most polarizing Evangelion output since the last two episodes that forced director Hideaki Anno to create The End of Evangelion. 14 years after 2.22 and the changes are jarring. The audience almost feels like Shinji, confused and troubled about basically destroying the world. And with 3.33, the bodies only stack up even more. It's dark and strange and alot of people were disappointed. Personally, it's my favorite Evangelion feature yet, and that's saying alot considering how much I love EoE and 2.22. A lot of people seemed to be confused: The Rebuild movies are NOT remakes. With 1.11, things start off pretty much exactly how they do in the original NGE series but by the time we get to 2.22, we began to see the diversions. It's almost like a different world but with a constant twinge of dreadful nostalgia. Some have even theorized that after Shinji rejects Human Instrumentality in EoE, he gives the world another chance to emerge from the LCL, the primoridial soup, and start over. And that's where 1.11 begins. This theory opens up even more questions but it also would explain why there are similarities as well as vast differences. It would also explain the subtitles of each Rebuild movie. You Are (Not) Alone, You Can (Not) Advance, You Can (Not) Redo. The \\"(Not)\\"'s represent options for differences but also indicate the inevitability of some events. I hope I haven't caused more confusion. Anyway, 3.33 is a truly brave dive into the future and, whether people like it or not, it's pushed the envelope as far as anime goes. It casts a huge shadow and I hope 4.44 is just as amazing.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This may be a book about teenagers but it was truly an \\"inspiring\\" look at how short our lives can be and how two young kids can teach us adults about love and overcoming adversity! I loved how poetry was so much a part of this book and shows the present generation that expression through words is not a lost art rather an extension of our daily lives! Can't wait to read the next book in the series! The book makes you cry, laugh and gives you hope that with time all things settle and have a greater purpose. A must read!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was very well written. I loved the characters. It made me smile, cry, get on the edge of my seat, and sigh with relief. It was so good i didn't want the story to end! What a great twist at the end.

I do wonder if all of the military/cyber information<br />Is true.  Waiting for the next one!!!
B0077ATSZE|5.0|I cannot imagine anyone actually watching this film in a movie theater, surrounded by strangers.  I actually had to STOP the DVD several times during my first watching...I was THAT moved.  Not just a little &#34;Notebook&#34; tear here and there, I am talking SOBBING.  In other words, bring tissues.  Lots of them.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is my ultimate favorite author. There isn't a book she has written I haven't enjoyed. Daddy's Gone A Hunting is just another one of a long list of superb novels she has written. Again, I was sitting on the edge of my seat and eyes clued to every word in the story. The characters she writes about are always of great interest to me.<br /><br />I'm always so very disappointed when I've finished reading because I realize I have to wait for her next novel to be written and released. Her books can't come to the public fast enough in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you Mary Higgins Clark for making reading a joy!

1451627289|4.0|First Line: I have never been what you'd call a crying man.<br /><br />That's what high school English teacher Jake Epping will tell you, if you were to ask. But while grading essays, he's blown away by what GED student and janitor Harry Dunning has written. Somehow, some way, fifty years ago Harry survived his father's sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is still thinking how life can turn on a dime when he learns of an even more bizarre secret: Al, owner of the local diner and Jake's friend, wants Jake to take over his obsession. Many years ago Al discovered a time portal in the diner's storeroom, and he's been trying ever since to prevent the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.<br /><br />Jake allows himself to be persuaded, and when he steps through the portal, he finds himself in the era of Elvis, cheap gasoline, and almost universal cigarette smoking. Jake has plenty of time to start a new life in small town Texas, but each day draws him nearer to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. Will he be able to accomplish what Al tried and failed to do? And if he does stop the assassination of the president, what sort of consequences will there be?<br /><br />I have to admit that I held off reading this book for a long time. I was in third grade when JFK was assassinated. Yes, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I first heard the news. For reasons that don't need to go into a book review, this event hit my mother and I hard, and I was reluctant to rip the Band-aid off that particular wound, even if it had healed long ago.<br /><br />I should not have worried, and I should not have waited. This book has very little to do with JFK and everything to do with Jake Epping. Stephen King's main character takes us all on a nostalgic yet honest journey through America during the end of the Eisenhower administration. Everything is brought to life in vivid and loving detail. I enjoyed reliving the era of my childhood, but as I read, I found myself thinking more about recent American history, its might-have-beens... and about love.<br /><br />Few writers can immerse me in their fictional worlds so completely as does Stephen King. No matter how strange, King creates characters and backdrops that are familiar and that I can trust-- which is a very good thing because I need someone/something trustworthy at my back while I'm reading to figure out how to escape his weirdness!<br /><br />If you've been postponing reading this book for the same reasons I did, you can stop. When you read 11-22-63, you're going to read a lot more about love than you will about bullets and lone gunmen.I read, I found myself thinking more about recent American history, its might-have-beens... and about love.<br /><br />Few writers can immerse me in their fictional worlds so completely as does Stephen King.

B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I've been listening to this album in my car pretty much nonstop for the past two months. I have most of Soilwork's albums, this is definitely my favorite. Every track is awesome, and even after a few months of listening there is nothing in this album that I am bored of or want to skip. Particularly good in my opinion is Long Live the Misanthrope; the way that guitar solo ends is ruthless. I'm kinda surpsied that I haven't any traffic tickets because I think I go about 85 on the freeway when I'm listening to this album. It's extremely well written, creative and powerful. And if you get a chance to see these guys live, drop whatever plans you have and go do that!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I enjoy having the kindle app on my Samsung Galaxy III.  If I can't or don't have my kindle with me, I always have my cellphone.  The two drawbacks compared to using the actual kindle are<br /><br />1.battery time - my cellphone eats battery time regardless of how I'm using it, so I may or may not have enough battery left and don't want to risk using up my remaining battery if it will be awhile before I can recharge my phone. My actual kindle can run many hours without recharge.<br /><br />2. small screen size on the phone.<br /><br />Neither of those things have anything to do with the kindle app itself, it works great on the cellphone.  I was pleasantly surprised about how well it worked, and really wasn't any new learning curve compared to using it on the kindle.
B0035W8QUQ|5.0|Very high level playing & beautiful interpretation!  I would reccomend this to all interested in early music. I hope they come out with more albums soon!

B0077ATSSQ|4.0|I am a movie collector.  Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks are some of my favs.  This copy I purchased came to me in great shape and on time.  The Seller was one of the best.  The movie is a tear jerker but anyone who lived and remembers 9/11 is sure to appreciate the story and will understand the pain and heartfelt movie that this became.
B00AEJVXC6|5.0|I've got a CD collection numbering over 1200 and I've been trying to get it all ripped to my media server so that it's accessible everywhere in the house. I'm using DBPoweramp to rip to FLAC as I'm a bit of an audiophile and I want accurate backups of all of my music for when the CDs get scratched or finally degrade.<br />The first pass I made with an LG DVD-ROM and there were about 70 discs that couldn't be ripped accurately due to scratches, etc. That drive recently died so I started looking for something that was better at ripping.<br />I came across Plextor drives in my online research which brought me to this drive and I couldn't be happier. I've tried re-ripping 30 of the \\"error\\" discs thus far and it's been able to handle all but two (which are fairly obviously damaged; although some it was able to handle were as well). This is double the price of most DVD-ROMs but if you're trying to get accurate, high-quality rips, Plextor looks to be the way to go.

0312611692|3.0|This author put a lot of material in one single book. That alone deserve great credits. In addition, he developed an index and explain how he came up with this index. This should be a good example for any social science students. It is the method and the way he explained his index that deserve more credit than the index itself.<br /><br />Other than that, I do not see much insight.<br /><br />I do tend to buy into the theory that location matter a lot, I have a hard time to believe that modern science was just around the corner in Song China. Even Zheng He did manage to stumble upon America and immigrates from Asia to the new continent decided to break away from Old east, I do not see how it will help old east to start industrial revolution.<br /><br />The notion of \\"the advantage of being backwardness\\" is confusing. If being backward always garanteed of being advantagous, why cannot an advanced society smash everything and intentionally make itself being backward and thus having advantage. Doesn't this remind us \\"the broken window\\" fallacy in economics?<br /><br />The use of this notion could be derived from a historical pattern that in ancient times when agriculture based economy can not resist more primitive nomad's invasion and fall apart, a pattern repeatly occured in both the West and the East. Thus, the backwardness of nomad did have some advantage. However, that advantage only exist when those nomadic people have an overpowerful brutal violence and more importantly, had not visible conscious not to use the violence.<br /><br />This advantage of brutal force does not exist anymore in industrial age. In today's world, I do not see in any way that a backward country could have an upper hand in term of violence, or military might.

B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I ordered &#34;Beautiful Creatures&#34; on my Kindle yesterday because I didn't have a chance to see it at the movies and the trailer for it looked amazing.  I was excited that it doesn't come out until May 12th, but I was able to purchase a digital copy almost two weeks before the release date (Amazon offered it as a digital early release).  I downloaded it to my Kindle and watched the first half, and was going to finish it this morning since it was quite late.  Last night it played fine, and I decided to watch the second half streaming on my PC.  There was a disclaimer that because of copyright infringement it couldn't be streamed, and needed to be downloaded.  No problem since i had already downloaded it.  I turned my Kindle Fire on and went to watch it.  I had several error messages including that the player needed to be reinstalled, the WiFi wasn't connected, etc.  I checked several other movies that I have purchased and they all played fine.  When I long-pressed on &#34;Beautiful Creatures&#34; it took me back to my home page and didn't have the options of deleting it and re downloading it.  I went back to the video store to see if I could download it again from there for free, and it isn't in the video store anymore, at least not that I could find.<br /><br />I was excited about being able to see it early as a pre-release, but if Amazon is going to charge the regular price of $14.99 as a purchase for a digital copy they should make sure it is going to work.  I'll continue to buy digital movies, but probably not another pre-release since it seems like there are too many glitches and I just paid $15 for a movie that I can't even watch.  Luckily I have Netflix if Amazon can't get the issue fixed.

B0002VF4XU|5.0|To watch it for the first time is to be surprised, to watch it more than once is to make discoveries. The original shock is gone--these days nothing shocks us. But the scope is ever amazing.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Its totally worth the dollar spent on it. It is the second most addicting kindle game (Right after the Infinite Black. my User:Liljaney)<br />This game is horribly addicting, in a creepy way. It really makes you develop a strategic take-over-the-world offensive, and its so addicting that you can play it for hours at a time

His sharp, blunt prose appealed to me and I liked the flow of the story, that of Henry Chinaski's childhood/teen years of beatings (receiving them from his father and others, giving them to friends and schoolmates), severe acne, awkward relationships, drinking, masturbation, and general struggle to do just about anything other than read and write.<br /><br />I loved the observations/realizations interspersed throughout the story as Chinaski comes of age (the entire novel is 1st person narration by Chinaski's character), including, to list a few:<br /><br />&#34;So, that's what they wanted: lies. Beautiful lies. That's what they needed. People were fools.&#34; (p. 84)<br /><br />&#34;A . . . nation of [expletive]s driving automobiles, eating, having babies, doing everything the worst way possible, like voting for the presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.&#34; (p. 174)<br /><br />&#34;Get a man who works for nothing and you get a man who just likes to hang around.&#34; (p. 182)<br /><br />I won't analyze the quotes above in detail, but clearly the first two take a negative slant on people in general, while the third suggests to me that Chinaski believes people should be paid for their work or else not work at all, or at least that unpaid workers do not make good ones.<br /><br />I might've given this book five stars (because I enjoyed reading it so much and, as per above, liked Bukowski's style and flow and his protagonist's many tidbits of purported wisdom) if some of Chinaski's hatred of all things American could've been substituted for (or at least supplemented by) an understanding of how the American family unit affects children and drives the good and the bad of capitalism. Perhaps this is unfair of me and I'm projecting my own ideas about families, children, and capitalism onto Chinaski, but as I read I just felt like Chinaski, for all of his problems and faults, was so intelligent that by the end of the book he could've understood the people around him a bit better and understood why he came to feel the way he felt. Seemed to me like he separated everyone into two categories: rich and poor, the rich being shallow and happy, the poor being deep and miserable, and his answer to most things was to drink extreme amounts, fight, and to find respite only in reading and writing. Near the book's end he thinks of suicide and taking &#34;eight, or ten or twenty of them with [him]. . . .&#34; (p. 274); I suppose I wanted to see him grow as a person, but other than his assumed commitment to becoming a writer, it's not there.<br /><br />I intend to read more of Bukowski's novels and I know he uses Chinaski in others, so I'm curious to see how my thoughts on Chinaski may or may not change upon future reading.elligent that by the end of the book he could've understood the people around him a bit better and understood why he came to feel the way he felt.

B0083Z614S|3.0|My wife chose this book however I still found it good reading, I have nothing further to say about it
1451613512|2.0|Was forced to borrow this book for a weekend... A marxists revisionists book of history. If only the dark side of the story is looked at, then only half the story is revealed. I knew better to give stone the time of day. Throw this in the fire with the Bolshevik constitution and communist manifesto. America is God's country, but is still human, not evil.
0345803485|5.0|This book is definitely no \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" as in, it is not written so eccentrically (vocabulary and all), but for the 21st century it is definitely a good read. It is very true what most are saying, \\"You either love the book, or you hate it.\\" Because it is meant for readers of the 21st century, it is hard to adapt to the simplistic style of writing, as well as the repetitiveness.<br />It is not strictly a \\"porno-novel,\\" as some would have it, but a story. It is that of itself, a story. What a world we live in, to say the least, to compare it to the famous \\"Harry Potter\\" in sales.<br />If one does not like it, it is mostly for 3 reasons.<br />1. They are of a prude nature, and this novel doesn't skip a beat in provocative detail.<br />2. They are used to a more mature writing style and/or old at heart.<br />3. It does have a \\"teeny bopper\\" demeanor, which can throw people of guard, and put them off to the book all together.<br />All in all, love or hate, this book is a must read!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!, will totally recommend it to others. Love the storyline, the characters, the music spooky and awesome
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Tom Cruise (in the movie) could not possibly do Jack Reacher.  The book was fast moving and very entertaining for story line and action -
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an amazing game and very realistic. This is because The 3D graphics on the game make it this way. Train surfers is also addictive so once you start you can't stop.
1401322786|3.0|The follow-up to Alexandra Monir's TIMELESS, TIMEKEEPER raises the stakes of time travel beyond what Michele Windsor had ever anticipated.<br /><br />In TIMELESS, Michele Windsor was forced to move from California to Manhattan to live with the grandparents with whom her mother had cut contact after they had offered her then boyfriend (and Michele's father) a whole lot of money to leave and never return. Needless to say, they had a complicated relationship --- especially when Michele's father disappeared soon after the offer. Nevertheless, when Michele's mom dies, she must go and live at her grandparent's large mansion in Manhattan. Once there, she realizes she has the power to time travel and finally meets the boy she had been dreaming about her entire life...the only problem is that she falls in love with someone who lives in the year 1910.<br /><br />Now, in TIMEKEEPER, we meet Michele in the present again. She's given up on ever being able to be in a real relationship with Philip Walker...or at least, she's trying. That is, until he walks into her high school and sits down in her class. But he doesn't have any idea who she is. Michele knows it must be him though --- she would never mistake those piercing blue eyes --- especially because their shared passion for music is the same as it was in 1910. She just needs to remind him of the music they created together --- literally, they produced two songs that became hits when Michele passed them on to her celebrity great-grandmother in the 1920's.<br /><br />Trying to convince her time-traveling boyfriend that they are in love isn't the only problem that Michele faces. Apparently, a distant Windsor relative of hers is furious with the fact she exists at all and is determined to put an end to her life. Michele must travel back in time once again to solve the mystery of her father's dealings with the powerful Time Society (whose rules he immediately broke by staying long enough to date Michele's mother and then by havinga time-crossed child) and plot to vanquish Rebecca Windsor on multiple layers of time, all before she exacts her revenge on Michele.<br /><br />While it is necessary to read TIMELESS before reading its follow-up, TIMEKEEPER takes a distinct shift. While the first book was a romance wrapped up in time travel, this book contains much more urgency as the mystery of exactly how Michele is able to time travel emerges. Alexandra Monir intersperces excerpts from the Handbook of the Time Society, Irving Henry's diary and accounts from Millicent August (the founder of the Time Society) between chapters, giving this novel a larger context for its time travel while still providing a variety of great historical fiction backdrops.<br /><br />Reviewed by Liz Kossnar

B007N8RULO|5.0|So much time used playing this game. Very easy to use .<br />All the children found it fun and easy to use.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a really good game with high speed action and constant dodging. Overall this a great game for any iron man fan.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've read all of the books. And, the series is beyond my wildest imagination. Kudos to HBO for the excellent job they did in bring it to life.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Would have loved it more had I not seen Downtown Abbey, but great setting and costumes.  Love this type of entertainment.
B00008FEC2|4.0|Good movie, although the ending leaves a bit to be desired - I don't want to give away the ending to someone who has never seen the movie, so I won't explain....The VHS tape I bought was used and probably pretty old, the picture and sound quality are not that great but that was OK since I didn't want to spend much money.
159420411X|4.0|Very interesting with fascinating explanations of statistical problems.  Reads like a text book, not an easy read but still many amusing examples.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|It fits the phone perfectly and offers a great rubberized grip.  No need to buy the brand name - stick with Amazon Basics.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I don't usually read Stephen King but loved just about everything this book had to offer. It had just the right amount of sci fi and reality to make it believable.<br /><br />I would have given it a 5 star but I felt some of the stuff in the middle was a little long winded and I would forget who some of the previous characters were. Since all the characters were important several times I had to go back to refresh my memory. The last couple hundred pages was very much worth the wait!<br /><br /> A fun read!
B009FZFONO|4.0|Sometimes you wonder how many zombie killings you can watch... But this show always keeps you coming back for more. The interaction between the characters is sometimes captivating. You just want to know what happens next.
B007SGM084|2.0|Writing is amateurish, titillating is the only descriptive I can give. I won't bother reading any other books in this trilogy.
0071762345|5.0|The best part about the book is the case studies and examples. Many of my clients are small companies who are trying to use social media in their marketing. Dave Kerpen gave plenty of examples of small to enterprise level companies who used social media and what the result was (SUCCESS!). I have used his book in many of my classes / workshops to let people know that if they are getting started on Facebook, read this first. Dave Kerpen ends by saying to contact him via Twitter or Facebook. I did and he responded within 30 minutes. Thanks Dave!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really loved this whole series. It's one of those &#34;can't put down books&#34;. I sat for hours reading it and would definitely read it again.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love the violin. So to have an artist play the violin in new and interesting ways was a no-brainer for me. I'll admit, this album is not for everyone, but it's worth a shot if you like violin music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to read the third book! Kept me interested and<br /> on my toes throughout.  Give it a chance, you win the disappointed!
0385349947|5.0|This is an amazing book, and I recommend it for anyone --- male and female -- who is working in the business world today.  Books of old used to be titled something like, \\"How to succeed in a man's world,\\" etc.  No longer relevant.  Women are now in leadership positions.  This book goes far to explain the DIFFERENCES in men and women, the pitfalls, the benefits, etc.  It is NOT a \\"women's empowerment\\" book, or a book that begs for \\"equality\\".  It is a common sens approach from a woman who made it to the top -- she has more credibility than any women's study professor or NOW member.  She worked hard to get where she was -- and she doesn't complain about it being harder as a female.  She just explains what was different.<br /><br />Men should read this for insight on women; on why women peers, subordinates, and seniors \\"think\\" differently, and women should read it to understand that being a woman doesn't entitle you to special treatment -- you still have to succeed on your own, but the book helps highlight some mistakes you might make because of gender -- and maybe a woman can learn from those who have gone before.<br /><br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, especially graduates from college.  MEN AND women.  Men will be working for women -- best to get a head start on it learn how its different.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Any disco fan would love this collection from the Queen herself.  All her classics are here to enjoy. The newer material is less effective; but the bonus extended version dance tracks are very good (great for working out).
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Good set of the first 6 movies with the original cast....If you can make it past the first movie which was so lame I could barely stay awake.  However, starting with movie #2 (Wrath of Kahn) the story picks up, the action picks up and the tempo increases with each movie after that.  My favorite was #4 when they came back to earth through time (in a Klingon ship) and landed in Golden Gate park in the 1970's.  Good humor there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really loved this whole series. It's one of those &#34;can't put down books&#34;. I sat for hours reading it and would definitely read it again.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|There's a reason it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's a great movie of a historically meaningful event. A must watch for history buffs and/or thriller fans.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|I put it on 1080p in video mode just to try it out and now the app crashes every time I press make video. I can't even change it back to the way it was before.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|I loved this band growing up! It was really cool reading about the meanings behind the songs and albums. Such a cool way to learn about the band and each guy on an individual level. Just a fun, enjoyable read!
B0080SSYUW|5.0|John Grisham is always entertaining. I'm not into litigation scenes, but I liked the variety in this book, his first collection of short stories. (7)
B005DOL0R0|3.0|It's fine as a carrying case.  I had expected asturdier  fold-out stand as part of the case. It is serving the purpose quite well, however.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really loved this whole series. It's one of those &#34;can't put down books&#34;. I sat for hours reading it and would definitely read it again.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a good album in my opinion. Unique blending of musical styles with powerful lyrics that you'll want to sing again and again.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|great book. so happy this series got picked up and cared for by a true fan after Jordan passed. this is the epic ending this story deserved.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|great inspiring movie really touching people's hearts while bringing honest laugh and smiles on people's faces watch it for great inspiration and delight
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Full Disclosure:<br />DM is my FAVORITE BAND. PERIOD.<br /><br />That being said, the first couple of listenings of the last 5 CDs have left me unimpressed.  BUT, the 4th-100th listenings have ALL been inspiring!!!  These guys have an amazing knack of really deep and insightful music that sounds to the casual listener like simple alternative rock music.  IT IS NOT SIMPLE, I assure you!<br /><br />If you try to judge DM on the 1st or 2nd listen, you do them and yourself an injustice.<br /><br />The sounds are intricate, insightful, soulful and powerful.
1577314808|5.0|A MUST FOR THE SERIOUS SEEKER,  HIS ADVICE ON STOPPING MIND CHATTER IS INVALUABLE.  HIS UNDERSTANDING IS INSPIRING AND WORKS!  SOME BOOKS ARE TOO SHALLOW AND SOME TAKE A GREAT AMOUNT OF STUDY BEFORE THE READER UNDERSTANDS THE SUBJECT.  ANYONE CAN GET SOMETHING FROM THIS ON THE FIRST READING.
B001YXZL7E|5.0|being a fan of the movie i had to download the soundtrack cant believe it took me this long to get around to it
0783231202|5.0|A great movie about a forgotten yet powerful moment in our nation's early history! All the actors portrayed their respective historical characters flawlessly and with impressionable emotion and conviction. This movie does not shy away from showing the brutality that slaves where shown in the slave trade, even in America, so best not watch with young children. Nevertheless, a inspirational reminder of how far we have come as a people nearly 200 years ago.
B000U0O9FM|3.0|I enjoyed this book mostly due to the writing style which kept the book interesting and fast  paced. I enjoyed the way that everything made sense at the end. I was very satisfied and would recommend it to anyone mature enough to handle it.
B003CN5SAY|3.0|regular shipping time,  product as stated, great show
B001DE29SS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. at his best. You will love the story of the great Chaplin from start to finish. Must see
0452289963|5.0|i WOULD RECOMMEND ALL THESE BOOKS TO ANYONE BEGINNING A SEARCH INTO CONSCIOUSNESS.  BILLY FINGERS IS LIGHTER READING BUT QUITE ENTERTAINING.
B001TVNU4C|5.0|being a kid of the 80's i have been wanting to add to my 80's playlist and looking for the best box set to include. how could you leave out The King of Pop
B0000EMYC1|5.0|This is a great deal! A Beautiful Mind and the Emperor's Club are great movies that deal with people overcoming tragic moments in life, coming out of them for the better. A must have if you love dramas!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book seemed disjointed, some parts painting painful detail and at climax moment skipping ahead.  While a good book, not as good as the first two.  Could have been much more suspenseful in places
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun game but I'm kind of mad it started me back at the beginning oh well more fun and chances to do things different overall a fun game
B0035O66CO|5.0|A classic from the nineteen sixties. The main stars work very well together. You will love the time period of 1933
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This is a good book, she is not saying anythis earth shattering and I do not agree with all her recommendations. But it is an honest assessment.
B004UID2LC|5.0|At first I was skeptical about his app. But after seeing someone use I downloaded it. I works tremendous and I get to listen to all my favorite songs for free!!!!!!!!!! there is no doubt in my mind that anyone who like to listen to music will want this app!
B005LAII8K|5.0|I saw this movie when it was in theaters and when I left, I knew I was going to buy this as soon as it came out in Blu-ray. I recommend this for anyone that enjoys Sci-fi and wants a something new to watch.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Hey for a gameloft game this is awesome<br />This looks amazing and the graphics damn its good<br />stay awesome bros *brofist*
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|i wish it had more roaming instead of just flying in a straight line and now I just have to talk to fill up the requiered word count haha
B000AP04NI|5.0|One of the great classics of the nineteen fifties. All the songs are a hit. Great dance numbers for all.
B008602KQI|3.0|Read the book before watching the movie. It was an ok read, much better that the moview of course. Just ok, because there were too many things thrown in at once.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is an amazing game!!!!!!!It is like an iron man temple run with enemies bosses and ALOT of suits. This is a great game for iron man lovers
B003N5VOUO|4.0|A powerful, inspirational film about how anyone can make a difference in the people around them, even if they have a mental disability or are just plain &#34;different&#34;.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Do not waste your time with this movie. It will disappoint you. I know I was. Half of a star if I could
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My whole family loves this game. It's one of the easiest-to-learn and enjoyable games I've found that downloaded completely and without errors. Hours of amusement guaranteed!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It works great with my Samsung Galaxy S II. The Air Conditioner sound setting has a nice soft buzz / hum.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Tesla's Electric Mist was fun and challenging. It worked fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I prefer more puzzles, this was mostly point to find things you will need later. I remember about 10 other puzzles like sliding blocks and Simon. No hidden object (which I love.) Thank goodness there's a hint feature!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|From the video thought this would be cheezy fun. Was okay w/ the long additional download. The graphics are fine but the gameplay wasn't. Left/right tilting was reversed on the screen-- utterly annoying. And all you do is move left or right &amp; shoot stuff in front of you. Cheesy &amp; not fun. But the killer was the 13 minute wait for new armor. Gosh-- more 'not fun'. Jarvis-- please uninstall this immediately!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Jamie Foxx plays Django superbly!  He was best choice for the role.<br />A must see!!  Excellent film!!  Very Enjoyable!!  Awesome!
B000FA675C|4.0|This was Dan Brown's first novel I read and loved it. It was much better than his previous novel Angels & Demons. The movie sucked big time though.
1451613512|5.0|Quite apologetic for the actions of both American Socialists and the soviet state, but it's one hell of a documentation of state aggression in general.<br /><br />Follow it up with \\"The Ethics of Liberty\\" by Murray Rothbard to reach the logical conclusion of all the evidence presented in the book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. The story takes you through a range of emotions, but you will be happy once you finish. I would absolutely recommend this book!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice detailed weather forecasts are easy to get.<br />Daily, hourly, and even monthly.<br />The way the screens are layed out is really slick.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like to highlight and add comments to my PDFs. I hardly print documents anymore.<br />This app is exactly what I had missing in my Kindle Fire to read my documents.
B003097ABA|3.0|Supposedly, only the first three albums in this collection by the '70s strong starter that called itself \\"The Cars\\" are remastered (although far back in the early '90s). The third, \\"Panorama,\\" just didn't seem like it as evidenced by a dreadful drop out near the end of \\"Down Boys.\\" No reason to beef though as the group committed itself to a perilous downward spiral with the hit-and-miss quality of that album and the subsequent two which closed out the first line-up's existence. The price is right for anyone wanting to collect the studio output by the original band (not counting a previous box set with extras), but as someone so eloquently put it in another review of this collection, just individually purchase the songs that deliver as there are some absolute clunkers to feel remorseful about buying otherwise.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|I was captivated from the first sentence and remained that way until the journey ended..both hers and mine.  I admired her resolve and endurance and once again was convinced of the resilience with which we deal with challenges.  She truly was Queen of the PCT.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If there were anything I didn't like, it's that the books aren't finished yet. Awaiting the remainder of this tale with bated breath.
0553386794|5.0|Let me start off by saying watch the show first, that way you have a visual refrences to the people and not just names.<br />I am a casual reader and have never read a noval but I'm also the type of reader who gets so into the book and the cherecters that I find my self said when I'm done. This book will get you so intrested and the series goes on long enough that you feel it won't end so you stay extreamly intrested in the storyline.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've been a fan and have read all of this series as each new installment comes cout.  Vince Flynn continues to write a good, easy read, with plenty of action while developing the various characters which have appeared in his earler works.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|One of my favorite stories! Grew up with this as as child and I can't wait to share it with my kids someday!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Although this game has great graphics, it does take a lot of space on your kindle memory (especially if you have a kindle of 8gb of room). I also was not a fan of having to tilt the screen left to right in order for iron man to fly past objects, etc. I had to delete if I wanted to have other apps on the kindle due to the memory it takes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I bought up through Season 3 so far, and am half way through watching Season 3. The series is incredibly entertaining. It's difficult to limit yourself to one episode per night. I don't know about the DVD version, but the English subtitles on the Blue Ray version are just fine. There is no difference in the subtitles format or size from Season 1 and 2.  Someone mentioned an issue with Seaon 3 subtitles. Maybe they were talking about the DVD version. Blue Ray is fabulous.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was a great series that Fox made the mistake of canceling. It is not your standard fare sci-fi. Best to think of if a sprinkle of dark theme of Star Trek Deep Space Nine, mixed with western and science fiction. Very rich characters and great stories.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this app. I love backgammon but this is the first time I have played a computer that is almost like playing a real human being. You can also pick your difficulty level which is nice. I really enjoy this app and would recommend it to anyone who likes to play backgammon.
0786955570|5.0|This is a great game to play if you are into rpgs but don't necessarily want to take all the time necessary to set up characters and everything. NOT FOR KIDS. Just too much information and rules for a young child to understand. However, the little figures are really fun for them to play with!
B000B0WO0I|5.0|This compilation of songs are stripped down so that the listener can truly enjoy Mick's heavenly voice. Same material but without all the background music that can cloud a stellar talent. Worth the money and the wait!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. Lots of flying, blowing things up, action. Challenging but not so much you can't deal. Lots of cool suits too unlock although I wish each suit had its own specialized special move. But excellent game for a free download.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|A good place to put those thoughts you have while reading or using your apps.  It is very similar to the notepad in my iphone.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great graphics, love the gameplay and the controlers. Overall a great game on android. Been playing for a couple of days andi cant get enough.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|The book is a roller coaster ride that keeps you guessing through the entire story. I thought the main character was very well developed and the plot was very unpredictable and thought prevoking.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of Gaiman's novels.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I use this app often and find it suits my needs admirably. Thus far I've yet to run into any problems
B008M34INW|5.0|Don't expect Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon.  Different character.  Interesting, though.  A little more human.  More realistic, I thought. Good movie.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I have always loved this movie, and the 3D was fantastic!!  Highly recommended for any Jurassic Park fan!!  Hope to see the others in 3D soon!
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Disappointed in this release.  Wasn't expecting much but I just couldn't get into this movie...I say save the $4 and watch it later or redbox.
0763644765|3.0|I was hoping for a little bit more.  Unfortunately the book is not what I expected. Additionally the book is not in the best shape mi had to check to see if I had ordered a new book, which I had. Disappointed. O
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Jeffrey Archer is always good for an entertaining read and this one comes up to the mark but is not as gripping as his usual stories. I enjoyed it but didn't find myself glued to it by any means. It is clever and interesting, however, and well worth taking on holiday with you as its so easy to pick it up and put it down again and doesn't keep you from exciting activities, while it does fill a gap on a rainy day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game,easy but enjoyable. Realistic in a way. It has mini games inside the main game for the horse such as muck out her/his stall or cleaning the paddock. You work ur way up to being a pro jumper. You hace your choice of tack,clothing,paddock wear etc as well. However limited energy can be used within a given time.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great Book, excellent movie.  Loved both, glad I saw the movie first.  See it on the big screen if you can.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the next best thing since sliced bread for the bountiful Internet.  By far my Fav App there is.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a very cool game, but I feel like it needs more boosts like, mystery boxes, and other boosts. I really do like the game but I also feel that the store for the characters should be less expensive.
B000FA675C|4.0|Provocative and intriguing insight to the internal working of the Catholic Church as it struggles to maintain true followers. Does this explains the difference between the other religions.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Whoever made this movie was on drugs if they thought it made sense. It was confusing and horrible. Do not rent it!!
B00936A0RU|5.0|I thought this was a very good movie, and my daughter loved it, also.  I believe I was thinking about the movie &#34;Gangster Squad&#34; when I purchased it, but after I bought it, I was glad I did.  Check it out.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I like that it's easy to read and Tesla is my new hero! Wish he had a good and smart sponsor... then the world would be a better one

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Having fun with my 10 year old granddaughter and by myself with this app. Colors are vivid, the action is lifelike. I would give it 5 stars if some of the rare fish weren't so expensive to feed...this nearly forces the player to use real money for the game or never progress.
B009K72K0C|5.0|My 5 stars that I have awarded to season 5 is for the usual excellant production values MINUS THE WRITING.I possess season 1-4 on Blu-Ray of \\"The Clone Wars\\" and up to last week-end I have been impressed with my purchase however !!!!!!!<br />Last weekend in Australia we were presented with season 5 half on Saturday and half on Sunday,<br />the final episode of which the writers took leave of their senses.<br />Padawan Barriss was a closet baddie ?<br />And just where was her Jedi Master Luminara Unduli when her Padawan's brain was doing a loop<br />and turning into a murderer ?<br />And where are the Jedi Masters who can recognise a disturbance in the force from so far away<br />but cannot see truth in front of their faces ?  and that \\"Justice Hall\\" in the Temple .......<br />To have Ahsoka Tano and Barriss fighting together in season 2 \\"Weapons Factory\\" and \\"Brain Invaders\\"<br />the viewer can only conclude that the brain of Barriss was taken over again if it was not<br />for the words that the writers had her say.<br />I suppose that nothing is perfect, it was the 3rd film of Aliens and the 3rd film of X-Men<br />now it is the 5 season of The Clone Wars.<br />I had no problem with Ahsoka Tano leaving the Jedi order, but the way it was done was to my way of thinking a sad reflection on an excellant run of 4 years.<br />Needless to say the assembled Jedi Masters cannot even keep track of the Chancellor's mind.
0307476073|5.0|This is a memoir of a brave, young woman who heaves the weight of her own life onto her shoulders, then backpacks her past misgivings, sorrows and mistakes over 1,100 miles of the PCT. The book is well written and constructed in a framework that I found fresh and intrguing. She seems to walk-out her life's issues one mile at a time in order to purge herself of her past, to forge a new beginning for her future. And by the time she reaches the end of her journey, the task is done and the reader has a sense that she is ready to move on in a spiritual way into the next chapter of her own life. I also enjoyed the hike along with her as she describes the beautiful landscape of the American west. I finished this book with the feeling of satisfaction and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the great outdoors.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|I loved the late Bruce Lee and all of his movies.  I still think he's the best martial artist there ever was.  Enter the Dragon was missing from my collection and I'm happy I was able to get it.  Good movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|game is very interesting. I like how it doesn't make you put things in certain places. you can learn from trial and error.
B004EPYZOO|3.0|I liked this movie because of the action.  It was an okay story line, but if you like to see Nicolas in action as a dead man, this is for you.

B00846REIS|4.0|I loved this book, I thought it was a hot book. I read fifty shades, I really like it, but I thought this was much better than fifty shades. I couldn't put it down, I'll be starting the second book if not tonight then tomorrow.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I love Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as partners in Lethal Weapon.  I love action-packed police stories with a lot of crime drama.  I love all 4 movies and can watch them over-and-over again.  The acting was great.

0312330529|5.0|Wow!  This book is the kind of book that when you finish it you want to start all over reading it again.  The author is a wonderful, engaging and intelligent story teller.  What an incredible life and adventure he has lead.
B004529NKC|5.0|We've watched all of the Step Ups and totally enjoy the music and dancing. The energy and dance moves were great.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Funny, light, enjoyable take on a polio-stricken man's sex life. Helen Hunt is amazing, as always.  Macy is superb as a priest as well.
B007M45PMU|4.0|this album is intimate and honest. many of the songs have the raw feel of being recorded in a bar.  while i enjoy many of the songs, the album becomes a bit repetitive, with many songs sounding similar.  overall this is a great effort from a young band, i'm looking forward to what they do next.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The story line is great. enjoyed the entertainment value....Not as graphic as a cable backed show (HBO) but well done
B0000AUHPG|2.0|ONCE UPON A TIME, THIS MOVIE STARTED<br />(When I don't like a movie, the review is short and to the point.  Come on, at least I'm conveying a little something.)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this is great to carry in camping or backpacking.  the item is very light to carry.  I use my knife on camping trips to cut small wood branches for fire.  this light item is portable, easy to use and keep the knife sharp for all outdoor use.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|WE'VE WATCHED ALL OF THE STEP UP MOVIES AND WANTED TO GET ALL OF THEM ON DVD FOR KEEPS. THE ORIGINAL STEP UP IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE OUT OF THE ENTIRE SERIES.
B003MC5N28|4.0|A wonderful book for a young reader; Lowry affords children the opportunity to examine the gift of &#34;freedom of choice.&#34;
B000025KNO|4.0|Interesting CD.  Hearing so many other artists performing Dylan's music was great.  I like the second CD better than the first one.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I borrowed this album from a friend a while back, so it wasn't new to me. Still it's as satisfying as ever.<br />It's effing Dream Theater!<br /> Also, the seller set me up well: They delivered, without delay, even though I cancelled other items in the order. They did so even after the order had been processed.<br /> Wholly satisfied!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was a good read however, I am betting that the movie is way better.  I feel like I want more details.
B009R659L8|5.0|Actually my wife read this book. She told me tell you she loved it!  She said it was Mary Higgins Clark best book yet.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Watched all Step Up movies before but wanted to collect all of them on DVD. Great music and dance moves.
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|Ok, its been a long time coming!  But finally the Original Killswitch Engage is back together. In my opinion this is their best album since Alive or Just Breathing.  It features the original band line up with front man Jesse Leach returning to the healm. And feat Justin Foley on drums.  If you like Alive or Just Breathing you will like this album!  If you are a fan of the Howard Jones stuff then you should still enjoy this album.  If you get the special edition it features one song live by Jones &#34;My Curse&#34; Live and sung by Leach.  And I could hardly tell a deference.  Jesse does a good job making the song sound like Jones. It also features a live track &#34;Numbered Days&#34; from Alive or Just Breathing.  Personally for me this is a dream.  I loved the original line up and Jesse leach.  His lyrics and singing are amazing.  There are so many good songs on this album. if i had to rate them this how I would rate each song. All in all this is a great album and If your a fan of Killswitch its a must have.  It is an instant classic.  Also if you like This album and Alive or Just Breathing , I recommend checking out &#34;Times of Grace - The Hymn of a Broken Man&#34; It features 3 members of Killswitch Engage. Including Leach and Dutkiewicz. There are more religious implications in the lyrics but its a solid record. It sounds amazing and its one of my all time favorite records.  It has such emotion and feeling behind the music. Both of these records are amazing. And I totally recommend owning both albums.<br /><br />1.The Hell in Me  ***3/5 stars<br />2.Beyond the Flames **** 4/5<br />3.The New Awakening *** 3/5<br />4.In Due Time *** 3/5<br />5. A Tribute to the Fallen ***** 5/5<br />6. Turning Point *** 3/5<br />7. All We Have **** 4/5<br />8. You Don't Bleed for Me *** 3/5<br />9. The Call **** 4/5<br />10. No End in Sight ***** 5/5<br />11. Always ***** 5/5<br />12. Time Will Not Remain **** 4/5<br />13. Blood Stains *** 3/5 (Bonus track)<br />14. Slave to theMachine *** 3/5 (Bonus Track)<br />15. Numbered Days *** 3/5 (Live Bonus Track)<br />16. My Curse **** 4/5 (Live Bonus Track)
B008GFI4KY|5.0|I've been a fan of The Darkness since Permission to Land, and unlike a lot of people, I even loved One Way Ticket. Hot Cakes however, is even better than their debut. Every single song is catchy and full of powerful riffs and hooks. You can't go wrong with this album.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|See above. Period. I'm listening to it right now, and it fills me with pure, metal joy!<br />It's part of a trilogy, by the way. Buy all three parts. You can thank me later.
0385349947|5.0|I did not think I was going to like this book but bought for a book club. Couldn't put it down!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|read it on the recommendation of a friend - good choice.  Have recommended it to others and will probably read another book by this author
0671449028|5.0|Although the youngest of our five grandchildren is now eight and the oldest fifteen, Sandra Boynton's THE GOING TO BED BOOK still holds a place of honor in our playroom. This little gem has been read so many times that its spine is worn, and the book's gotten a bit rough around the edges. A beautiful book, bright and colorful. Sweet illustrations classic to Boynton's books, from brushing teeth to mix-matched pajamas. The moon is high and the sea truly deep... If you get a chance to read this book to your little ones, take it and enjoy. Boynton's sing-song rhymes inspire unforgettable, outrageous fun. Another wonderful Boynton's book is OH MY OH MY OH, DINOSAURS!<br /><br />Kids will love them...

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not been a fan of books in this genre but the subject matter (JFK) + the fact that the author is a contemporary of the time frame in which this awful date in our history occurred I was curious as to how that incident  would be portrayed and made relevant to today's readers.Not to worry MR. KING  hit<br />This one out of the park!!!
0316017930|4.0|Great information for educators. The knowledge gained from this book better explains how the brain works. I recommend this book for all educators looking to connect with their students.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book had a thought out plot, story line and introduced the characters very well!  Could not stop reading it, could not stop daydreaming of the things I wanted my husband to do to me.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is great for the price. It fits several lenses, my LED on-cam lights, my viewfinder, and much more. Satisfied with my purchase.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|My niece and I enjoyed this movie! Great continuance in the MIB series! Usually by the third, it's a disappointment. Not so here!
0385360177|1.0|Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse ...believe me it does!  If you thought the first book was bad, well you are in for a real \\"treat\\" - this one is even worse.  I should have known better going in, but I guess I am a glutton for punishment.  After this one, enough is enough.  Christian and Ana will have to carry on without me.  Even with the big cliff hanger ha ha!  I think permanent brain damage may be a result of reading another of these.<br /><br />This book is much more of the same but it is even more painful to listen to (yes, I subjected myself to the audiobook - at least if I would have been reading it I could have skipped a majority of the \\"story\\").  More laughable dialogue including those \\"hot\\" sex scenes.  Ana has to be the most annoying character I have ever run across.  I cannot believe that anyone can be as stupid as she is - and her inner dialogue and the whole inner goddess is beyond ridiculous.<br /><br />I honestly cannot understand all the hype about these books.  They have no plot, no characters with any redeeming qualities, no character development (unless you think that Mr. Grey's sexual predilection change is growth).  Well, I need more in a story than this.<br /><br />E J James is one lucky person - talk about being in the right place at the right time.  Wonder where her literary career can go from here --- guess she just needs another YA romance phenom for her next fanfic to cash in on!
B00CL0J99K|1.0|I'm reminded of a famous quote attributed to a musician Charles Ives paid so he could actually hear one of his compositions played. \\"How do I get this terrible music out of my head?\\" But Ives was a genius. This is a bombastic, franchise-ruining train wreck of a movie. No wit, no charm, no laughs- unless you count unintended humor. The good news is, I only saw it an hour ago and it's already fading away.<br /><br />Not really a super hero movie at all, it works tirelessly to deconstruct the whole notion of heroism. Inexplicably set at Christmas time, (was this thing intended for release 6 months ago, then sent back to the shop when they realized what a turkey they had on their hands?) it manages to mock all the values held sacred by Americans until about five minutes ago. With all its duplication and redundancy (is that redundant?) poor Iron Man comes off as just an empty suit. Gone is the snarky uber-confidence you expect from Tony Stark.  Instead, you get a whiny, cringing \\"vulnerable\\" Iron Man.  No thanks.  More than just emotionally tone deaf, this thing is atonal. Iron Man 3 is emotionally incoherent, dramatically unsatisfying, spiritually empty.  Other than that, it's great.  View at your own risk.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The author cut MANY corners in this final book and should have committed to a fully finished product.  It was a good read and I did enjoy the Trilogy.  This end book just left you hanging and skipped around A LOT!!!!!!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton is fantastic television, but watching it on blue ray is sweet. The colors and textures of the images make re-watching very enjoyable.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|man, was this worth the wait.  long time fan for decades.  really missed him and wondered whether we'd ever hear from him again...and then this gem.  great music and voice.  very strong set well worth the listen.
1476734941|5.0|I have struggled with weightloss all my life.  I have lost hundreds of pounds (literally) and put them all back on - plus.  This is the first diet book I have read from cover to cover.  It's interesting even if you don't want/need to lose weight!  I am starting my third week of intermittent fasting and feel great!  I look forward to the fast days as it allows me to excercize my culinary creativity.  I have lost a reasonable amount of weight and and don't feel like I am suffering.  I am restricting calories on my feed days to accelerate my weight loss, but don't panic if I go over.  This is definitely a plan, a lifestyle, that I can live with!  I'm very grateful and look forward to a healthier, leaner, me.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|What a unique way to entertain your mind. I am thoroughly enjoying this game thus far. And as so many have said, the music makes the experience very relaxing.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|What a complex character, this protagonist!  I liked her character development, interwoven with the whole scheme of flowers having their own language.  Also, it was an eye-opener to the circumstances of children in the system.  A good read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Full of heated passion and page turning suspense.  A pretty twisted way for characters to live their lives in the pages of a book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Told I had to read it by a friend.  The story is both terrifying and beautiful.  The historical thoughts are frightening in that America ever thought this was okay.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I did not expect to like this book, just by the cover and the title.  It just goes to show u should never judge a book by its cover.  Had to hold back tears in the end.  Only a great book can evoke such emotion.
0743201140|4.0|This book is a part of our organization's On-Boarding and we call it Building your own Brand.  Employees take the on-line test and concentrate on their five top strengths that are included in their 'Brand'.  Most new employees don';t want to be bothered with it, but after I show them the 'Brands' of other employees they readily see its importance.  We are a small company (about 50 employees) and using a template called BYOB (Building Your Own Brand) that is completed by each employee with a photo of their choice, a bio and answering four short job-relevant questions.  I post these on our company Intranet.  I've gone one step further and placed all of the BYOB's in a PowerPoint format.  This PowerPoint is presented at some of our All Staff meetings running under a timer and playing the embedded music 'We Are The World'.  They love it!

3836527286|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting.  Some material I've not seen before which is good.  I think I need more time to soak it in to say whether I'm really enamored with the selection of pictures.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Only left off one star because the packaging was a little beat up on one of the three that I purchased.  However, the price was great
0385349831|5.0|I love the light writing style of this book and Paulo has done a great job of taking the age old truths and letting them jump off the page without being preachy...<br /><br />A joy and inspiration to read and always a good reminder that &#34;Love is the only answer - always...&#34;<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000VOC90Y|3.0|It said \\"fits 17 Inch notebooks\\", and I have an Alienware M17x, which is slightly larger than 17\\". However, products like these should accommodate most 17\\" laptops easily, since most are gaming laptops and will stretch the bag a little wider and make it a bit more difficult to zip up the laptop. It does fit, just, barely (i.e. don't pack too many other things in the bag).
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I think the story line is interesting and it is fun to look for clues.  I recommend it!
B000002VSN|5.0|I loved the mixture of the soundtrack, from love songs to gospel songs.  I would recommend it to friends and relatives.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is a very good product, my son enjoys it and does not feel like staying away from it a bit.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Just going to make this real quick. I loved the product, works well, carry it everywhere. No problems at all.
B0067TQQI8|3.0|The battery pack works well. However, the cables that came with the charger had interchangeable tips. The micro and mini USB tips did not work with my Samsung galaxy S2 phone and Bluetooth headset. I contacted Anker. They promptly sent a replacement cable and USB tips. The replacement tips did NOT work either. I gave up and bought a set of third party cables from New Trent, that worked perfectly.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|the app its a useful tool and what I liked about is that it tells you what the alarm set is for, example work, school and so on.

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Anyone who knows anyone (or IS someone) with bipolar disorder, OCD, name it....knows that there is not a thing sweet or funny about coping with it. it is not cute, does not have a hip soundtrack, and causes tremendous anxiety for those individals, their loved oes, colleagues, and family. This film is a joke, an insult, and misses the mark, trying to frame something very serious in a &#34;cool&#34;, easily digestible and self-indulgent box. Sorry I bought it, sorry I got sucked in by the hype. Really? an Academy Award? Ugh. Save your money...better yet, rent &#34;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&#34; and soak in some incredible filmmaking.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is a great game I just have this one issue when opening it, sometimes it does not open rather it closes. Other than that it is fun.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|First experience with Hannibal and the show has inspiring me to read the novels. A fair amount of shows have come out that are similar to this one, but this is the only one that has managing to keep my attention and keep me asking for more.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Selections are very entertaining and run the gamut from sentimental to upbeat.  I recommend for anyone who enjoys good vocals and perhaps is a bit nostalgic.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Good twists, and it had me guessing until the end.  I wish it was a bit longer though, but still a good read.
B00886XQO0|2.0|I was looking to purchase a decent headset as i had just gave my old turtle beaches(X12)to my brother. I had no issues with the X12 headset. They sounded great and they had some cool features(volume, voice, and bass control). So I figured that the i should upgrade to a better turtle beach headset. I purchased the tango headset and was excited to start gaming with a pair of wireless headphones. There are a few wires that need to be plugged in from the xbox to the hub itself(one of those being fiber optic).It took me a bit to figure out how to actually pair my mic with my control so i could talk online. It has to be paired; it wont just automatically connect to the plug you connect to your control.It took me by surprise by how many features they crammed into this headset and with a 6 hour battery life on full charge it seems like a great headset. The problem was that after two months it started glitching on me. First the uneven sound coming mostly from one side. Then it kept turning off even when I had just fully charged it. It gets very annoying when your headset starts excluding audio from your game(background noises that make the game enjoyable or sounds as simple as your character moving). If you're going to buy a headset I recommend a pair of Astros. You're only paying two hundred fifty for the call of duty endorsement.You're better off getting a pair that can actually withstand some serious gaming.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my god, where to start. I loved this book from start to finish. I have never read a book that made me cry at the end. It brought so many emotions in me. I highly recomend this book to anyone. It has everything. Love, funny moments, tender moments, just powerful stuff. You won't regret reading this amazing story of Sky and Holder. Can't wait to read Holder's POV. I will definitely buy that one too.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The pop-up ads are maddening.  You deal a new hand, the ad comes up, and there's no way to get back to the game short of exiting and re-entering the app.  That alone keeps this from being a 5-star review, as the gameplay and controls are top-notch.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The beginning of the book was intriguing, the middle was interesting, but I did not like the final third of the book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great for touching up serrated knives- light and small enough to keep in the pocket all the time! Love this little gadget!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Rodriguez is such a humble man who took his fate quietly, I loved the movie and was moved to tears that he finally triumphed, his music is wonderful and you get the feeling there were underlying motives  as to why his music was not promoted, it was a shame it took so long for his music to surface. Everyone would love this movie

B0034G4P8A|4.0|For the Marvel series it's important to know each characters individual story as well as their team stories.  This one of course is for Thor but I found that I had to watch a couple of time to follow.  I did not read the comics as a kids however, so I was pretty green going in.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|After I started reading I didn't want to stop unlike other books where I become tired of reading half way through would recommend this book to everyone
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I can understand pre-adolescent boys getting off on Tarrentino's exploding catsup packs, but grown-ups? You gotta be kidding. There's no story here...just another ridiculous, repetitive, self-indulgent revenge fantasy a la Kill Bill (sword fights) and Inglorious Basterd's (baseball bats).<br /><br />In interviews QT tries to dress up this dreck up with his philosophical musings on violence (which boils down to violence is cool), but he's just another gore-monger, smarter and more audacious and more creative than the rest, but ultimately just as vacuous. His dramatic solution is always more catsup.<br /><br />With his pointed winks to exploitation genres of the past, he's saying \\"I'm far too hip to take this stuff seriously,\\" and the film critics buy his schtick.  Is it because they are hip to the film references and get to join Tarrentino in the cool boys' club?<br /><br />You can't blame QT for wanting to make money and be the darling of filmland, but I do blame the critics and other \\"intellectuals\\" for giving him cover.  Those critics who still take this guy seriously, I'm betting will be hiding their embarrassment 20 years from now.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great fun for everyone in my family! My kids and I play it on trips! When we can get my husband to put it down.

B000JMKQX0|1.0|Perhaps Max or his publisher should have proof read and then perhaps put out the third or fourth draft. Instead it seems, what  with all the inconsistencies and contradictions in this amateurish piece of garbage, that good old Max had a free weekend and just threw it together without so much as a quick once over reread before it went to publication. I read about 3/4ths of this waste of time before I just couldn't stand it anymore and didn't care how it ended. Don't waste your time, any half-wit 8th grader with half a chewed up pencil could write a better story than this. If I could have given it negative stars I sure as hell would have.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|For some reason, this is my favorite  show ever. I watched it every time I could catch it on TV and still do even tho I own it now. It came in perfect shape too.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great application a lot of fun when you have got nothing else to do. It's easy to play and its fun. I love playing this game..
B007SGM084|5.0|First let me say that this book is NOT PORN.  Yes, it has some very detailed sexual scenes in it; but the book is a TRUE romance story.  From the very first chapter, the writer sucks you in.  It is written so well that you can visualize everything so clearly and in great detail.  If you want to know what LOVE is.... if you want to know what ROMANCE is........ if you want to know what SACRIFICE is...... if you want to know what a person who TRULY loves you will give just to be with you, read this trilogy.  I recommend getting the trilogy because once you get into the 1st book, you will HAVE to read the second and third. It's like an addiction. Let me put it this way....... I am not a reader.  I have only read one complete book in my entire life before now.  After starting this trilogy, I was close to the end of the third book in a very short period of time (word for word, cover to cover).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what i needed. A simple user friendly calculator that supplies all my needs and eliminates the need for excess stuff.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Great sound (use your headphones for this one folks). Beautiful to watch and fun to play. There isn't anything quite like this out there, very unique game design.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this App, so easy to navigate and change from NIV to KJ or ? to see the different meanings through the different translations.
1400069807|5.0|shocking news about what we eat...and how we have been fooled by  the food industry into eatting fods that are bad for us
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Well, I love the Downton Abbey series, so I guess it's no surprise that I like Upstairs Downstairs. Both very good British period series. Highly recommended.
B0091WD4ZQ|5.0|A wonderful film. Not much happens--except two charming, intelligent people meet and fall in love, and we get to hear every word and watch every glance. All those funny, amazing moments come together in one night, and the locations are all perfect. Enjoy it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game you will play for hours. My only gripe is that it comes down to spending money to not be constantly bombarded with &quot;next level&quot; things.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun little game that makes you stop and think.  It's simple but fun to do.  Lots of levels so you can get it as challenging as you want.
B004I11VZA|5.0|In the vein of Jet Li's Fearless, this is a well acted and directed movie.  The fight sequences are not fantastical like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and I found I could really connect to the characters.  Buying a movie on disc is something I reserve for only those that I can watch over and over again, and this is one of those movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just played around with it in the beginning, but found it to be a great way to find, share &amp; store ideas, recipes, inspirations, quotes, etc.  Wish it had a way to tell when you've already pinned something though.
B002Y4Z4UQ|4.0|The album was released at a time when the group was in a decline as they grew and started to lose their child \\"cuteness\\". Also times changed in the music industry and bubble gum soul didn't sell that well any more, while the funk/disco era kicked in. So this album is the group's first attempt to go into that new direction. And actually it's a very good attempt.<br /><br />The Jackson brothers were still under the Motown label, so the songs were still written by Motown songwriters and the brothers still did not have creative control, but there are some gems there.<br /><br />There's some \\"experimental\\" stuff, such as Hum Along and Dance and Mama I Gotta Brand New Thing Don't Say No, but I can understand if some people feel these tracks are too long (more than 8 and 7 minutes long respectively).<br /><br />My favoite songs on the album are: Get It Together, Dancing Machine, You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You) and It's Too Late to Change the Time. Dancing Machine is of course a classic and it was first released on this album, although it was the remix version that was released a year later on the Dancing Machine album that went #2 on the Billboard Pop Charts.<br /><br />Michael was 15 years old at the time of this album and I love his vocals on this album. He doesn't have his small kid voice any more but it's not yet his fully adult voice. But it already has that MJ-like smoothness and warmth in it that he had as an adult. (I personally prefer this voice to his voice on earlier Jackson 5 albums.)
B0071DJZZA|3.0|The first 2/3 of this book was full of action and kept me involved, but an awkward romance was introduced towards the end and I felt it fell away.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Do not buy this item - it worked fine for about a month then it stopped working this past weekend, about two months after it was purchased.
B003INBOEM|5.0|In the vein of Jet Li's Fearless, this is a well acted and directed movie.  I wrote the same description for this movie and Ip Man 2.  The fight sequences are not fantastical like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and I found I could really connect to the characters.  Buying a movie on disc is something I reserve for only those that I can watch over and over again, and this is one of those movies.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|who does not love shreck ? i ordered it so when my grandkids come we have a funny movie to watch .. always a good choice
B001JP5JRY|4.0|The Bro Code is for Bros. Anyone buying this book for edification and celebration of the connection of all humanity should - well, get over themselves. This book was \\"written\\" under the instruction of a misogynistic, narcissistic fictional character.<br /><br />But the code itself is very, very real. Admittedly not having the appropriate plumbing for most men to consider me a dude - I have on occasion been bequeathed the honor of being a Bro (gaming and comic addition will do that). I appreciate the codification of what my duties are, as the female gender does not adequately prepare one for the honor that is Bro-hood.<br /><br />Thank you Barney (through the pen of Matt Kuhn) - you are a true Bro.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|Then you will love the book!<br /><br />Really interesting story that takes you into the world of mental illness with humour and great characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. I love that I had no idea what was coming. I just want to go right back and read it again! I want everyone I know to read it, so I have someone to talk about it with.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great Movie from start to finish!! My husband and I loved it!!! This is one to buy.. not just rent!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|I'm sorry to say, I'm not a fan...I couldn't even get it to connect with Face Book at all, maybe if I had it wouldn't have disappointed me as much. It just wasn't what I expected.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The acting is impeccable and the actors interrelate realistically.  I enjoyed all the dramatic ups and downs with the air of non predictability !
B002OSXDAU|5.0|A book that makes you appreciate what is necessary to value yourself and what you have accomplished.<br /><br />I would recommend that it be required reading for young teenagers.
B008OJ291W|5.0|You either like or dislike ELO. Jeff does a great job on this remake. Any music Jeff produces is worth taking the time to listen to or purchase.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Complete seasons aren't as good of a deal on Amazon as I would like for them to be. There is so many shows that I would love to buy the complete seasons but I think they are a little pricey.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I think you can win the game with money in my opinion which is okay if you enjoy it that way of course.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Great game. Very educational but very costly if you want to take the game all the way to he end.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the best suspense novels I have read in a long, long time.  It is very well written and gives me the shutters of &#34;what if this happened in my family&#34;?
0525953728|2.0|I mean, I preordered this book, and as soon as I received it, I sat down and read the whole thing from cover to cover in one sitting.  (i've never done that before).  Sure, it was interesting, but you can just tell it's full of crap.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with the story when I read the first page. It features a great storyline, one that you rarely see in any book. Hazel is by far the most heroic female I have ever got the privilege to read about. Funny and charming, this book makes me see through new eyes.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I got Jorte calendar for my wife so that we could have a comprehensive calendar while at doctor's offices, etc., making appointments.  Everything was rolling along fine until the app blocked its use until we went online.  We did this once at our dentist's office who has wi-fi.  It worked for about seven weeks than shut down again demanding internet access through wi-fi.  I am well aware of the wi-fi world, but my wife and I do not frequent places that have the service(which in some cases is not encrypted).  I look at wi-fi as another way to access the internet, but would also like to use my computer and download apps like you can the books.  Even if initial install require wi-fi, which is fine, I am not happy that it requires continued contact, especially as some of these programs want a lot of permissions.  I would buy a calendar program if I could find one that is capable of allowing one to use it only on the kindle.<br /><br />Update 8/21/2013.  I finally purchased a wi-fi router so the problem is now moot.  My wife is using it all the time and likes it.  I am still keeping the review the same as I still do not think one should have to be connected to the internet to keep an appointment book.<br /><br />Update 12/27/15.  She has no problem with it and uses it all the time like at a doctor's office.  Whatever was going on she insists does not happen anymore.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Saw it first on the big screen, the best way to do it.  It was not what I expected but it was a wonderful and moving story and wonderfully done.  I will watch it many times and share it now that I own it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Thank you to everyone involved;  I mean EVERYONE involved, for this magnificent series.  You have returned CIVILITY to television.  Who could have ever guessed how starved soooooooooo many people in so many countries were for CIVILITY to be restored.  What pure pleasure you have provided.  Please, keep it coming.  We're living for September!!!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I think I love this movie more than my daughter does! Adam Sandler did a fantastic job! But of course!!! :)
B003NWS5AO|5.0|this is a great album....love what Plant is doing these days...and no one on this with him is a slouch either....all the songs are likable and eventually have that &#34;sticks in your head&#34;...effect....stellar...of course you have to like this type of music....but on the other hand I could see this making converts....but it is a good album....
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Truly excellent upgrade from any previous version, except for all the annoying clutter/ads at the beginning and one programming error. If you play an isolated episode and jump over the closing credits, you wind up in a trap screen from which there is no exit except to stop the player and restart the disc. This did not happen if I let the credits play out fully. A minor annoyance, perhaps, but, given the cost of the package, I expected a debugged product. Maybe they got in a hurry.<br />  The previous seasons looked too cheezy to play on a big screen but not this one. The photography is stunningly good in places.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This novel, as well as the prequel Entwined with You, is a well written sensual novel. I couldn't put it down and have already read these two books three times. I can not wait to read the final book in this trilogy. Defiantly a must read!
B00ADLCC9I|4.0|I bought mainly to use playing emulated games.  There is plenty of storage space for that.  A lot of the games I am playing have built in mapping tools for the buttons.  Try the mapping tools in the game before you use the Archos mapping tool.  Overall this tablet performs very nicely for playing emulators.  Although the battery life isn't the best, I usually don't have two hours to sit down and play anyway, so it has not been a problem for me.
1605144967|5.0|As those of us who listen regularly to books know, the reader makes all the difference.  Ron Silver is a brilliant reader of Roth's work, both of American Pastoral and also The Plot Against America (though there is a somewhat tinny echo on this latter recording).
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I mean-rate it 5....unless they would have totally dropped the ball....Now I will say these things....sound quality/mix/engineering is a bit better on the dvd than the cd's....I had to make EQ readjustments throughout-on both car stereos anyway-on the cd's....and I think that the modern technology and style of mix has hurt-for instance the drums sounds good-but are mixed standard 2007, part of Zeppelin's signature sound was the open and uncompressed drum and guitar sound...(guitars were also a bit over compressed and squelched on the cd) but the discs are still good....Performances, however were stellar...you do have to get used to Jason..this is not a bad thing. In some technical ways he's better than his dad (don't start freaking out-there is more than just technique to music and John's feel and fit to Zep is unmatched) and he plays the parts faithfully but with his own flavor  and style -as well-which he should. I am not a purist as far as that goes. But if you are totally married to  album versions note for  note-(or other live versions)-then you may be disappointed-but he plays smashingly. There is no disappointment to this set for anyone else though. These guys can still do it-oh maybe not quite as crazy frantically as a 1970's era show-but probably more sober and a little cleaner....and at an age that most wouldn't even try to do it. and a good cross section of their material, although there is nothing from &#34;In through the out door&#34; I just realized...still great-buy it
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I love this game and I am totally addicted. I love the sound effects and the backgrounds. I would give it five stars if it took me right to the level I am to play next but I love it still.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and keeps you moving a lot. My son really enjoys this game.  He's good  We like the graphics. Fast paced
B00B2166BS|5.0|Pogo cable and charger is much quicker to charge my device and also easier. This has saved me time recharging and allows me to use my tablet while it charges without the discharge issues.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|It's okay.  It seems that it could have been more.  There are some stupid parts.  For example, why would you drive right up to a police road block and start shooting when there is only two of you against a ton of others.  Maybe moonshiners didn't have a lot of sense but why wouldn't you sneak around through the woods.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|AMAZING GAME!  The game ended too quickly but we did enjoy it while it lasted.  Hopefully with all the positive remarks the next room will be here soon. There was enough twists that made you think and that is good, you don;t want it to be too easy because then it becomes boring. I stopped on purpose after reading the reviews so that it would last longer.
1401937519|2.0|Up front I have to say I did not like this book at all. I will admit that there is a possibility that I just am not capable of understanding what he author has to say, but it seems to me, here is the entirety of what she has to say:<br />1) she had a painful and difficult time trying to be what others in her culture wantedher to be, eventually she learned you have to be true to yourself<br />2) she had a bad cancer and was miraculously cured following a NDE in which she felt connected to the unity of everything in this universe, and she came to the realization that what we call God is actually just a state of being and she is, now in her NDE , that stae of being. Huh? What ever happened to the being hat transcends time and space and is eternal and infinite and omnipotent andcreated each one of us AND created the universe out of nothing, I.e., creatio ex nihilo?<br />3) carpe diem and be true to yourself. Is this a rerun of an Oprah show?<br />4) no tunnel, no white light with an incredibly powerful entity, unconditionally loving and doing a life review for you to judge yourself. No happy, joyous reunions with loved ones except she did feel the spirit of her father at one point and realized he had always been with the family after his death.<br />5) what is one's purpose, one's tasks in eternity...never examined.<br />No, I would not have spent my money on a book that seems so out of sync with that which, most famously, Raymond Moody describes over and over again. I thought the small part of the book that dealt with her NDE woefully I adequately described the experience!
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Easy read, if you know a bit about trail running or if you don't you can enjoy Jurek's story telling of his ambitious running career. As the title indicated it is a simple and straight forward telling of Jurek's lifestyle as a vegan, and his accomplishments and struggles as a ultra marathoner.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I rented this from Amazon Instant Video and, I must say, it was visually interesting! Watching this was a great way to spend an evening at home.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|One of the few instances where the video production is far better than the book, which goes into such detail on characters that it becomes quite tedious.
B004MYF4SS|3.0|I haven't finished it yet but I find it difficult to read, it doesn't flow.  A good plot, but not my taste.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Finished it in two days - I could have finished in one day but sleep and food got in the way.  What a great book - a real page turner.
0385349947|5.0|So excited to read the book, a great and straight forward telling of one woman's story. I definitely think that particularly for young professionals this is an important book to take some time to read, not everyone will identify with all aspects of this and yes many concepts are straight out of a gender class but its important to be aware of how the issues of women in business and gender issues apply to living and working not just as an academic exercise. Absolutely loved the book and hope to see more people enjoy it and use it a place to begin again to seek to progress on a fundamentally important issue for our generation as a whole not just women.
B001PS7NL0|5.0|This dictionary of grammar is just amazing! It has so many examples on the grammar points and all of the grammar is neatly organized in alphabetical order. This is one of the absolute best books that I have gotten to help me learn Japanese and I highly recommend this for any Japanese learner studying intermediate Japanese grammar! ^-^
B0087ITBPC|5.0|The Guilt Trip is a fun, pleasant, very enjoyable movie. You will find some laughs and chuckles along the way with poignant moments here and there. Barbra Streisand plays a very likeable, down-to-earth woman who is a devoted mother with a romantic past her son does not know about. Seth Rogen plays the son who is struggling with his life and finds some success when he follows his mother's advice. This is a light, but heartfelt film where Streisand really shines as a woman who is easy to identify with and who you would want as a friend - her warmth, sense of caring, and sense of humor really come through.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|simple and effective. I use it for sleeping and it is great. good assortment of sounds to choose from and a handy timer.
1594135851|4.0|I have not read these, but my junior high aged daughter is now on Mocking Jay.  She quickly read the first two (within 2 weeks) each book.  She said they were great and could not put them down.  They have violence, so that might be a turn off for some parents with younger readers, but for mature 12 and 13 year olds and above, it is probably okay.  I'm just glad to see her enjoy reading, rather than just want to play video games or watch t.v. during her down time when not in school or sports.
B00181MHQU|4.0|There are several musicals that will be standouts for the ages. And this is only one of them. I can watch this over and over again. It has a plot involved with all the dancing - the boys vs the boys and not only that also the girls.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I originally bought this mouse for my brother as gift since i was handing down my old desktop to him and he was in need of a decent mouse to game with. After receiving the mouse in the mail, I decided to test the mouse out myself for a couple of days and It was as I had expected for the price and a little more. The mouse is comfortable and goes along my mouse pad smoothly with no hiccups at all (something that my Imperator occasionally does). The set of weights and the UI that came out along with with this were also rather welcome and something I did not expect for a mouse that sold for so cheaply. But on the downside, the mouse feels rather cheap, the UI has some issues, especially loading different profiles (the setting don't seem to save when you create a new one). Overall this is a great mouse for the price, and will definitely looking out for anymore Anker products.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book keeps you on the edge. Such a dramatic way to end the story. I absolutely loved it. Can't wait for it transform into a movie.
0385349831|5.0|A many read and pickup and get inspired book! Will share the thoughts and insights with as many people as I can. Recommend to others, I am sure, for years to come. Timeless wisdom inside this little gem! Thank you, Paulo!
B003B5M0PO|5.0|i loved this story, it gripped me from the start, i felt i was really listening to the horse's story.<br />i dont think it is suitable for young children although i know it was written for children,<br />perhaps young teens.<br />anyhow i loved it and have since watched the movie, also great
B002VHI8J0|5.0|What a joy to read an author at the height of their powers. A large, complex and interlocking tale about the human condition. Includes many areas I enjoy, including a bit of history and some speculative fiction. Can't wait to see the movie now that I've refreshed by memory with a re-read
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban has a fantastic voice and very enjoyable to listen to.  If I were about 100 years younger I would be drooling.
B000RO9VJK|3.0|The book started out strong with incisive observations about the realities of starting a business.  However, it went from objectivity to the smooth ranting of a tele-evangilist.  By the end of the book the author seemed determined to convince us that what starts as a nightmare will turn into perfect bliss if his methods are followed, especially if you contact his organization for coaching.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|There are thousands and thousands of movies out there for people to watch. There is comedy, action, romance, horror, and many others. I dislike horror movies because they give me nightmares, I become afraid of the dark and because of the scenes that just jump out and spook me. First, and foremost, horror movies give me terrible nightmares. After watching a horror movie, I don't even want to go to bed because I know what I will have coming my way. As soon as I fall asleep, I start having nightmares. I can feel someone or something just staring down at me wanting to sink their untrimmed nails into my face. Also after watching a movie I tend to be afraid of the dark. I can see a long bony hand rich out from the darkness and take my covers from me and just reaching over grabbing me and pulling me in with it. It's a horrible sensation. Another thing that scares me about these movies is the scenes that just pop up and spoke you. These are reasons why I dislike watching scary movies. I would much rather watch a comedy and have a good laugh or watch an action packed movie. But, overall Mama was a good movie that had me glued to my seat and would recommend it to a friend.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a good hidden object game. You can unlock rooms the more you play and you don 't have to be connected to the Internet to do that. You visit the different rooms and find the objects. Even when you visit the same room again, the objects are shuffled up so it's not the same way every time.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I am extremely critical of television, especially reality tv and how it kills brain cells and IQ points and generates a level of narcissism world wide that is the ultimate control for those in power.  However, there are very few shows worth watching, very few.  Besides Doctor Who, this is the only other show I watch religiously and wait ever week with bated breath.  The triple combo (BD, DVD, digital) makes it perfect for anyone, prices on amazon are by far cheaper, and the behind the scenes with Emilia Clark will make you fall in love again.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I liked it but thought the initial reviews kind of overrated it.  I think I was expecting more historical information.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Sloan is a great writer and has served up a fun, somewhat tongue in cheek, tale.  Would recommend for anyone who is fascinated  with where computer intelligence can take us.
0143116371|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK. It's unlike any book I have ever owned. I can get inspiration from it as well as learn from people's styles and stuff.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements: Be impeccable with your word, Don't take anything personally, Don't make assumptions, Always do your best. I'm sure anyone's life would be exponentially better if they could implement these agreements. I'm working on it. The book is short, easy to read and very calming. I don't know why, but Ruiz's books always seem to calm me down when I read them. I recommend the book for that alone, I think it's the simplicity of the message.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome i built a monument of a diamond sword and made a giant tower for a tower defense mini-game to do with my friends
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|So much fun because you get to interact with Tom .It's like he's your own friend.If you buy the app you will have fun with it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|These are the best of the Star trek flicks.  The Robert Wise directed first Trek film is an epic. Love the epic theme music and the camera panning slowly across the Enterprise.  After viewing it you will be saying &#34;V-ger&#34; to everyone.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|First: The actual show.  The SHOW.  Does it even need a review?!?! I am addicted to this show.  It's brilliantly written and fun and intellectually stimulating to watch.  They are loyal the the original but still make it very modern and techy.  The acting is phenomenal and I am constantly floored by the emotional and mental investment I have in this show.  Watch it.  You won't regret it.<br />Second: The actual physical product.  This arrvied early and in great condition.  It's nice to find a decently priced Region 1 BBC show.  I never spoke to the sellers but I had no need to because everything was easy and smooth.
B0091REZMW|5.0|cool app lots of fun. really enjoy playing this app. worth downloading. no problems or crashes with this game.  def worth it
B008JFUO72|4.0|This 3rd, and I suspect last, entry of Marvel's Iron Man maintains the momentum of the predecessors thanks primarily to Robert Downey, Jr. as rich industrialist/inventor Tony Stark who outed himself as Iron Man in the first film.  Director Shane Black takes over the director's duties replacing Jon Favreau, who's still on board as Tony's friend Happy Hogan.  Even after The Avengers (which includes Iron Man) stomped the aliens month's earlier, human bad guys are still out to get America.  This time it's an Osama bin laden style character known as \\"The Mandarin\\" (Ben Kingsley) or Man Darin as he is known in China.<br /><br />The evil Mandarin takes aim at Tony after Stark promises to come after him.  Tony's great house is destroyed with Tony and live-in girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) inside.  The Iron Man suit is malfunctioning and Tony must recover using his wits and plenty of movie magic.  He befriends a pre-teen boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who helps him get going again.  Tony is homing in on the Miami (!) based lair of The Mandarin who he has vowed to kill.<br /><br />Introduced into the film are Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a man with ideas that Stark shunned years earlier and his technical assistant Maya (Rebecca Hall) who Tony bedded that same night.  It appears Killian is supplying The Mandarin with the warfare needed to terrorize the world.  That includes some newly enhanced soldiers.  This all leads of course, to the big showdown and the filmmakers spare no expense.<br /><br />The film is a bit of an anomaly.  On one hand it is a bit darker.  Tony has developed a case of severe anxiety for example.  But it also has plenty of humor, most of which is supplied by Downey, Jr.  And the Iron Man suits don't always work.  They stumble and fall.  So is there anything wrong?  Well sure.  For one, I would like to see more byplay between Pepper and Tony.  The actors have great chemistry together.  Why not exploit it?  There are some continuity issues.  There's a scene where Tony, without his suit, is fending off the bad guys in a darkened building.  He more than holds his own, both with his fighting and his shooting prowess.  In the climax however, he and his buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle) are zeroing in on the bad guys and it appears Tony never fired a handgun before.  Quibbles?  Sure.  Iron Man 3 is loud, explosive and full of humor.  Great entertainment.scene where Tony, without his suit, is fending off the bad guys in a darkened building.

B00846REIS|4.0|It was a great book to read although it does remind me of fifty shades of grey. I can't wait to read to next one!
B0089J270U|4.0|All the &#34;Marilyn&#34;  blu-rays have been exquisite.  If you like the big-budget, old fashioned musicals, this is one of the best!  The story was nominated for an Oscar, the year I was born.  So, this is a very special movie for me. And oh that platinum gown!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|This movie is awesome i ordered it for my daughter and i got a chance to watch it with her it was great
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has amazing graphics and requires thought. The storyline is just vague enough to make you wonder what the background is, but doesn't make you sit through silly videos to get to the puzzles. Really, really enjoyed this and can't wait for more from Fireproof.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am a diehard Jodi Picoult fan.  I've read every book of hers that I can get my hands on, wondering if she can capture me as she has done on the past.  To date (and I DO think I've read every book she's ever written), she has not disappointed me.  I keep wondering: &#34;how does she do it?&#34; How can she write with so much feeling, with so much in depth knowledge of her subjects, time and time again? I don't have the answer to that question ... I only know that she does.<br />In The Pact, she believably captures an incredibly nuanced story of young love. Emily and Chris are born just months apart.  Their mothers are best friends and next door neighbors. Em and Chris spend all their lives together, growing through childhood, adolescence, and, finally, young adulthood. Their story asks many questions, such as: how can a person make the transition from a brother/sister relationship to a husband/wife relationship? How can one love a person so much that they would harm their loved one, if asked to, by that loved one? What is love, anyway?<br />When life's necessities required that I put the book down, I carried both Chris and Em in my head.  I couldn't wait to get back to them.<br />I loved this book!<br /><br />I never know, from one page to the next, where the story is going.  Her stories are like life, full of twists and turns.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a good game but doesn't have that many features.it doesn't have buckets or rail.overall it is the worst edition.
0802473156|5.0|I am still readying the book and so far I love it. It gives great tips in how to improve your relationship with your partner. I would recommend for those who is trying to understand the type of love your partner likes to show.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|There's no Stallone in this!?!<br />I was apprehensive to even rent this movie, but I found it witty, romantic, and entertaining enough to rewind it a few times. The acting was superb and the plot was well thought out.<br />This coming from a guy that watches movies like Safe House...<br />Or maybe I could just relate to the dysfunctional family!<br />I laughed, I cringed, I cheered this movie on.<br />Great 2 hours.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.  After reading the Author's Note at the end, I loved it even more.  This story willed itself to be told and was told wonderfully.  I would love to know Ms Grissom's thoughts about the prologue....whether or not she debated about adding that.....  It impacted the way I read the book and I wonder if that was her intent.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This CD, and the music these people play/sing, reminds me of REALLY old school blue grass or even earlier Appalachian music.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I did enjoy this movie and Tom Cruise's acting was great, but it left way too many unanswered questions.  I wish it would have explained the villain's motives and the nature of their crimes.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I could not believe how funny this movie is!  If you know about Close Encounters, E.T., Star Wars, then you MUST see the i movie.  Even Steven Spielberg is in on the spoofs!  He talks to Paul, the alien, about ideas for E.T. Movie.  Just Hilarious.  You will want to watch it again and again!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Tested the rdp with windows 7 on android phone samsung galaxy S2 and it worked great. Controling windows 7 pc with the android phone wokred flawlessly.
0441009425|2.0|As others have said, the plot is quite interesting but it progresses way too slowly and the writing is pretty flat. For example, about 1/3 of the way through the book I was on the verge of giving up. So I skipped ahead another 1/3 and started reading. I picked up RIGHT where I left off! I knew exactly who everyone was, what was happening, etc. Nothing happened during the middle 1/3 that was either unpredictable or important to the plot. I finally gave up when a couple of weeks went by with it unopened next to my bedside. I sat down to read it today and said \\"eh, do I really care what happens?\\" and opened a new book instead.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is one of our very favorite classic movies for the holidays!  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition for us to enjoy before Christmas.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Celine's concert was not only wonderful to listen to but was also a delight to watch.  Although I normally don't like dancers interfering with music, they did a remarkable job blending in with Celine's music and giving her time to change for her next number.  The lighting and special effects were great as was the sound.  If you like Celine Dion, this is the concert to buy!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Many of the reviewers have given opinions on the transfer quality, color quality or other technical features of the movies.  That is all well and good but if you like to nit-pic the movies and make comments about what is wrong or could be better, forget it.  I know a person who does that and I do not watch movies with that person unless I have too.<br /><br />I enjoy these movies for what they are, great entertainment for Trekies.  I will say the Blu-ray movies are super and it does make all the difference.  Sit back and enjoy, get into the story and don't get ahead of the plot.  Some of the movies are better than others, but they are are all Star Trek.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|My six year old son loves this game.  It is a good strategy game for his age.  I tried the hard level and found it to be no more difficult than the easy level.  I didn't get the game for me though.  Adult rating would probably be a three.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|GREAT MOVIE WITH LOTS OF HUMOR AND A GOOD LOVE LOST STORY. ME AND MY WIFE LOVE IT. POOR SHIPPING AND GOOD PRODUCT.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had a hard time getting into it because at first it reads like a 5th grader telling a story, but as it went on I saw the point and I really enjoyd the story.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|We liked this movie.  There is lots of action, twists and turns.  Denzel does play a really good bad guy.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Of all the movie Bonds, Daniel Craig's version is most like the character Ian Fleming created for his books - very capable, very grim,  humorless, and extremely dangerous.  Craig's movies are very good, but Sean Connery is still the favorite.
B00005JPSM|4.0|GREAT MOVIE WITH LOTS OF HUMOR AND A GOOD LOVE LOST STORY. ME AND MY WIFE LOVE IT. TIMELY SHIPPING AND GOOD PRODUCT.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a tough one, with a new author and all, but i felt satisfied that most of the plots series points and relationships were touched on (even the town that came back to life every morning got utilized in the battle).  I started in Jan. re-reading the entire series to be ready for the final book release and feel very satisfied witi the ending.
141694737X|5.0|My son is 14 months and loves this book. The pop-ups are adorable and he loves to open them. It is not a book for words but my son never gets sick of seeing the animals and opening the flaps. This book was worth the money for sure!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I'm not a videophile, really.  In fact, this was my first set of blu-ray discs, despite the fact that I've had a BD player for years, so I don't know the difference between &#34;ideal&#34; and &#34;very good&#34; digital remastering/restoration.  With all that, I would say these discs look and sound fantastic.  I've watched four of the six movies and they're all uniformly clear, crisp, bright and colorful.  The detail pops off of the screen.  They're really a revelation.  I would say that they're a must for nay lovers of the original movies.
B000683VI4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE WITH LOTS OF HUMOR AND A GOOD LOVE LOST STORY. ME AND MY WIFE LOVE IT. TIMELY SHIPPING AND GOOD PRODUCT.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Real good show and very informative.  This picture was one that will peek your interest in our nation's history and keep you coming back for more.  A must see for Civil War followers.  One word:  Outstanding!
1476734941|4.0|This diet book has some very good suggestions for following the 2/5 diet.  It would be better if it had more accurate calorie counts for american- size foods, such as eggs and if discussed artificial sweeteners.
B00BQ215IC|5.0|I have bought this book again & again for the graduates in my life.  Such good advice!  I have read  it cover to cover at least 3x!  I highly recommend this book!
B001CMSTBM|5.0|Texas Dirt music at it's best.  Definietely work your $s and time.  These guys are great and are going places for sure!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Old fashion great entertainment. Not a lot of high tech graphics but good movie making. I recommend it. Do more like this...
B00632HWOG|5.0|Excellent for quick email retrieval.  Happy to have it for my Kindle Fire.  Makes sending and receiving easy and effective.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I thought this game was going to be really hard, but not so.  It is great fun and we have played it a ton. Take note that you can only have 4 players.  If you want more players you have to buy the extension ack. Our friend have the extension pack, so we have played with 6. The great part about that is then it is like a new game. Great fun, never quite the same, kids love it too!
B00BXKKNFS|3.0|Hard to tell how many adds are blocked,still get a number of adds, but not as many as before. seems to work to some extent.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers are really good for kids and grown ups because it makes you try your best. For example, I play 20 times a day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it! A great game for when you are bored<br />I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others<br />A easy to pick up game for almost anyone<br />Five star!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Amazing amazing<br />Amoozing<br />Awesome game event I ever played in my life I'm awsomer than this game ever played in your life
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I would def recommend this movie, one of those that I could watch several times. You gotta love Matthew McConaughey!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I was surprised how good the series was.  I am anxiously awaiting the next season.  I am hooked on Sons of Anarchy!
B00004U45G|5.0|In college in the nineties, I once called into a classic rock radio station in Utah and requested that they play some Black Crowes.  They spoke back to me like I was some kind of a weirdo for even suggesting it.  A couple of weeks later, I heard them announce on their station that they were going to do something that was very bold and brave.  They announced that they would begin playing the Black Crowes on their station right alongside all of the other classic rock.  A few years later, this album came out.<br /><br />Some things are obvious.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging but not impossible with the available hints. Able to complete in a few hours. Relaxing. Love the graphics and animations. Looking forward to more. Thank you for a quality game.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Got here fast and I am enjoying all of the seasons Big Bang has out as of now. Very happy with my purchase.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The best movie ever....Hugh Hackman play an spectacular role....love the movie is 3 in one.  I recorded in my computer
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|nice packaging and a great deal. Loved watching on Neflix but they only had a few. now I have the complete set at aawesome price
B00AFEY354|5.0|but I loved this movie!  So glad to have it in my small collection.  My daughter and I both enjoy it!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Cd is great and from the movie and includes one more song that thy couldn't use for the broadway show.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game because you can get all the cool armors.  I like the shotgun the best out of all
B00005N9CV|3.0|I thought that I was going to absolutely love this album.  I love her look, the fact that she is married to Elvis Costello (who is completely unique and one of my favorites), and her voice.  But for all the critical acclaim about this CD, I thought her phrasing is uninspired and the songs were mediocre.
0385738765|5.0|The Scorch Trials, Written by James Dashner is a prime example of exciting modern literature.  The Scorch Trials was easy to read and understand, and required little effort to grasp.  The story helped me to escape from reality, bring me into a completely different and exciting world.  The events that took place in the story seemed real, and were a good example of what could happen to our society.  The story was filled with vivid imagery; however complex messages and irony were slim. The story stayed consistent and easy to follow throughout.  It never introduced too many plots or characters at a time, and all loose ands and unanswered questions were solved by the end of the story.  The story shows how easily our civilization could fall into dystopia, and what mass chaos it would cause.<br />The story allows readers to escape into another world that is fast paced, and is always keeping you on edge.  The story is written in a way that allows you to create a detailed image in your head of what it would be like to really be in the story. This allows readers to forget everything that is going on around them, and enjoy a good story. The book was fast paced, and humorous. At the end of each chapter, I always found myself wanting to keep reading, because the author did such a great job at keeping things interesting.<br />When a closer look is taken at the issues talked about in the scorch trials, it becomes clear that it is hinting on what could potentially happen to our own society. The dystopian society in the book can easily be compared to our society today. It gives readers a chance to think what could happen to our world today, and how prepared or unprepared we are for it. The book touches on topics that are not that far out from today's technology such as teleportation, mind control, and the ability to change ones memories or opinions on a certain event or person.  The story provides an opportunity for readers to look at what is good and evil in our world today, and what we need to do to keep things in check. Overall, the book really is great.  It takes you on a journey to a fantasy land that everyone is sure to enjoy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|oh well good while lasted. I just don't want to have to pay for something that said free. the graphics are great.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|i really have fun with this and the kids love it too.  sometimes it J's a little annoying.  not a fan of how competitive it is though.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|I love the woman's voice, and I bought the album with enthusiasm after listening to her on Pandora.  But once the album arrived, I decided that it was underwhelming because of the orchestration and her choice of songs.  She is good but she (hopefully) will become great.
1476734941|5.0|This book was easy to read great stories to inspire you and a very easy plan to follow. This is a lifestyle
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a really fun game. Full of high energy and a purpose with fighting enemies and getting new suites built.  The game play is smooth and makes it comfortable and enjoyable to play.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|The soft-ware with this product does not rate one star. If you need technical help ( and you will ) Sony will make it impossible to get. To register this product with Sony requires the input of 59 character code ( which will not take). I have bought many Sony products over the years, this is the last as it has filled me with buyers remorse.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I love Michael Buble's voice, but I didn't think that his lineup of songs was particularly inspired.  But I hope Michael is around for many decades to come, and I am sure that the selection is going to improve.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I have collected all 3 seasons. First, the quality of this DVD is superior, I believe it has better sound quality than any DVD I own. And of course, there's the content. I hope to own all of the Downton Abbey series as it progresses (hopefully for years and years). it's hard to go wrong here if you are a Downton Abbey fan. (and if you're not, why not give it a try?)
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Keeps you guessing all the time!  I just don't want to put the book down.  Lots of suspense!  Good writing style.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game very addictive keeps you trying to beat your own score<br /><br />Lots of fun trying<br />Gets faster every time<br />Love that it's free to play
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I love the quality of the movie. The product was completely new. I think the Price is a Little high but I have to pay to enjoy the contents. I recommend this movie to any person who loves science fiction and futurist movies.
B000FGGE68|5.0|Great DVD quality and Milla Jovovich misbehaves and it is a great movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Character development above average with a strong plot.  Perfect for that long plane flight or a rainy night with a good scotch.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|It came on the exact day it said it would in perfect condition.<br /><br />Merlin season 5 is another amazing installment of the already wonderful series. Everyone will love this because it's great, cry because it's the end and hate that there won't be anymore.<br /><br />Everyone will love this.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|If you like Big Bang Theory, this may be the best season of all...the episodes are all funny.  If you are going to buy just one season, this is the one to get
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever.... I am very competitive so I like the fact that I can log into my Facebook and play against my Facebook. If you like temple run you would love subway surfer....
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This is an excellent title that has been updated to use touch controls. It works very well on the 8.9 fire. A rather high price for a mobile game, but totally justified in this case. I have gotten my money's worth on this game and still haven't competed it. I really hope this is successful enough to convince square and Amazon to bring more similar titles to the Kindle App store!
B009NX409M|2.0|This movie as a real let-down.  It didn't have a real plot and although it touched the emotions the interest level was just not there
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I didn't finish this book.  I just couldn't get into it. There just wasn't anything to keep me interested in it.
B000001Y16|3.0|Every song on the cd was scratched. I was not pleased this was purchased as a gift to my husband.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I read Man's Search For Meaning as a young graduate student in psychology.  I just read it again after 35 years as a psychotherapist and because I am a survivor of the 2004 tsunami in Thailand where I witnessed the devastation and death of thousands including my fifteen year old adopted daughter. Eight years have passed since the tsunami and I have personally practiced making the choice each day to find meaning in my suffering,from not only the impact of that Natural Disaster and death of a loved one, but meaning in the challenge of taking responsibility for my attitude every single moment. My husband speaks of the loss of naïveté and works very hard to replace that loss with love.
1451627297|5.0|I thought this was awesome. It isn't all-out horror like his early works, but there are many twists and turns in King's world and this was a great visit. If you're familiar with his other stories, you'll recognize a few people in this one; if you've never read anything by King before, definitely give this one a try.<br /><br />Well-developed characters, as I've come to expect with Stephen King, keep this story moving from the present to the past and back again. It's as much a love story as it is a time-travel piece, which surprised me, but I was left breathless at the end of the book. I highly recommend this to anyone in search of an excellent read.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I couldn't even finish watching this due to poor streaming. Amazon get your stuff together!  I expect more, after being charges to watch this movie.
1416905014|4.0|It's a good pop-up book with vibrant colors and lots of pop-up scenes. The only quibble I have is that some of the pop-ups don't work like they should. It's a good idea, when giving pop-up books as a gift, to test-drive the book before giving to the recipient. I unstick parts that get caught, try to re-crease where appropriate, etc., to get the pop-ups to display at full effect, in an effort to make sure the magic isn't lost when the recipient (a child, in my case) opens the book for the first time.
0810970686|5.0|This book and the second one I purchased  them according to the wish of my son which he still reading and he fed me always that he injoyed  too much
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I've been a fan of Les Mis since high school, and even though I've seen it on stage twice, I have to admit the movie blew me away. I bought this CD for my mother for Mother's Day. The actors did a fantastic job, and I would highly recommend this recording.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If your a fan of temple run then you'll love this. I personally think its better temple run 1 or 2 and the reason is because every time you update the game its usually because there is a new map to play on, and the abilities in the game are so much better then the ones on temple run and the many characters they have just surpasses the ones in temple run almost all the characters in the game have a special abilitily of there own it also has good graphics that are quite enjoyable. so in conclusion I give this game a 5/5 stare rating du to the fact that is have a lot more features that I personally think are way better then temple run.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|But before I saw it I thought it would be intense horror. I guess the British scare easily because this type of horror is nothing to Americans. The plot was weak, the town scared to death of this woman, no one tried to fight back except Harry who wasted his time risking to life going under muddy swamps to remove the dead body of the Woman in Black's son to reunited his body with the body of his mother. In the end Harry and his son were both hit by a train thanks to the Woman in Black. The movie was lame and the townspeople were cowardly and didnt bother to leave the town.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this bible app, it is having many versions, but i like very much the KJV version, it is easy to read
0887306667|5.0|The content and organization of this and companion books demonstrates conclusively that the authors are not only accompished authors but practitioners of the craft.  Succinct, memorable, direct, to the point, useful as a repeated reference.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved reading this book because it was so inspiring and I admired Harold's determination to continue walking even though it was getting too daunting at the end. I would recommend it to everyone to read.
B00881PPTO|1.0|only sells single bed rooms, could not find an option to search for anything other than what they want foist upon you. useless if you need two beds like when traveling with grown children.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved the trilogy both times I have read them and can not wait to read the rest of the books.
0307950689|3.0|Dan Brown is one of those authors whose hero jumps in and saves the world at the last minute. We saw it in the DiVinci Code, a fantasy loosely based on a previous diatribe, Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln's Holy Blood, Holy Grail for which they sued Brown with the case being thrown outta court and both Brown and the trio selling a lot more of their books. Then, we saw it again in Angels and Demons. Here, once again we meet the professor of Symbology, Robert Langdon this time tangled up with a bunch of Masons who are involved with the CIA, the cops and a nutcase Uebermensch villain. The story is end-to-end madcap action and frustration with twists and turns as only a good yarn-spinner like Brown can do.<br /><br />Aside from a new toybox of symbols to play with and a change of faces of villains and sidekicks, the same story told to us in his two previous Langdon adventures is served up again on a different platter. Pure fantasy? Of course. That's why we buy fiction. Same story? Yep. But that's OK. There are hundreds of ways to make spaghetti and I nearly always like spaghetti.<br /><br />Brown takes great liberty with his symbology and for an anthropologist, linguist and mythologist, I can get a little impatient with his fast and loose handling of the tools and concepts that are the stock of my trade and profession but I keep buying his books.<br /><br />So, I guess that makes us both winners.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like subway surfers it is a awesome game and I can have a really good time playing the game.
B001F4UHGC|4.0|This is a good movie specially if you enjoy a good car chase.  Steve Mcqueen does a great job in this movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love, Love, Love this show.  Can't wait to finish the end of this series.  Savoring every moment of it.  It is so interesting even my husband is hooked.
B002361MLA|5.0|I'm a very skeptical person and most people that know me would be surprised that I even read this book. The basic principle underlying this book is amazingly effective.  The simple trick presented to stop your mind chatter is worth the price of the book alone.  There's a lot for anyone to learn from this book and most of it is novel (at least to a mainstream reader such as myself).  I don't necessarily believe/understand a lot of the second order concepts in the book (Being = god, etc), however I do find myself relating to many of the situations the author presents and had already personally experienced several of the things he describes and explains.  I wouldn't consider myself \\"present\\" enough to dispute any of the author's more fantastical claims.  Regardless, applying the fundamental concept \\"works.\\"
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great quality, full of battles, lots of fun to watch on our TV.  Our family had great fun watching the DVD.  I am sure we will watch it over and over......  I would highly recommend this to anyone that has not converted to Blue Ray, this works for me.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|If you like the show you will like the movie.  The movie completes the series with some changes to make it unique.
B008G59IKO|2.0|I like classic Green Day, I like American Idiot era Green Day, I like Broadway show Green Day. I LIKE GREEN DAY! But I don't like this. Uno! Dos! Tre! are all just......boring. Similar sounding songs and a lack of any standout singles makes for just boring albums. I hope they come back with stronger, I really do, because this is disapointing.

B006P0FICE|4.0|Absurd in places, but great adventure.  New it would be silly in spots, but if you can overlook the air-ships, an excellent light-hearted entertainment.
B00024I2Z4|2.0|It was ok for first hour then disc skips last 15 minutes I can not watch it I cleaned it still having trouble lost packing slips
B00AZKCU7G|2.0|I'm very disappointed because the DVD sleeve amazon sent me has tears in the cardboard protection and the tabs to help the case close are broken. The movie is great though, and it's a shame the case is damaged because my pleasure is very incomplete.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|The Misremembered Man had a good story but just too slow a read for me.  It was filled with too much descriptions and many moments that really weren't needed.  I liked how the story came together but just again too much in between to keep my interest.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in politics.  It was a real eye-opener about the cooperation between past and sitting presidents.  Very well done and extremely interesting.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I'm a young guy, born into the Next Generation, generation. But you can't go wrong with William Shatner, and these movies, especially in Blu Ray, are great fun to watch. Wish they would find even just a cameo in these new movies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book because the movie was coming out, but I also wanted to read it because I like Nicholas Sparks. He didn't disappoint on this one. It has a touchy subject that needs to be addressed and I felt like he did a really good job with explaining everything. I haven't watched the movie yet because the book is SO good, I don't want the movie to leave a bad taste in  my mouth.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this game to challenge my brain a bit more, seeing that there weren't many other games --aside from tetris  --that could do so and tetris is frustrating to play on the kindle. fun, addicting, and last for hours.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Having just finished this book I'll start by saying I don't fully understand the vast negative comments associated with this book. While I agree the book takes on a very different approach than the previous three novels, I strongly feel that it was a calmly worded compliment to a series that I had deemed fast-paced and hard to set aside. The title spoke for the entire tone of the book, and gave the reader ample time to clear their alliances with the old protagonists. At the same time, I couldn't help but notice how well the book guided me to form my own opinions and allegiances, and in a way that left me with just as many questions as answers.<br />That being said, I had my share of discrepancies, and most (but not all) occurred within the walls of King 's Landing. While I was more than happy to find I would get to read Cersie's POV, I found a lot of her story redundant and slightly out of character considering how well the previous  novels had done painting her complicated persona. Not to mention that Brienne's character wad played out from the first paragraph. If I know without doubt where Catalyn Stark 's children are, how can I be interested when she goes on a novel-long quest I already know is for naught? I feel like I'd rather just read about her leaving King 's Landing in the beginning and pick back up when she jumps into Jaime's tent in the fifth novel... Spoiler Alert...<br />It was still a fine novel. It just lacked the passionate characters.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book - best I've read all year. Highly recommended! The author did a wonderful job writing from the point of view of a 5 year old boy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I became a fan of Colleen Hoover after I read the Slammed books, so when this came out I was super excited. If you have read the previous two books, you should defiantly read this one. Normally I can guess where the book is going because they are pretty predictable, but this one keeps throwing curveballs until the very end. I could not put it down. I'm pretty sure I was laughing and crying throughout the whole book. A must read if you ask me. Well done Colleen Hoover!
0312380852|3.0|Overall I was somewhat disappointed with this book, although it does have some good illustrations of the basic techniques, and several projects that I like the look of. The dark monochromatic colors in many projects detract from it's ability as a teaching aid, even if they are appropriate for Victorian-inspired designs.<br /><br />The photography is excellent, clearly illustrating the sample pieces. My primary disappointment is that nearly all of the projects use a single color of thread. Of thirty projects, only two use more than one thread color for the main part of the macrame. For a novice to this art, it would have been extremely helpful to have more samples showing what it looks like if you use more than one color, and explaining how to go about swapping colors while knotting. Multiple colors in the examples  would also help to illustrate which cord is being knotted, better showing the structure of the pattern. Many of the projects use black or other dark colored thread and beads, making it hard to see the details of the knots. That's fine as a design decision, but not so good when trying to illustrate a technique.<br /><br />This book is a good introduction to the art of micro-macrame. Included are a fairly comprehensive discussion of thread and bead types, and instructions on how to make a padded clipboard to support your work. The variety of projects is okay, but includes a lot of unusual findings or found elements that would be hard to locate, such as very distinctive watch faces, or a long pressed glass bead that is used for the body of a butterfly design. Without these components, the project needs to be adapted, and there are no recommendations for substitutes. There are three different watch bands, and a bracelet that uses a rectangular component with bars on the sides like a watch face. I would have preferred one or two of those based on different types or shapes of central focus beads or components and not just watches. I also wish there were more attention paid to finishing on some of the projects. There are no photos of the backs of any of the pieces. The pins say to \\"glue a pin back to the back\\".<br /><br />So while this book will certainly teach you the basics, I believe it could have included different designs that would have more clearly illustrated the techniques. The huge color palette is what draws many of us to the fiber arts, and I feel that this book does not do full justice to the possibilities inherent in color, both as a design element and as a teaching aid.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was as great as everyone said, the fault in our stars is one to reread 100x. I am in love with Augustus and hazel and they have left a mark.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|So amazing! Just as addicting as the first season.  Doesn't follow the books as much as the first season, but still good.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|If you love Evangelion ,then you just cant miss this one! People will always find flaws on everything, but simply put, if you don't what it for some of the &#34;accuracy&#34; comments other reviewers say then you will be missing to see Evangelion as it has never been seen before!! It is stunning!! :)
B009LMTDL0|5.0|really really engaging book.A women's group i'm involved in chose this book ,and we are so glad that we did. Very uplifting and sets up personal challenges....i find myself leaning in more, and confidently so!!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It is so much fun and has amazing graphics! Great game for animal lovers :) 10 Stars from me! Beware because omgosh it is addictive..Highly recommended!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|LOVE!  Read most of the books, and the show is just as addicting.  The first season follows along fairly closely to the books, but if you are the type of person who wants it to follow exactly, you won't love it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I got immediately hooked on this after watching just one episode!! Nice effects, well acted and interesting. The story unfolds at a good pace to provide you with enough info to understand what is going on but at the same time keep you interested to know more. 100% recommended :)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|lovely movie, no problems playing the video. This made for a great Christmas present for the Fathers in my life (dad/brothers/cousins/uncles)
B008AWBQGW|5.0|DON'T YOU JUST LOVE SKYNYRD? THIS HAS TOP NOTCH SONGWRITING ON A PAR WITH &#34;GOD AND GUNS&#34;. THE SOUND IS GENUINE SKYNYRD. I'LL PLAY THIS ONE OVER AND OVER.
0345529057|5.0|Started watching the series on HBO and wanted to get into the books.  Flew through the first one and loved it
B001YV506S|5.0|“Seabiscuit” was my absolute favorite film of that year…the progression that you see from the prosperous 1920s into the Depression-era was beautifully done from the production design to the costumes to just the feel of the film. And the story was so inspirational and moving with Maguire, Bridges, and Cooper at the top of their game! Kudos also for the camerawork, editing, and direction of Gary Ross. My favorite quote came at the end and left me teary-eyed: “Y’ know, everyone thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him…but he fixed us, and in a way we fixed each other.” I don’t say this about many films, but this was an absolutely lovely film! and so much better than the interminable LOTR3 that won.  Worth having the blu-ray, though my personal favorite is the 2-disc Red Box DVD Edition...definitely for collectors who loved the film as much as I did.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I've been waiting to purchase this recording for a couple months. Justin does not disappoint on this album. Have had it on in my car for the past week.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|acting and storytelling. IMHO, Tommy Lee Jones is way too dang ugly to be on the big screen. On TV it was ok though.
B007V65R54|5.0|I have never read a book on statistics one tenth as interesting. This book challenges the way you think and actually improves your thinking process - something I don't think many books do. The interviews Silver obtained are fascinating - from the true story of how Kasparov lost to Deep Blue to the betting philosophy of America's foremost sports gambler. I can't stop recommending this book to my friends.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game very awesome just need to let the users do things without having to use energy to build things in the game.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|The French group M83 has composed a great music, very futuristic, wich is perfect for the movie Oblivion... sometimes gentle, sometimes nervous, rhythmic, I love it. It's like the film, I can't wait to buy the DVD.
1401201911|4.0|Subject line says everything succinctly.<br /><br />Personally, having grown up in the Lex Luthor as a businessman era of Superman lore it was amusing to see Lex back in his mad scientist days and then evolve into his more modern businessman persona.<br /><br />Truthfully, although an enjoyable read it could have benefit greatly from being more expansive (along the lines of say The Watchman for example).  There are a few dialogue and plot holes that could have been filled in with the extra length.  Fortunately neither the plotholes nor the dialogue discrepencies take much away from the overal story.
1592332803|5.0|This was my first vegan baking cookbook. I've tried many since then and I still go back to this one for almost all my recipes. Let my start by saying, this is not a health food cookbook; the author never intended it to be, and she says so at the beginning.  It is a compendium of incredibly delicious, decadent desserts. The recipes are easy to follow and the author gives the amount in both volume and weight which is wonderful.<br />Some standouts are the chocolate cake and the currant scones. I've served both to countless friends, family members, and coworkers and they are consistently blown away.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Why I chose this rating is because this book is a. lovely and adventurous book. It tells a tale that can both be fantasy and reality. I like the characters and how they journey together knowing that they were already perfect just the way they were.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending of this trilogy was everything I expected. I cried a little at some parts! I wish it wasn't the final book!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|It was everything that my husb hoped it would be.  He has no complaints.  He would  order this over again.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Only problem is that after just a few rooms, you can't go any further unless u either purchase it or rate the app for a sequel. Which is exactly what I'm doing now.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I wanted to get the DVDE as my old video tapes are going bad. Glad I did and can now watch in HD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So suspenseful! I just can not wait for the next book! Hope it's even better! It is  worth the money!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i  like it because u dont have to check on it everyday i have a busy scedule and cant always check on things
B00940XIGU|5.0|What's not to like about David Guetta??  It's a fun collection of songs, perfect for working out or running in the park.  I wish it was remixed, without the seeminly long pauses between tracks.
B00697RJDE|5.0|Love the book.  Love the stories.  Love that it comes with the cd so it's very easy to print the patterns. Hopefully when I'm done, I will love my quilt!
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|This is a nice set of DVD's of the original theatrical releases in one simple compact set. While the original packaging was a pain to open the slim DVD cases and cardboard slip case make for compact storage.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|Wow! Another winning book by Akash Karia. This is a book to be studied as it is full of public speaking wisdom for advanced and beginning speakers.  Akash discusses in detail not only how to develop rapport with your audience, not only how to make better PowerPoint slides, not only how to build credibility with your audience but also how to effectively use stories in your presentations.  Through examples, Akash inspires us to become more dynamic, engaging and effective speakers.  I would give this 160 page book 6 stars if I could.<br />Allan Kaufman, Distinguished Toastmaster, NoSweatSpeaking Coach,<br />Co-author of Presentation Truths Revealed: 101 Universal Principles to Propel Your Speaking Success. \\"Your Next Presentation Does Not Have to Make You Sweat!\\"
B006LSZECO|2.0|This could have been very good.  I liked the characters and the story line.  It is well written EXCEPT please, the language is lewd.
030759565X|5.0|Lots of yummy recipes to be tried and tested in this book and none of them have extensive ingredients lists or complicated methodologies. Just the way I like my cookbooks to be.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to making the baked ranchero eggs, spaghetti squash and black bean tacos, marbled pumpkin gingersnap tart, ratatouille sub and black bean ragout for starters. And, not, it's not a vegetarian cookbook - those are just the recipes that appealed to me the most! There's plenty in there for carnivores too...
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I love this movie. It is probably a bit long, but I like that when it has good substance.  It arrived in good time, good quality.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Great music.  There is no one like Tony Bennett.  The song selections are excellent and the arrangements good to great.
B004HXIZVC|2.0|Large variety of people and music to follow but not organized well. It would be better if it was categorized so you could go to a certain genre/catagory. The only way to know what you want is to scroll and listen to each one. Takes too much time. I found some cool new up coming bands from free downloads on amazon so I thought this might be interesting. Wasn't happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game,  everytime I turn on my kindle I start to play this game,  its very addicting!  I'm glad I got this for free and the monthly or so updates makes the app even better!!!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I have always loved this movie, however, for the first time, I am realizing it is pretty liberal for its day.  However, I try to ignore it, since it is a great movie.  I received this movie very quickly, I have no complaints about the seller, shipment, or quality.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|The performances are striking as should be expected and it is great to have the variety of performances on one DVD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game. Very addictive. I can't believe how awesome the graphics are. I play it on my Galaxy tablet and enjoy every minute. It's very easy to play.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Having read a few of Burroughs stories a long time back I went into this movie with some hesitation of how good can be. Afterall, Harry Potter was superb and skipped much in the books and changed things around (see Neville with the gilliweed instead of Dobby). I digress but this movie did the first book proud and I was extremely pleased with how it turned out. Taylor Kitsch played Mr. Carter superbly with a great blend of southern Virginia charm. This was a great Disney movie that hasn't been seen in a few years. A sequel definitely needs to be made and in fact just finish the books since you've already started the series. Otherwise, Disney and ABC need to jump off a cliff
B003W77SAS|5.0|Great Classic ELO! In my opinion one of their best albums to date. Takes me way back to the 70's and for recommend it to all.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|I have run my own businesses for years. I read these kinds of books to spark new thoughts and ideas and I got several winners for this book. Make sure you have a pen/paper handy to write down ideas as your going through the book!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Easy to play. Graphics are cool. I play it on my Galaxy tablet. Never had a problem. Very fun and addictive. Not hard to learn how to play.
B0063GORYU|4.0|For someone that wants to play a game that does not take a long time to play Spider is great.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|It has interested many and has given great amusement and details I cannot wait to read the next book  I recommend this for everyone
B00884GR0W|5.0|While this game deserves a 5 rating with all the endless hours of play and great work from the developers... As of yesterday my profile would no longer open. I had many hours added up and now its all gone!!! none of the profiles even show. What happened and why does it send me to dropbox???
B00422LESO|3.0|Everything about this premise appeals to me, but the story lacks all of the depth that Austen's books are famous for. The characters aren't like able (except perhaps Jane), the detail is thin, and it's ultimately unsatisfying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best minecraft portable game in the store and I love  it and I hope every one likes It as much as I do.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Riveting book and quite a page turner.  Helps the reader to understand the Steve Jobs mystique and what drove his passion.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This story, Book, Movie has so much truth in it.  It is very uncomfortable if one thanks about how bad a government and how rotten people can get with out a working government.<br />Each day man can get up to a new day in a country where there is true freedom, in a country where freedom is kept from some, it is a prison every day.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Good but predictable.  It was hard to get in to but picked up toward the end.  Not Grisham`s best book.
1451695187|5.0|Awesome..absolutely a must read book.  a brilliant doctor received proof of heaven. truly inspiring.. you want to share this book
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I already owned this application, it quit working, as soon as I bought it again it started working.  Now I have two of the same applications, both working so far.  It's a shame you have to keep buying the same game over and over just to get it to work.  The game is great if you can keep it working.
0525952926|4.0|It is a good book, not as good as the first one in this trilogy,  it is a bit soapy (for women's eyes only) and I expected more here. But that is me. On average it is not that bad and you have to read it to finish the novel, hopefully the third one will not bring disappointments.
1932100660|5.0|Very thought provoking and well written.  definitely check out this book if you care about your health. I liked it.
0545128285|5.0|I love this book. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommond it to all Potter fans. The book that Prefessor Dumbledor willed to Hermenie. A great read!!!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It was a very good read with adventure and lots of politeness and some evil here and there. It was a tad quick in some scenes and felt rushed but overall good.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Would like to watch the rest but all of a sudden it wanted to charge me for each episode. Don't want to pay for it, that is why I purchased the Prime membership.
B001W2F730|5.0|I had this as a vinyl I bought in France back at the end of the 1970s. I love it even more now, especially the acoustical stuff. It's true that in general if Neil does it, I love it, pretty subjective, but the point I want to make here is that if you love Neil Young, you'll definitely love this album.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I really like this movie. All of the new Bonds with Daniel Craig are very well made with a fast pace action story that I can really injoy.
1451695195|1.0|While this is a reasonably well-written book, one has to suspend all knowledge of science and the brain in order to accept what it is putting forth.  I flipped every page, mind-boggled that  this man was actually a neurosurgeon.  Did he not learn about dimethyltryptamine, the brain chemical released as the brain loses oxygen and produces lucid hallucinations?  Some people experience a white light, some people see God or Jesus, or, in the case of my grandfather, aliens.  Yes, my grandfather was \\"abducted by aliens\\" during his NDE, and you can't convince him otherwise.  He even wrote several books about his experience, but everyone laughs at him.  Why didn't he get a book deal?<br /><br />All in all, if you are inclined to believe in the afterlife, that's what you're going to see in your NDE.  That's all this guy's experience is.<br /><br />If you're a Christian who has limited knowledge of science and the workings of the brain, or don't care to know about the workings of the brain, you should enjoy this book.  Personally, I couldn't finish reading it, and oddly, the local Library in our highly Christian community refused to take it as a donation.
0375826742|5.0|can't wait for the next book. I feel like it took some elements from LOTR and others from star wars, but this is a great relaxing read for everyone above high school reading level
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been using wireless mice from Best Buy for the last 4-5 years. Going through batteries on a regular basis was becoming rather inconvenient (dying while in game). I figured it was time to get a gaming mouse, as I mostly play games when I am on the computer. After looking at a lot of the different mice out there, I was pretty set on getting a Razer product. Then I found this mouse, after reading the other reviews and seeing the price, I decided to give this mouse a shot. I've never been happier with a mouse. Having the ability to switch DPI settings in a second, with the click of a button, has made gaming a lot easier. I've already started seeing an increase in my own personal gaming abilities (K/D improvements, etc.). The mouse itself has a great design and is very comfortable. I haven't downloaded the software to customize the mouse yet, but will be doing so soon.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|\\"Iron Man 3\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man is pitted against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to a question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?<br /><br />The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (excellent as usual as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper Potts), Don Cheadle (as Colonel James Rhodes), Guy Pearce (as Aldrich Killian) & Ben Kingsley (as The Mandarin) is excellent. The directing by Shane Black (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the comic books by Stan Lee (who also executive produced), Jack Kirby, Don Heck & Larry Lieber) by Black & Drew Pearce is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Brian Tyler is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is excellent. The film editing by Peter S. Elliot & Jeffrey Ford is excellent. The casting by Sarah Finn is excellent. The production design by Bill Brzeski is excellent. The art direction by Second Chan, John Eaves, Alan Hook, Desma Murphy, Jay Pelissier & Brian Stultz is excellent. The set decoration by Danielle Berman, set designs by Brian Baker, David Moreau, Alex McCarroll & Timothy M. Earls, set dressings by Mark Bankins, Scott Edward Collins, Brendon Crigler, Amy Graham, Beejay Grob, Scott Johnson, Eric Luling, Gordon McVay, Matt Mizell, Jennifer Raneri, Nathalie Rhodes & Jason Williamson is excellent. The costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent. The special make-up effects by Michael Spatola is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Alec Muradian & supervised by Daniel Sudick is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Beverly Abbott, Karina Benesh, Siobhan Bentley, Ryan Gaul, Monika Gosch, Niki Hillier, Daniel Kepler, Dave Kim, Mike Kolin, James Ledwell, Matthew Lloyd, David Masure-Bosco, Isabell Mayrhofer, Chris McLeod, Oliver Palmer, Allison Paul, Mark Sum, Patrick Timmermann, Ed Walters & Derek Weil, supervised by Matt Aitken, Mark Bakowski, Alessandro Cioffi, Vincent Cirelli, Sheena Duggal, Bryan Grill, Jamie Hallett, Venti Hristova, Simon Maddison, Erik Nash, Stephen Pepper, Darren Poe, Saravanan Stalin, Simon Stanley-Clamp, Christopher Townsend, Stephan Trojansky & Guy Williams is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Jeff Habberstad, Mark Rounthwaite & Mike Justus, fights coordinated by Eric Oram & Philip J Silvera is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie and follow-up to the first two \\"Iron Man\\" movies, landing in between the first \\"Iron Man\\" and ahead of the last \\"Iron Man\\". It is also an interesting follow-up, somewhat, to \\"The Avengers\\". This is also a well-made, well-done film that is entertaining, thematically and visually. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as usual as his fifth run as Tony Stark / Iron Man. Shane Black is an interesting replacement as director for Jon Favreau, who returns as executive producer and also as Happy Hogan. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, thus far, also an excellent movie to start the summer season off on, and also one of the best movies of the year, thus far, as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game of Solitaire! You can choose a left or right hand lay out. You can choose your backgrounds and card designs as well. As you play, if you need to change your mind about a move you can do so. so easily without a penalty of any kind. You can also get hints to see if. there are any moves possible that you can't seem to find. Including using cards from the &quot;build on Aces stacks&quot;; anything that will help you to continue on. Hopefully on to a successfully completed Solitaire game.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game it's the only game I play anymore. I have recommended this game to all of my friends.they say that they love it as well.
B00A4AI0AS|4.0|I purchased this set mainly to obtain the electrifying 1960 performance of the Brahms Violin Concerto with David Oistrakh. One of Klemperer's pinnacle achievements, this classic reading has been re-issued a number of times over the past several decades. Unfortunately, the out of print CDs are commanding ever-heftier prices, and EMI's latest budget series offers the recording only in MP3 format. You can call me old-fashioned--I came of age collecting LPs along with the odd cassette back in the `70s, and have built a collection of well over 1,000 classical CD albums since the mid-`80s--but I still prefer physical media. The idea of getting my music from something called a \\"cloud\\" simply doesn't inspire a great deal of confidence. Nor does it engage the senses or nourish nostalgia--elements as essential to my enjoyment of listening and collecting as my composerly understanding of musical structure, or an often-too-acute sensitivity to the subtleties of intonation and ensemble.  The bottom line is this; if you want the Brahms on DISC at a REASONABLE PRICE, this may well be your last chance.<br /><br />Released in 2013, this attractive box set offers a mixed bag of Klemperer collaborations. The sound quality is consistently excellent throughout, even if the performances themselves run a rather steep gamut from Oistrakh's brilliantly inspired, lyrical and passionate  Brahms, to a laughably torpid Beethoven Violin Concerto with an uncharacteristically lackluster Yehudi Menuhin. To be sure, there is a good deal of perfectly fine music-making in between; the Schumann and Liszt Piano Concerti with Annie Fischer are spot on, and the complete Beethoven Piano Concerti recorded in 1967 with a young Daniel Barenboim range from serviceable to very good in the case of the \\"Emperor\\" and the Choral Fantasy. (Admittedly, my benchmark for the Beethoven has been Murray Perahia with Bernard Haitink and the Concertgebouw on Sony.)<br /><br />Klemperer's approach to Mozart seems positivelyschizophrenic. The set features delightful, spritely renditions of the four horn concerti with Alan Civil (1960), along with a massive, heavy-handed performance of the K 503 Piano Concerto (#25), again with Barenboim. There seems to be a generational disconnect in this collaboration; the approach, by today's more intimate, chamberistic standards, seems, at best, wildly over the top; at worst, oppressively atavistic.  (I've always favored Perahia's self-led performances with the English Chamber Orchestra on CBS/Sony, which strikes me as a perfect balance of scale and style.)<br /><br />Here's a rundown of set contents:<br /><br />DISC 1: Mozart; 4 Horn Concertos (Alan Civil) (1960): Liszt; Piano Concerto #1 (Annie Fischer) (recorded in two sessions between 1960 and 1962)<br /><br />DISC 2: Mozart Piano Concerto #25 in C Major K 503 (Daniel Barenboim/New Philharmonia) (1967):  Beethoven Violin Concerto in D Op. 61 (Yehudi Menuhin), (recorded over four days in January, 1966)<br /><br />DISC 3-4-5: Beethoven Piano Concerti and Choral Fantasy Op 80 (Daniel Barenboim/John Aldis Choir/New Philharmonia) (recorded in October and November, 1967)<br /><br />DISC 6: Schumann Piano Concerto in a minor Op. 54 (Annie Fischer; New Philharmonia) (recorded between May, 1960 and August, 1962): Brahms Violin Concerto in D Op. 77 (David Oistrakh; Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française) (recorded in Paris, June 1960))<br /><br />Long-time collectors will probably decide whether or not to buy the set based on how much of this material they already have. EMI's recent series of economically priced boxes makes it easy to fill in gaps in serious collections while allowing for fresh reappraisal of Klemperer's rich and sometimes-controversial legacy. The present set is recommended for its treasures, if not for its quirks.
B0011EP0S6|5.0|This movie was very entertaining as a slow paced mayhappenstance love story with an alternative ending you don't see in more movies. It is a melancholy presentation leading your heart to want them to succeed...<br /><br />The movie has music integrated into it but is far from any musical I have ever seen. It may be a bit slow for some people who have short attention spans and lack the ability to stay with the plot line. If you are uncultured in the way of foreign mild Irish accents you may have a hard time understanding the dialogue in parts. It is a cute Sunday movie I would suggest you watch with your romantic partner.

B006ID6NDQ|5.0|This book reminds us of the power of the human survival spirit.  It read like a novel, but the story was told rather &#34;matter-of-fact&#34; in many ways.  It was not exaggerated, romanticized or glamorized in any way. This was a time in history that when you look back, it was astonishing what people did in order to survive.  What keeps someone going forward in times of true horror ...what motivates the human spirit to continue to be hopeful...how does one remain strong in mind when their body is deteriorating...there are so many questions.  The book was excellent.  The story was riveting.  The time in history - dismal - dark and dreadful.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|This is awesome! I have the lens hood for my larger lens but the smaller 18-55mm did not come with one (on my camera) so I ordered this. It snaps into place just like my larger one which is exactly what I wanted. I read some reviews for other lens caps and there were concerns about screwing them to the lens and damaging it. This one fits perfect and is easy to get on and off and flips around for easy storage. I'll never take it off the lens.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After the strange twist that Catching Fire delivered, I had low hopes for the third book in the series. It took me about half a year to get it I'm glad I didn't finish after the second one. I finished it in four sittings since it flows wonderfully and has no annoying slow moments. I didn't care much for the love triangle, not from the very beginning in The Hunger Games, Katniss' character is practically what kept me wanting to read more.<br /><br />I appreaciate the re-employment of the &#34;publicity-presentation-TV-reality show-violence&#34; formula that seemed a bit stale in the previous book. This time it is much more cleverly used - Katniss is used in military propaganda TV shots which need her to be all beautiful and well-dressed. The brutality of the war exceeds any expectations and the pretty graphic violence is unlike anything else in the previous books.<br /><br />The overall idea how people in power abuse &#34;celebrities&#34; to control the crowd and the uselessness of an individual in a war is what resonated in me as I finished the last pages. I got so much more than what I expected when I started reading the very first sentences of The Hunger Games. Well done, Mrs. Collins, well done.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is something of a cult classic, I was introduced by a family member several years ago, and have since brought other people into the Catan fold (like some sort of ridiculously fun pyramid scheme). But you will be hard pressed to find a better investment as far as board games go. This game is very fun, challenging with the right crowd, and has immense replay value do to the variable board setup (you put a new board together every game, it's very simple, though). The various expansion packs and 5-6 player extensions make it a game that you can play several times a week for months, even years at a time.<br /><br />I've taught family members as young as 9 to play proficiently, but maybe the ideal age is mid teens. It's also worth noting that the original game is probably funnest with 3 players, it gets a little cramped on the board with 4. But the 5-6 player expansion is cheap and is a great way to bring more people in on the fun.<br /><br />Can't find a better board game on the market. Buy immediately.
