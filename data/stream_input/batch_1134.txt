B0041KKYBA|5.0|...or there were be Wall Street bankers hanging from lamp-posts, crowds in the streets demanding the imprisonment of the politicians who sold the US away for . It's a sickening look at how greed and malfeasance won the day leaving the country poorer, but certainly no wiser. (I've paused now for a time, and am coming back to this...) What more is there to say? The cliche, if you're not angry (horrified, outraged, etc.) you're just not paying attention. And it's easy to pay attention, just watch this film.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Amidst the insane hype of vampire movies, books and television shows, Vampire Diaries is a stand-out in my opinion. The plotline is gripping, with more twists and turns than a roller coaster; the cast is adequate, if not stellar (although I am a bit critical of most young actors and actresses); and the overall feel of the show never fails to inspire the kind of \\"What could possibly happen next?\\" questions I love to ask myself and others.   The mythology isn't completely original, but there are some fresh spins on popular vampire lore, such as the magic rings that allow vampires to walk in sunlight. (And the fact that these vampires don't sparkle is all the better for my tastes.) While based on L.J. Smith's book series from the '90s, the show is far from loyal to the novels, which, while irksome for some fans, I'm sure, is, to me, a big improvement. (Yes, I read the books, so I know what I'm talking about.)   All in all, I find The Vampire Diaries to be an interesting, entertaining mixture of horror, action, suspense, and, of course, romance.
B004K4IZ54|3.0|The sound was great but the 3D was not very good as is the case with most of the home 3D movies I have seen. The movie companies better start doing a better job or home 3d won't be around very long.
B000008HZB|5.0|arm chair theatre is one of those special discs that seem to never be out of style. there may be only certain times of the year when it sounds  best but it's really a classic. he was at the height of his powers in performance and production skills at this point. stormy weather and the rockabilly  song  \\"don't let go\\" probably are a result of his connection with george . i feel fortunate in my life to have lived when steven  speilberg made films and jeff lynne made some of the great music of my life.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|Are you fan of Basil Rathborne's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes? The clean cut, sharp dressed, stoic individual? Then...this film probably isn't for you.  If you are however, a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes stories this move is for you.  Like many I was a bit worried when I heard that Guy Richie was the director of this film, but...he succeeded beyond my expectations.  He took Holmes back to his roots as someone that wasn't afraid to get into fights, got melancholy and did drugs when he didn't have cases (yes he really did do this in the books), and have a slightly supernatural feel to the movie, but still grounded in reality.  It's classic Holmes and Robert Downey Jr. played him expertly.  Jude Law was a great companion and together the two provided an absolutely entertaining, thrill a minute movie.  You can't go wrong with this movie....I just wish they had a two disc version of the film with some special features :)
1433523922|5.0|For many years I read through the One Year Bible.  This year I wanted to learn more about the word and it's history.  The ESV Study Bible has been a big help.  The study notes provide a deeper understanding of God's word.  Also the large print makes it easier to read.  It is probably not the bible you want to carry to church each week since it is big and heavy.  But, it is a great tool to learn more.  Also included was an online edition which allows me to read online when I travel.  Definitely a good investment.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This is a slightly edited review, as I have now had a few days with this album, and yes, I've listened to it quite a few times. It's striking how much you can see the FF, and Dave Grohl, have grown as artists. Their ability to craft a tight, full sound with impossible-to-resist rock-n-roll hooks is better than ever, and it was never bad. Dave Grohl's lyrics have matured as well, bringing both edginess and depth. I was a bit smitten with the album when I wrote the title to this review the first night I heard it, but I'm going to have to stick with it, because it is, after all, perfectly true from my perspective.<br /><br />And it's recorded on all-analog equipment in Dave's garage, which adds a whole other level of awesome.<br /><br />Bridge Burning: sorry, didn't feel this one. Perhaps the picky intro picked at my psyche a little too annoyingly. Good hard rocking tune but ... meh. Not my favorite.<br /><br />Rope: Early single release for a reason -- one of those things that instantly becomes an ear worm, with catchy melodic hard hooks. Enjoy.<br /><br />Dear Rosemary: According to the interwebs (a Google search for \\"Dave Grohl\\" plus Rosemary), Rosemary Carroll [believed] that Kurt might have been murdered. She was Courtney's divorce lawyer. The lyrics almost suggest it's connected, but have a Google and see what you find. \\"Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie.\\" hmmmm....<br /><br />White Limo: Not my favorite track, definitely balls-to-the-wall rock, yes, but ... well, YMMV.<br /><br />Arlandria: Arlandria is a town in Virginia, which features a Dave Grohl quote on their website. Arlandria was mentioned in a previous FF song, Headwires - this is, apparently, an intense place. Classic Foo Fighters power chord poetry, what can I say? Oh, sweet Virginia.<br /><br />These Days: best existential thing that's ever rocked me to my core. I can't tell you how this song will affect you, you'll have to meditate with it for yourself. It will be worth the effort.<br /><br />Back & Forth: Since my first listen happened to be inadvertently in alphabetical order, \\"is it all this good\\" was my reaction. (hint: it is) Powerful r&r hooks and Dave Grohl writing words that simply defy gravity. Over the hill and through the ages...<br /><br />A Matter of Time:  Powerful and it would make a perfect anthem for personal change. Put this on your workout playlist, definitely.<br /><br />Miss The Misery: Opens up with hard, heavy, crunchy melodic rock & roll riff, i.e. it's a Foo Fighters song. This is lyrical stuff here, get literate with it and listen to every. single. word. You will find the album's title in here, meaningful & poignant. Also, it will ROCK you when you find it.<br /><br />I Should Have Known: haunting, dragging up memories, bliss + agony, perfect like faded photographs ... beautiful if sadness can be considered to have beauty, which I think it does.<br /><br />Walk: Reflective, brilliant, shiny, melancholy, and will rock you, seriously. Another one to add to that workout playlist, it'll get you moving. Classic Foo Fighters, what can I say?<br /><br />SUMMARY: this album, like several others in my 50 year history, has changed my life. Great albums do that. This is one of them. I don't mind that Kurt Cobain's ghost haunts Dave, in fact I think it's given him cause to explore some great darknesses and come out on the other side with some unforgettable music.vertently in alphabetical order, \\"is it all this good\\" was my reaction.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I hesitated purchasing this book because I don't care for memoirs.  However, I took a chance simply because this was written by Tina Fey.      She did not disappoint.  I cruised through this book in only three nights.  I have a toddler and a school age child, so I have very little time to read.  I chose the book over sleep.  For me?  That's a big thing.      She is a true talent.  I also appreciated that she never once said anything negative about a single person throughout this whole book.  If you're looking for \\"dirt\\", you won't get it here.  Thank goodness.  What a distraction it would have been.
B004INNRFK|5.0|David Foster can tell at a glance if someone will be a star.   If he picks you, you will be a star!  This CD/DVD is a fine collection of great Stars.  His newest is Jackie Evancho and she is just out of this world.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|This first season is first-class scripted entertainment.  Every episode not only has the standard procedural story in the foreground, but there are several backstories progressing simultaneously for all the characters involved.  Without giving away too much, I'll tell you this: the writers are absolutely stellar, and the actors bring their characters to vivid life in magical filmmaking by an obviously accomplished crew.  Along the way, you'll learn a few tips to keep from being conned in real life, like how pick-pockets operate in a crowd, for example.    The episodes also include interesting references to art, history, and such else.  There is none of the gory stuff that you'd see in a crime drama of the CSI: persuasion, and the language is very clean unless some character is actually intended to drive you to a particular conclusion.  In other words, it's a classic blue-skies show.    The overarching story follows four lead characters (suave con Neal Caffrey played brilliantly by Matthew Bomer, FBI Agent Peter Burker played equally smoothly by Tim DeKay, Mrs. Elizabeth Burke played by Tiffani Thiessen, and genius con Mozzie played by Willie Garson), and three recurring characters (Agent Diana Berrigan played by Marsha Thomason, Neal's landlady June played by Diahann Carroll, and Agent Clinton Jones played by Sharif Atkins).  An assortment of guest stars make up each individual episode, which covers one crime at a time.    The Blu-Ray has no differences from the DVD except for high-definition video, though.  Which is somewhat counter-intuitive, since the network takes substantial pains to publicize this show online (including commentaries, creator's notes, promos, interviews, etc.), which could have easily been included here.  Probably explains the reported lukewarm reception to the Blu-Ray release.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|Not much of a story, but fun to watch, nonetheless:<br /><br />This film possesses the elements I generally look for in a film.  Gorgeous girls, and in this case, hot young girls dressed in scantily clad fighting gear and even just tangible scraps of clothing that could pass for military uniforms.  They did quite well at keeping it all \\"sexy-looking.\\"  And I like cool, dark world visuals.  So, babes and dark dystopian landscapes are two strong elements I seek in a film.  Sometimes, I really don't care if there is little to no real story.  This film is basically ALL about eye-candy!<br /><br />After I've watched this, I try to look at this film as how the original concept was perceived.  I have to think that somebody who's really creative at fabricating graphic, very detailed, dark worlds and over-the-top fighting scenes in these fantasy worlds, had concocted a few pre-conceived five minute visuals designed by computer graphics (of course) and then they had to figure out how to write a story to put these various unrelated fantasy scenes together to make a movie somehow.<br /><br />As a story, this was really lame.  Very empty.  Directionless. This could not possibly be an interesting book, even if they included a few pictures.  So, that alone, should tell you that there is no real story here.  Just great artwork brought to life.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  I like films that have cool visuals, and this film has many.<br /><br />Parents should have no problem allowing their children (even as young as 10) to watch this film.  There are no real bloody scenes, and no fowl language.  I respect the makers of this film for making this film a treat for a family audience of all ages.<br /><br />I noticed in the movie trailer that they used Led Zeppelin's \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" as background music.  Perhaps that was to attract an older audience.  Well, that did capture my interest, for sure.  But, in the movie, they used Bjork's \\"Army of Me\\" which has a similar rhythm and beat.  But, that song is cool too.<br /><br />Yeah, I'll get the Blu-Ray when this film comes available for release.  It makes for a great background movie to have on, whether I choose to actually sit down and watch it, or not.<br /><br />If you like \\"babefest\\" films with girls fighting, check out \\"D.O.A.

Hardly any. Semi-stimulating stories are diminishing.  Dramas are directed more towards the female audience anymore, so all that's left for me to enjoy in any new film is if it looks cool on the screen, and if it is not too offensive.  I don't need blood, guts, and gore to be entertained.  And today's idea of comedy, is just too stupid.  Comedies today try too hard to be funny and so it fails to be, to me.  The situation comedy of film seems to have faded away, these days.  Making parodies of past films seems to be the goal of today's comedies, and it all just stinks.<br /><br />But, with all that said, this quirky film, with the girls, and the graphic detailed artwork, apparently works for me.

B00000I07R|4.0|Bon Jovi released their fifth album &#34;Keep The Faith&#34; in 1992. This was Bon Jovi's first of the new decade, and featured some of the most mature sounding songs Bon Jovi ever recorded. It took me a while to actually get into this album, but once I did, I really enjoy this baby.<br /><br />&#34;Keep The Faith&#34; found Bon Jovi shedding a lot of their party-boy image and chosing to adopt a more 90's inspired sound and image. Now, they didn't go all grunge (i'm looking at you Warrant and Danger Danger), but they weren't singing about partying and sex too much anymore. Even minus the former song content, this album is almost perfect from start to finish. Tracks like &#34;Dry County,&#34; &#34;Blame It on the Love of Rock & Roll,&#34; &#34;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,&#34; &#34;If I Was Your Mother&#34; and &#34;Woman In Love,&#34; are all favorites for sure, but every track could have been released to radio back in the day.<br /><br />&#34;Keep The Faith&#34; takes Bon Jovi's sound a little more in the mature direction that would be fully realized with their next record &#34;These Days,&#34; but it still has just enough to make melodic rock fans rejoice.
006113399X|5.0|A difficult start but a must read as this book sets the tone to all the rest of Jo Nesbo books,which in my opinion ,should be read in sequence,the Redbreast moves from the present time,well the 90's ,to the second world war.All Jo Nesbo books move at a cracking pace,most with un-expected endings,a fine author
B00000I07Q|5.0|I'll be quite honest about this record, I truely thought that after \\"Slippery When Wet\\" Bon Jovi would have nothing left in the tank. I was wrong about that, and Bon Jovi released a decent follow-up for sure. While it's not on par with \\"Slippery When Wet,\\" it's not a bad offering from these guys.<br /><br />\\"New Jersey\\" was an absolute monster of a record for Bon Jovi, spanwing hit after hit, and even garnering two more number one singles, with \\"Bad Medicine\\" and \\"I'll Be There For You.\\" This record also solidified Bon Jovi as a force to be reckoned with in the future. \\"New Jersey\\" is a straight-forward pop metal record, which isn't surprising considering it was released in 1989. The entire album is listenable throughout, however, I found there was more filler on this release than their previous outing. My favorite tracks from the album are \\"Born To Be My Baby,\\" \\"Bad Medicine,\\" \\"Blood On Blood,\\" and \\"Living In Sin.\\"<br /><br />I'll admit i'm not the biggest Bon Jovi fan around, but they really had some decent records in the 80's and early 90's, and they should be part of any melodic rock fans collection till this day! I suggest you go buy this record now and enjoy some serious (or not so serious) melodic rock music.
B001JRB16U|5.0|There's no need to write another review of this splendid film.  This is only to wonder at the one part of the film and all the commentary on the 40th anniversary edition that confuses me: the film takes place in England, but the audiotronic bird shown in one scene is the American robin, a thrush, and similar to the English robin only in color, not species.  OK, the film was for American audiences, no problem with that -- but there is no mention in any of the commentary about the discrepancy.  The only thing said about the robin -- besides the audiotronic information -- is that male robins don't sing!  I believe that is totally incorrect, for the American thrush called robin, as well as for the English robin.  (I'll watch this space for a correction from any ornithologists out there...)

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|Foo Fighters have two distinct styles and the only thing separating the two is whether the guitars being played are acoustic or electric.<br /><br />From their stunning debut to 2007's \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace,\\" Foo Fighters have cranked out consistent garage rock with just enough remaining elements of '90s grunge to keep Dave Grohl's fans from the Nirvana years still wanting more. When \\"Skin and Bones\\" was released in 2006, however, Foo Fighters proved, like Nirvana and Alice in Chains before them, that their music, while frequently heavy, translates well for acoustic versions. Sure, there was always the occasional acoustic track on their previous albums, but \\"Skin and Bones\\" shoved the band's softer side in everyone's faces, adding a new dimension to Foo Fighters.<br /><br />Although Foo Fighters' acoustic tracks have been popular, for most fans, Foo Fighters' crowning achievement is \\"The Colour and the Shape;\\" 1997's classic that includes the timeless \\"Everlong.\\" Although much more polished than many of the rock albums hitting shelves in the late '90s, \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" was an energy-filler, no holding back rock & roll album. Every album since has held glimpses of that style, but never quite lived up to the hype created by their sophomore record.<br /><br />Now, 14 years later and nearly 20 years after the release of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" Foo Fighters have finally brought things back to that classic grunge style. Recorded on analog tape in Grohl's garage studio, even the recording process was left unpolished and \\"raw.\\" They even asked Butch Vig to oversee the production, just as he did on \\"Nevermind.\\"<br /><br />A metallic guitar riff gradually builds before a fury of snare drum hits for the opening of \\"Bridge Burning,\\" the lead track on \\"Wasting Light.\\" Dave Grohl may be screaming \\"these are my famous last words,\\" but \\"Wasting Light\\" is a rejuvenation for the band.<br /><br />As if Butch Vig wasn't enough, \\"Wasting Light\\" brings back more old friends in Pat Smear and Krist Novoselic, both of Nirvana fame, for the track \\"I Should Have Known.\\" \\"Rope\\" may have been billed as the first single, but \\"I Should Have Known\\" stands with the very best of Foo Fighters' material.<br /><br />\\"Wasting Light\\" blends Foo Fighters' early energy and heavy riffs with their later insightful songwriting. The result is their best album to date. Foo Fighters may not have broken any new ground, but they still took chances by turning back the clock. Fans both new and old will love what they hear.

0061726826|4.0|To be completely honest, I feel the cover of the book is lacking.  There is such an intense story in the pages of this book.  I believe the cover could have been much better and even incorporated some fantastic story elements.  I understand I may be showing a glimmer of my shallow side when I say this, but I probably wouldn't have read this book without winning it.  I know, I know... and I don't judge a book by it's cover alone, but it IS the first thing that grabs my attention, and Delirium's cover just doesn't do that for me.<br /><br />The first half of the book seemed very slow to me.  To be fair,  this is the first dystopian novel I have read, which I'm sure attributed to the \\"slow\\" feeling that I had.  I also understand there is a ton of information necessary when building a dystopian world.  The first 200 pages or so contained everything that we need to know in order to understand who Lena is and what her world is all about, so although I felt it was slow, I also agree that it was necessary.<br /><br />Once I reached the middle of the book, the pace picked up and Delirium became much more interesting for me.  Lena starts taking risks and dealing with inner struggles.  Alex is introduced and things start happening.  After the half-way point, I honestly didn't want to put the book down.  I loved that the novel is written in first person, also.  That point of view puts the reader directly into Lena's head and allows us to really feel what's going on.  The further I got into the book, the more drawn in I was.  Once I hit that half way point, there was no stopping.  I had to finish, and when I did.... oy.<br /><br />When I first announced on Twitter that I had won the ARC of Delirium, I was warned by friends to have the kleenex ready.  They were so right.  Ms. Oliver, I understand why.  I do.  Your ending made one amazing story!  BUT... the romantic in me still has to ask WHY???  There had to be another way! lol<br /><br />All things considered, Delirium is a phenomenal read and I highly recommend it for anyone!mmend it for anyone!
B000FC10MU|5.0|This is the first Neil Gaiman novel I've read, which shows you how slow I am. I first became aware of his writing while reading a comment by the Query Shark on her site.<br /><br />I was struck by the similarity between his writing and that of Stephen King's in the Dark Tower series. It had me wondering who had influenced whom.<br /><br />Shadow, the unwitting protagonist in American Gods, held me captive throughout the novel. His method of handling adversity is a lesson for all mankind, though I hope no one has to endure the trials and tribulations of this main character.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman's writing style and application of his extensive vocabulary assure that I will continue to read his stories, if only as a lesson in writing.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|When I first heard of \\"The Walking Dead\\" I wasn't too sure about. I love a good zombie flick, and so I thought I would give this mini-series a try. I didn't catch it on AMC so I purchased the Blu Ray version. After watching the first episode I was hooked...it captivated me almost immediately. I continued to watch episode after episode and couldn't stop until I was finished. It was created/directed by the same man who brought us classics like Shawshank Redemption (one of my all time favorites), The Green Mile, and The Mist. How can you go wrong with that? I highly recommend this to anybody who is a zombie fan or who just wants a good, captivating show to watch. 10/10 Stars in my book!

B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is one of the best releases in home video history. All the films look and sound great in high definition (especially Alien and Aliens: yowza!), the menus are very accessible and eye-pleasing and the packaging is very stylish and more durable than I thought. And then there is the supplemental material which is staggering to say the least. Arguably anything that was released in previous DVD or laserdisc editions have been ported over (some if not most in hd!) and it's very easy to access whatever material you're looking for, especially with the interactive Mu-Th-Ur mode. The enchancement pods (brief featurettes) add even more info for every film. The previously censored Alien 3 documentary (Wreckage and Rage) is presented here uncut with more footage and candid moments from David Fincher. Speaking of which, the special edition cut of Alien 3 is improved in the scenes with bad or no audio - the actors were brought back for dubbing work and the rough cut plays better now. The film scores for all films are archived here, along with some unreleased cuts here and there. You will get your money's worth with this set but I'm gleefully warning you: it's overwhelming.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album is exactly what I've waited for from the Foo Fighters ever since One by One (say what you will bout that album, I love it). Don't get me wrong I love and appreciate all of the Foo's albums, Dave is a legendary songwriter, but this album has that raw rock energy I've been waiting for and expecting from them since I first heard One by One and The Colour and The Shape. This is the quintessential Foo Fighters sound that may have been forgotten since their early days.    I was really worried about this album from a pre-release overexposure of the album stand point that I wouldn't enjoy the album when I bought it because there were no new surprises to enjoy. But when I popped the cd (yes CD,  it's sounds better) into my car stereo and Bridge Burning started playing, it just blared out of the speakers and into my ears like it was the first time I heard those notes. I was so happy with what I was hearing it brought me to a tear (I never have gotten that emotional on a \\"first\\" listen). Even Rope sounded new to me with the crisp guitar crunch sound.    This would have to be arguably their best album next to The Colour and The Shape (at least best all around album since then). It's so hard to pick out certain songs without leaving out others. At first glance I'd have to say Bridge Burning, White Limo, These Days, I Should Have Known, and Walk are the tracks that'll live on. But there isn't one bad track, I even thought Back & Forth would be the black sheep of the group but it holds it own. It reminds of the poppy sound the Foo's created with DOA but still has the hard driving guitars. Bridge Burning is probably my favorite song right now. It just has everything I was wanting from them, a big sounding anthem that just rocks your face off. Having White Limo been the first full song I heard, I was so floored when I heard and my expectation were set high (besides what was already being said bout the album). White Limo is just that song you want to drive in your car withyour friends and just rock out (ala Waynes World). It captures the early days of the Foo Fighters perfectly with that Weenie Beenie and Podunk sound of distorted vocals. These Days is just a phenomenal anti-love song talking bout an emotional break up, same goes for I Should Have Known (which many may think it's about Dave's Nirvana days). Walk is a great ballad that's about not being ready for death and second chances.    As I mentioned before, I bought this album as CD, not on iTunes. I recommend buying it as CD just because it sounds better, the packaging is awesome AND you get a little piece of the actual master tape. I want to say this about the cover art, at first I wasn't all that thrilled about it when it was first unveiled because it didn't have that iconic Foo Fighters look you'd expect. But I knew there was something cool they were trying to do with the art for this album just by looking at the cover for the Rope single. It's not until you look at the booklet that you really get the sense of it all. It's just awesome to look at. Yes the cover has been done before (most notably The Beatles' Revolver) but part of the idea of it is to draw from the old school, which the album is all about.    This album can be summed up as Dave's (hell even the Foo Fighters) legacy album. Not in the sense that this is what will (but could) define them years later, but that's what this album is about for them as a band. It's a reflection on their early days, doing everything the old fashioned way, bringing in their rock hero's and people from the past to make this record. If Dave Grohl were to have a mid-life crisis this would be his expression of it, taking a look back at his career and try to recapture his youth and to say/prove to the  fans \\"I still have it in me for a while longer\\".
0374290024|4.0|For over a decade analysts and futurists have said that the 21st century may be known as \\"The Pacific Century.\\" The Pacific Rim, according to this view, will most likely be the economic, cultural and political leader for many decades ahead--with China, Japan and eventually India as the leading world economies, California as the increasingly influential leader of the United States, and Asian military might rather than NATO as the focal-point of global power sometime around the year 2050. From this perspective, the 20th century with its Euro-centric battles between fascism, communism and capitalism was the \\"Atlantic Century\\"--dominated by European powers and the American Eastern seaboard.<br /><br />A recent book by Ian Morris, Why the West Rules--For Now, puts a new twist on the common wisdom. In fact, after reading Morris, I am left quite unconvinced that the years from 2050 to 2100 will be dominated by the Pacific Rim at all. It could just as easily be led by resurgent Atlantic alliances or a rise of the southern half of the globe or some other nation or alliance.<br /><br />The future is not as sure as the experts sometimes think, Morris shows. Numerous things can bring major changes that drastically alter the commonly held view of what will most likely come. As much as we debate about what happened in history, how can we possibly have a clear or shared view of things ahead?<br /><br />Morris introduces what he calls, \\"...a `Morris Theorem,' (expanding an idea of the great science fiction writer Robert Heinlein) to explain the entire course of history--that change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people (who rarely know what they're doing) looking for easier, more profitable and safer ways to do things...<br /><br />\\"We have seen people constantly tinkering, making their lives easier or richer or struggling to hold on to what they already have as circumstances change, and, in the process, gently nudging social development upward. Yet none of the great transformations in social development--the origins of agriculture, the rise of cities and states, the creation of different kinds of empires, the industrial revolution--was a matter of mere tinkering; each was the result of desperate times calling for desperate measures\\" (p. 559).<br /><br />In short, it is not current trends that create our future so much as challenges which have yet to occur--and, of course, it is impossible to predict what all such challenges will be. Current events are, in this view, simply the ongoing responses to past challenges. But challenges often surprise us, and it is the surprising challenges which change society the most because we are unprepared for them. When we are forced to make major adjustments in order to overcome unexpected crisis, society changes in ways impossible to predict.<br /><br />At the macro level, I'm convinced that there are two major ways to respond to crises: 1) with increased freedom and belief in the ability of individuals, families and communities to adapt and succeed, or 2) with decreased initiative, innovation and independence and instead more dependence on experts, government and big institutions as the \\"saviors\\" of the regular people. Since the Great Depression and World War II, the trend has been toward the second approach.<br /><br />We may be witnessing a rebirth of the first attitude, evidenced by everything from the increased popularity of whole foods and holistic health, non-traditional education where parents take a bigger role, independents and tea parties in politics, to the \\"Arab Spring\\" which is revolutionizing the Middle East. The rise of the Internet may have catalyzed this shift, if in fact such a change is occurring.<br /><br />The future is influenced by many factors--some predictable, some not. Tocqueville's studies and travels led him to foretell, in the 1830s, that the future world would split between nations supporting the United States and those backing Russia, and that the two sides would engage in a long conflict. He said that if the contest was decided by military might Russia would win, but if determined by economic prowess the victor would be the United States. Other long-term predictors have shown that current trends can tell us much about what's ahead. Winston Churchill suggested that we can use history itself to effectively foretell; Morris seems to concur.<br /><br />In 1776 Adam Smith accurately forecast the coming rise of the West over the Orient. He believed that Britain, as a \\"nation of shopkeepers,\\" was poised to spread its entrepreneurial power across the globe. Smith said that though China was an example of wealth and power, it wouldn't last. \\"The Chinese, in short, were stuck,\\" writes Morris. \\"'The competition of the labourers and the interests of the masters,' Smith predicted, `would soon reduce them to the lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity,' with the consequence that `the poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far surpasses that of the most beggarly nations in Europe...'\\" (p. 40).<br /><br />The problem, as Smith pointed out, is that China \\"...had already acquired `that full complement of riches which the measure of its laws and institutions permits it to acquire'\\" (pp. 39-40). If the laws and government don't allow entrepreneurship, innovation, adaptation or growth, a nation must either change its laws and government or face the consequences.<br /><br />History and trends can teach us a lot about potential futures. One lesson is that when entrepreneurship is unleashed, economic prosperity and political power follow (see, for example, Morris's thoughts on pp. 11-12, 19-21; see also The Mainspring of Human Progress by Henry Grady Weaver). Find the nations where entrepreneurship is most encouraged by society, and a good bet is that they're on the path to leadership. Even where unpredictable things occur, it is the innovative spirit of entrepreneurialism which is most likely to overcome challenges with the least difficulty or lost time.<br /><br />In times of crises, leaders should know that the second priority is to deal wisely and effectively with the immediate emergency. The third priority is to find ways to drastically unleash entrepreneurship. The first priority, which to be truly effective must be applied before a crisis comes, is to establish a culture and system where entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial values are widely encouraged for the long haul. Then when calamity hits, there are numerous entities empowered and ready to take action under government direction and/or support.<br />Note that such free enterprise is different than mere capitalism: the first gives freedom and opportunity to all, the latter gives special legal benefits to the wealthy and limits what others can do.<br /><br />Another rule of history is that crises will come. Change happens. To be prepared, it is best to have an entrepreneurial-minded people full of initiative, innovation, resiliency, ingenuity, and self-starting leadership. No government program can cause this, but bad government policies can discourage it.<br /><br />That said, it does not seem easy right now to imagine a resurgent \\"Atlantic Century\\" any time soon. Nor does Morris suggest such a course. Still, stranger things have happened. The future, like the past, belongs to the societies where entrepreneurial innovation flourishes. Government can help or hurt this, and in so doing it has drastic influence on the future. Morris doesn't say all of this in his long and detailed book, but it is worth reading for its in-depth analysis of the broad waves of human history.<br /><br />In the tradition of greats like Jared Diamond, Paul Kennedy, Samuel P. Huntington and Joseph S. Nye, Morris teaches numerous principles of history that are vitally important in our time. Morris is right that a knowledge of history helps prepare us for the future, and he quotes Churchill to strengthen this point: \\"The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see\\" (p. 30).<br /><br />We are a nation ill-versed in history, and this can only have a negative impact on the future of freedom. In a time where people worry about China, India, the Middle East and other parts of the world, and about their direct impact on the economy and politics of the West, we can't afford to remain uninformed. Why the West Rules--for Now is not an easy read, but it is an important one. Ten, twenty and seventy years from now, some nation or region will be the world leader. With so much widespread concern right now about America's decline, those who care about the future of freedom should read and ponder Morris's book.iority is to deal wisely and effectively with the immediate emergency.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|Last Summer I saw the preview to this and said that looks amazing. Then December came and it critics were amazed by it and Natalie Portman was the Oscar buzz. This only added to my need to see this movie. I went into this with very high expectations and was not let down. The movie plays out very slowly in the complete mind of Nina who after a while you realize she isn't the best narrator. The movie is directed by Darren Aronofsky who also directed a companion piece to Black Swan (The Wrestler) another brilliant character study. The Script had been thought of for over 10 years, and both the director and Portman have been on the project since then. The Acting is breathtaking. I was rooting for Natalie as she rightfully won the Oscar, she made a very complex character who is very fragile. All Supporting was very good as well Milia Kunis has been stunning me for quite a while and has a bright career ahead. The Direction was perfect, the camera is always on Natalie always dancing with her. It really helps get you into the character even more. The movie plays out like a mind-trip the further into the movie you go the less sure of anything that happens. The last 30 minutes of the movie electrified me, as the credits appeared I sat there taking in the whole thing and immediately wanted to re watch it. This movie is my favorite movie of last year and deserves your attention. A+

031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards has lived in his own universe since his teens; as guitarist for the Rolling Stones, he's managed to not only become one of the defining guitarists of our lifetimes, he's also become such an out-sized personality that even those folks that don't really care about rock and roll know who he (and Mick Jagger) is. His exploits are the stuff of legend, his excesses and abuses would have destroyed dozens of men, and somewhere along the way he's had a hand in writing some of the last century's greatest rock and roll riffs.<br /><br />You'd think with all that abuse, there wouldn't be much of his brain left to store all those memories. But big surprise. Not only does he play the steel strings like madman, he has a mind like a steel bear trap. Unlike Eric Clapton's biography that seemed to just be passage of passage of \\"I formed a band, we got wasted and recorded songs and I don't remember much,\\" Richards manages to pull great amounts of detail from the entirety of his life, along with co-writer James Fox. Richards' ego is as loud as his guitar and \\"Life\\" puts all on full exhibit. It's interesting, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and often not very complimentary. While there are times I was wanting for more details (like the passing of Brian Jones, for example), Richards doesn't gloss the issue away. This includes his many brushes with law enforcement and some of the notorious trials, like the Toronto bust that almost took him down.<br /><br />He also minces no words when it comes to his fellow Stones. Ronnie Wood takes his knocks, there's plenty of anecdotal - and mostly complimentary - stories about Charlie Watts, but plenty of savaging of Mick. Richards' defends Jagger as a brotherly relationship, and that anyone else knocking Mick should be ready for Keith to \\"slit their throat.\\" On the other hand, there's an awful lot of direct hits on his bandmate, including one rather physically descriptive comment that will give you reason to wonder about why Mick insisted on the giant inflatable weenie was part of the Stones' '72 tour.<br /><br />While I highly recommend this book, Richard's seems to be running out of interest in the last few years of his life. The final two chapters burn through the 80's on in near abbreviated manner, which may not matter much to folks who think that everything from \\"Steel Wheels\\" on was ultimately forgettable. He skims through it all in surprisingly brisk fashion. Regardless, \\"Life\\" is a terrific rock and roll book.ant inflatable weenie was part of the Stones' '72 tour.

B003R0LBVW|2.0|Freedom is the story of Patty and Walter Bergland, suburbanites living in St. Paul, Minnesota with their two teenage children, Joey and Jessica. Their life is not even close to as perfect as it seems to outsiders. Patty is depressed and dissatisfied with her life with Walter. As part of her therapy, Patty writes her autobiography, detailing the sexual assault she suffered in high school and her life in college as a star athlete where she met Walter and his best friend Richard the rock star. The Walter/Patty/Richard love triangle starts in college and continues throughout the rest of their lives in the book.<br /><br />This book was a chore to get through. All of the characters had such bleak lives with no fun or happiness in them at all. I don't mind reading about characters with sad lives but I found it unrealistic that every character in this book had basically joyless lives and no redeeming qualities. I also found the political messages in the book very heavy handed even though I agreed with most of them. The flow of the story was interrupted with editorial style political commentary.<br /><br />I really liked The Corrections when I read it nine years ago so I had high hopes for Freedom. Unfortunately, it just didn't measure up.

I watched the movie, and enjoyed it so much, that I also read the book.Twice... My hat's off to Nicole Conn for the storyline. A very talented lady indeed..I think it was beautifully portrayed by both Traci and Necar. Also have seen Claire of the Moon, also by Nicole. Also a very good movie. Little Man is next. Then A Prefect Ending.. Nicole and Marina, Keep up the good work you do. Not every story out there is full of truth, but this one is, because it's the story of Nicole and Marina. Much Love to you ladies, and Job very well done..I hope everyone watches Elena Undone. Buy a copy today, well worth watching over and over...
B004G600A4|5.0|This has become one of our favorite shows to watch.  Our daughters 2 and 4 yrs old sat and watched this show multiple times.  They laughed at all the funny scenes.  Our two year old loves when Pascal gives the raspberry to Rapunzel and our four year old loves when Rapunzel uses her frying pan. They also enjoy many other scenes.  This should become a Disney classic over time.  It was well made for younger as well as older children.  Sometimes the scary scenes are too much for our young girls, as in The Princess & the Frog (they still likes that show, but not as much).  At our house...Sleeping Beauty watch out...you may have competition :-)

B004LWZW24|4.0|Wow...the team of James Wan, Leigh Winell, and Oren Pelli are awesome here! The makers of Paranormal Activity and Saw do very well with this great horror film. It's pg-13, but it works here. No blood, gore, torture porn stuff to be found anywhere! The torture is all psychological...a thinking person's horror film. The musical score is excellent....pretty original...not that teen slasher cheesy long chase music. LOL! I really appreciate the old school \\"less is more\\" approach that the first part of the film provides. Extremely atmospheric and the tension is sometimes unbearable. Then...comes the second part. We have the comic relief of the two paranormal investigators (one is the writer, Mr. Winell). Thankfully, their boss (Lynn Shaye) is dead serious. I LOVE that woman! A lot of ppl seem turned off by the explanation about the projection, but I thought it was very original and it took me by suprise. This movie is the first movie I have seen that deals with that stuff. And I'm interesting in OBE; even got a beginner's book on it. Well, after seeing this movie, I shall burn the book! LOL..j/k. I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 because the final scenes were cheesy with the Night of the Living Dead demons bursing into the house like they did. And that one last twist....lol...typical hollywood \\"sequal?\\" ending. And then there's Darth Maul...this time with hooves and a tail...and a snake like flicking tounge. He was VERY scary in this movie as the main demon, but couldn't the makers have been more original and not insult George Lucas like that? Granted, they did Maul justice by giving him a truly evil presence in this movie, but I would've prefered a completely original monster.<br /><br />In conclusion, Insidious is a slow burning atmospheric horror flick suitable for teens and above. Plenty of jump scares, great tension throughout, excellent music, descent acting, and truly terrifying imagery. Just don't except the second half to live up to what the first half promises. This is no Paranormal Activity, which I gave 5 stars all the way!s is no Paranormal Activity, which I gave 5 stars all the way!

B004SQS9FA|5.0|I don't really know what people expect out of Radiohead.  They do something a little different and a little new with every album.  Sure, not all of them are pleasing to such wide audiences like OK Computer, but regardless of what critics and mainstream fake fans say, every one of their albums are innovative.  Following suit, this album is moving, melodic, has great contributions from each band member and the subtle riffs and bass lines make this album an elite one.  Lotus Flower has already become one of my favorite Radiohead songs of all time and I've been a fan from the start.  I've heard others complain that it's too short with 8 songs but in fact it comes out to 37 minutes of pure and incredible music, no \\"fitter happier\\" to suffer through each time you want to get through the entire album.  In Rainbows was great and I was curious how this album would turn out, and fortunately, it's freaking incredible.
193413712X|4.0|It looked like a little novella I could finish in an afternoon, and turned out not be so.  Tinkers takes a bit of focus and perseverance, and cannot be breezed through like so many books its size.  The story jumps from character to character and runs back and forth through time.  I admit I had to keep turning the pages back to fully grasp and anchor myself in the events and the setting of the novel.  That said, reading Tinkers is worth taking the extra time and patience.  Some worthwhile pursuits require this.  It's how the central character, George, tinkers with his antique clocks as he repairs and perfects them, before he is struck down with the final illness that leads to the events of the novel, which begins by telling us that George will die in eight days.      Especially when we are still and practically alone with George, Harding's prose exhibits brilliant pacing and immediacy.  We lie there with George, dissecting the paintings in the living room where he lies on a hospital bed and talking to his grandson who holds vigil on the couch nearby.  We ride with George's father, Howard, pulled by a mule named Prince Edward, a wagon full of household supplies and sundries he sells on his route through the snowy Maine trails.  At times, however, the author uses his descriptive powers without enough restraint, and an image gets muddled one of two ways - so obscure or close to impossible that it's difficult to wrap one's head around, or so particular to the frame of reference that one stays on the outside of it, or the understanding of it.  I admit to losing the desire to go back through each tangent as the book went on, as Harding stepped into another generation of Crosbys and performing the jump through decades one time too many.     I can't recommend Tinkers to everyone, and although I admire the book, it pushes the amount of contemplation and staying in one place allotted for a story to move forward.  Not every book need be structured the same way and I feel Tinkers' value, as a meditation on death, loss, and the way families multiply and shift through generations, renders it beautiful, if sometimes slow in its execution.  Phrases knocked the wind out of me and made me stop reading, progress through the book interrupted as often by the dense and unconventional prose as my own reaction to what Harding's risks and ups and downs with it can accomplish.  Its most profound achievement, the way the reader can sink into the mind of George and Howard and watch them make realizations (for George, about his mortality, and for Howard, about the mysterious disease of his nimble mind) from up close and in a way that temporarily replaces your thoughts with those of another.  Harding can hook us and make us think, and I will be reading his next novel.

I almost gave them a \\"review\\", ha! Come to find out, my neighbors, who rarely check their mailbox in my apt complex, now apparent, have their own P.O. Box in town, so they finally brought it over to me last Friday, April 8th, apologizing. Not their fault! The order was Mar 11, expected to be here by the 14th! I can usually, ALWAYS count on Amazon orders to get to me promptly, so I was frustrated & worried, it was lost! It's my mail~delivery person's fault as she had a few other pieces of my mail, besides the cd in her hand! I was so excited to get the package ripped open & immediately download into my iTunes! Then took it out to my car & been listening intently, since!! I love this album & was very impressed the packaging was unscathed & looked perfect! The description was, it had a hold punched out, 'somewhere' but I couldn't find it! I'm very happy w/this album & the price was great! I would rather buy the album for the album art, versus easy downloading from here thru MP3! Thank you!!

0679736646|4.0|This is my 3rd PKD novel, and much like the others, they start out so slowly that it took me several tries to get past the first chapter without wanting to just put it back down.  It took a full 68 pages to get the story rolling to the point where it wasn't just utterly boring.  I guess it's like waiting for the LSD to kick in....the first few hours are just waiting for the full effects.<br /><br />Having read PKD a couple times previously, I found the book rather predictable, but after it got rolling, hard to put down.  I did have the ending pretty well pegged right from the start.  That's what dismayed me when I came to the end and was not at all surprised.  It was a typical Dick ending, and therefore predictable.  I can say that even with having my own precog ability to guess the ending, it was enjoyable.  I wonder how this would really work in a screen play.  I kept thinking about that the enitre way through the book...I just don't see it working.  I see a lot of Minority Report in there, and didn't much like the screen version of that either...mind numbingly dull and with someone else's interpretation that just didn't work.<br /><br />I can see where people want to say UBIK was God, and Jory seeming like the devil...or death...the way he \\"ate\\" people.  That was rather odd, and just like someone on acid may think up.  It's like he was on one bad acid trip the entire time he wrote the book....which is probably right.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I was afraid the backback style would be too small for my use--I'm a really big guy. The adjustible straps were plenty long enough for me. Overall I'm very pleased with the backpack but there are a couple of warnings. The top strap is not long enough to go over the handle of your roller luggage handle. Worse yet, after only 10 days of use the strap began to come apart from the body of the bag. The bungie straps on the back are useless because they are too weak to even hold a book. The little velcro fastened small pockets on the side are also non-functional because things fall out--so don't use them for anything.  On the plus side, it holds everything I need to put in it. The compartments are perfect. Padding is adequate. I love that it does NOT have the name of a camera on it and it looks like it might be holding books instead of my $3000 camera. Inside there are plenty of pockets to hold memory cards, notepads, and misc stuff.   I just wish more attention was paid to the construction so the straps didn't pull out of it so soon.
B004RUF9DC|4.0|This blu-ray version of \\"Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is  certainly not up to the level of \\"The Ten Commandments\\" as a visual experience. Among movies in the same general age group, what is? That being said, if you have only a 42-inch screen, as I do, this blu-ray is not bad for the price at which I purchased it from Amazon.  There were a couple of scenes near the end of the film  where the grain was very noticeable but this did not  last very long. The blu ray is a noticeable improvement over the DVD in many scenes, especially  when Lazarus is raised from the dead. I definitely saw  more distinct visual information, which greatly magnified the effect of this scene.  I have seen the DVD version at least twice in the last  year. I would not hesitate to buy this blu-ray again, though it is telling that Fox/MGM says they  used the best elements \\"available\\", not the best in  existence.  As for the carping about cameos of great stars ruining the picture, add up the screen time for John Wayne and Shelley Winters (who seem to engender the chief complaints). I'll bet you'll find that, where they are distinctly visible or actually speaking, it adds up to less than two minutes in a film over three hours long, even in the cut version.   George Stevens is an icon among directors. He did not become a fool overnight because he decided to make a picture about the life of Christ. He knew how to downplay the cameos, and to exact wonderful performances from virtual unknown(at the time) actors. This movie gets better  with age, and with subsequent viewing, as Stevens  apparently knew that it would.  I give it four stars because it has not been restored,  a restored version probably would have rated five in  my book. It is not a movie I would want to be without,  even on a less than perfect blu-ray.
B004SC7B6M|2.0|I love Within Temptation and have greatly enjoyed every album until this one.  My main complaint is that it's just sonically boring compared to past offerings.  Maybe they got too caught up in trying to tell the story and attention to the musical composition got shorted. In the past, there has always been a lot of interesting stuff going on dynamically.  But to me, most of the songs on The Unforgiving sound too generic and similar with nothing very unique or surprising in the compositions.  I have tickets to go see them in September and I'm really hoping that they are not planning to play the whole album at the show.  I miss the adventurous twists, turns, cliffs, and valleys of songs like, Mother Earth, Angels, and much of their previous work.  Other folks may like this album. I hope they do. But for me it is a 2 star disappointment.

0553381695|5.0|With 'A Clash of Kings' I figured out exactly what it is I'm enjoying so much about Martin's storytelling. The incredibly complex narrative is part of it; so many characters, some of whom shift in and out of the reader's awareness in such a way that you're never quite sure who might be important (which is part of the fun), make for a potent pageant. It's a little self-indulgent but I'm also digging how Martin describes characters, places and actions; everybody gets some kind of identity, no matter how minor they are, and every place gets some kind of description, without the narrative bogging down too much in florid, adjective-riddled prose. But most of all I think I have been - and continue to be - surprised by the rhythm of the writing. Energetic without being frantic, unflinchingly gruesome yet emotional, the writing in 'A Clash of Kings' is a genuine treat. Over-long books tend to irritate me, but I didn't for one second feel that this book was laborious, even when i was flipping through it to check maps or genealogical charts. I'm definitely as much invested in these characters as I have ever been in any literary ones of note, and feel I owe them to find out what happens to them.
B000PMG16U|1.0|Loved the real originals back in the late 70's, but then again how could you go wrong by remaking Akira Kurosawa's \\"Hidden Fortress\\" and set it in space?

0756404738|2.0|I enjoyed the first book in this series quite a bit and very much looked forward to this installment. Unfortunately.<br /><br />What felt like great drama and character building in volume 1 turned into inane dithering in volume 2. Over the course of a thousand odd pages, the storyline gets advanced by an almost negligible amount--so far as I am able to tell. I'm a fan of worldbuilding in fantasy, but each event seems to lead Kvothe on to some New Sidequest to the extent that I was reading frantically forward in the hopes that something, anything, vaguely relevant would happen. The section with the Mael is fascinating and then suddenly there's hundreds of pages of random sex training with a fae, a brief interesting point with a prophetic tree, and learning martial arts from the ubermensch (and yet strangely down syndrome-y) mercenary nation, and a thousand pages later, Kvothe has picked up a couple of skills and a few pieces of information that seem like they play into whatever's going to happen down the line.<br /><br />It may be that every single rambling subplot actually ties together in a really beautiful way and is *necessary,* but having finished it and thought about the volume, I still feel as if more than half the volume was tossed in because Mr. Rothfuss's editor (true story) refused to edit down his manuscript and Mr. Rothfuss (speculation) refused to cut out any passing idea.<br /><br />I actually do want to enjoy this book and will purchase the third volume to see if it manages to reach a satisfactory conclusion, but right now I'm frustrated because it seems like a promising author went insane and started writing meandering fanfiction and wasted a thousand pages of my time.
0756404738|5.0|I liked \\"The name of the Wind.\\" I really did. But there was something that kept me from loving it... I'm not sure what it was, maybe the monotony of the University life near the end or the lack of action or the constant grinding of Kvothe's struggle for money.<br /><br />On the other hand I absolutely love this book! It's like it took all the good things from the first one and cranked it up a notch. Not only do we learn a whole lot more about the entire world and it's history (especially the fae realm) but the characters are simply better, deeper and more developed. Kvothe is growing up and he finally starts acting like a proper hero instead of the poor orphan he was in the first book.<br /><br />Reading about his travels was also a lot more interesting. I dunno, maybe I just like travel books, but I really enjoyed his adventures. I highly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in fiction and coming-of-age stories.

0307272702|5.0|Taubes has thoroughly researched carbohydrate diets and their effect on the human body and he presents his findings based on convincing scientific evidence while writing in a manner accessible to non-scientists. I had a difficult time putting the book down and that is saying something for someone who usually does not get that excited about reading non-fiction. I feel that I have been in the dark until now about the true reasons we gain weight and why the low fat and/or low-calorie diets coupled with excercise have not worked for me and many others. I highly recommend this book, at least give it a try. You probably will be surprised. As the author notes in the book, a major paradigm shift or change in belief can be difficult, especially when conditioned with the wrong information for many years, but if you can open your mind and consider what he has to say, you may very well have a real opportunity to change your body as well and to regain your health. Many thanks to the author for publishing this book.

0061801313|5.0|My review will be about the books, not the box set itself. The box set is cool, nothing special, it contains the four books in paperback and that's pretty much it (I wish they could make a hardcover box set though). The books are totally amazing, the people who watch the T.V. show may find them kind of boring if they are looking more for the mystery part rather than drama. The first book is, in fact, the first chapter of the T.V. show! but once you get involved into the series you can't wait to read more. The books have many chapters, in which, normally, the principal characters never get to interact a lot between them, mostly focusing on the development of their secrets. The fourth book, Unbelievable, gives you and \\"unbelievable\\" ending, since you never expected something like that; a friend of mine ruined to me the series by telling me who was A and who killed Ali and stuff, but even like that, I was amazed by the way the first four books tell all the story. If you have the chance to buy it, do it, you won't regret it.

B004UVBXKQ|4.0|Imagine a cross between \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"Murder She Wrote,\\" set in a quaint Maine town where weird things happen every week.<br /><br />That's the best description I can come up with for \\"Haven,\\" a paranormal crime show very loosely adapted from Stephen King's novel \\"The Colorado Kid.\\" The first season starts off on a rather mediocre note with a string of one-off \\"troubles,\\" but slowly develops a mysterious arc that grows more intriguing and powerful as time passes.<br /><br />FBI agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is sent to the town of Haven to find an escaped murderer... but as soon as she arrives, she finds that the guy is dead... and his death was physically impossible.<br /><br />Not only does Haven have some bizarre people and strange weather patterns, but Audrey finds that she has a connection to the place -- an old photo with a woman who looks just like her. So she decides to stay in Haven, and partners up with local cop Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryan) to solve local crimes while she searches for hints to her past.<br /><br />However, it turns out that the \\"troubles\\" are returning to Haven after thirty-ish years -- mysterious aging, outbreaks of madness and sanity, spontaneously rotting food, horrible deaths related to artwork, a shadowy \\"Dark Man\\" (no, not the one Stephen King fans are thinking of!), a deadly shapeshifter, fiery deaths, a poltergeist and countless ground cracks.<br /><br />\\"Haven Season 1\\" takes a little time to bloom. At first the acting is stiff, the one-off plots are ordinary, and there's no strong overarcing plot except \\"the troubles are back!\\" But as time goes by, the stories get darker and the writing becomes more compelling -- especially since only some of the mysteries center around stuff you can arrest people for.<br /><br />Each episode introduces a new bizarre occurrence, and has Nathan and Audrey trying to unravel whose powers are going out of control. These mysteries are fairly clever, and there are some funny moments sprinkled in every episode (\\"I need a HUUUUUGG!\\"). And despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes. Eww.<br /><br />Emily Rose is kind of stiff in the first few episodes, but she becomes a really likable heroine by the halfway point of the series -- she's strong, compassionate, playful and has some shocking secrets of her own. Bryan plays Nathan as reclusive and quiet, mainly because he can't physically feel anything. And there are some solid side performances by Eric Balfour as a charming smuggler, Nicholas Campbell as the gruff sheriff, and Anne Caillon as Nathan's girlfriend.<br /><br />\\"Haven\\" hasn't fully unfolded into the great show it might become, but the first season shows it starting to really bloom -- and leaves you wanting more.despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes.

B003UESJHO|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Based on a true story, David O. Russell's \\"The Fighter\\" is a knockout sports drama filled with finely drawn characters and crackerjack performances.  The movie netted two of its actors - Christian Bale and Melissa Leo - a pair of richly deserved Best Supporting Oscars for their efforts.<br /><br />In the role he was clearly born to play, Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, a welterweight boxer who, after quite a few years in the ring already, is still trying to make a name for himself as a fighter.  Perhaps the greatest hindrances to Micky's success are his mother, Alice (Leo), and his older brother, Dicky (Bale), the former a hard-living, tough-talking broad who takes it upon herself to manage - and mismanage - her son's career, and the latter, a crack-addicted has-been pugilist himself whose one claim to fame is taking out Sugar Ray Leonard in a bout in 1978 (Leonard makes a brief appearance as himself in the film).  Now Micky is beginning to question whether he wouldn't be better off just cutting the family ties altogether and taking charge of his own affairs, especially when a well-reputed professional trainer offers to take him on as a client.  But how will that sit with a mother and a boatload of siblings who prize familial loyalty above all else?<br /><br />Set in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1993, \\"The Fighter\\" brings its low-income, working-class milieu to vivid life.  In addition to the thick Boston accents and mercilessly teased hair, \\"The Fighter\\" features what is probably the strangest, least \\"Hollywood\\" looking cast of secondary players I've ever seen in a mainstream movie.  This is particularly the case with the women cast to play Micky and Dicky's seven unmarried sisters, all apparently still living at home, who serve as a kind of roving posse, eager to avenge any slights made against the family honor by outside forces, including Micky's highly opinionated new girlfriend, the tough-as-nails bartender Charlene (the superb Amy Adams), who isn't about to back down from this band of screeching white-trash banshees when it comes to doing what she thinks is best for Micky.<br /><br />So dazzled are we by the riveting, award-winning performances of Bale and Leo that Wahlberg's beautifully understated work as Micky could easily get lost in the shadows.  But it is he who gives the movie its emotional center, turning Micky into a character whose fate and welfare we come to care deeply about.  If nothing else, his subtle, self-effacing way of coping with all the craziness and drama taking place around him provides a necessary counterweight to the showier performances - and immediately puts us in his corner.  It also helps that Micky is being torn in so many different directions at once, when all he really wants is to finally get a chance at a title bout.  Jack McGee, the roly-poly fire chief from \\"Rescue Me,\\" also scores as Micky's tirelessly supportive father, George.<br /><br />There's a definite toughness and a take-no-prisoners mentality to this clan, but also a closeness and a strangely admirable loyalty among its members that go a long way towards smoothing out some of those rougher edges.  They're not necessarily people one would want to meet or have much to do with in real life, but as characters in a drama, they sure are fascinating to watch.wn from this band of screeching white-trash banshees when it comes to doing what she thinks is best for Micky.

0810994739|5.0|My daughter is late to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid bandwagon, it's April of 2011 now & she just finished book #2, but she said all the kids in her class are reading them (3rd grade).      We rented the movie a few weeks ago & the whole family enjoyed watching it.  The \\"Get off me baby hippo!\\" remark had all of us laughing out loud. Yeah, Loded Diaper is a bit much & yes, Greg does lie & do some things he should not do.  BUT, just because a child watches or reads about such acts doesn't mean they will decide to do them.  It is a parent's responsibility to teach their children morals & not shelter them their entire life.      Back to the book, I think it only took her 4 days to read both books #1 & #2.  She enjoys the format of the books with the easy to read text & the funny drawings too.      She is also reading book #5 in the Guardians of Ga'Hoole series & reads some girly books like Horseland & Rainbow Magic Fairies too for a well-rounded book reading experience.  :0)

B004SIP88Y|4.0|In recent years, Zhang Yimou has been creating some truly epic movies -- expansive, lushly opulent action films with a heavy dose of tragedy and romance. And before he even created \\"House of Flying Daggers,\\" Yimou created \\"Hero\\" -- visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, \\"Hero\\" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: \\"Broken Sword\\", \\"Flying Snow\\" and \\"Long Sky\\" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen respectively). And lest they get close to him, everyone is kept at a far distance and the King is surrounded by armed guards.<br /><br />Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them, and is actually permitted to sit within a certain distance of the King. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses sexual divisions and jealousy, calligraphy (yes, calligraphy), and his wits to defeat all three assassins in turn.<br /><br />But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own that also explains Nameless' actions and choices. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind the hero's story?<br /><br />Despite having been released much later, \\"Hero\\" was apparently the first of Yimou's wuxia action movies -- and while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. And perhaps most uniquely, it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic \\"Rashomon,\\" by having the King and Nameless provide wildly different versions of the same story. What is the truth? It turns out to be far more complex than even those involved would have thought.<br /><br />And Yimou's wire-fu creates a film where style and fantasy overcomes the realistic, full of lush color and swirling action scenes. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. And the fight scenes are, simply put, balletic -- they fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen autumn leaves.<br /><br />As exquisite as the action seems, it would be empty without a suitable plot to go with it -- and while deceptively simple, Yimou's storyline is actually rather complex emotionally. There's a passionate romance that is splintering apart, personal rivalry, and the whole question of what the titular character's plans are, and what he ultimately chooses to do. The one flaw is that I'm not sure why he makes the decision he does -- it seems rather out of left field.<br /><br />Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors -- as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, as the mistress of one of the men -- are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity, tragic romance and briliant skills.<br /><br />Rich, visually entrancing and crammed with powerful emotions, \\"Hero\\" is one movie that won't leave your memory anytime soon.far more complex than even those involved would have thought.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I watched the film \\"Back & Forth\\" this past Saturday, because nothing else was on, and found it engrossing.  I, of course, was familiar with the band and certain songs but never much of a fan.  I had `My Hero' and `Everlong' on my iPod and that was it.  But after hearing more of their music I decided to check out their albums.  Long story short, I bought them all on Sunday and have not stopped listening to them.  And, of course, I downloaded 'Wasting Light' this morning and I am blown away - it is a great rock album, tons of guitars, garage band sensibility, great harmony, great beat, driving rhythm, and Bob Mould from Husker Du fame.  Have to say `Wasting Light' has pushed Probot aside as being my favorite work by Dave Grohl.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I haven't been this happy with a record in what feels like years. This record is a tour de force and, hands down, the Foos' best work. Everything from the opening riff of Bridge Burning to learning to Walk again drips of polish and unbridled rock 'n roll. The fact that this was recorded to tape just adds to the value. Dave and the band have come a long way from the awkward stage they hit the limelight in & for the first time since The Colour And The Shape, they've completely outdone themselves. Bravo. 5 stars.
0446563048|5.0|I was lost - simply lost. This book captured my attention for two straight days. As I read I was wondering if it is a fiction or a real story of Tony. He captures your attention with amazing story of himself right from his childhood to present. We travel with him from his young days-middle school-teenage-college-work-personal life. The first thing I did as I read the book(I didn't even finish it) was to tell everyone I met to read this book. You will see how a single man transformed as he grew and also transformed a loss making company into a profitable one in 10 years. It has all the spice,tension,suspense that fiction book would have :). For every guy who ever wanted to be a self-made business man this is the book to start with. It gives you hope and a smile that anything can be possible with dedication and the right values. I loved the part where he just packs up and goes for a hike in Kilimanjaro when zappos was almost about to be closed. All in all an amazing ready and a must buy.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|Spartacus: Gods of the Arena begins strong and ends amazing. I enjoyed this miniseries to the fullest extent. I must say I wish it were longer than just six episodes but those six episodes are full of action, blood, sex, betrayal, everything that Blood and Sand was & more! Gannicus was a great character to have and was not as annoying as Spartacus was in Blood and Sand. This prequel to the first season presents an abundant amount of missing and unknown information from the first season which provides better understanding to what is going on, who is who, why they were or were not there in the first season and much more..The nudity, sex and goofy language is there just as it were in Blood and Sand, but I must admit I was not as put off by it as I was with the first season. By now the obscene, yet rather odd, language is quite enjoyable and laughable where as in the first season I was not to favorable of it. Naked people are all over the screen yet again, most are quite pleasing to look at though. I read that the blu ray release will contain extended episodes too much for tv as the first season did which is always a nice plus to have. I will be purchasing this on blu ray once it is released and will be purchasing Blood and Sand so that I can go back and watch it again. I'm sure I'd enjoy it much much more the second time around. I hope I've been helpful..<br /><br />-Cam
0312600844|5.0|The wide variance in reviewer star ratings shows the passion that \\"Freedom\\" has stirred up. (Perhaps you should try the first chapter on your Kindle before you commit to it.)You will either love this book or hate it.  In my case, I LOVED it.    Freedom is what the \\"Great American Novel\\" is all about.  Franzen has been compared to Tolstoy, which is an apt comparison.  I consider him instead a Tom Wolfe without the hyperkinetic descriptions.  In fact, this novel reminded me a bit of \\"A Man in Full.\\"  He deftly captures the zeitgeist of the United States in the first decade of the 2000s.    The characters of Freedom were as real as any I have ever read.  Franzen is so masterful at the character detail that it feels autobiographical, just as a great actor convinces you he has really experienced what he portrays.  Like many works of art, his message is not \\"on the nose\\" so each reader will get out of it that which they find in it.    Some have criticized the pacing of Freedom.  I found it perfectly paced, every page a joy.  I compare it to people that rush through a museum without reading the details of the exhibits.  I savored every page of this book.  If your tastes run more toward modern thrillers, you will find it too slow.  I found Freedom poetic, nearly Nabakov-like, never once boring.    Freedom: the Great American Novel.

0307593495|4.0|Closing Henning Mankell's The Troubled Man after reading the final page it gave me even deeper feeling of sadness to that experienced when I closed The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. The knowledge that the hours I'd spent with this masterful writer and his creation, Kurt Wallander, were at an end. This was a sad novel, it deals a lot with the aging process, self reflection, decisions made, people loved and lost. This particular addition to the series has a more introspective cast throughout I felt. The Troubled Man of the title is his daughter Linda's prospective father in law, but it could also be Wallander himself. Wallander spends a good deal of time on his past, revisiting old cases as well as events in his life, his relationships with his family members, most particularly his father and Linda. He has two bittersweet reunions. To say any more would give too much away. While I have enjoyed reading Mankell's standalone novels, his Wallander novels are most resonant. As with all the previous Wallander novels, this richly plotted final outing has a global reach, and while based in his native Sweden, there is traveling and international intrigue.They are going to be missed.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I agree 100% with the good things written by hundreds of reviewers about 7506's (and with none of the few negatives). On the advice of some, I did purchase on Amazon the Beyerdynamic EDT 200 Velour Padded Earcushions for Sony 7506 and others. Have now had both products for about three months and couldn't be happier. See separate review dated 4/11/11 re excellent Beyerdynamic velour earcushions...they are sold by pair on Amazon for about $20 and worth every penny for 100% use, for replacement of worn out OEM's, for swapping in and out with pleathers, whatever.

0060005696|1.0|Anyone who's ever purchased a mobile phone plan knows large arrays of choices are aggravating and can create undue & unneccesary stress.  It turns out that large arrays of examples supporting your thesis are also aggravating when they're nothing more than the exact same information wearing a different skin.  Mr Schwartz had me from Chapter 1 in this (negative) respect.      I found Paradox of Choice to be eminently skimmable, and - on the bright side - leaves the reader with little or no guilt (therefore no stress) when setting the book down with no intentions of picking it back up again.    To be fair, Mr Schwartz' solutions to a less stressful life are straightforward enough.  They basically amount to \\"moderation\\", which is something common sense tells us (whether we choose to listen is another matter), and does not require this book.      That's one less choice you have to make - you're welcome.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Wasting Light is the band's first album after the Wembley Stadium gig, and you can tell that Grohl's made a conscientious decision to create a record that can, from start to finish, enthrall thousands of Foo fans in a big arena. The inclusion of Pat Smear (which disturbed Chris somewhat) was a vital step towards that goal and the Foo Fighters now have what it takes to one-up what's, arguably, their proudest moment - playing alongside the Led Zeppelin folks at Wembley. Wasting Light is the best Foo album to rock out to, but it's devoid of their softer side of the likes of In Your Honor's second disc. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, songs such as \\"These Days\\" and \\"Walk\\" would definitely sound great in an acoustic setting.     As far as the individual tracks are concerned:    1)\\"Bridge Burning\\" is the perfect opener, much like \\"The Pretender.\\"     2) \\"Rope\\" is not the strongest track on this album and probably should not have been the opening single. The latter half of the song is more energetic and captivating than the blander start.     3) Bob Mould's appearance on \\"Dear Rosemary\\" lifts the song into a terrific, heavy, angst-driven power ballad.    4)\\"White Limo\\" is one my favorite tracks of the album (Grohl's vocal chords are tougher than steel) and the video on YouTube is just hilarious.     5) \\"Arlandria\\" is an epitome of a crowd-pleaser - I dare you not to scream \\"you are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria\\" Give up, it's too damn catchy.     6) \\"These Days\\" reminds me of \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Learn to Fly\\" but fails to reach the soul-nourishing heights of those two classics.     7) \\"Back and Forth\\" is a throwback to the 90s pop-punk combination Grohl mastered back then.    8) \\"A Matter of Time\\" is sweet one that I wish would be remixed into something much softer.     9) \\"Miss the Misery\\" is \\"Arlandria 2.0\\" and the one filler in this album.     10) \\"I Should Have Known\\" is a haunting tribute to loved ones passed away. Krist Novoselic's contribution adds a layer ofsolemnity to a grief-stricken, personal song that's not so personal after all.    11) \\"Walk\\" is one of the most uplifting, poetic masterpieces the gang's ever produced. If you don't want to buy the whole album, at least get this track - you won't regret it.     Final Recommendation: While not perfect, Wasting Light is a welcome addition to the Foo Fighter's repertoire. I predict \\"Bridge Burning,\\" \\"Dear Rosemary,\\" \\"Arlandria,\\" \\"I Should Have Known,\\" and \\"Walk\\" contesting for a spot in the next Foo Fighter's Greatest Hits compilation album. Grade: A-, 4.5 stars.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Let's face it.........this is a study in acting.  If you want to see great acting talent watch this movie.  The fact that this film has no elaborate settings actually focuses your attention on character development.  How many movies do that these days?  Bravo!!
B002MU4NL8|5.0|While, as the Amazon description says, it's helpful to be a STAR TREK fan or at least know about the series while watching this film, since inside jokes like \\"I see you got your shirt off\\" may make little sense if you don't, one really doesn't even have to be a science-fiction fan to get a kick out of this movie. It is representative of fandom for any popular cultural icon, going back to when 19th century \\"fan fiction\\" sequels were written to Jane Austen novels, girls re-enacted memorable romantic poetry scenes (think the \\"Lady of Shalott\\" sequence in ANNE OF GREEN GABLES), and radio listeners sent baby booties and wedding gifts whenever a birth or marriage happened on their favorite soap opera.<br /><br />The characters, of course, are strong TREK/SF archetypes: the stalwart commander (who in real life is a ham actor who realizes how much of his present life is a shambles), the genius alien, the miraculous engineer who can fix anything, the obligatory sex symbol, the precocious kid, and the nervous extra who realizes that if life imitates art his life is forfeit.<br /><br />Tim Allen lends a poignant note to Jason Nesmith when he realizes his has-been status, and does a creditable turn as an (albeit bumbling) action hero. Alan Rickman is perfect as the exasperated Brit whose alien character is beloved, but who always will be second fiddle to Nesmith's charisma, and Sigourney Weaver fun as the \\"eye candy\\" crewman who wishes she had had more intelligent things to do on the ship but flash her boobs and talk to the computer. Robin Sachs, the creepy \\"Ethan\\" on the BUFFY series, turns in a bravura performance as the menacing Sarris. Daryl Mitchell as the grown-up child actor and Sam Rockwell as the gonzo extra Guy Fleegman also turn in great performances, Enrico Colatoni is delightful as Mathazar, leader of the alien Thermians pleading for help from Nesmith and his crew, Justin Long had the right combination of smarts and geekiness as the fannish Brandon, but my favorite character in this hilarious sendup is Fred Kwan, played by Tony Shaloub. He never loses his cool (well, except once), and faces ray guns, space ships, and aliens (even one with tentacles and a big smile) with phlegmatic aplomb.<br /><br />This film was the reason we went out and bought our original DVD player, and now the Blu-Ray version of GALAXY QUEST is better than ever, stunning, crisp picture and even better sound than was on the original DVD release. This film is a must for every SF fan, or even for anyone who's found himself as part of any fandom.is hilarious sendup is Fred Kwan, played by Tony Shaloub.

B000MV9026|5.0|Happy Feet is a fun, musically inclined movie about a penguin who is different and is often misunderstood. After a series of trials and tribulations, the main character discovers the special talents that separate him from the rest. The message of uniqueness and the value of being different from everyone else is the highlight of the movie.     This movie may be particularly helpful as a resource for parents of children who feel misunderstood, different, or alienated by peers. I have used the film and the main points it makes to broach the aforementioned topics with children during counseling sessions. Other discussions that can stem from this movie are the importance of having a mind of your own and doing what you like, being inclusive, and learning to value everyone's differences. Parents can begin similar conversations with their children using the movie as they see fit.

0307341577|4.0|As with Gillian Flynn's debut novel, Sharp Objects, in Dark Places, the author also deals with the psychology of someone who is mentally unwell (among many other issues including a farmer's tough life and the way things were in the 80's for them). In this case, the protagonist, Libby, is mentally unwell because of the trauma she suffered as a child. Her family was murdered by not just anyone, her brother. She was the only one that managed to escape. Since then, she has become very bitter,  uncaring, lonely, clinically depressed, has developed kleptomania, and seems to have a difficult time forming healthy relationships. She believes all of these will keep her from functioning enough to get a job. In my opinion she should have seeked therapy as it might have helped her function. Because she does not think she can get a job where she won't get fired and is running out of the money she's been living on (money sent to her by well-wishers who know about the murders of her family), she winds up selling family memorabilia to the Kill Club. The Kill Club is a horrible group of people obsessed with murders. They challenge Libby's idea that her brother was the murder that fateful night of January 3, 1985. Throughout the book the readers are told (in flashbacks) about the events of that night and events leading up to it. All is told through the point of view of Libby, Ben, and Patty, their mother. Readers, like Libby, will begin to question whether Libby at the young age of 7 was correct in stating her brother was the murderer. I know it seems as if just by knowing that readers will think \\"okay so then Ben probably wasn't the killer.\\" Trust me, there's a lot you won't see coming and it's all worth the ride. The fact that it's so fast paced and makes you turn the pages like a madman/madwomen, adds to the enjoyment level.<br /><br />I must state that this book had its merits, but it also had its downsides. I found myself unable to like the Kill Club, including Lyle. No matter what any of them say, they're just using Libby for their own entertainment and that is effed up. I will never find myself being okay with that. Libby played along because she wanted the money, which I think was horrible, yet I can see where her thought process was on that issue. Either way, she should have seeked therapy to help her. She did not need to resort to selling her family's items.<br /><br />Concerning Libby's entire family; they are so flawed. All of them. I liked that. Don't get me wrong, it was unfortunate for them. For their flaws, I can understand why readers might find the family (even the younger sisters) unlikeable, but hey! People are like this in real life! I liked the honesty in this book. No matter how \\"messed\\" up everyone in this book was, you will find people like this in real life. Hopefully someone can come into their life and help them.<br /><br />When I think about it, Libby and her family were not the only ones with mental issues. Pretty much every single character in this book had a problem.<br /><br />In reference to memories, I had never thought about this issue before until I volunteered with an organization that helps children who have been abused. another organization had spoken to us about how back in the day, children who have gone through a trauma, were interviewed incorrectly. this led to false testimonies and many other consequences. one of the worst things that occurred was that the child would be forced to relive the trauma over and over because they would have to retell their story to numerous people like the local policemen, FBI, mother, father, aunt, etc. obviously this was not a good way to go about things. not only does it negatively affect the child, but what the child is saying may gradually change. it's not that the child is lying, but memories change the more you conjure them. It does not help when cops (they shouldn't do this anymore) used to ask children questions phrased in a way that would cause the child to believe something else occurred. for example, a cop may have asked a child \\"that man touched you didn't he? he hurt you? where did he hurt you?\\" the child might then start to believe that an event that did not occur, did in fact occur. the child will start to think that they were hurt by someone. If someone keeps repeating the same question to the child, \\"did you get touched by that man?\\" the child may end up giving the \\"right\\" answer, or the answer they believe the adults want to hear. they may then end up thinking the event really occurred. memories are a fragile thing. fascinating though. you're supposed to ask a child something like \\"what happened that day?\\" not \\"did he touch you?\\" I learned a lot of this from my psychology classes and research by Deborah Poole (among others). Look at something interesting a professor of psychology, Stephen Ceci, stated:<br />Our review of typical interviews from the 1980s shows many investigators blindly pursued a single hypothesis: Sexual abuse occurred. They would reinforce that hypothesis to the children, who would be led to believe in it.<br />It is essential to keep in mind now that most children with such implanted memories will have believed in their allegations of abuse for far longer than they were alive before those allegations first surfaced. Those 'implanted' memories are no less visceral than real-life memories.<br />Remember, this book took place in the 80's.<br /><br />Quote:<br />Libby's father, Runner, talking to her:<br />\\"How long it's been since I seen you, little girl? You get that flamingo ashtray I sent you?\\" The flamingo ashtray I got more than two decades ago, when I was a nonsmoking ten-year-old.<br /><br />Possible spoilers:<br />I feel that if Ben hadn't continued to be in an effed up relationship with Diondra, maybe he would have been better off. He may not have been as angry. All she did was tear him down. She and her step-brother Trey continually lowered his self-esteem. There is a reason that shouldn't happen to people. it can make them ANGRY! Anger leads to violence. Bad, bad things.<br />As for Michelle, I can completely see that girl growing up to be just like Ben. Demented, almost. By the end of the book, I wondered if there was a mental illness running in the family. Maybe not Patty, or their father (although alcoholism is technically a mental illness I don't mean that kind), but someone before them.

This is a powerful book, one that will stick with me for a long time.<br /><br />A girl commits suicide, leaving behind her own little legacy: a box of cassette tapes. These tapes send the listener on a journey into her past and the thirteen reasons why she took her own life. The reader 'listens' to the tapes through the point of view of Clay, who had a long-term crush on the narrator but never had the guts to ask her out. He is reason number 9.<br /><br />I absolutely devoured this book with a horrified fascination. The same way Clay listened to the tapes, anxious to continue the tapes yet disgusted by his peers' roles in them. I think it would have been nice to get deeper inside Hannah's head, but I'm afraid it would have become a 'woe-is-me' story rather than having the head-on crash impact that it had.<br /><br />I do not feel this book is for anyone contemplating suicide. In a way, I think it romanticizes it with those cassette tapes. When a person considers killing themselves, their thoughts veer to \\"They won't miss me until I'm gone. They won't realize I'm really here until I'm gone. They won't miss me at all. They won't understand what they did to me until I'm gone. When I'm gone, then they will feel bad for what they did to me.\\" And on and on. I think that by Hannah leaving her little legacy, explaining her story personally to each person who played a roll in her death, I feel it glorifies suicide. It may make it seem more appealing to those already considering it.<br /><br />Rather, I feel this book is a great learning experience for teens and parents together. I don't think people realize that even the tiniest action, good or bad, creates its own snowball effect. Some die off quickly, others grow and grow until they are completely out of control. I think this book is a perfect example of that, I think it's a great tool to teach teens that fact. You never know if a cruel word can set someone down a suicidal path or whether a kind gesture will lead them off. It's a very thought-provoking story. No one ever truly knows the results of their actions, you can only control what you decide to do in a moment, your own intentions. Also, maybe this story will help someone recognize that a friend might be in trouble and reach out.

Nemo recruits a few friends to help him along the quest to return home to his father.     Finding Nemo presents a perfect opportunity to begin a serious discussion with children regarding safety, talking to strangers, and carrying contact information with them in case of an emergency.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|Some years ago, I was invited to be on the membership committee of PEN, the distinguished international literary organization. That was not someone's best idea --- because there's almost no reason to reject any working writer, meetings tended to be boring --- so I thought of a way to liven them up.<br /><br />The problem with PEN, I said, is that it has a very narrow, 19th century sense of what constitutes a \\"writer.\\" But, I continued, that definition exploded in 1962 or 1963, when Bob Dylan started hitting his stride. Now we've had four or five decades of songs that wouldn't be out of place in poetry magazines --- we ought to let a few of these kids into PEN. Dylan first, of course, then the usual suspects: Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Carole King, Rodney Crowell, Rosanne Cash, John Prine. And Paul Simon.<br /><br />Talk about a non-start. I'm not sure the higher-ups at PEN ever really heard the idea of welcoming singer-songwriters. Or maybe they did --- not much later, the membership committee was disbanded.<br /><br />And now it's a decade later, and I'm listening to \\"So Beautiful or So What,\\" Paul Simon's 12th solo release and his first in 5 years. Music is not a competitive sport --- unless you happen to be a musician --- but I'd put this up there with recent Dylan and a few lengths ahead of the recent Springsteen releases.<br /><br />This will not be a majority view. If you love Dylan --- and I do, just not blindly --- he will always stand alone, like Shakespeare. And no one works harder in live performance than Springsteen; he's a monument to the dignity and decency of blue-collar America. Simon? In the poet laureate of rock race, he'll always be third, simply because he never seems to break a sweat. He's the king of sprezzatura, defined as \\"a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it.\\"<br /><br />Gee, it must be a tough to be that talented.<br /><br />Listening to this CD, I think just the opposite: It don't come easy, this thing Simon does here. I know him slightly, and while I would not describe him as unhappy or neurotic, neither would I describe him as a jolly fellow. He's interior, quiet, with a sharp eye and a sharper tongue. The years when he was the crown prince of irony are long gone; for a while, he's been one of music's most serious thinkers. And now he's thought --- and felt --- his way to happy. That is, if these songs are to be believed, to peace in his personal life and a cheerful acceptance of the universe. When you're 69, that's pretty great.<br /><br />Some critics and friends are calling this Simon's best CD since \\"Graceland.\\" I can understand why. The music is international. The playing is loose, relaxed --- indeed, it sometimes sounds as if you're listening to a rehearsal.<br /><br />But it's not \\"Graceland,\\" not in any way I care about. Not musically, first of all --- you can appreciate this music, can even love it, but you're not going to walk down the street humming these songs. And it's not just that the melodies won't support that pleasure. It's that, this time, you really have to pay attention to the words. Because if you start connecting the dots, you get a picture of Simon's long and successful marriage to singer-songwriter Edie Brickell, and, even more, to what might be a roadmap to happiness of your own.  Like this:<br /><br />Sweet July, and we drove the Montauk Highway<br />And walked along the cliffs above the sea<br />And we wondered why, and imagined it was someday<br />And that is how the future came to be<br />Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen<br />To make a marriage bed<br />And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through<br />And dream our dreams of dazzling blue<br /><br />My Lord, that is lovely. And lovelier, still, for the knowledge that it has a sell-by date. From another song:<br /><br />Something called me from my sleep<br />Love and blessings<br/>Simple kindness<br />Ours to hold but not to keep<br /><br />Paul Simon, a romantic? How else do you explain this:<br /><br />Who believes in angels?<br />I do<br />Fools and pilgrims all over the world.<br /><br />I take \\"So Beautiful\\" as testimony: A man fights his way through all the exterior garbage and the even messier inner garbage, and emerges with a statement that makes it seem easy. Indeed, a throwaway: so beautiful or so what.<br /><br />I'm just a raindrop in a bucket<br />A coin dropped in a slot<br />I am an empty house on Weed Street<br />Across the road from the vacant lot<br />You know life is what you make of it<br />So beautiful or so what...<br /><br />Ours to choose.

I think this soundtrack will be loved from the fans of<br />the actresses/singers and also fans of the movie. If you haven't seen the<br />movie I recommend you watch it first, then maybe buy the CD.<br /><br />4.5/5: Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Notes: I like mostly ALL of the song except for one that I usually skip and<br />I know most of the songs by heart, which is mildly strange, but whatever.<br /><br />Off Topic: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie and music, I wasn't<br />expecting to like it so much. I love horror movies and comedies, but this one<br />was one I really liked and the music was very catchy.<br /><br />A.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Being from Hawaii, I have a soft spot for any musician making the big time.  But Bruno brings a refreshingly different energy and drive to his music, and an irresistible, foot tapping rhythm that keeps you listening for more.  The only flaw that mars this great CD is the sound quality.  The recording is overly bass heavy, veiled, and sounds like there's a towel over your speakers.  It almost sounds like an old mono recording poorly remastered into stereo.  I can't stand listening to it on my home system, but it's great in my car.  I hope Bruno finds a better sound engineer on his next effort.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|This is a good case but, could be made a little stiffer at the flap to keep the case from closing in on itself.  Otherwise it is a great case and protects the earpiece from damage.

B004NSULHM|4.0|I got this album today and enjoyed a lot...a rainy, stormy afternoon what else you should do if you're all alone...hear Radiohead! If you're under controlled medication or high sure you will have a good time with this album. I wasn't skeptical about the negative reviews and when see the cheap price I have no doubt and make a pre-order, it's  the cheapest pseudo-digipack version ever seen but the artwork is cool but no lyrics, I like all the song except for Feral that I guess that was a joke...anyway I'm happy Radiohead still make some music
0061245097|5.0|Cat's back. But now it's Special Agent Cat Crawford...    It's been four years since Cat left the love of her life, Bones, sneaking away in the hopes of protecting both his life, and her mother's. Screw her own happiness. It could never work out with Bones anyway, and she'll never be happy without him. So as long as they can't be together, she'll keep him safe. She's now working for a secret department of Homeland Security, dealing with the undead like only she can.    A job Cat's working takes an unexpected twist, and when Bones shows up at her best friend's wedding, well... will she be able to control her attraction to him? Pfft, you know the answer: hell to the no.    Cat has grown a lot in the last four years. She's now a foul-mouthed, gin-swilling, \\"raging bitch\\". By her own admission. And boy, is she bitter. She's living for her job: killing the undead. Without Bones, she doesn't really have much joy in her life. Cat drove me nuts in the first Night Huntress book, Halfway to the Grave. She was immature and prejudiced, and while I understood this (and it was an important part of the story), I really appreciate that she's grown into the character she was clearly intended to be. Seeing Cat adjust her outlook on the future of a relationship between her and Bones is very sweet, and watching her finally stand up to her vindictive bitch of a mother is worth gold.    The pace in this book is rocketing--it's non-stop action. Whether it's Cat and Bones flirting, or Cat and Bones kicking ass, Frost keeps it moving along like a freight train. This installment has more action, more excitement, and more *ahem* EVERYTHING than the last.    We also far more vivid worldbuilding than the previous installment. Where as [[ASIN:B000W94FU0 Halfway to the Grave]] seemed to be lacking some depth (to me), OFITG has a far richer backdrop. Secondary characters are now more than a backup cast, they're rich and multi-faceted. Cat has friends, colleagues, and the added dimension these addto the story and world are invaluable. As much as I don't necessarily like him, Cat's relationship with Tate is interesting, and important, I think, in grounding her.    As with Halfway to the Grave, the book's really a vehicle for the sizzling interaction and relationship between our two heroes. It has some of the hottest scenes in it I've ever read (or seen on TV), and actually had me blushing (chapter 32--you'll know what I mean). What I love about these books though, is that there's a plot, and it's this that drives the books. Yes, it's to develop Cat and Bones' relationship, but this is never at the expense of great storytelling.    All the issues I had with Halfway to the Grave are gone in One Foot in the Grave. Cat's grown up, Bones doesn't push her around as much, and we have our couple on much more equal footing. There are so many laugh at loud parts of this book (Bones vs. Tate, and Bones vs. Justina). The Night Huntress series have filled a Buffy-shaped hole in my heart, and this installment is infinitely better than the last. If you enjoyed Halfway to the Grave, you'll LOVE One Foot in the Grave. Read it. Now.
0060090383|4.0|Marian Keyes is a very funny writer, and like so many of her books, this one manages to deal with a serious subject and still be tremendously entertaining. The serious subject here is drug and alcohol addiction. In New York Irish ex-pat Rachel Walsh's life devolves as she develops cocaine and alcohol addictions. After losing her job, her boyfriend, and her best friend, Rachel finds herself back in Ireland in treatment. Refusing to believe that she is an addict, Rachel agrees to treatment only because she thinks she might see celebrities. What follows are Rachel's comic misadventures as an addict in denial while in treatment, interspersed with the story of how she became an addict.<br /><br />Keyes has an amazing ability to bring humor to horrible situations, and this is a book to read when you need a pick-me-up. The ending is a bit unbelievable, but the book is by and large light and fun reading.

B004UOE7VA|5.0|I like the remixed album much better than the original soundtrack. The original soundtrack had a lot of ambient music that wasn't worth listening to on it's own, but it did have a few decent tracks. The remixed album took all the high points from the soundtrack and made it an awesome electronica album. I'm not saying to whole album is completely awesome, but that's how all albums are to me. I actually wish they would have just used this album as the soundtrack to the movie. It's definitely worth a listen if you like electronic music.

This book is small and a quick read but I read it twice to make sure I extracted all that I could.  As you start to implement the steps your book becomes a friendly reference guide. Gary makes it sound easy enough but I was left wanting a bit more.
B004J88SGC|5.0|This is just the best concert DVD I have ever seen.  I compared Billy Joel's voice now to cd's I had for some time and I believe his voice has gotten better.  The entire stage presentation was super.  The rest of the band was great!  I've played this concert at least 10 times in as many days. Just perfect in all ways.  Order the DVD with the two CD's as you'll want to listen in your car as well.  Mesmerizing.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Agora is an intelligently beautiful movie of historical fiction demonstrating the clash of three distinct cultures battling for control and influence in the 4th century city of Alexandria in Roman-controlled Egypt.  The Jews, long removed from their slave history, are generally portrayed as rich and influential merchants of the period, though they play a minor role in the movie.  The Pagans, a polytheistic culture grounded in philosophy, mathematics and observational science to seek divine comprehension play a dominant role.  The Christians of the time are acknowledged as the hopeless seeking hope and they are shown as the emerging influence.  As the three cultures of wealth, knowledge and hope converge, the winner will be rewarded with both political and legal control of the people's hearts, minds, and pocketbooks.  It should be no surprise or movie spoiler to anyone who has studied history to watch the Christians win the battle in the movie.    Agora impressively demostrates the science and mathematics of the 4th century, encapsulating the Pagan knowledge in Hypatia, a real-life philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer of the time.  Anyone who has studied the history of astronomy will appreciate the detail to which ancient beliefs were demonstrated by Hypatia in the movie.        Finally, anyone who has studied Christian church history will recognize some cultural details of the origins of the modern Christian church, especially Catholicism.  The fundamentalist spirit of the movie, especially the violence demonstrated by the emerging influence, most likely resulted in a US release on only 17 theater screens.      Only the DVD is available in the US but the transfer is exceptional.
B0042RUMJG|2.0|I love Sting The Musician but not Sting The Singer. In this bluray product, he used the full orchestra to back his solo singing performance and I think it overloaded the audience's welcome of Sting.    It could be better if Sting infused into his program other singers to keep the show fresh and alive. Because,let face it,his voice lacks the necessary dynamic of a great singer, and after three songs, we were craving for a new face, a new voice, just anything for variety, but he kept on singing songs after songs. I could not take it any more and had to turned the bluray off before the end...A big waste with the full wonderful orchestra.    I wish Sting should focus more on his music playing, arranging, composing instead of his singing.

0618680004|1.0|Firstly, there is no evidence to support the theory of evolution by natural selection. Of course, evolution occurs, but the correct explanation is Lamarck's theory of evolution through acquired characteristics. Secondly, as an argument for the non-existence of God, the book is a total failure.<br /><br />As I went through this book, I made notes of where Dawkins was unscientific.<br /><br />Page 19: He makes the point that \\"true scientists\\" have a \\"passionate commitment to evidence. My passion is based on evidence.\\" - If that is the case then he is not a true scientist otherwise he would have observed that there is no evidence to support Darwinism.<br /><br />Page 22: He states that people \\"cling to\\" religion because they have been \\"let down by our educational system\\" - Does he cling to his Darwinism because he himself has been let down by the private boarding school educational system?<br /><br />Page 23: He states that with no religion there would have been no 9/11 and no 7/7, but he doesn't state what evidence there is linking religion to these two events.<br /><br />Page 26: He asserts that atheism is \\"something to be proud of\\" and that the \\"status of atheists in America today is on a par with that of homosexuals fifty years ago\\". This is highly doubtful. Upton Sinclair released a book called The Profits of Religion almost a hundred years ago, and he very nearly was elected governor of California.<br /><br />On page 46 he refers to the twelve danish cartoons \\"depicting the prophet Mohammed\\". If he was a scientist and examined the evidence he would have seen that Mohammed only appears in a couple of these cartoons and not in all twelve.<br /><br />Pages 55, 59 and 60: In a discussion about deists, including Tom Paine and Thomas Jefferson, he declares, \\"Certainly their writings on religion in their own time leave me in no doubt that most of them would have been atheists in ours\\". Certainly, eh? How does he know this? Has he consulted their spirits via a medium or ouija board? He doesn't say. He states that Paine died abandoned, except by Jefferson. He also states that Jefferson, \\"as so often got it right\\" about the use of ridicule against unintelligible propositions. What would Jefferson have to say about Darwinism, I wonder?<br /><br />Page 71: Thomas Huxley \\"never departed from scrupulously good manners\\". Yes he did. He dismissed spiritualism without bothering to investigate it. Also he was known as \\"Darwin's bulldog\\".<br /><br />Page 74: \\"Atheists do not have faith\\". They do, because there is no evidence to support atheism. Dawkins declares that he is agnostic at this point. He adds that he is agnostic about \\"fairies at the bottom of the garden\\". He calls himself a scientist. How is whether fairies exist or not relevant to the subject of atheism?<br /><br />Page 73: he invents the term \\"strong atheist\\". If someone is an atheist then they are an atheist. \\"Strong atheist\\" is a non sequitur.<br /><br />Page 76: \\"the burden of proof rests with the believers, not the non-believers\\". Why's that? The burden of proving his belief in atheism rests with atheists, not non-atheists.<br /><br />Page 77: \\"That you cannot prove God's non-existence is accepted and trivial\\". If that is the case, then why did he bother writing the book?<br /><br />Page 86: \\"[Prayer] experiments, if done properly, have to be double blind\\". Why? If prayer has no benefit, why shouldn't the person know they are being prayed for and who is praying for them?<br /><br />On page 89 he ridicules the comments of Oxford theologian Richard Swinburne that \\"There is quite a lot of evidence anyway of God's existence, and too much might not be good for us.\\" Might it not be boring for God if people did not bother trying to evolve their own minds.<br /><br />He begins a paragraph on page 122 with the words \\"Although Jesus probably existed\\". As far as I am aware, there is not a scrap of evidence to support the notion that Jesus Christ ever existed in the flesh. As a so-called scientist he should support his statements with evidence.<br /><br />The title of Chapter 4 is \\"Why There Almost Certainly Is No God\\". Dawkins confirms his agnosticism. An atheist would not have included the word \\"Almost\\".<br /><br />Page 139: \\"After Darwin we all should feel, deep in our bones, suspicious of th e very idea of design\\". Darwin believed in God. Towards the end of his Origin of the Species he refers to \\"the laws impressed on matter by the Creator\\". Alfred Russel Wallace was a spiritualist who believed in God. Also, Robert Chambers, the author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, an inspiration for Darwin, was a spiritualist.<br /><br />Page 142: \\"Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection - the ultimate scientific consciousness-raiser\\". Without this theory Marxism would never have become popular and Freud would not have formulated his degrading theories. The Theory of Natural Selection sets a premium on sex and greed. \\"Survival of the fittest\\" implies that anyone who thinks he's a specimen of the fittest can use his short life to the best of his advantage and trample over anyone who stands in his way.<br /><br />Page 144: \\"It's impossible to exaggerate the magnitude of the problem that Darwin and Wallace solved.\\" They didn't solve it. Lamarck solved it.<br /><br />Page 146: intelligent design is \\"faulty logic\\". Darwin and Wallace believed in a designer, so it seems Dawkins is displaying faulty logic.<br /><br />Page 155: he refers to \\"fools\\" who see a conjuror bend a spoon and say that it is \\"paranormal\\". Is he referring to Uri Geller? Has he researched the paranormal himself? He doesn't say.<br /><br />Page 195: \\"Homeopaths may be achieving relative success because they, unlike orthodox practitioners, are still allowed to administer placebos - under another name\\". How does he know this? Has he researched the orthodox practice of psychiatry and compared anti-depressant medication with placebos?<br /><br />Page 205: \\"Natural selection builds child brains to believe whatever their parents and trained elders tell them. Such trusting obedience is valuable for survival. For excellent reasons related to Darwinian survival, child brains need to trust parents, and elders whom parents tell them to trust.\\" Darwinism as social control. In [[ASIN:B0007DEPN8 Brain-washing in Red China]] Edward Hunter pointed out the emphasis on Darwinism in the Chinese Communist educational system, for instance lectures on \\"The Evolution of Society\\", which combined Darwinism with the theory of a class society. Natural selection conditions people to think they are intelligent animals without a soul and with no conscience. This allows them to base their lives on the principles of Karl Marx.<br /><br />Page 246: Dawkins states that the former CEO of Enron Jeff Skilling's favorite book was The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Skilling reportedly referred to himself as a \\"Social Darwinist\\". This seems to demonstrate that the theory of natural selection encourages people to be greedy. In addition, John D. Rockefeller justified his business practices with these words: \\"The growth of a large business is merely the survival of the fittest ... The American beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which bring cheer to its beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow up around it.\\" The theory of natural selection seems to be admired by both Communists and monopoly capitalists.<br /><br />Page 302: \\"T.H. Huxley by the standards of his time was an enlightened and liberal progressive\\". Dawkins doesn't back this statement up with any evidence, unsurprisingly. In [[ASIN:1147210713 My Life: A Record of Events and Opinions, Volume 2]], Alfred Russel Wallace states that he sent Huxley a pamphlet entitled The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural and that Huxley's response was, \\"I am neither shocked nor disposed to issue a Commission of Lunacy against you.\\" Wallace states that Huxley was unable to accept paranormal phenomenaas facts, so he denounced them as impostures. Can someone displaying a blinkered attitude as Huxley be described as an \\"enlightened and liberal progressive\\"?<br /><br />Page 304: \\"Donald Rumsfeld, who sounds so callous and odious today, would have sounded like a bleeding-heart liberal if he had said the same things during the Second World War.\\" Dawkins is in no position to refer to anyone sounding callous and odious as he is someone who preaches the doctrine of the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.<br /><br />Page 305: \\"Hitler seems especially evil only by the more benign standards of our time.\\" The implication from this seems to be that if Dawkins was writing further back in time then his reaction to Hitler would be softer than it is today. He doesn't state what aspects of Hitler's policies would seem less than especially evil in the past compared with the present. Darwin's son and uncle were involved in the Eugenics movement. Is he referring obliquely to this?<br /><br />Page 317: \\"I do not by nature thrive on confrontation. I don't think the adversarial format is well designed to get at the truth.\\" He seems to have an adversarial attitude to homeopathy and the paranormal. Perhaps that is why he shows no interest to get at the truth of these.<br /><br />On page 343 he discusses the 7/7 London bombings: \\"Only religious faith is a strong enough force to motivate such utter madness in otherwise sane and decent people.\\" The implication is that Islam is to blame. However, there remain unanswered questions about this incident, e.g. where did the bombers get such high quality explosives from? It is presumptuous to blame religion in this case.<br /><br />On page 421 I learned that there is a \\"Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science\\". This would appear to be an oxymoron.<br /><br />The bibliography mentions the book \\"Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think\\".

B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|I agree with other reviewers' belief that this is REM's best album in many years, but that isn't saying much. REM has been an \\"oldies\\" group for at least a decade. That's not a bad thing when you have oldies that are some of rock's most enduring songs and REM certainly had several of those. The band now apparently recognizes that its real strength is in those songs, because Collapse Into Now is chock full of lyrical and musical references to its early songs. Some of those references actually detract from the music, however, like prominent product placement in a movie. The music should stand on its own without being propped up by references to earlier hits. Sadly, the songs on this album don't pass that test. Most of them are good starts to what might have been great songs, but we'll never know for sure.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Wasting Light at first blush sounds like a return to the stripped down hard rocking of There is Nothing Left to Lose, The Foo Fighters and The Color and Shape, but Wasting Light illustrates how the band can go back to their roots and extend rather than repeat past success.  If you like the hard driving, rock music that was the band at its start then you will love the album. With lyrics that hark back to those early albums, the Foo Fighters have given what makes them great a whole new spin.<br /><br />You hear overtones to just about everything they have done in the past, including the singles and Them Crooked Vultures influencing the songs, but rather than sounding old, tired, retreads they are fresh and new.  If you have been playing the early albums a lot lately, just because you wanted some hard driving rock, then you will be very very happy with this album.<br /><br />The band is not shy about its music, rather than mixing a sound that appeals to midrange earbuds, Wasting Light is a full bore Rock Album. I listened to it first on my iPad with the built in speaker and said 'what is up\\" as it sounded tinny and not like a good Foo Album.  I got the same impression listening to them on SNL as they just did not sound like a rock band because the TV's sound system could not handle it.<br /><br />Then I hooked up to a decent pair of speakers with good low range capabilities and the album just blossomed.  It would be worthwhile to invest in better earbuds to make sure you hear the album they made, not what the earbuds give you.<br /><br />Critics will point to the similarities of past albums and may use that to ding the group, but they will miss the point.  Its one thing to constantly break new ground, you try and you fail.  Its another thing to break new ground and then come back to your roots and do it even better.  That is what I mean by going back to go much further.  That is what the Foo Fighters have done with this.  Yes its straight forward rock, but its rock informed and improved by all the intervening albums.  I cannot wait to see them in concert.<br /><br />Rather than describe each of the songs, which others have done better than I could, lets just say that I am glad to have this in my play list and I cannot wait to get in my car and give it and this album a spin.  Great timing with the spring and summer.<br /><br />Enjoy and be well.he intervening albums.  I cannot wait to see them in concert.

0307593495|3.0|Mankell has combined a number or stories in this novel, perhaps too many.  The mystery is why a man disappears, followed later by his wife who is found dead.  In the course of nearly four hundred pages we learn more about detective Wallender's life than we want to know.  One story is his relationship with his daughter who has just had a child with her investor boyfriend.  He is going to have to learn to stop working all the time and help with the homework. A bit tedious.  One wonders why it is included.  Another is Wallender's relatioinship with his former wife who has become an alcoholic.  This one is superficial and easily skipped through.  She is rendered unattractive and therefore dashes any regrets Wallender might have had.  His former lover shows up unexpectedly and announces that she is dying of cancer.  She leaves abruptly and is killed in an auto accident the next day. He attends the funeral, tying up this loose end.  He, on the other hand is gradually coming apart.  His blood sugar is periodically low, and he is slipping into dementia.  His life is wrapped up and at least this reader felt some sympathy for him.  Like an acquaintance that has been having a bit of bad luck.  Wallender fades into the dustbin of literary history.    The mystery is another matter.  Tension is sustained through much of the book.  The disappeared man was a Swedish submarine commander.  Periodically the Soviets sent their submarines to test Sweden's defenses or at least chart some of their sea lanes.  Did he or someone he suspects give them some of Sweden's secrets?  That is the question through nearly three hundred pages.  But that was happening in the 70's and 80's.  Who would care now?  Evidently someone does.  And when his wife turns up murdered with a sophisticated East German drug we want to know who did it and why.  Well, surprize, it was the CIA.  And they did it to protect him from being exposed as he told some of Sweden's secrets to that international menace, the US.  Iguess Mankell thinks the folks in Langly have given up on the witness protection program and decided to terminate with extreme prejudice any suspicious wives.  Perhaps its a budgetary matter.  Or will Mankell's next book be comedy?  He could start with the retired agent he depicts who is living in Berlin and is picked up by a black Mercedes now and then.  He is undoubtedly up to no good.  What that is we are left to guess.  Its a pity the book has such an implausible ending.  Some Europeans act or write like the older hansome brother who is jealous of the younger brother's eclipsing success.  Not to be taken seriously.

It's going to be solid, probably not groundbreaking, but something you can throw into your computer and listen straight through. Wasting Light continues this trend very well. Compared to previous albums I'd put this one more similar to The Colour and the Shape than Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace. It's a harder album, but not overly so. A great album and I highly recommend.
160059672X|4.0|If you're not addicted to beading with cabochons - you will be by the time you're done looking through this beautiful book!  Despite the fact that it asks the reader/beader to use their imagination, it also gives many great tips and technique info that makes your cabochon beading experience even better. I liked that Sherry gave reasons why and why not for using certain tools and techniques.  I noticed that other reviewers were disappointed that there weren't 'step by step' instructions for the projects, however, bead embroidery and cabochon work is not an exact, and I love that it is 'freeform', and allows for creative embroidery work.  Definitely not a beginners book, though, and just having to buy the countless CRYSTALS in some of these projects can break the bank!   Great inspiration book.  ENJOY!

0123694965|5.0|Full of useful advice and very fun to read, I can't recommend The Art of Game Design enough. The lens have many uses and everything is very practical, something that is very important to me regarding game design books and material.  I also recommend the cards set (which are also available for free on the android market, though having the physical deck is way better) as it's a powerful tool for brainstorming and analysis.
B004R36QUE|5.0|I can't remember a film that had done so much for me as did \\"The King's Speech\\". (We were supposed to see it in Chicago on our winter break, but since I hadn't heard anything about it, we opted elsewhere.)  Back home the accolades for \\"The King' Speech\\" were very enthusiastic and everyone who saw it raved about it.   One day my friend and I went to the \\"cheap seats\\", economically, where there were, maybe, 12 people in the theater. A sudden enthusiastic warmth came over me, and I wanted to cheer on the film. And I saw it again!  You see, as a child. I had stuttering problems which I alone had to work to undo this function.  There are many more people who have this curse, and stay away from commuity gatherings because of it. To watch the beloved George VI of England anguish with his problem, it helped me understand my situation.  The craftsmanship, and intensive work on \\"The King's Speech\\" along with the actors, created an absolute brilliant, creative film that will certainly live on longer than just this year. I am thinking that \\"Gone With the Wind\\" was the last film I saw of any remarkable consequence.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|With the help of co-producer Phil Ramone, Simon's pipes still sound strong at sixty-nine. The music is reminiscent of his folk and world music textures that graced his glorious 1972 debut album and there are a few echoes of his classic \\"Graceland\\". He profers unanticipated twists in the midst of many of these cuts. He doesn\\"t know for sure what's out there in the great beyond but, concrete in his mind, is his appreciation of what's good and bad on earth. The cornerstone of this record is based on that concept.<br /><br />The harmony-driven \\"Dazzling Blue\\" is a melting pot delight highlighted by percussive effects of the tabla with strains of bluegrass fiddle. Simon forms an alliance between old music tradition and the modern on the effervescent \\"Love Is Eternal Sacred Light\\" and he employs the lower register of voices as he riddles of our existence via the Big Bang. A lovely instrumental interlude segues into a gripping ballad, \\"Questions For The Angels\\", in which a homeless man spots a Jay-Z billboard in Brooklyn who's wearing clothes that he can only dream about. Simon's own guitar phrasing is effectively used as the mainstay of its rhythm. The title track is set up to an ultra-hooky electric guitar riff played by his steadfast guitarist Vincent Nguini. And on the sprightly and hilarious \\"The Afterlife\\", Simon discovers he has to fill out a form first and wait in line to enter heaven.<br /><br />Simon is still a first-tier solo artist and hopefully this will appeal to a wider radius than he's had in years. It's that great.

B001N26GFC|5.0|Mike Leigh has changed in recent years, his stories are now more natural and more subtle. Happy Go Lucky, apart from having a great performance from Sally Hawkins does not tell you what to think. Has you thinking long after the film is over. And it's such a fun film too!
076532413X|5.0|If you enjoyed the TV show [[ASIN:076532413X Flashforward]] - which was pretty good, I must say - you will love the book.  The basic storyline is the same (albeit without some of the made-for-TV drama added into the show) - the whole world blacks out simultaneously and each person witnesses their own future.  But instead of flashing forward six months, as on TV, everyone flashes 20+ years ahead.  As you would imagine, this results in much greater confusion and visions that are more difficult to decipher (imagine for a minute where you were 20 years ago - if you had seen then where you are now, would you have been able to make any sense of what you saw?  I find this to be a fascinating question and line of thought, by the way, and worth talking through/thinking about with friends/family - especially over a cocktail/two...).  As someone moderately obsessed (teehee - is that even possible, to be moderately obsessed?) with time travel, I find this storyline extraordinarily intriguing.  The quest to figure out what happened - and perhaps more importantly why it did - is engaging and thought-provoking; Sawyer's explanations of the principles of physics that underpin the theories about the flash forward are as well.  As a first glimpse into the Sawyer world, FlashForward left me completely hooked.
B0000AK7AB|4.0|A great film for children to think about where their food comes from (\\"Where's the mummy pig going?\\"? \\"What's the man doing with that chicken?\\") but it will also encourage an enduring empathy with the animal world. Oh and it's fun!

0452289963|1.0|I read this book when it was first out. It's just plain awful. The only thing that I remember from having read this is an impression that this guy doesn't take responsibility for his actions. What is really sad is that the book uses the pretense of being spirtual for just being something else in society that reaffirms that we are an entitled society that pretends that it has no fault. To claim that the bad that let's say you do is not you doing it is just adding to the collective problem.
1591843790|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and came to regard the author as authoritative and likeable. He seemed generous being willing to credit ideas to others, and to use many different people's stories to illustrate his points.<br /><br />He makes big claims for his book, and the title \\"Enchantment\\" is a challenge. So for readers the question will be, \\"Does the enchantment last as you read this book?\\"<br /><br />I think it mostly does. I had not read Kawasaki before so I do not know to what extent this book overlaps with his previous work. In this book Kawasaki is providing a brief primer about certain key bits of behaviour that we need to show if we want to achieve personal and corporate success. The answer is that we achieve to the extent that we help others. There is little in here that is entirely new. What is useful here is that it pulls a lot of material about business life together into one place. The new bit for me was the section on social media and how to use it well.<br /><br />The book is brief, and I think this reflects that the author has thought clearly about what he wanted to say, and how he wanted to say it. The text is sufficient to explain the ideas. Overall this book does succeed in getting you to buy into its ideas. Which is what enchantment is all about- so it does justify its title<br /><br />This is a book that will be useful to many in business and other professions. I suspect it would be particularly useful to young people looking to move into companies by giving them some idea what their interviewers may be looking for.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I love this cd, love every song.  I keep it in the car, great to jam out to when I'm alone or with friends.  Lots of bad words so I never play it around the kids, but beyond that it's one of my favorites.
B001DJ7PMI|1.0|As movies go it doesn't get any better than JFK . This imo  is a masterpiece .It's well acted , well scripted and the movie itself is riveting. The characters are as interesting as they are complex , each woven in as part of the very intricate tapestry of the events of and leading up to  11/22/ 63.<br />There's just one minor problem . It's presented in documentary form and it's historically 99 % bulsh*t . Yes , there are shady characters that really existed like David Ferry , Clay Shaw , Guy Bannister and a host of others but Stone himself admits to taking quite a bit of poetic license with these characters .<br />After reading about the event and seeing a few scientific reenactments of the shooting itself , the only conclusion you can come to is that Oswald did the shooting . Yea ..Jack Ruby is a major problem for the Gerald Posners of the world who deny even the possibility of a mob link ..but if you are making a documentary/movie about the JFK assassination you might want to stick to the facts and leave your poetic license in your wallet .

1904920209|5.0|I came across this book on the Delia Smith's site. I had never heard of Richard Bertinet but as I was fed up of  making bread in the machine because my own always turned out as a brick I decided to give this one a try and at the same time I bought his second book [[ASIN:1856267202 Crust: Bread to Get Your Teeth into]] as well. This one is the one for real beginners, which happens to be my case. I knew the basics, had tried them a few times but, again, without a lot of success. The first bread I tried according to this method (which seems to be the French method of baking bread, just work the dough without adding any flour), although not one of Richard Bertinet's recipes was great, good crust, nice and soft.... a great bread! I am now making it again (just waiting for it to rise). My only problem is that my dough always seems to stay quite soft and sticky, no idea why. The DVD was a great help although it is better to watch is more than once to refresh what you have learned. The next best thing would be to attend one of Richard's workshops but well, I live too far away.     He seems to be very precise as to the amount of water he adds but according to what I have learnt it depends very much on the kind of flour you use, the humidity of the air.... so you should add bit by bit and see how much you need.     In this book Richard talks about using tea towels but in the other he talks about special bakers' towels. For us beginners tea towels are easier because we all have them at home but in the other book he says that the dough sticks to them. Maybe not if you follow his advice and never wash them!     We don't eat a lot of bread but I hope to be able to try many of his recipes and also to adapt them to the recipes I have from other books! As far as some comments here that he only uses a few types of dough... well, that is what bread is all about! There are a few types of dough to which you then add whatever ingredients you want! The bottom line is... do you want to bake really great bread? Give this book a try, follow the instruction and you will get there in the end!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I've never taken the time to review anything on Amazon. Not because I don't love the site and their products, it's just because nothing has ever reached the threshold to get me to feel compelled to write a review until now. Jodi Picoult is nothing short of a Rembrandt with her use of words to paint vivid and moving pictures of life.    If you've ever wanted to gain understanding, insight or an alternate perspective on such diverse issues as gay rights, evangelical Christian beliefs, in vitro fertilization, suicidal teens, divorce, discrimination and even music therapy, then this is a book to read and savor and ponder.    Picoult weaves a very intricate story into such readable and irresistible passages that you'll be highlighting and happily re-reading over and over again.  The fact that she's incredibly well-researched is evident by her broad and all-encompassing descriptions of current procedures, mores, religious practices and social trends. This lady just flat knows her stuff!    Get it. Read it. Enjoy it. You'll be glad you did.

0783230370|5.0|Junior is a comedy that reunites the team of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito and director Ivan Reitman. In the film, Arnold is a scientist who agreed to take a experimental drug that helps women have babies, and , along with DeVito's help, the results is hilarious. Oscar-winner Emma Thompson(Stranger than Fiction)also stars in this silly but excellent film. Junior is one of the many movies Schwarzenegger is popular as a comedic actor rather than a action star.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|Paul Simon is one of the rare musicians who have maintained a restless, creative spirit and pursuit of perfection into the latter days of his career. He underscores this often - and seemingly effortlessly - on \\"So Beautiful or So What.\\"<br /><br />Raw, bouncy, funky instrumentation abounds, with digital effects, loops and world music beats.  This results in songs that have catchiness and verve before considering their lyrical content. Those who feel Simon should move away from the international sound that has informed the bulk of his work since \\"Graceland\\" will not be pleased, but even if he is not stretching his sonic palette he is nonetheless weaving extremely strong tunes from it. What anchors them, unsurprisingly, are his thoughtful, shrewdly observant poetry.<br /><br />\\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\\" starts the album in an unorthodox note with its crunchy textures and offbeat, unaffected vocals. It sounds as though someone hit the record button in the middle of a jam session.<br /><br />The sitar-infected \\"Rewrite\\" is instantly endearing with its pulsing, swaying production and Simon's moving, unsentimental lyric that wax on the aid of a selective memory in an effort to comfortably move forward in life. This perspective is also glimpses on \\"The Afterlife,\\" which parades along with just as much pep and strut. \\"You've got to fill out a form first and then you wait in the line\\" says Simon of the long journey to \\"glimpse the divine.\\"<br /><br />Not all is rosy and optimistic. On \\"Questions for the Angels\\" - which works effectively as a flip-side for \\"The Afterlife\\" - Simon confronts the emptiness and depravity which cause many to question the purpose of life. This includes images of affluence the poor are pummeled with:<br /><br />\\"Downtown Brooklyn/The pilgrim is passing a billboard/That catches his eye/It's Jay-Z/He's got a kid on each knee/He's wearing clothes that he wants us to try.\\"<br /><br />In the jangly, comfortably ambiguous \\"Love Is an Eternal Sacred Light,\\" Simon does not claim to have the answers as to life's large questions, but finds solace and even humor in the unknowing. The closing duo of the title track and the restorative, gorgeously arranged \\"Love and Blessings\\" sums up the album with similar ambiguity, yet they do not hinge on cliches or cop-outs but rather insist on dignity and acceptance. Admittedly, in Simon's shoes those things are particularly easy to insist upon, but his insights make for heady, pleasurable listening.<br /><br />\\"So Beautiful or So What\\" is not likely to change any opinions of Paul Simon, but it is also one of his strongest, most fully-realized recordings.rs as to life's large questions, but finds solace and even humor in the unknowing.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Pre-release press is not always illustrative of what the final product will be, and \\"Wasted Light\\" exemplifies this. It is not only the highest-octane album the Foo Fighters have unleashed, it also their best. The energy Dave Grohl and company pack is as unbridled as it is inspired.<br /><br />No concessions are made in an effort to garner pop radio airplay. This is angry, cathartic, blood-and-guts muscular modern rock to the core, with absolutely no inhibitions or compromise.<br /><br />Only a few songs stand out from the pack, including \\"Bridge Burning\\" with its deep, penetratingly vengeful lyrics, and the explosive, acid-green \\"White Limo.\\" Rising from a seething ballad into a regretful, piercing blowout, \\"I Should Have Known\\" reunites Grohl with Pat Smear and Krist Novoselic, the latter of whom contributes both bass and accordion; the track thus draws particular attention to itself. The same goes for seamless lead single \\"Rope.\\"<br /><br />On the whole, \\"Wasted Light\\" is an album with a capital A. It's not a record where the singles stand out from obvious album tracks that provide context, but one where the songs build upon each other to create a musical journey leading to a satisfying conclusion, which the crystal-clear, extremely inspired \\"Walk\\" certainly is.<br /><br />The Foo Fighters are becoming more marinated and meticulous in sound and scope. The fluctuations that have occurred within the band's lineup and approach to recording are for the better if \\"Wasted Light\\" is any indication. It sounds in many ways like the Foo Fighters album that was only hinted at, but never quite materialized, in the 90s. This is the definition of well-chiseled, precisely-honed, highly effective modern rock.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|There are those that came into this movie with no knowledge of the previous movie, and there are those that have seen the original movie one too many times, have posters, collectibles, and even tried to find $$$$ to justify attempting to restore that Tron arcade cabinet from the bowling alley down the road.    ( Sadly, no, I didn't get the Tron game.  )    Anyways-- if you're coming into the Tron saga with this movie, welcome!  Sit back, enjoy the movie, oooh at the effects, and don't try and over think it--- it's a nice little movie that has to try and set the stage for new viewers, while living up to the 20 years of expectations that have been festering in certain segments of science fiction fandom.    And for those of you, who like me, can still quote lines from the original movie verbatim, I say:   Just relax, enjoy the movie.   They made a hell of an effort to make enough references to the first movie as fanservice, and they bought modern CGI to bear on the Grid.        I, for one, welcome our new CGI-based grid warriors.
B004H0N4PC|5.0|For the first time in their long career Elbow release an album as one of the mainstays of British music as opposed to a perennial aspiring contender. Its easy to forget that prior to the \\"Seldom Seen Kid\\" their album sales would not have been sufficient to fill a large Manchester pub as opposed to their recent epic homecoming gig at the Manchester Evening News Arena which was one of the most memorable nights in years. In every sense Seldom Seen Kid was a game changer for a band who had looked like they might drift out music lauded with critical praise but lacking mass popular acclaim.<br /><br />On this fifth album they quietly and confidentially produce a record, which shows a band comfortable in its own skin. It does have some echoes of their best album \\"Leaders of the Free World\\" which was packed with big songs and thoughtful ballads, which took a while to register with music lovers, but once they got it they were locked into the Elbow \\"cell\\" with the key thrown away. There was little chance of the band producing Seldom Seen Kid 2 not least since Guy Garvey has admitted that the lead up to the album consciously felt \\"like a last-chance effort last time,\\" and as a result they threw in everything and the kitchen sink. Pressure comes in different forms and follow ups can be equally tricky but on \\"Build a rocket boys\\" Elbow have succeeded and more.<br /><br />All Elbow albums can take months to digest and on the first listens the overwhelming impression is of a slow burn. From there on the songs reveal themselves and even at this early stage if Elbow were to release a Greatest Hits album tomorrow at least four of the songs on here would be shoe in's. The most obvious is the gorgeous centerpiece \\"Lippy Kids\\" the lyrics of which contain the albums title and which is a poignant meditation on being young where Garvey reflects on \\"Stealing booze and down long hungry kisses/And nobody knows me at home anymore\\". It leads to that regretful questioning readily understood to all people over a certain age that \\"Do they know those days are golden\\"? \\"Lippy Kids\\" is worth the price of admission alone, but it is matched by \\"Dear Friends\\" which derives to be played on repeat at least ten times and was is in Garvey's words devised \\"in the middle of a US tour, telling my friends I was thinking of them that day and it made me feel at home\\". It is simply breathtaking and will strike chords with anyone missing friends or family. The other songs which screams out on initial listens are the gentle acoustic heartbreak love song \\"Jesus was a Rochdale girl\\" which rolls along at a snails pace and is beautifully sung by Garvey, the very poignant and emotional \\"The River\\" will leave a large lump in your throat while Open Arms was recently performed on Jools Holland and had the crowd in thrall.<br /><br />Throughout the album Craig Potter and the rest of the band weave those intricate haunting melodies and when they step up to the plate it's a force of nature, The big opener \\"The Birds\\" literally explodes at 5 minutes and is beautifully reprised later with their piano tuner John Mosley bringing an aged fragility to the song. In between you get the second hypnotic Elbow tribute to the late Brian Clancy \\"The night will always win\\" the more expansive mood guitar shifts of High ideals\\" and the swampy urban blues of the punchy \\"Neat little rows\\".<br /><br />\\"Build a rocket boys\\" sees the quality control button on full. Granted it does not represent a huge departure for the band and \\"With Love\\" backed by many voices is a bit Elbow by formula. These are nonetheless nit picking complaints since Elbow has hit a winning formula but it is not one of either U2 bombast or Coldplay repetition. Elbow is a band where the music is about shade, nuances and beauty, as such \\"Build a Rocket boys\\" is a seductive treat from a band that deserve every ounce of success.a certain age that \\"Do they know those days are golden\\"? \\"Lippy Kids\\" is worth the price of admission alone, but it is matched by \\"Dear Friends\\" which derives to be played on repeat at least ten times and was is in Garvey's words devised \\"in the middle of a US tour, telling my friends I was thinking of them that day and it made me feel at home\\".

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The Wait is Finally Over For Foo Fighters New Album! I've been a fan of Foo Fighters since 2005. ( I was 14 then ) I personally like their musical style. I think Foo Fighters are amazing musicians. After seeing the documentary Rock Docs Back and Forth on Vh1 this year, I was like wow really!? They have been through a lot more than I thought through out the years. They have worked very hard to get where they are today, I personally think they deserve where they're at today. Dave Grohl should be a legend by now, he is amazing. Foo Fighters stay true to themselves on this album. Buy this album you won't be disappointed. Wasting Light is one of my favorite albums of 2011. I think Foo Fighters is one of the only real bands that are mainstream ( A band that is known well ) still going right now, and in the right direction musically. They recorded this album the old way, and there's nothing mainstream about that, and that's why I love them, because they define what real music is. Foo Fighters did it the way they wanted to, I'm glad they made this record the old way, instead of the new way, because this album is amazing. They deserve all the success they have achieved over the years. I wish there were more songs on this album than there are. 11 songs just isn't enough for me, and I think many people will agree with me. I love the way Dave sings it amazes me.  My favorite songs on this album are:<br />1.  I Should Have Known ( My favorite song on this album, this song is emotional )<br />2. Rope<br />3. Walk<br />4. Miss The Misery<br />5. A Matter of Time<br />6. Back and Forth

0446693804|5.0|I was expecting to like this book no matter what because I loved the movie so much. I've heard nothing but great things about Nicholas Sparks as well, so I knew I was in for a good read. It was a lot more than a good read. This book changed the way I view life. I was in love with it after the first few pages. I literally could not put it down. I found 3 hours would go by and I wouldn't care at all. Sparks completely engrosses you in his characters Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan. He takes you through the journey of young and pure love. He makes you laugh and he makes you cry in the best ways possible. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
B000RW3YYA|3.0|I did not see SG-1; this is the first Stargate series I have watched. Atlantis strikes me in some ways as a strange sci-fi show. Usually the people who create or write these shows are idealists, and especially conscious when it comes to race, gender, etc. Remember Uhura? Perhaps because Atlantis seems to be mostly set in the present, that isn't true of the first three series. The main characters who have several episodes built around their story arcs or who feature their successes are white guys, Sheppard and McKay. Granted, these two actors are excellent.     The subordinate roles/characters that are frequently neglected are the people who aren't white guys: Teyla, Ronin, and Elizabeth Weir. I was shocked how few skills and accomplishments Weir, the head of the expedition, seemed to bring to the table--all we know about her previous life was that she successfully negotiated peace treaties, but in Atlantis she kind of fails in the one episode (The Game) when that skill would come in handy. In life-threatening situations, she doesn't even try to defend herself, save for an episode in which an alien consciousness kidnaps her body.     Meanwhile, it's weird that all the main Earthlings are white and all the main Pegasus characters are people of color. What kind of weird binary does that set up? Especially since most Pegasus worlds are considered relatively \\"primitive\\" as far as technology goes.      So basically I have political problems with this show. I also think it's weird that so far there is not a drop of romance, after years and years of the show. I know this show is designed for kids, but you have to admit it's strange that none of the main characters are attracted to anyone for more than an episode at a time.     Ultimately, Flanigan is hot and McKay is a great character, so I keep watching.
B003YHCZD6|5.0|I was expecting to like this book no matter what because I loved the movie so much. I've heard nothing but great things about Nicholas Sparks as well, so I knew I was in for a good read. It was a lot more than a good read. This book changed the way I view life. I was in love with it after the first few pages. I literally could not put it down. I found 3 hours would go by and I wouldn't care at all. Sparks completely engrosses you in his characters Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan. He takes you through the journey of young and pure love. He makes you laugh and he makes you cry in the best ways possible. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
0316056863|5.0|I was laughing out loud almost the entire time and could not put it down. I've always found Tina Fey pretty funny, but this memoir was a humorous, clever mix of stories from her childhood, tales about her awkward high school/college years, and glimpses into her experience in show business and surprise at her own success. This is one of the funniest things I have ever read and almost woke my napping child up with my unexpected laughter... great book, Tina!
0307595862|4.0|\\"The Snowman\\", by Jo Nesbo, is a translation from Norwegian and a very good one. If you can get by the seemingly odd names of people and location then you'll find this story to be very readable. However, if you're of the squeemish type then look elsewhere for entertainment as Mr. Nesbo has a flair for describing the uniquely grotesque, sexually tainted, malignant and thoroughly corrupt, and sick, criminal mind. Truthfully, the story got hold of me and wouldn't let go until I witnessed its conclusion. This is an interesting, intelligently written and engaging mystery that will confuse and lead down many a dead end, however, everything comes together at its deliciously compelling ending. A thoroughy good read.
B001AMNL2Q|2.0|I saw this crappy movie just out of curiosity about Vincent D'Onofrio aka Goren in his early days. It's not even worth one viewing. The best part of the movie is the first half, parts of which (I think) are viewable online; and R. Lee Ermey (a real-life soldier in the army) is hilarious as Sergeant Hartmann. I really dislike this movie because it's not a cohesive narrative. There's not one character (except maybe Gomer Pyle) that you can really care about, but even Pyle doesn't get enough screen time. It's just as if there are two parts of an idea assembled in a hurry, and the result is a huge mess. To quote a blurb describing another movie, \\"Scattershot narrative.\\" Worth only one viewing. Not as bad as \\"Scarface\\" (1982), but almost. Rated R.
B003E6K1VK|3.0|I purchased this to use with my Sennheiser HD 650 (300 ohm, high impedance) headphones and found that the FiiO E7 added very little amplification.    I see on the Sennheiser site that their Audiophile Headphones are either 50 or 300 ohms.  The mp3 headphones are 16 ohms.  So this amp may be fine for other headphones.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|Good, not great. Bought Slaughterhouse-five. Unsure if it's worth reading. Pretty sure he covered everything he had to say in this one.
B004NOH9LW|1.0|Not much of a story at all. Three people bumped into each other after having a traumatic experience. What happens next? Nothing.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The show gets five stars. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been mentioned here or by critics; the acting and writing are excellent, the show is well-produced and it is much, much more than just a zombie infestation. The character development and human emotion really take front stage here; the undead theme isn't the centerpiece of The Walking Dead by a long shot. Think of it more as a \\"what would happen if the apocalypse came?\\" type of survival scenario -- emotions running high, tempers flaring, people struggling to maintain their sanity after calamity. It's all very human, which allows the viewer to empathize with the characters on screen. This is a key element often missing from supernatural/horror stories and makes this show truly unique and exceptional.    On to the issue of this DVD's price. There's only 6 episodes (running time is approximately 290 minutes) and Amazon is currently selling the DVD for around $18 - $22 (MSRP: $40). It's fairly light on special features: you get a couple of commentaries/behind the scenes vignettes, a couple deleted scenes, and that's pretty much it. You can also turn on English or Spanish subtitles on the DVD and 5.1 audio (neither of which are available if you download the show from Amazon).     However, you can purchase this show -- minus the extras mentioned above -- through Amazon Video On Demand for $1.99 an episode or $11 for the entire season (if purchased all at once). Given that there's not much bonus content on the DVD, I knocked down the DVD's rating a star. Heck, you can buy all the episodes in HD from Amazon Video On Demand for $14 -- which is still less money than this DVD that runs in 480p.     Again, the show itself is easily five stars. The DVD, however, is not. It's a bit expensive for the amount of content you get, and it doesn't really come with any compelling extras to speak of. If you have a fast internet connection, I would simply buy the episodes from Amazon or another download service and save the $6 - $12. On the other hand, however, if you don't have a great connection, don't hesitate to buy this DVD -- this is one of the best shows on television today.     Update Apr. 23, 2011: Amazon's price is now $9.99 for the DVD. At this price-point, the DVD is definitely 5 stars (and is actually cheaper than the downloads). It would seem that the price on this title changes fairly often -- so check to see which is the better deal (DVD vs. downloads) and make your decision accordingly.
B004BCT2HU|1.0|Don't get me wrong I do enjoy David Garrett (here comes the however!) A few months ago I purchased a DVD and listened to his rendition of some of the rock classics.  All great.  Then I decided to purchase this DVD, thinking I might like to have it as background music when entertaining friends.  It's a yawner!  BORING.  I'm so tired of most of the music he picked... It's all been played over and over and over by anyone with talent.  He's young, attractive, seems to be compassionate and certainly talented, however, if he can't write his own music I'm not buying any more.      By the way, it's only 45 minutes long with two bonus songs ... not worth the money as far as I am concerned.

B0034G4OWW|2.0|What kind of stupid comedy is that??   Negative:   1)Blend of cheap animated CGI animals through almost the whole movie.  2)Directors made animated animals do cruel jokes on main characters.That supposed to be funny.  3)Humans treating animal kingdom like garbage.   4)If you analyze it further, there is some parts which you could consider as animal cruelty.   5)Very stupid music video at the end make me consider that this was done for the small children.  6)Actors smiling in inappropriate moments(when they suppose to scream or do other expression of the faces).  7)The main plot of the movie is similar to many other movies on the market today.  Story:family moves to another town, kid hates his dad for moving to this new place,wife and kid leaves the husband for some time when he gets ''crazy'', kid falls in love, everything stands back on it's place,happy end and everyone loves each other.  I wouldn't advice you show that movie to kids, it's just plain bad. But it's your choice.  8)Other stupid moments, like when the dude dreams at night, his wife turns to him and he sees poorly made raccoon's face. And other moments which you can find in the movie, yourself.  Positive:I laughed whole 3 times.
1416589473|4.0|I'm wary of fantasy novels written to promote game products, but I couldn't help pick this one up while waiting for the release of Guild Wars 2. Having just finished it, I'm glad I did.    The book is fast-paced, concise and efficient. It puts the reader right in the middle of the action, slowing down only for the necessary exposition of the background of world of Guild Wars. I wonder how someone new to the world of Tyria will take all the backstory, but as an old GW player I enjoyed the retelling of the game's history.    Not only is the story gripping, but the plot was woven by the authors very skillfully. Details are not wasted, whether as far as updating people already familiar with the setting or as objects within the story itself. Little to nothing is spent by the authors on anything unnecessary to the plot- that means that what you find in the book has a substantial part to play in the tale while being sleek and streamlined.    The ending of the book is not drawn out, cut down to the bare minimum- this book knows when to quit and it ends well. Speaking of endings, certain twists are revealed masterfully at the end that are guaranteed to make the reader chuckle and smile.    My only critique is that certain elements should have perhaps been emphasized more, such as the main character's relationship to the female lead. The action goes by so fast that you barely notice any romance being built up. Action is fast paced, but romance requires a slow dance. The speed of the book put those two elements at odds, but it's ultimately felt and not completely wasted.    Ultimately, Ghosts of Ascalon is a good book. Fans of both Guild Wars and mainstream fantasy adventure will indeed enjoy this well-crafted, detailed story. It is worth all the money and time a reader spends on it. I am glad to have read this book and glad to have it on my shelves.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I just love this book!     I fell in love with the vampire straight away, this is not like the vampire stories we have read before, his character is so full of surprises as he should be, being 1500 years old. Mathew is a real old fashionate romantic creature who inspires us (the living in 21 century) to seek love in it's pure form and to \\"stop and smell the flowers\\" kind of attitude, small things matter. I wish I could personally meet someone that old and lived through so much.     Diana was a little too stubborn avoiding her gifts in my opinion and I expected her to give up sooner this \\"I-am-not-a-witch\\" mood so we could read more about her powers in action. She was a little helpless and that annoyed me, being next to such a strong man (vampire) should have inspired her strength. And being a historian I don't understand how she wasn't interested more in the manuscript and her gifts. She is very smart, intelligent type of woman who would attract a smart old vampire. I loved every page, their every dialog was fascinating to me. There were more going on inside their minds and hearts instead of outside action in the beginning, which is a plus in this case.    I found the change in Mathew's mother inspiring. Not many people could do that and there was a clear message there - Family must stick together, they supported each other no mater what happens next.    For the time I read this book I felt like living with them not in my world, and not every book does that to me. Totally enchanted me, couldn't stop reading it. I'm looking forward a continuing of this story, it seemed that it has an open end and the author could write at least one more book on Mathew and Diana.     Thank you so much for this book!
0316154687|3.0|When You Are Engulfed In Flames<br />David Sedaris<br /> Those who are not familiar with David Sedaris and the type of literature he produces more often than not have a hard time warming up to the idea of reading a whole book of essays, which is how When You Are Engulfed In Flames (WYAEIF) is described by his publishers. When You Are Engulfed in Flames is David Sedaris' seventh book of collected essays and short stories that would be better marketed and received if it were described as autobiographical journal entries. Albeit the idea of reading a whole book of essays seems cold and unappealing to most readers Sedaris' humor and honesty lends warmth and readability to the essays found in WYAEIF.<br /> Life has a tendency to be false and superficial so when an author writes with honesty it is readily identified and appreciated by most readers. Sedaris in WYAIEF is very honest, to the point of shocking. Embarrassing might be a better word to describe his essays than shocking, because they reveal aspects about his life that most of us would keep hidden, less we die from embarrassment and shame. From his essay about beating a fat polish kid in a swimming competition to the boil on his backside his work exudes a type of honesty that helps the reader identify with him and his awkwardness in this world. Although David Sedaris' experiences are unique to him they often remind readers of their own disasters and mishaps in their lives. Being able to get the reader to identify with the writer with his truth serum is a key to WYAEIF's success.<br /> Where WYAEIF falters is in the absurdity of some of the essays and the flatness of some of the sections. Turning \\"minnows into whales\\" or the mundane into excitement is Sedaris' specialty, but he tends to take some essays too far. He is introspective and can see things in ways most of us do not, which makes him a great story teller but also can make some of his essays unbelievable.  \\"April in Paris\\" an essay about spiders, becoming a spider person and taking his favorite spider to Paris with him is a prime example of how introspectiveness becomes absurdity. But even with all the absurdity and honesty that can be found in the pages of WYAEIF the book has sections that fall flat or drag on putting the reader to sleep. WYAEIF starts off quickly with honest confessions and absurd stories but turns just as quickly into the uninteresting and mundane.<br />  When You Are Engulfed In Flames is not a book for just anyone, but those who take the time to read it will be richly rewarded with honesty and humor. Sedaris writes about his life with honesty, to the point of absurdity. He makes you laugh at him with his stories about his awkwardness in this world and in his relationship. Even when sections of the book dry up and go flat Sedaris can string you along with his story telling abilities. When You Are Engulfed in Flames is an excellent autobiographical story about David Sedaris' life and adventures in this world.<br /><br />(This review was constructed from discussions held by the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club about David Sedaris' When You Are Engulfed In Flames by its administrator on 4/6/2011.)and taking his favorite spider to Paris with him is a prime example of how introspectiveness becomes absurdity.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD and Ripped in 30 together. I like this DVD but you can tell it's outdated compared to Ripped In 30. This dvd only has 3 workouts that are around 24 minutes. Ripped has 4 workouts that are 30 minutes. This dvd doesn't have as much variety. Shred has moves that repeat 3 times. Moves in Ripped only repeat twice in each circuit so it feels less tedious. Ripped comes with a meal plan. Shred doesn't. If you are only going to buy one buy Ripped in 30.
B004OA2G0E|4.0|I'm giving the album 5 stars for being so wild and musically free. I'm giving the physical vinyl that I purchased 4 because there is a defect on the song, \\"Codex\\" that makes my needle jump at the same place every time. I cleaned it with my Spin Clean Disc Washer. Still happens. Confirmed that another person had the same issue on the forum, \\"Vinyl Engine.\\" Wish whoever lathes the records could fix this issue.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|Not the biggest fan of soundtracks; the ones I own have either Star Wars or Farscape somewhere in the title, but this is pretty cool.  Cannot, and will not, compare this to the aforementioned flicks as this is a slightly different type of mood to begin with, but I was pretty impressed by the soundtrack.  The original is pretty good as well.  Both are, in their own rights, unique.  'Visionary', 'ahead of their time,' are not maybe the best catch-phrases to use with this soundtrack, but it is well done considering the movie.  I enjoyed the music enough to own it on CD.  And it is what it sets out to be; the background noise to a movie.  If it were more than that, it would not need a MOVIE to have been produced in the first place.  I thought the music fit the movie to the proverbial \\"T\\".  If you didn't feel the same, that's cool.  Just my opinion.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This DVD is a treasure for all fans of musical theater.  I saw Les Mis' on stage three times and still love it - the music and performances from this DVD are flawless.
B00006JMQG|5.0|While I dig silent films, many modern moviegoers feel no interest in them, this is not a bad film to have them cut their teeth on.    Its unique visuals and twisty turny plot should keep them interested.    The Tim Burton and *sigh* ...Twilight fans may well enjoy the sullen eyes and high contrast lighting. Oh the joy that is German expressionism.    And the ending, while not spoiled here, will give the Inception junkies something new to debate.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|Hi,     While some of you might think its worth getting this camera just because it is durable, consider what the purchase of a camera really is supposed to mean.     The owner is supposed to be able to take pictures that they can look at it with fondness and memories. For kids, they are using it because its fun to capture these things.    My son was afraid of the pictures he took.     Because of how terrible the internals of this camera are, pictures come out blurred with the slightest movement. The flash absolutely white washes out anything closer than about 3-4 feet and everything further than that is too dark. The only place this camera is ok is outside.    Battery life is terrible. For such a small screen and for such little quality, there is no reason the battery power has to be so terrible. The fact that you can't put a card in it and you HAVE to use a USB cable to transfer AND charge is also terrible.    That said, for $50 you can get a real camera. Not a great one, but one way better than this. You can also pay square trade to put an accidental warranty on it for probably like $10 for a $50 camera (with no claim charge). Believe it or not, my 3 year old son puts the string on his wrist with every camera he uses that has it. He's done this since he's 2. Kids are more careful than you think if you take the chance to explain something to them and watch them.    I completely regret getting this for my son. He's used it a few times and the pictures are actually really something he doesn't like to look at.     STAY AWAY
1401223176|4.0|Hush is a fine fine comic. It brings in bits and pieces from throughout Batman's history while making up many new bits out of whole cloth. Somewhat in the style of Loeb's work with Tim Sale, it does not quite reach the heights of those classic tales, but it comes close. Plus it gave us a good new villain.<br /><br />I recommend it to any fan of Batman, but would advise reading Loeb's earlier work and Batman Year One first as your introduction to the character. A certain familiarity with the bare bones of Knightfall and Death in the Family wouldn't hurt either.
0312600844|5.0|Perfect combination of text, metatext, syncopated humour and wit which is probably lost on most people.  His turn of phrase is subtle, yet sharp as a whip and Katz's one-liners totally threw me off my perch and made me laugh out loud on quite a few occasions.  Wonderful.<br /><br />Jonathan Franzen scored again.  At least with me.  :-D
B00065GX64|5.0|A thoroughly excellent Crime drama, covering the police and the criminal fraternity's attempts to track down a child-killer played by Peter Lorre. (It should be noted that those that call Lorre's character a pedophile seem to have vastly misunderstood which pathology that term covers).    Beautifully shot, competently acted, and logically igniting discussion from its actual content, not from the arthouse \\"interpretations\\" but from Lorre's impassioned closing speech.

B0040QYROK|5.0|I cannot say enough about my love for Metropolis, or the sheer joy I felt upon hearing about this restoration. I LOVE Metropolis. It offers a still unique vision of the future, and frankly impressive special effects, and a central melodrama certain to entertain. This is Lang's masterpiece.    It has a wonderful soundtrack that resonates deeply with its images. It will stick with you.    While the film is intensely entertaining, its message is often found confusing. Is it pro-communist, or anti-communist? Its simpler than that. It calls for basic human decency to connect those in power with those underneath them. That is a simplistic message, but one that I think will always hold resonance.
0698116496|5.0|I bought this book because the Pre-school teacher wanted to read it to her class. I work as an aide and I love children's books. She read it to both classes and they loved the story. The book has very little words, so they kids have to look and tell what is happening. I enjoyed the story as much as the kids and so did Miss Judy the teacher. If you have a children 3 to 5 who loves pictures and animals this book it worth the money.
B000068OCS|1.0|This film is a tumor. This film is the ultimate expression of everything wrong with \\"art\\" films.<br /><br />This is the ultimate triumph of \\"message\\" over substance and story.<br /><br />A million dollar compendium of glorified stock footage that ends with a slow view of an exploding rocket ship that seems to almost mock the deaths of those involved.<br /><br />This is a film illustrating pure and utter contempt for human life that exists beyond a primitive tribal state.<br /><br />This film is Anti-Life, its like art made by the friggin Anti-Spiral.<br /><br />If you think this film is good, and not just parroting the usual tripe of modern film criticism, if you think this film is good by your own honest opinion you are either a sociopath or a hipster. Or maybe you were just mercifully misinterpreting into something less soul-crushingly bleak.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I abosolutely love this movie.  It was the perfect love story.  I liked it so much, I also got the book.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|My mom bought this for me a few years ago (maybe 5) she's a big infomercial person so my xmas gifts are usually things like this...and the bullet and tap lights, etc.  This one I acutally use and really love! We have tile floors, a huge dog and a toddler. I use it every night to sweep up the floors after dinner and I use it on the tile before I steam clean them (using my Enviro-steamer which is awesome). It acutally has a really strong suction, sucks up cereal, dog hair, food the baby drops, and just about anything I roll over.  I have a really good vacuum but on the tile, this works much better.  I do not use this on carpet so I'm not sure how it would work on that. I love the swivel handle and it's really easy to empty. Last night we had cornbread at dinner which my toddler crumbled and blanketed all over the floor. The swivel sweeper picked it all up and is so easy to use. Maybe I'm just lazy and don't want to use a broom and dustpan...but I really think this works better. Mine is getting pretty old and beat up and it's just made of plastic so it's not the most sturdy appliance.  One of the gray clips on the top has broken off. It still works fine but dust can come out of the hole on top where the clip was so I came to amazon to look at purchasing a new one. Even though it's got a piece broken off, I'm still giving it 5 stars because it does everything I need it to do, and for a cheaper infomercial product,it's lasted 5 years which is pretty good.
B00371QQ0M|3.0|I enjoyed this movie as a kid, but not as much when I saw it again years later.  Great quality on Blu ray.
1936594293|4.0|So...what to say about this. Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy? Hmm....
B004UXXVQS|4.0|this is a solid set of tunes from foo fighters.  AND, i love the media blitz that has come with it.  i can't get enough of these guys.  and if you haven't caught it.. look for back and forth airing on VH1.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I have been using battery grips on my DSLRs since the original Canon Digital Rebel.  I cannot imagine shooting without one.  The added weight helps to steady the camera (especially with a longer lens mounted on the camera) and I am very comfortable in knowing that I will have enough battery power for any job.    I have used some of the off-brand grips in the past - and will never do so again.  When it comes to something like this, you just cannot beat the quality of the manufacturer.  It was certainly worth the difference in price!
B004BBDHEK|5.0|This is Yanni doing what, I think, he does best: instrumental music.  Yes, there are pieces with vocals here, but instrumentals are still his greatest strength.    Many people say that this album is not like Yanni's other work, and it's not.  It's new.  Yanni had grown and changed over time, and his music had changed with him.  It's not like he can just do the same thing over and over again.  This album may have some new sounds to it, but there're enough similarities to remind us whose music this is.    I recommend this album to anyone who likes Yanni or any kind of music that can transport your mind to other places.
0385341008|5.0|Thank goodness for the bookseller at the airport that just from a couple of titles I gave him was able to figure out that I'd like this book.  So much that after the 3 hour flight I didn't want to get off the plane because I hadn't finished the book!<br />This is a great story set in WWII but in a setting not discussed very often.  Not Poland or France or Russia...but a small group of islands off England.  What is interesting about this book is that it doesn't necessarily portray german soldiers as ruthless nazis which we've already seen in many books and movies.  In this book, they are men who signed up for the service in their country and who now are fighting in a war.  The characters is Guernsey were all great, quirky small town people which I love, always love books with this small town feel-good stories.  This book is also dramatic because you can't forget about the war in the background, of course, but it allows us to see how those that weren't in the battlezones went on with their lives.
B002ZG9940|3.0|Bought \\"The American\\" on BLU RAY today on the strength of some good reviews, but mother of God is it slow - even tedious. You know you're in trouble when the 10-minute \\"Making Of\\" is more entertaining than the entire film itself.<br /><br />So why watch it at all - let alone suffer it the whole way through? The answer of course is George Clooney. Since \\"Three Kings\\" and particularly \\"Michael Clayton\\" (see separate review), it's become obvious to movie lovers everywhere that gorgeous George is more than a pretty face - and given material he can get his teeth into, he's a top-notch actor. He's again superlative in \\"The American\\" - a brave (no make-up), restrained and almost colder-than-Hell performance that keeps you glued to the screen - even if it feels like forty minutes have passed without anything actually happening.<br /><br />Clooney plays Jack - an assassin, a mechanic, a man who can also makes weapons that will skillfully deal out death someplace else. Jack's not afraid to pop a slug or two into a lover's back if needs be. And an event in Sweden forces him to do just that - so he must contact a man in Italy that he trusts. This man sends him out of Rome in a plain car to a small town up in the Italian hills to hold up while things get 'sorted out'. And on it goes until 'they' eventually catch up with Jack and his newfound connections in the peaceful hamlet - a growing relationship with a local woman that may even offer him redemption...<br /><br />On BLU RAY the picture quality is almost surreally beautiful. Corbijn has a very stylized way of filming - lots of side profiles of faces, a man sat in a caf&eacute; with the night street lit up outside like a Hopper painting - the Italian hills and buildings looking almost as arid as Spain or Portugal rather than lush - giving the feel of edginess, sparse, almost hollow - like his character. There's silence almost all of the time too adding a sense of danger to quite ordinary scenes. Close-ups are superbly lit and intimate - making Clooney's almost expressionless performance all the more chilling...<br /><br />But unfortunately, most of this good stuff is washed away by some staggeringly stupid plot bits - an American in an empty town like this would stick out like a sore thumb and have local tongues wagging (especially one who looks like George Clooney). The most sexually exciting and gorgeous woman in the entire town (who would have every red-blooded Italian male pursuing her like a pack of rabid dogs) turns out to be a prostitute (great stroke of luck for George there). She is - yes you have guessed it - a tart with a heart. There are completely unnecessary sex scenes with Violante Placido that linger on her lovely truepenny bits way too long. And again down by the river - she gets her top off once more. It's gratuitous stuff than irritates rather than titillates. There's a shooting match in this tiny town one night and a very destructive car chase (with a dead body left in the wreck), but no one mentions this the next day - no Police check. The elderly town priest befriends him, but may have a past too - so he does what any Italian priest would do - he doesn't rat out the killer (give me a break). And who wants Jack dead anyway or why - no one seems to bother telling you. So as you can imagine, all of this style over substance makes it difficult to care. Even the film's name seems lazy and oddly out of place. And then it all ends with a very clich&eacute;d image that leaves you feeling a little cheated...<br /><br />\\"The American\\" is not a bad film - it just promises more than it delivers. And you can't help but feel that with a cleverer script, it could have been genius.<br /><br />Yet on the strength of \\"Control\\" and this, I feel certain that Anton Corbijn will one day deliver exactly that...almost expressionless performance all the more chilling...

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I judge books based upon my ability--or lack thereof--to put them down. This book was so good that it made me want to read at every waking moment. And it ends at this huge cliffhanger! I was not ready for the book to end so I've already re-read it.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|am not a fan of modern sci-fi so did not want to particularly see this, but I had friends over who had brought this and 2012. We watched the latter first and whilst it is a high octane, action fest amid an orgy of CGI it was ultimately uninspiring and vapid.<br /><br />Then we watched the low budget CGI and action free zone that is 'Carriers'. This is nearly a brilliant film but for all the reasons that most lovers of the sci-fi horror genre will not like. This is the relatively short story of a group of four teenagers on a road trip to the coast in a post pan endemic afflicted world where (like 'Survivors')most of the worlds population has died or is likely to be dead any time soon. I can see why so many people felt disappointed with this film as it was billed as some sort of Zombie/ horror flick and actually is neither.<br /><br />That is the backdrop but this is actually more of a moral study on how selfish and fragile we are as people. They are all rather unlikeable as characters but the more that comes out the more you can understand them. The two brothers are the central characters but the character development is done in tiny snap shot exchanges and you have to concentrate to pick it all up, there is little in the way of flash backs. Brian (the elder jock type - goes on to be the young Capt Kirk in one of the Star Trek spin offs) seems to be running away from the past as well as the disease and he is the alpha male who lays down the rules that ultimately mean they will all lose so were the rules right in the first place? Was anything right in the first place could be a secondary underlying question? But the human spirit certainly takes a kicking in this film, and you might need a cheer up afterwards. That said I found this totally watchable, and even a bit brave in the way it did not pander to the mid ground and very much like 'The Road' tries to show just how bad it would be and the heart rending decisions that you would need to do to survive. So I actually liked it, but so many people don't that you would probably be able to pick up one 'as new' from Amazon Market Place for a song.so many people don't that you would probably be able to pick up one 'as new' from Amazon Market Place for a song.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Great album overall. The sounds of Mumford and Sons is something you can't find somewhere else. It's calm and exciting, smooth and rough at the same time. Amazing album that I'll be listening to for a long time.
B003UY0ZFS|4.0|I will not write a huge review but simply say- I heard a few of the songs while in a cafe in Istanbul the other week. Instant attraction! I bought the album and have listened to it a few times since. It is good all the way through. I look forward to future albums.
B000022TSV|5.0|We have been searching for this version of Carmen for several years.  It is the  best movie of an opera that we have seen.  The fact that it was filmed in Spain and not on a stage makes it superior to any we have seen.  The quality was as good as what we saw at the theater in 1984.  We have seen it 3 times already and have loaned it out to several friends & family.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Starting to wonder if it is possible for them to release an album that sucks?!?!?  DOUBT IT!!!   All of the tracks are awesome and uniquely Foo.  My own favorite is I Should Have Known which is totally about Kurt Cobain but yet Dave claims it is about all the relationships in his life with the band.   Anyways, great album- Well worth the purchase.  I bought mine at Best Buy to get it today and because the have a 2-disc edition that includes 1 remixed track(if you dont like club music, you wont like the remix of Rope) and a new track called Better Off which is good.  Also had 2 videos- White Limo and a live version of Walk from the Roxy.  Lastly it also included a small clip of the actual tape used to record the album.  So for $2 extra dollars, its worth going to Best Buy.  Otherwise, do whatever it takes to get the album to your ears!!!

B004UXXVQS|5.0|I am a big fan of the Foo Fighters from the beginning. I liked their first album - self titled - back in 1995 and then THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE in 1997 clinched it. Since then life has taken over and I stopped listening to them. That's the best reason I can come up with anyway. I went to the library last year (2010) and checked out ECHOES, SILENCE, PATIENCE AND GRACE (2007)from the library on a whim, and OH MY GOODNESS, they haven't lost that sound that drew me in at ALL. \\"Rope\\" is just a blistering song with great change overs, familiar, but different feel than other FF stuff and I CAN'T wait to listen to the rest. Just take 4 min 22 sec to listen/watch \\"rope\\" here on Amazon. It just gets better and better. My birthday is coming up, I'd like either this album WASTING LIGHT or IN YOUR HONOR as a gift. Anyway, all the Foo Fighters albums are a good place to start, but if I had to pick one (and it's more because of familiarity than anything else) I'd say start with ECHOES, SILENCE, PATIENCE and GRACE.

159562015X|3.0|I bought two copies of this book, for myself and a friend. I had heard great things about it from pastors and friends; what I have read is great.  However, the book is really only useful when you have the access code for an online test. Once that code has been used by one person, it cannot be used by anyone else.  Basically, I now have two books that do me absolutely no practical good.  I just ordered two copies straight from Amazon and greatly look forward to combining what is written on the hard copy with what the \\"test\\" shows online.  Personally, I think Amazon should remove this book from being offered used.  I was/am rather frustrated, as you can understand.  But, I recommend the book.  BUY NEW THE FIRST TIME.
0380725398|5.0|Few readers of similar genres will find disappointment in Jamaica Inn.I remember reading Du Maurier when I was in my teens half a century or so back and something made me recently pick up Jamaica Inn. I could barely put it down. I was quickly caught up in the tangle of plot and character and emotion- woven together so very well it seemed to flow right around me, over me, through me- and I thought of all the newly written novels- no offense intended- about which a main selling point is, \\"Wow! You won't be able to put it down!\\" This is the real thing. If you've been reading similar mystery/drama that stops at simply taking you through the motions of the plot without fleshing out detail- even characters- novels which when you read that last page, you know what came to pass but it somehow feels empty and leaves you wanting, this is a book for you.     I agree, by the way, with the writer who said \\"You've just given away the entire plot.\\" This is not an English class book report, folks. It's a way to express how we all feel about the style, the nuances of a writer's skill. I'm amazed at how many reviews do reveal the entire book. Man, that's like taping a favorite ball game or film- only to have some moron with \\"spoiler\\" on his breath happen along to tell you the ending before you've popped in the DVD....Lol      For an entertaining and very personal and candid glimpse into Ms. Du Maurier from her childhood into her early twenties, do read \\"Myself When Young,\\" her first autobiographical work. Experiencing the young Daphne and her youthful interpretations of her world will surely enhance your understanding of her  characters and plots.
B004SCI9BS|3.0|I'll say this. The song \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" is absolutely infectious, one of those things you just can't get outta your head. This means it is awesome.And now I'll say this too: I have no clue what the rest of these songs are doing on here. Luckily you can just buy one song. I think I had some of these songs on LP when I was in high school....I hate to knock anybody past three stars and the best song is really a 5 star so do the math.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|First Lee Child Novel as well as first in the Jack Reacher Series for me. For the first 20% of the book I thought perhaps I had over estimated my expectations of how great I thought this book would be. It seemed slow and at times boring but then it started to get interesting. As I got further into the book, the more interesting and exciting it became. Jack Reacher is an interesting character and I've already started another Jack Reacher Novel to see where it takes him next.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I love the reviewers who always have to first provide some \\"proof\\" of their \\"authority\\" as a true fanatic.  First off, it is NOT Pink Floyd.  And if the farthest back you can date your fanaticism for Floyd is The Wall, that automatically disqualifies you.  \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene.\\"  And while I agree the lyrics are not as profound as Floyd, I was a lot younger then, too.  These lyrics are not as cynical.  True Gilmour was somewhat under-rated as a guitarist, but then again, he is skilled and he has a \\"trade mark\\" on his own sound.  Did you hear him when he played with Pete on Give Blood from White City?  There is only one Gilmour and if you listen carefully, he is still very much alive in this CD.    Time to move forward and try new things.  It is not so off the wall like some of Byrne's stuff.  Remember, it's the \\"fans\\" that never let them go and inevitably killed Hendrix.  Dave is older now and he's mellowed.  But for old folks like me, while I still like heavy music, I also can appreciate he is writing in collaboration with his wife and something along the lines of easier listening.  But, it still has a mood.  Still has a sound all his own.  If you're starving for hard Gilmour signature bends, go listen to Animals... like I do... when I need that fix.    In the meantime, give it try, but do so with an open mind.  It is more atmosphere and less \\"black light\\" district.  To be honest, I had a hard time at first.  I was to busy being a \\"fan\\" with expectations.  But after listening a few more times, it has grown on me and now is a regular play.  For certain, if you are looking for Floyd, you won't be happy with this.  But they're never coming back.  Have you seen Waters lately?  I'd say Gilmour looks a bit better.  And if you want a study in Floyd, go listen to the Sid days, but you won't find Gilmour there either.    I only marked this a four because it isn't quite the same heavy lyrics, nor the same heavy guitar.  But it is very much Gilmour... and he is stillvery much alive and well.

0812550706|4.0|Orson Scott Card is not an excellent writer. [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] does not stand with the likes of [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]] or [[ASIN:B003G4ILH6 1984 (Signet Classics) (Mass Market Paperback)]]. But it is a sci-fi, messianic story worth telling. Ender is a third in a society with strict population control. He comes from a family of genuises, each one washed-out from a careful selection program for future military leaders. Eldest brother Peter was ruthless, and tortured Ender for all of his six years. Sister Val was too soft, unable or unwilling to kill. Ender's temperament is more moderate, making him the perfect candidate to lead humanity.<br /><br />A majority of the novel takes place in Battle School, where simulated space-fighter games train young boys into soldiers. The title character is the youngest in the school, but head-and-shoulders above the class intellectually. Ender tries to bond with his classmates, but they are either bullying or irrationally jealous. If Ender succeeds, it is humanity's success. If Ender fails, they all fail.<br /><br />Occasionally, the author's insistence on vernacular (e.g. using 'you' in place of 'your') distracts from the narrative. Orson Scott Card is too interested in delving into ethnographic territory with the 'buggers' an enemy of earth from the first and second invasions. There are a multitude of stories, but no lengthy subplots. [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] is at its best when the focus is on the fleshed-out main character. Everyone else's purpose is advancing some aspect of Ender, who is clearly a messianic figure to the Mormon-influenced author.<br /><br />Ender is a book that most will finish in a day or two. The plot is fast-paced, the prose simple, and those who take the time to read are likely fans of the genre. What can be debated is whether or not the twist added or took away from the arc of the story. It was all wrapped up rather conveniently at the end. It is a fine story, but lacking a master storyteller like Issac Asimnov. Recommended for anyone interested in science-fiction, military theory, or psychology.lacking a master storyteller like Issac Asimnov.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I loved this movie. I don't think the beginning dragged-- in many ways it was my favorite part. Robert Schwentke knows how to create a quiet yet hilarious scene and Bruce Willis pulls it off stupendously. This is the type of movie my dad and I have termed, \\"Sarte meets Van Damme.\\" It has everything that makes a movie well done and fun. We have an excellent cast, excellent writing, and excellent plot, and fresh exciting action scenes. Lots of wonderful bangs and booms, yet we like the characters and easily get into the story. I laughed myself silly throughout. I will most definitely be buying this movie very soon.

When I first started reading to my baby, I wondered why this book is such a big hit.  Well it's because it illustrates so many concepts (up/down, thin/wide, awake/asleep) without being so obvious like the very simple board books.  This book is adorable and teaches your child so much.  Mem Fox has many fantastic books (we also love Koala Lou, Possum Magic), etc. and this is a perfect start to your child's library.

B004K4IZ54|4.0|Lets just get the elephant in the room out in the open. Do NOT buy the 3D edition unless you have a specific Bluray player that is 3D compatible (A PS3 is good to go). I have a good Bluray player and assumed you would simply watch the movie with 3D glasses. My mistake. I'll admit it. You have to have the special 3D Bluray AND the fancy 3D glasses to watch it. Not the old school 3D glasses that you use for any other 3D movie. So if you have these 2 extra options available, feel free to buy the 3D copy.<br />EDIT: Someone told me you have to have 3 items. The 3D Bluray, 3D Glasses and a 3D TV??!! No thanks.<br />Movie:<br />As for the movie itself, I don't know why some people are having such issues and are giving it low ratings. It is a well made, well acted film. I was impressed with the CG, younger version of Flynn (CLU). They completely rendered a younger version of Jeff Bridges who is the program that Flynn created called CLU while at the same time, Jeff played Flynn (The original creator) as well who has aged 20yrs since the first movie, Tron.<br />Small spoiler: Tron is still running around in this film but they keep his face hidden by a helmet for almost the whole movie. If you pay attention to the Tron action figure in the beginning, you will know Tron is still around in the cyber world.<br />I really enjoyed the 2D Bluray. This is the kind of movie you want to see on Bluray.<br />Special features: I would expect a bit more for souch a big budget film but there was enough that you will have more to watch after the movie is ended. There is a must-see extra called \\"Flynn lives\\". Nuff said there.<br />If you haven't seen Michael Sheen in any movies yet, he is a great character in this movie named Castor. He is good in most everything he does.<br />Also, you do not have to watch the original Tron to enjoy this movie. It can stand on it's own if needed. It helps and is recommended to watch Tron first but you don't have to.<br />A must buy for the Tron fans and anyone wanting a good scifi film on Bluray.Bluray.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|David Gilmour's 2006 solo effort ON AN ISLAND picks up right where Pink Floyd left off with their final album THE DIVISION BELL. Gilmour's distinctive, soaring guitar sound is matched to his laid-back, somewhat hushed vocals, singing lyrics by his wife Polly Samson. It's mostly an ambient event, and even when the guitar is at its most active, the backing tends to be samples or Dick Parry's cool saxophone; rarely does a vigorous rhythm section appear.<br /><br />Gilmour doesn't really strike out into new territory here, but his talents are considerable enough and his sound is individual enough that one more album from him is a welcome and entertaining event. I see there's some complaints about the lyrics, which are indeed twee, but this album generally works by setting a chillout mood and I at least and never drawn to pay attention to the exact words.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|How much you enjoy this is based largely on your expectations. I would not place this near the \\"indie\\" section where it resides, simply because to me this deserves to replace the current definition of \\"mainstream rock.\\" I would be just fine replacing Creed, Nickelback, and whatever comes next in rock bands claiming blues roots.<br /><br />Black Keys are the definition of blues rock. This is not a breakthrough release that really deserves another category, however, it is the best thing in blues rock since Zeppelin's debut album, and it's not a sound-alike anywhere near Wolfmother territory either (though, for lack of a better indie-meets-classic-rock comparison...).<br /><br />In recent years Black Keys branched out to work with two prestigious producers, Dangermouse (Attack and Release) and Dame Dash (Blakroc), who are largely more associated with electronic beat-driven music, and in particular hip-hop and r&b type of sounds. On Brothers, however, you are witnessing this group returning to their original sound, with a strong degree of reinvention.<br /><br />So, you can no more expect this to somehow be \\"rap influenced\\" than you can expect \\"the same old Black Keys.\\" Get over it, and do not sleep on the album of the year. You won't be able to listen to any other indie chart topper with your parents in the room, so live it up!

The reason I say this is all the vocals sound like cookie monster is singing.

0671004107|3.0|I think this is a three or four-star book.  I have mixed sentiments.  The first time I read it, I remember being impressed by the witty dialogue on the issue of religion and science, the reasons to doubt as opposed to the reason to believe.  Religion and believe makes up an important theme of the book, and Sagan's insights (as expressed through the characters) are important and still useful.  But in another sense, Sagan is merely substituting a more impersonal, science friendly religion for what he perceives to be an older-time worn formula for religion.  His caricature of religion seems to omit that anyone could have a liberal sense of religion, and focuses mostly on the fundamentalist view.  I just wish the book weren't so \\"chatty.\\"  Honestly I think it could have been edited to be much shorter, more succinct.  In a nutshell, I think there are important themes of religion and science here, and that it is a still a worthy read - if also a mildly flawed one.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|When was the last time you stood up for yourself? A classic movie about a corporate tool deciding to be an individual. Inspiring and thought provoking. Now shut up and deal.
0525422943|3.0|This isn't going to be a great review. I just thought the book was, eh-- ok.    I loved If I Stay, and I had high hopes for Where She Went even after I found out it was from Adam's point of view. As much as I loved him in the first book, I just couldn't take all his whining in this one. Although, to be fair, I believe his whining was warranted...    I would have given this book one star had it not been for the last 50 pages or so. I'll give the first 200 pages a 1, the last 50 (or 62) a 5, and kindly average it to a 3.    The last part of the book was truly beautiful and really unexpected. I'll give Mrs. Foreman that.    I'm not upset that I read it or anything-- I just feel slightly disappointed is all.
B004529NKC|1.0|In my opinion, the movie was badly acted, had a terrible cliche plot, and the dancing was so overboard it was silly.  One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|One of the few TV series that holds my interest and has a cast that melds well.  Most of the newer shows may be OK but not worth my money to own.
B004RUF9DC|1.0|This review is not about the film it's about the Blu Ray.  After seeing \\"King of Kings\\" 1961 restored to Blu Ray, and the great job that was done on \\"The Robe\\" from 1953 no less, as well as plenty of other titles that look pristine, this is total crap.  This Blu Ray does not have film grain, that is DIGITAL NOISE, that the studio didn't bother addressing. I had my DNR and MPEG Noise Reduction set to high for this, and it didn't help.  I'm so sick of trading in my old DVD's to buy Blu Rays, and I end up getting crap like this. I'll bet even the VHS is better than this.  Sometimes they just don't take the time, \\"Spartacus\\" 1960, a disappointment. Thankfully they fixed \\"Gladiator\\".  Now if they fix this one, we will have to go buy yet another copy. I haven't viewed \\"The Ten Commandments\\", but I'm not worried because I've seen the positive reviews.  I don't know what's going on with Fox restoring MGM's Blu Rays but they are hit or miss totally.  \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" 1962 looks great, while \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" is almost as bad if not worse than this disc. I would say be wary from now on when Fox is releasing MGM Blu Rays.
B000L3GLOU|5.0|Nice 1/32 scale model of the famous Spitfire. Pieces need a little work here and there and the detail is basic, but with after market parts, it will come up a treat. Good model for a good price.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I did not order this from amazon, I received it as a gift, but Lost in my opinion is the best TV series ever. Having it in high definition blu ray makes it even more amazing! There are many special features and a hidden bonus disc. I think there are quite a few hidden \\"easter eggs\\" included on the discs but I havent taken the time to find them all yet. The box itself is full many exciting things, even before you get to the actual discs. I recommend this to anyone.
0307346617|2.0|Although fairly well written, the dominating social agenda is highly distracting.  This book is far more concerned with criticizing government (and government entities) than telling a fun and fictional story.
B003PGNBNO|5.0|Demi Lovato is my favorite female vocalist and I also love the Jonas brothers so this movie is amazing since it combines both! I actually like the songs better on here than on Demi Lovato's solo albums (even though some of those are pretty good). This is a way better movie than the first camp rock. the first camp rock was too cheesy in my opinion (even though the song at the end was really good). if you like demi lovato and the jonas brothers, you probably already have this movie. If you don't have it and like them, then get it!
B004N66XYE|5.0|Like almost everyone worth their weight in Hudson's silver polish, I went euphoric when I heard about the revival of the greatest TV show of all time. Now after I've seen it (all three episodes....jeez, we wait our whole lives for THREE episodes?) I have to say this: the \\"new\\" Upstairs Downstairs has charm, it's likable, and above all it has huge potential to be a great program. I have no idea if additional episodes are planned but by all rights there ought to be more soon since they'd sure be welcomed around the world. The cast in this revival was terrific, the era of its setting has much for writers to work with, and I for one loved seeing so much more of the house (really a cast member in itself) than we ever did in the first Upstairs Downstairs. The revival isn't perfect, of course, but though I'm a purist I'm not here to complain about this second chapter in the legacy of 165 Eaton Place, instead I'm confident that if we ever have the glorious opportunity to see more of this modern series, it'll get better and better as it unfolds. To Rose and 165 itself, I say WELCOME back! To Lady Agnes and Sir Hallam, to Mr. Pritchard, Mr. Amanjit, the charming new cook and the firecracker housemaid, I say HURRY back!
B004V2S4SS|5.0|WOW!! That's what I have to say about this amazing series! I had no clue it would run 7 seasons due to being slapped around by NBC for its first 5 years.  It premiered back in January 2005 as a mid-season replacement and its first 16 episodes were simply astonishing!  Patricia Arquette played Allison DuBois excellent.  It was almost if the dead were omnipotent!  Every where she looked she saw a dead person good or bad, lost or confused and tried to at first block them out by drinking!  After NBC canceled the show in May 2009 (although it was outperforming their other shows) CBS picked it up for its remaining two seasons.    Back to season 7 (the final season), was just simply amazing!! The writers, actors, directors and producers all worked hard as hell to produce one of the finest prime time shows of the 00's and 10's. Season 7 began right where Season 6 ended as Allison continued to recover from her brain tumor.  Her eldest daughter Ariel went off to college this season and we got to see more acting from the middle daughter Bridgett. The first episode \\"Bring your daughter to work day\\" was a take on the film \\"Freaky Friday\\", that being said, Bridgett and Mom switched places and it was nice to have a comical relief after all the sad ordeal that ended with season 6.    The series continued to get better with each episode.  We got to see more details about Detective Lee Scanlon's life and how he and his deceased brother were treated as children, and his precious daughter Lee by Lynn whom he married.  Another great episode was \\"The Match Game\\", in this episode we see Allison seeing hearts on people's foreheads and thinking they are matched and fate is working, but does it work for the greater good?!?    Personally, one of my favourite episodes is \\"Talk To the Hand\\" when Allison gets a skin graft and her hand goes wild.  The coffin scene is absolutely funny even though this is a crime show, a bit of humour now and again always helps.  \\"Where were you when...?\\" was an episode that left a chill in almost all who like Medium.  It brought back memories of catastrophic events and after Allison thinks a mega quake is coming she later learns a bomb is in a parking garage.    As the season progresses, we learn Joe's mother is dying and this little detail goes back to Season 4 episode \\"Burn, Baby Burn\\" in that when Allison told Joe's mother that she would be alright after she confided in Allison that she had to stop by the Mayo Clinic on the way back to Michigan.  I think that episode \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" was one of the saddest in the season.  Laura San Giacomo  made an appearance in \\"The People in your Neighbourhood\\".  Laura is remembered for \\"Just Shoot Me\\" a 90s sitcom.  This episode wrongfully accuses a convicted sex-offender of molesting her daughter. But, the question is who really hurt her daughter??    As the 2011 episodes approached after a long break viewers realized the show was coming to an end.  We got to see Allison's brother back, but this time it was her real life brother David Arquette, the great actor from Scream!  I think they should have cast him as her brother originally, but that's just my opinion.  Allison and Joe had some troubles too in the remaining episodes over Allison going back to get her law degree and Joe getting his masters.  I think we can all agree on the last episode unless you haven't seen it, which I won't say much, but it is very bittersweet!  I hope the DVD has an extended version of Episode 13 like they did with Season 1 episode 1.  I really think a Series Finale should be 2 hours not one! Remember that Kelsey Grammar just kidding, but seriously it should have been two hours to get everything in.    The good thing about Season 7 and the whole series was watching the whole family change.  They were a true life family, faced hardships like everyday people do.  They lived in a modest house, struggled with jobs and had plenty of ups and downs along the way.  The daughters grew which was wild seeing Ariel go to college when you sit down and watch Season 1 as compared to season 7.  She really grew up! Bridgett became more funny. I think Maria Lark has a comedic career ahead because of her whit and she just cracks me up.  The littlest girl Marie grew up to become a good actress too.  She didn't really have many roles, but in Season 6 we got to see her act in the episode \\"Sal\\" where she fell in love with the Alarm system the DuBois family installed.    Overall, I give the whole series 5/5 because for everyday people it dealt with everyday issues from the economy, the wars, crime, struggling to find jobs, money, and dealing with teenage children and young children.  Jake Weber and Patricia Arquette had a great chemistry together and I would recommend that you order this today or go out and buy it June 21, 2011! Season 7 comes full circle and I for one am glad the show got a proper finale instead of just canceling it!  It brought closure to the show and didn't leave us wanting more like some series that just end!  I believe if CBS hadn't moved it to 8 pm on Friday nights and left Ghost Whisperer run for a 6th Season, then Medium would have got its full 22 episodes.  Now that the Supernatural shows are practically gone, my question is what kind of shows will be next? As reality shows are starting to wane, it makes me wonder what the 2010's will have for us in the coming years! So get ready and get Medium the 7th and Final Season this year!! Au Revoir Medium!!  Maybe Ariel's character will do a spin-off? We will see!    P.S. I forgot to mention Season 7 will be in Blu-Ray too!! I hope they release the other 6 on Blu-Ray as Well!! And for Patricia and Jake, I wish you two long and happy careers!! You both did amazing jobs making this series! Thank You both!
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I first watched this movie when I was about 10, and I was totally blown away. It was in the old VHS format, and I never got tired of seeing it, enjoying it as much as I did the first time. Fast-forward some 15 years, when on a whim I decided to re-watch it just to see whether it would stand the test of time. I'm very happy to say that this is one of those (relatively rare) movies that never gets old!     I've seen it many times as an adult, and I like it just as much as I did when I was a fairy-story-obsessed kid. David Bowie's flawless performance as the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly's beautiful, headstrong Sarah are the biggest reasons I never get tired of this movie, but Jim Henson's puppets and the magical challenges of the Labyrinth itself is what makes a good story become unforgettable. A must-see!    As an aside, I admit I've had a long crush on David Bowie ever since I first watched this movie at age 9 or 10. See it, and you'll see why! :)
0670022411|1.0|This overly long book of nothing may be the worst thing I've ever read, and having grown up on Anne Rice, I tend to like a good witch/vampire story and can handle \\"a little wordy\\".  From the start you are overwhelmed with adjectives as this writer takes the writing 101 idea of \\"show don't tell\\" to the extreme.  The main characters - even with the adjectives - remain one dimensional throughout the book and by the middle you don't really care what happens to any of them, least of all Diana.  With 587 pages a reader would expect a lot to be going on but unfortunately, page after page, is dedicated to how each character smells, the yoga classes they attend, the meals they eat, the bottles of wine they drink, the clothes they wear, the number of stairs they have to climb to get to a tower.  They drink tea and make tea.  They look at books, work on laptops, and recite obscure classic literature.  There is even a few pages dedicated to our main character, the witch Diana, waiting in different rooms for her vampire boyfriend, Matthew, to return.  Simply waiting.    Besides the nothingness of the story, the author loses track of details and contradicts herself as well repeats conversations between the characters.  A few examples of this are the unnecessary detail that vampires don't have fangs only to continuously describe their sharp teeth, and at one point \\"elongated cuspids\\".  In a single paragraph one character is described as having three sons for the second time although four are named.  A conversation of regret over not expressing love that comes towards the end of the book is inexcusable when compared to prior events I can't name without giving away to many details, and one character is given an entire back-story only to be treated like a stranger a few hundred pages later.  On top of all of that the author seems to have done little research into Paganism.  A powerful line of witches - going back centuries - would not need a vampire to explain to them the lore of Lilith.    Although not a fan of Twilight - I still can't help but feel Ms. Harkness also borrows a little from the Stephanie Meyer world of vampires.  She started out with an interesting concept but had no idea how to make what could have been a fantastical battle between creatures actually appear on the pages.  I read this as a book club book, but would not recommend it to anyone else looking for a good read.
0316098337|4.0|I loved the idea of this book. I have a toddler so I did relate to the mothers emotions and reactions. I got shivers and cried in parts. BUT... I hated how it ended. One of those books that just ends with no satisfying conclusion (for myself, at least). Besides that, I didn't get that distracted with the book being in the childs point of view like some of the other reviewers complained, rather I thought it added something special to the book.

B004K7HMJ6|5.0|Subtlety you will not find on this record.<br /><br />What you will find is a plethora of upbeat and slow, catchy, vaguely British, sometimes clich&eacute;-- but always entertaining songs that will either make you want to get up and dance or scream along to in your car with the top down. It's the perfect summer album.<br /><br />Jessica Cornish aka Jessie J has been working for almost six years churning out hits for artists like Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera. Jessie is no overnight success. She's put in the years of hard work. Her versatility both in style and music choice is one of my favorite things about Jessie, which is ironically the very thing she's been getting the most flak about from critics.<br /><br />I like that she doesn't sound the same on every song. I like that \\"Mamma Knows Best\\" has an underlying Motown feel while the hard hitting \\"Do It Like a Dude\\" is a hybrid of hip-hop/pop. What some critics are calling \\"lack of direction,\\" I call variety. And it's not like you're going to find an opera bit on here, these songs are all definitely within Jessie's comfort zones of r&b, pop, Motown and hip-hop. As a caution though, if you were expecting the entire album to sound like \\"Price Tag\\" or even \\"Do It Like a Dude,\\" then you will be in for a surprise.<br /><br />While sometimes Jessie's overly simplified lyrics can get on my nerves, what is undeniable is Jessie's vocal talent. Her voice is never lost in autotune or \\"corrected.\\" Jessie knows she has a good voice and is unafraid to showcase that. While she's not Adele or Amy, Jessie blows the roof off in comparison to other mainstream rivals like Ke$ha or Rihanna. Sometimes it sounds like she does vocal riffs just to show that she can, but it doesn't get on my nerves--I'm simply happy to have a mainstream artist that can truly sing.<br /><br />Jessie J has talent. That is undeniable. Aside from simply the different styles of music that Jessie incorporates, what I appreciate most is the heartbreaking vulnerability mixed with swagger for days that resonates throughout the album.<br /><br />Whether this album's particular brand of delicious pop is for you is a different question. If you like positive, happy, upbeat, girl-power type music--then I highly recommend you take this ride with Jessie J.is the heartbreaking vulnerability mixed with swagger for days that resonates throughout the album.<br /><br />Whether this album's particular brand of delicious pop is for you is a different question.

0756405890|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read.  The characters and plot are interesting and engaging.  There is a great flow to the story where, just as you start to feel comfortable, something surprising happens.  There is also a lot of clever foresight that goes into it such as pulling in seemingly trivial details with great cleverness later on.    The author is fun and witty beyond belief.  His world is also very functionally believable which is often a problem for me with other fantasy books.  Much genius goes into his work and the characters are intelligent with good dialogues featuring logical fallacies, linguistic mechanics, and plausible but entirely invented systems like magic in a friendly and approachable manner.
1439102724|4.0|I am a lover of Picoult's books and have read most of them. As one who has read many of her books, I have come to expect a few things from her in a lot of her books; great character development, chapters told through the perspective of different main characters, some kind of legal/court case, a controversial topic of the time being covered, a twist at the end, and usually some tears from me (because of the events happening at the end of the book).  This book had most of those elements, but less than usual character development, no tears, and the twist wasn't *twisty* enough.<br /><br />This is the story of Zoe. She was married to Max. While they were married they wanted children but both happened to have trouble with their end of reproduction, so they used an alternate route; IVF. After trying and failing with that, the couple got divorced. Zoe wanted to keep trying, but Max did not and wanted out of the marriage.<br /><br />Max was a recovering alcoholic, so with the divorce, he went back to his old ways and ended up living with his brother and sister-in-law as well as finding Jesus and an evangelical church. Zoe, on the other hand, after being depressed for a couple of months, made friends with a school psychologist (whom she knew through her job) which evolved into more than a friendship. After they traveled out of state to get married, Zoe wanted to give the 3 remaining frozen embryos to her wife, Vanessa, so they can have Zoe's biological child(ren). When Zoe asked Max to sign consent, he suddenly became interested in the embryos and the rest of the story is their legal battle.<br /><br />I liked the book, but I didn't feel as connected as I usually do. I think Zoe and Vanessa's perspectives of the trial, their relationship, and the reactions of others felt real and honest. Max's character seemed realistically *changed* (as you hear born-again Christians talk about) and yet still struggling with not only his alcoholic tendencies, but also his uncertainty about his ex-wife's new relationship and the trial in general.<br /><br />As for the left wing vs. right wing debate that I've seen other reviewers get upset about...get over it. Just because the story has gay rights portrayed in a positive light does not mean the author is waving a rainbow flag in your face. It just means she has taken a controversial issue, as is her style, and given one FICTIONAL perspective. Apparently she chose a good topic if it gets everyone all riled up :)<br /><br />The ending did not wrap up all the loose ends for me like I wanted it to, the way Jodi usually does. Also, I didn't cry. There wasn't a big *twist* at the end...it just wrapped up in one of only a handful of possible ways (and I'm not a person to \\"predict\\" endings; I read books for the story, not to test my foreshadowing abilities).<br /><br />As for the CD that accompanies the book. I waited until I finished the book to listen to it (I was reading too fast and didn't want to stop to listen). I listened to the entire CD this morning, flipping through the book to see at what point in the story the song was intended for. I think the CD adds a bit to the book. It might work just as well to listen to the tracks as they correlate with the book. The singing is nothing spectacular, but I think that might be the point. Zoe, a music therapist, would be a good singer, but nothing spectacular either. The lyrics (which Jodi wrote) fit with the story well and add a bit. I think it's a fun twist on a book.<br /><br />Overall, not the best Picoult book I've read, but still a good one.onship and the trial in general.

So they rig up cardboard \\"bookshelves\\" and had them \\"fall\\" on the dogs owners and the owners pretended to be unconcious-would the dogs call 911?-No they all just stood there and acted cool.This is supposed to show that dogs have no real sense of emergency or what to do.

The film is fast paced and the score adds to the suspense and atmosphere of the tension that is portrayed in the subject.  I would describe the film as crisp and straight to the point.  The film portrays very well the racial tensions that existed at that time.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in human rights.  The relationship between the characters played by Gene Hackman and William Dafoe is also extremely clever.  I was fascinated by both characters and the way each approached the situation from totally different perspectives and struggled with their own feelings. A film to be watched more than once or twice.

I recall as a youngster putting young bulls in squeeze chutes to be castrated into steer, providing the \\"Rocky Mountain oysters\\" used by cowboys to bully and tease Temple as a young woman.<br /><br />At 2 1/2 a neurologist referred Temple to speech therapy \\"my mother could see I was making progress.\\" At age 4 Temple's mother was advised to institutionalize her as she would never speak. \\"My mother refused to believe I wouldn't speak. Then when I finally spoke she Made me go to school. In school, at home, manners and ruleswere really important. Table manners, please, thank you were pounded into me, I was very lucky. Mom worked hard to be sure I was engaged. She knew I was different, not less.<br /><br />My mother pushed me to become self-sufficient (Miss Bingley in Pride and Prejudice demoting Elizabeth Bennet: she has a self-sufficiency without fashion which I find intolerable). I worked summers at my aunt's ranch, for a seamstress (learned to embroider horses on her clothes), in an autistic school, at internships; mom wanted me to learn work skills.<br /><br />Instead of fighting I learned to cry, I had to or I wouldn't have had a career (also see [[ASIN:B0040J1RZO Dhamma Brothers]] meditation for self soothing, documentary of 10day course with 10year follow-up) and [[ASIN:B00013RC84 Nell]] with Jodi Foster's commentary.<br /><br />I didn't want to go away but I went to college, have a masters and PhD. I invent systems to treat animals with respect. I write books.\\"<br /><br />Professor Grandin's memoir moves from dark days, acceptance of her limitations at each life transition \\"I'm scared of change, it panics me\\" and her decision to design ways out of darkness. Her commentary in Special Features expresses gratitude for 30 years of antidepressants to calm sensory overload panic attacks. David T Wong published the first article in 1974 on fluoxetine (Prozac) which was approved for release by the FDA December 1987. Chronic fluoxetine use promotes neurogenesis (production of new brain cells) which, if not killed by alcohol nicotine caffeine, support continued learning in adulthood.<br /><br />\\"Temple Grandin\\" was filmed at her aunt's ranch, the site of her invention of a calming \\"hugger\\" (altered squeeze chute without head bail) to cope with daily panic anxiety. The film makers discovered her first squeeze chute overgrown with ivy in the weeds on the ranch with \\"TG Enterprises\\" painted on the side. Temple's colitis permits eating only Jell-O and yogurt for weeks at a time. Born in 1947, with age and her mother's constant pushing, Temple's range of coping skills increase, her public speaking and social interactions continue to markedly improve even in her 60s. She learns rules to smooth social intercourse (you have to wear clean clothes, deodorant put on her desk \\"use it\\"), no alcohol nicotine caffeine.<br /><br />Claire Danes viewed childhood videotapes of Temple repeatedly, listened to the changes in voice and observed altered posture which occured as Temple matured from 14 to 35years. Voice and movement coaches trained the actor to recreate aging bodily without cosmetics or prosthetics. Temple Grandin \\"People who've heard me speak say that I speak better now that I'm in my 60s than when I was in my 50s.\\" Temple continues to improve as she chooses to accept the challenges of change: travel for public speaking, writing for publication. Normal brain cell development isn't complete (fully myelinated) until 30yo. Temple's new antidepressant generated brain cells (neurogenesis without neurotoxic alcohol nicotine caffeine) are now reaching full maturity and supporting continued learning in her mid60s.<br /><br />Temple's haptic experiences crawling through cattle pens, allowed her to translate cattle reactions to reflections off water, sun glinting off chains, shirts and changing colors to invent humane holding pens, stocks and dip tanks, publishing articles, books (her first book was Emergence) becoming a world recognized animal behaviorist.<br /><br />Temple Grandin's successes, hopes, dreams are realized by deciding to walk through challenging doors each day, every moment, suppressing sensory overload from noise, lights, internal visual images using coping skills she invented or was offered by those who care about her: it's just another door, if you choose to walk through it will open to whole new worlds.<br /><br />DVD describes true story of autism evolution through the intervention of animals, scientist mentor, abstract thinker aunt, and the faith of her pushy tiger mother.

0670022411|5.0|I read a lot of novels.  Good, bad, ugly but A Discovery of Witches was one of the best and most entertaining reads I've found in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  The background of the characters and the details of their lives is extraordinary.  I would recommend this for anyone.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I was confused by so many reviews, and the different versions of this title that are available.  So let me be clear that I purchased the, \\"Digitally Restored Edition\\" released in 2010.  I watched this on my Sony Vega (CRT) television, and I thought that the color and sound were just fine.  Each episode of the story is presented with the opening and closing music and the credits, just as the original series was.  I was very satisfied with the presentation.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Watching \\"The Matrix\\" more than a decade after it was made, my first thought was to how well the film stands the test of time. Granted, it has only been 11 years. But ideas about cyberspace have become more sophisticated, just as they have become a part of the daily lives of more people. The internet has become indispensable and mobile, whereas it was more esoteric in 1999, when \\"The Matrix\\" hit movie theaters. The cell phones were bigger then. People still had hard lines. And \\"hacker\\" had not yet become synonymous with Eastern European cybercriminals. The word still conjured up images of a sort of amateur insurgency in cyberspace that sought out information about hidden worlds. That is what the hackers of \\"The Matrix\\" do.<br /><br />It begins with two voices speaking over the green glow of a computer monitor. \\"Are you sure this line's clean?\\" one says, hinting at deception. Then to Earth's dystopian future, where a beautiful hacker clad in black vinyl, possessed of seemingly superhuman abilities, fights with police and flees federal agents to a phone booth, where she disappears. After that jolting introduction to stunning, dark production design and gravity-defying martial arts, we are transported to more familiar territory. A sleepy hacker has dozed off, when his computer appears to send him a message. \\"Wake up, Neo,\\" it says. And \\"Follow the white rabbit,\\", which he does. He follows a punked out young woman with a white rabbit tattoo to a loud party where he will meet his destiny.<br /><br />It was quite an opening. Larry and Andy Wachowski, who wrote and directed \\"The Matrix\\", relied on imagery and ideas that the viewer would recognize to bring us into the world of the Matrix, while they created a truly beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic that audiences would not soon forget. \\"What is the Matrix?\\" is the nagging question that will drive Neo (Keanu Reeves) to discover that his world is not what it seems. He is a prisoner of illusion, a slave of an enormous system of inhuman machines. Kind of abstract for an action movie. But \\"The Matrix\\" cyberpunk tone, its stunning visuals, combined with themes that have variously been interpreted as socialist and capitalist, Christian and pantheist, postmodern and crassly commercial, give it staying power.<br /><br />A decade later, perhaps it has more meaning when a federal agent calls Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), fugitive hacker and hero of the rebellion, a \\"terrorist\\". And now that the Info Wars are upon us, the idea that hackers will save the world by revealing its hidden recesses, is either all the more naïve or all the more likely, depending on who you think will win. Politics and post-modernist themes aside, any viewer who was unhappy with his or her job could, then and now, relate to the drudgery of the Matrix. It's one of those rare, good, character-driven actions movies that has wide audience appeal. And it would be a mistake to underestimate the power of the film's beauty, courtesy of cinematographer Bill Pope and production designer Owen Paterson. That's what keeps bringing me back.Kind of abstract for an action movie.

0756404738|4.0|Only the third of this book keeps it from being a 5 star novel. Near the end, however, it just dragged a little IMO. Still highly recommend both this and the previous book in the series and cant wait for #3.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This album is amazing from start to finish.  Pat Smear is finally back in the fold on guitar after a 14 year exit from the band in 1997 and is a much welcomed addition.  Butch Vig's production is top notch.  I love that this album incorporates the craziness and raw energy of the very first album (which, in case you were unaware, was basically a Dave Grohl solo album) and that the triple-threat of Dave, Chris & Pat's guitars are front and center in the mix.  Nirvana veteran Krist Novoselic's amazing bass is guest featured on the song I Should Have Known.  As always, Taylor plays a mean set of drums.  My favorite songs on the album are Back & Forth and Walk.  What I like most about this album is that it's a mixed bag.  You go from in-your-face songs to beautiful melodic songs and back again throughout that entire album.  I would spring for the deluxe addition if I were you.  The bonus track, Better Off, is also amazing.  Also, if you haven't seen it yet, I would recommend seeing the Foo Fighters: Back & Forth documentary which is very entertaining and contains behind-the-studio footage of them recording this album.  Happy listening!!!
0316056863|5.0|For the record, I love Tina Fey.  I love Liz Lemon even more.  I laughed all the way through this book.  It's written in Fey's signature witty style; I kind of felt like I was reading a long script of a 30 Rock episode.  And that was fine by me.  Aside from the great humor, Fey writes about her journey into showbiz in such an honest way, from working a dead-end job (I'll never be able to look at a YMCA building in quite the same way) to doing improv for small, stone-faced audiences.  So it's pretty inspirational, given that she has fought her way to the top of American comedy in the past couple of years (oh how I want to go to there....).  Can't recommend it enough.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Within Temptation is one of those very rare bands that has the guts to self-invent themselves every album. Besides Sharon's vocal that is so recognizable anywhere, WT's music is very much different each album.     So after hearing this for a while *smirk*, like a lot of people I was very confused with the overall musical concept of the song. I mean seriously, 80's rock? I want to hear Sharon wail like a battle maiden as if the whole worlds depends on her operatic vocal to win wars! How the sound of a whole ensemble of orchestra is behind her, screaming with their instruments trying to keep up with the sound of the band!    Where did THAT go!?    Alas, my cynical bias starts to fade after awhile as songs, one by one, starts to creep into you like past WT's album. They still have the ability to hold you in a bliss of power vocals that just takes you away. At first, it would seem that Faster wasn't the obvious choice as the first single. But how it beautifully tells you that they \\"...can't live in a fairytale of lies / And [they] can't hide from the feeling cause its right\\" with such powerful vocals just stupefies me to a wonderful sonic oblivion.    The song also makes me wonder; how is she going to sing this song live?    You can find a sense of their past work in other songs like \\"Where is the Edge\\", \\"Iron\\" and \\"Stairways to the Skies\\" and sparingly in Martijn Spierenburg's keyboard playing through out the album. And that is probably how far you will find their old style because they're still one of those very rare bands that has the guts to self-invent themselves every album. And with that in mind, the album becomes another original entry to their repertoire and with very solid songs.    The limited edition DVD is also worth the extra few bucks featuring several clips and the whole \\"mother maiden\\" videos. It's just too good to pass up.
B004INNRFK|5.0|I was able to get the CD and the DVD for $16.00. The music is good.  I wish it were a little longer but still a very good value especially for a gift if someone has not seen the Hit Man Returns show!!
B002ZFQD0Y|5.0|I think that this Cd + dvd, is an awesome buy, not only for the singer, Serj Tankian, which i think is one of the best singer this times, but for the orchestra and the bonus dvd.    I think, that people who liked System of a Down, will also like this too.    PS: Sorry for my English, I'm an Spanish customer.
B0000BXGCN|5.0|I love the power of Lara Fabian's voice.  The songs on this CD are wonderful and it does not bother me that they are in a foreign language.  I like this CD!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|worked great for a month but now crashes immediately upon opening. only solution is to uninstall and reinstall which deletes all save data :-( hopefully next patch resolves problem
B004GYY714|5.0|This is by far my favorite app!   Radio from all over the world -amazing.  I am now listening daily to fitba matches from o'er the pond and the BBC.  Thanks for the app Amazon - braw!
0385733577|3.0|The story has great potential, but the writer could have done a better job.  It's definitely not one of those books you can't stop reading.
B001EO748M|5.0|Season 2 was wonderful. Highly recommended. If you liked season 1, you will loved season 2. The Tudors continues with its drama, dash of sex (homosexual scandals introduced in Season 2), suspense, and character development. As for Queen Anne, Season 2 showed us Karma is very real.    Enjoy!
0345528581|5.0|This book is perfect for those people wanting to exercise in a simple yet very effective way. Gym memberships are expensive in my country, so I wanted to take a different approach to my training. The book is truly a bible of bodyweight exercises, but the part that really does it for me is where Mr. Lauren lays out four different programs based on one's level of fitness, it's a great starting point, and he gives the guidelines to designing our own program based on our own needs and abilities. Nobody argues about the efficiency of the exercises and the programs, the only criticism the book has got concerns the use of household items such as chairs, shelves, brooms or doors for exercises, in the authors defense he does advice the reader to use such items ONLY if 100% sure of their safety, I think what the author is proposing is that with a little creativity and will one can find a way to do the exercises with few if no equipment, but I think in future printings he shouldn't shy from advicing the purchase of a few items, that are (in my opinion) necessary for making the best out of his program. Those items would be a chin up bar, a dip station and an interval timer. If, like the author states, you are saving tons of money from cancelling your gym membership, and the program he proposes aims for keeping you in shape for life, what's the matter with spending a little money on equipment that's useful for as long as you use them? If one wants to make some changes in life, like being on the best shape ever, one needs to make some sacrifices, be it time, effort, or money.
B004G6009K|4.0|I don't know if it is because I'm a man or if it is because I'm an adult but I would have liked this movie much better if there was some none stop action. The action that is there is good but I would I loved to get more. Not enough bad guys against good guys fights to me. At the end, the movie feels short. I almost thought that the horse and the cameleon were more interesting characters than rapenzel. My daugther loves the movie. The 3D is good, again not enought stuff popping out of the screen... when are we gonna get a movie that is interesting and at the same time with stuff popping out of screen every minute of so ... that would be so cool.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Hard to say that this is \\"the best\\" Foo Fighters album because, after so many years, bands should really be defined by eras.  I would consider the Foos first era ending, and second era beginning, with their double album, In Your Honor.  Their \\"classic\\" album from that first era is The Colour and The Shape.  It is considered, and will continue to be considered, a classic album in the rock genre.    Wasting Light is the best album of the Foos second era and, like TCATS, it will be considered a classic album in the rock genre.  There is no track that is unlikeable, just a few that aren't as great as the others.    Highlights of the album are the first two tracks, \\"Bridge Burning\\" and \\"Rope\\", are the best two songs I've heard to open an album since way back to the first tracks of \\"Vs.\\" by Pearl Jam, \\"Go\\" and \\"Animal.\\"  \\"Dear Rosemary\\" is solid, the guitar work sounding a bit like \\"Steady As She Goes\\" by the Racounteurs, and a chorus that is all Dave Grohl, even with help from Bob Mould.    Thrashy and well-placed \\"White Limo\\" is juxtaposed with the ridiculously catchy \\"Arlandria\\" (\\"you and what army? Arlandria!\\").  \\"These Days\\" is such a great, soaring rock song that it is easy to forget that the lyrics are painfully honest and relate-able on a number of levels.  \\"Back and Forth\\" is cheesy, but in a catchy, good way, and sounds like something of a homage to any number of late-80's rock tracks with it's chug-chug-chug guitar sound (listen to it, you'll get it).    \\"A Matter of Time\\" to me is very Foo-sy, that is to say, it could have been on just about any of their other albums and fit right in.  \\"Miss the Misery\\" is just...fantastic.    In as much as I love the opening two tracks on the album, I've never heard on any other album closing tracks as good as the deeper, more emotional two tracks that end the album.  The album is bookended perfectly.  \\"I Should Have Known\\" is believed to be about a close friend of Dave Grohl's (not named Cobain) that died of an OD within thelast two years.  It is a tugging, beautiful song that absolutely soars when his old bandmate Krist Novoselic's bass makes its presence felt about 2/3 through the song.      Closer \\"Walk\\" is my favorite in an album full of favorites.  Perhaps because I'm in my mid-30s, my perspective on the song is that it sounds exactly like the words of a person who sang \\"My Way Home\\" from The Colour and The Shape would 14 years later.  Someone who was \\"not scared, I felt like this on my way home\\" now has responsibilities and children and a fear of death.  \\"Walk\\" encapsulates that sort of maturity, wisdom, growth, etc.  In typical Dave Grohl fashion, the guy who has the rock star credentials and \\"rock god\\" status worldwide does the complete opposite in the very un-rock-and-roll like lyric \\"I never want to die, I never want to die!\\"  He defies the rock-n-roll persona in his words as much as he personifies it in his music.  It is as close to a perfect, uplifting and emotional song as I've ever heard.    Someone else mentioned this, and I totally agree: it has been YEARS since I've heard an album and considered it a \\"new favorite album.\\"  This fits the bill perfectly.  Over 20 years of collecting music and more than 1,000 albums, this just instantly sat in with the handful I can listen to anytime, anywhere, and love from start to finish.
B004E547D8|5.0|it made a long long time that I haven't looked at such a good action movie. the kind of movie you can watch 10 times in a row and still enjoy it ... buy it.
0545123275|4.0|Shiver is an enticing novel between a human and a wolf. The relationship between the human and the wolf is forbidden love.<br /><br />Grace and Sam have a different kind of relationship, a relationship that cannot be tangible. Grace is human, but Sam...he's a wolf. He is able to change to become human, but not on his own. It is determined by the weather. Grace knew Sam since she was younger because Sam saved Grace from the wolves mauling her. Now that they are in love, what's stopping them? The age in wolf years? The weather?<br /><br />I couldn't really get into this story until midway through. I thought the beginning was slow even though it explained a lot about Grace and Sam. BUT the other half made up for the beginning half because it was really good. I enjoy reading both sides of the story in Grace and Sam's perspective.<br /><br />I actually liked Sam more than I liked Grace. I like the idea that he's a wolf and wolves can change into a human at times. The downside to that is that he doesn't have a lot of time left with Grace. The romance between Sam and Grace really picked up midway through the book and that really made up for why I enjoyed this book. Their romance is pretty different and sweet even though they have to live the way they do because Sam is a wolf. I enjoyed how Grace was able to remember who her wolf is since she was younger until she met Sam as a human. I think there were many good details about the relationship between Sam and Grace and that was what it made it a pretty special relationship and book.<br /><br />I'm actually looking forward to the next book and more about Sam and Grace! :) Great book!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|good movie. double face character is kind of wierdly put to me. It is very disturbing to me to see the man that had so much values being so easily broke and convince by the joker to become a bad guy ...
0802798225|5.0|I love, love the main characters, Alejandro (Alex) Fuentes and Brittany Ellis! I think their relationship has so much sparks and they were willing to step outside their safety zone and do something different for a change.<br /><br />Alex and Brittany's worlds are divided into the different sides of time, the wealthy neighborhood and the \\"bad\\" neighborhood with gangs. Alex is living in the \\"bad\\" neighborhood and Brittany in the good side of the neighborhood.<br /><br />I rarely see interracial relationships in books. Usually, they all stick to the same racial background, but Alex and Brittany steps out of their comfort zone and found love with each other. Their relationship sounds so sparkly and they give a giggly feeling to the reader--to me at least. Words cannot really explain their relationship. I really enjoyed reading about interracial relationships because you can then get a sense of different racial backgrounds.<br /><br />Everything about the book was p-e-r-f-e-c-t, even though there were things happening between Brittany and her ex-boyfriend, Colin. She saw how different it was after a summer without Colin and she quickly knew that it wasn't going to work anymore between the two of them.<br /><br />Despite Brittany have problems of her own (with her personal life/family life), she still manages to be the \\"perfect\\" person/girl. Her peers just don't know what's really going on in her life.<br /><br />Alex has his own battles to fight. Being in a gang is pretty difficult and he has a reputation to withhold. In addition, he joined to protect his family.<br /><br />Everyone has their own stories to tell and Brittany and Alex has their own as well. I loved how the author incorporates so much about these two characters and what their lives were like. I felt that it was easy to be able to fill one of their shoes.<br /><br />Great book! Must read! This book really puts me into the lovey-dovey mood. '

B004529NLG|4.0|the 3D is many times awsome in this movie. I loved the battles as well as the time when the colored drinks comes up at your face. the plot in general is pretty bad.    Nothing better than movies filmed with the panasonic 3D camera ...
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a long and detailed history of cancer. My mother died of cancer a couple years ago, so I am interested in the topic, and I found this book easy to read, even though it's quite long, and very interesting. There were times when I kept reading long after I should have been doing something else.

B004K7HMJ6|5.0|This is an amazing debut album release by the British-born talented pop/r 'n b singer-songwriter Jessie J, titled 'Who You Are'. The creativity/songwriting, vocal range & its beauty make this album hold its own against other greats like those of Rihanna, Beyonce &  Christina Aguillera among others if not better! This amazing CD (13 tracks) opens  with a solid track/gem \\"Price Tag\\" (wonderful pop/r 'n b track, great vocals reminiscent of Rihanna or Aguilera). Other solid tracks/gems include \\"Big White Room\\" (beautiful ballad, great guitar & great vocal range singing. This a personal song for Jessie J, about her experience as a 11 old patient in a hospital losing a fellow patient in the same room), \\"Casualty Of Love\\" (wonderful slow tempo track, great vocals), \\"L.O.V.E.\\" (incredible beautiful track, wonderful melody, great vocals & lyrics! This is my favourite track from this amazing CD) & the title track/first single \\"Who You Are\\" (beautiful ballad, great guitar & wonderful vocal range singing). Great tracks include. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" (great high pitched vocals), \\"Abracadabra\\", \\"Mamma Knows Best\\", \\"Stand Up\\" (great harmonies) & \\"I Need This\\" (great ballad with great vocals). Okay tracks include \\"Rainbow\\", \\"Who's Laughing Now\\" & \\"Do It Like A Dude\\" (a reggae inspired track reminiscent of Rihanna's \\"Man Down\\"). On overall, this is an amazing debut album release by the talented singer-songwriter Jessie J, a highly recommended CD listening. A well deserved 5 star performance from an amazing debut album!

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I am not a music critic but a fan of Foo Fighters. Having all their albums through the years this is an evolution of their music. You can feel its more mature with more layers than previous years but still keeping all that is Foo Fighters intact. There are parts that are more rock than previous albums, if thats possible, take heed young emerging artist this is how its done.     All in all a Foo fan will not be disappointed.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|This is one great series. The ensemble cast is really outstanding. Jon Hamm as Donald Draper is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen. At once dispicable and flawed, and at the same time noble and redeemable, he is by turns maddeningly clueless about relationships and incredibly astute about the ad biz. Elizabeth Moss as Peggy Olsen portrays a young woman who sees the possibilities for women in general and herself in particular at the beginning of the women's movement of the 60's. The sets and costuming are well researched and the whole feel is very true to the era. The fact that the writers include major events ( Cuban missle crisis, JFK death) of the time and their effects on the characters is also a good feature.   I highly recommend this whole series.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|\\"Spartacus:  Blood and Sand\\" plumbs the depths of shamelessness in its hunt for an audience.  It steals its broad storyline from the demi-classic Stanley Kubrick film.  It steals its visual effects - gallons of blood and comic-book violence - from Zack Snyder's adapation of Frank Miller's \\"300.\\"  It steals its proud dedication to T&A from soft core porn.  And it steals its stilted dialogue and declarative voice from the lesser chapters of Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillion.\\"      And yet, the darn thing grows on you.    Perhaps it's the game cast.  Andy Whitfield, who could ably serve as Brad Pitt's body double, takes on the title role with a certain wooden-headed gusto.  John Hannah throws himself into his role as Batiatus, owner of Spartacus's gladiator school, with all the oily charm he can muster - and that's saying a lot.  Watching Hannah, among the most charming and endearing of actors, sink into depravity like a snake is a rare treat.  Lucy Lawless - yes, the warrior princess - embodies the plotting Roman spouse as Batiatus's clever wife Lucretia.  These two attempt to out-Nero Nero as they drink and love while plotting and murdering their way up the social scale.    The other gladiators are a chiseled bunch of lunkheads, given to much snarling and flexing whilst covered in gleaming oil.  The physiques and the acting are both worthy of an NFL locker room.  But these gladiators are so obviously gladiators that we stop expecting this to be another PBS production of \\"I, Claudius\\" and instead lower our expectations to see what these MMA refugees can do.      Ultimatley, once you accept \\"Spartacus:  Blood and Sand\\" for what it is - an R-rated comic book aiming for low pulp rather than high art - it becomes entertaining.  Sure, you may hide your copy your boxed set of \\"The Wire\\" or the colleted films of Akira Kurosawa when the parents come visit or if you have the pastor over for dinner.  But you'll also find an excuse to watch more often than you might think.
B001RNO7C6|5.0|I have been looking for a waterproof low profile shoe for a few weeks and stumbled upon this one. These were bought for an upcoming trip to Alaska. They fit just like a sneaker but are more durable with the Vibram sole, which if they are anything like my 13 year old Asolo's will never wear down. I have tried other brands like Merrell and Keen and they were always loose in the heal or toe box. The full leather and rubber toe cap seem as though they will protect the shoe no matter what I put them through. All in All a very well put together shoe.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|I just saw this movie, coincidentally with a similar, newer one called \\"The Speed of Thought\\". Liked them both. This movie was bigger and had better effects, but the other movie had a lot more heart and soul, and was more unusual. Oh, and had better acting. Hayden Christensen is kinda lame. Sorry, Hayden. On the other hand, Jamie Bell is great. And I loved that song at the end, \\"Blackened Blue Eyes\\". Funny how the right song at the end of the movie can make you feel better about the movie...

B00005N6KG|4.0|These are fine headphones.  Very lightweight and comfortable.  The wire coming off the left side tends to get in the way, so I secured it down with a twist tie.  The top part does feel a bit flimsy, but I've had this type of headphones before, and that doesn't really become a problem.  I've only used them for a little over a month, so time will tell how rugged and durable they are.  Regardless, the price was amazing (much cheaper than in the stores), so I'm not going to complain if they do wear out during the summer... I'll just buy another.

193413712X|2.0|\\"Tinkers\\" was hard to get into. I don't understand how it won the Pulitzer Prize. (My book group felt the same about it). The story was interesting but sometimes the language weighed it down.<br />The idea of following a person's thoughts as they are about to die; reviewing their life, starting to let go, is fascinating, and I'm sure almost anyone has a loved one who has gone through this. However,<br />it seemed like the author became side-tracked, and the writing was bogged down in several parts, going<br />off on tangents instead of sticking to the basic story, which could have been very interesting. By the time I got into the story it was almost over.
0060589280|3.0|There were things I both liked and disliked about this story.  I liked Maria.  I enjoy reading about strong female characters, and I thought she was indeed strong.  She made a terrible mistake early on, but she refused to accept the results of this one choice as her fate.  She set a goal of getting out of her fallen lifestyle and she never gave up.  I also liked Ralf when he was introduced.  Ralf was a complex character who was heavily laden with emotional and sexual baggage, but he was searching for some sort of salvation from himself even though he may not have realized it until he found it.<br /><br />The story itself was hit-and-miss for me.  I enjoyed reading about Maria's personal journey, but I didn't really understand how the S&M sexual experience was so profound to her life.  I believe the point was that she is meant to find love within the context of a sexual relationship, or perhaps that she was meant to experience sex without the absense of love.  So why did this require S&M exactly?  It felt like it was there for token shock value to the reader, but frankly, it wasn't that shocking.  Most romance novels are more graphic than this without including bondage or domination.  It was more of a distraction to me than a contribution to the storyline.<br /><br />*************spoiler alert***************<br /><br />I liked the part at the end when Maria leaves Ralf's house and hopes that he will stop her from leaving.  She hopes he'll stop her at the airport and then she hopes he'll stop her on the plane.  It doesn't happen, but she keeps hoping for that perfect movie ending to her story.  She reflects about how life doesn't turn out like the movies, and how one never really knows if the characters live happily ever after when the movie ends.  This was such a simple concept, but it felt very real for me because I think that everyone hopes at one point or another that we'll get to experience our own version of a perfect movie ending sometime in our life.  She wanted and hoped for that moment even as she told herself that life wasn't really like that.  This felt very genuine and real.<br /><br />So was it real then that she got her movie ending after all?  I don't think so.  It wasn't even her own moment...when Ralf finally shows up, he quotes a line from Casablanca.  Her perfect movie ending was a copy of a moment experienced between two fictional characters in a movie, it wasn't really hers at all.  At the very least, it should have been something more original.<br /><br />**********end spoiler*************<br /><br />Overall this was only ok for me.  There was nothing really in the book that would make we want to either encourage or discourage a perspective reader.

0061438294|5.0|This book is written by an Ex-FBI Agent that is all about reading peoples nonverbal communications. He started a self-learning process as a child who did not speak english but became very perceptive of what people were saying with nonverbals. I have other books on this subject and while they are both interesting and informative, I really enjoy and recommend this book because it is very insightful and gives solid real life examples so you can better understand what he is telling you. Buy this book first, it will be the one you enjoy the most (very readable) and is relevant in real life.

B0045U9WPU|5.0|Lauren Oliver creates a world vastly different from ours where love is a disease. Everyone has a procedure after turning 18 to cure them of the disease which makes them feel no strong emotions like a lobotomy. Lena's procedure is coming up and she's excited until the world she thought she knew starts to come unraveled.    Oliver's language is beautiful and the story flows perfectly. I fell in love with this world and Lena. The story isn't all action, but it keeps your interest with the beautiful descriptions and glimpses of a very different world.    It reminds me of a cross between The Hunger Games and 1984. If you liked those books than this is for you.
1594202842|1.0|Listening to this audiobook was like listening to hours of nonstop nails on a chalkboard.  Chua comes across as big-headed, overly confident and obnoxious.  The constant comparisons between \\"Western\\" and \\"Chinese\\" parenting becomes monotonous quickly, and while she prefaces in the beginning that she isn't generalizing, she is.  It's clear.  And despite the fact I disagree with so many of her parenting ideas, it's her attitude that was the biggest turn-off of this book.  I can usually get through most parenting books, even if the ethos is different than my own, but this book was downright intolerable.
0767802519|4.0|This is a fantastic movie...The story of a loner of a hitman getting involved and caring for a hunted, unloved and surviving child of a murdered family.

0375704027|5.0|This Story is on one side a story of misadventure and a melancholic exploration of adolescent love and another side a thought-provoking and poignant study of memory, morality and mortality. Murakami never disappoints and always writes with a poetic richness that leaves almost every line hanging with symbolic possibility, loved it!   The main protagonist takes you back to the 1960s and his youthful goings on with his peers, his adventures are steamy so comes with adult warning! The story is set in thriving Tokyo and also shifts location to a relaxed mountainous retreat. You really get to love the characters that Murakami creates which I also felt with his other novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. To think that his works have been translated from Japanese into English and still hold a poetic and deeply thought-provoking quality is truly mesmerising stuff. It's by no means just a love story. This story is more about lived experiences, where his other novels have tones of supernatural and incorporated mind games. The book title if you are wondering is taken from a Beatles track 'Norwegian Wood' which is one of the novel's characters favourite songs.       There is a movie adapted from this book which is worth checking out, that was what gave me the incentive to read this book during April instead of 'Kafka on the Shore' of which i was more eager to read before this title. Thanks to the movie release prompting me, turned out was one excellent story of Love and Loss. Considering I used same procedure 'read the book watch the movie' with a few other novels and was disappointed with books like 'Let the right one in' 'Girl who played with fire' 'Never let me go' and 'Rosemary's baby' theres still hope for watching the movie adaptations of these titles, now I need to find time to watch these movies.

B004QYZATW|1.0|I honestly just watched this because I wanted to see Johney Depp all cleaned up and sexy looking. It seems like Angelina doesnt care about the quality of the story anymore...all she cares about are if the movie displays her Sexiness & she gets to play with guns and blow up things. Can you say BORING? Unless you are a guy who just wants to drool over Angelina dont bother with this C-grade film. I would tell you the plot but there was none..seriously.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is arguably one of the best horror films ever made. The performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence is both haunting and mesmerizing, and is one that I will never forget. A truly horrifying film, it focuses a lot more on mental images and illusions for it's horror, and can be slow at times, as opposed to the fast paced, popping out at you horror films that you see so often. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see great acting and cinematography at work, as Kubrick truly makes this film something to remember.
0393312836|4.0|When I first read the introduction from Burgess, I knew that this book was one that I have never come across before. To have the author of the book blast not only the director of the film adaptation, but also the publisher in New York in the first pages, I was already intrigued. Understanding the vision of an author and to have that altered can really be a shame.     Like most of the reviewers, I read the first page of the actual novel and I was very frustrated with the slang of \\"your most humble narrator\\". However, I found that after using the context clues as well as looking at some of the other reviews to get some insight on the book, it was quite easy to read. I found that having to reread the phrases helped me focus on reading the novel. Though it was a very grimm subject matter, I couldn't stop reading.     The question of justification on the government's part is still an active argument in today's society. Should one's morality be controlled by someone else if it means turning them 'good'? Everyone is going to have a different opinion on this and Burgess is great at the visuals of explaining the consequences of brainwashing even the worst criminals. I enjoyed reading the book and though the subject is gruesome, the avid reader should get a chance to viddy themselves to open their glazzies and rots to something new.

B00428ZRFE|4.0|I'm so happy that Rihanna wandered away from the strange direction she was taking with `Rated R' and filtered back into her comfort zone; flavored pop/R&B.  She really adds such beautiful color to this genre because she isn't afraid to embrace her background and bring something new and unique to the radio.  This is possibly her finest album, and at least her best effort since `Good Girl Gone Bad'.  There are a few bumps in the road, but overall this album is a great offering from a controversial yet beloved artist.<br /><br />So let's dissect this a little.<br /><br />`Only Girl (in the World)' was the album's first single, and initially I wasn't impressed.  She sounded like a Beyonce copycat to me, especially in the chorus, and I've always prided Rihanna in NOT sounding like she was trying to be the technically great yet ultimately boring Beyonce.  I like the song enough now, and it's never been a bad song just not `great'.  The song just lacks any real flavor.  It sounds like any pop-diva could have done this song.  `What's My Name' is, without doubt, the best single off the album so far.  The track is flawlessly exciting, and Drake's guest rap is intriguing and perfectly elevates the track.  It's a nice marriage between the two stars.  The beat is catchy, the lyrics are memorable and Rihanna sounds great.  `S&M', the latest single off the album, is a lot of brash fun, although it does tend to cross over into tacky territory at times.  The song is infectious, but it doesn't show off any maturity (although it is, um, mature).  I still can't help but sing along to it, so that's a plus.<br /><br />`California King Bed' is a nicely done ballad that strips Rihanna down and gives her a chance to show her vocal range without an overproduced musical arrangement.  I'm always iffy with Rihanna and her ballads because her vocal style is more suited to more aggressive and seductive tracks.  When she slows things down she has a tendency to show her vocal weaknesses, but this song really exposes no weakness.  Rihanna sounds impeccable here, pristine and sincere and she hits every note beautifully.  `Complicated' starts off with a bang, showcasing Rihanna hitting some of the highest notes I've ever heard her attempt, and she NAILS IT.  The track then takes that opening and runs with it, but in a beautifully subtle way that highlights softer and more intimate aspects of Rihanna's voice before it trips into a techno-savvy chorus structure that softens the intro vocals but maintains that feeling in your heart.  I mean, this is a perfect song.<br /><br />`Raining Men' features the new `it' girl Nicki Minaj, and I'm so happy about that.  I just love that chick.  This song is a blast.  It's a great mix of club standards and island flavor with a crazy awesome rap run by Miss Minaj; not to mention stellar vocals by Rihanna who runs the beat with her voice magically.  It's got camp aspects to it, but they are integrated effectively so as not to take anything away from the edgy quality the track flaunts.<br /><br />`Fading' starts off with in interesting musical riff that leads into a typically effective pop track that is elevated by Rihanna's vocal style and a catchy chorus that is supremely likable (here is Rihanna exposing her vocal cracks to perfection, showing vulnerability as opposed to a weakness).<br /><br />`Skin' is Rihanna's chance to seduce the listener, and she's partly successful.  The song has its strong points, but in the end it feels a bit cheap.  `Cheers (Drink to That)' is just strange.  I don't know why she is sampling Avril Lavigne here; it's a little odd, and her vocal downplay is a tad underwhelming (she can hit those low notes well, but sometimes she feels almost parody within them).  The song is just dull, which is sad because with some tweaking it could have been a knock-out.  `Man Down' is a disaster.  I don't like it when Rihanna tries to pretend that she is ghetto.  Listen Rihanna, we all know that you have edge, but when you pretend that you kill people or gang-bang you come across insincere and foolish.  I like the musical arrangement, because I'm all for Rihanna embracing her heritage, but the lyrical content and lackluster vocal delivery make this song the clear worst on the entire album.<br /><br />`Love the Way You Lie Pt. 2' closes out the album brilliantly.  The collaboration of Eminem and Rihanna is going to be remembered for a long while thanks to Eminem's brilliant `Love the Way You Lie', and while this second part could have easily felt like a cheap attempt to capitalize off of the original's popularity (I mean, it even sports the same musical arrangement), the song stands on its own and feels like a nice compliment.  The two songs fit together beautifully and work as great bookends to two different yet equally effective albums.<br /><br />For those of you interested; my rankings:<br /><br />1) Complicated<br />2) What's My Name<br />3) Love the Way You Lie pt. 2<br />4) Raining Men<br />5) California King Bed<br />6) Fading<br />7) S&M<br />8) Only Girl (in the World)<br />9) Skin<br />10) Cheers (Drink to That)<br />11) Man Downyou come across insincere and foolish.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I read the reviews on the MDR-7506 along with probably most Studio headphones.  The one thing that stood out most for me was the fact that the MDR-7506 has had more reviews than almost any other headphone bar none.  I was replacing a less than stellar pair of Senn HD201-s, but let's be realistic, for the price they are \\"ok\\".<br /><br />I got the MDR-7506's home and immediately unpacked them and connected them to my LiveWire AMP.  Comfort, well they fit my head perfectly well.  I wore them for 4 hours of continuous music.  Sound...... Stellar, excellent!  Rich Bass, the mids are outstanding, (an area the Senn's really lacked)and the highs are crisp and clean, every nuance is clear and precise.  I normally am not a fan of Sony products in general but I have to admit that even after the 300 plus reviews, I was still pleasantly surprised.  I DJ online, normally in 2 hour shifts and these cans will definitely make that a whole lot more fun.  I will update the Durability & Takes a beating categories in a few weeks.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend these.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been a Star Wars fan (like most of us here) for far too many years.  To me, it was a wonder why Lucas waited as long as he did to release this on Blu-Ray.  My guess is that he was thinking his own innovative technology might come up with a means by which he could slide it past Blu-Ray!  The fact is this medium is the best at this time.  Lucas was no doubt content and probably gave in, not for the money, but he felt his fan base deserved to see the movies the way they were meant to be seen.  Having seen TBS parade these versions recently should be incentive enough for the purchase (like any Star Wars fan has to even think about it!... OK, COSTCO may have it cheaper later this year...)... my thought is this.  I first saw Star Wars in a theatre when I was 18... I will never forget that day.  Ever!  This would not only be a necessary addition to any home theatre collection... but few movie collections have ever inspired this much feedback from such a diverse fan base. Thank you George Lucas!

B004R92PYE|5.0|I remember when Panic! Exploded on the scene and managed to separate itself from all of the other fallout boy clones. Their first album was a good listen. Pretty odd came out and showcased the band's experimental approach and was a hit or miss with some of their fans. After pretty odd came out i honestly thought the band fell off the face of the earth. I saw on Itunes that Vices and Virtues was released one day and decided to give the album a listen. I did not know what to think and i read reviews about how great the album is. I decided to get the album and wow! This band is back and better than ever. This is honestly their best album to date, it shows growth and diversity in the band. The chorus' for the album are very catchy and the album will replay in your head after you have listened to it. This was a great album and i highly recommend getting it!!!

B002ZG98G4|3.0|I suppose that's not the most diplomatic way for me to frame how I describe her go-getting morning show executive producer, but the person she is portraying can be, most certainly, scattered. She obsesses over her work (and what modern working woman in The City That Never Sleeps doesn't), she flits from idea to idea at a early afternoon first date dinner (whom she manages to scare off in mere minutes), and can't quite decide when to silence her meandering babbles in front of anyone, let alone her future boss (Jeff Goldblum), a ratings driven executive who may or may not be ready to take a chance on her.<br /><br />Still, McAdams plays the part of almost thirty-something Becky, who seeks to rebound from being replaced at her local Jersey affiliate morning show (by a pedigreed blueblood named Chad, no less) via a Hail Mary throw at the big leagues of New York City's (fictional) channel IBS early morning Daybreak, pretty darn well. Montage scenes have her throwing resumes to the wind, with follow up calls one on top of the other... but she gets her shot. And while Daybreak may be the worst rated morning show of the fold, she hits the ground running, finagling the distinguished Michael Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to co-anchor with show veteran Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton).<br /><br />Both Mike and Colleen are the quintessential prima donnas of their respective backgrounds; Mike the ever serious hardnews reporter in the vein of Brokaw, Rather and Cronkite and Colleen is morning show royalty, having held the chair for decades running fluff piece after fluff piece with the style and poise that won her the Ms. Arizona pageant lo those many years ago. Together they are fire and gunpowder agreeing only on the pride they have in how they view their respective careers.<br /><br />Added to the craziness is the apparently necessary love interest in Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson), a story editor for a 60 Minutes lookalike magazine show and the fated man with whom our fair Becky clicks with almost immediately only to waffle back and forth over throughout the entirety of the movie. To me, it was a tacked on romance that doesn't really seem to serve anything other than the message that you can't just have work to hold on to... especially late at night when the dark eats away at you. Still, Rachel looked fabulous in the designer lingerie she wore for him on their second date, but that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />*ahem*<br /><br />Morning Glory is filled with solid... and I mean ROCK SOLID actors in very believable roles that they fill entirely too well. Even Ty Burrell in his tiny, kinda pervy outgoing anchor role worked great. And don't get me started on Diane Keaton. Her arc from frustrated diva to gung-ho supporter even while keeping her nails sharp for raking against Ford's hide is delightful (though I could have done without her joining 50 Cent's posse for a late movie segment... but that's just the sort of ridiculous stunt morning shows tend to pull).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the feeling of the movie overall is as scattered as the main character. The main forces and conflicts between Becky and her hostage anchor Mike lack a believable rhythm. She ambushes him, he relents dragging his feet, he retaliates, and she counters. It's all very formula, but it's all very lacking. Little moments where there should be a connection almost seem to be there, but fall to the wayside as the story marches on in its far too brisk pace. Little seeds are sown early in the movie; Becky's mother is embarrassed for her, Mike cooks and lectures over a frittata, and it all screams \\"well THIS is climax material\\" and it is. And while the movie shouldn't suffer for it, and should actually revel in these little touches, I can't help but feel like they're afterthoughts.<br /><br />There is plenty of mild satire on the state of the News in modern America, but it just doesn't fit in the sort of \\"coming-in-to-her-own\\" feel good movie they tried to make here. It's likebits and pieces of Network, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and a Julia Roberts/Sandra Bullock movie were thrown into a blender and only the best bits of each one were served. Sure, it's the good stuff, but they don't gel together well.<br /><br />Now... I do want to say that director Roger Michell did a pretty good job. This is a decent bit of filmmaking he and JJ Abrams'  Bad Robot crew have made here, but it's not perfect. From the minute I saw that logo I expected excellence and what was presented came a little close, but not close enough.<br /><br />Still... I liked it better than Notting Hill. Three Stars.<br /><br />While I have a moment, I want to give a quick shout out to John Pankow (whom I haven't seen since Mad About You ended) as a great assistant producer to back up McAdams. Honestly, this guy has great acting chops and it's amazing I haven't seen him in anything since the 90's., and a Julia Roberts/Sandra Bullock movie were thrown into a blender and only the best bits of each one were served.

1400052181|4.0|It's fascinating to learn about the history of medical research and the steps that have been taken to discover the causes, treatments and cures for so many diseases.   It seems that patients were treated more with objective fascination rather than compassionate care.   I give Rebecca Skloot much credit for her tenacity and staying power in discovering exactly what happened to Henrietta and her family.Rebecca artfully weaved the truths, many of them extremely painful, into a factual and entertaining novel.
0670022411|5.0|This book started out really slow for me. It makes sense that it does because there are so many things that need to be introduced before the story can get rolling. Once I got passed all the introduction, I realized i was beginning to like the book more and more. The more I read it, the more i could not put it down! I was totally hooked by the ending and left positively praying for a sequel!

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I had not been all that impressed with some of the later FF releases, but this one is really a nice surprise-  It might actually be my favorite FF album.  It definitely is louder and faster (and therefore more awesome) than their other recent releases, and I for one think that Dave's dealings with QOTSA and Them Crooked Vultures have significantly influenced this album in a very positive way!  To me, the QOTSA influences are all over the place, but the album still maintains the FF \\"trademark\\" sound...  It had seemed like the recent FF releases just consisted of a couple made-for-radio songs, and a bunch of filler... almost as if the band was totally out of ideas.  But thankfully this album sounds inspired!  The \\"made for radio\\" stuff is still present to some degree, but it is much better than normal (See \\"Walk\\").  I did NOT expect a song like \\"White Limo,\\" but welcome it with open arms!  All, in all, I expected this to be another bad release from an aging 90s band, but it's AWESOME.
0525422943|5.0|Despite being generally aware of trendy YA books, I somehow missed \\"If I Stay\\" completely. I was at a reading with Gayle Forman a few weeks ago, where she read a passage from \\"Where She Went.\\" I liked what I heard, so I was encouraged to buy \\"If I Stay\\" in advance of the sequel's release. In addition to meeting Gayle, which was awesome, I was very pleased to find a great new read. I breezed through it, loving the writing style, voice, and unique way of handling the whole \\"being in a coma\\" situation. So, I bought \\"Where She Went\\" as soon as I could and, if possible, enjoyed it even more than \\"If I Stay.\\"    Gayle Forman did a great job of creating a new voice in Adam, and what, to me, seemed to be a believable male narrator. I was so happy to be able to jump into Mia and Adam's lives, and I enjoyed the flashbacks mixed in with the action going on that night. As the book went on, I realized that I truly cared about both characters, despite how they had treated each other and what mistakes each one had made. Even though I knew Mia so well after \\"If I Stay,\\" I still was able to feel for Adam and be angry with Mia, which I think shows great talent on the part of the author for being able to sway a reader's emotions so believably and completely (at least this reader's!). Gayle Forman also does one of my favorite things a writer can do: She pulls off writing colloquially while still being beautifully moving.      Without spoiling the ending, I think I cried even more in this one than the first. The love story here completely broke my heart, in a different way than losing Mia's family did in the first book. Instead of having people who would be forever separated, you had two people just inches away from each other who couldn't figure out how to come together.     Overall, this is a great sequel, so I highly recommend it if you've read \\"If I Stay.\\" If not, get these together and read them both!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Although this movie is a few years old, I only actually saw it for the first time recently. I fell in love with the movie immediately. It would be the best movie I have ever seen. Great work from Ang Lee. This movie is about forbidden love between two men. Ledger was fantastic as \\"Innes\\" and Gyllenhaal was fabulous as \\"Jack\\". It so touched my heart I felt like standing in the middle of the road with a big sign saying : \\"Watch Brokeback Mountain\\". Michelle Williams, who plays Innes's wife was truly great at her role. Anne Hatheway also made a great impact on me. It is a film with 4 fantastic actors, sad yet romantic. For those who are struggling with coming out as being \\"Gay\\", I do reccommend this movie. It demonstartes the consequences of not following your heart, but rather what society expects of you. If you find sad movies too much to handle, then avoid this because I needed a full box of tissues nearby. It is film that will stay in my heart for ever.  Rog - Australia
B00402FGEE|5.0|As a fan of the original Stargate movie, I was always skeptical of the shows.  When my wife and I heard that Robert Carlyle was in this show we thought we'd check it out just to see how it was.    We were not disappointed...the show is wonderful!  Awesome effects and very complex characters with a great story line.  If you have read the negative reviews about this show, ignore them.  As a long time Sci-Fi fan since 1974, this is the best show that I've ever seen.  (and I include Star Trek in that)  Definitely a must buy set!
0439023521|3.0|My opinion (SPOILER ALERT!!!):<br /><br />I liked it. I won't deny that, but it's some things about it that really bothered me. Like for starters, the first person present tense. Now, I want to become a YA novelist and most of the books I've read has been in first person, but first person past tense. I find it a bit awkward, don't you? I mean, I've never heard of anyone writing as they were walking. Well, of course Katniss wasn't writing, but it was in her POV. I don't know how to explain it, I just found it very strange that it was in present tense.<br /><br />Second, the description. She explained more about the food than the conversations. It was very unnecessary to me. Their conversations could have been unnecessary as well, but I would have rather heard that then sounding like I was reading a cookbook. The clothes explanations I understood and maybe I kind of understood about the food as well counting on the districts not really having anything good, but I just found it a little annoying is all.<br /><br />Third, when it FINALLY went to Hunger Games, it was alright. I've read reviews where people would say it was disturbing, but I found it not to be that in the least. There are way worst disturbing things than what went down in the Games. And how could it be? Katniss basically stayed away from all the killing. And the little twist at the end had my brows raising. It was really out of nowhere. I won't say what it was, but it was still like huh?<br /><br />Anyway, going back to Katniss and another character: Peeta. This guy, to me...I couldn't really get him, if you know what I mean. He seemed like...he was just...there. It feels like the author doesn't let his personality shine enough. He doesn't seem all that appealing at all. It's almost like he's just there just to be there. I can't really say I like Katniss all that much. She claimed she hated the Hunger Games, and who could blame her? However, she felt she had no choice (which she didn't) but to participate and smile. Smile? I know it was to get sponsors and such, but I wouldn't be able to smile and act out for the TV like in the next few days I wasn't going to be fending for my life. And then, to make matters worst, she was kissing Peeta and was very oblivious to his true feelings. It was in her POV and it was STILL obvious! The dude loved her, and she just kept saying it was all for TV. Really? Kind of stupid...<br /><br />Well, overall, everyone has their own taste, so I say give it a try. I liked it, like I said before. I just kind of wish it was more action and was a bit more disturbing, so it can leave me feeling like I want to read it again. Though, this book didn't leave that affect on me. I'll be reading the second book soon, so look for my um...opinion then.<br /><br />[...]Rockie[...]<br /><br />[...] This is where you can find the original review.

B004RF2KAC|2.0|I love Jennifer, and after the last album I has high hopes for the next one. It is real commercial and churchy, and doesn't show Jennifer for the woman she is or the woman she's becoming. Overall.....just Disappointed. But then again, maybe that was the aim. To be more commercial. The last album showed passion and sincerity, but this one lacked it and the material she's given for the album isn't really for her.
B00005JLIU|4.0|It wasn't bad, but I much prefer the play made a few years later. The songs are more fun, and the characters are more fun and likeable, esp. Muzzy, Trevor, Jimmy and Miss Dorothy. I didn't like Muzzy in this. And Julie Andrews is a wonderful performer, but I would have cast someone else. She just doesn't seem like the right Millie to me. Also, the songs, except for \\"Poor Butterfly\\" and \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" were not that great. I did like the Vaudville scene and where they take out Miss Meers and her lackeys. Still worth watching, but the broadway (Well I saw it at George Fox and it was AMAZING) version is much better.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|In my opinion, \\"Wasting Light\\" is by far the Foo Fighters' best album since \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose.\\" I loved the Foo Fighters' first three albums, particularly their first, which seemed to come out of nowhere following Cobain's suicide, and their third, which I think boasted their best set of songs. Since then, there have been songs I've liked, but the albums started to sounds \\"same-y,\\" with many well-played but, quite frankly, forgettable songs.<br /><br />That is not the case at all with \\"Wasting Light.\\" Though it has that instantly recognizable Foo Fighters sound, it's got big, arena-ready choruses and riffs, hard-hitting production (thanks to the great Butch Vig), and fully fleshed out songs. In other words, it's exactly the kind of album I want to hear from this band.<br /><br />As middle-age lurks around the corner for me, hard rock for hard rock's sake isn't something that attracts me as much as it did in my teens. I still like gripping, rocking songs, but I need something more - I need substance in the music I listen to, so I'm very happy that the Foos delivered the goods on this album.
1601251556|4.0|This mat is big, and cleans real easy. Just have to put books on it over night to make it flat.
B004BLJQOK|2.0|...and as such was prejudiced against this remake from the start, despite the fact that I think Matt Reeves is a stylish, capable filmmaker.<br /><br />There was so little purpose in this film - as was apparently evidenced by its low box office take - as to warrant it completely unnecessary. Sure, it's beautifully shot (except for some laughable 'vampire attacking' effects). Sure, it's got moody production design and satisfying gore. But guess what? So had the original, 'Let The Right One In.' Guess what else the original had? Storytelling. Horror. Tension. Pacing. Mystery. And questions unanswered, the best part of any filmic story whose roots are hidden in the shadows of culture.<br /><br />I didn't bother with the features on the DVD because I frankly didn't care. Why couldn't this have been an original vampire story, told with the same amount of care and skill by such extraordinarily talented actors as Richard Jenkins, Chloe Moretz and the spellbinding Kodi Smit-McPhee (I can't believe he's Australian!)? I realize I'm beating a dead horse here, but I can't resist giving it one more whack with my stick.

096501746X|3.0|Ray Bradbury is one of the best-known science fiction writers of two generations ago.  His distinctive soft-science style helped to offset science fiction's early flood of space operas and narrative physics homework problems.  By some definitions it isn't even science fiction, but by any standard it is good story-telling.  This collection of 28 stories is set on--or on the way to--Mars in the years 1999 to 2026.  These years are the unknown future for readers and the writer looking forward from the 1950s.<br /><br />Interesting snippets of this future Martian history from the past include:<br /><br />In \\"Rocket Summer\\" a departing expedition to Mars causes a sudden climate change.<br />In \\"The Summer Night\\" the poetry of Earth is heard on Mars for the first time.<br />\\"The Third Expedition\\" lands on Mars and is greeted by familiar faces.<br />Young boy explorers become \\"The Musicians\\" in an old Martian village.<br />\\"The Luggage Store\\" sees a surge in travel after news of a war on Earth.<br /><br />The science in these stories is old, but this matters less than usual in dated science fiction because they aren't really about the science.  Readers are left to decide whether the view of human beings from half a century ago may have become dated.  It is worth reading these stories to wrestle with that very question.

B0036EH3UC|5.0|I am Glad  that we did not know about the quality of this series until we could watch at our leisure on disk. I feel for those brave fans that had to wait out the writers strike and other delays that resulted in a torturous release of episodes in dribs and drabs.  This is a very rich story, beautifully performed and produced. As with most fiction, it is important to suspend disbelief. In the course of creating a world very similar (but not identical) to our own, you end up seeing a few things that might cause an eye roll, such as products of modern earth. And I never did get why they seem to cut corners in the making of all things book-like. But as we go back and listen to the extensive commentary, available for nearly every episode, I expect that we will learn their thinking.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Mr. Lucas, you've had your fans give you enough money over the years, yet you continue to deny us the originals we want. Here's a hint, quite toying with us. You clearly are aware of how much the fans want the originals, yet every year you keep shoving the \\"improved\\" version on us. I refuse to give my money up unless I know there will be the movies I want to see, not the ones you want us to see. Until I know that there is the unaltered versions, I will only cast my vote as 1 star.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|I am usually not one to purchase soundtracks. While I enjoy the movies they accompany, I am usually far more interested in the story to care about the music in the background. Sucker Punch is an enormous exception to this rule.<br /><br />I won't go track by track as other reviewers have done it to much better effect, but there is something just raw and bleeding about this soundtrack that compelled me to purchase it. It perfectly evokes each movement in the movie proper, and each song very clearly defines and is defined by the scene it accompanies. For example, Sweet Dreams just oozes hate and rage and frustration, a series of emotions that is only equaled by the events in the opening of the movie. White Rabbit is deliciously trippy, serving as the planted flag of the movie. It is Alice in Wonderland, the escape of a young woman placed in an intolerable situation, and only the mind-bending qualities of Wonderland can save her. And I've never been a huge fan of Bjork, but holy mother of god does she fit in this soundtrack.<br /><br />If you're looking for a soundtrack that you can listen to endlessly and find new meaning and appreciation, or want to bring the movie back with each and every track, definitely pick up the soundtrack.

I want a refund for false advertised product both on your product page and on the dvd cover... Why do you not send all dvds back to the vendor when they lie one the covers?
0670022411|1.0|I am just too shocked for words. All the reviews I read were so positive I was surprised that I was falling asleep while the \\"heroine\\" (like many others have mentioned)rows, and runs, and yoga and eats disgusting amounts of toast and tea... snore, yawn.    I have but one thing to add. I have never been so thankful for the library as when I quit mid book. Thank the literary Gods for public libraries and thank them for not spending a dime on this boring fest.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|The best album they've put out in 11 years.  Not a bad song and quite a few hard rocking songs.  White Limo is just insane and gets you pumped up.  Rope is one of my favorite singles they've ever released.  If you like Foo Fighters you need to pick this up.

0316069353|5.0|First, a warning - open this book at your own risk. I was reading it on the train and became so engrossed that I almost missed my stop.     Criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller returns for the fourth time following his debut in Michael Connelly's 2005 award winning novel \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\". As the story opens, Mickey is still working out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car, but due to the poor economy, his former paying clients don't have money, so they're using the public defender's office instead. Fortunately, the bad economy has also created the foreclosure crisis, \\"which is the only growth industry in the law business\\". As Mickey says, \\"The cases went for only four or five grand a pop but this was a quantity-over-quality period in my professional life . . . No doubt my kid could start planning on USC. Hell, she could start thinking about staying for a master's degree\\".    When Lisa Trammel, one of his foreclosure clients, is charged with murdering the banker who's trying to take her house away, Mickey goes back to doing what he does best. He tells his client, \\"Whether you're innocent or not has nothing to do with this equation. It's what we can prove or disprove in court\\". As a former crime reporter, Connelly knows all the moves. Mickey uses every trick in the book and the prosecutor uses some of her own as each of them dances around the facts to try to come out on top. The writing is riveting and the twists and turns keep coming right up to the end.    Highly recommended. Just don't read it on a train or you may miss your stop.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|...this album is too beautiful. Restored my faith in our fellow primates. Brand renewal at its finest. Revitalizing, rejuvenating, makes me want to go out and steal a leopard. Or just borrow one for a wild, crazy Duran Duran party.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|This is clearly in the same league with Graceland and The Rythum of The Saints.  So Beautiful or So What, shows that Paul Simon has not lost his touch for stinging commentaries and listening to the title song, some of those lines are REAL daggers! Every song is wonderful and it kicks of  with Getting Ready for Christmas Day, which is a strong song, with a strong and unusual arrangement, setting the same tone that was set when begining Graceland with Boy In The Bubble.     The Afterlife is a classic! The opening lines are enough to make no num and only Paul Simon can pull off something along this line and make is plausable, and yet cerebral, which is one of the reasons he gets away with saying some of the things he's been saying, starting with Graceland, which was, on many levels, more openly \\"in your face\\".  This one, however, is more subtle, but fingers are being pointed and this time, they're not at South Africa! All of the songs are fine, but my favorites are the title song, The Afterlife, Rewrite, Questions for the Angels (what a great line about buying love at a bargin store, and the way it fits in with the remainder of the verse and the song as a whole), Love Is Eternal Sacret Light (sheer brilliance, and made me think of the old and wonderful \\"Gone At Last\\", on which he and Phoboe Snow brought down the house on his initial solo grammy winner for Album of the year: Still Crazy After All These Years).     This could be grammy number four for Album of the year for Simon, pushing him out of the three-way tie with Stevie Wonder and Frank Sinatra. HIs only competition thus far, also released April 12th is the new Alison Krause And Union Station CD Paper Airplanes, which is their first in about six years.  Both are WELL worth the wait. Run don't walk to get it.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I just recently completed the 2011 LA Marathon, my first...4:38:23.  I had updated my Garmin 405CX sotfware through the Garmin web page about a month before the race.  The updates are always recommended by Garmin to fix some problem with the watch, what I now realize is that the updates are used to fix some problem with the previous Garmin update.....On my training runs I began to notice an eratic battery charge level after the update...the Garmin would give me a low battery level signal after charging all night.  Then shut off, when I would go to charge it again it would say \\"fully charged\\".  I contacted Garmin tech support and they said to reset the watch and recharge it......I did, same problem, then back and forth with Garmin for the next three weeks, no solution......two days before my big race Garmin says send it back and they will repair or send me a refurbished one..........to make a long story short, half way through the marathon the stinking Garmin says \\"low charge\\" then shuts down....when I got back home I plugged it in to charge...the Garmin says \\"fully charged\\"  I felt like Garmin let me down big time....next Marathon I use a different brand.  Keep looking for a different brand of GPS watch.
1569242739|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I felt I had to.  I purchased this book by title alone - yes, I do judge books by their cover.  I love baking and especially baking cakes.  I have now made quite a few of these cupcakes and everytime they have turned out amazing!  I've had to start dropping off cupcakes so that I didn't end up eating them all.   My friends LOVE me for dropping these cupcakes off and beg me to make them. I'm not vegan but I find these cakes taste nicer then \\"non-vegan\\" ones!  My favourites - original chocolate, carrot cake (divine) and the gingerbread cupcakes.     I have purchased this book for other baking friends - who love cooking from it too.  We do share cupcakes!  The hardest part has been tracking down vegan ingredients in Australia but so far, so good!    If you are thinking about this book - stop thinking and just buy!  It's awesome!
0060566108|4.0|Every corporation must have future goals in mind, stating either where they want the company to be in the future or certain task they seek to accomplish. People are told throughout their life to set goals that they wish to achieve, in order to better themselves. Majority of the time we are told to set reasonable goals, however in Built to Last Mr. Jim Collins and Mr. Jerry I. Porras shows us that visionary companies that set what they call Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs) are the most successful. They define Big Hairy Audacious Goals as clear and compelling goal that engages their employees. In the eighteen cases preformed throughout the book in fourteen of them the visionary company displayed BHAGs where the comparison company didn't. These audacious goals majority of them started at the beginning of the company with claims to become the leader of their respective industry. For a startup company this is a very bold and clear goal, it engages the employees and lets them know where the company is striving to be. This is tangible as well, it can be easily measured. General Electric's BHAG, stated \\"To become number one or number two in every market we serve and revolutionize this company to have the speed and agility of a small enterprise.\\" Employees at GE were stimulated by this statement and strived to achieve this which pushed the company to become the dominant corporation it is today.  Another key aspect of BHAGs, is that if the BHAG is accomplished it is up to management to create a new one that will continue to stimulate progress. We are shown examples where companies achieve their goals that they have set and then become complacent and competitors are able to pass them by. Ford is one example of this, when Henry Ford stated his BHAG for Ford a car in every working man's garage.  After the invention of the assembly line and driving down production cost Ford realized Mr. Ford's dream, but then didn't set a new goal for continuing success in the future. GeneralMotors was then able to surpass Ford and take over the automobile industry, until Ford woke up again. Keeping the employees of a company motivated is key ingredient in making a visionary company.    Mr. Collins and Mr. Porras also notice a characteristic of visionary companies of how their employees are all very happy and most are proud to work for their respective companies. They notice the trend that satisfied employees are an important key to having a visionary company. It is not that visionary companies are the best companies for anyone; it is just that they do a very good job of weeding out the employees that do not fit in with the core values of the company. The visionary companies do this by selecting young employees (typically recent graduates) that they can mold into the type of employee that demonstrates the company's core values. They mold employees by starting them at the bottom of the company and having them work their way up by meeting certain goals or sales. They keep encouraging their employees to reach these goals with positive reinforcement, such as pictures on the wall, and discount or pay incentives. Companies will also encourage employee to attend after work functions to get the feeling of family atmosphere throughout their corporation. They also encourage the spread of positive stories that employees have performed in order to benefit the customer or to reach certain goals. All these types of activities and awards bring employees together so they strive to work harder but more importantly make the employees that are not reaching these goals or buying into the core values of the company feel a little bit like an outcast; which normally leads to them leaving the company. Some of the visionary company's employees are so closely knit that in the book Built to Last they refer to them as cult-like cultures. When they say cult-like cultures it is no in a derogatory term, but that they have a clear understanding of who they are, what they are about, and what the company is trying to achieve.    This type of atmosphere amongst employees also inspires innovations, with the employees feeling of a family and being part of something bigger they are always looking for ways to better the company. This leads to employees either trying new strategies or creating new products and presenting them to the company in order to better the corporation. Management in the visionary companies have noticed this, and have established programs to allow the discovery of new products to flourish. One quote from a former CEO of 3M Corporation Mr. Richard P. Carlton \\"Our Company has, indeed, stumbled onto some of its new products. But never forget that you can only stumble if you're moving.\\" Throughout the book we notice numerous famous products that we use every day were invented as accidents, such as baby powder, band- aids, and credit cards. Some visionary companies even have a policy throughout their work day that employees must work on the development of new products for a certain amount of time a day. The company understands that every experiment is not going to lead to a successful product, but that they cannot move into the future unless they are attempting to better themselves for their consumers. The authors describe this process as an analogy to a tree with branches, always building new branches with innovations and keeping the ones that work and building upon them, and cutting off the branches that didn't work, until you have a healthy tree.    Another important strategy that visionary companies use pertaining to their employees is in house promotion. Through key examples they show the importance of promotion from within, and the importance of having management training programs always throughout the corporation. Visionary companies are always mentoring potential future managers and executive's officers, this way there is never a lull in management. Another reason for this is to make sure the successor is familiar with the company values and adheres to them. Through examples we have seen in some of the comparison companies, outside CEO's can come in and change the company core values which is confusing not only to their customers but to their employees as well. Promotion from within also helps the employees buy into the company, striving to better the company because they are under the impression that one day they can benefit from their attributes to the company. It is an incentive to work harder and get noticed; since management made the jump from stockroom employee to upper management, any employee can do the same.   The importance of \\"growing\\" a future CEO from inside the company is well addressed in chapter \\"Home Grown Management.\\"  In the authors' opinion a great achievement of any visionary company is that they employ the management-succession process, which enables them to secure their normal flow of operations in case something unpredictable happens and current management and the CEO can no longer manage the company.  We could agree that the management succession process is crucial to any company. The authors of the book prove their point by presenting very clear examples of the companies who did and did not use the management-succession strategy.    GE is presented as a company which followed a management-succession process. The company designed its own procedure to select a CEO out of internal candidates who had the best knowledge of the company's business and internal operations.  The authors believe that the prominent attention to leadership continuity in GE was one of the major contributing factors to making it a visionary company.   Westinghouse, in contrast to GE is presented in the book as a company that has been \\"rocked by periods of turmoil and discontinuity at the top.\\" (Collins, J., Porras J.).  The authors prove their point that Westinghouse paid significantly less attention to management development by referencing the fact that they tried to look for outside publications covering the internal succession process at Westinghouse, but were not able to find any substantial information.  Major discontinuities in management, among other factors undermined Westinghouse's prospects of becoming a visionary company.    The authors also try to bring readers' attention to the idea that \\"top management does matter\\" in ensuring successful operations of any company.   The authors view on the top management's role is clearly presented in a following statement - \\"Top management will have an impact on an organization - in most cases, a significant impact. The question is, will it have the right kind of impact?\\" (Collins, J., Porras J.).  The authors link the importance of top management's impact on an organization to a chosen strategy of \\"developing, promoting and carefully selecting managerial talent, grown from inside the company\\" in visionary companies. Comparison companies, on the other hand, neglect the concept of managerial impact which can be seen in a lack of continuity of quality leadership in those companies. The authors of the book clearly demonstrate that both the visionary companies and the comparison companies have had excellent top management at certain points in their histories. But the visionary companies have had better management development and succession planning (Collins, J., Porras J.).     An important concept of \\"discontent environment\\" in visionary companies that drives them to continue to develop is addressed in chapter 9 - \\"Good enough never is\\". The authors introduce a new distinctive quality of a visionary company - discontent. The research that the authors conducted supports the concept of continuous improvement, which developed in an institutionalized habit in visionary companies. A visionary company may not be a comfortable place to be in, and, as surprising as it may be, this is one of the major factors that makes a company visionary.  The authors stress the idea that comfort is not the objective in a visionarycompany. In contrast, visionary companies install powerful mechanisms to create discomfort in order to obliterate complacency and thereby stimulate change and improvement before the external world demands it (Collins, J., Porras J.).   The authors did a lot of research to demonstrate the readers how \\"the concept of discontent\\" can benefit a company.  P&G is presented in the book as one of the visionary companies that realized early enough that any rise to prominence may cause the company to become \\"complacent, happy and fat.\\" During the company's most successful years P&G had to develop a new radical marketing strategy that would allow P&G brands to compete with each other directly.  Since the marketplace did not provide enough competition, P&G created its own system of competition just to keep the company strong.    By following clear examples presented in the book, we can completely agree with the authors' point of view that, continuous discontent stimulates further development and makes a company strive to do better tomorrow than it does today.  The authors of the book stress the importance of building for the future and doing well today.  A distinctive management tactics used in visionary companies is that they do not accept the proposition that they must choose between short-term performance or long-term success. They build foremost for the long term while simultaneously holding themselves to highly demanding short-term standards (Collins, J., Porras J.).  The authors came to a conclusion, backed by a substantial evidence, that the visionary companies invested for the future to a greater degree than the comparison companies.   In their message to CEOs, managers, and entrepreneurs, the authors of the book urge the top managers to create \\"mechanisms of discomfort\\", invest in the future and innovate new methods and technologies before the rest of the industry, continue building for the long-term even in difficult times and make sure employees understand that comfort is not the objective (Collins, J., Porras J.).  The authors of the book have their own view on companies' \\"vision statements\\" as well.  Collins and Porras believe that the essence of a visionary company comes in the translation of its core ideology and its own unique drive for progress into very fabric of the organization - into goals, strategies, tactics, policies, processes, cultural practices, management behaviors, building layouts, pay systems, accounting systems, job design - into everything that the company does (Collins, J., Porras J.).  The authors conclude their message with reminding readers of the four key concepts to a successful management:  1. Being a clock builder - an architect - not a time teller;  2. Embracing the \\"Genius of the AND\\";  3. Preserving the Core and stimulating progress;  4. Seeking consistent alignment
B000PKX2KA|5.0|While I haven't used this unit for long, it has operated flawlessly in the time I have had it.  Even indoors (within 15 feet of a large window) I get 8 to 10 satellites.  The unit is small, compact, magnetically mounted and perfect for use with a laptop.  the cord is a tad short for some larger vehicle, but a USB extension cord solves this problem.    I purchased this unit as it has good Linux support (my intended platform) though all testing was done under Windows 7 on a netbook.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Nic Cage = bad hair, bad accent, worse acting - still a great fun flick. - Amber Heard absolutely dashing.  I can't say I remember seeing any of her actress skills, but then again I wasn't looking at those.  Nic busts out of hell, to save his only granddaughter!  While Amber busts out of Stuckeys to find a new life, she teams up with sly ol'Nic across the South chasing down Satan worshipers and their own evils.  Few bottles of booze, thousands of random bullets, and some finely placed hand saws/pitchforks this movie is fun and laughable.  Don't expect any awards - but do expect a nice 90 minutes of fun from good ol'Nic.
1597801585|3.0|This book springs into...Action? The Plot? Character? No, not really any of those.<br /><br />This is a hard book to figure.<br /><br />On the surface it seems to have it all: Distinct characters all working towards their own ends, sometimes in conflict, sometimes in harmony. You don't know what will happen as a reader, only that something big is coming. The world is unique and plays with some of the big topics of the day.<br /><br />The Windup Girl takes place in a dystopic future Thailand, where the world is beset upon by plague and famine--a result of massive corporate greed and folly. The oceans have risen and many of the world's greatest cities are under water. Petroleum fuels are scarce and alternative energy abounds. The fruits and mistakes of genetic manipulations are everywhere. It is a difficult place to live for those not at the top.<br /><br />In fact a lot of the book is spent explaining all of this and I think if anything, the book's focus is on setting. The ideas and the technology of the day are paramount. While it makes for a very real world--authentic to the Eastern culture of its location--it doesn't necessarily make for an entertaining read. I'm sure some purists might call me something akin to illiterate for not finding it incredibly engaging, but I am not one that lives solely for the idea of a story. I want characters to rule, and that's me.<br /><br />Who is the main character and protagonist? Is it Emiko? Or perhaps Anderson? Hock Seng? Jaidee? Kanya? Who? And who is the main antagonist? I honestly have trouble deciding.<br /><br />If the most sympathetic points to a main character, then you'd go with Emiko or Hock Seng, until half-way through when Hock Seng loses his pity edge and Emiko takes over...until she realizes her potential and well, no more pity.<br /><br />In a recent blog post ([...]) I pointed out one difficulty of the novel for me was the use of foreign terms. I love a book that strives for an authentic feel, but it is a fine line to walk between imbuing the flavor of another culture or time or language and overkill--where the book pushes the reader away with its unfamiliarity. And, at least with language, I think Bacigalupi stepped over that line, for me.<br /><br />With setting as key, I think the plotting also suffers. A good story is more than just a reporting of a series of events. While there is structure here and each character is rife with their own agenda, it never becomes something special.<br /><br />I want to be entertained, sucked into the story and mesmerized by the plight of its characters. The Windup Girl did not do that for me. I think of it along the lines of this: In real life, every event does not necessarily happen for a reason or affect you in a profound way. However in a book, I think it should.<br /><br />Kanya may have been the hidden heart of this novel, torn in multiple directions by the circumstances that shaped her young life, but the focus didn't fall on her until halfway through. Her mentor overshadowed her and his potentially great story ended far too soon.<br /><br />I'll say one thing for sure: Bacigalupi fooled me and did so consistently. I was never able to figure out for sure what would happen next, but neither was I profoundly moved each time as I was by the esteemed George R.R. Martin.<br /><br />Though it may not have compelled me, it was interesting in its own way: well done. For that I give it three kink-spring powered stars.

B004M17ITO|4.0|According to some people the only Queen albums you need are Greatest hits volumes 1, 2 and 3!! If there was ever proof that's not true it's this album \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" which is album number 3 from Queen and the one that brought them mainstream popularity in both the UK and US. Now along with a few other Queen albums it's been remasterded and reissued. Mainly because Queens long 40 year association came to an end with record company EMI and they are now with Universal Music and to celebrate their 40 years Annivarsary comes a batch of remasters.     The album of course begins with the brilliant \\"Brighton Rock\\" which at over 5 minutes(often would last over 10 minutes when played live) and featues Brian May's long guitar interlude. \\"Killer Queen\\" is one of the best songs Queen have ever written and features that now familar sound that tells you it's Queen!! \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" has a fast tempo and even has been called a speed metal track, it's been famously played live by Metallica. \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" , \\"Now I'm Here\\" and \\"In The Lap Of The Gods...revisited\\" are three great tracks that sum up this great album that there is no real weak tracks here. The rhythm section of John Deacon and Roger Taylor are real tight and just as important as Brian May and Freddie Mercury.     In many ways a lot of people missed this album as not soon after they released \\"A Night At The Opera\\" so it's great to be able to revist this gem of an album. For us people who already own the album their is the top notch remastering job that really improves on the original recording as well as any past reissues and gives Queen the treatment they deserve, and a second disc of bonus material to make us buy it again. Ther bonus disc mainly consists of live tracks such as \\"In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited\\" from Wembley in 1986 and \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" and \\"Tenement Funster\\" which are both taken from BBC sessions that Queen did in October 1974. The highlight of the live tracks is a version of \\"NowI'm Here\\" recorded Live at Hammersmith Odeon.     If you are a Queen fan who only has the greatest hits now is the perfect time to discover some of their many other gems. So do yourself and pick yourself up a copy of this classic album and some of the other early Queen albums that have been remastered.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Temple Grandin for sharing your life with us. Thank you Claire Daines and HBO for making such a heartfelt, amazing movie. I now own a copy and will be sharing it with everyone that shows the slightest interest in learning about Autism.....    Different is not Less....
B000YJ54DU|1.0|To quote PrakThomas' 1-star review: \\"In summary, No Hook, Bland Bad Guys, an 8 ft. roller coaster, politically polluted, unmemorable, and technically inaccurate. Worst Reacher book of all times. I think I'll wait for the paperback when \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" comes out.\\"    That about sums up this book after reading his previous efforts. If Child wants to switch up his formula and surprise us, how about getting Reacher into a relationship a woman where he--surprise--doesn't bed her, and I can't predict which woman will be his latest conquest. His treatment of Vaughan, the small town cop in Hope, came across as self-serving (his balls) and exploitive of her, conflicted as she was about her loyalty to her husband, a brain-injured, permanently hospitalized husband.     The scenes where the citizens of Despair pursue Reacher and Vaughan like some B-grade movie zombies were laughably formulaic. The anti-war, right-wing conspiracy, anti-Alaska Airlines--Child/Reacher is offended by the Bible verse on the airline's snack trays--points of view came across, as JOHN ONEIL puts it in his 1-star review, \\"Reacher's detour into politics and criticism of the war did seem out of character but not because I had any assumptions about his politics. He always struck me as outside of politics - outside of almost everything for that matter.\\"     His editors should have shelved this abysmal effort and made us wait for a more credible one. That would have been a small price to pay. As another reviewer put it, \\"'Nothing to Lose' except time wasted reading this one.\\" 1-STAR FOR SURE.
B002NPCSJG|5.0|Scalzi rules!  Great aliens, sage military leaders, scrappy human race, colonization of the galaxy.  Elements of Heinlein in here too.  And weirdly, a very human love story that is not stupid.  Ranks just under\\"Ender's Game\\" in my book as best SF book of all time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book the moment I picked it up. It's a pretty easy read, geared for young adults, but that just helps it to flow better. I love the plot and the story is so compelling that I got annoyed every time I was interrupted. Highly recommended :)
B00466HM28|4.0|I just forayed into the world of midi music. Making music was my main aim and using the computer keyboard was getting frustrating for the creative process. For any song writer, a midi control is an invaluable tool. So I wanted a midi keyboard that wouldn't break the bank while giving me the control I want. I found a new one on amazon for $67, which was a steal given the current price point.<br /><br />---------WHAT I LIKE-----------<br /><br />1) 8 Pad buttons with 2 banks (8 X 2 = 16 notes)<br /><br />2) Small form factor. This is one of the few keyboards that I can pop into my bag. Makes a great travel companion.<br /><br />3) Built in Arpeggiator. You can chose to sync to the global tempo or tap your own tempo using the 'Tap Tempo' button. You can chose repetition intervals of 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 and have triplets in each one. You can also change pattern of arrpegiation.<br /><br />4) Octave up and down buttons. Although you can only control two octaves at a time because it has 25 keys, you can use these buttons to give you a full range.<br /><br />5) Program mode: So this button can help you choose between 4 programs. So I can assign the same knob to different parameters depending on the program I am in. For example, I usually reserve Program 1 to the master mixer. And Program 2-4 to the VST's or Plugins I use. So in a sense they give you 8X4=32 knobs. But you can control 8 at a given time.<br /><br />6) Sustain button: gives expression when playing keys like Piano or a Fender Rhodes.<br /><br />7) So the program comes with an editor where you can edit all your presets. In this I like the transpose function a lot. I am used to playing the C scale as compared to any other scale. So depending on the song that I am composing, I transpose everything down or up so that C is my base note.<br /><br />8) Lit buttons and pads: Adds to function and oomph factor.<br /><br />-----------WHAT I DON'T LIKE----------<br /><br />1) My biggest gripe is the sensitivity of buttons. A lot of people have complained that the pads are extremely insensitive. And they couldn't be more right. The pads have to be tapped pretty hard for them to even register. You get used to it eventually but because of that your velocity range is pretty small. My friend has a M-Audio trigger finger, and the pads in that are so responsive, values 1 through 127. My pads only register certain values. Hopefully this is a software issue and Akai can fix it through a firmware update or something. If velocity responsiveness is important to you, readily discard this as an option. Go for the LPD8.<br /><br />Same goes with the keys, they aren't really responsive. This is exemplified when you are playing acoustic instruments where you want a tight control on velocity like piano.<br /><br />2) Lack of a mod wheel: I do know that this is a small budget keyboard an all, but the option of having a mod wheel would be a solid addition for future models. It adds so much expression in many instruments.<br /><br />3) Lack of a sustain input: Same as above, would be a solid addition for future models. Some people are complaining that the sustain button needs to be held down and cannot be locked. I mean the sustain button was to make up for the lack of an input. Why the hell would you complain that you need to press it down! If anything, you can add sustain as an effect in your DAW if you want it for a whole section.<br /><br />4) Only 4 presets. The nano key comes with 200 presets which allows you to control so many more parameters.<br /><br />----------ALTERNATIVES--------<br /><br />I think this unit has no real competition (offering same features) as of the moment in its price range. The Korg Nanokey: As good a device as it is, it has transport controls, knobs and sliders; missing out on the all important piano keys. The M-Audio Oxygen 25 is excellent too, but is $30 more. If the piano keys are all you need, the the Alesis Q49 is a solid keyboard giving you a fuller range, and ithas a modwheel and pitch bend too. The Alesis Q25 is great too. M-Audio E-Keys 37 is useless lacking the octave change option and it isn't even touch sensitive.<br /><br />Consider: I use Fl Studio 10 and it doesn't have a preset for the MPK mini yet. And this is not the case with Oxygen 25. So if you need the perfect out of the box experience and if you are using FL studio, then consider the latter. At the same time I would say that mapping out keys in FL Studio is a hassle free experience and can be done with MPK manually fairly easily.<br /><br />-----------FINAL SAY:----------<br /><br />Excellent beginner keyboard. For the price range, the features can only be a surplus. It seems like it is well constructed, and has the backing of an industry stable by carrying the name Akai. Some people seem to speak the opposite, but in my 1 month experience with the product it seems extremely well built. Looks and sounds like the first time I opened it.<br /><br />This device does have a few flaws. But if you were expecting a more refined product, why not stretch your budget? If dynamics on keys or pads are very important to you, DON'T BUY IT!!! I don't mean to sound like an apologist for this product, but I don't want the naysayers to deter the intentions of the average buyer like me who would benefit SO MUCH from a product like this. With hope for a better world, signing off for now.

They are brilliantly written, funny, insightful and inspiring. In fact, I miss them! (They haven't been published in the last few issues.)

0882709194|5.0|Anyone who writes such things as \\"Christian propaganda\\" or \\"Lies for Jesus\\" and other things of the like are clearly cowards who are afraid to face any idea that would dare to defy there own.  Apparently, instead of being able to give proper criticism of the book they would rather demean Christianity.      As for what I have to say of the book is that it is worth a read.  Look and examine and do not be afraid to ask the difficult questions.  In an age where you dare to claim there is knowledge become truly knowledged.

B004KPLVW2|4.0|I've loved this movie ever since I was a kid. For the time, the effects were amazing. And for the most part, they hold up pretty well today. The only bad thing about this new set of the movie is that there is a tad too much DNR. At least it's not as bad as the worthless Predator blu-ray that just came out. Another bad thing is that it has the movie in 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio. Which didn't exist when the movie came out. TRON is only supposed to be 4.0. Don't know why they messed it up.

B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn radio is an excellent app. For some esoteric reason, our local AM and FM stations are practically unintelligible - this application has given us a clear and reliable alternative to constantly looking for the right configuration of dial position, antenna placement, and mojo.<br /><br />TuneIn has a variety of useful features including a timer, alarm, presets, and a surprisingly good search function. I especially like how the search will group talk shows by how much time is remaining. It's nice to be able to catch that talk radio program at the beginning!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|The SB400 is a great budget flash and certainly has its limits, but for much less than the SB600 it does the job.  And, you can get much better pictures with it than with the on-camera flash.  The ability to change the angle vertically is great, and it would be even better if the head could turn +/- 60-degrees side-to-side, too.  It's a solid flash for most occasions and for the wallet.
0670022411|5.0|Like several other reviewers, I'm glad I finished the book before reading other reviews.  I bought it because of the good reviews it received in several magazines and newspapers.  I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed the story.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.  I will definitely buy the next book.  I want to know where the story goes.  Perhaps the book is best enjoyed by taking it for what it is - an enjoyable fantasy that keeps the reader engaged.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sicko helped me compare the US health care options with those of other countries.  Although Mr. Moore doesn't cover every system in all the developed nations, he covers enough to create concern about what the media here does and does not report as well as address the common fears about change. There is so much negative information about \\"Obamacare\\", and this documentary helps dispel some of the misconceptions about changing our system.  I would love to see additional information about health care in other countries.

Even if you don't know aperature from a hole in the ground, the author explains it in terms that ANYONE... I mean ANYONE could understand.

If you are already dabbling in photography but are having problems reaching perfect exposure, BUY THIS BOOK NOW!
B0036S4C6G|2.0|I read the Critics award for this book and bought the Kindle edition for $12.99.  I found the book confusing and boring.  Moreover, on the Kindle version (currently selling at a lower price), one section was difficult to read, as it was formatted as a \\"Powerpoint slide\\"  presentation with diagrams that are very hard to decipher.  I agree the author is quite creative in his approach and time-skipping sequences, but I prefer a good story with cohesive plot and interesting characters.

B004O4K4SQ|2.0|I like simple shooters but somehow the game design lacks surprises and gets fairly quickly repetitive. The graphics as shown in the screenshot glow brightly and are interesting, but for me too they loose their interest after playing for a while. Perhaps a competitive edge with online multiplayer modus would make me pick up the game again.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|This is a very enjoyable diversion, if not taken seriously, and (apparently) if one hasn't read the novels. It is a wacky amalgam of many medieval legends like Robin Hood, Merlin, The Green Knight, Der Ring Das Nibelungen (think of the sword between Siegfried and Brunnhilde as an analog to the Seeker becoming \\"confessed\\" if he realizes his passion for Kahlan), and bunch of old Tyrone Power movies.  The unadulterated hamminess of Bruce Spence as the Wizard \\"Zedd\\" is a delight, and Craig Parker (The Two Tower's Haldir) as Darken Rahl is campily villainous. Although Kahlan is a beauty, Tabrett Bethell as Cara is the sexiest lady on set. Craig Horner as Richard Cypher, the Seeker, is likeable, but slightly miscast.  The endearing trait of these logically absurd tales is how nicely they make sense as they are spun out. Some magical rule or inventive twist pulls us away from the precipice of disbelief and makes the impossible resolution almost reasonable. There might be a small logical dilemma in having the four major characters roving the forest on foot for days on end with only what they can carry in their pockets, but hey, maybe that's why he's the seeker.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed, and yes it was out loud. She's a comedy writer for real, and it shows. It wasn't overbearing, it had just the right touch ... not too much, not too fast, but boom! There would be the line that caught me off guard and tickled me. No, of course it's not Aristotle or Dostoevksy, but you know what, having studied Shakespeare and Dickens, she is similarly our culture's looking glass into what is so whacky about us. I loved it, don't miss this one. Or maybe you have to be a girl.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase.  The product arrived when it was schedule and was in fantastic condition.  I would strongly recommend purchasing more products from this site.
B000065Q88|5.0|Fabulous and I would argue better than the \\"Legend\\" album with the caveat that this record has the original \\"Redemption Song\\" version (with The Wailers) and not the more popular and familiar version with Marley alone........ With that exception this is a fantastic compilation...
B0011FTQ4O|5.0|I had the theatrical release on DVD and had never seen the extended version before buying this on blu-ray, but it's sooo much better than the theater version.  You can read other reviews for the details, just chalk me up as happy I bought it.

B0040JHWKS|5.0|As any Springsteen fan knows, this CD consists of 22 tracks that Bruce did not include on Darkness On The Edge Of Town because they didn't fit the mood that he was trying to create. He was right that most of these would be out of place there, but what he might have considered was releasing a two or even three record set back in 1978...with each one reflecting a different theme or mood. Of course one disk would be called 'Darkness', another disk could have been called 'Brightness' or something to that effect, and it would have consisted of the more upbeat positive songs such as \\"Ain't Good Enough For You\\" which is a good old fashioned party song that probably could have been a hit for Southside Johnny if Bruce had given it to him. It even name drops Jimmy Iovine. \\"Talk To Me\\" would have been another standout cut on the 'Brightness' disk...which ended up being a hit for Southside. Same goes for \\"It's A Shame\\". The soulful \\"One Way Street\\" with two gorgeous sax solos from Clarence Clemons would have also been a nice fit.    Bruce could have been extra ambitious by including a third LP consisting of 'Love' songs. Springsteen is not known for his love songs, but he did have a slew of them in the can...the obvious ones being \\"Because The Night\\" and \\"Fire\\" which is a much different version than the one released by the Pointer Sisters. Bruce's performance is much closer to how Elvis Presley might have recorded it if he had the opportunity. Other candidates for the 'Love' disc would have been \\"Someday (We'll Be Together)\\", \\"The Brokenhearted\\" (which sounds a bit like Roy Orbison), \\"Spanish Eyes\\" and \\"Save My Love\\". There are also a couple of Phil Spector influenced track to complete the 'Love' collection in \\"The Little Things My Baby Does\\" and \\"Gotta Get The Feeling\\".    \\"Breakaway\\" and \\"The Promise\\" would have sounded perfect on the original Darkness album, but I'm sure Springsteen would not want to have compromised the quality of the audio by including the extra grooves that would have been necessary.     The Promise is an amazing release of rejections. Every song but two (\\"Outside Looking In\\" and \\"Rendezvous\\") made my iPod. I still give it a perfect five stars due to the very high quality of the majority of the songs, not to mention the wonderful hidden bonus track, \\"The Way\\".
0316069353|5.0|A great timely story with page turning interest again by Michael Connelly.    The book review should not suffer because you cry babys are unhappy with the ebook price !  If you don't like the ebook price then don't buy it - wait for the paperback.
031603438X|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, very well written, entertaining and insightful. Richards is an interesting blend of self deprecation and cockiness, and it's clear that the music is the most important thing to him, not the celebrity BS. You could buy a stack of records from reading this book, he's very clear about his influences. Of course there's lots of gossipy stuff in here, including his heroin use, but it's a lot more about music than for example Clapton's autobio. Highly recommended.

6305428220|4.0|This review is specifically about the technical aspects of the DVD, not the movie itself.    This DVD (ASIN 6305428220, UPC 7-17951-0022-8-0) is the 1999 Dimension release of The Faculty, and it differs quite a bit from the 2011 Echo Bridge Home Entertainment release of the movie (ASIN B004P7CN7W, UPC 0-96009-75089-3).    Video:  Dimension = Letterboxed widescreen in 4:3 format, so your widescreen TV will show a small picture with big black bars on all four sides.  Echo Bridge = Anamorphic 16:9 widescreen, so it will take up the entire screen of your widescreen TV.  Both releases are Region 1 NTSC (even though the Echo Bridge release does not specify this on the back sleeve).    Audio:  Dimension = The movie is Dolby Digital 5.1 (384Kbps).  The menu does not have sound.  Echo Bridge = The movie is Dolby Digital 2.0 (192Kbps).  The menu has music in Dolby Digital 5.1 (448Kbps).  Both releases have one audio track only (English).    Subtitles and closed captioning:  Dimension = English subtitles available and closed captioning available.  Echo Bridge = No subtitles.  No closed captioning.    Bonus features:  Dimension = \\"Bonus features\\" are the theatrical trailer and film recommendations.  Echo Bridge = No bonus features.    Other thoughts:  The chapter stops are in different places.    No, I did not make a mistake listing the audio details for the Echo Bridge release; it really does have Dolby Digital 5.1 in the menu, but only Dolby Digital 2.0 in the movie.    The only bad part about this Dimension release (and the only reason to consider the Echo Bridge release) is that the video is letterboxed, so a widescreen TV will show the picture with black bars on all four sides.    If you care about the audio and/or you want subtitles, then get this Dimension release.  If you want to use the full screen of your widescreen TV, and you don't care about the audio or lack of subtitles, then you'll probably be happier with the Echo Bridge release.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|To: Whomever it concerns:                                 April 12th, 2011                                                                                        I just wanted to thank whoever was responsible for the great packaging job that was done on the DVD complete series I purchased and received this week. I've been a huge fan of Star Trek since I can remember and absolutely love the series \\"Star Trek\\": Enterprise: The complete series. It arrived the other day just as Amazon had promised, the outside box was crushed on the end, and I was worried briefly that the product had been damaged, but when I got it opened and inspected it I found it to be in excellent shape. I've been watching it as much as I can and it's great to finally own it. Thank you very much for a job well done.

The only reason I gave this Echo Bridge release two stars instead of one is because it's anamorphic widescreen, so it takes up the full TV screen without having to zoom.    I can't understand why Echo Bridge would decide to release this with only 2-channel audio, no subtitles, and no closed captioning.  For those reasons, I would recommend that people get the original (Dimension) release instead of this Echo Bridge release.  However, if you only care about the video, and don't care about the audio or lack of subtitles, then you'll probably be happy with this Echo Bridge release.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I used this memory module to upgrade HP Color LaserJet CP2025dn printer. It works just fine.<br />When installing, make sure the module is inserted all the way down, before you flip it in the fully vertical position. The metal ears should match the indents in the memory module when it is properly installed.<br /><br />To take advantage of the upgraded printer memory, in Windows, go to \\"Devices and Printers\\", right-click on the upgraded printer, select \\"Printer properties\\", go the \\"Device Settings\\" tab, and under \\"Installable Options\\" change the \\"Printer Memory\\" setting.<br /><br />To see how much available memory your printer has, you can try viewing printer's device configuration settings over the printer's web interface. For example, my printer had 128 MB of memory from the factory, plus this 256 MB upgrade, equals 384 MB total. Out of these the printer reported 352.39 MB available to the user. Therefore I instructed Windows to use up to 352 MB of printer memory.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network is a breakneck paced drama about the genesis and evolution of Facebook and the people who were elevated to iconic status (namely Mark Zuckerberg) and those who were betrayed and left behind in the process.  Yet it is so multifacted and complex that it actually benefits from repeat viewings not only to appreciate the accomplishments of the creative team involved, but also to absorb the full scope of the tragedy that lies beneath its ultra sleek surface.<br /><br />When I first viewed The Social Network, it was hard to ignore the nearly deafening critical acclaim that the film was being met with.  Not only was it being hailed as the film of the year, but it was also being referred to as the film of the decade and a movie that defined a generation.  It was going to be quite difficult for any movie to live up to those unfair expectatiions.  Still, I was impressed with the film on my first viewing.  David Fincher's direction had an almost clinical precision to it.  Trent Reznor's score seemed to capture the tone of the film perfectly.  The performances were superb, particularly Jesse Eisenberg, who absolutely nailed the narcassistic persona of the Facebook founder.  And of course Aaron Sorkin's screenplay was smart, scathing and funny all at the same time.  The Social Network was an unflinching and unsentimental account of the rise of the Facebook empire and the friendships that were destroyed in the process.  Yet for all of its technical saavy and zeitgeist qualities, the movie left me feeling a bit cold.  It was a movie that was easier to respect than to love.<br /><br />But then I watched it a second time and was blown away by all of the subtleties I had missed the first time around--not just in the machine gun fire pacing of Sorkin's dialogue but in the nuances of the characters as well.  Zuckerberg, for example, is not driven by mere greed to create Facebook but rather from a deep rooted sense of insecurity.  He is driven by the need for recognition and to be the first person to revolutionize social networking.  He also seems to be full of a sese of self hatred that stems not only from his own insecurities but also from his mistreatment of the people who matter the most to him.  Most notable are his girlfriend who he breaks up with at the film's beginning and his best friend and business partner (Andrew Garfield) who gets left out in the cold when Facebook becomes bigger than anyone expected.  In order to hide the disgust he feels with himself, Zuckerberg plays the role of an arrogant, power hungry jerk that nobody is capable of liking.  He seems incapable of, or unwilling to understand why he is all alone atop his self-created empire.  Again, much praise goes to Eisenberg for capturing all of these facets of Zuckergerg while effortlessly handling Sorkin's high octane dialogue.<br /><br />The closing scene of The Social Network is a stinging statement on just how alone Mark Zuckerberg truly is despite the fact that he has created the most popular social networking website ever seen.  To paraprhase one of his attorneys in the closing scene, he's not a jerk--he's just trying hard to be one.  It is that quality of Zuckerberg's extremely fragile persona that drives his every action and leaves him alone in the end.  It is also what gives this smart and insightful story of success and betrayal a much needed soul.on and to be the first person to revolutionize social networking.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Pat Smear is back! He comes and goes. He was on the first two albums and now he is back as a member. Very bizarre. Not sure why he left. I know he was touring with the Foo Fighters also, but now it seems like he's a full member again. Anyway, this album is great. The foos don't have a bad album. That being said, this is on par with their first three which were by far Grohls best. I love the sound on this album with that 90's feel to it. Analog! Can't wait to see them live again.
B0045HCIYA|3.0|I can't speak for anyone else, but a for myself, I considered this Movie to be ok, but it's NOT great.  Besides, the Title is \\" STRIPTEASE \\"; and my Definition of that is the person is going to take Everything OFF, but Demi Moore  DIDN\\"T take Everything OFF; all she had become was Topless, but that's as far as she had gone.  Because the Title is STRIPTEASE, Demi Moore Should have taken Everything OFF, right down to her Birthday Suit.  How ever had come up with this Title, had made a HUGE Mistake; that's also known as False Advertising!  The word  STRIPTEASE means just like it sounds, taking EVERYTHING OFF, not taking / removing a Percentage { % } of there clothes, BUT Everything; and Demi Moore Didn't take Everything OFF, so that means to me that the person / people that had placed this Title for this film, had Purgerd themselves { Lied }, and Advertised FALSELY!       Advertising FALSELY is Illegal, and anyone that Advertises Falsely can and will in the end get into BIG Trouble!

I love musical movies, so if you are into musicals you will love this movie!  And Burlesque is a different topic that no one else has currently touched.  So, definately a different view of music in a different ganre.  I give this movie a ton of hand claps to! :)

080214473X|5.0|In 1992, after years of violence, famine, and political turmoil in Somalia, President George W. Bush instituted Operation Provide Relief.  In conjunction with UN projects in the area at this time, Operation Provide Relief was created in order to help the impoverished located specifically in Mogadishu. After the creation of a second program called Operation Restore Hope, the United States Armed Forces successfully began to make a difference in the lives of millions. It was only when America decided to try to help turn Somalia into a democracy did they overstay their welcome. Bowden begins recounting the events here.   When the American military began to try to unite the warlords in Somalia under a democratic banner, the purpose of their mission began to change. In an attempt to keep the combined efforts of the US and UN from becoming undone, America attempted to unite the warring clan leaders. All consented to this agreement except for Mohammad Farrah Aidid who was the most powerful warlord. Using fear and propaganda, Aidid slowly began to turn Mogadishu's public opinion against America. It was at this point that Howe, the Admiral overseeing America's military presence in Mogadishu, \\"clamped on\\" to Aidid and was determined to remove him from the picture. After months of inadequate Intel, a mission was finally executed. On October 3rd, 1993, almost 100 Rangers and Delta Force members were dropped into a market in the middle of Mogadishu for what was supposed to be a quick snatch and grab. However, when the first black hawk goes down, the mission changes completely. What was supposed to be a two hour mission turned into a few dozen soldiers verses the entire, well-armed city of Mogadishu in an overnight siege.   Through extensive interviews with many of the men who were involved in the battle, Mark Bowden does an excellent job in recounting the battle in its entirety. The vivid descriptions of the battle scenes and anecdotes (my personal favorite-a \\"skinny\\" riding a cow with an AK-47) help to flesh out the different points in the battle. The only problem that I found was trying to keep all of the different battle scenes straight. I believe that this is of no fault to the author but only another illustration of the type of battle that was being fought. After most all of the chaos was finished, Sergeant Durant was taken hostage. His recount of events was an inspiring story of hope and terror as he was kept prisoner by the same people who were dragging the bodies of two of his comrades through the streets. The megaphone on the Little-birds saying \\"We will not give up on you Durant\\" set the tone for his time as a POW. Eventually, Durant was released and soon after, America withdrew their force from Mogadishu.   A total of 19 soldiers were killed in action and 83 were wounded. As a work of historical non-fiction, Black Hawk Down is brought to life by the time and effort Bowden put into its pages. \\"God Bless America\\" and all of its heroes.

0517548232|2.0|I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then.  Like most books that claim to have \\"the answer,\\" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world.  Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts.  There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Our daughter has been enjoying Wubs, as we call him, since she was 3 months old. Now she's 20 months and she still likes having him around. I can't imagine having used a regular pacifier at this point. Wubs has been such a big part of her life. We have two so that one is available while the other is in the washing machine. She actually demands both of them when she goes to bed or takes a nap though.     She'll be weened off the pacifier soon. We might buy a third and clip the pacifier off of it so she can still keep the monkey as a toy/companion. We could do that with one that we own now, but I wouldn't want to do that to one of them.    We bought two of the giraffe Wubbanubs for our new daughter who is now 10 weeks. The monkey is easily the cutest, but we needed to differentiate.     If you're on this page and are considering purchasing...do so now! You won't regret it. I just can't believe these have not made their way into the big retailers. Either the company hasn't approached them or the buyers for these retailers don't have kids and don't have a clue.
B001853NZK|4.0|We bought this for Pokemon cards.  It really would work for any kind of collection.  It's a good, sturdy binder that takes standard 3-ring pages.
0800179501|5.0|While comical and corny (skills/speed/leverage considered, a skinny little, puny, wimpus-maximus, stick boy like Ralph Macchio could never beat up anyone - unless the other guy is drunk and he can stab him with a knife like in The Outsiders), this movie is great.    The best parts of the movie are when Daniel realizes the unconventional training methods are providing him a base of knowledge to work from and the birthday party where Mr. Miyagi presents Daniel with the choice of one of the cars that he cleaned and waxed.    Elisabeth Shue is so pretty it's a shame she didn't have a bigger part in the movie, but it's unrealistic that a girl like that would have anything to do with a loser like Daniel Laruso.

B002ZG99CC|1.0|Will Smith has proven he is as greedy as Charlie Sheen is. He does not care about quality, only quantity. This movie is terrible. Will Smith's kid CANNOT act at all. He is an obvious little hoodlum from the ghetto, the apple not falling far from the tree. The singular act of jacket on, jacket off does not compare at all to the original wax on, wax off, sand the floor, paint the fence and house routines of the original Karate Kid movie.    Jackie Chan should stick to comedy movies, for that is his strength. Will Smith's kid should become a greeter at Wal-Mart, for he will probably never be good at anything.    There are many fools in this world. The success of this movie is one example of proof of such. Fools easily part with their money. I waited until the local public library had a copy of this movie that I could view freely. I tried to remain open-minded and give it a chance, even though I cannot stand the Smiths. This movie confirmed my suspicions and ranks amongst the worst I've ever seen.    Boring!
0316069485|4.0|I've always been a big fan of Connelly's character, Harry Bosch, who was the star of his early works...I haven't really liked Bosch's half-brother and defense attorney, Mickey Haller, that showed up in a few of Connelly's later books.  Although The Reversal is written from Mickey's perspective (ie this is technically a Mickey Haller book), Harry Bosch and Maggie McPherson play significant roles.  Even Rachel Walling makes an appearance.  Believe it or not, Mickey has crossed over to the other side of the aisle...he is serving as an independent prosecutor on a case involving the abduction and murder of a young girl by a tow truck driver in 1986.  Why prosecute the case now...it's been 24 years since the murder?  Well, Jason Jessup, the tow truck driver, was found guilty in 1986 but a DNA analysis which wasn't available in 1986 has raised a concern that Jessup is innocent...thus a reversal by a higher court and the need for a new trial in L.A.  The Reversal isn't Connelly's most action packed book he has ever written but I certainly enjoyed it and had trouble putting the book down.  The new Mickey was less ruthless and in my opinion more likeable.  I think we will see more Haller/Bosch plots in the future.

B0006HC0I2|5.0|\\"Touchez Pas au Grisbi,\\" (\\"Don't Touch the Loot,\\") (1954).  In another triumph of classic French cinema, Jacques Becker's tight - 94 minutes--black and white action/ crime thriller/film noir stars Jean Gabin( [[ASIN:0780020707 Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection]],[[ASIN:B002E01M9W Essential Art House: Le Jour se L&egrave;ve]]) as Max, called le Menteur, an aging, world-weary gentlemanly gangster who believes he can retire after he and his friend Henri Ducros, known as Riton, make a big score: eight bars of gold, then worth 50 million francs.  But he soon discovers that a competitor has his eye on the takings: brutal crime boss Angelo Fraiser (Lino Ventura ,[[ASIN:B002FKCAVU SICILIAN CLAN (1969)]]), who heard about the job from round-heeled chorus girl Josy, (Jeanne Moreau - [[ASIN:B0007989ZC Jules and Jim - Criterion Collection]]).<br /><br />Becker ([[ASIN:B0006HC0GY Casque d'Or - Criterion Collection]],[[ASIN:B00005NFZA Le Trou - Criterion Collection]]), is known to have enjoyed making gangster flicks, and he made a few.  This one, filmed in a Paris that seems to sparkle, is, in fact, as dark, gritty, and exciting as any he made.  It was a hit when released, despite the fact that, at that time, it was considered to have no stars.  Gabin had had a number of flops, and was perceived as being washed-up: this movie proved his comeback vehicle.  Ventura would go on to make more than 50 films, but this was his first--someone had recommended him to the director as a man who looked like a gangster; at the time, having been a wrestler, he was working as a wrestling promoter.  Moreau was very young, and if it wasn't her first film, she hadn't made many - she hardly looks like herself.  Daniel Cauchy, who played Fifi, a young member of Angelo's gang, was also making his first movie: he'd been an illustrator.  But someone had recommended him, too, to the director as a man who looked like a gangster.  He would go on to do 20 years of gangster pictures, including [[ASIN:B0000633SC Bob le Flambeur - Criterion Collection]].<br /><br />This film was, to be sure, highly influential on the crime films that would follow.  It's absorbing, character-driven, with considerations of love, friendship and morality at its heart.  The script is faultless: the picture is hard-charging and hard-edged, tough, yet it has an evocative, romantic atmosphere.  The director's treatment of the crime milieu is matter-of-fact, his tale narrated with great understatement, then, surprising violent episodes.  Gabin turns in his usual man of the people performance: hardened, but humorous. It's a powerful movie that works its way to a shootout on dark, empty country roads, with an ending no viewer will soon forget.Flambeur - Criterion Collection]].

B000ZELISO|5.0|Being a huge Potter fan in both the films and books, I have to say that this is the best of the films released so far. The transfer on Blu-ray is rather soft, but not in any way out of being a bad transfer; it is simply the way the film was intended to look, apart from some slight artifacts in dark spots. I think it's rather gorgeous myself. The film forsakes some of the finer points of the book in order to keep a more palpable rhythm and mood that make this by far the most emotionally intense of the Potter experiences. The film stands on its own as a great piece, regardless of how close it is to the book. Everything that was abridged was done so with class and reason that only helps to streamline the Potter story into one of greater emotional depth and slightly faster plot development for its transfer into the film medium. Highly Recommended.     The Film: A  The Transfer: A-  Extras: B

B0000029PC|5.0|Of all composers, George Szell had a special love and affinity for Schumann. He championed the symphonies when Schumann was relatively unknown outside of Germany. This set is the culmination of Szell's lifelong efforts. The scores performed here are his own, containing corrections to what he believed to be errors of balance in Schumann's orchestration. These retouchings uncover a freshness and vitality in these scores not unlike like the process of restoring frescoes. The result is Schumann with clean, clear lines. Although some considered Szell's revisions controversial at the time, they are hardly radical---especially considering the hash modern generations have made of Schumann.    Szell and the Cleveland deliver satisfying and extremely distinctive renditions of each symphony. The readings are crisp, assured and singing, the intepretations noble. The tempi, chosen deliberately, are tastefully judged, intelligently argued, with a fine balance between quicker and more moderate. Even when a brisker pace is chosen (in the Second and Fourth), a convincing case is made in each case, so that the faster pace still does not sound rushed. The orchestral play is topnotch. There is none of the exaggeration or crudeness found in the interpretations of many others (including, for instance, Sawallisch). Rhythm, critical to good Schumann, is masterful. The slow movement of the Second symphony is as poignant as any version there is. I have not heard a Fourth that evokes the cumulative intensity of the one in this set. You would be hard pressed to find better renditions of the First, Second or Third anywhere.    There are other worthy sets of the Schumann symphonies, certainly messier ones. The fact is, Szell's pioneering cycle influenced most if not all that have come in the decades since, and is still a benchmark.    There are interesting interpretations to be found in Jerzy Semkow's set with the Saint Louis Symphony.   Antoni Wit's cycle on Naxos is competitive, great on the Second and Fourth. Hans Zender's First, Second, and Fourth are idiomatic and outstanding, offering fresh insights and nuance. Michael Schonwandt's Third and Fourth on Chandos are polished and good. Sawallisch's highly acclaimed set is inconsistent. His Second and Third are excellent, but his First and Fourth are crude and rushed. Armin Jordan's cycle on Erato is mainstream and straightforward. Eliahu Inbal's sets are good, with quite elastic tempi (but with a particularly strong Second). Rafael Kubelik's two sets are respectable, but his presentations can be fussy and constricted. Mehta/Vienna lacks a point of view, as does the polished and boring Haitink, and Hans Vonk, whose set has some high points and many inconsistencies and flaws. Michael Gielen's disc with the Second and Third is interesting, combining a traditional approach with something approachig period practice. Paul Paray's recordings with Detroit from the 1950s are generally fast and very rough, but both of his recordings of the Second (with Detroit and with the Israel Philharmonic) are outstanding.  Kurt Masur's cycles hit or miss, depending on the work. Of period practice interpreters, Phillippe Herreweghe's cycle is satisfying, not as annoyingly archaic as other period sets. Giulini recorded two heavy, imposing versions of the Third, his best with the Philharmonia. Furtwangler's masterful recordings of the First and Fourth are, like the Szell recordings, essential, but in a category by themselves, and the same with Ferenc Fricsay's First and Ferdinand Leitner's Third, both rare one-off recordings on Deutsche Grammophon.    Other full sets are less successful. Konwitschny is idiomatic, but marred by slack execution. Chailly's set using the Mahler orchestrations is fascinating and deserves a listen, but the alterations are not completely successful. The same can be said for the overall performances. (Aldo Ceccato's Schumann cycle with the Bergen Philharmonic also uses the Mahler orchestrations, and isa less mannered and superior alternative to the Chailly versions.) Rudolf Schwarz is ultra lush, ultra romantic, with frequent (and I think inappropriate) legato. Gennady Rozhdestvensky's late 1970s set is one that was conceived as a Szell clone, but falls short on execution. Skrowaczewski's cycle is extremely sharp-edged and clipped, but not a first choice. Tamas Vasary's live set is exciting but erratic. The cycles of Suitner and Eschenbach are interesting but inconsistent. Klemperer and Celibidache are ponderous. Karajan is polished and faceless, full of forced affectations. James Levine, who trained under Szell, offers Szell-like clarity but harsh and muscular, minus the heart. Bernstein is hit or miss, Muti overcooked.  The historically-informed Gardiner, Norrington, and Harnoncourt fall short, as do more recent miniature treatments. David Zinman's set with the Tonhalle is combative, muscular/fast, and stiff.    In the end, simply put, for Schumann, Szell remains a standard.

B004L79VUI|1.0|Robbie Robertson was one of the most gifted songwriters and guitarists of his generation. I have enjoyed much of his music with the Band and as a solo artist  for years, however, this album is a disgrace. In my opinion, Robbie can no longer play the guitar with any ability....he no longer plays eloquent phrases but rather \\"paints\\" tones and atmosphere for his songs....even with that he sounds out of practice, rusty and uninspired. The only serviceable guitar on this album is played by Eric Clapton...perhaps it should have been released under his name because it seems more like one of his recent efforts. Lyrically, the songs on this album are cliched, overwrought, pompous and just laughable. Rolling Stone gave this album 4 stars and that's a joke. This is a major disappointment from an artist with the talent and ability that Robbie Robertson possesses. He may have earned the right to make any kind of album he wants but that doesn't mean I have to listen to something like this. IN MY OPINION THIS ALBUM IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE AND I ONLY GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE AMAZON WONT LET ME GIVE IT A ZERO
B0038M61BE|5.0|Anybody well steeped in the history of jazz will be familiar with the story of this recording, which goes something like: strung out, drug addled saxophonist who is out of work and out of luck is surprised by the announcement of his spouse that he has a recording gig at a local studio with the rhythm section of the then ubiquitous Miles Davis, so he dusts off his horn (literally), gets to the studio, is handed some lead sheets, and in the haze of a fading high, attempts to do a close reading of songs he is largely unfamiliar with, and pulls off one of the classic jazz recordings of the decade, if not of all time. Over the years, we can only speculate how much of this story is true and how much is embellishment, but what cannot be argued is that the quality of this recording and its overall musicianship and listenability is top notch. It's recordings like these that really make a person disappointed that there aren't more of them, more opportunities for these parties to have collaborated, maybe even in writing some original tunes together. I mean, Miles Davis' rhythm section was tighter than a conga drum head, and though at times you get the feeling they are carrying Pepper along with them, there are other times where you can't help but feel that Pepper has led them down a musical road they weren't planning to travel. The variety of tunes is great, the remastered recording is without glaring inadequacies. Red Garland's piano is ethereal at moments, while Philly Joe Jones and Paul Chambers keep the swing steady and strong. Pepper lays back when he wants, pops out when he wants, and generally adds just the slightest amount of risky instability to the steadiest support group from that era of jazz. This is just a great jazz album, a must have for Miles Davis, Art Pepper and honking sax fans, and a definite cornerstone of any serious aficionado's collection. Note that this is also available in the [[ASIN:B001GLHS3Y Return of Art Pepper/Modern Art/Art Meets The Rhythm Section/Art Pepper Quartet]] compilation, which may represent a better value for money.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|... I felt like it could have been a little bit more substantial. It's worth the price of admission for the SNL and 30 Rock stories alone. It's rare you get a behind the scenes look at successful television shows, and it's always fun to read about the cast dynamics, crew stories and hilarious anecdotes that happen when a bunch of funny people get together. And this book provides that, although I was left wanting more after I finished it. The childhood stories are OK, but even by Fey's own admission, she only had one \\"regular\\" job so there isn't a lot that one can relate. I guess I was mostly looking for more of a focus on the television and comedy writing, and instead I got a book that was more of a light hearted memoir that never dug in too deeply. That's fine, and I very much enjoyed the read, but I was left with a little bit of a desire for something more.
0316067938|5.0|Everyone is going to have their own opinions on this book, the other three, the characters, the storyline, etc.; but what it boils down to is that I cannot understand how anyone with at least a litle hope and imagination could anything but fall in love with this series.  It's an incredible journey about family, adventure, love, and believing in the impossible.  I've read them four times myself from cover to cover and am about to begin the 5th.  I love soaking up every word.  Readers are so critical; stating that Bella shouldn't have done this, or that Jacob shouldn't have done that, or Edward never would have said this.  I don't understand these complaints.  Everything ends up as it should be in the end and this is Stephanie's story.  We can't change situations in real life and we can't change someone else's story.  It's an incredible, beautiful novel and I just can't get enough of them.

B004LAIU4I|3.0|I'm not a fan at all of religious music, but I'm a big time Paul Simon fan, that said I really love the music here, but I take fault with the lyric.     Maybe this is because Paul has growing children with his wife Edie or maybe this is just Paul's frame of mind at this point in his life, but for me personally I'm not interested in his religious callings.    Don't get me wrong here I really do love the music on this CD, the tabla's on the third track \\"Dazzling Blue\\" are a welcome break from what sounds to me to be a overly compress CD and I might add that you do get the feeling like your sitting in the room as the CD was being recorded although not much coming out of the left & right channel just a binaural sound.    OK, now where is the Simon & Garfunkel CD I've been waiting all these years for. :)    P.S. It was his performance last week on \\"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\\" that made me want to buy this CD... I don't regret it either.
B004LFO0FG|1.0|Words cannot describe how breathtaking this CD is. It is easy to understand why this hot new collection has already sold millions of copies the world over. The fabulous Britney Spears {along with her fellow top 40 and rap contemporaries} have blessed our generation with three vital things sorely missing from all music that came before her....ORIGINALITY, ARTISTRY, and most of all, TALENT!     Indeed, few musicians in recent decades can compare with the overwhelming musical ability that Spears injects into every fiber of every song on this incredible album! When it comes to sheer vocal talent, Brit has no equal. When she dips into her lower registers, there's a haunting and soulful feel that would make Karen Carpenter proud. And her upper registers RIPS with operatic ruptures that would intimidate inferior singers like Celine Dion into an early retirement!     However, outstanding vocals can only get you so far, and Spears has always had much more to offer than that. Her groundbreaking guitar solos are so jaw-droppingly inventive that Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, or Chet Atkins sound like total idiots in comparison. Her drumming is rock steady, her complex bass lines flow like water, and her piano playing is also of the calibre that classically trained musicians like Ronnie Milsap or Billy Joel could never compete with. While most stars can only play one or two instruments, Spears is responsible for every note played on this amazing collection of songs!     Then, of course, there is songwriting ability, which is something that Britney has taken to a level beyond anything Beethoven or Mozart ever dreamed of! Britney's lush compositions are so incredibly sophisticated in both lyrics and melody that they more than deserve their place at the top of the charts. Every song here stands on it's own as a timeless masterpiece of American music, and each one makes a truly unique musical statement that is only enhanced by the radiant musical prowess that IS Britney Spears! For both musicians and songwriters the world over, her unmistakable talent is undeniably inspiring and refreshing...     Thank God that after sixty plus years of horrible music with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, we have been blessed with the true artistry that Miss Spears has given to our culture. The 20th century was a terribly bleak time for American music in terms of sheer talent and originality, but here in the 21st century Brit has elevated an art form to standards we may never be priviledged to witness again.     And how do I know that everything I've said here is true??? Because unlike many people, I turn to the right sources to help me decide what music I should be listening to. I allow MTV, Simon Cowell, and my local DJ to do my thinking for me because these people are the experts who understand what REAL TALENT and GREAT MUSIC is all about!!!     Enough said. If you don't own this CD, you were born without a brain.....
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|Ah, finally real talent.  This girl writes her songs, has an amazing voice and, if you watch her on youtube, see that she is a great, fun performer and personality as well.  This is a very good debut album, with a lot of variety which showcases her abilities and talent and I hope she becomes a success in the States.  I think she actually sounds better in some of the live clips on youtube than on the album, which is even more impressive.  At first, with the makeup and costume, I actually expected someone who couldn't sing.  But, she certainly can.  And quite well.  Yes, there is a bit of the oversinging/showing off acrobatics of the Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera variety, but not as over the top as those two.  But, I suppose this is what 23 year olds do when trying to show the world how talented they are.  And she is.  Totally worth buying.
B004M20YDU|3.0|The bottom line about this album, is you don't want the whole thing. There are only a handfull of descent tracks on here, and which those are... is specific to the listener (with a few exceptions).<br /><br />Giving you a song by song breakdown is pointless, because techno more than any other genre is really hit or miss from one person to the next (at the risk of being redundant). So skip the CD, look up the tracks on youtube, give them a listen, and buy the ones you think are worth it.<br /><br />I love the derezzed remix, glitch mob made the perfect electronic song in my opinion. I also really enjoyed \\"Fall\\", and one or two others, but the rest aren't worth a purchase. But again, that's my opinion. Just don't throw your money away on the whole CD.
1400079144|1.0|In his book \\"On Writing\\", Stephen King says something to the effect of having no right to look down on any writer who is successfully publishing.  I agree, and you have to be impressed with Dan Brown's success - An iconic best seller, movies with A-list stars.  He is an entertainer, and is being rewarded for entertaining.    But I thought \\"Lost Symbol\\" was awful, for the following reasons (without going into details or spoilers): (1) rehashed plot, (2) superfluous extra characters, (3) characters repeating dialogue (poor editing?), (4) multiple, protracted, ridiculous dramatic scenes that way exceeded the \\"ticking whatever\\" that was present in EVERY one, (5) the hodge-podge of unrelated technologies and plot devices, particularly the chamber, (6) the James Bond movie \\"dangling them over the shark tank\\" treatment of prisoners, (7) a pretty lame \\"national crisis\\" and big secret, (8) the propensity of characters to be \\"shocked\\" and to exclaim \\"My God!\\".    It'll make a good action movie.    The trivia about Washington D.C. and various buildings/monuments was fun.    I just can't suspend disbelief and overlook bad plot development enough to get pleasure out of his writing - even as escapist reading...

B000SMWUPS|5.0|Most strollers have a crappy drink holder. I have the Peg Perego Si and the first time taking my baby out and about my drink fell on the floor and spilled everywhere. I then purchaced the sunshine kids accessory buggy buddy and now I just love my stroller. It is very functional as it can hold just about anything and even has a zippered pocket. I place keys, wallet,cell phone and usually a drink in it. Its also very sturdy. It folds up with the stroller so i dont have to take it on and off which is a huge bonus. The accessory buddy will probably fit all strollers and is a great addition to your sroller. anything that makes your life easier is worth it. I love it and recommend it.

B0034JKZ86|1.0|The voodoo in this movie gave me the creeps, and I'm an adult! I will not be letting my daughter see this movie and I definitely wouldn't call it a 'kid's movie.' Having the story set in New Orleans should have been interesting (especially the music, one would think) but instead it was just plain terrible. It would be difficult to identify what the worst part of the movie was: the satanic themes, the scary shadows and death scene (not fit for young children!), the painfully slow plot development, the obnoxious poorly written songs, the incredibly boring dialogue, the stereotypical characters (which I'd imagine could be offensive to some), the lame prince, or just the overall bad experience. Will definitely never see it again or recommend it to anyone. The highlight of the movie was when the firefly shot out of a person's nose. Seriously.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I loved the whole concept of Slash matching his songs up with different singers, and choosing Myles Kennedy to tour with was nothing short of genius. This is clearly his best work since GnR days, and in some cases, better. I absolutely love \\"Back From Cali\\", \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" is amazing, but then again, this album has something that is going to appeal to everyone. It's exactly what he promised, Rock and F'n Roll, and I say he delivers in spades. This is absolutely recommended.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|There is just something about this movie that grabs me.  Let me explain.<br /><br />The story is probably well known by now.  There's the evil Master Control Program (MCP) that is taking over not only all programs at Encom corporation, but also all programs across the world, including those at the Pentagon and Kremlin.  Behind all of this is the over ambitious and sneaky Ed Dillinger, played by David Warner, who having stolen Encom's most successful game programs written by brilliant and cocky programmer, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), has been promoted way beyond his abilities and is being pushed around by the MCP.  Of course, the MCP is actually a very advanced artificial intelligence program, smarter than any program ever written, and way beyond today's technology.  The same applies to other programs, which are lesser AIs that relate to their users as a mortal would relate to an Olympian god.  And that's really the mold of this movie, mere programs (read mortals) struggle to believe in the existence of users (read olympian gods), until Jeff Bridges, as Kevin Flynn (the god of programming), is physically teleported into the world of computer programs.  His goal: to liberate all by blowing the MCP to smithereens and to recover evidence that proves that he, and not Dillinger, is the author of Encom's cash cow game programs.<br /><br />This is one of the earliest computer animation attempts that I know of and, admittedly, the animation is limited, consisting of lines and surfaces in monochrome.  Yet it works!  The look and feel of the computer world is consistent enough that you believe you are in some strange abstract world, maybe not inside a computer, but certainly inside some fantasy world.  And there's just enough geeky computer lingo thrown in to make you chuckle, like \\"Bring in the logic probe,\\" to break down a doorway, or \\"No microcircuit can contain you, Tron,\\" as Tron's girlfriend says with adoration.  Yet another appeal is the play between the real world of the office and the virtual world of the computer, connecting the movie to every day life, though in a wildly exaggerated way.  We see Tron's programmer (or user), for example, working in a sea of cubicles stretching as far as eye can see--I could swear there were over a thousand cubicles there on one floor.  And the industrial section where the laser device that teleports Flynn is situated looks like some giant power plant ready to spark a fusion reaction.<br /><br />And then there's the nostalgia, not intentional but there all the same.  We walk into Flynn's game arcade knowing that the producers at the time thought the place as some cool hip place to hang out with no idea how transient arcades would be.  Yet there, in that crowded space of computer games, there is noise and action and energy and romance.  And there's that classic little phrase \\"Klaatu barada nikto\\" printed on computer paper and tucked away in a cubicle paying homage to the 1951 movie \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\\"<br /><br />In the end, there is a lot here that parallels today's computer dominated world.  Freeing the world of some MCP: is that not what people in the world are struggling to do now, to access information free of some Master Control State?

We see Tron's programmer (or user), for example, working in a sea of cubicles stretching as far as eye can see--I could swear there were over a thousand cubicles there on one floor.  And the industrial section where the laser device that teleports Flynn is situated looks like some giant power plant ready to spark a fusion reaction.    And then there's the nostalgia, not intentional but there all the same.  We walk into Flynn's game arcade knowing that the producers at the time thought the place as some cool hip place to hang out with no idea how transient arcades would be.  Yet there, in that crowded space of computer games, there is noise and action and energy and romance.  And there's that classic little phrase \\"Klaatu barada nikto\\" printed on computer paper and tucked away in a cubicle paying homage to the 1951 movie \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\\"    In the end, there is a lot here that parallels today's computer dominated world.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I recently bought this new version because of the movie coming out 15th of April and I must say it has a great new look and much better graphics! Very 3D as some would say but overall this game is great if your a fan of Angry Birds. Do note that the game only comes with two levels because the rest will be released later in the future.
B004BLTNL6|5.0|This movie is a classic! I have been searching for this movies for at least 2 years and found it on Amazon.com.  It was a drama that could be so close to real it was amazing.  Love that movie!!!!
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I loved Kate Morton's first two books and was so excited when I saw the release of \\"The Distant Hours\\".  I didn't buy it immediately as I knew I was getting a Kindle and wanted to purchase the book electronically.  I just finished it this morning and I have to say, I was disappointed in this book. Although the story was good, I really hated the \\"bouncing\\" around between the early 1990's then back to WWII and points in between. I can handle a bit of that when reading but when it changes with each chapter, it's a bit much for me.  I also felt that some parts of it were quite predictable (I won't go into it here as I don't want to spoil it for people reading these reviews pre-purchase.)  I am still a fan of Ms. Morton and will definitely look for her next book - maybe she'll redeem herself in my eyes!
0756404738|5.0|I read this book's predecessor, [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]], back in 2008. So addicting was the story Mr. Rothfuss wove in that book that I unintentionally finished it in one sitting on a Saturday. I literally could not put it down!    With that in mind, I have been eagerly awaiting [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 2)]], and having read it (this time intentionally in one go) I am thrilled to say it was incredible. \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" carried the tale of Kvothe further, answering some questions but tantalizing you with more. It has twists unexpected and lots of action. There are several moments when, upon realizing what just transpired, you sit back and think - \\"Woah. That was... wow.\\"    \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\", while excellent in itself, will shine brightest if you've read the first book. Then, it will blow you away and leave you hungry for the next book to come. And yes, that may be a while due to Mr. Rothfuss' obsessive revisions, but who can complain when the results are so magnificent? Like a master craftsman or artist slowly shaping his work, paring it down to the essence and setting it in beauty, Mr. Rothfuss takes the time to carve an intricate and intimately real story, which is worth every moment of wait.    So read [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]], and then read [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 2)]]. Buy them for yourself. Buy copies for your family, and your friends. Spread the wonder that is this tale; you will love every letter of it, and those you share it with will too.

Whether you're a memory geek or just an informed reader who enjoys a good book, buy this right away.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Foer's next book, regardless of topic.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down once I started reading it. Very well written with an ending that inspires 'hope'.
159102594X|4.0|Most reviewers already gave a summary of the story, hence I'll keep it short.<br /><br />The only dislike I had is a minor one, I had to get used to his writing, for the character Glokta Joe Abercrombie used sentences in italic for when Glokta spoke or answered a question in thought and used normal font what he actually said the thing. This for me felt cumbersome at first, but at the end of the book it felt allright, just something to get used to.<br /><br />His story has a lot of action happening and he describes this good, so you see in your mind what happens in enough detail to make it very entertaining and exhilarating.<br /><br />The story is epic in scale, being the whole book is an introduction of the characters, their motives and creation of this new world. I felt the real adventure had yet to begin, this part was a setup to the next two books in the trilogy.<br /><br />For all that love fantasy and action I recommend this book.

B003UESJ9W|3.0|I just got through watching this movie. I have been looking forward in seeing this picture ever since I saw Gweneth Paltrow sing on the TV Show Glee. When it comes to the music in this movie I think they did a really good job. While I did enjoy the music, the film lacked a strong storyline and character development. I kept comparing this film the classic film The Rose, which starred Bette Midler. By the end of the film, any comparison between the two movies completely died. While in The Rose, you have such a messed up person but you felt sorry for her. At the end of that film you sat there speechless because it was such a strong and emotional movie, not like Country Strong. In this movie you have another woman who is a mega country star. She is in rehab for drinking and pills. Her Manager Husband is a no good heartless person. Paltrows character though played well by her, lacks any emotion or sympathy due to the weak script and lack of character development. She falls for and up and coming country singer Beau and blows things with him. This movie could have been so much better is it had a better stronger script. The music was fine. The acting was very good. The script and character development ruined this film. I hope Ms. Paltrow continues to sing because she actually is pretty good. It's a shame it was wasted in this flick.
0316069353|5.0|I  just completed \\"The Fifth Witness\\" this weekend and it is one of the best court room books available. It is well written and never boring. It gets the reader into the mind of Mickey as he goes through the case and begins to look at his life. Connelly just gets better with each book. After reading one of his books you feel like you know the characters personally even some that you would just as well not know. Five Stars.    I noticed several of the kindle reviewers have lowered their ratings because of the price. This is not fair to the author or to Amazon. The publisher is the one that sets the price. The publisher will someday understand the free market system when they learn higher prices may bring in more money per book sold but a smaller number of books sold. That break point may or may not be > $10.00, the market will determine. I remember when a certain TV manufacter (Magnovox)tried to set the retail price, that worked for awhile but where are they now? Any publisher that doesn't adjust to new market will find themselves in the same place.
0375842209|5.0|To the almost many 5-star reviews of this exquisitely written, multi-layered, lovely book I have this nugget to add: if you want to experience it at a whole other level, try to get hold of the audio version read by Dennis Olsen. It is only available from Australia but well worth the effort and expense as it is achingly beautifully read. All the nuances of the text, its poignancy and humour are all brought out superbly (and his diction is to die for!). Be translated: listen, laugh and weep.

030745455X|4.0|I have not read an excellent thriller such as this one in many years. The storyline is full of suspenseful action from  beginning to end, it holds many suprises with cunningly planted twists and turns at the appropriate times, the mysteries are very well set. Although I have also found some forced events like in the first book, they are minor detail and do not blemish a plot that I ve enjoyed very much, and I am  looking forward to start the third book of this trilogy. Make sure to read first \\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\" to have a better understanding of this one. Excellent author
0385341679|4.0|There is a surprise ending to this review so keep reading. I had to give this book four stars for so many reasons it's going to be hard to not to fill page after page trying to explain. The Fever series was a huge step for Moning. She bid familiarity and comfort a hefty farewell when taking on the task of relaying Mac's story to the world. Unlike the paranormal romance genre that's been wrapped around every word she's written for years, Moning found herself lost in an Urban Fantasy, hearing the words directly from Mackayla Lane's mouth rather than simply seeing the story unfold and writing it all down as it happens.<br />With bold, dynamic characters, and a story that leaves you guessing each and every time, she makes the change beautifully. She uses not only her amazing ability with word play but her knowledge of fae legends and history to truly bring this world to life as if it were reality rather than just a mere story.<br />I deducted one star from my rating. Despite how well the book was written, I did not enjoy it. I've adore every word Moning has written from book one but this is the first book I've ever read that made me feel as though it were sucking the life out of me. Except for the very first book, each following installment took me weeks to finish because I felt like I was suffocating more and more with each passing chapter. However, I'm sure that's the way Mac was feeling also and it's the author's goal to have their readers feel what the character feels on every level. And KMM did this very well. It simply was not I feeling I enjoyed or would want to feel again.<br />The book was filled with mystery upon mystery.... Answers were never found only heightened. Once you thought you may be nearing the end of one conflict, another begins. It was as if Moning crammed every single twist and turn known to man into this series and there wasn't a happy ending in site until the very end. But even then it didn't feel completely like a happy ending.<br />This series simply wasn't for me. Now, for people who enjoy this style of writing, Karen Marie Moning delivers one hundred percent.... As usual.'t for me. Now, for people who enjoy this style of writing, Karen Marie Moning delivers one hundred percent.... As usual.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|What a pleasant surprise! This is an amazing album in and of itself, and is just as good as anything Foo Fighters have produced in their 16 years of existance. This record is so full of confident rock prowess that you will be convinced, as I was, that Foo Fighters is just as relevant as ever. I just love how Dave Grohl and the band have taken their many musical influences and associations and created music that honors them, while still retaining the tried and true Foo Fighters flavor. It's great to see Pat Smear back and that Dave's old Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic even appears one track. This is all about the crunchy, driving, loud and fierce guitar hooks carrying the poignant melodies to heights that always deliver. Don't hesitate; buy the album. For best results, heed the advice on the stamp on the outside of the album: Please play at maximum volume.
B004CRR9G0|3.0|I Love this movie.  I own the original VHS (when it was called \\"Warriors of the Wind\\") as well as the 'restored' DVD with new voice actors and added content (which cleared up the story a bit).  AND, on top of it, I also own the Manga series, so believe me when I say that I REALLY love this movie, and I'm an enormous fan of Miyazaki's.     Now the bad news... The 3 stars I am giving are NOT for the movie, but for the BluRay release.    I'm seeing a disappointing trend in BluRay titles regarding older titles.  I may be expecting too much, but if you're going to do something, do it right.  I was hoping the technical issues that were glaring on the DVD release (frame jitter, soundtrack dropout, etc..) would have been fixed or at least reduced in the BluRay version.  Or, as I said before, my expectation level is unrealistic and a complete restore is impossible.    I hope the latter is true, as I would hate to think that other great movies wouldn't get the effort they deserve when transfered to BluRay.  However, I do NOT regret purchasing this BluRay, and highly recommend fans of the movie to do so as well.  Why?  I want to see more of this genre on BluRay (at least the quality films), and lend my support when I can.    That being said, I hope 'Grave of the Fireflies' is next on the list.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|First off I enjoyed the graphic novel and the movie despite many differences.       Watchmen is not your normal comic book movie. This movie is very dark and is a satire focusing on human nature. Watchmen does not portray the classic comic book hero, in fact only one person has \\"super\\" powers; but rather it focuses on the more human aspects of the characters. That being said, it is not the most action packed movie of all time, but in my opinion is an exploration of human nature. The movie has a lot of characterization, each character being different in many ways; From the powerful Dr. Manhattan losing his grip on what made him human, to Rorschach the man who takes on the goal of defeating what he believes are humanities flaws. The characters are deep (not as deep as the book) and show the worst and best of humanity. All this being said, if you are looking for a fast paced story with lots of action Ironman may be a better bet. Violence and Adult themes wise, this movie is full of them. This is not a movie to show to children. The action scenes are gory, on par with Snyder's other work 300. There are scenes of sex,rape, and nudity throughout. All of this is holds true to the dark gritty atmosphere, and as fair warning if this offends you do not see this movie.     As far as the bonus content, I believe it added to the story, especially the former Night Owl. This may be as a result of reading the graphic novel however.     In general, I enjoyed the movie for its themes and how it stretches the goals and nature of humanity.
B000P0J024|4.0|If you're searching for Beatles, or should I say Beatleworthy tracks, on Wilbury releases, you have to restrict yourself to George Harrison material. Obviously.  But what do you do about tracks that are primarily George tunes but also feature vocals by Dylan, Petty, Orbison or Dylan? I say: Get rid of those alien non-Beatle vocals. However, then you'd end up with rather short songs. Solution: Obtain the extended-play dance-club version of each. Then use some rudimentary music-editing software to cut out every voice but George's for `Handle With Care' and every voice but George's--except for one verse sung by fifth Beatle Jeff Lynne--for `End of the Line'. The results are worth the trouble.  Then there's `Heading for the Light'. I would make its false ending the real ending, before the song's saxes wear out their welcome. Next there's `Maxine', a hauntingly wistful lost Wilbury track that has been re-produced and smoothed out since George's death, and is indeed preferable to the bootleg version (which isn't bad at all.) This is a highly unusual outing for George, lyrics-wise. The story told is more in the vein of Dylan or Petty than Harrison, but apparently George did write it. Mercifully, it's unambiguously about a young woman and not Krishna.  Anyways, there you have four Beatlesque/Beatlesworthy tracks from Wilbury land. I even obtained an instrumental-only version of `New Blue Moon' to capture some beautiful Harrison slide guitar licks, untrammeled by vocals.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Has to be the most useful app, hands down. Tells you facts about everything. I use it for math and science mostly. Overall amazing well done
B000002UQJ|3.0|I love Paul McCartney and don't want to denigrate his post-Beatles repertoire, but for a Beatles fan searching for solo Beatle material that's worthy of the Beatles, there ain't much here. There's `Biker Like an Icon', but `Paul is Live' has a more energetic, less precious version. And there's `Golden Earth Girl', sort of a companion piece to the Beatles' `Mother Nature's Son' (which was a de facto McCartney solo track). The collaborations with Elvis Costello aren't bad, but are unilikely to be songs you'll want to hear again and again. `Hope of Deliverance' is a bit borderline, but once again, a `live' version on `Paul is Live' is superior. Another borderline case is `Winedark Open Sea', especially if one makes the false ending the real ending.
B002ZG99QS|1.0|Before I begin my barrage of criticisms, let me say something: I have not seen the original, so what you are about to read isn't the rant of a fanboy.  This movie is utterly laughable, first of all, the plot is completely predictable, by the middle of the movie I could predict without error everything that would happen. The characters are lifeless shells, it makes you wonder if the actors were even trying. The special effects are pretty lame as well, the ships look silly and the glass-shattering injuries look dumb. The most impressive thing I can think of is seeing two Jeff Bridges, and that wears off quickly.
B000008GEF|3.0|I believe that by 1969, George had reached parity with John or Paul as a songwriter. Which was a stunning achievement, especially since the other two were often dismissive rather than supportive of George's efforts, even after the likes of `Taxman' and `While My Guitar Gently Weeps'.  That said, following the triumphs of `All Things Must Pass' and the concerts for Bangla Desh, apart from a few songs, `Living in the terial World' doesn't offer much to those UNentranced by Krishna consciousness. Being preached at by a very established religion on the other side of the world had already lost the appeal that novelty had provided. So, yes, for the vast majority of us, much of George's output did become dreary and boring, starting with  this album.  Of course, the two standout tracks here are `Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)', a masterpiece of interweave between pop music and religious sensibilities, a la `My Sweet Lord'. Apple almost released `Don't Let Me Wait Too Long' as a follow-up single, and should have. Here is one of Harrison's many songs to come where the loved one could be either an earthly woman or a heavenly deity, with most of us preferring the former interpretation.   Borderline is `Sue Me Sue You Blues'. Scavengers can find parts of `Living in the Material World', `The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord) and `Deep Blue' to savor.  Luckily for Beatles fans, `Beatle George' would continue to re-surface now and again over the ensuing decades.
0143039431|5.0|This is a great book. I finished reading this in December(now it's April) but I still remember how realistic this was written by Steinbeck.  He makes the characters come alive and breathe.  Their hard lives are seen as heroic and well done scenes in a long play.<br />  This is supposed to be a communistic version of California with the scenes of the goons beating up the union leaders.  Look now what is happening to destroy unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio(pretty soon New Jersey, Florida, and who knows). So Steinbeck was right in 1938 to portray unions as the enemy of the rich capitalist ranchers and agricultural powerful interests.  The poor Joads were only trying to do honest work and look what happened to them.<br />  First the banks wouldn't lend to them back in Oklahoma so they decided to travel to California to make a new living.  Then when they tried to make a little more money they were beaten by the union haters.  Their camp was destroyed by the owners.<br />  Supposedly John Steinbeck wrote this in 5 months in 1936 at the time of the Dust Bowl.  This is history that is rarely taught in America today.  Young people should read this American classic.  There is a Steinbeck Museum in Salinas, California and I hope to go there as soon as possible.
0316098337|5.0|Incredible book.  I had such a hard time putting it down!  And when I absolutely had to put it down I kept thinking about it and wondering what was going to happen next!  I loved it and it saddened me at the same time.  Fantastic story.

B004OA2G0E|3.0|My hunch is somebody in Radiohead hates this album, probably the guy who wants to play rock and roll. I gave the album many listens and the sadist thing of all - I shut it off half way through my last listen. This is a Thom York album and overall does not feel like a band effort. The uber cool video featuring only Thom doesn't help matters much either. There isn't one really great transcendent song on it and agree with many others that we are getting B-sides. I guess compromises needed to be met in order to keep the band together. I'll end this review by making a prediction about their next album - it will totally rock out maaaan.
0142414999|5.0|What a harsh title for a review, right? And I hate to say it. No one *wants* to point at the weak link and laugh. But it had to be said. The third and final novella went to Myracle and--fell somewhat flat. It wasn't horrible. And a lot of the buzzkill can probably be chalked up to its following the SUPERB PERFORMANCE given by John Green, but--I still found myself wanting a re-write. The book should not have ended on that note. I appreciated the way it tried to weave in elements from the previous two novellas (especially the final \\"Starbucks Pow Wow\\") but there wasn't enough meat to her story to hold up on its own. The plot was there. I just felt like we needed another 80 pages or so to really dig in and start caring about the story.    That said--    The first two novellas alone earn the full five stars. I've long been a John Green fan (and Nerd Fighter*) but I was pleasantly surprised to discover Maureen Johnson. It's true that her tale is mostly...er...romance**. And, yes, the male audience may more readily identify with Green's saga d'adventure but, hey--this book comes with a giant \\"Three Holiday ROMANCES\\" right there in the title. So...yeah. Promised. And delivered.    Finally--while it's easy to love the novellas as separate stories in their own right, the real magic comes from reading them all together as a sort of never-ending camera zoom. By the end of the novel(s?) the community takes center stage. The privilege of a first-person narrative is multiplied three fold. Not only do we see the inner workings of the individual characters, we see the thoughts that float across systems, the strangers that secretly root for each other. It makes for a truly heart-warming read. The perfect answer to the cynic in us all.    *You should probably be one.  **Totally unfair reduction of a story that is also: fall-off-your-chair funny, charming and quirky.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|My Swatch Once Again is fantastic! The hands glow in the dark and there are glow in the dark spots for each number. The face is really easy to read. The strap is soft plastic that stretched out comfortably. Its a really good watch and I would recommend it.
B004GHNHVW|4.0|Paul Simon himself didn't know what the theme of the album was before he was halfway recording the album; but now we all know what it is. Love and God, maybe the two main themes of life and that of course are kind repetitive.      And why?  Maybe because Paul Simon just wanted to ''care like hell and not give a damn at the same time''  and that's what explains the title ''So Beautiful Or So What'': express your feelings unconsciously; if it's beautiful -Hurray!- if not...So What!    In a more musical way of speaking Paul Simon is acting like an audio engineer in this album testing all the sounds surrounding him to fit them in the music. It can be diverting the use of a snare drum or using the sound of a steam engine slowing down.    A great album in which Paul Simon is doing what he does very naturally: experimenting.
159448385X|5.0|When my husband returned from serving in Iraq he spoke of a culture that values life, especially the life of women, far differently than in the United States. I had a hard time comprehending what living in that culture would be like until I read [[ASIN:159448385X A Thousand Splendid Suns]].<br /><br />The story of Mariam and Lilia are both at some point both abandoned by their families. Mariam's parents selfishly abandon her, while Lilia's parents selfless love is their undoing. These women survive not only the hardships of their family life, but the violence in Afghanistan since the mid-eighties.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns weaves Afghanistan history through a tremendous story in a way that gives insight and compassion for the citizens of this war-torn country. I am very glad I read this well-written novel.
0307454541|4.0|Slap-happy review here folks because if you are like me circa a month ago, you're one of the few people who actually had no idea what this book was about until you picked up a copy from your home-town bookstore because you just \\"happened\\" to speed read the end of your last novel and wanted to go buy a new book which you haven't allowed yourself to do in a REALLY long time.<br /><br />So, Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist and he gets sued and is found guilty and has to \\"quit\\" the magazine he started in order to secretly get revenge. Lo-and-randomly-behold he's hired by a rich old guy named Henrik Vanger (you know with a last name that starts with a V there's all sorts of drama to be had) who wants Mikael to write an autobiography of the Vanger family, but also to secretly research the decades-old disappearance/murder of Henrik's niece Harriet. Oh, and Henrik has \\"secret information\\" that Mikael can use against the guy that sued him. Hijinks and scandal ensue, and it's page-turningly good suspense. Oh! AND! The \\"girl with the dragon tattoo\\" is Lisbeth Salander and the book is titled after her but she's not really the main character which is intriguing. She's a super smart computer whiz who finds out lots of secret things that people aren't supposed to know and she assists Mikael in his investigations.<br /><br />Overall I am not disappointed. With all the hullabaloo I wondered if this book was going to be for moi, and I can happily say that it's definitely for moi and I do wish to be reading the sequel ASAP but good things come to those who wait and I shall not rush out and hop on your bandwagon. You have to get over the random translation issues, and you must try to remember all the various characters, because there are plenty, but then you realize that in this world of suspense-thrillers and paper-back-action-adventures this is one of the good ones and perhaps it's because he's not-of-this-country and also not-of-the-living.<br /><br />In conclusion: if you are like I was a month ago and wondering if you should finally get around to reading this book and wondering if it is really worth it, buy the cheap paperback or rent it from the library and ye shall not be disappointed if what you want is good suspense. Cheers.ndering if you should finally get around to reading this book and wondering if it is really worth it, buy the cheap paperback or rent it from the library and ye shall not be disappointed if what you want is good suspense.

Classic Disney at its finest...a determined heroine, a handsome hero, scary (but not too scary) villains, and a horse with a personality.<br /><br />Adults, teens and kids all loved this movie. I would highly recommend it and, as the song goes, mamma knows best.<br /><br />For parents of young kids, the wicked old woman in this movie is not as scary as the evil fairy, Maleficent, in [[ASIN:B0013ND30M Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)]], but not as benign as Stinky Pete in [[ASIN:B0030IIYYS Toy Story 2]]. Unless your child is easily freaked, I would say anyone 4 and older could handle this movie.
0770428231|4.0|The Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood is one of those books that really draws you in. Her description of Elaine's childhood paints a vivid experience for the reader.    At times almost disturbing, the story of her childhood memories and journey to overcome them was great. I am not a huge suspense type fan, for a book to keep me engaged through to the end is an accomplishment in and of itself. @herbookreviews
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Listen, we are big Harry Potter fans at our house. Everyone has read the books, seen the movies (at least on DVD) and listened to the audio books. We were really, really looking forward to seeing this movie.<br /><br />When we saw the PG-13 rating we sent our eldest son to preview it before we took the rest of the family (kids 11-8). This young adult came back from the theater saying that it was absolutely not for the kids. His biggest complaint: the nude scene of Harry and Hermione. (The scene is in page 376 in the book. Rowling never states they are undress. Why add it to the movie?See comment below) His other scene he found too disturbing for the kids was when Bellatrix tortured Hermione.<br /><br />My husband and I saw the movie (without kids) and found it to be so-so. The movie was at its best when more characters than just Harry, Rom and Hermione were on screen. Looking forward to seeing Part 2.<br /><br />Additional comments/clarifications:<br /><br />I am surprised at the number of comments this review evoked and feel I need to clarify some of my remarks and respond to some of the comments list below this review.<br /><br />1. I did see this movie. My 19 year old son went to the midnight showing opening night. My husband and I attended the following evening.<br />2. I actually have not read other reviews. I guess I knew I was going to this movie whether other people liked it or not.<br />3. It is true that the nude scene consists of Harry and Hermoine's bare shoulders, with smoke covering the rest of them. They are entwined in an embrace. It is not a scene most parents of elementary age kids (or at least this parent) finds appropriate and it probably contributed a great deal to the pg-13 rating. (OK, that and Nagini indwelling Bathilda Bagshot)<br />  Here is the thing, in the later Harry Potter books there is some snogging (kissing for you non-Brits), but J.K. Rowling choose not to go beyond that. I simply wished the filmmaker took the same route.<br />4. Yes, we all know the books mature as Harry get older. They get darker as well. Still, filmmakers were able to make a PG rated movie out of book 6,[[ASIN:B002PMV9FG Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)]]/(as well as books 1-3). I guess I was hoping for the same for Deathly Hallows, Part 1.<br /><br />Look, there were some great performances and moments in this movie. My personal favorite was Jason Issacs performance as Lucius Malfoy. He managed to communicate much with saying very little.<br /><br />I hope that helps clarify my earlier review.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I've always been a Foo fan, though admittedly, these last ten years have left me longing for a performance that rivaled that of their 1997 magnum opus, The Colour and The Shape.  Wasting Light is, quite simply put, the first album from Grohl & Co. that can legitimately stand among the efforts of that release.<br /><br />Paramount among its strengths is its foundation of raw, authentic instrumental quality, unspoiled by the ruinous touch of the modern computer-produced safety net which has managed to run off so many music fans with an ear for true talent.  In fact, there's nothing at all synthesized or computerized about this entire album from beginning to end: it's just straight-up, pure rock music.  (You've already heard about how it was recorded entirely in Grohl's garage on analog tape, so I'll spare you those details.)<br /><br />And it doesn't let up.  There really aren't any soft songs here, even though bits and pieces of the tracks (parts of A Matter of Time, Arlandria, and Walk) sometimes wander into a melodic safe zone before rebounding into the usual chugging, ripping guitar work (which dominates Bridge Burning, Rope, White Limo, and the Alice In Chains-esque Miss the Misery).  The choruses are all inevitably infectious, said to have been structurally influenced by the likes of the Bee Gees and ABBA (no kidding).  Fortunately, in spite of its relentlessly hard-edged design, Wasting Light's tunes all manage to stand apart from one another, built with idiosyncrasies which become increasingly evident upon subsequent listens.<br /><br />Though it isn't completely flawless, there really aren't any songs I don't enjoy on this album.  If I had to pick favorites, they'd probably be tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 (I find it's tough to narrow it down).  To say that this is the best mainstream rock album of the year is a bit of an anticlimactic understatement; more accurately, it's an attempt to bring mainstream rock back to the currents of raw talent which once carried its torch.  It's doubtful that the rest of the industry will take note in this time of digital Band-Aiding, but at least it proves that once in a blue moon we can depend on rock's heavyweights to break through the layers of mold and give us a reason to buy an album again.

B003JTHWJQ|2.0|He is just off on some of his facts, he presents hearsay as facts, he doesn't really tackle the hard questions and good arguments for the existence of God.    I'm giving him 2 stars instead of 1 for the simple fact that he was able to actually admit that there is really no way to know for sure that there is no God.      Otherwise, I'm just honestly not impressed.   If this is one of the better minds the atheists have to offer today, their cause is in trouble.

B002ZG98UA|4.0|Great to see Alice back along with the team! Wesker is believable as is Chris Redfield. I just did not like the attire for Chris; made him look like a car mechanic to me. The ending is a huge surprise! I will not have to tell RE fans there will be another sequel, possibly the last.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I have to admit that I was dissapointed and felt a little ripped-off. This book was mostly a very long set-up for a sequel. I have nothing against series but each book of a series should stand on it's own and I don't feel that this book did that very well.  I also would have enjoyed more developed story lines about some of the other characters and a lot less of the cheezy descriptions of the romance of the main two characters. The reviews compared it to Anne Rice but, other than the book is about vampires and witches, I don't think that is accurate comparison in terms of a quality story.
B00127RAJY|2.0|Honestly, from what others wrote, I thought this would be more advanced and more cardio. I only went through the whole first part and half of the second before I felt I was wasting my time and turned it off. Basically, the only cardio in the first half of the DVD are jumping jacks for which I definitely don't need a DVD to do. I thought this was more 'boot camp' like, and maybe for some, it is. But I'm used to one hour interval training classes at my gym with a tough instructor that doesn't quit, so this is extremely mild in comparison. I am going to forward to the last part, but even if that part ends up being totally different and I love it, I still bought a 3 part DVD only to use the last 20 minutes. It's my first Jillian Michaels DVD and maybe the others are better?
0670022411|5.0|I'm going to keep this short, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. It is always refreshing to read a vampire novel in which the author not only uses few stereotypical vampire features, but creates her own. The ideas she chose to use for the vampires in this story are quite original and actually work well. Also, it's a good way to slip in some history while enjoying the romantic ride. Overall this book kept me reading and made me want more. Congratz :) I give it a 5/5.

159448385X|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns By Khaled Hosseini  '' A thematic journey through Historic Afghanistan''- critics Weekly     A. Author's main thesis / Argument & Plot summary.     The author Khaled Hosseini is trying to convey the struggle of two Afghani women : Mariam and Laila, whose lives have both been stricken by misfortune during a time of political turmoil in the middle east spanning over thirty years from nineteen seventy four to about two thousand and five .     The story starts out with a young girl Mariam jo. Who has been born to a mother of Hazara decent . For those of us who do not have even the slightest clue what a Hazara is it's someone of the lower social class. Now Mariam's father Baba is a rich man who doesn't show any true love for his hazara daughter in fear of a poor reputation. The story Starts out around Mariam's fifteenth birthday (1974), now at the same time in reality roughly 1973 Mohammed Daud seizes power in a coup and declares a republic , he tries to play off the USSR ( former soviet union ) against the western powers. This is accurately depicted in the book as Britain and the Soviet Union are scrambling for the control of Afghanistan. Soon after Mariam's fifteenth birthday on a regular visitation day her father does not show up and so Mariam goes off curiously to find him at his estate in the bustling city of Herat.   In Herat she is turned away by her fathers ''family'', when his driver tells Mariam he is not home she stubbornly refuses and sleeps on the gates of his estate. The next day the driver forces her home but on the way home they find Mariam's mother Nana hanging by the end of a tree, Mariam had taken for granted her mothers warning '' if you go visit him it'll kill me.'' Mariam is shortly after forced to marry a crude man named Rasheed and leaves for the city of Kabul. As a wife she is nothing but numerous failures. Throughout the twenty-plus year span of her marriage she is brutally abused. Than part two begins of the book with a perspective change to a local neighbors daughter Laila aka ''revolutionary girl.''     Laila is a girl who has been orphaned by a stray rocket that hit her home in Kabul, killing her parents . She has a best friend Tariq at the moment whom she is pregnant with his baby . Laila marries Rasheed in order to save her baby , she thought of going after Tariq and had a nightmare of her blue baby in pakistan being lowered into the ground . Laila Soon to find out that she is bound for the same disastrous marriage as Mariam. Laila has the baby girl named Aziza but Rasheed becomes more irritable of this fact and begins abusing Laila as he does to Mariam until she delivers him a son . This man Rasheed had a son in his past marriage who had drowned decades before .     From there on the marriage spirals out of control , until the point where Mariam kills Rasheed,when Laila says Mariam come with us to Pakistan Mariam will not hear of it . She fears she can no longer look Zalmai Rasheed's son in the eyes and know she took his father . The book sums up with an Americanized ''Disney'' ending of Laila eventually going back to Kabul and fulfilling her dreams . She lives comfortably with Tariq , Aziza (her daughter ) and Zalmai ( her son).     B. The thesis the author is trying to point out is specifically : women's rights during a time of political turmoil in Afghanistan. That is strongly agreeable to me and especially in the society WE the people live in , '' the land of the free.'' Women were suppressed during the reign of the Taliban, they'd be beaten up and sent home for not wearing a burqa in public . They'd also be beaten and sent home if seen roaming the streets while not in the presence of a male family member. Discussing such matters are controversial especially to an islamic fundamentalist some of whom believe women do not even possess the custody of their children or the right to marry. Women didn't even have the right to run , Laila tried unsuccessfully.   The Following Evidence is from News.bbc.co.uk12/hi/1162108.3tm     C. 1996 - Taliban seize control of Kabul and introduce hard-line version of Islam, banning women from work , and introducing Islamic punishments which include stoning to death and amputations. Rabbani flees to join anti-Taliban northern alliance .     D. The main characters are Mariam and Laila who face supreme suppression of their rights , these characters according to factual evidence are an accurate representation of history because as a reader I know that Mariam and Lailas conflict is caused in part by the political turmoil discussed previously in letter C . In a Thousand Splendid Suns Laila was beaten and sent home by the Taliban for trying to visit her daughter at the orphanage , the reason for not being in the presence of a man in public . The Taliban denied women basic human rights declared in history by people like John Locke and the Universal Constitution of human rights . Some of these things are still happening today overseas according to Afghan's women's news troops overseas have only been able to push out the influence of the Taliban in cities , in the countryside areas are still affected and under the control of the Taliban. These women many of them still girls are vulnerable to the punishments and violence that Mariam and Laila faced.     E. Why did the author choose such an Americanized ending while the rest of the book was more detailed in the aspect of reality?     F Yes , I'd definitely recommend reading this book because it has a strong plot that's been intertwined with history in a region where on the outside world we do not all know much about. The story is also a perspective changer because I who live in Astoria , Queens have scene a lot of recent Afghan arrivals and always thought of it as random , Well why are they coming here now? It's because some of them had been denied basic rights in their own countries . It shows that in another society , even modern day women do not have the privileges they should , that's especially alarming seeing the country that we currently live in .

As a teacher I used this book for many years ( the discovery of sex had to be glossed over of course) to take both young men and women on the journey to find out who they were and what maybe they would like to be given the strictures of parental morality and public school dishonesty.<br /><br />This book I sent as a gift to someone who has taken many journeys, none of which led to that `ah ha` moment. They feel as if there is no tomorrow, and no more inviting pathways. The person is in their mid-40s. I am hoping that Mr. Hesse's short novel can rekindle in this person the curiosity they once had about their unfolding world, and hope that through Siddartha that they can rekindle the hope required to take on a new difficult road with an open mind ready to take in new possibilities.<br /><br />Dr. Tim Scully
1410430103|5.0|How would you feel if you killed your own brother? Jack Reacher accidentally did it.    I have read , at least, ten Reacher novels.  Each one I read I say is the best.    [[AS IN:B002G7UKBO Killing Floor [KILLING FLOOR] [Kindle]]] may very well be THE best one.  It is a page turner.    Reacher is an eccentric.  It doesn't live anywhere nor does he own anything, except a toothbrush. He wanders from place to place. Author, Lee Child is a chnap at description.  The readers feels the cold or the heat, No matter where  Reacher winds up, he walks into a murderous situation.  At no time is it killing for the sake of killing; the plot requires the murders. From the beginning, all is unexpected. I have never guessed an ending.    If you want to spend a couple of days in an imaginary, corrupt place, read Killing Floor. Killing Floor is entertaining and, also, a psychological challenge.  Reading Killing Floor is not a waste of the reader's time.      So far, I haven't even found a grammar error or a typo.

0199538115|4.0|I don't know why I'm so often surprised at how good a \\"classic\\" novel can be, but I very much enjoyed re-reading Little Women this week. As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated,  intrigued and charmed.  Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice.  In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too.  I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time.  There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\"  This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style.

B000ZELISO|1.0|Wow, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the blu-ray experience, totally sucked.  After fast-forwarding through the Wizard of Oz advertainment (nothing against TWOO, mind you) four times, no combination of 'maximum Experience' options would actually play the movie w/o Rupert Grint popping in<br />, picture-in-picture, followed shortly by special effects options and a special section from the director about the Millenium Bridge.  This is fine on a rainy Saturday afternoon when I've seen it 6 times already, but I really miss just inserting the disc and watching the movie.<br /><br />AARGH!<br /><br />This is only the 2-disc edition; perhaps if I'd sprung for the 3-disc edition there'd be one disc that just worked.<br /><br />(If you were hoping for a movie review, I apologize; when I get one that actually plays the movie w/o the bonus distraction layer, I'll try to come up with something.)

0670022411|3.0|The concepts behind A Discovery of Witches are not new by any means. The execution of this concept was fairly well done, though the writing style of the author often slipped into the 'romance novel' type of character development that I found completely at odds with the story needs. I often found this language pulled me out of the story though the engaging plot always pulled me back in. I'd rate this as 3 1/2 stars if that option was available. I'll definitely read another book in the series if such is published just to see what happens next.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|To say the same as many others, this headset is just not worth the price for the simple fact that you get so much interference that manifests itself in very abrupt \\"popping.\\"    It was very difficult to get the volume at a high enough level where it was comfortable, but the sound in-game is great especially for picking up those illusive sounds that you just can't get over other cheap headsets, but still the popping comes in and that just silly when your supposed to have a top dog headset.  The quality of the materials is ok, just not the price that is asked \\"ok.\\" Anything this expensive should be bronzed.    If you're really going to spend over $100 for a headset then be ready to jump to the $200 level because everything in between, Ear Force or otherwise, if you read the reviews, is not worth it.    I returned this head-set after the first day.    If you're like me and you need wireless because your office has enough cords already then consider going a step up and just get the PX5's for about another $50.

B000002L42|4.0|This is obviously a live CD taken from several concert dates in 1994.  It is a typical product of the mid 1990s, and somewhat of a disappointment, but still enjoyable.    -The sound quality good but not great.  It is typical of releases in the mid 1990s.  It is not as bad as the early CDs that were released in the 1980s, but not as good as those released in the new century.  This is surprising and disappointing coming from a group like Steely Dan that prided itself in the sonic quality of its studio recordings.  By the mid 1990s, there started to be some really good sounding CDs and that is what you would expect from Steely Dan.  In addition, there was some \\"fixing\\" of the tapes in the studio...you would think they would have sounded better.    -This is a one CD album and 66 minutes long.  This was pretty much the trend in the 1990s, to release a single CD live album.  There was something negative about a 2 CD set and everyone tried to cram everything on to a single CD.  (Maybe it came from the early days when the production of a CD was fairly expensive and a double CD had to cost more.  But, by the mid 1990s, the cost of CD production had come way down).  You know that they played longer than 66 minutes during this tour.    -While I like that the songs are not performed the way they are on the studio albums, I don't think the performances of all of the songs are that great.  They seem a little dead to me.  And there is almost no emotion in the lead vocals.  The words are almost spoken in parts.    So, nice, entertaining album, but not that great.  In some cases the studio versions have more energy and are much better than the live versions.
0756404738|4.0|The wise mans fear..  [[ASIN:0756404738 The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 2)]]    This books is the second book in the kingkiller Chronicles, and if you haven't read the first book, then stop here and read the first one. -->[[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]]  I'm not saying that you cant read this book alone, but there are VITAL points in the book that you just wouldn't get otherwise.     The book takes us right into the story where we left off the last time, within a few pages you are almost consumed by the book and you have the same feeling you had in the first book. Patrick Rothfuss takes what he created in the first book turns it back and makes it even greater, we go deeper into Kvothe's life, why he becomes what he is, how he developes, his love, his losses, and his achivements.     What we were given a small taste of in book one(and yes it was small compared to what we get now.), he makes larger and expands his universe beond our imagenation and takes us back to what we know.    Kvothe and Denna have thier ups and downs, we hear about them all and how their lifes are bound in remarkeble ways, and ofcourse they meet in the most unlikely of all places.    I won't give this book 5 stars since this is my first real review, but it is a 4,5 though. It gives you excitement, chills, tears and drama. I enjoyed this book alot, infact I missed my college class' for two days because I couldn't leave this book.    I hope you decide to read it, because it is well worth the time. Again, read book one first as you will miss out on many good jokes and plots if you haven't.    // Pawiie
B0034G4OY0|5.0|I think the negative reviews have a lot to do with the trailer that shows part of the opening action scene. I guess a lot of people thought that this was some sort of action or disaster flick. It's a Clint Eastwood film and if you like his films you'll like this one. It's also unfortunate that we have become so used to films moving along at a fast pace. Many of the great films were made by directors like Eastwood who took their time and let the story develop at a natural pace. This way you get to feel the impact of the story, and also you care for the characters. Many of today's films are poorly edited and have no flow, they jump from one scene to another too quickly. There are several amazing scenes in this film, including the opening scene, the romantic feeding scene, and others. The film has depth and comes together beautifully at the end as the characters lives cross. This is one of those films that is under appreciated now but I expect will gain stature over time, as many great films did.<br /><br />I just watched this again, February 10, 2013. It was almost as good as the first time. The bad reviews are mostly from people who like action flicks that move along at a frantic pace and make no sense. This is really a remarkable movie that I expect will have an emotional impact on some people.

630469654X|4.0|The musical score which later approaches perfection in its subtle support of action, dialogue and scenery is at first an equally glaring, overstated distraction that mars the opening credits of \\"Ladyhawke\\" and for bad measure rears up again during the end credits. Setting this point aside for the moment, to watch Goliath's strut and hear Gaston's humorous asides to God are both well worth the research time involved in and price of finding this beautiful but now-disappearing movie. While cementing Rutger Hauer's royal stature in science fiction circles, the film includes additional performances of conviction from Matthew Broderick, Leo McKern, Alfred Molina (yes, he of much later \\"Spider Man 2\\" infamy), Michelle Pfeiffer and John Wood. It is Wood - and to an extent lessened only by his minor role, Molina - that reminds us how to best play a villain: strike fear in the best intentioned heart not by brute posturing or aimless rants, but with steady movements, even steadier gazes and a powerful voice delivering crisp words adrip with sinister intent. (Other great examples: Darth Vader and The Emperor throughout the \\"Star Wars\\" saga, & Jacob Kell in \\"Highlander: Endgame.\\") Consider how differently the male characters each utter just the name \\"Isabeau\\" at various points in this story to see, hear and best of all feel what they mean by so doing. The problems keeping \\"Ladyhawke\\" from five-star territory (a grainy DVD transfer, lack of audio commentaries and interviews, and the aforementioned score) beg to be resolved by a deluxe treatment similar to that given its equally excellent and similarly soundtrack-challenged 1985 sibling-in-fantasy, Ridley Scott's \\"Legend.\\" Become \\"lost in it, with the rest of us.\\"
0812973992|5.0|How do you eulogize the World Trade Center towers without the overpowering connotations of 9/11 drowning everything else that may be said?  For who - at least in New York City - doesn't have particular memories or personally know someone who either died there or was one of its lucky survivors?    Yet they remain such a icon to that day of horror.  They deserve to have better times re-associated with them.  Author Colum McCann thought so too, and set about writing a masterpiece with a dozen voices and a cross-section of people of New York City when those towering skyscrapers were quietly providing visitors and office workers an overview to the city's angst and bustle below.    McCann uses the unexpected and thrilling tightrope walk of Philippe Petit who on a summer's day in 1974 walked, ran, and did acrobatics for a generous amount of time while spectators watched breathlessly below and policemen did - what could they do? watched and cajoled him to come in from the towers' windows on both sides.  And he did - when he was ready.    The tightrope walk becomes a loosely connecting event for the vibrant characters in this novel, characters which include prostitutes, pimps, clergy, phone hackers, artists, judges, nurses and a support group of grieving mothers of fallen Vietnam vets, from Park Avenue to those that live along the Bronx' Deegan Expressway;  grief is a central theme of this book - a couple main characters are killed in a vehicle crash early on - the collective grief a shadow for the looming end day of the towers.  McCann shows us the city's un-pretty underside, the cynicism of over-worked and falling apart institutions and people who fight back and make do.  At the same time he shows those making sacrifices and stretching their souls and learning that doing the right thing has its own merits.     This is about (as McCann said in the book's notes):  \\"the ordinary people on the street, the ones who walked a tightrope just one inch off the ground.\\"    As I was reading this remarkable book I couldn't help drawing parallels with another book about a different city, Dublin, centered around a single day decades ago - Joyce's Ulysses.  Although McCann's Let the Great World Spin pivots around the tightrope day, it covers more time, and yet our author for me has caught his respective city's life - its vibrancy - with greater poignancy and clarity than the famed earlier author.    Life goes on.  Even without the towers.  We can re-joice.

B001LYD2K4|5.0|A stirring snapshot of a mercurial guitarist at the peak of his craft, Michael Schenker's second solo album (imaginatively entitled MSG) is an enduring and inspired affair. Hard-rocking and infused with a melodious spirit that should have been bottled, this 1981 release is a bonafide classic and one which resides at the very top of Schenker's impressive solo-catalog.     Joining Herr Schenker on this, his second foray as bandleader, is an all-star line-up featuring some of the era's more notorious heavy-hitters: Returning vocalist Gary Barden, bassist Chris Glen, ex-UFO chum Paul Raymond on keyboards/rhythm guitar and drum powerhouse Cozy Powell. Schenker and company would convene in the Bahamas with producer Ron Nevison to track the sessions which would become one of the most beloved albums of Schenker's post-UFO career. Recording in the tropics with it's cool winds and sands drenched-in-moonlight beget an artistic elixir for the the fearsome-five and saw them emerge from the studio with eight tracks of pure hard-rock dynamite.     The one-two punch of album openers \\"Are You Ready To Rock\\" and \\"Attack Of The Mad Axeman\\" are staggering statements of intent. Both cuts are assured and possessed by killer riffs with \\"Rock\\" kicking things off in spectacular fashion. A vintage Schenker riff rallys the metal faithful with a call-to-arms atop the surging back of Cozy Powell's authoritative drums, whilst Gary Barden intones the lyric \\"out in the streets/the kids stand and wait their time\\" with a frosty bite.     Schenker swings for the fences with \\"Mad Axeman\\" and simultaneously creates an anthemic and timeless track for the ages. A disturbing - albeit playful - nod about a killer loose on the streets, Schenker detonates an explosive riff at the outset of this mid-tempo rocker and weaves and bobs alongside a seductively propulsive rhythm section. Powell's militaristic drumbeats are the perfect foil to Schenkers infectious licks which reach a feverish pitch come solo-time when Schenker attains warp-drive and LAUNCHES into a solo that has to be heard to be believed. \\"Mad Axeman's\\" outro-solo is imbued with a melodic confidence and spontaneity that reaches rarefied heights of genius as it hurls towards the finish line with a barrage of fleet-fingered histrionics and lightning-fast runs. Schenker is in full Guitar-God mode here and delivers with an uncanny, almost UNEARTHLY performance. Absolutely incredible stuff!      Paul Raymond's haunting keys unlock the mystery that is \\"On And On,\\" another riff-heavy track that benefits from an amazing Barden vocal. This is vinatge MSG and the vocal/keyboard hook at the song's chorus is arranged perfectly so that it gives way to yet another fierce Schenker solo as he rips and tears like a hungry wolf at his Flying V with unmatched virtuosity. A killer track and one that remains a staple of Schenker's set-list some 30-years on (and on). \\"Let Sleeping Dogs Lie\\" is cut from the same cloth as 'Axeman\\" and closes side one in appropriate fashion.     Side Two opens with the majestic and grandiose \\"But I Want More,\\" an epic track with multiple layers and moods. An hypnotic keyboard intro sets the stage for Schenker and company to create this album's \\"Lost Horizons.\\" Cozy's double-bass fills and the sharp-snap of his snare contribute mightily to the power of this track as does Schenker's intricate, spellbinding riffing. The Paul Raymond-penned semi-ballad \\"Never Trust A Stranger,\\" rests comfortably here and affords the guys an opportunity to slow things down a bit. A woeful Barden reminisces about \\"conversations that get him down\\" and \\"times and places not long ago\\" as the band percolates just beneath him with a soft, romantic swing.     Business picks-up significantly with the superlative \\"Looking For Love,\\" a rousing, driving Schenker tour-de-force. Schenker is front-and-center and lays down a PHENOMENAL performance here with a melodic-gem of a tune. His guitar buzzes with a VICIOUS snarl at the song's start followed closely by a Cozy Powell drum-eruption  which sends the song into hyper-space. Raymond's glorious synth-line fights the good fight and manages to co-exist with the HEAVY guitars but concedes the battle at the solo. Undoudtedly one of Schenker's finest moments ever, the \\"Love\\" solo is enveloped by an intangible element which sees him magically snatching melodic notes out of thin-air to contruct an awe-inspiring piece of mellifluous magnificence. Set-closer \\"Secondary Motion\\" barely has a chance to succeed on it's own merits following so closely after the clinic which came just before. Despite this handicap, it is able to end the set on a high-note and it bode well for the group's future.     Released at the outset of a new decade, Michael Schenker's MSG was a bold, artistic triumph for the controversial guitarist. Armed and ready with a somewhat stable line-up and an aresenal of terrific songs, the stage was set for MSG to ascend to new, dizzying heights in the metal world. Unfortunately, fate is a cruel jester and this was not meant to be. - Ronnie Jimenez
B00007AJGH|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" (hereafter WFRR) is an exhilarating example of a \\"Hamlet Syndrome\\" movie. I define a \\"Hamlet Syndrome\\" work as one that is so important, revolutionary, and/or complex that it has been endlessly analyzed from multiple perspectives, and therefore impossible to make an original comment upon. In other words, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? For example, I'm sure I'm not the only poster who has seen this movie multiple times in the theater (5 times in my case). Also, many posters must own the VHS or DVD version; in fact, WFRR was my first VHS movie purchase and someday I will purchase the DVD. Like many posters, I adore the masterful, seamless, phantasmagoric merger of live action and animation. Sigh! I think I'll comment upon the main factor that, in my opinion, made WFRR such a success - its matter-of-fact, focused intelligence.<br /><br />It seems strange to call the anarchic, partly animated WFRR world focused and intelligent, but it is. The dialogue is whip-smart, sizzling, and meaningful at every moment, even when a toon is speaking it. The development of the murder mystery involving the death of Acme Products's practical joker king Marvin Acme is appropriately convoluted, twisty, and elusive. The detective Eddie Valiant is still street-smart, shrewd, and clever despite his descent into alcoholism and despair over the murder of his brother (poignantly summarized by a photo montage). Likewise, his transition from enjoying to hating toons because his brother was killed by one. The implication of the goofy Roger Rabbit in Acme's murder because of his supposed dalliance with his stunning human toon wife Jessica Rabbit. The stubbornly growing relationship between Roger and his reluctant protector Eddie. The sinister machinations of the cadaverous Judge Doom. Even the toons' fantastic feats which as Roger explains can occur only if they are funny. Every aspect of the film impresses you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.<br /><br />WFRR is indeed intelligent, and its intelligence extends to pleasing both kids and adults without being condescending or boring to either. Almost inevitably, this means the movie presents risqu&eacute; dialogue and situations (e.g. Baby Herman's lament about his 40-year-old lust and his 3-year-old dinky, or Eddie's sometime girlfriend and speakeasy owner Delores commenting on the rabbit extending from his pocket). But the movie is agile and lighthearted enough to avoid offending anyone (unlike, say, Rango). The action, jokes, one-liners, and asides are all sharp and really require you to think.<br /><br />The entire tone of WFRR is smart, too, as well as underplayed and low-key. Even when someone acts crazy, as for example in the climax when Eddie attempts to save Roger and Jessica from being immersed in the \\"dip\\" by...I'm not telling, it has a serious objective. Humans interact with cartoons and sometimes even enter Toontown, the toons's abode, but they never BECOME cartoons. The tone bolsters the underlying serious themes of the movie, which are not only will Roger be acquitted, but also whether Eddie will redeem himself professionally and socially. WFRR will also teach you something about '40s film noir and detective movies, if you are observant.<br /><br />WFRR does something more. Its overall craft and brilliance affirms how great human beings can be, when they set their minds to something. Who would expect a collision of flesh-and-blood humans, irreverent Looney Tunes characters, and boisterous Disney characters to do that?you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.

1594202842|3.0|This book makes you think about what you want for and from your children, and how you are willing to achieve it. As much as any parent wants to push his or her child to a \\"better place in life,\\" it is important to see how the ends may not outweigh the means. Chua depicts how she, in traditional Chinese fashion, pushed her two daughters to be flawless in almost every aspect of their lives. The relentless Chua nearly destroys her relationship with one daughter because of her refusal to let her daughter be autonomous. Chua tries to make the story look like a learning experience, but to me she seemed almost oblivious to the harm she was inflicting upon her daughter. This is a good book for any parents who have high aspirations for their children because it will give you a chance to reflect on just how far you will be willing to push your children. The book is a quick read and good for reflection (not only about parenting, but also about human nature in general). If you are unsure whether you want to spend your money reading about Chua's psychotic quirks, borrow before you buy.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />The more I ponder Peter Jackson's re-interpretation of the classic 1933 movie \\"King Kong\\", the more convinced I become that he was at least subconsciously paralleling James Cameron's blockbuster \\"Titanic\\". Like Cameron, Jackson wanted to transcend the basic, naturalistic action and horror aspects of the tale and meticulously explore a relationship that will outlive death and fate. Consider the climax; the airplanes finally succeed in knocking Kong off his Empire State Building pedestal and almost over the edge. He is still clinging by his fingers. He exchanges one last lingering, emotional look with Ann Darrow, then finally lets go. He slowly plummets to the ground. It reminded me of Jack clinging to the driftwood in \\"Titanic\\", exchanging one last sorrowful look with Rose before letting go and plunging to the bottom of the Atlantic.<br /><br />However, the 2005 version of King Kong (hereafter KK2005) is not strictly a love story. There really isn't any romance, even between Ann and Jack. It is the story of a tortuous, danger-fraught, but ultimately enduring friendship between an unemployed actress and a dinosaur-sized ape. It may remind you a little of \\"Gorillas in the Mist\\", the movie about naturalist Dian Fossey's relationship with the endangered simians. The 3-hour movie running time may be annoying to some, and sometimes understandably so, but it is utterly necessary to explore the developing interaction between Ann and Kong, and to reveal that Kong is not a legendary demon, but a natural, sentient beast who is the last of his species. Besides, he is strictly a vegetarian (remember him munching on the bamboo?). Make no mistake, Ann certainly fears Kong at first, but her previous hard-scrabble life and talents give her the determination and moxie to take control of the situation. So much so that Kong is even perplexed by her and eventually leaves her, until the dangers of Skull Island, culminating in an attack by three (!) Tyrannosaurus Rexes reunite the duo and give Ann's champion quite a workout!<br /><br />The jungle battles Kong fights on Ann's behalf are more exciting than the perils Carl Denham, Jack Driscoll, and the Venture's sailors encounter on Skull Island because a relationship is at stake and you care about it. In contrast, as when Carl, Jack, and crew encounter the sauropod stampede, and the monstrous insects, spiders, and other arthropods, while as technically accomplished as the T-rex battles, I think the action actually becomes a little bit wearisome and dull because we are less interested in them. We appreciate the time Kong and Ann find to spend together on the island and despair when Carl and company finally chloroform and capture the rampaging ape for transport, and Ann futilely screams to leave him alone.<br /><br />In a departure from the original 1933 movie, and even in the 1976 movie, Ann is not present when Kong is shackled and on display in a New York theater. Protesting Kong's humiliating captivity, Ann instead returns to her acting company. Kong (comically) winces at the phony actress tied up in front of him in a parody of the Skull Island sacrifice of Ann. But of course nothing can sever their friendship; again, Kong breaks free, causes considerable property damage, and somehow (how, exactly?) reunites with Ann. Despite the rampage, I think you feel sorry for Kong, cast loose and alone in a terrifying and wintry neon civilization with only Ann to which to turn. Together again, they manage to enjoy a Central Park interlude and even a sunrise view from the Empire State Building before the military and the biplanes cruelly shatter the magic.<br /><br />Again, many viewers felt KK2005's length hamstrung the movie. I disagree; it gave the movie breathing room to not only develop a deep friendship, but also a rousing exotic adventure, a conservation-minded treatise, some natural horror, a Depression-era time capsule, and the fleshing-out of an archetype. To get the most out of this movie, give it time to let it carry you away and console you with the fact that in spite of everything, Kong and Ann will always have Skull Island and New York.<br /><br />Now for some random (and fanciful) observations:<br /><br />1. The sauropods that Carl and company encounter and eventually cause to stampede do not look like Brontosaurs (Apatosaurs). They look like Camarasaurs with the boxy, deep heads. It was a shame to see such a magnificent herd hurdle off the cliff. By the way, being in the middle of that stampede, it was a miracle none of Denham's party gets trampled.<br /><br />2. As other posters as noted, the rough, brutal way Kong handles Ann as he crashes and fights his way through the island should have turned her into a shapeless mass of protoplasm.<br /><br />3. Again, we have the $64,000 question: after chloroforming Kong, how did Carl and company float Kong to the ship and transport him thousands of miles to New York? I don't think Kong could even fit on or in the ship. Only the 1976 version of King Kong answers that question by hauling him in a colossal oil tanker.<br /><br />4. The Central Park sequence where he plays on the ice pond with Ann is beguiling but doesn't make much sense. Unless the pond were frozen all the way to the bottom, wouldn't Kong's estimated 20 tons have broken through? Also, as a tropical animal, wouldn't the New York winter have been uncomfortable, in spite of his fur?<br /><br />5. If Jackson really wanted to do a homage of \\"Titanic\\", he should have begun his picture in the present day. For example, he could have had a road crew discover a mysterious, giant skeleton while digging up a street. Archeologists and scientists are baffled, until an aged Ann Darrow arrives and identifies the skeleton as Kong. Then, with tears in her eyes, she begins her sad tale.<br /><br />6. Now that Skull Island is no longer a myth, Carl Denham could have recouped his losses by developing a wildlife park (oh, wait, that's Jurassic Park!).ype. To get the most out of this movie, give it time to let it carry you away and console you with the fact that in spite of everything, Kong and Ann will always have Skull Island and New York.<br /><br />Now for some random (and fanciful) observations:<br /><br />1.

It was a shame to see such a magnificent herd hurdle off the cliff. By the way, being in the middle of that stampede, it was a miracle none of Denham's party gets trampled.<br /><br />2. As other posters as noted, the rough, brutal way Kong handles Ann as he crashes and fights his way through the island should have turned her into a shapeless mass of protoplasm.<br /><br />3. Again, we have the $64,000 question: after chloroforming Kong, how did Carl and company float Kong to the ship and transport him thousands of miles to New York? I don't think Kong could even fit on or in the ship. Only the 1976 version of King Kong answers that question by hauling him in a colossal oil tanker.<br /><br />4. The Central Park sequence where he plays on the ice pond with Ann is beguiling but doesn't make much sense. Unless the pond were frozen all the way to the bottom, wouldn't Kong's estimated 20 tons have broken through? Also, as a tropical animal, wouldn't the New York winter have been uncomfortable, in spite of his fur?<br /><br />5. If Jackson really wanted to do a homage of \\"Titanic\\", he should have begun his picture in the present day. For example, he could have had a road crew discover a mysterious, giant skeleton while digging up a street. Archeologists and scientists are baffled, until an aged Ann Darrow arrives and identifies the skeleton as Kong. Then, with tears in her eyes, she begins her sad tale.<br /><br />6. Now that Skull Island is no longer a myth, Carl Denham could have recouped his losses by developing a wildlife park (oh,wait, that's Jurassic Park!).
0545265355|5.0|I haven't read yet the books, but I'm glad the delivery was ok. I was worried, since I'm from Argentina, and I had to wait 5 weeks until I received the package. But it arrived in perfect conditions. :)
B004NSULHM|1.0|Even within the broad confines of the Progressive rock gamut, this work is some strange stuff. Not sure if the work itself or the group that brought it to market is more of it's peculiar.<br />Lets be honest please.I would love to know how many times the 5 star raters are going to really listen to this completely bizarre experiment in sounds. It is an experiment in listening just to make it through this, whatever it is. This work ,or unwork, is sooooo awkward that it may actually make allot of money because it is such a spectacle in bizarreness. Many people may want to just hear one of the strangest works ever. I suggest that you do buy it and listen, just so you can say you have been there.<br />I actually returned my open copy to the store shelf without even asking for a refund. It now sits in the radiohead section opened and ready for its next subject. Ha Ha ! Hot Potato !<br />This CD sounds like a bunch of people running around in a dark recording studio room and accidentally coming in contact with live instruments whilst recording is in progress and then mixed down backwards with some primal vocal noises inserted.<br />This could also be construed as a attempt at communicating with unknown life forms. Not sure which is worse, The King of Limbs or Peter Gabriels last debacle ?<br />Buying this CD is like getting the Old Maid Card!!!!
0545265355|5.0|The set came the day it said it would. =) it was a new product still in the wrapping...sweet, lol. im very happy they came, so how i dont have to go to the library, or borrow my friends books, now i have my own set. awesome price, awesome buy, just awesome. now i can read the 3rd book! yay!

0375842209|4.0|Through the eyes of Death, this book lets us experience what it was like to live in Germany during World War II. Although Death may seem like an unlikely narrator, he is the perfect voice to describe the events that are depicted in this book. It captivates you from beginning to end, and will have you turning the pages well into the night. Rarely does one come across a book that once you finish it, you want to go back to page one and read it all over again. The characters were so real and raw; you were instantly drawn to them. This book tugs at heartstrings and makes you laugh and smile and feel for the characters in the book. It truly is a remarkable read, and even though it might be classified as a young adult book, it deals with circumstances that are so real to us, that it really is fit for any age group. Markus Zusak writes in a distinctive style, with imagery so profound, and in a way that is so different from other books. It doesn't have much mystery, since Death is the narrator; along the way he tells you the ending of the book. But although the ending is not shrouded in mystery, it works for the flow of the book. This book will make you laugh and cry and sit in awe at the power of the words that are written. This book is explosive, much like the events that occur in it, and it will stay with you for a long time.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and super addicting! i like that u can unlock new blades and backgrounds, arcade mode is my fav!

0060723513|5.0|I think everyone should read this book & if I were wealthy, I'd buy it for everyone I know. I know there is controversy about this being a true story, or not. It doesn't really matter, since it's a great story & carries a message everyone should hear.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. Us this app while at work. I never get bore as to what is one the radio.
0894803123|5.0|Great read. I was expecting simple ice cream recipes however I learned a lot more. The simple to read book is packed with Ice-Cream theory, Ben and Jerry's story and a bunch of great recipes. They even provide recipes for their own best sellers. I have already made Cherry Garcia and I would say the recipe was easy and it came out just like as if I had bought it at the store.
B000WQW988|5.0|This is my favorite Nirvana performance. I've watched it at least 10 times already. Or I'll just throw it on to clean the house to. Every Nirvana fan should own this disc.
B000000OF6|5.0|I'd previously had these on tape & have since worn them out from repeated listenings.<br /><br />If you're a Queen fan or just someone looking to get into the band, this is a must have. It's got some of the best loved & well known songs, all of which make for wonderful listening. My personal favorite? Killer Queen. What makes this CD set even better is that there's a little informational booklet in here that gives a paragraph or two about the history of the song.<br /><br />The only downfall of the set is that you'll probably find yourself singing the songs out loud & potentially embarrassing yourself. (Especially if you sing like a dying crow like I do.)
0743437497|5.0|If you've seen Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of The Shining with Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall (and enjoyed it) you'll enjoy the book by Stephen King much more. Not only is the book more detailed (as most books are compared to their film adaptation counter parts), but also includes important plot events that Kubrick neglected to even include in the movie, for whatever reasons. The plot-twisting, shockingly terrifying parts of the story manipulate your mind into a questionable reality of terror. Read it and you won't regret it.
B004TANJG4|5.0|This album will remind you of why you loved Duran Duran in the first place.  Yes, it sounds like a follow-up to \\"Rio\\" (\\"Runway Runaway\\" sounds like it came right off that album), yet also contemporary.  Towards the end of the 80s, my interest in DD faded, and was happy for them when they had the big resurgence with their self-titled album (referred to as the Wedding Album).  I wasn't particularly interested in \\"Big Time\\", \\"Medazzaland\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Astronaut\\" or especially \\"Red Carpet Massacre.\\"  By this time, DD was pretty much off my radar.  But I saw the self-titled first single from their upcoming album was being given away as a free download, so I figured, \\"What the heck - it's free and these guys used to put out such great music.  If I don't like it, I'll just delete it.\\"    Turns out it was an awesome song!  I just didn't \\"like\\" it - I LOVED it.  I was very interested in hearing more, and was blown away when the nine track digital only release came out.  I couldn't wait for the full length album, and it is fantastic.  I love every track (though I have to be honest - I think the two mini orchestral \\"AYNIN reprises\\" are somewhat of a waste).  My favorites appear to also be the favorites among the fans - \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\", \\"Being Followed\\", \\"Girl Panic!\\" and \\"Before The Rain.\\"  Least favorite - \\"Safe (In The Heat Of The Moment).\\"  But as a whole package, it's a gem and I wouldn't remove anything.  If you haven't already, believe the hype with this album and pick it up.  Right now.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great updated version of the original Angry Birds on Android. I'll be looking forward to seeing more to come. Worth the 99 cents to be ad free.

B002VECM4A|1.0|the movie is embarassing - the book is better -gives explicit details of abuse and is degrading as well-i was never sexually abused but i have seen it done to many little girls in my family when i was a little boy and none never told and neither did i -not saying it is right but some stories are best not put in movies
1402210795|5.0|In my opinion, this book owes more to Oscar Wilde than Jane Austen.  It reminds me of \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\".  Anthony, Viscount Shearingham, known to his friends as Sherry, is refused by the Incomparable, Miss Milford, then reminded by his mother and uncle that he doesn't come into his inheiritance until he turns 25 or marries. Financially embarassed due to his wild lifestyle, in a fit of pique he vows to marry the first woman he meets.  That woman is Hero Wantage, at seventeen seven years Sherry\\"s junior, whom he has known since she was eight.  She is is about to be shipped off to be a governess by the unloving aunt who raised her.  Sherry sees their marriage as a win-win situation; Hero can avoid becoming a governess and see life beyond the countryside where she has been raised,  and Sherry can get hold of his inheiritance while continuing to live his life as he has been.  Hero is agreeable since she has had a crush on Sherry for as long as she can remember. What Sherry fails to realize is that Hero is totally unschooled in the ways of Society and innocently keeps commiting social faux paux's.  He has to continually has to come to her rescue,  with the aid of Gil and Ferdy, his best friend and cousin respectively.  I love Gil and Ferdy, two men not blessed with an abundance of brain power, but who make up for it with their big hearts.  And Gil turns out to be something of a dark horse, coming up with a solution when things go awry that makes for happy endings all around.  Lord Wrotham and Miss Milford, who in a more conventional romance would be the principles,  are here relagated to supporting characters.  The story is a delightful bit of fluff that will have you smiling from beginning to end.
B003UESJF6|1.0|Very funny movie until the end when the villain make comments about there being no Easter bunny and Santa.  No reason for this in a kids movie and I would highly recommend avoiding this movie for this reason.  We buy most kids movies and I was disappointed that the writers in this movie had to ruin it.
B003ZHVJFA|3.0|Tekken is a great franchise. The plot is typical movie fair that deviates from the game. The use of some characters like Christie,Kazuya, Nina, Anna, and Eddie Gordo are ridiculous. The costume designs and acting are fairly decent, the actions scenes are a mixed bag of good and you've got to be kidding me.  The story focuses too much on Jin and that is the main flaw. (When did Jin become the main hero???) Jin does not enter the Tekken until the third game. The story feels rushed and while the costume designs and some fights are spot on the movie never really feels like Tekken. It's an enjoyable Martial Arts movie that would have been better served to be called King of Iron Fist as opposed to Tekken. Jin and Heihachi are done ok but the rest of the characters are not even close. This movie is on par with Street Fighter but doesn't even come close to the great first Mortal Kombat movie. Hollywood has to find the perfect match between satisfying fans and making great film. With popular examples and epic fails they should have gotten this right. Decent movie worth a rental and if you are a collector buy it.
B003UESJF6|4.0|Being bad never looked so good. Megamind has the best showmanship out of todays villains. His presentaion is over the top awesome in everyway. **Spoilers w/ the death of Metro City's(or Metrocity) Metro Man there is noone to protect them from Megamind taking control. But although he has what he wanted things arent quite the same. He misses his battles w/ Metro Man + needs a new hero to battle w/. To add to matters Roxanne Ritchie(Tina Fey)is on the hunt to find Megamind's hideout. Megamind plans to make a new hero w/ Metro Man's abilitis but misses his mark when he hits Hal(Jonah Hill)instead. From there hilarity unsues. I'll let you see the funny for yourself. But believe me when I saw there will be laughter, lots of laughter. W/ the voice talents of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, David Cross + Brad Pitt this is a must. Although the lead characters are plenty funny + well voiced I loved David Cross as Minion the most. This is a comedy on par w/ Shrek in the way that the humor is also geared towards adults. But loses a star because I think it was a little more geared toward adults humor + story wise. Still give this a look see, you won't be disapponited.
1592402690|3.0|Previous reviewers here have said it well. The amount of information Emerick provides into the inner workings of these classic records and this monumental band is fascinating and worth the read. But the author himself comes off as petty and egotistical. Sometimes it's simply funny - like when he's describing Paul McCartney in glowing, heavenly terms, over and over. Until it turns obnoxious - like when he uses the term &#34;ham fisted&#34; for the 20th time to describe George Harrison's solos (of which any discerning music fan recognizes as masterpieces of economy and innovation). The implicit story that emerges is that, for some reason, Emerick seemed to think he should have been at the forefront of this band's attention while they were at work creating masterpieces in the studio. And when they didn't pay enough attention to him, or treat him as an equal or peer, he took it personally. The thing that is most offensive, even worse than his belittling of George Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Star's amazing individual musical abilities, is the way in which he tries to downplay the significance of George Martin. As an outsider with no intimate knowledge of who did what on these recordings, even I can plainly see the ignorance in that perspective and it just makes Emerick seem silly, not to mention vacant.  Emerick did a wonderful, wonderful job recording the band. That fact can't be over-stated (though he does try). Mostly it's just a bummer to see him tarnish his own legacy this way, painting himself as an innovative technician with the soul of a turd.  The Beatles and Martin don't need defending. The record speaks for itself, so to speak. Their recordings done without Emerick, such as Rubber Soul, sound equally gorgeous - they were an amazing band on record with or without him. Conversely, most people will agree the one record they made without George Martin (Let it Be) clearly suffered. Draw your own conclusions.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I'm not normally one to pay for my apps, but I get a great deal of use from Wolfram Alpha being in college, and this app definitely delivers.  It is very convenient on the go and is a great help in my engineering classes.
0307477479|4.0|This is not exactly a book to savor, but the first-, second-, and third-person narrators, skipping forward and backward in time, make this book something of a marvel, something to admire.  I have to say that the first chapter was a turnoff, though.  Sasha is a remorseless kleptomaniac who pilfers pieces of other people's lives, perhaps attempting to assemble one of her own.  She works as an assistant to Bennie, a record producer, whose story we hear next.  From there, we move on to Rhea, who was in Bennie's garage punk band, and then to Lou, Bennie's mentor, who takes some hangers-on and his children on a disastrous African safari.  Then we meet Scotty, another bandmate of Bennie's, who delivers him a dead fish as a gift, and I'm on board.  It's a daisy chain in which the link (not to be confused with the character Linc!)that carries forward to the next chapter is always a surprise, right down to the 75-page Powerpoint presentation, which is itself a daisy chain of arrows, flowcharts, pyramids, equations, and bullet points.  As has-been rocker Bosco says, \\"Time is a goon,\\" and we can't predict who is going to come out ahead and who is going to be sapped by the goon.  I just read Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman, which, as you might guess, also focuses on time, and I'd be interested to know if Egan has some interest or experience in physics.  In fact, in Goon Squad, Jules Jones, a former celebrity reporter in jail, footnotes the account of his ill-fated interview with a starlet with comments about particle entanglement, a spooky property of photons that seems to parallel the manner in which the characters go their separate ways and then accordion back together or form a closed loop to one another.  Last but not least, there's the obsession of a child with the pauses in music that make you think the song is over when it's really not.  Perhaps these pauses are a metaphor for the spans of time in these characters' lives in which they seem to have lost their way and then manage to scramble back for at least one more stanza.    Here's my daisy chain.  The title of this book makes me think of the TV show The Mod Squad.  It had a character named Linc, and so does this book.  The TV show also starred Peggy Lipton, who lived for a time with record producer Lou Adler.  This book has a record producer named Lou.  Go figure.

0316069485|4.0|Michael Connelly has become my go-to author whenever gearing up for a vacation or business trip, and my most recent encounter didn't disappoint. The Reversal brings together defense attorney Mickey Haller and detective Harry Bosch to tackle a crime committed more than two decades prior. Throw in a vicious suspected killer who is out on bail while Haller and his team attempt to piece together the fading details of a heinous murder, and I guarantee you'll be riveted for the duration.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I read ALOT! I have not read an excellent book since Acheron by Sherrilyn Kenyon. This one was awesome! A completely new take on witches and vampires!
B00466HN6S|1.0|I took my grandkids, ages 3 and 5.  They see a lot of movies like this.  We were all disappointed.  The three year old kept telling me the movie would have a good part soon.  They liked the pink ninja bunnies and that was it for the entire movie.  I didn't give them my opinion in case they were enjoying the film, but they weren't and I thought it was lackluster and sadly silly.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Great album overall. Foo Fighters have comprised a number of hits into this 11 track CD. My favorites include Bridge Burning, Rope, These Days, and I should have known. Glad that one of rocks finest bands can still put together such a great album.
0470913029|2.0|I purchased this book thinking that I would really enjoy having a different approach to low carbs.  This book advises you to purchase high dollar foods.  I was not impressed with it.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|The books themselves are great and by that I mean the physical copy that is so much cheaper than the kindle version. I would gladly re-buy to have them electronically but not at this much of a mark up!
B004132I4S|3.0|i'm a fan of Sufjan, though i'm far from rabid (Illinois and Michigan are my predictable faves). i've only listened to this album twice so far, and all my really favorite albums take a while to grow on me... that said, i can usually detect the seed of a great (or at least what i would consider to be a great) album on the first listen.    i did not detect such a seed on this album, though it may in fact be buried behind or beneath the mind-bogglingly obtuse layers of (over)production. this album is so busy it makes his other albums seem downright ascetic.    don't get me wrong, i'll take chaotic noise over solo acoustic guitar and voice any day (though it must be admitted that Sufjan Stevens can pull off the occasional singer/songwriter ditty with greater elan than most full time singer-songwriter dittyists). as a basement studio multi-instrumentalist myself, i fully understand the desire to pile on more and more tracks, and god knows Sufjan has used this technique to great effect in the past (basically all the songs on Illinois and Michigan that weren't singer-songwriter ditties)... this time, however, i just wanted to be able to click the mute button on half the tracks so i could hear something other than a wall of homogenous noise.     the man's hugely talented and i'm sure there's plenty worth listening to, i'm just having a hard time hearing it... i WILL go back and give it a couple more tries... some day...
B0050PYNN0|4.0|This movie was exactly what I expected, and I was very entertained. There should be more of these types of movies that combine adult humor and the Medieval age together. This will be a cult classic years down the road. McBride and Franco are perfect together. Thadeous and Fabious are sons of the King. Fabious is brave and heroic, while Thadeous is a lazy slacker. On the day of Fabious and Belladonna's Wedding, an evil sorcerer named Leezar kidnaps her. The two brothers go on an epic journey to try and rescue her. Along the way, they'll have to deal with betrayal, nymphs, witches, beasts and more. If you want a silly comedy to watch with your friends, I highly recommend YOUR HIGHNESS!!!
0066620996|2.0|I found it to be like most business success books - some interesting concepts but relies on catch phrases and fortune cookie twists on common factors needed for success.  Take a look at the current state of the success stories and consider the explanations offered by the author in the book.  To me it's really a leadership/teamwork/inspirational book but there are bettter books out there for those topics.  Check it out for yourself.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|We all know that Britney Spears is not the strongest vocalist out there. But when she makes an album, she makes some great pop music. With Britney taking an hiatus from recording since her 2008 album, \\"Circus\\", it gave her time to learn what she truly wanted in her music. Personally, I love Britney's dance music. Although she can't dance the way she use too, her music is still amazing. The album opens with second single, \\"Till The World Ends\\", which is a fun, up-tempo, dance track that is great for the album opening. Then it picks up with first single, \\"Hold It Against Me\\". I loved this song when it first premiered and I will continue to love it. The beat is hot, her vocals are typical Britney, and the dubstep breakdown is my personal favorite from the song. A straight shooter. Britney did mention that she would have some \\"ballads\\" on the album but they would be up-tempo ballads. This comes in with, \\"Inside Out\\". A great track that has a hard knocking bass line. The dancing picks back up with, \\"I Wanna Go\\", the insanely different, yet clever, \\"How I Roll\\", and the party anthem, \\"Drop Dead (Beautiful)\\". \\"Seal It With A Kiss\\" is my Hold It Against Me Pt. 2. With a great beat, catchy melody, and another insane dubstep breakdown, it's a personal favorite of mine. The highlight of the album comes with, \\"Big Fat Bass\\", featuring will.i.am. Everything pop comes in on this record; a knocking bass line, catchy hook, and a great rhythm. Next we have my personal favorite, fun, \\"Trouble For Me\\", the Unusual You of the album, \\"Trip To Your Heart\\", the noticeable Dr. Luke produced, \\"Gasoline\\", and my least favorite, \\"Criminal\\". But with the deluxe, the fun doesn't stop there. It kicks in with the very catchy, \\"Up N' Down\\", one of Britney's best pop ballads, \\"He About To Lose Me\\", the Stargate produced, dance record, \\"Selfish\\", and another standout, pop/rock, \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\". Overall, Femme Fatale packs a punch in many ways, From dubstep, to pop, to catchy hooks, and amazing production, you can't go wrong with Britney this year.
1933492929|5.0|If you loved her work in the Star Wars book, this will be an even better treat for your eyes. She shows multiple styles, both real and cartoony, but with spunk and humor. She never ceases to be amazing. THIS truly is an artist to keep an eye on. Everything she illustrates comes truly alive. You can tell how a creature moves just by looking at her sketch. Her precision in anatomy even for imagines creatures is simply unmatched. I can't wait for more.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|This movie has the most mixed set of reviews of any that I can recall seeing. At one end of the spectrum are those who think this is a great movie and are impressed by the fact that it's about Greek mythology. At the other end are those who loved the book and can't get over the differences in the film version. Somewhere in between are the rest of us.    Dealing with the five-star reviews first- have you people seriously not seen any movies better than this one? It's an exciting enough adolescent caper, with state-of-the-art special effects (already, of course, outdated). The principal character is likeable, his sidekick is funny and the girl, who remains just a friend, is attractive. The three of them set out on a quest to save the world from evil. Now, let me think, has that idea ever been used before? I'll just repeat the name in case you missed it: Per-cy Jack-son. Does that happen to remind you of Har-ry Pot-ter, by any amazing coincidence? As for Greek mythology- this story tells you nothing about it except the names. The author, instead of calling the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, could have called them Larry, Moe and Curly and it wouldn't have made the story one jot less authentic. Indeed, he DOES call Medusa 'Auntie Em'; so much for Greek classicism. Take the movie for what it is, a rather derivative romp with no real substance, and enjoy it- but don't award it five stars.    As for the one-star crowd, why is it impossible for you to accept that a movie is not the same vehicle for a story as a book? If the director had tried to create a movie as faithful to the book as you would like (several people mentioned as one of their complaints that the character Annabeth has dark hair instead of blonde- is there no nit too small to pick?) the film would have been so long that everyone would have gone to sleep long before the intrepid trio got anywhere near the underworld. The test is not whether the movie is faithful to the book, but whether it works as amovie. Try to separate the two in your mind and you'll find you enjoy your evening a whole lot more than if you sit there muttering \\"That wasn't in the book.\\" By the way, I read the book before I saw the movie, so don't accuse me of not knowing how wonderful the book is (it isn't, but that's another story).    In short, those who opted for a star choice somewhere in the middle have got it right. The average review rating is three stars and that's exactly what this movie deserves. It's an enjoyable, light-hearted couple of hours, with a good director and a decent cast. It's not a classic and it's not a dud. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get to Auntie Em's before they close. I need a few more statues for the garden.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|May I dare say this is one of the best albums I own...    Kid Rock has gone through a very unique career.  I've never seen a mainstream artist's style of music change so slowly and drastically over time.  From \\"Devil Without a Cause\\" to \\"Born Free\\", you can tell he's inching, CD by CD, towards a sound that resembles some southern rock, some country, and a touch of blues.  With that change in genre style, he's also shown maturity.  You now hear words and phrases of wisdom instead of profanity.  Heart Ache, instead of promiscuity.  For me, listening to this album is a peaceful, relaxing experience.  Music couldn't be any more laid back, yet at the same time remaining upbeat, and giving you an urge to clap your hands along with it.  You can hear Kid Rock's free spirit attitude poor through his lyrics.  In that same regard, you can almost compare him to Lynyrd Skynyrd.  You get no sense of Kid Rock's popularity and wealth throughout the album.  He sings about life and relationships as if hes a normal, southern (even though hes from Michigan), lower class guy trying to live life.    I have been a fan of Kid Rock since \\"Devil Without a Cause\\".  My ears have evolved over the years to not only allow me to remain a fan, but to become an even bigger one.  With that said, I can understand fans or critics that have lost all interest in him.  After all, if someone is strictly a rap/rock fan then I can't blame them for losing interest.  There is no longer even a trace of that old style in this latest album.  Not even an 'F' Bomb.    I'm sure the younger generation is aware of this CD (and either loves or hates it), but for the slightly older folks, who don't know what \\"Devil Without a Cause\\" is, and you enjoy some country twang, or laid back southern rock and roll, I couldn't recommend this album more.
B003UESJF6|4.0|Seriously the designs of the main characters, far less merchandisable as those of Pixars, deterred me. Pushed by my wife and friends I watched it eventually and found it as hilarious as \\"Despicable Me\\" and \\"Cloudy with a chance of meatball\\". The plot, primarily for kids, is still okay for adults. Rent it, and give yourself a good laugh after a day's hard work. Recommended!
B00447L4KA|5.0|Love this movie.  I watch all the time when it comes on TV.  Decided I needed my own copy.  I'm a 70 year old who still likes these teenage movies.  This one is terrific and is based on Shakespeare's \\"Taming of the Shrew\\".
B0017R5UA0|4.0|Turntable used:  AT-LP120-USB with an AT120E stylus.<br /><br />I won't go into the music itself, as there are enough of those types of reviews.  This is my review of just the sound quality of the vinyl.  Bottom line: I have the CD and I have the vinyl, and the vinyl is superior.<br /><br />Reason is simple:  On some of the CD tracks, the loudness levels are such that you can actually hear some \\"fuzziness\\" on the louder parts -- for example, At around the 1 minute range on \\"Ragged Wood\\" on the CD, the loudness is so high that the dynamic range is affected.  However, that \\"fuzziness\\" does not exist on the vinyl - it's clearly noticeable in an A/B test.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you are looking for a best SQ for this album, imo you should get the vinyl.  There is definitely a difference between the two.<br /><br />I did chop off one star only because I have found spots on my vinyl where there seems to be defects in the sound, from time to time (some short \\"crackling\\") - I'm reasonably sure that it's the record and not my stylus or turntable.  Still, I will gladly take these small defects for the overall sound improvement.<br /><br />7/2011 EDIT:  I've since found a foorbar2000 plugin to check dynamic range, which confirms what my ears were hearing. The CD clocks in at a \\"7\\" (which is not very good), and the vinyl clocks in at \\"11\\" which is a significant improvement.
B004L79VUI|1.0|I am a contemporary of the 60's as well, but this stuff could put a rock to sleep...very slow, laid back, vocals almost whispered....does not rock at all; just sort of lays there and dies. Definitely not my cup of tea.

0756404738|5.0|The first book in the series was good. Damn good. So good, it almost seemed impossible to follow up. But, Rothfuss did it. This book is in every way as spectacular as the first, possibly even better. I can't wait for the third!
B004M20YDU|2.0|Part of the trouble with Daft Punk's soundtrack for TRON: Legacy is that it is so good, for one it catches the atmosphere of the film easily, and it can't be touched... plain and simple. It's just an absolute masterpiece in every sence of the word. Dark, thumping electro-classical with influences of John Carpenter and Vangelis. Totally earphone ready music, and Be it no surprise that the album has gotten heavy play value on my iPod. I was excited when I heard the French androids were doing the score, and I was totally satisfied when I heard it. Daft Punk, are IMO, the quintessential Electronica act, the only one I'll listen to because their music is so catchy and danceable.<br /><br />This reminded me of the horrid \\"Daft Club\\" remix album, where the songs were just wanked around with as opposed to remixed. OK, this is marginally more listenable than Daft Club, but it's still entirely forgettable.<br /><br />THE GOOD: Son of Flynn (KI Theory remix) rules. I love the pinch harmonics and the ooohing in the background, in fact, if anything, it should have been in the film. The Boyz Noise remix of End Of Line is a nice piece of Trance music that you could imagine being played loudly in Castor's club. Kaskade's \\"Rinzler\\" remix is surreal and dreamy... it's been on my mind a LOT lately. And The Crystal Method's remix of The Grid is seriously f'in' cool.<br /><br />THE BAD: PRetty much everything else. Problem is, I absolutely hate electronica music, detest remix albums, etc. I only like USS, Daft Punk, UNKLE, Oakenfold and a couple other laid-low acts- not that Deadmau5 or Tiesto garbage (although that \\"Elements of Life\\" song is cool). The artists on here have unfortunately taken Daft Punk's expensive jewel of a score and turned it into generic techno garbage you could hear at raves full of drugged out people where the music is so bad you can only enjoy it on drugs. For every good remix there's 3 bad ones, and I was honestly expecting a Deadmau5 remix on here since it was so generic.<br /><br />THE UNFORGIVABLE: That dreadful remix of \\"Fall\\". That NANANAAAAAAAAAAA vocal track is one of the most annoying things and gets in the way of pounding, suspenseful music. And the fact that they let Moby touch \\"The Son of Flynn\\".<br /><br />In short, I recommend you just stay away from this. Daft Punk can basically NOT be touched. Their music is simply too awesome for a remix, it's like covering a song by Iron Maiden, how it may seem good on paper but the original song is just too awesome to even be covered.RGIVABLE: That dreadful remix of \\"Fall\\".

B002ZNJWI6|5.0|Coming from someone who has not entirely happy with some of Reynolds other novels, I have to say House of Suns really delivers. Its a winner! This space saga spans exponentially long stretches of time and stretches across vast areas of the galaxy and beyond. Intrigue, well thought out plot twists, imaginative alien vistas and grand star-shaping technologies all put into a plausible framework built upon Reynold's background as a astro-physicist make for a completely satisfying tale. Some sci-fi authors create plots that meander in a random way with inadequate connection between the end and the beginning. That does NOT happen in House of Suns. The mysteries and characters created at the onset progress beautifully to an end that does not disappoint.
0684833395|5.0|What Joseph Heller accomplishes is nothing short of amazing. His use of language hooked me from the start. There were so many times where I just chuckled and others where I was sickened by the tragedy of war and how unfair it can be. It's a great exercise in literature.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a very long time. I would classify it as a cross between the DaVinci Code, Foucault's Pendulum , The Time Traveler's Wife, and any contemporary urban fantasy. Before I wrote this review, I read through other people's reviews, which frankly I'm glad I did not do before I read the book. While I usually cruise through books I love (don't do the laundry, make my kids make their own dinner) I actually found myself slowing my reading down with this book. I found the prose lyrical, and I wanted to savor it slowly. The plot pacing was slow at times, but that did not bother me at all. In fact, it made me slow down with it. One of the many criticisms that I read of this book, was that the relationship between Diana and Matthew was not consummated immediately. While I may have had a personal preference for reading about some hot sex, it actually fit the story being told to not have that happen.     As opposed to most urban fantasy these days, our heroine is not a kick-ass private detective. She cries alot, and doesn't know how to use her innate magic. She's a historian, and frankly acts like I think a historian would act. Her beau, Matthew is a 1500 vampire/warrior/scientist. He does act like a cave-vampire sometimes, but that is who he is. I loved the history, the science, and the vampire/witch lore woven into the story, and cannot wait for the sequel.

B004RL9T50|5.0|In my opinion this is Will Ferrels best movie yet, as a matter of fact it's the best movie I've seen in a long time.   If you like me and get tired of the the same cliche storylines and really get tired of watching animation because that is what your kids like, this movie will not disappoint. I started watching this movie with my son, with in the back of my mind \\"great another animation to annoy me for 90 minutes\\", but it didn't. It was fun and entertaining and I even forgot I was watching an animated movie. My son has watched it repeatedly since then and I havn't gotten tired of it. I even request it on occation.
0441013597|4.0|\\"Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece\\" adorns the cover of this edition, and it deserves it, ...kinda.  I've tried many times to read this over the years, but could never get past the first few pages. You are bombarded with so many weird names of things that it's easy to get overloaded, and put it down. But this time, I decided to power through that first chapter, and shortly thereafter I was hooked. I've never read such a good blend of story, science, and philosophy. With characters so layered, and plots so intertwined, it was seriously one of the best books I've ever read. But it didn't live up to itself. It felt like the author spent decades composing the first half of the book, making it perfect, and then rushed the last half to meet a deadline in a few months. I may not read it cover to cover again, but I will probably read the first part many times, and be quoting passages from it like sacred text.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Quite Simply the most gorgeous example of a cgi movie I've seen to date.  Alot of the scenes border on photo-realistic, possessing intricate detail.  The movements appear very natural, even when they make the owls talk.  The 3D is the best feature film I've seen so far as well, there are a few documentaries that capture a better 3D effect but not any movies.  There is one scene where they are flying in a rainstorm that will leave you breathless, it is absolutely stunning.  As for the story, it is a little dark but I found it quite enjoyable, and nothing I would tell a child they couldn't watch.  I only wish it was a longer film to give more time for developing the characters and story.  However I think they did a great job and look forward to the sequel which they left plenty of the story open to the point it would be tragic if there was no sequel.

B004LWZW24|4.0|The Review:<br /><br />From the makers of Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 comes a new horror movie, Insidous, starring Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne.  The Paranormal Activity people have not lost their touch and Insidious is an excellent example of how to make a scary movie without having to overly rely on creating a gorefest. Rather, Insidious opts for creating and sustaining tension, playing the audience masterfully.  You'll jump just when Insidious` creators want you to jump and you'll scream just when they want you to scream. Watch it in the right frame of mind and with a good audience and you'll be creeped out.<br /><br />As with Paranormal Activity, Insiduous takes the haunted house genre and combines it with the demon possessed child genre, a la Omen and the Exorcist. It throws in a pinch of A Nightmare on Elm Street and the result is something unique and extremely entertaining for devotees of the horror genre. It's clever and offers important new wrinkles for how our protagonists are supposed to deal with their situation.  One can move out of a haunted house, but one cannot easily move away from a haunted family member.<br /><br />Insidous centers around the Lambert Family: Josh, Renai, Dalton and Foster.  At first there's nothing about this family that marks them as abnormal, but as things progress it becomes clear that there is a very dark cloud hanging over them.  As with the folks in Paranormal Activity, the classic signs of a house haunting begin when the Lambert family moves into their new home.  Things move around, strange noises come out of the baby monitor and shadows seem to have a life of their own.  Mom, and the kids seem to notice these things first and Dad is determined to rationalize away these strange happenings.  Things progress to a point that even Josh cannot deny the evidence any longer.  Without giving too much away, there are indeed supernatural forces at play and they have not settled upon the Lambert clan by mere chance.<br /><br />Insidious succeeds because you are on the same journey of discovery as the Lambert family.  You learn alongside them answers to the question, why them? And the further you go, the more insidious their problems appear, hence the film's title.  Another winner from the makers of Paranormal Activity.  If you are easily creeped out, then think twice about this seeing this movie.  While nothing will ever creep me out as much the little girl from The Ring, Insidous left me leaving on an extra light or two around the apartment, and very thankful that I don't live in a creepy old house.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.the same journey of discovery as the Lambert family.

0689865384|5.0|A friend of mine is a 6th grade teacher who regularly reads YA fiction for ideas for the classroom.  She, and other teachers, all loved this book.  I was looking for something interesting, so I picked it up.  I've since read all four in the series and gave Uglies as a gift to my boyfriend's 12 year old daughter.  This past Christmas, she asked for the rest of the series, including Bogus to Bubbly.  I very much enjoyed these books, as each one has a differnet lesson to teach.  I was surprised at how invested I became in the lives of Tally and her friends and think that this book, and the rest of the series, are must reads for middle schoolers.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Maybe the words \\"raw\\" and \\"heavy\\" aren't the first adjectives that spring to mind when you think of Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, and yet, they've managed to pull off an album late into their career that falls into such categories. \\"Wasting Light,\\" the band's first full-length offering in nearly four years, finds the band re-uniting with original guitarist Pat Smear (who you may recall also toured with Nirvana) and joining forces with \\"[[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]]\\" producer Butch Vig to create a record that brings back the more stripped down and in-your-face vintage Foo Fighters (circa 1995) sound and serves to just about eclipse anything the band has done since the turn of the century. Yep, it's that good.<br /><br />From the opening staccato riff of \\"Burning Bridge,\\" it's clear that this is a different brand of Foo Fighters than radio has learned to love and play the heck out of during the past decade and a half; however that's not to say that Grohl's penchant for irresistible hooks and melodic muscle have been completely abandoned. True, nothing the likes of \\"Everlong\\" rears its head on the eleven blistering tracks that make up the album, but cuts like \\"These Days\\" and \\"I Should Have Known\\" (which happens to sport a guest spot by Grohl's former bandmate in Nirvana, Krist Novoselic on both accordion and bass) provide the moodier, more atmospheric contrasting moments to the album's otherwise reckless and ruthless rocking nature. Then of course you have cuts like \\"White Limo\\" which essentially provides the album's mission statement of creating no-holds barred and no-strings attached pure rock that serves as a throwback to a time long gone. And no one could do it better than these guys.<br /><br />Put simply, \\"Wasting Light\\" is the best Foo Fighters album in a good, long while. Old-school fans will be pleased at the return-to-form while newer fans will be shocked to hear the band punching out tunes that take a complete 180 from the likes of \\"Learn to Fly\\" and \\"Wheels.\\" With this album, the band sounds tighter than ever while Grohl has truly established himself as a rock hero no longer eclipsed by his time spent in that other band. \\"Wasting Light\\" simply rocks like no other and is most certainly not a waste of cash. Heck, fans who scoop up a copy of the initial pressing get an actual piece of the tape the band used to record the album. How's that for motivation to get your butt away from the computer and actually buy an album for once?album, the band sounds tighter than ever while Grohl has truly established himself as a rock hero no longer eclipsed by his time spent in that other band. \\"Wasting Light\\" simply rocks like no other and is most certainly not a waste of cash.

B004FQKY5Q|5.0|This album is awesome. I have to say I was bit disappointed with their last effort Room Service but this goes back to Roxette at their best probably with a kind of mixture of all the styles they have been good at over the years.  Here's my ratings:    Way Out: 10/10 I love this song its so catchy and a great way to start the album. Should be a single!    No One Makes It On Her Own: 10/10 I think this is a beautiful song with Marie back to her soulful beat and whats best its a song with real heart and depth, especially considering what she has been threough with the tumour. I really love this song. Its moving. A real classic.    She's Got Nothing On - I have to say this is a bit cheesey and seems like them trying to be modern. Its ok. I dont think its the best they have on offer though and dont know why its the single when there are other better songs.   7/10    Speak to Me - I like this one too 8/10. It has a bit of depth to it.     I'm Glad You Called - 9/10 Much nicer effort than some of the recent ballads on recent albums.     Only When I Dream - This reminds me of Abba Winner Takies It All. Its got a real Abba quality to it. Really Scandanavian feel. I like! 9/10    Dream On - 10/10 This is again one of my favourites on the album. Its different, catchy with a 60s vibe to it. I like it.     Big Black Cadillac - 6/10 This is a bit cheesey. I was never a big fan of Sleeping IN My Car. And this seems a bit too much of a take off of Pink Cadillac too.     In My Own Way - 10/10 nice epic ballad. This is what MArie is best at.     After All - I like this one too 10/10 Its real catchy. Real upbeat and a cool vibe. Really summery feel. Almost has a que Sera sera feel about it.     Happy On the Outside - 10/10 Moving lyrics. A song with a bit more depth again which is good to see.     Sitting On Top Of The World - 7/10 I dont like this so much as the other ballads on the album. Some of the lyrics are a bit banal. Particularly the \\"I like it\\".
0792844890|5.0|Despite it's having been around long before that time, I first saw this movie on the afternoon of my 21st birthday, courtesy of my sister. Being a fan of such crude films as Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, Holy Grail and Beavis and Butthead Do America, I quickly took to this movie. The story makes little to no sense but it's still funny as all get out.    The story of Spaceballs is simple in its way. The evil, imperious forces of Planet Spaceball, having foolishly squandered their entire planet's air supply in the matter of only a few decades, have set their sites on the shielded planet Druidia, where lie ten-thousand years of fresh, breatheable air. Unfortunately they must first open the combination locked air shield. To do this, the Spaceballs, in an operation spearheaded by the evil Dark Helmet (an obvious spoof on Dath Vader and about as whacky as Vader isn't), attempt to kidnap Druidia's only princess, Princess Vespa, who is engaged though unhappily to Prince Valium, the last prince left in the galaxy. In fact, she's just left her groom-to-be standing, or rather sleeping, at the altar as the Spaceballs begin to close in. In desperation, King ROland of Druidia calls on the services of freelancer Lone Star and his Mog sidekick Barf, the duo being a combination spoof of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo and Chewbacca. The duo arrives just ahead of the Spaceballs and, though they manage to spirit the haughty princess and her Droid of Honor Dot Matrix away, are forced by a lack of fuel to land on the desert planet Vega. Tracked to that locale by Helmet, the fugitives nonetheless make their way quite by accident to the lair of the all-powerful Yogurt, who instructs Lone Star in the use of the Schwartz, the greatest magic in the universe. This comes in quite handy, as during their stay Princess Vespa is lured away by Dark Helmet, another master of the Schwartz, and Lone Star and Barf must take off for Spaceball City to rescue her.    All in all this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in my entire life. And the added commentary by Mel Brooks only adds to the humor. And the fact that it parodies not merely Star Wars but the conventions of most if not all Scifi movies and fairytales and even current pop culture at that time as well is just another treat to add to the mix.
0399250573|4.0|I have to say that this series has been one of the best if not the best series I have ever read. Alex is portrayed so well that readers try to solve the problems he was faced with just like he would. I found myself so engrossed in the books that I would stay up late just to try and finish it before I would pass out from exhaustion. This book was great all though I do have one minor thing to point out that didn't go over to well with me. Alex using a real gun. Now don't get me wrong, I love stories with guns; but it seemed so out of place in the book. Now besides that, I think that the series was perfectly ended and that we can finally rest assured that Alex is safe.

0375826742|5.0|Now I have been reading this series when Eragon first came out on to bookshelves. This is an AMAZING series and deserves every award it gets. I love how well Eragon is portrayed and how well he is described; it makes you completely understand Eragon as a character. The thing that stands out to me the most is that Christopher touches every part of Eragon's world and adds color, detail, and most of all brings the story to life in the reader's head and lets the reader visit far off places and beautiful lands form the mind of the author. This is exactly what I think a book should be. Only one thing stood out to be in this book that I didn't like. Eragon just seems to be every lord's lave or servant. He is sent around just on errands for a while in the book. That aside though I thought that this book was beautifully written and greatly loved.
0385342039|4.0|If you've ever read Sophie Kinsella, then I don't need to tell you Twenties Girl is laugh out loud funny! This is a story of Lara Lington whose great-aunt Sadie, dead great-aunt Sadie, shows up to have Lara find her missing dragonfly necklace so she can rest in peace. Sadie appears as a twenty something year old sprit and throws Lara's already out of control life into a tailspin. Lara wants nothing more than to have her feisty fun loving spirited great-aunt leave her be! As Lara embarks on a quest for looking for a necklace, she ends up learning a lot about life and love from Sadie.<br /><br />  This book was so much fun to read. I loved both Lara and Sadie. Sadie at first seemed to be such a bother (though fun to read), but she really opened up Lara's eyes to seeing who she could be and to love life. Lara is even able to return the favor to Sadie as she stumbles upon the truth behind the darkest days of Sadie's youth. This is definite read.
B001DCQI9Q|4.0|The other reviewers are right, that there are some plodding moments in this set, especially among the minuets.   But there are also  some exhilirating moments which have occur when Karajan lets the reins go with his supervirtuosic orchestra.   Take the last few minutes of the finale to symphony #98.   Except for the overloud cheesy cembalo passage, the unison tutti passages  are simply exhilirating.   And this is true for most of the other unison tutti passages in the other fast movements.   I've heard many Haydn recordings, but to me it is the sheer exhiliration in the orchestral playing of these passages which distinguishes this set and makes it irreplaceable ...
B002SJIO4A|4.0|`District 9' was like that surprise hit of 2009, the film that no one expected to `go the distance', the one that racked up some surprising Oscar nominations (I think everyone expected that Visual Effects nomination, but Best Picture, Screenplay and Editing were pretty unexpected) and continued to astound critics and audiences alike.  I had been sitting on actually seeing this film for a while now, despite really wanting to see it.  I finally got around to seeing this the other night, and I must say that I approach this review with equal parts respect and bewilderment.<br /><br />The film is very good, but it misses greatness in my eyes.<br /><br />`District 9' references a slum that houses aliens that have landed in Johannesburg and have been populating the area for several decades.  Their mother-ship hovers ominously in the horizon, reminding the humans that the aliens are still there.  The humans have segregated the aliens, confining them to a small and disgusting area and have regarded them as nothing but trash, referring to them as `prawns'; a derogatory term used to label them bottom-feeders.  On the outset of the film we are told, in documentary form, that the aliens are about to be evicted and moved to another location.  Head of this particular assignment is Wikus Van De Merwe, a naïve and slightly odd young man whose father-in-law obviously favors him (but doesn't truly care for him).  While serving eviction notices and checking for illegal weapons, Wikus stumbles upon a device harvesting fluids that the aliens have been working on for twenty years.  That devise infects Wikus and soon he finds himself morphing into one of the aliens.  His department tries to use him as a test experiment and when he escapes they do what they can to track him down and cover up their own negligence.  Soon he is a fugitive with nowhere to turn but the one place he doesn't want to be a part of, District 9.<br /><br />The film is smarter than your average science fiction film in that it actually roots for a human core, something that can connect it to our world and speak to a deeper message.  In fact, it attains what it is searching for, especially on the surface.  `District 9' is absorbing and provocative, and that is a great asset to have within this genre, for it sets it apart and makes the audience take notice.  The action sequences are outstanding and the visual effects are tremendous (I prefer these authenticated visuals to `Avatar's cartoonesque appearance).  And yet, with such a sharply conceived idea (contrasting alien treatment with the apartheid) the film lacks the layers it needed to make this feel more human.  I'm tired of the whole idea that evil is one-note; that it is without levels of emotion.  In `District 9' it is apparent that humans are selfish and mean and aliens are misunderstood and kindhearted.  Even after being completely stepped on and stabbed in the back by a human, one of the aliens refuses to leave him alone in the sight of danger.<br /><br />`District 9' is far too black and white for its own good.<br /><br />Despite this flaw (ugh, why did it have to be there), this film is really well thought out and expertly crafted.  Director/writer Neill Blomkamp is one to watch for, since he really has a handle on this thing.  He has created a shockingly sincere and beautifully unique science fiction film that shows extreme promise for the young director (he's only six years older than me and look at where he is in his life!!!).for a human core, something that can connect it to our world and speak to a deeper message.

And yet, with such a sharply conceived idea (contrasting alien treatment with the apartheid) the film lacks the layers it needed to make this feel more human.  I'm tired of the whole idea that evil is one-note; that it is without levels of emotion.  In `District 9' it is apparent that humans are selfish and mean and aliens are misunderstood and kindhearted.  Even after being completely stepped on and stabbed in the back by a human, one of the aliens refuses to leave him alone in the sight of danger.      `District 9' is far too black and white for its own good.    Despite this flaw (ugh, why did it have to be there), this film is really well thought out and expertly crafted.  Director/writer Neill Blomkamp is one to watch for, since he really has a handle on this thing.  He has created a shockingly sincere and beautifully unique science fiction film that shows extreme promise for the young director (he's only six years older than me and look at where he is in his life!!!).

B0041KKYEM|4.0|Last year the world went kind of crazy for `Black Swan', the film that finally brought the world of Darren Aronofsky into the limelight for all to see.  Aronofsky has been creating quality and uniquely intriguing films since the late 90's, and he has brushed Oscar's hand before (garnering acting nominations for `Requiem for a Dream' and `The Wrestler') but it was the bizarrely obsessive `Black Swan' that finally garnered him an acting win (Natalie Portman) as well as Best Picture and Best Director nominations.  It surprises me that this film was `the one' since it is his most immature film to be quite honest.  That isn't to say that it isn't littered with wonderful treats, and Aronofsky's manic yet oddly controlled direction was most deserving of a nomination, but at the end of the day this film is middle-brow Aronofsky at best.<br /><br />I told a friend that this film was like a strange blend of `The Red Shoes' and `Carrie' (two masterpieces) directed by Lars von Trier (genius auteur) with a more polished production thanks to a larger budget.<br /><br />Yes, `Black Swan' is an ugly duckling.<br /><br />The film centers around a young ballerina named Nina who is desperately seeking perfection.  She wants the lead role in her company's revival of `Swan Lake' and she obsesses over the idea of being the Swan Queen, so much so that her whole world starts to take a dark tone.  She is virginal and innocent and childlike in many ways, and so she lacks the otherworldly knowledge to play the dual role part, but she is talented and thus believed in and so she is given the part.  Nina needs to break free from the constraints of her personality, but her upbringing (and her monstrously intrusive mother) makes it hard for her to `let go'.  Then Nina meets Lilly, a young ballerina, new to the company, who possesses everything that Nina lacks; namely sex appeal.  Nina becomes consumed with Lilly, mainly because she is afraid of her.  She begins to suspect that Lilly only wants to take away the lead role from her, and when Lilly is made her alternate she begins to lose her mind with fearful anxiety.<br /><br />`Black Swan' is a very blunt film that doesn't really know the word `restraint', which to be honest is part of the appeal.  The film doesn't hesitate to dive off the crazy train and make a free-fall for deeper waters, especially in the film's final act (which is a visceral work of genius).  The preposterous of the film is highlighted and embraced by Aronofsky's fearless direction, and so you have to appreciate that that is the impression he wanted to make.  Still, there is a feeling of cheapness that erodes some of my affection for the film.<br /><br />I also found that the film's ensemble was very lacking.  There are no layers to these characters.  They are mere caricatures, props for Aronofsky to toy with as he pleases.  I know that a lot of hoopla was made over Natalie Portman and her eventual Oscar win, but I honestly didn't find a lot of depth in her performance.  She was just crazy.  She never really got under the skin of Nina, uncovering who she really was.  Granted, the more I see and contemplate the film I gather that understanding the complexities of Nina wasn't really the point (this film is guilty pleasure personified) but a little depth explored would have fleshed her out and made her more understandable.  Barbara Hershey was also kind of one-note and clich&eacute;d, and not in the way that made her interesting.  Vincent Cassel was horrendous, his line readings were awkward and unbelievable.  In fact, as much as her awards attention baffled me, Mila Kunis was probably the best performance in the film; creating someone we were enthralled with and toying with Nina in a playfully seductive and mysterious manner.<br /><br />And yet still, the film is electrifying and unforgettable.  The cinematography, costume design, makeup, sound (OMG, the way you can hear every swipe of Nina's feet on the floor is to die for), editing and that beautifully haunting reworking of `Swan Lakes' score is just delicious to watch, and Darren Aronofsky knows exactly how to play the audience, drawing us in despite the film's apparent flaws.  This may be Darren's most immature film, but it's quite possibly his best directorial accomplishment.<br /><br />So in the end, I can't hate this film.  I don't understand the unabashed love for it, but I do understand the obsession over it.  It is a film about obsession that captivates its central core by defining obsession.  It oozes with charisma and sucks you in full throttle.core is just delicious to watch, and Darren Aronofsky knows exactly how to play the audience, drawing us in despite the film's apparent flaws.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|I am  tired of all the bashing that seems to be associated to this device...Here is the honest truth...I have owned the Frag FX v2 and i must admit that it still does a good job at playing games such as Killzone 2 and 3 and also MW2. I am sure that the Shark by Spitfish is also good but coming from a PC Gamer there is nothing like playing FPS games with Keyboard (Belkin Keypad) and mouse. I swear, all the people who are knocking this has either been just plugging it in and expecting it to work right out the box ( which when properly configured is as close to PC gaming as you can get...i swear) like Spitfish products where you need to only move the dial to get the settings right (you can also download software from there site and reset key presses and sensitivity)but still needs customizations to work right.    But my Kill to death ratio has been getting better and better each night on Killzone 3 that it seems like cheating at times because its just too PC like. I played with the Frag FX and it was good, but i swear nothing like this thing is...and this is coming from a pc gamer to PS3 so my transition has been smooth and i would not lead my fellow gamers down a wrong path. Just give it a try and really look on Penguin United forums, they have alot of help for users looking to get there Eagle Eye's dialed in correctly. And to all the haters out there, don't complain about the Laggy controls, its not the device,we all play from different regions, it's server lag Einstein's    Games tested are Socom 4, Killzone 2-3, MW 2 and Resistance 2 all work GREAT!!! besides playing from hawaii with all the lag, i still hold my own =) BuLLeTCoLeKToR
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Bringing back a franchise after such a long time and still paying homage to a bunch of things in the original is no small task.  I really enjoyed the movie, although the CGI was sometimes a bit too obvious.  Overall, my wife and I loved it, and we regretted missing it in the theaters.
B00006FM77|5.0|this was the first rock album i ever owned way back in the day. i must say it was a real treat to see the posters again even though they are no longer wall sized. i was not that impressed with the re mastering. i think it actually took some sparkle out of the original recording. but if u have never heard it before u wont miss it the discs still sound excellent. and the bonus material was ehhhh...it kind of gave me the impression that it was stuff that wasnt up to par to be on the original release  but over all die hard Chicago fans will appreciate the inclusion of extra content. this is a great version of this recording and is price point effective against some of the earlier releases that are just insane as far as cost so if u want this and dont have the original or the original cd release it is definitely worth the money. the posters and the book are just cool. and if you are a terry kath fan thsn this collection is a must

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is a great album by the Foos.  Depending on your taste it may not be your favorite but it is the best they've come out with in a very long time.  I've followed the bands since the 90s and thought they were in a bit of a creative rut before taking a break, but they made up for it with this release.  Every track is solid.  The Foo Fighters are back!    It meshes the old sound with the new, so no matter what your taste is everyone will find something to like here.

B00005MM01|5.0|I originally bought the single vinyl LP \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\" when it was first released, and it was my favorite album.  When the local store started carrying \\"A Gift...\\" I conned a friend to trade an Animals record for my \\"Wear Your Love...\\" album and bought \\"A Gift...\\".<br /><br />This was one of my all-time favorite albums of the late-60s.  From what I understand, it was the first Rock album Box Set.  The original vinyl box set packaging is beautiful and contains a nice set of prints with drawings and the lyrics to all the songs on the second album.  I still have those prints/lyrics, carefully preserved!<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned that the CD liner notes are too small.  I agree, however this is true about all CDs, and one area where there has been a true loss over the years.  Album art reached a peak in the 1960s, during those vinyl years when the package was large enough to appreciate the art and read the liner notes.  The packaging on this album in particular suffered, as both the exterior and interior art, as well as liner notes and lyrics are quite wonderful, and can't really be appreciated in the tiny CD format.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the set was originally broken up into two albums, \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\" and \\"For Little Ones\\".  I believe the record company was afraid the double album would not sell as well, and were subsequently proved wrong.<br /><br />In any case, the basic premise is that \\"Wear your Love...\\" was for adults and \\"Little Ones\\" was for children.  But, in fact, some of the songs on \\"Wear  Your Love...\\"  (e.g. \\"Oh Gosh\\", \\"Someone Singing\\") could easily be viewed as children's songs, and some songs on \\"Little Ones\\" (e.g. \\"Enchanted Gypsy\\", \\"Voyage Into the Golden Screen\\", \\"Isle of Islay\\") could have been included on the \\"adult\\" album.<br /><br />I would say the first album is a bit more electric and psychedelic, whereas the second album is more acoustic (i.e. \\"unplugged\\" in modern parlance).<br /><br />A good example of the \\"unplugged\\" sound of the second album would be \\"Song of the Naturalists Wife\\" with a simple banjo accompaniment.<br /><br />This box set quickly became my favorite album at the time.  However, after moving into more Jazz-fusion and Prog rock in the 1970s, I gradually stopped listening to this.<br /><br />Recently I began digitalizing my old vinyl albums.  When I recorded these albums, I realized how much I missed listening to this.  The music is so fresh and innocent.  Listening to it is like a refreshing breath of cool ocean breeze.<br /><br />However, the old vinyl was filled with skips and pops which were a large detraction.  So this was the first of the vinyl albums that I felt compelled to get a new CD of.<br /><br />Given how old this album is, it would have been nice if they had included some alternate takes, bonus tracks etc.  However, I still feel it was worth every penny just to get a pristine new digital version of this truly unique and wonderful box set.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I just realized that Amazon never verified this purchase for some reason.  I not only had this LP years ago, but also purchased a new CD from Amazon.  Somehow their accounting got screwed up.um would be \\"Song of the Naturalists Wife\\" with a simple banjo accompaniment.    This box set quickly became my favorite album at the time.

B0044XV3R8|1.0|I'm giving this one star because all three versions of the movie are split across two discs.    I was very frustrated halfway through the movie when I learned I had to switch to disc 2.  Seriously??  Are we still in 1996??  This is just Fox deliberately making it hard to have one good copy of the movie.  Want the full thing on one disc?  You have to buy the original edition that has zero extras.  Want the special features?  You have to buy the edition with each movie split across two different discs.  Clearly they just want people to buy both editions because I'm quite certain you can fit a full movie onto one DVD these days.  This is incredibly frustrating!  Not to mention the discs are basically just lying in a cardboard sheet that doesn't really slide out all that easily.  Terrible packaging, terrible execution and terrible setup.  At least the movie was good.    I'm most likely going to return this one.  This is the most disappointing DVD release I've ever bought and I've bought hundreds.  Studios should really learn to treat their consumers a little better.
B004LSJCJM|2.0|Dustbowl is a slight improvement on Black Rock but still a ponderous; songs sort of drift one to the next with no real stand-outs. Heartbreaker cover is OK and Whale That Swallowed Jonah is actually a great song but by track 10 I'm in snooze mode. Great guitar solos alone are not going to be enough to immortalize JB: he needs great songs too (especially with stage charisma about 3/10 ...and I've still to see him live in South Africa). I'm getting the sense...10 albums later...that songwriting isn't ever going to be JB's talent (although \\"Jonah\\" suggests I may still be proven wrong). JB needs to get himself out of the rut: a new producer (may look up Michael Barbiero's number (Gov't Mule)...KS is really bring nothing new to the party; a new kick-ass line-up could also help.JB needs to get re-discover his nuts otherwise his going keep on sliding into mediocrity.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|This album is everything I could have hoped for, and more.  I've heard (a few not many) complaints about the departure of WT's old sound, compared to previous albums.  I don't see that as being a problem - it still sounds like WT, and besides, music evolves and changes with the times.  If they put out exactly the same stuff as back in the 90s, would that sell nowadays?<br /><br />This album is really great.  I've been listening to it for about a week straight so far, and my favorite track keeps changing.  That's how I know if it's a good album - if I listen to every single song, and my favorite is pretty much every track at some point.<br /><br />Sinead is super catchy and will stay in your head for several days.  Shot in the Dark is the same way, I love the strings in that song.  Faster is sweet, Where is the Edge sounds really nice with the guitars, Iron is a rad upbeat guitar-filled song that kicks ass, Lost is just harrowing and beautiful.  I like Stairway to the Skies and A Demon's Fate, too.<br /><br />The music videos and behind-the-scenes are wonderful.  I love all the videos, but honestly most of the times skip through the beginning part (story-line) cause I've already seen it and I just want to see the band.  I love the way Sharon interacts with the camera, she's in control of the room and the videos - I can't take my eyes off her!<br /><br />An all-around, really solid, really awesome album.  I'm so happy.  This is not mediocre in any way, but surpasses all my expectations.  There is not one bad track on this entire album.  I'm looking forward so much to seeing them in NYC in the fall.  Long live WT!

0439796644|5.0|War Horse by Michael Morpurgo     Imagine  a British cavalry unit in the early days of WW I, sabers brandished, charging an entrenched foe deployed in trenches,   protected by  barbed wire and the surrounding woods,  fortified with blazing machine guns.  Of the men and horses in the British attack, only one of their valiant captains   (the other one was killed in the charge) and two of their magnificent horses broke through the German lines. The officer was taken prisoner, the horses pressed into ambulance transport service. Joey, and his sidekick Topthorn, went in that instant from being the pride of their cavalry unit to war horses serving the German army.      \\"War Horse\\" (1982) is Joey's story and it is told from the horse's point of view. The author's decision to have Joey tell the story is a literary device that dates back to \\"Black Beauty\\" (1877. Morpurgo made the decision after he witnessed a boy with such a severe stutter that he hadn't uttered a word in two years speak fluently to a horse in his care at the Morpurgo farm for poor children. He was struck by how well they understood each other.      The story begins with Joey's days on the farm in the English country side where it formed a strong attachment to Albert, the boy who treasured him and trained him before his father sold Joey to British Army at the outset of the war. A favorite of the soldiers it served with on both sides, Joey was in the thick of the fighting for months on end and emerges with the scars to prove it.     Morpurgo, Britain's pre-eminent children's book author (he has 120 to his credit) told the New York Times (see article in The Arts section in the April 12, 2011 edition) that the publication of \\"War Horse\\" in 1982 was a \\"huge nonevent\\". It pretty much remained so until 2007 when the Handspring Puppet Company of South Africa presented a dramatic version of the book at London's National Theater.  The horses in the story were created as life-sized puppets. The Times reports that \\"theplay was a huge, emotional triumph, leaving audiences wrung out and weeping.\\" From there, book sales flourished. Scholastic Press, its U.S. publisher, has already sold over 500,000 copies.  Now the play can be seen at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York and Steven Spielberg's film version will reach movie houses in December, 2011.
B003L7DK6U|4.0|What can I say about this movie that's not already been said?  It's a great one, with Bruce Lee at his finest.  Great cast, great production.  Blu-Ray brings the movie home like you've never see it before, and the extras that come with it are marvelous.  Highly recommended to any Bruce Lee or martial arts movie fan.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Until I happened to make purchase of the Firefly series, I thought the old Star Wars was the ultimate space flick. And I cannot understand what the allure of Firefly is, but I absolutely cannot get enough of it. I guess I've lost it, because I watch those 3 disc's over and over and over. I long to be a member of the crew and I have NEVER had anything in the movie world affect me like Firefly has. Saying that Fox was premature in their closing the doors on the greatest series ever, is the most gargantuan understatement ever made. And as many fans as the series has, I don't understand why someone is not picking up on the vibe. Even though two of the crewman were lost in the Serenity movie, somehow, someone needs to have the foresight (or hindsight) to reestablish this series. Just reincarnate Book and Wash and get the thing rolling again. I am aching for more and more. Personally, I would like to see the series run FOREVER. I guess all this probably sounds pretty dumb and stupid, unless your a real fan. But to me, Firefly is the epitome of all TV series, no matter what the genre.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I LOVE THE DELETED SCENES!!!!!!!!!.<br /><br />There, I said it!!.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about the movie.  I loved begining to end, and I'm not a Treker by a long shot.  Never seen the original series and never saw any movie.  Actually I did saw a few episodes of Star Trek New Generation and it was cool. Also I saw that movie where Captain Piccard met Jim Kirk.  I didn't understood it but it was good.<br /><br />Anyway, now that I stated the movie rocked my world, I can go to the meat of this collection:  THE EXTRAS!!.<br /><br />I love the fact that, for the casting, Abrahams as for permission to the original actors.  He actually went with them and tell them \\"I got this kid that'll play your character.  Can I do it?.  Are you agree?\\".  That's respect!.  Also he consult the script with Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner.  THAT'S RESPECT!!!.<br /><br />I can go on and on regarding the features, but what I love the most were the Deleted Scenes.  Until now I thought the scene where young Kirk throws the car to the cliff was pointless, however there as a built to all of that, and that build explain why he didn't raised as the cool captain he was in the original series but in a young brilliant punk.  I just loved that!.<br /><br />Plus, where did Nero wait for 25 years!!?.  I wondered about that so much, and I got it in a sweet deleted scene!!.  How could Jim insert a virus on the tests for captain?.  MAN!!!!.  I love the deleted scenes!!!.<br /><br />I got this Blue-Ray at a good price, and is one of my best purchases.  I can watch this movie a thousand times and enjoying it, but is the extras where I really got my money's worth.<br /><br />CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!.  WRATH OF THE TREKKERS!!!!!!

I love to listen to the disc in the kitchen while cooking, it's wonderful.<br /><br />If you enjoyed her first CD you'll love '21', if you are just looking for someone with a gorgeous voice to sing the blues, get this disc!
B002JJ91IM|4.0|There is no greater composer than Mozart, and his operas are so beautiful. But unfortunately, the operas in this set are poorly packaged. I am having to build my own playlist of Die Zauberflöte. The songs are in the wrong order. They put the overture at the end and the songs within the act are in alphabetical order instead of the order in which they should be performed. I know very little about the earlier operas so will just enjoy the music without any idea of what is going on in them. The later operas are going to have to be organized into proper playlists, and that will take up my time. This is a great buy if you just want to enjoy incredibly beautiful music, but I don't understand why they messed up the order of the component songs.

0743486285|5.0|Just days before I went in to open heart surgery at age 34, after weeks of listening to the new Sixx AM cd, I found this book in a store and bought it. After two surgeries and a new heart valve, I was finally able to start reading the book. I'd began writing my own memoirs only weeks earlier as I tried to make sense of all that was going on in my world, so this was the perfect book to inspire me to continue those memoirs.<br /><br />I've been a huge Crue fan for years. The only books I'd read since high school were Dirt, Marilyn Manson's book, and Brock Yates's book about the original Cannonball Run. I'd partied until I blacked out and forgot what state I was in until the cops told me in jail. I'd built choppers, owner exotic cars, and averaged $1400/month in bars. I was no where near the level of these guys, but as close as i could get and still maintain an engineering career.

After the last couple weeks, we even both temporarily died twice, and doctors had to kickstart our hearts. We're both extremists that have to abstain to survive since we never could learn to temper our self-destructive nature.\\"<br /><br />I sent a copy of my book to Nikki, letting him know how much that book inspired me and helped me through that time in my life.

014241011X|4.0|How fun is Roald Dahl?!  He is, to my mind, without a doubt one of the most imaginative human beings to ever live.  He manages to write children's books that adults also love; books that are best categorized as \\"odd\\" yet also somehow timeless and classic.  [[ASIN:014241011X The Witches]] is one that I had actually never read as a child - I picked it up at a used book sale recently and decided it was long past time I read it.  And I was not disappointed.  Dahl has a rare gift - the ability to turn an adult into a child again simply through the use of words.  He paints his world so evocatively - his descriptions of the trials and tribulations of being a more-than-usually-clever child trapped in a more-than-usually-challenging adult world make it possible for even the most grown-up grown up to remember what it is to be small and uncertain and reliant on others.  I, for one, will never look at \\"ordinary women\\" entirely the same again...

[[ASIN:0743298039 The Thirteenth Tale]] is a joy to read - or listen to (even though I am not normally a fan of audiobooks, believe me, this one is worth listening to - the clipped British accent lends the appropriate gravitas to the story and makes it an auditory as well as intellectual treat).  The interwoven stories of Vida, the famous author with an unknown past, and Margaret, the ing&eacute;nue hand-picked to reveal it, are delicately tangled together into a complex and strangely unified whole that is sure to capture your imagination.  The cast of supporting characters is impressive both in scale and scope - as are the settings for the various chapters of each woman's life.  It is a mystery wrapped in an enigma twisted around a secret - and I virtually guarantee you will not be able to put it down until you know exactly how the pieces fit together.
B002ZG976U|3.0|Ingredients:<br /><br />1 Mary Sue female protagonist.  Preferred traits: American (from a small town), white, young, sexy but not in a flagrant \\"slutty\\" way, hugely talented, determined, befriends/bewitches all she meets, bends the rules but never gets into any real trouble from it, gets a job by simply picking up a tray and starting to wait tables, can learn dance moves in a few weeks during her work as a waitress in Club, earns grudging respect from \\"enemies\\", able to resolve conflicts in a single bound, best if played by a former pop starlet who has decent acting talents<br /><br />1 actor/singer in a comeback role.  Best if actor/singer was greatly loved and drawn out of retirement for this role.<br /><br />Several decent actors and actresses thrown at cliched or underused roles to taste.<br /><br />1 drunken/high rival who succumbs to the Power of the Mary Sue.  Choose a mild rival, one that doesn't do anything too mean and \\"rival-y\\".<br /><br />Several mildly sexual dance numbers with Mary Sue, but do not recreate anything as risque as an actual Burlesque show.<br /><br />1 song number with comeback singer/actor that is thrown awkwardly into the plot.  Optional: Make the song one about \\"overcoming\\" some undefined \\"obstacle\\".<br /><br />2 Love Interests.  Love Interest A (may or may not be the first guy Mary Sue meets) must be sweet, romantic and witty.  Love Interest B must be a super wealthy businessman wanting to buy the Club, who will drop the Chekov's Gun so Mary Sue can solve the problem and will disappear from the movie when True LoveTM conquers all.<br /><br />1 discreet sex scene with Love Interest A.  Best if this scene is intercut with a melodic ballad about True LoveTM sung while Mary Sue is dressed in a classy evening gown at the Club.<br /><br />5+ plot lines.  One must be the Romantic Triangle.  Please choose remaining from the following: drunken Rival, Divorced Club Owners working together, Gay Best Friend who can't have a decent relationship, the Club is closing because the Owners need X dollars in Y months (X MUST BE much, much greater than Y), Club Owner and one of the dancers has a falling out wherein dancer says she slept with Club Owner's husband, Love Interest A is a Songwriter, Love Interest A is engaged but will let his sexy \\"Friend\\" stay with him for an indeterminate amount of time, Love Interest B was never Rival's \\"boyfriend\\"<br /><br />Gather ingredients in a large, flashy location (Los Angeles works if New York City is not available).  Toss indiscriminantly for two hours; Serve immediately.<br /><br />Now, despite all that I've written above...the movie actually isn't half bad.  Yes, it's cliched, yes, Christina's character is a glaring Mary Sue, yes, the characters are one dimensional.  But if you expect that going in (like I did), there is a lot you can enjoy.<br /><br />Christina Aguilera isn't a half bad actress.  The only reason she doesn't get higher marks in my book is because her character is so painfully cliched, and Christina never tried to add any depth to that portrayal.  But she does sing well (for those that like her brand of singing), and her dancing is WOW!  Cher is amazing.  She lit up the screen every time she was on, and I thought her portrayal of a club owner about to go under was one of the most convincing I've ever seen.  I loved her musical numbers as well and wished she had sung more.  Stanley Tucci was stunning.  Sure, he is yet again Gay Best Friend, but he does it well without coming off too cliched.  And his chemistry against Cher was pure joy.  Some of the musical numbers were bland (another version of \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\"?), but others were really great (the last number was really catchy).<br /><br />So, if you are a Cher or Christina Aguilera fan, you will probably love this.  If you love musicals, you will probably also like this (maybe not as much, since it is cliched).  It's not the most original movie out there, but it isn't the worst I've ever seen.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*
0385341679|3.0|I hate when a series starts out like a house afire and ends with a trickle of water.  The Fever series was, for me, a prime example of this.  It started out fabulously (I have reviews of the other books, if you are interested - just go to my review page) - it was never high literature but the series presented a fun and interesting take on the urban fantasy theme, strong characters, and generally engaging writing.  I waited and waited for [[ASIN:0385341679 Shadowfever]], the final installment - and then after I had finished it, I wondered what had happened, both to the story and the series.  I don't need every book to wind up neatly with resolution on every question and happy warm fuzziness overcoming everyone - but I do need to understand why things ended the way they did, and with this book I did not.  Mac's journey from sweet innocent Georgia girl to dark violent righteous whatever-she-is was an intriguing one, but I still feel like it is unfinished - and for the purported final book in a series, that is an unsatisfying feeling.

0143038419|5.0|I at first didn't know if this was something I wanted to read. I had heard poor things about this book. I was very happy I read it and didn't put it down.
B004P02OJ6|4.0|Not a lot to say; Russel Crowe plays a believable and distressed husband and father that will go to no end to reunite his family.  Some action, lots of suspense.  Altogether an enjoyable movie.

0786852550|4.0|To compare the Bartimaeus Trilogy to Harry Potter is like comparing apples and oranges.  They are both fantasy novels about a young boy going into manhood.  Similarities end there.  In MANY fantasy books magic is hidden from society.  In this series magic runs society.      One thing I like that others seemed to have found fault with was the characterization of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus.  Nathaniel is a product of his environment.  Yes, when you take a child from his parents and place him in the home of a stranger where they will not love him, but essentially force feed him a twisted ideal of how the world should be, you will get a character that is difficult to like.  It's the passion from the characters that makes them likeable in these stories not neseccarily their actions.      Bart is just plain sarcastic and fun.  I love the footnotes.  I love the bragging and bravado.      If you want a different more mature view of an interesting magical world pick up the trilogy.  I can't promise you won't be disappointed, but if you're a fantasy freak like me I can't see how you could be.    Now my essense aches so this is where I'll be dismissing myself.  Enjoy!
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Let's cut to the chase: Black Country Communion was the most powerful hard rock/blues band of the year 2010. Listen to the last track and you'll see what I mean. Just waiting for the next CD!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is probably the best and most useful app  I've ever gotten. It allows me to listen to the radio stations from back home and I get even clearer reception if my local stations than I do through my radio. I play it every single day. Love it!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this (elsewhere) for my jogging stroller, which didn't come with any kind of accessory tray (I guess they figured you could reach under the seat into the tiny mesh carrier for your water).  I then went back and bought two more for the other strollers.  This thing rocks.  It holds a bottle or sippy in one drink holder, my Thermos double-walled water bottle or my double-walled coffee mug in the other (which don't fit in standard hard-plastic accessory trays), plus phone, keys, snack pod, earbuds, sunglasses, and probably a small elementary school in the middle compartment.  It wears extremely well and is very tough, withstanding an energetic toddler tugging on it in a mistaken effort to rip it off for access to the aforementioned snack pod.  I've had it for a year now with no fading.  Did I mention I love this thing?
0684857219|5.0|Whether you be looking to get into shape or put some good size on you, this is the bible for fitness guru's.  I bought the previous edition of this book about 10 years ago when I was into powerlifting.  It was a great reference then and is even a better reference now! It covers Arnolds life, dieting, body types, weight training exercises, stretching exercises, various training schedules for beginners all the way up to professional bodybuilders. I recently bought this edition to replace my older version that got messed up in a move.  It is a geat read if you can sit down and read it all the way and I think that it is my bible to weight training.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Don't like all the one star reviews by those of us not even yet reading your books?  Perhaps less subtle protest of prices will get your attention.  Although many Kindle users will pay the $12-$13 or more for an e-book, there are now many who will use their library card, wait for the paperback or worse yet for you, borrow the paperback from a friend.  Get real.  Some people will pay full price to have the hardbound book the first week it is out, some will pay half price from cut price retailers, some will wait for the paperback and pay full price and many, many will borrow from the library, borrow from a friend or swap for books not read, or buy a Kindle edition for a reasonable amount of money.  Return to prices of $7.99 - $9.99 and watch your numbers rise.  Simple math - 9.99 X 10 equals 99.90, 12.99 X 1 is 12.99.  Wouldn't you rather sell ten?
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I bought this movie because I don't have a Blue-Ray DVD player yet but the movie itself is awesome!  If you like action packed science fiction movies then this is for you!  Graphics are awesome!
B00064WSNW|4.0|Beat and Three of a Perfect Pair aren't even in the same league.  Discipline has BOTH of those albums beat (hehe) in terms of melody and instrumental sections that actually delight listeners (in addition to the majority of the album not sounding nearly as dated as the next two King Crimson albums- with the exception of \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" perhaps).    I actually like \\"The Sheltering Sky\\".  Yes it is perhaps overdone with the amount of guitar synths (or whatever those things are- I suppose they are simply referred to these day as \\"Frippertronics\\", whatever).  It doesn't take away from the fact the song is fairly melodic and does actually create a mood.  Of course the mood that's presented here can be found in numerous 80's songs by several other bands, but who cares- I like it.  By the way, not to criticize or lessen the impact of the song or anything, but I have a hard time referring to it as jazzy.  It just feels a little too fruity to ever consider putting it in the same league as jazz, but maybe that's just me.    Now with the rest of King Crimson's 80's discography, I make constant comparisons to the Talking Heads, Duran Duran or the final period of the Police.  I can't really compare any of the stuff on Discipline to *any* of those bands.  This means Discipline is a unique album that most certainly deserves your attention.    Songs like \\"Elephant Talk\\" and \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\" are just so incredibly melodic with slight touches of bizarre experimentation that it works brilliantly.  I love these songs.  The idea here is to be experimental just enough to excite listeners, but not distract them... and it works.    Oh sure I could nitpick and say that the actual talking bits in \\"Elephant Talk\\" are pointless but the way the lead singer raises his voice during the \\"Talk talk talk, conversations, criticisms!\\" line is really cool.  Plus the cheesiness of the elephant-roaring sound effects using *some* kind of computer equipment (or perhaps it's a guitar- again, it's really difficult to sort out what's actually taking place) is not only quite hilarious, but *memorable*.  Perhaps \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\" is distractingly repetitive and doesn't deserve being over 6 minutes long, but the rhythm is splendid and downright groovy, so I don't mind.  I can definitely do without the talking bits in THIS case, though.      A song like \\"Frame By Frame\\" has a vocal melody I'm not particularly fond of, but I've definitely heard worse.  It's still better than most of the Beat album, for example.  The title song reminds me of a Rubik's Cube for some reason, hehe.  Perhaps it's the carefully layered and repetitive instrumental chops that should be annoying... but aren't (perhaps because it's just so darn *different* from anything I've ever had the pleasure -or displeasure- of hearing before).      \\"Indiscipline\\" features a *magnificent* introduction with the melodic guitar tricks making it seem like you've just fallen under a dizzy spell.  I absolutely love this song.    No, this stuff can't compare to the older version of King Crimson, but then again, not much *can*.   I still highly recommend it though.  Discipline is most certainly a step in the right direction for a band that unfortunately didn't have many more right directions after this album was released.  In fact they got worse- a LOT worse, haha.  Oh well.  Listen to Discipline anyway.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I've always viewed Joe's workaholic approach to spitting out albums as risky and I was worried that Dust Bowl might be \\"just another album\\". How wrong was I? With Dust Bowl Joe takes his craft to an entirely new level and firmly establishes his reputation, not only as one of the greatest blues guitarists on the planet, but also one of the greatest blues/rock artists on the planet. This album takes the legacy of his other works and builds on them to form an album with so much going on its hard to cover it all on one page - the playing is understated just enough so there is space and each song breathes, the songs are finely layered and expertly executed, the production courtesy of Kevin \\"Caveman\\" Shirley is superb, and there is a deep-deep pocket in every tune (thanks no doubt to one of the best rhythm sections ever put together in the last 10 years - Carmine Rojas on bass, Rick Melick on keys and Anton Fig on drums). This is not just a showcase of Joe's prodigious guitar licks, monster tone and - yes, it is not up for debate anymore- his signature sound. This album is more than a guitar album - this album is FUNKY with an underlying groove that puts a smile on your face or a spring in your step. Moreover,  Joe's vocal performance is by far his best yet and reveals an artist that has developed, matured and is brave enough to keep moving forward. The cameos by John Hiatt, Glenn Hughes and Vince Gill are inspired - Joe is a selfless musician and he leaves his ego at the door. I could write another 1000 words on this album, but simply suggest you sit back in the dark, crank up the volume and let that Slow Train start the journey for you. Joe is really hitting his straps now.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I have never anticipated an album so much, and I was not disappointed. This is by far one of my favorite albums I've ever listened to, it's an amazing unique mixture of rock, pop, and hip hop.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I love this case have had it over a year now and still works great i love that is is big for plenty of wipes to cover messes and diaper changes. Its also easy to grab a wipe one handed. Great item dont hesitate based on some reviews.
0802473164|5.0|I think many guys, myself included, are in a box when it comes to loving our wives.  I did things my way but neither of us were happy, we stayed together for the kids.  One night i decided that the problem must be me.  I talked with my wife and told her i was going to change for her.  The only thing was that i didn't know how to change.  I went to the book store and found this book and read it and it made perfect sense and it was just too easy.  I recommend you to read the book but only read it if you are willing to change, if you are not then you are wasting your time and no one can help you.  YOU must be ready to give love and accept love.

1439190275|4.0|I hope to use all the information provided in this book.  Even if I cannot complete a total change, it has certainly given me incentive to make adjustments in what I eat.
0634022296|5.0|This book is a treasure. I've learned so much about the Beatles as composers and players. The chords and organization make this book a players delight.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|There are few bands capable of putting out a 'perfect album'. Perfection is subjective to say the least, but I firmly believe in this one. From 'Burning Bridges' to 'Walk' this album doesn't miss a beat. This is perfect.    1. Bridges Burning: The Foo's first released a 30 second clip of this song about a month before the albums release and it left me begging for more. Killer, energetic opening. Great lyrics. Grohl and the crew love writing songs that they can start shows off 'with a bang' with and this is certainly a show starter. This song demonstrates why having 3 guitarists is a blessing.     2. Rope: This song took a little while to grow on me. It was released as a first single, so I was expecting something along the lines of 'The Pretender'. This song is not my favorite on the album, but I find myself loving it more and more none-the-less.    3. Dear Rosemary: Everytime I listen to this track I think to myself, \\"Why the heck do I keep passing this track up?\\". It's an incredible song with an awesome groove. I think I keep passing it because of the sheer magnitude of all the tracks that I haven't been able to focus on this one or 'Miss the Misery' enough.     4. White Limo: Dave: \\"Seriously guys! We only have this Limo for another hour! Taylor! Grab your camcorder! It's song time!\\"... And this is the story of how the most intense song on the album was made. There is no way to stop your head from banging. DON'T RESIST.    5. Arlandria: This in my mind is the second single. It's the song I've listened to the most, it's catchy and well written. With lyrics like \\"Use me up! Spit me out! Let me be your hand me down!\\"... This song eminates a fist-pumping beauty.    6. These Days: Powerful song. The chorus reminds me of something that belongs on 'In Your Honor'. This song demonstrates Dave's mastery of lyrics.    7. Back & Forth: Classic 90's FOO. This song speaks for itself.    8. A Matter of Time: The Pre-chorus to this song threw me off a bit at first. The verse sounds like it's about to lead into something totally different, but changes pace a bit. However, it's grown on me and I can't stop listening to this song at the moment. Lovin' it.    9. Miss the Misery: I've read a few of reviews where people claim this is there least favorite song on the album. I personally think people are just to pre-occupied with other songs to concentrate on this one. In all honesty, if this song were on 'Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace', I think it would have been the second or third single. This album is that good.    10. I Should Have Known: This song is Hauntingly beautiful. I can still feel it echoing throughout my bones.    11. Walk: Wow. What can I say about this song... 2:07-3:10. This is the most powerful, emotional part of the entire album.    Sorry for only putting 5 stars. But sadly, there isn't a higher option available... I encourage any fan of Rock music to purchase this album and enjoy.
B00127RAJY|1.0|After having 3 different existing patients that had rehabbed their old disc injuries show up in my clinic in the past 2 weeks after working out with this DVD, I took a look.  After reviewing it, practically every ab exercise flexes the lumbar spine, which studies have shown is one of the quickest ways to herniate a disc.  This \\"old school\\" sit up and crunch method will give you great abs...at the expense of the discs in the lumbar spine.  If you have prior injury there, you should stay away from this.  If you want to avoid disc injury, you should stay away from this.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Loved the movie but was disappointed that the copy I received had NO specials, as advertised.  Just the movie and only the movie on the disc.  So I feel like I kinda got screwed in that regard.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I have been a FF fan since the inception.  I am not going to go into detail.  Just get these tunes, buy the disc or download it.  The songs grow on you very quickly.  I defy anyone to listen to \\"Rope,\\" especially the solo section from about 2:50 into the song to about 3:30, and tell me this is not a great band!  It's a tight, multi-layered wall of sound and Shiflett's solo is mind-bending.  Well-worth our wait.
0670022411|4.0|As a Twilight fan, I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the mature relationship between Diana and Matthew.  I could not help but notice the similarities between this book and the Twilight series but I am nonetheless axiously awaiting the second book.  I must say the ending was a let down, I was expecting so much more, all I could say was, \\"That's it?\\"  Bravo though, bravo, overall it was an ejoyable read.

0060755598|1.0|Not recommended. There are definitely some nuggets of good information here: on why many people who start a business fail, the need for market research, the need for a real business plan, etc.     Then there's the bulk of the book. Some ideas from the book: if you don't want to sell your business in the future, you have no business starting a company. In the history of mankind, nobody has ever made a rational buying decision - they couldn't if they wanted to because NOBODY knows how. It's all rote, it's all formula, it's all a system from which you must not deviate.     One chapter gives an example: the author will never go back to that barber again. The three times he went the haircut was very good. The problem is the barber used scissors-only once and a combination of a trimmer and scissors another time. One time they offered him coffee and the next time they offered him wine. That just drove him nuts. Consistency is not more important than quality. For this writer consistency is the definition of quality. McDonalds is the best hamburger in the world because it is the same each time you order it. There is a whole chapter on how much he adores McDonalds.     Finally, what I really did not like was the black-and-white tone. This is the ONLY way to do it. Do it any other way and you will lose all your money, your business will fail and everybody will know you are a loser. When he compared two ways of doing something to prove his point, it was his way vs a ridiculous way. He says you must wear a blue suit. As proof, would you buy from someone wearing an orange suit with alligator boots and a 2-carat tie pin and... You get the idea.     Worst part is I listened to the book on CD and had to slog through the entire thing. I kept hoping for a good part, but never found it.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather, by Mario Puzo, is a book about the mafia in New York. It takes place in the 1940s all the way through the 1950s. It gives a backstory of Vito Corleone, the Don, and his early life in America. During this, you will learn how the infamous Don Corleone was introduced to a life of crime. This is an amazing classic that will hold the reader from start to finish. Also, you will see a startling change in one character that will shock you from the moment you read about it.   The Godfather will never fail to surprise you through its pages. The story begins at the wedding of Connie Corleone, the Don's daughter. After a request from his godson, Don Corleone takes matters into his own hands when it comes to a movie producer. Before an attempt on his father's life, Michael Corleone always stayed away from his father's way of life. No one reading would ever suspect what Michael would turn out to be. When Sollozo, a drug dealer, arranges to meet with Michael, Michael Corleone shoots him. This proved to be the turning point in Michael's life when he officially entered the mafia world. He later becomes the Don of the Corleone family. Not only that, but while in hiding, his brother, Sonny, was killed.      This is a realistic fiction book because it shows the life and actions of the mafia. However, the characters in this story are not based on real people. Michael went from a law-respecting citizen to a criminal, changing in almost every way. The readers learn that even though Vito Corleone is the leader of a mafia family, he is an intelligent man who is known for being respected by both his friends and enemies. The Corleone Family is a mixture of young and old Italians. One of the oldest, Vito Corleone, was the original Don and his youngest son, Michael, is the current one. This book is intended for anyone who enjoys suspense, mystery, and surprises.

B0029LHX1W|4.0|I did not realize this novel was based upon a real serial killer in Soviet Russia.  I will tell you that this is a debut novel by a new writer and deservices a read.    The book is fast paced, speaks volumes about soviet life, is gritty yet never morbid.  Well worth your time reading.
0743200799|3.0|Boy, seems like a chapter didn't go by without finding out that Gene's wife was pregnant once again. I know he's Roman Catholic, but geez!  :)    Joking aside, I ultimately enjoyed the book because it gave me some insight into the job of a flight controller and I enjoy reading about space exploration. I only gave it 3 stars because while the content was page turning, I found the writing style to be less than engaging.    Some reviewers say Kranz comes off as full of himself, but I didn't see that at all. He uses the word \\"I\\" a lot because it's an autobiography of his career. Give him a break.    After reading his book, I have a lot of respect for Kranz. He left a legacy of effective Mission Control combined with a complete lack of Birth Control.

I honestly laughed out loud, cried, and could not wait to read what would happen next. I would highly recommend this book to those who love a story that will touch your heart. The only negative thing I have to say about this book was that it ended...

B0007TKNII|5.0|I do not know how I missed seeing this wonderful movie when it came out in 2004, but thank God I finally did see it.  It is the single best movie I ever watched.  The music, the acting, the cinema work, special effects, and everything you expect in a movie is here.  Emmy Rossum, Gerald Gerard, and Patrick Wilson were superb.  I could go on and on about this movie, but I had rather say simply say \\"Buy it, you will not regret it\\".  I have watched it over 10 times already.  I especially like the captions feature.  You won't miss a word.
1439102724|5.0|I've read all of Jodi's books and it never ceases to amaze me how she opens my mind to the most controversial subjects. This book is certainly NOT a disappointment. I find that after I read a chapter, I put the book down and actually thought about what I had just read. I had a discussion with myself! I am a 60 year old woman, so being brought up in the 50's and 60's the subjects of in-vitro, and lesbianism were not heard of. Gays didn't exist (as far as I knew). It was enlightening to me to see how the characters in this book were so real in all that they went through. I have not read another author that has changed my insights in such a manner. Thank you, Jodi Picoult; can't wait for the next one!

1401223176|5.0|Let me start by saying I am typically a Marvel guy, and have rarely ventured outside the Marvel Universe when it come to reading comics. Sure i have seen the movies,watched the cartoons, and of course grew up with Adam West, but recently I have decided to step outside of my little shell and see what I have been missing... and boy, is it alot!<br /><br />This is quite possibly the best comic(tbp)that i have ever read.  The story is well crafted and incorporates all the major players in Gotham City.  No prior knowledge of Batman is needed in case you have been living under a rock. Jeph Loeb spins a beautiful web of mystery that completely encompasses the reader.<br /><br />In addition to the great story line, the art of Jim Lee is outstanding!  The cover alone is mezmerizing.  Lee totally captures the darkness of the Dark Night and his city of Gotham in every beautifully crafted frame.  I also quite enjoyed that they removed all the text from the original covers so you can fully bask in Jim's superior talent.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a must read for any comic fan, fringe or fanboy!  I was so impressed i went out and ordered another Batman book by Jeph Loeb, and am looking for anything done by Jim Lee.<br /><br />And although my heart is still deeply embedded withing the Marvel Universe, I will be taking many vacations to DC.  I can't believe it has taken me this long!!
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since I was a kid.  It's an absolute classic story of the man of steel with an amazing cast and amazing story telling by one of the best directors in Hollywood.  There will never be another Superman like Christopher Reeves.  One of the absolute best films of all time.  The DVD has scenes that were originally cut from the theatrical release which makes the whole of the movie that much better.  A must have for any Superman fan.
B004UJ6YNO|5.0|Her album is amazing! Jessie can sang her face off, & her songs are about real things. So, it's like bread with butter. It's great & greater. She has great production, great vocals, great songs & lyrics, so where can you go wrong. Fave tracks are: Who You Are, Abracadabra, Rainbow, Nobody's Perfect, Do It Like A Dude, Mama Knows Best. But, the whole album is truly a fave, if you buy it I promise you will not regret it. TRUE QUALITY, you're getting your monies worth.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a great bag for the price, its nice and light with lots of room. The only thing I don't like is the orange amazon zipper pulls, there are so many of them its kind of tacky like how Disney tags everything they put out. It is a great product though and I stand by it, I like how it has straps on the side to hold a tripod. its an all in one carry on and would be great for hiking.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I moved from the UK to the US recently, I just couldn't get over how cheap fast food was here. Watch this to understand why. We're all a little bit aware this stuff, but it's still a shock to see it all at once. The film is superbly made, honest, straightforward - not a conspiracy theory. Very much worth your time.
0743298039|4.0|This was a wonderful gothic suspense to read.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because somehow I couldn't connect with the heroine of the novel.  I liked all the characters around her but she seemed unreal to me.  But no matter, the book was still great.  I think I was sitting on the edge of the seat the whole book.  One of those you stay up all night to find out what happens at the end.
0486237664|5.0|i've had this book since i was a teenager, and it's been my most valued and used reference book ever.  full of every animal you can imagine from birds and reptiles to even strange extinct species.  most are straight forward, clear, detailed old fashioned etching style illustrations. also lots of more involved scenes with several animals in an environment. some are more goofy and dated looking, from the 19th century.  which i also love.  i've copied more animals out of this book than i can even remember.  a must have for any visual artist, even if you dont normally do realistic animals.  (wait.. how do an owl's eyes go?...)
B004I2K4DY|5.0|For any \\"Les Mis\\" fan this is the ultimate for you.  Hopefully you all have 5.1 in your home theatre.  If you do you'll know what i mean.  It's just beautiful and the ending with the original casts, it was enough to make you cry.  Pure magic.  Enjoy!
1416596585|2.0|Why is the Kindle version of the book, a digital download, only $1 less than the cost of the hardcover? This makes no sense and inhibits me from purchasing any ebooks at such prices.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a book I really enjoyed reading. Quick-paced, visceral yet sparse in detail. Full of humanity and spirit. I'd love to share it with my young nephew but...There are two passages in this book that would prohibit it from being part of any school-sponsered reading list. And both passages do nothing to enhance the story, The \\"N\\" word and the word \\"kike\\" even spoken in jest by a character just doesn't sit well with most people nowadays. I know from Orson Scott Card's Foreward that he is not against revisions. I suggest he removes these two racial slurs. It would turn my 4 star into a 5.
B003INBNXO|3.0|I ordered two of these dvds.  One was stolen by either the UPS man or the person who picked it up and gave it to me (co-worker).  Haven't found out who but in the future please wrap the envelope/package in packing tape so it will not be easy for someone to take the dvds out and re-seal them to look like it wasn't touched. The dvd played well which was a gift but I wanted one also.  The thief stole mine!
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|The scenery and cinematography will knock your socks off. Whether you will be happy with the interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's beloved novel depends on your expectations. It is a theatrical length, and so is quite edited, so it helps to be familiar with the story.<br /><br />However, even for the Jane virgins, this one is well worth seeing. A Jane Eyre for the new millennium!<br /><br />P.S. If you want a longer version of Jane Eyre which explains the story a little better (and has great sizzling chemistry between the leads) the 2006 BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is brilliant. If you only have time for a two hour flick, then the Mia Wasikowska/Michael Fassbender version will temporarily transport you to the Yorkshire moors and leave you rather breathless.
B004M9ZI0M|3.0|I feel very cheated that I didn't hear about this movie until after its very limited release was over. From what I can tell it was only in one theater in my state, for about a week! For such an interesting looking film I don't understand this crazy marketing scheme. Like you're going to make any money by not releasing it where people can actually see it! I am a Shakespeare fan, and a fantasy fan, and I have always wanted to see a fully fantastical version of The Tempest. With Helen Mirren playing Prospera, it's bound to be amazing. Now not only did I miss it in theaters, I have to wait until September for the DVD? I seriously don't get it. Why are you pissing off your target audience here?

B000XCZGV8|5.0|David Fincher is my favorite director, everything he makes is just art.. Zodiac is right up there with Se7en, American Psycho, and Silence of the Lambs. So underated, but Fincher always is. It's okay, his day will come. Best director of our time. (Long movie, but worth the wait.)
0060853972|5.0|This is the type of book that keeps giving; scenes revisited in random conversations, quotes shared with friends, the book itself passed on with the condition that it MUST be returned. I love how death SPEAKS LIKE THIS, how the Anti-Christ has a resourceful, plucky group of friends armed with bikes and snacks, and how an angel and demon who should be at odds, simply like each other.     There are times when I laughed out loud, folding over the page corner so I could read it again later to my husband. I can see the influence of both writers. One particular gruesome scene involving telemarketers just had to be written by Gaiman. All those elaborate footnotes were probably Pratchett. My edition of this book had an addendum where the two authors discussed their first meeting and how it worked to write the book together. Their musings are as entertaining as the story they wrote.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is really great. It does exactly what it says it will. I really liked it once I installed the free download on my PC.  It automatically syncs the two together so I can keep all my notes and to do lists updated without having to remember to do anything. Would recommend this app to anyone trying to get more organized.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I dont own this Dvd set as of yet..but I strongly advise buying it..Anybody who loved the 1990's will love this tv show.Just watching the highlights brought me back to my 20's with all the good music...Def advise this series too anybody.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Im a HUGE Twilight fan but even if I wasnt...there is no deneying this is a great movie with wonderful graphics! They did an excellent job with the werewolf/vampire race on the river! The only complaint I have is that they made Edwards face too white in this movie and the tent scene looks too fake...(come on guys the budget was bigger than fake snow and a fake background). However the story is fantastic and love triangles dont get much better than this! But to truely enjoy this series you have to read the books first! I cant wait for Breaking Dawn!! That book was my all time favorite and Ive read just about every book out there!
0316069353|5.0|THE FIFTH WITNESS by Michael Connelly is properly put in the Lincoln Lawyer concordance --- Harry Bosch makes an appearance, but don't blink or you'll miss it --- probably scheduled to coincide with the release of the film version of the introductory book. It is a \\"courtroom\\" or \\"legal\\" thriller by any definition, going from the client's arrest to trial preparation, trial and denouement. If one wants an unvarnished look into the professional life of a criminal trial attorney, this is it.    It has been said elsewhere --- tongue in cheek, of course --- that the practice of law would be a great profession if not for the clients. While the majority of clients encountered in virtually every area of law are reasonable, one does --- as with any job --- deal with people who are difficult; indeed, Mickey Haller has his hands more than full with Lisa Trammel. Haller has recently changed direction and focus in his practice due to some simple economics. There are fewer criminal defendants with the ability to pay the fees he needs to earn a living; accordingly, he is involved with defending homeowners in foreclosure actions.    Things take a bit of a turn when Trammel, one of his new foreclosure clients, is accused of murder and requests --- nay, demands! --- that Haller defend her. Trammel is well known as an activist on the issue of homeowner foreclosures and illegal bank practices. The murder victim, a bank vice-president named Mitchell Bondurant, had attracted Trammel's ire to the extent that a restraining order had been issued against her, compelling her to stay away from Bondurant and his place of employment. Trammel loudly and repeatedly proclaims her innocence, but there is eyewitness and forensic evidence against her. Haller's efforts to defend her are complicated by her personality --- she knows just enough to get herself in trouble and to pour sand into Haller's defense tank --- and her relationship with a shady movie agent.    But when Haller is warned away from thecase by a couple of thugs who administer a rather vicious beatdown, it simply makes him even more tenacious in his defense of the client. He needs every bit of his skills and talents, as well as those of his somewhat edgy support staff, to combat the ferocity of the district attorney prosecuting the case, a fireball against whom Haller has batted zero to date. As the proceedings seesaw back and forth, Haller deals with both professional and personal challenges that take him to the brink and beyond. Even after the trial has concluded, Haller is on the giving and receiving ends of a number of surprises, some of which undoubtedly will have ramifications in future installments of the series.    There are two extremely impressive elements in THE FIFTH WITNESS. The first is Connelly's effort to get the essence of criminal client representation correct, down to the last nuance. I have already mentioned the second --- the climactic series of surprises at the end of the book, which consist of a minor revelation and two major ones. Those who do not enjoy extended courtroom scenarios may find the going a little slow by the final third of the story (although one would expect a book about a lawyer to have a good deal of that) but should hang in all the way to the end. Your patience will be rewarded, not only by the conclusion, but also by the sample of THE DROP, the new Harry Bosch novel to be published in November.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I started with [[ASIN:B004H99QQ4 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire #1) by George R. R. Martin]] intending to finish that book before the HBO series started.  I quickly became caught up in the series and the world of Westeros living it with each page.  Each book I finished left me exhausted with not just the length, but the twist and turns, schemes and plots and I hesitated to begin the next knowing the journey that lay ahead.  Yet, each time I dove into the next book and not only finished \\"Game\\", but all of the series published to date.    I read the reviews of [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]] and dreaded reading this book because of them, considered skipping it.  Instead, I decided to skim the book in preparation of the publication of [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (Song of Ice and Fire)]].  I did not skim as intended.  I plowed through this one as I did the previous books.    Many have critizied the book for lacking focus on many of our favorite characters, so much so I expected to know no one.  Thank goodness this was not so.  Many of the characters are there and having read the previous books, most readers can realize that those who do not appear have something important going on elsewhere that we will find out about later.  The title of the first, \\"Game of Thrones\\" is a true description of this series.  The first three novels introduced us to the world, drew us in, let us know the characters, unveiled schemes and plots then hit us with the final pages just as a good clifthanger will, because; just as with life, there are no final resolutions.  \\"Feast\\" carries on that tradition taking us in directions we never expected yet, it may be giving us a glimpse of the \\"grand plan\\" ... or does it?.  I have to say, Martin has crafted this series as well as great mystery writers craft their best \\"who-dun-its\\".  What happens in \\"Feast\\" is as important to the overall story as the previous three books and having read it, I'm not sure how the series could have continued if \\"Feast\\" had not been written.    I'm looking forward to \\"Dance\\" and I can't wait for the HBO series to start.
B0043ISH6O|5.0|In the movie, the soundtrack sets the mood in a way that is hard to describe but distinctive. On the CD, the individual tracks are much longer and the listener is treated to a fuller realization of Trent Reznor's soundscapes. Anyone who has marveled at his sonic masterpieces like Downward Spiral and The Fragile knows what I mean. Really, how does he get so many sounds into one track, and all fitting into tight grooves? Two thumbs up for brilliance and style.

0930073207|5.0|I read Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt more than a year ago with my then 10-yr. old son. The knowledge in it is so profound that I've put off writing this review for fear that I could never do it justice, and I'm sure I haven't. But there's no time to wait - you need to read this book now.<br /><br />Having read a number of books about economics and banking, history and politics, I believe that Economics In One Lesson stands out as the most important book on the subject area.<br /><br />It is setup as a series of 23 different examples describing everyday occurrences to illustrate fundamental economic principles. How a broken window impacts the overall wealth of the community is among the most famous of these examples. Others address the value of public works projects, the importance of exports, the impact of taxation on production, the relationship of employment to the minimum wage and the inflationary result of printing money.<br /><br />Though written more than 50 years ago, the examples remain all too relevant today, unfortunately. In fact, for nearly every example, I was able to clip an article from the newspaper or print one from the Web documenting how the same issues are sadly alive today. \\"Price Controls Hamper Rise of Generics\\", Wall Street Journal, for example, revealed how the government of the Philippines set price controls on branded drugs to lower their cost only to find the artificially reduced profits caused retailers to cancel planned store openings and stop hiring. Hospitals raised other prices to recoup the loss of revenue from drugs and the once-growing generic drug manufacturing industry stalled since the spread between its prices and the now-lower branded drugs has been cut. Now there are more people unemployed and less medicine available. If only government officials in the Philippines had read this book before causing so much needless and predictable suffering.<br /><br />In \\"The New Cannery Row\\", for a second example, Wall Street Journal editors reveal what happened to the tuna industry in American Samoa when our Congress required the U.S. territory to raise its minimum wage from $3.26 an hour to $7.25 an hour by 2015. Well, what do you think happened? Chicken of the Sea closed its plant. StarKist cut more than half its workforce. Thousands were put out of work. The minimum wage hike pushed unemployment from 10% to 30%. Seems workers in Thailand are willing to clean fish for $.75 an hour. Since our Congress failed to grasp this, we get to send $18 million of our taxes to Samoa as compensation. Oops.<br /><br />Had our Congressmen read Hazlitt's analysis of each occurrence and his predictions for the outcomes of each occurrence under different economic policies they would've understood how raising and lowering the minimum wage affects employment. In fact, the answers to nearly every economic challenge that seems to confound everyone from TV talking heads to Federal Reserve members and the President's team of economic advisors are in this book, quickly and simply laid out for anyone to understand - regardless of a passing grade in Economics 101.<br /><br />In fact, the policy answers are so obvious that my 10-yr. old, upon noticing the \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" sticker on the cover, was baffled that the world could be in such economic chaos when the answers have been right here for 50 years. He'd thought we were reading a new book -it was unfathomable that most of our political leaders have ignored the obvious for so long while continually throwing money at policies that are proven to fail everywhere they've been implemented.<br /><br />After reading Economics In One Lesson, it's easy to see through all of the fear and hysteria driving today's pseudo-journalists on the news.  I highly recommend Economics In One Lesson.

B0000DJZ8R|2.0|We were not satisfied with this film.  There is a defect in the middle of the movie.  It pixelizes about 10-15 minutes making it very difficult to understand and watch. The remainder of the movie is good.  Would very much like to have it replaced.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is neither the most complex nor the most original film of the year, but this beautiful film stands out in that it requires the audience to have an attention span. The movie follows Prince Albert (Colin Firth), nicknamed Bertie, in Pre-World War II England as he attempts to overcome, or at least cope with, his stammer. His wife Her Royal Highness Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) recruits Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and so begins Bertie's unconventional path to Kinghood and self-acceptance.    Visuals are sometimes self-conscious and even cartoonish, but coloring is used to excellent effect. Lionel encourages Bertie to break away from social constraints, and his space is appropriately off-kilter, while the foreboding, increasingly dark shots of Bertie's surroundings have the effect of a vice. A stunning Colin Firth successfully conveys Bertie's vulnerability, which is made all the more harrowing because of his lack of self-pity. Geoffrey Rush complements Firth's performance and brings his delightful dialog to life as the alternately cheeky and tender Lionel.    Bertie's history of pain and stress is expressed in his body. The mechanical advice of physicians of the day falls flat, as does the advice to merely \\"relax.\\" Lionel offers a deeper connection, one which will likely inspire numerous viewers who have struggled with feelings of inadequacy and isolation. The film highlights the strict social structure as a source of damaging pressure. Bertie's life has almost no relationship to his struggling subjects, and yet the descriptions of his upbringing are horrifying. Lionel has a content family but, as an Australian, faces frequent prejudice. In spite of its heaviness, the film is quite funny as well. Bertie's dry sense of humor and Lionel's insouciance light up many a scene and amplify the more serious moments.    The two most interesting minor characters are Bertie's father King George V (Michael Gambon) and brother David(Guy Pearce), later King Edward VII, both of whom play a major role in Bertie's pathology. Gambon's George is a man with little patience for weakness, and Pearce's David is a silly, unfortunate product of his family.    Helena Bonham Carter does well with a less fleshed-out part. Lionel's wife (played by Jennifer Ehle) may be too perfect, but Lionel's and Bertie's families are portrayed with a light, lovely touch. Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall) is a purely positive and somewhat simplistic figure, and Archbishop Cosmo Lang (Derek Jacobi) is almost pure oiliness. Still, most characters are believable and very much of their time. Even the most progressive characters do not seem to be artificially implanted with modern ideas.    The horrors of World War I quietly hang over the characters, making the impending World War II all the more forboding. This might have been a more powerful film had it focused more on the threat ahead. Whatever the case, the painfully beautiful climax evokes a sense of both tragedy and victory and manages to be simultaneously heartrending and uplifting.    The King's Speech is less a political study than a poignant depiction of the power in treating another like a human being, even a king.
B002ZG9800|3.0|Here is my first review written earlier today followed by the one written this evening. My first review gives it one star because I hated it. However, we were watching it with teenagers and a very picky adult. After I wrote the first review and saw all the positive reviews, I put it on again to try to figure out what I was missing. Then came the second review.<br /><br />Suggestions are that you only watch it with people you are really comfortable with and definitely not with kids or teens!<br /><br />1. We watched this movie when we were vacationing in Myrtle beach: four adults, seven kids ranging in ages from 13 to 17. We all thought it was awful so I don't understand all the good reviews. Two of the adults walked out after the first 20 min, I finally left after an hour. And I am the type that watches suspenses and actions (often with violence as you cannot get a good action with no violence) with my kids.<br /><br />I found it to be crude, lots of vulgar lines which I cannot repeat here, explicit scenes that were supposed to be funny but weren't, and just plain terrible. Not funny at all.<br /><br />The film is based on a true story of Steven Russell, played by Jim Carrey, who transformed from small town married cop to gay conman. He ends up in jail and falls in love with one of the inmates, Phillip Morris played by Ethan Hawke, escapes from prison numerous times, all for Phillip who he will do anything for. I thought Ethan Hawke was ok but that Jim Carrey was terrible but it's hard to separate that from the awful lines.<br /><br />I really don't understand all the positive reviews. Even if we had watched it without kids, which I tried to do again last night, I still hated it.<br /><br />Not worth renting, watching, and definitely not worth buying, imho.<br /><br />2. I put the movie back on this evening and this time watched it alone. I can now see why it got good reviews. It was really uncomfortable when we were watching it with kids and my husband is really picky about movies. But being home recuperating from knee surgery gave me the time to try it again. And I have changed my opinion.<br /><br />After seeing it this evening, I could see why people raved about Jim Carrey's performance. He really is phenomenal in it. As is Ewan McGregor who played his part very well. It was interesting and it was touching and the story did hold my interest. When it ended, I thought to myself 'wow, that was actually a good movie'.<br /><br />But again, depends who you watch it with and your mood.e the time to try it again. And I have changed my opinion.

B003ZK58WM|4.0|This \\"\\"TOME\\" was a good story with the obvious theme of the futility of war.  Loved the characters, but I got bogged down with the details of battles and strategies of war.  Should have been about four hundred pages shorter.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Director Darren Aronofsky brilliantly explores the psychological landscape of one Nina Sayres (a perfect name for a ballet star) in his grand opus, \\"Swan Lake.\\" I give a standing ovation and five stars (actually four and one half but clicking five out of necessity)!<br /><br />This is a film seemingly about ballet, the ballet world and its backstabbing and jealousies. It's a film about competition, both individual and between individuals. It's about mother-daughter conflicts. It's about the power of a male boss over his female employees.<br /><br />However, \\"Swan Lake\\" is, foremost, the setting for a psychological thriller which details the mind of one character, Nina. She is the unfortunate daughter of a former ballet dancer who had to quit the business because of pregnancy. What this mother did was shift her failed dreams upon her hapless and weak daughter. Nina is not normal. It doesn't take the audience long to understand why and how.<br /><br />The star of the ballet \\"Swan Lake\\" can be danced by two women or by one with dual roles. The swans are dichotomous: one pure, virginal, innocent; the other evil, passionate, sensual. Nina is the perfect white swam, but the director wants to choose someone to dance both roles. Because of her perfect technique, Nina finally wins the role with a promise to the director and his own determination that she will, indeed, be a great black swan and all it implies.<br /><br />But, alas, Nina is sooooo conflicted, so conflicted, in fact, that she is hallucinating. That old man on the subway is not making lewd gestures toward her.  Because her single focus in life is ballet, she has repressed, unknowingly, her needs and desires. Repression can behave in bizarre ways.<br /><br />Once she earns the role, Nina's repression causes more problems than hallucinations. A rash breaks out. She peels pieces of flesh from her fingers, only to discover that she didn't. A new dancer tries to befriend Nina. Finally, in a confrontation with her mother, she chooses the friend and goes out to party. Influenced by drugs and alcohol and a loosening of her inhibitions, Nina hallucinates a big one: She and the friend have a passionate sex scene.<br /><br />And so it goes. This is Nina, reaching the climax of her life--the epitome. She has already watched what happens to an aging star who previously danced this role. It's an ugly scenario. She lives with a mother who is bitter because she could no longer dance. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Nina finally pierces her core to find what it takes to dance the Black Swan and wins a standing ovation. At what cost?<br /><br />I would like to leave my review at the previous paragraph, but I cannot. I accepted the director's use of surreal hallucinations as realistic, coming from a very repressed, rigid mindset with one single purpose in life: to dance. What I cannot accept is the act that pulls the passion from Nina's deepest self to win highest accolades from the director and the audience. Aronofsky made me accept Nina's pitiful existence and the deranged visions, but not the final physical act. Nope.<br /><br />Does Natalie Portman deserve her Academy award? It is certainly a performance worthy of the award. To maintain that magnitude of fear and even terror and repression and uncertainty over the weeks of filming is surely a feat of willpower in itself. In today's market of many very talented female actors, I don't know if Portman is THE one. Not having seen the other movies yet, I cannot be definitive, but Portman as Nina is certainly a contender.out to party. Influenced by drugs and alcohol and a loosening of her inhibitions, Nina hallucinates a big one: She and the friend have a passionate sex scene.    And so it goes.

I accepted the director's use of surreal hallucinations as realistic, coming from a very repressed, rigid mindset with one single purpose in life: to dance. What I cannot accept is the act that pulls the passion from Nina's deepest self to win highest accolades from the director and the audience. Aronofsky made me accept Nina's pitiful existence and the deranged visions, but not the final physical act. Nope.     Does Natalie Portman deserve her Academy award? It is certainly a performance worthy of the award. To maintain that magnitude of fear and even terror and repression and uncertainty over the weeks of filming is surely a feat of willpower in itself. In today's market of many very talented female actors, I don't know if Portman is THE one. Not having seen the other movies yet, I cannot be definitive, but Portman as Nina is certainly a contender.

B003EYVXTG|1.0|If Disney made a movie about severe poverty, drugs, and violence it would be just like Winters Bone.  Everyone keeps talking about how bleek and dark the film is, but that's really only because of the setting, back drop, and weather throughout.  The story itself is actually quite sappy, corny, and laughable.  To start with, we have a violent, drug addicted uncle who for the first half of the movie is abusive towards our main actress, he's violent towards her, attempts to get her to snort some meth, and even appears as if he just might molest his 17-year-old niece....but then.....presto...by the end of the film he's bring little baby chicks to the other children and he's sweet as pie.  Awww, he's even called \\"tear drop\\", because deep down he's a good guy.    Then, we have our bail bondsman.  An evil, slimey critter during the first half of the film who then (out of the goodness of his bail bondsman heart) gives our actress a sack -o- cash at the end, which will allow her to dip that squirrel meat in caviar for the rest of her life!!  We additionally have a group of sea hag women who beat, slap, and kick our main actress...drag her into a barn where other violent meth dealers are hanging out.  They, out of the goodness of their meth dealer hearts...let the girl go despite the fact she can implicate them all in a murder if she keeps snooping around.  Then, later, the sea hags return and are sweet as pie and could not be more helpful really.    The only charactor who didn't pull a 180 and become a good decent person, was...of course...the cop.  What a shocker, an evil sheriff who has no decency in him whatsoever.  So, the meth dealers are really good folk but the cops are bad. It's no surprise the Academy loves this tripe, cough Crash cough. It's essentially a Disney tale of a girl looking for her father, and a town who initially resists her every effort...but then...they go soft and provide her all the help she needs to become rich and we all ride off into the sunset holding hands smiling.  Gag

Did I fall asleep as Matthew and Ysabeau announced they had decided to use the English spelling of their French surname?  Or is this laziness on the part of the author and/or editor?

I want to order five or ten more as I am giving these to friends who can benefit from the study done by Dr. Campbell.  If everyone would take to heart and follow the research he has done and eat only a plant protein based diet there would be far less illness than there is now. It is not hard and certainly a lot more healthy.  I credit this knowledge as lifesaving for me. I was being treated in a clinical trial for malignant melanoma, and as I changed vigorously to a totally vegan diet  I have had no more metastasis.
030746363X|5.0|I don't hop on very many band wagons, in fact most of the time I think that when you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect (I think it was Mark Twain who said that), but in the case of the 4-hour body, this is one band wagon I'm proud to be on (and one of the few times I find the majority agreeing with me).    The 4 Hour Body is the kind of book that I would have written (I'm a Master Herbalist and health educator) if I'd had the patience to do so. I have already used some of the techniques in the book with great success and am looking forward to more of the same.    BTW: Regarding the early testimonials, it's common practice to send out advance copies of a book before it hits the presses so you can include testimonials on the book cover and in marketing pieces, like you've probably seen on 90% of all the books published in the last few decades.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|NB: THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE KINDLE EDITION ALONE!  This is a great book, and I've eaten up the series and have been on tenterhooks for George RR to get his finger out and publish A Dance with Dragons for YEARS now.  (And the tv series!! Be still my beating heart!!!)  But I have to comment on the extremely bad editing of the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones.  It is sloppy and unprofessional.  When I first got my kindle, I never experienced this, but now it seems like every book gets worse and worse.  I thought Sacajawea was bad, but A Game of Thrones starts out with poor editing and gets progressively more appalling as you get further into the book.  People who only read the kindle edition will think that Princess Elia comes from Dome, since that is how it is (almost) consistently spelled throughout the book.  (It's Dorne).  But on the other hand, the `tom cat' is a `torn cat'- go figure.  Little things like that at first, but now, in the last third of the book, the mistakes are coming on nearly every page.  Random parentheses, inappropriately capitalized words, italics that make no sense, sentences that end abruptly - that kind of thing.  It would be irritating, but something I would just accept in a free edition of a book (maybe).  But for a Kindle book that costs more than the paperback, I expect more.  I also own a hard copy of this book, and none of these typos are in that edition.  I'm not sure how the Kindle editions are made, but I expect the same kind of professional editing that you get in print books.  You don't get that here, disappointingly.

1400052181|5.0|Skloot has done an amazing job at detailing the tortured history of Henrietta and the Lacks family with great efficiency, compassion, and objective reporting.  Although she has a great knowledge of science, she simplifies the difficult genetic and molecular nature of the HeLa cells and the ethical/legal issues that ensue such that the average reader can understand.  There is so much to learn from this book (history, science, law, American cultural studies and civil rights) and she transitions very smoothly between each subject to keep the reader engaged.  The picture inserts of the family add a touch of reality as well.  Her writing is fantastic, her own role in the Lacks' family story is modest, and her devotion to the subject matter is unmatched.  Any reader who takes on this story will not regret it.
1608191664|4.0|23 Things is as addictive as potato chips: read one Thing and you'll be compelled to read the next. Some of the things Chang talks about in this book are:      There's no such thing as a free market--all markets are under the influence of regulations of some kind, yet we may take them so much for granted that we don't even recognize they're in effect. For example, at one time there were big debates about child labor (and slavery). \\"Children should have the right to work,\\" etc. Now it's unthinkable to have children forgo education so that corporations can exploit their cheap labor.     The entire idea of shareholders, where investors can get in and out of company very fast with a quick profit, is bad for the long term stability of companies and countries. Workers actually care more about the long-term stability of a company than do shareholders because the workers' livelihoods depend on the survival of their company.     Regulations can and do help societies and often protect companies against their own self-cannibalistic natures.  For example, though short-term profit-seeking fishermen may fish a species to extinction, putting themselves out of work in the long run and diminishing the quality of life on the planet, government regulations can keep the fishermen from over-fishing, keeping both the industry and the species alive in perpetuity.      We do not live in a post-industrial age. As one can see from our ever-increasing trade deficit, we depend more on the products other countries manufacture than they depend on our knowledge services.     Big government can actually help a market adapt to changes more rapidly. \\"A well-designed welfare state can actually encourage people to take chances with their jobs and be more, not less, open to changes. This is one reason why there is less demand for trade protectionism in Europe than in the US. . . . Americans know that losing their current jobs may mean a huge fall in their living standards, [the loss of their health care], and may even be the end of their productive lives.\\"     And both Chang and my economics textbooks agree: developing countries have not done better with free-market globalization.     I highly recommend this book. The reason I am only giving it four stars is that I am tired of progressive economists continuing to support the basic concept of capitalism, as if a few band-aids will heal the corrupt kernel of the capitalist philosophy. I am currently a student taking both micro- and macro-economics. Both of my teachers rail daily against the abuses in the free market system. (Every day seems to bring new news of a new corporate outrage.) Yet both continue to support the basic idea of capitalism (or free markets). Chang is like this, too. He points out flaw after flaw after flaw and yet still supports the concept of profit seeking. I think it's high time for a philosophical shift from the concept of personal gain/profit to global gain/profit. If we eliminate individual advantage and disadvantage we eliminate the motivation to lie, cheat, steal, pollute the environment, etc. If we all have the same, and if we don't gain unless everyone does, then there is no motivation to do bad, there is only motivation to improve things. We would not require endless regulations because there'd be no individual gain, there'd be no reason to lie, cheat, steal, defraud, etc. As long as you have individual gain and disadvantage you will have an environment where abuses are constant and conflict is never-ending and you will never ever be able to keep up with the new tricks that capitalists can invent.

B0046W1692|5.0|Para mí, el álbum nuevo de MANÁ es evocadora de las canciones impresionantes en los discos \\"Cuando Los Ángeles Lloran\\"; \\"Sueños Líquidos\\"; y \\"Revolución De Amor.\\"    Experimentan con arreglos de orquesta--de los cuáles algunos dirán que esto causa que el disco sea demasiado  \\"formal\\", \\"estructurado\\", o \\"lento\\" en comparación a los trabajos previos de la banda.  Yo entendería eso--extraño a los talentos guitarrísticos rigurosos de Sergio en este disco.  Sin embargo, esto no quita de las baladas hermosas que encandilan a \\"Drama y Luz.\\"  Si usted necesita escuchar canciones particulares para deducir sus propias opiniones hacia el disco, escuchen \\"Vuela Libre Paloma\\"; \\"El Dragón\\"; y \\"El Espejo.\\"      Yo sentía que \\"Amar Es Combatir\\" no fue el mejor esfuerzo de la banda.  Pero \\"Drama y Luz\\" definitivamente es otro rollo, hecho evidente por la calidad de la música al igual como el DVD incluido en el Deluxe Edition.    Entre todo, \\"Drama y Luz\\" es un logro triunfante--uno de los mejores discos del año, y entre los experimentos más finos de la carrera artística de MANÁ.      ********************************      To me, the new MANÁ album is reminiscent of songs that made \\"Cuando Los Ángeles Lloran\\"; \\"Sueños Líquidos\\"; & \\"Revolución de Amor\\" so awesome.    They experiment with orchestral arrangements--which some might say makes the album too \\"formal\\", \\"structured\\", or \\"slow\\" in a way that doesn't allow them to let loose as they have on other albums.  I can see that--I definitely miss Sergio's glaring guitar solos on this album.  Regardless, that doesn't take away from the beautiful ballads that have made their way onto \\"Drama y Luz.\\"  If you need any convincing about whether or not to pick up this album and wish to listen to single tracks, check out \\"Vuela Libre Paloma\\"; \\"El Dragon\\"; and/or \\"El Espejo.\\"    I felt \\"Amar Es Combatir\\" was not an album on which they gave it their all.  \\"Drama y Luz\\" is a VERY different story, made evident by the qualityof music as well as the DVD they packed into the Deluxe Edition.      All in all, \\"Drama y Luz\\" is a triumphant achievement--one of the best albums of the year, and among the finest experiments in MANÁ's musical career.

B0000CABBW|5.0|Oh my goodness this is such a great movie and inspirational. This little girl brought the value of individuals in the community back into everyones lives. Loved it![[ASIN:B0000CABBW Whale Rider]]
0385341008|5.0|This is one of those books that you race through the first time to find out what happens, and then settle down to read it many more times to savor how it gets there.<br /><br />It is simultaneously the story of:<br />-- villagers who evolve into a community only by accident<br />-- soulmates who find each other<br />-- literature and its power<br />-- how people cope with isolation, deprivation, subjugation, and fear<br />-- a little-known historical event from WW II<br />-- the horrors of war<br /><br />This is the best book I've read in years. Not only is it told in my favorite literary style, epistolary, it's historically accurate, informative, engaging, powerful, and uplifting. It tells the story of the 5-year German occupation of the British Channel Islands during WW II, during which the residents were completely cut off from the outside world.<br /><br />Can you imagine sending your children away to strangers in an attempt to keep them safe, and then not knowing even whether they made it to their destination, for 5 long years? That's just one of the things going on in this book. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|This is one of those 'formula' movies. Did I really just say that? Well, trust me it is. And all the characters are here too. I mean, you have the cocky handsome guy--insert Jake here. Along with the gutsy, independent girl (who happens to be a knockout)--see Anne there.    I mean, who wouldn't go for this coupling? They're two very attractive and likeable people. And they have chemistry pouring out of...well, their pores. (Note to Jake and Anne: Are the two of you guys SURE you don't want to go out on a date? I think I'm seeing something here that could very well possibly translate to real life.) Just a thought?    Anyway, my thoughts on this film is that it's very likeable in that 'sweet light-hearted' way that you'd want a 'sweet light-hearted' film like this to be.    Oh yeah, and the Anne Hathaway character has Parkinsons.    Don't worry, it's not dealt with in the serious way that a movie like this wouldn't even deserve. It's just put out there to show Anne as this really 'aw shucks' determined kind of person. Who no matter what, is going to be beautiful and strong and sexy and everything else that everybody on the planet wishes they could be too.    And I think as the movie goes along, it does a good job in showing the growth in the characters. I mean at first Maggie (Anne's character) only wants to have all this 'free sex' with none of the strings because I'm guessing she doesn't want her potential suitors to be around when her illness starts to go south.    And you get to see the Jamie character (Jake) slowly turn into this person who just doesn't want to have mindless sex either. Because as the story goes along, it's like they only want to be together.  And in the movie, you can see how this relationship is slowly forged. Even if it's in spite of itself.    All in all, this is a really nice movie with really nice actors. What I appreciated MORE than anything, is the chemistry that the characters Jamie and Maggie had. The chemistry I'm thinking that Jake and Anne gave them. [This is what I'd call good acting or maybe it wasn't--OK, so I'm pushing for the Jake Gyllenhaal/Anne Hathaway pairing again.  : ) ]    Anyway, I think if you're looking for a nice, romantic 'dramedy', then this is the one to see. I know I'm glad I did!
B001TH8UUA|1.0|I bought the cable and it worked for about a year. Now it is giving me lots of troubles. My BD player goes in an HDMI error often. I usually have to stop a movie 2-3 times to unplug the HDMI cable and plug it back in to get picture and sound. I guess \\"you get what you pay for!\\"
0439023513|3.0|The trilogy as a whole has some great ideas and characters, albeit bleak. I enjoyed reading these books and read each one within a day. Lucky for me, all three were readily available and I didn't have to wait, given the cliffhanger endings. Definitely didn't see some of the plot twists coming. I liked how the issues were not presented as black and white - **spoilers** that some of the tributes were eager to be there and to participate while others despised it; that District 13 wasn't a Utopia that was all rainbows and sunshine; that just because they defeated the Capitol didn't mean that everything would be perfect.    **more spoilers ahead**  However, I do find issue with a few things. For me, Mockingjay might be the weakest of the three books. Katniss has been strong from the beginning, rising to the occasion to protect those she loves, but in Mockingjay seems to lose herself. This issue has been discussed pretty well in other reviews and comments and I agree that she does seem to regress. She is only there to react to other people and to be used, letting other people dictate her life. I don't mind that she was basically considered a soldier and a figurehead for the rebellion, but just a few lines to show an awareness and acceptance of this would have gone a long way. Something to indicate her being in control or being proactive.     Why bother with the love triangle at all? I was rooting for Gale from the beginning (childhood friends and all) and was hoping to see him more fully fleshed out in Mockingjay, but he wasn't. It's pretty clear then, who Collins favors and sees Katniss ending up with. Is there a point to the triangle then? I think just her struggling with her feelings for Peeta and not wanting to be in a relationship would have been enough. I also found it unsatisfying how Collins wound up the whole Gale issue with him just living in another district.    I really think if Collins had taken the time to write just a little bit more about certain characters and situations, I would have been more moved and also rated the book higher. For example, I honestly wasn't that saddened by Prim's death. Given her importance to Katniss, Collins could have spent more time developing Prim's character.     The following isn't an issue, but I just found it sad that Haymitch went back to drinking again after being forced to sober up so many times. After learning more about the aftermath of the Hunger Games, that being the winner wasn't so hunky dory, I can see why he needed the escape.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I became a fan of Joss Whedon.  His sci-fi/western gem, \\"Firefly\\" is the main reason.  Each of his stories, by turns funny and exciting, immersed me in a world of fantasy at the end of which left me wanting to hear the next tale.  The characters, and their colorful language, the intermixing of English and Mandarin just made it that much better.  When the show was canceled, long before its time I believe, I was pretty disappointed.  But that is all in the past. All we can do now, is purchase collections of the complete series, such as this one.      This three disc Blu-Ray collection of the entire fourteen series episodes of Firefly includes some deleted scenes, outtakes, interviews with the creators, producers, writers and actors, gag reels, and some great behind-the-scenes featurettes. There is even some footage of the actors from when they attended a Comic Con event.  Of course each episode can be played from beginning to end, but you can also skip to those never-to-be-forgotten scenes you remember fondly. I found the on-screen controls a tiny bit cumbersome to navigate, but that may have been due to all that beer I had been drinking at the time.    Nevertheless, this is a collection well worth having. If you are a Firefly aficionado you should definitely pick up a copy for yourself.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is the best Foo Fighters album yet.  I've been a fan for more than 10 years and Wasting Light incorporates things from all of their albums into one.  I'm pretty picky on CDs and normally I never listen to an entire CD from start to finish.  I've listened to Wasting Light eight times, and I can't find anything bad about it.  Every song is awesome.  This album will be around for years to come, and will likely be remembered as a classic.  A must have for any rock fan.
B0034G4OY0|5.0|The hostility towards this movie is astonishing.

9063692560|4.0|A good introduction to the fairly new field of \\"Service Design\\", this book is more a less a motivation to start doing things. Through interesting case studies and short articles by various contributors, many aspects of Service Design are brought forward, followed up by a section dedicated to the tools service designers use within their profession.     Especially this section makes the book valuable to me as it presents in print an overview of many methods and tools that may be encountered 'in the wild' during projects, all laid out in the book in such a way that it is easy to use them on-site during sessions or meetings.    I think that for the academic reader the book will perhaps not dive deep enough into the discourse about the value and meaning of Service Design (and Design Thinking), but I definitely recommend this book to people that are working within the field or are interested in the subject. The practical and concise approach stimulates the reader to apply the mentioned tools within own projects and use the case studies to get inspiration.
044654759X|3.0|Lately, it seems Mr. Sparks is treading water. Maybe I've just outgrown him. Maybe he should stick to screenplays since that's where the money is and that's how he seems to be writing his novels lately.    I haven't necessarily enjoyed every book he's ever written, but there have been a few that stand out. I enjoyed Message in a Bottle and Dear John. However, I'm beginning to wonder what's so great about his writing these days.    I found Safe Haven slow, plodding and, my goodness, I honestly found most of the book boring and repetitious, especially where Kevin, Erin's husband, comes in. I did appreciate the relationship between Katie and Alex, that they were taking time to get to know each other. I'm weary of the jumping to the next intimate level so quickly after introductions. Anyway, simply didn't warm up to this book, or the characters, at all. It was not a \\"I can't put it down\\" read. Matter of fact, I had to force myself to finish it. When I have to do that, I know I'm not involved. I found the ending contrived and just plain too fantastical. While I enjoy a nice twist,and I'm all for things of a Heavenly nature, it just felt twisted the way Sparks worked it.    Also, I guess I'm just tired of the beautiful woman/man who everyone can't take their eyes off of. Why can't a woman/man be OK but there's an essence about her/him that draws people. I'm tired of the beautiful people descriptions. Surely writers can use their imaginations to work believable characters, especially along the romance line, who are ordinary yet extraordinary?     If you're a fan of Nicholas Sparks regardless of what he puts out, you'll most definitely feel rewarded. If you've always been lukewarm to the monotony he can often write up,I'd suggest steering clear.

0439023521|4.0|I was not at all interested in reading this book based on the story summary.  Last summer it was on the summer reading list for my about-to-be 6th grader and during the school year he read it.  He liked the book and since we have read a number of series together and I like to read the books he's reading, I read it recently.  It was very compelling reading and I read the entire series in just over a week.  I thought the books were very well written, but I am very surprised they were recommended by our school for 11 and 12 year olds. The entire series is very violent with plenty of disturbing passages - I had a number of nightmares resulting from the books.  I would recommend the series, but with reservations.
B000W93CHC|2.0|A long long long book that basically went nowhere.  No great characters, no great action, just historical fiction (which I generally love) that was worse than its precurser \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"  what was Ken Follett thinking?

B004RE29PO|4.0|This is my blu-ray review for \\"Aliens\\" from the Alien Trilogy set. Anyone who has seen \\"Aliens\\" a million times like me knows that it is a VERY grainy film. I blame this on the film stock used at the time.  I will try to give you a fair/balanced review without getting too much in detail. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film DID look better then I expected on blu-ray. (And no!...you can't always expect a blu-ray to look better).  I assume the film I'm viewing will be the same as the single blu-ray \\"Aliens' which will be released in the near future. I know I wanted all four of them so I bought the whole thing.  Yes!....I frowned on Alien 3 for many years to later REALLY like and respect it. Alien-Resurrection being the worst of the set and even it \\"got better\\" over the years. Will you see grain in Aliens?....most certainly yes!...three areas mostly that I saw....1. When Ripley is rescued (opening of the movie: the outer shuttle shot looks great, it's the inner shot where the salvage team comes in).....2. When Ripley is waking up at Gateway Station.....3. Where she is sitting at the garden bench waiting for Burk before the inquest wanting information about her daughter.  Other then these three areas I found grain to be at a minimum. It seemed like the film improved as I got further into it.  Some of the grain could be where the added footage for the extended version was cut in. I found grain most of the time where I wouldn't expect to see it and didn't see it where I held my breath knowing I was going to see it. The very few space shots of the Sulaco and the tactical landing craft are for the most part clear as a bell (these being the  darker shots you would expect to see grain). There are scenes where you are simply amazed at the clarity (given what you're used to seeing).  Flesh surfaces look rather good..not fantastic....I did notice surface texture (metal, fabric, hair, flesh) details more and could actually read nomenclature tags clear. I don't remember  watching the dvd and being able to do so.  I did notice the tactical landing craft wing lights were very sharp and clear as well as on the top of the air making facility tower. Anyone who has apprehensions to spending the money for a blu-ray version rest easy.  You will not be disappointed.

0521008433|4.0|Any publication with J Richards are bound to be good ones, this is just another great gift from him along with Rodgers. It gives a nice overview, as per the title, of methods in language teaching. I would suggest ordering this book if you are new to TESOL, of have been in the language teaching area but lack (and crave) building of your academic background in this area. I do like Stevick's [[ASIN:0883771470 Teaching Languages: A Way and Ways (Methodology)]] as it is slightly more comprehensive.<br /><br />Personally - I would add both to your cart if you are shopping for this genre of book.

B004DN3VEM|3.0|Disc One contains the \\"New York mix\\" and the \\"Los Angeles mix\\" of the album. Between the two versions, the tracks differ only a few seconds in length so I couldn't hear any differences when playing each mix through sequentially. In comparing the individual tracks, you can hear that the New York mix is brighter, and there are some effects in the New York mix that are not in the LA mix. Out of the two, I prefer the LA mix because of its warmer, thicker sound field. The New York mix is the one that was used for the album and frankly, the 1999 remaster sounds way better in my opinion.     Disc Two contains the \\"Rough Mix\\" of Rising along with one live rehearsal track. I'm assuming that the \\"Rough Mix\\" tracks are the same Cozy Powell tracks that have been floating around as a bootleg for the last few years. There are some notably difference in the \\"Rough Mix\\" which include a keyboard into to \\"Stargazer\\" and a longer outro to \\"Run With The Wolf\\". The last track is a live rehearsal of \\"Stargazer\\" that is bootleg quality.    Honestly I had hoped for better from this Deluxe Edition, some extra track would have been nice. While it is interesting to hear the differences in mixes, especially for die hard fans, newcomers are better off sticking with the single disc version.    The cd should get 5 stars for the music, but I am giving less stars due to the quality of the remastering and the value of the package.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|This cd is spectacular.  It has the sound and feel of their live shows.  There is tremendous energy.  This cd sounds better than their studio album.  I recommend this to anyone that likes music, period.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|great movie, saw it three times in theaters. if you saw it once, you already knew if you were gonna get the dvd. having a combo pack is actually pretty neat, even if the digital copy is worthless for everyone without an iPhome.
0525421580|5.0|We read this book for my Young Adult Literature class in University, and I have to say it was one of my favorite books by far. It's a great piece to study in regards to both how modern young adult literature functions as a craft, as well as how two writers can make not only a completely coherent story, but one as charming and lovable as Will Grayson, Will Grayson.<br /><br />The modern setting is emphasized by implementation of themes important to contemporary young adults, including gay and straight relations, love, and music. Both Green and Levithan are highly aware of what adolescents are experiencing these days, and this book will grab you by the short hairs and make you love every bit of it. The musical-esque feel of the piece is somewhat reminiscent of High School Musical or Glee, except this book is actually good. I hate those shows, and I loved this book, so I can only imagine the kind of fangirl/boy excitement that would take place if you actually enjoyed musicals while reading this (one of the central themes of the plot is a student-run musical).<br /><br />It's just a fun book to read and it's got a lot of depth if you're looking for that too. Need I say more?
B004ODLUF8|1.0|Dont know whats wrong with Warner Bros recent DVD releases. The transfers are unsuitable for display on large screens, exhibiting macro-blocking and pixelation. This one will be relegated to the shelf along with: Sherlock Holmes, Inception, and Legend of the Guardians. Yes, it took 4 purchases to see the pattern.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|X-Men: The Last Stand is the exactly the kind of finale to the trilogy that you would expect if you've seen the others. stripped down plots cobbled together from the long history of x-men comics with small appearances by notable characters. but there are some nice bits too.     plot-wise, if you are a fan of the comics and are hoping the film will be true to them than you're probably going to be disappointed. it's not that the story is bad necessarily... just not good. one gets the feeling they didn't know exactly where they wanted to go with it or what they wanted to say and everything they did say was already done to satisfaction in the previous movies. however, to be fair, coming up with a finale to an x-men series, that works, is extraordinarily difficult. considering the massive amounts of story arcs, characters, and the fact that the actual story isn't going to end anytime soon... this isn't the worst job they could have done. overall, while it doesn't work remarkably well, it's a decent film.    on the other hand, where this film really distinguishes itself (and indeed the whole trilogy for the most part) is it's casting choices. half the appeal of a comic book adaptation is seeing your favorite characters portrayed in a live-action presentation and, in this, the film succeeds remarkably. Kelsey Grammer is wonderful and very fitting as The Beast, Vinnie Jones does a smashing job as the Juggernaut, and whoever came up with casting Ellen Page as Kitty Pride should be given a medal. her performance is probably one of the only really outstanding things about this film. of course the other actors from the previous films do great jobs too and seem to really want to bring their characters to life (especially Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart). unfortunately, the script and story just doesn't give them much to work with.     basically, as long as you aren't looking for anything amazingly faithful to the original idea and come expecting a hollywood interpretation, it'sa fine film. not mind-blowing or astonishing but not a disaster either.
B002N2XHXU|5.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah is an amazing and inspirational story. The memoir describes the journey of a young boy named Ismael Beah that grew up around the terrors of African child soldiers and how he overcame the horrors of war and made a life for himself. Ishmael Beah writes about his own events growing up with his family in Mogbwemo, to being involved in the war with other child soldiers to escaping the war terrors to being a spokesperson in America. Ismael Beah is the main character of the book that comes in contact with many people along with family, friends and even fellow soldiers. He is the person who narrates the story and tells the story through his eyes along with all the thoughts about what he was experiencing. He wants to inform the people who did not know about the war conditions in Africa and the number of child soldiers that resulted from the war. These child soldiers were put upfront in the war and forced to lose their innocence when they had to see killings and murders of hopeless bystanders and even their own friends. They were forced to work themselves hard and even be influenced by drugs and belligerent officers. These children had nothing to fight for but themselves because most of them were separated from their families and they had to fight for their own survival in the times of crisis.  The book is solely based on real events in Africa including Sierra Leone's civil war from 1991 to 2001. Children being forced to go to war to be soldiers based on the conditions in their country resulting from war are common and not only found in Africa like Ismael Beah informed us about. These horrible conditions for children soldiers are found all over the world. I do agree with Ismael Beah that it is important to inform the world about conflicts that affected these kids and get people to make a difference. It is important to inform others about conflicts that are happening, especially one about child soldiers that have to survive in such harsh conditions so that people will not be indifferent and actually take a stand against the harsh things that happened in Africa. He describes the crisis during a conference when he says \\"I am from Sierra Leone, and the problem that is affecting us children is the war that forces us to run away from our homes, lose our families, and aimlessly roam the forest\\" which shows the horrible events that result from the war and how they need to be discussed to make a difference and change the lives of people and children so they do not have to endure these harsh conditions. Ismael Beah says himself \\"It seems we were transforming our sufferings as we talked about ways to solve their causes and let them be known to the world.\\" He realizes the threats of all these events that he had to experience himself and he wishes to inform the world about so no one else has too. His passion for a change is inspirational and uplifting. A Long way Gone did not exactly leave me asking many questions but more intrigued as to what happened to Ismael Beah. He did an amazing job with describing the events going on during the war so I was not confused about any topics. If I had a question it would be what caused the civil war in Sierra Leone. Ismael Beah did not leave me hanging since it was a memoir so you were just hoping for the best for him. The book made me attached to him and made me hope for a successful journey to New York. I would definitely recommend this book for everyone to read. This book is so informative and inspirational that you will never want to put down the book. His character is so pure and caring even though the terrors happening around him, he still never loses himself and keeps pushing forward for the best for himself. I would recommend this book to others so they can be inspired by his words as much as I was. This book is an inspirational story about an amazing journey that is worth the read.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary of Robert McNamara and was actually quite surprised at some of the things he said.  I found his \\"lessons\\" that he learned as a result of his experiences during WWII, while at Ford, and then later as SECDEF and the chief architect of America's involvement in Vietnam to be quite insightful.   However, it is unfortunate that those lessons learned as a result of mistakes made during the Vietnam War were at such a high cost to this country. This was McNamara's way of warning us that we should not make those same mistakes again.   I highly recommend \\"The Fog of War\\" and I hope that those who watch will take his lessons to heart.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Twas an amazing movie, I have never seen such an anime this good before. It's a must see to all anime fans, those fans of Evagelion and those new to the series. I also recommend on buying Evangelion 2.22.

B003Y5H5KQ|5.0|\\"Hanna?\\" Is awesome. That is all the review you need. GO SEE IT NOW!!!<br /><br />Seriously, prepare to be amazed. I think this film appeals to everyone, whether you are into action films or indie art films, or both. Hanna (played brilliantly by the young Saoirse Ronan) was raised in the forest by her father (Eric Bana). She has never had any contact with the outside world, and although she is quite intelligent, she is oblivious to many aspects of life. For example, she has never seen a television or heard music...and she doesn't really understand what she's missing out on. Hanna has also been raised as a soldier, and has been being groomed for a mission: her father wants her to murder an American agent (the always incredible Cate Blanchett) who killed her mother. Anxious to leave the forest, fulfill her responsibility, and get on with her life, Hanna embarks on a crazy and dangerous journey that will take her across Europe as she fights for her survival and discovers the secrets of her past.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie. It isn't cliche in any way. The pacing is great throughout the film, and I was deeply engrossed in the story from beginning to end. The acting is superb (LOVE Cate Blanchett's American accent!) and the cinematography is fantastic. There are so many great scenes and sequences that are unique and energized and so different from traditional films. It's a real pleasure to watch. The many fight scenes and the final scenes at the carnival are especially fantastic. I suppose my only gripe is that you don't really get an epilogue of what happens after the final scene, but I'm the kind of person who hates having any loose ends in a movie, and I realize that not everyone is like that, so this may not bother everyone.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Hanna\\" is awesome. You'll want to see this one in the theatre.
B000FA5MUI|3.0|I enjoy post apocalyptic novels by a variety of authors, thus Cat's Cradle was recommended to me. I had heard Vonnegut wrote strange stuff and this being the first novel I have read of his, I have to agree. Bizarre.    This is written in first person by a survivor in a world that ended quite strangely, almost by the author's own hand. Brief chapters describe the survivor's pre-apocalyptic encounters with folks he is interviewing for facts for a biography he is preparing to write. Little seems to actually happen until the last few short chapters when everything goes south in a hurry and in a big way.    The only reason I kept reading this book was because it was so odd I couldn't think of what possibly might happen next...
0316098337|5.0|This novel encapsulates that fine line of tragedy and endearment.  I wasn't too excited when I first bought the book.  I read the description on amazon, and reading a story about an imprisoned girl seemed disturbing and horrifying.  The only reason I bought it was the fact that it was written in a child's voice and thought it would be interesting.  Let me tell you...Boy, did I get the surprise of a literary lifetime!  I haven't read such a moving story in a long time, and it is not simply a story about survival, but about relationships, the world, the meaning of childhood, and life in general.  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  The characters stay within me as a good novel should.  I think about Jack while doing everyday things, and his thoughts stay in mine.  I would recommend this book wholeheartedly!
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I just purchased these shoes in the Olive canvas in a 7, which is the size that I wear for most ballerina flats. However, THEY WERE TOO SMALL!!! On the website it suggests ordering a 1/2 size smaller, but I would suggest a 1/2 size smaller than the largest size that you wear! I on average wear an 8 in most sneakers and a 7.5 in heels and a 7 in flip flops or flats. I could jam my foot into the 7's and thought that with some stretching they would get better but eventually faced the fact that with my toe pressed against the fabric in the front, I would very soon have a hole there. I am giving this pair away and just ordered another pair a half size larger. :-) Hope this helped in deciding what size to get, because I know I was very confused when I purchased!
B00005JMAH|1.0|I ordered this DVD twice and both times recieved the wrong edition. What you think you're ordering is a 2 Disc Widescreen version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. What you actually recieve is a 1 disc full screen version, that's english and french (clearly a Canadian product). When I informed customer service the first time they said they would ship me a corrected order, but again I recieved the wrong version. When I contacted them a second time they were unable to correct my order, but have kept the product open. WARNING - if you purchase this you will not recieve a 2 disc widescreen product!
B0029LHWFO|5.0|What really motivates Barack Obama is an inherited rage--an often masked, but profound rage that comes from his African father; an anticolonialist rage against Western dominance, and most especially against the wealth and power of the very nation Barack Obama now leads. It is this rage that explains the previously inexplicable, and that gives us a startling look at what might lie ahead (c)      \\"It is this world, a world where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of Port-au-Prince see in a year, where white folks' greed runs a world in need, apartheid in one hemisphere, apathy in another hemisphere...That's the world! On which hope sits!\\"   ~ Barack Hussein Obama, Dreams from My Father       Not only is Obama a Marxist, he's also racist to his bones.     Just remember that Obama sat for 20 years in a Marxist-inspired, Black Liberation Theology church and listened to his friend, close confidante and pastor Jeremiah Wright deliver one anti-Semitic, racist diatribe sermon after another.     Then Obama said he was unaware of the hate-filled sermons. One must suppose that he was sleeping under the pew during these 20 years of \\"sermons.\\"     To say it beggars belief is a massive understatement. But millions of voters with an IQ somewhere south of that of a head of lettuce believed him and trotted off to the ballot boxes to vote for him.     Barack Obama is a malevolent Marxist cockroach. His mission is the total destruction of America so that it can be \\"transformed\\" into hard left socialism.    Obama's cowardly decision to bomb Libya (but not put boots on the ground) without consulting Congress is biggest mistake in foreign policy since Vietnam war.  He does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.   He should return it immediately (with the money) but I would gladly waive that for just one peek at his birth certificate.        If America was living in a situation where they feared ethnicity and did not see itself as a multiparty state or nation, how could a young man born here in Kenya, who is not even a native American, become president of America?\\"   ~ James Orenga, Kenyan MP and Minister of Lands, March 25, 2010     The man has spent us into oblivion, gotten us into another war, jacked up unemployment, poverty, food stamps, welfare, foreclosures, and he is remaking America into his very own tin cup, third world, banana republic dictatorship. He's worse than any of us thought he would be, when the idiots and uninformed decided to flush our country down the toilet in 2008.
B0041KKYDI|3.0|The movie is based on the true account of Aron Ralston (James Franco) who, after becoming wedged in a canyon crevice, cuts off his own arm to free himself.<br /><br />After one hour of watching flashbacks, dreams, Franco talking into his camera and sipping water and drinking his own urine, the movie grew tedious. I fast forwarded until it came to the climatic conclusion where the young man cut off his arm and was later rescued.<br /><br />The entire movie was centered around the one self-amputation incident. Most of the drama took place in the crevice, which makes movie-making difficult. Even though the length of the film was only 130 minutes, it felt way too long. An hour would have be more appropriate, but then it couldn't be called a movie.<br /><br />The movie was good, but certainly not great. Franco did a fantastic job portraying the trapped Ralston. The canyon scenery was gorgeous. At the movie's end, there was writing on the screen to further explain something. I couldn't read it. It was tiny white lettering against a light background.<br /><br />It is worth the cost of the rental, but I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD.
B001AYENBM|4.0|A better alternate ending would have been the end of the story on which this was supposedly based. I like this movie, but in terms of horror adaptations, either version is only half a notch above The Lawnmower Man when weighed as faithful translations from the text. Unlike The Lawnmower Man, it would be quite possible to make a feature length movie that actually matches I Am Legend. You want your mind blown by an alternate ending? Read the short story.

0316067938|2.0|I am a huge fan of the first two Twilight books, and a mild fan of Eclipse. But you have to be kidding me with Breaking Dawn. This. Book. Was. Terrible. Not to sound like a pessimist, or a sadist, but books with happy endings where everybody wins just isn't realisitic. Also, the never ending dialogs were taking on a Laurell K. Hamilton feel. I wish I hadn't read this, I think it ruined Twilight for me. Completely. Sorry Stephenie Meyer. This was a bust.<br /><br />However, I am really hoping that she comes out with more (non-Twilight) books. She is a very skilled writer and I enjoyed her (non-Breaking Dawn) books.
0307341577|4.0|Okay. I'll start off by saying that this book was hard to put down. It kept me wondering, and guessing throughout the whole thing, and trying to smartly predict the ending. I like that in a book, too, who doesn't? The story kept me intrigued. I like that in a book. The 4 stars I gave were for the story itself, the writing, and the entertainment factor. Many of the characters were hard to like, Runner and Diondra, for instance, and Libby, the main character. I don't have to like all the characters in a book, that's what makes life interesting, but wow....a couple of them I hated with a passion (Runner and Diondra).    What I didn't like: The book was hard to read, at times, for a major animal lover like me. I am a vegetarian and I do a lot in animal rescue. They're my whole life, basically. Because of all that, I do not like to read books or watch movies where animals are constantly being abused or disregarded or whatever. Spoilers ahead, so if you haven't read the book, don't go any further. *****Spoilers***** Some of these instances of which I speak: The main character, Libby, throws a tiny dog belonging to her aunt against a counter edge and it dies. She says several times throughout the book that she cannot stand dogs. Well, I love dogs, so piss on you, Libby. The worst of the animal abuse was the slaughter of a cow by a spoiled, stupid, greedy, evil teen girl named Diondra. I absolutely detested this monstrous b*tch. Diondra did many other things, yes, but I am only speaking of the animal abuse right now.*****End Spoilers*****      Yeah, my biggest complaint was that. I fully expect to be called a fussy animal-loving b*tch, so go right ahead. But this is a warning to those of you who have a huge heart for animals like I do - parts of this book are NOT easy to read. It had to be said.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm curious who's been giving all of the quality apps negative reviews. This is the most updated Android version of Angry Birds, except it doesn't have ads.<br /><br />This game is smooth, fun, packed with levels, and constantly updated. It works on pretty much anything. Not to mention how a static price drastically cuts into Rovio's revenue model of ad-based income.<br /><br />In all, no one should be rating this game less than 5 stars. This is a modern classic that has been faithfully brought to the Android OS, and now is offered without ads at the same price as it's iOS counterpart (um and cheaper/more compatible for tablets). This is a winner.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This film was a great hit with my grandchildren ages 3 and 8. They also continued t5heir support of the characters presented in the other Toy Stories.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Amazon App Store isn't evil. Stop rating the game bad because you can't read.<br /><br />This is the most polished and varied offering of Angry Birds yet to be released. Unfortunately it's not all that original. Still, most people that can read Amazon App Store guidelines know what they're getting here.<br /><br />The framerate and graphics are very smooth and absolutely gorgeous. The camera has been improved, and some new sounds have been added. The best part is how you're not shooting pigs over and over again. There's new enemies and objects that make this feel fresh all over again.<br /><br />The only downside here is that the initial offering doesn't have many levels. You won't get all stars and hidden items that fast, mind you, but you'll want more once you're done. With levels planned to be released over the course of the year, this will certainly be a purchase that continues to increase in value.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Visually beautiful and a good plot.  Unfortunately, it deviates from the book, but the plot was well thought out and I have enjoyed this film many times.  The animation, graphical artistry, lighting, flight of the various birds all made for total visual enjoyment.<br /><br />There is violence in this movie and I would not recommend it for children under about 10 years of age.<br /><br />I did not know that storms could have 'baggy wrinkles' until I saw this movie!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|This review has spoilers and assumes most people reading it have seen the movie (it's been out for quite a while), so if that's not you, you should probably skip this!<br /><br />I approached this movie from the position that Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made. So its sequels have a lot to live up to. I did enjoy the third movie, but Terminator Salvation is relievedly grittier, with more action and lots of scary robots. It's the year 2018, and John Connor is 34 and a lieutenant in the Resistance; his father, Kyle Reese, is a teenager somewhere in the wastelands of L.A.; and a man named Marcus Wright appears, having last been seen receiving a lethal injection in 2003. And yes. The external USB drive lives on.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie I was reminded so much of The Road Warrior (or Mad Max 2) because that movie was so brilliantly, awfully dystopian, just the vast, unforgiving outback splattered with blood, populated by seriously, ridiculously insane people. Marcus Wright, Kyle Reese, and the silent child (who looks very oddly like a young Janet Jackson) are up against the same bleak landscape, only dealing with machines with a singular agenda.<br /><br />I was also reminded of Robocop, when Marcus realizes he did not die but was instead merged with cybernetics and metal; and even Transformers, because of the height and bulk of some of the Skynet machines.<br /><br />The action sequences themselves are excellent, and you have to love the POV we're presented with when Connor's helicopter goes down near the beginning of the movie. The machines have always looked frightening, with their red eyes and body-builder necks, and I have to say they got my heart going in several scenes. There are fond homages, as is requisite with sequels, it seems: Marcus breaks out the windshield glass of a battered 18-wheeler; Reese says \\"Come with me if you want to live;\\" Arnold returns via CG.<br /><br />It was actually unnecessary to have the Marcus Wright character. The participants of the Resistance are up against enough as it is. His mission wasn't to kill John, or Kyle. So what was it? I can't even say, which means it must not have been that important. The movie didn't need a time-traveling machine/man, and the more I think about it, the more the character could be taken out of the movie with little damage done to the plot. Obviously it's not good for a main character to be so superfluous. (Yes, I know, he gave his heart; but as a writer I can tell you how easy it would be to just give John a different injury)<br /><br />Interestingly, John Conner ends up fighting a machine that was twice his protector in the past (a replica, of course). Though the terminator loses his \\"Schwarzenegger face\\" early, it is against him that both John and Marcus battle, and I found that kind of poetic and sad in a science-fictiony way. In the end, the terminator was always only a machine programmed with a mission.<br /><br />I have a problem with the forced romance between Marcus and Blair Williams, the young woman who fights in John's unit. In fact, I have a problem with any movie that injects romance \\"just because\\" and it happens ALL the time and I'm really tired of it. In this case, because Blair seems pretty plucky and self-sufficient, her feelings for Marcus, especially after finding out he's a machine, make her seem just kind of weak and stupid. The movie should have tried to emphasize that Blair lives in a world with too few real prospects for love, a world in which \\"not even if you were the last man on earth...\\" has to be re-thought, and how depressing that is. But Blair seems content to be a soldier and just accept life for what it is. Not exactly the mindset of someone who would immediately fall in love with a robot. It just wasn't well done, in my opinion, and there was a way it could have been and the writers/director missed the mark.<br /><br />Another thing that disappointed me was that it is set in 2018, not 2027 or whichever year people and machines began being sent back in time. I guess they want to start a new trilogy, but I think that's too much. This movie should have been about the end of Skynet, plain and simple. Why call it \\"Salvation\\" otherwise? I went in hoping to see John Conner truly save the world, not just move up the ranks. T2 was such a vast accomplishment, basically a perfect movie, that to try and keep the story alive will only continue to submit subsequent entries in the franchise to inevitable comparisons to a movie that can never be topped.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is very good, better than the third, and I appreciated how well done the action was because it's always so crucial to these movies. I think Christian Bale was a perfect choice for his role, and if you look at the John shown at the beginning of T2, there is scarily some resemblance in certain light. However, the need for the Marcus Wright character just isn't there, and it's depressing that the fight against Skynet STILL isn't over. At this point we can literally sympathize with the Resistance...r year people and machines began being sent back in time. I guess they want to start a new trilogy, but I think that's too much.

T2 was such a vast accomplishment, basically a perfect movie, that to try and keep the story alive will only continue to submit subsequent entries in the franchise to inevitable comparisons to a movie that can never be topped.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is very good, better than the third, and I appreciated how well done the action was because it's always so crucial to these movies. I think Christian Bale was a perfect choice for his role, and if you look at the John shown at the beginning of T2, there is scarily some resemblance in certain light. However, the need for the Marcus Wright character just isn't there, and it's depressing that the fight against Skynet STILL isn't over. At this point we can literally sympathize with the Resistance...

At first I wasn't sure where it was headed, even though I know that all of Jodi Picoult's books are headed to the court room. I thought, not for the first time with one of Picoult's books, that there was a lot of religion - A Lot but unlike Change of Heart, this one didn't really rub me wrong or come off as too preachy - it needed to be there. I thought Picoult did a fantastic job of covering all the viewpoints in every topic discussed. A well thought out novel with a wonderful ending.<br /><br />Definite recommend!
B004FGMV0W|5.0|First of all I am a HUGE Avril Lavigne fan and I've been waiting to get my hands on some new material for many years. It was worth the wait. Although i had mixed feelings about her third record, i absolutely loved the first two and this record is more like them than the Best Damn Thing. The songs are really expressive and heartfelt and there are a few fun, upbeat songs like \\"Smile\\" and \\"What the hell\\". My favourite song off this album is \\"Goodbye\\" but i also really fancy \\"Push\\" \\"Smile\\" \\"Darlin\\" \\"I Love You\\" \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Remember When\\". Overall this record is absolutely amazing and is definitely worth the unreasonably long wait.  xoxo
0312370849|4.0|** spoiler alert ** I wish I could give 4.5 stars. The first half of this book was like a train wreck for me (it was written so well, I had to keep reading bc I NEEDED to know... I needed to know about Michel... I needed to know about Sarah...). What these innocent people went through and for what??<br /><br />Well, thank goodness the 2nd 1/2 of the book calmed down some and I wasn't horrified at the unnecessary brutality. And it didn't surprise me AT ALL that she took her own life. I give her credit for getting to the age of 40.<br /><br />I will DEFINITELY recommend and already have.

B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|In the film's opening moments a teenaged girl stalks a caribou in the frozen wilderness and soon shoots it with an arrow. Approaching to deliver the coup de grâce she softly informs the caribou, \\"I just missed your heart.\\" And, at that moment, there's this premonition that we'll hear that line again somewhere down the pipe. For Hanna, it's all part of her lifelong training as an assassin, this girl rigorously tutored by her father and raised in snow-capped desolation somewhere near the Arctic Circle. It's frigid living, in more ways than one.<br /><br />Consider the fairy tale overtones which lend a perverse swerve to this stylish thriller. We note this as early as when Hanna leafs thru a Brothers Grimm picture book, and much later when she wanders into a wondrous home that is gigged out like Hansel and Gretel's enchanted cottage. There comes a time when school ends and the student graduates. Hanna feels that she's ready to step out into the world and fulfill her mission, the one for which she'd been prepping all her life. There's a switch that she must flip, for some reason.<br /><br />The filmmakers inject an introspective approach into the mechanics of an action thriller. The story sort of comes at you from an oblique angle, in the sense that not everything is spelled out for the viewer. We never do learn the entire back story regarding Hanna's parents and Marissa, the steely American intelligence officer (Cate Blanchett). Marissa's motivations aren't fully explored. We're not quite certain as to why she's so gung ho to capture Hanna, besides that obvious reason wherein Hanna poses too great a security risk if left to her own devices. But watching Erik (Hanna's dad) and Marissa's interactions, there's a vibe there.<br /><br />To serve as a grounding element and a counterpoint to Hanna's surreal existence, the screenplay introduces a normal English family, holidaying thru Morocco, with whom Hanna meets and gets involved. The best moments for me aren't those in which Hanna goes all assassin-y and wipes the floor with CIA henchmen. The best moments are when Hanna is learning about and reacting to the outside world, and a huge part of this consists of her observing this Brit family. Hanna strikes a tentative friendship with the British teen Sophie (Jessica Barden) who is the first ever girl that Hanna meets - and she first meets her during a frantic escape attempt. In her initial dialogue with Sophie, Hanna realizes that her rote responses don't quite cut it in the real world.<br /><br />The three leads are impeccable. Eric Bana toes that line between the father who loves his daughter but is chary with affection because he knows he has to eventually throw her to the wolves, and she must learn self-reliance. There's a pronounced brittleness to Cate Blanchett's character. She adds interesting quirks to her abstractly vile CIA operative but makes sure that she remains unlikable. And, up to the end, we wonder at the nature of her relationship with Hanna and her father. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Hanna, is mesmerizing. There's a riveting stillness about her. There are times when Ronan is simply just there, taking it all in, her character soaking in all the new experiences. The camera often pans in on her face and hones in on her eyes, which are haunting and expressive. You sense a palpable melancholy beneath the stoic facade. You just want to hug the girl, introduce her to the MTV channel or give her an iPod or something (Before venturing out of the Arctic Circle, Hanna had never been exposed to music). But then you realize that, that air of vulnerability aside, this girl won't hesitate to put a bullet in you if she thinks it needed doing.<br /><br />I expected more action from HANNA, and then I learned in the watching that the writers and director opted to inject more brains to the plot to complement the brawn. The tone is moody and pensive, and this - along with Hanna's journey of self-discovery - serves to lend more credence to the big action scenes when they do come along. It's worth noting that the high octane score by the Chemical Brothers ratchets up the tension that much more. Those moments in which Saoirse Ronan struts her badassery are worth checking out. She's showcased in three main set pieces. The first is when she breaks out of the CIA's impregnable fortress. The second is the fighty fight over at the shipping warehouse. Finally, there is her showdown with the wicked witch. See how I brought it all back to the fairy tale element?big action scenes when they do come along.

0553805371|2.0|Great book to get a bird's eye view of the current deep physics view of reality and all that.  But, the careful reader will see through the presentation and wonder that physicists are any less clueless then the religious viewpoints and myths that the authors are so condescending toward.   In short, no answers are presented, at least nothing different then you would get from any good hard science-fiction novel.   And that space-time infinitesimal ball of curled up space-time still remains at the \\"beginning\\".  No amount of legerdemain with curled up time dimensions can hide it up the physicist sleeve; that cosmic egg was waiting, where did it come from, trans-time?    What should have been added was an afterword that really confessed that science does not know.  Not only does science not know what makes us tick (consciousness, et al), but as this book shows, we don't even know what make the universe tick.   So, yes you can learn string theory, or mush-theory, and and all that,, or you can learn some myths; poetry or math, in the end you'll still be you, which makes you happy?    I think I'll stick with the turtles all the way down.  At least for now.  Maybe if physics can really answer at least one thing, like what is time?  LOL!
0452289963|4.0|Recommend this one - there's a lot of books out there in the niche 'spiritual' marketplace, most of them pretty bad (Chopra being the main culprit). This though is genuinly a good guide on becoming free from old mind patterns. What it perhaps suffers from is a slight laziness in writing/research. For example, very early on in the book Tolle writes:  'that no one foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union.' P19.  He is of course wrong as Che Guevara clearly predicted this back in the 1960s, ironically for the very reasons that Tolle mentions on P13 'that the USSR tried to enforce through external change while neglecting the internal moral and spiritual evolution.' This was Che's criticisms of the USSR, he clearly emphasised the need to develop internal moral values along with external production when building a socialist society. Reader's may be interested in:   [[ASIN:0230218210 Che Guevara: The Economics of Revolution]]    Tolle also comes from a rather engrained post-modern perspective, whereby pretty much all sides of conflicts are the same (eg Israeli/Palestinian)- it's just ego and unconsciousness manifesting themselves. In a sense he's right - it is just ego, however there are injustices (historic and current) which can be neglected from a such  viewpoint. Since it's all really ego the reality of the oppressor and oppressed risks becoming dissolved - which is fine if you're not mired in poverty, exploitation and oppression. To be fair to Tolle he does state that there are 'facts' in the world and that yes there are 'injustices' but  he needs to be more explicit in this. Spiritual enlightenment, to be complete, MUST include an overt political (not just charitable) stand with the poor and oppressed. Only then can there be a new Earth. This book goes somewhere towards meeting that.   'Washing one's hands of the conflict between the oppressor and the oppressed means to side with the oppressor.' Paulo Freire
B0042EJD8A|1.0|July 26, 2012 Update<br /><br />WSJ, 7/25/12<br /><br />\\"The Environmental Protection Agency has given the all-clear to drinking water in Dimock, Pa., a tiny town that received national attention after people there voiced concern about contamination from hydraulic fracturing. In a statement Wednesday, the EPA said it conducted sampling of drinking-water wells that served 64 homes and didn't find any contaminants that would require further action by the agency.....\\"<br /><br />Review Update:<br /><br />I wonder if Josh Fox will be reporting the naturally occurring presence of methane gas in Pennsylvania water supply wells, or the lack of contamination from hydraulic fracturing, as documented in a recent study at Penn State:<br /><br />live dot psu dot edu backslash story backslash 55987<br /><br />Note the following quotations from the study:<br /><br />\\"A study of more than 200 drinking-water wells near Marcellus Shale natural-gas wells in 20 counties did not find statistically significant evidence of contamination from hydraulic fracturing -- a process used by gas drillers to release natural gas using a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemical additives.\\"<br /><br />\\"Conducted from February 2010 to July 2011, the study found methane in about a quarter of the water wells before any drilling occurred, but the concentrations were generally below advisory levels for treatment, Swistock said. The presence of methane can be naturally occurring or related to drilling activity.\\"<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />The scene with the flame coming out of the kitchen faucet can be attributed to shallow gas (stray gas) that has been a regular occurrence in the gas producing areas of Pennsylvania and surrounding states for many decades.<br /><br />Stray gas can be encountered in shallow (< 300 feet deep) homeowner water supply wells that are not anywhere near deep hydraulic fracturing activities.  The occurrence of shallow stray gas can be easily verified by askinglocal water well drilling contractors that have to deal with this problem in a number of areas, particularly where shallow coal seams are present.  Or you could ask me.  I was working on a new shallow (220 feet deep) water supply well in Pennsylvania earlier this year with flammable natural gas bubbling out of the water in the well.  One of the water well drillers I was working with said he has had to deal with this problem for many years (before the Marcellus Shale was developed).<br /><br />The filmmaker obviously needed to do more research prior to releasing this movie. The presence of shallow, naturally occurring gas and oil is a known fact in Pennsylvania.  Now many people who are not familiar with the stray gas problem (which has NOTHING to do with hydraulic fracturing) are being mislead and opposing this technology for bogus reasons.

B003Q6D1YW|2.0|Staged--and obviously so--from beginning to end, this is a movie that purports to be a documentary.  I'm guessing that was the distributor's idea, but whatever the deal, anyone who buys into the notion that CATFISH is anything other than a complete fabrication clearly hasn't seen many documentaries.  As pseudo-docs go, this one is no worse than THE LAST EXORCISM or PARANORMAL ACTIVITY.  It's entertaining and at times suspenseful, but branding it a documentary is misleading, and the story loses a lot of its impact when you realize (roughly ten seconds into the main character's attempt to act convincingly, in my case)you're watching a made up story rather than a documented account of a loser tricking a gullible narcissist into believing in her cyber-fantasy. Had I bought the thing rather than checked it out from Netflix I would've sued the filmmakers for false advertisement.

Since the introduction of VAT in 1973, the resulting thousands of appeal decisions have constituted, in the words of Dolton and Rudling, `an essential commentary on many aspects of the legislation' as well as `the impact of the tax on an increasing range of business and private circumstances.'<br /><br />This latest, annually published edition of Tolley's, the twenty-sixth to be precise, contains entries for over 4,000 cases in nearly 2,000 pages. The title is fully comprehensive, comprising public court and tribunal decisions relevant to current VAT legislation.  The subtitle of the volume is self-explanatory.  It's indeed `a comprehensive digest of reported value added tax decisions relevant to current legislation form 1973 to January 2011' and just what we need as practitioners.<br /><br />A definitive work of reference though it is, this Tolley publication certainly reveals the vicissitudes of business life and the human condition as we know it.<br /><br />What excuses, for example, for late submission of your VAT return will the tribunal accept, or not?  The section on `Default Surcharge: whether a `reasonable excuse' covers case after case on this issue to great effect.<br /><br />Death is usually a reasonable excuse (although it would probably be foolhardy to assume always!). Pregnancy and its complications is often a `reasonable excuse', but again, not always - especially in the instance of a trader's wife who gave birth to a daughter less than four weeks before the (VAT) return was due.  The trader's appeal against a default surcharge for submitting the return late was dismissed, the child's birth, said the tribunal `was an event which must have been anticipated for a considerable period.'<br /><br />Putting all this aside, no tax practitioner or lawyer active in this field should be without the latest edition of `Tolley's VAT Cases'.  The book is also the ideal reference for accountants, students, company secretaries, or anyone in any way involved in VAT.  The publication `VAT Intelligence' has described the indexing system as `far easier to use than the (official) index to the VAT tribunal decisions' which is a telling statement, indeed.<br /><br />This latest edition contains much new material.  The chapters on `Appeals', Business' and `European Community Law' have been expanded  and there are summaries of more than 50 court decisions and over 100 decisions reached in 2010, plus an introductory survey discussing the most important of these decisions.<br /><br />For ease of reference, there are three ways, basically, to look things up: the Contents List at the beginning of the book, the very extensive Table of Statues, and the equally extensive general subject index at the back.<br /><br />So, if you're involved professionally in this often complex area, `Tolley's VAT Cases' in the most up-to-date edition should be an essential purchase living up to its description  in `The Times' as the UK VAT industry bible, and very grateful we are for it in this area of practice.iderable period.'

0393061310|3.0|Guns, Germs, And Steel is an influential treatise of competitive plausibility regarding the challenging question why population groups on different continents experienced widely divergent paths of development. Contrary to the voluminous objections cited in the many of the revisionist historians and anthropologists, the famous biologist Jared Diamond tackles the most important question of global history in one compelling volume: \\"Why did Europeans come to dominate the New World?\\" This question has been answered by others before and Diamond's idea that Europe's geography is the cause geographical determinism has also been proposed before. Any student of history or anthropology can drag up a case or two of this thesis. Baron Montaigne, for example, suggested that Europe's predominance curtailed from its superior government, which could be derived directly from the coolness of its climate. However as an enthusiastic proponent of environmental determinism, Jared Diamond presents a set of premises consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines, but he does not attempt to answer the question of genetic diversity, including segregated intelligence among racial groups as many reviewers have inferred. If anything, implicitly, the author appears to support promulgations of differentiated intelligences; he sets out to demonstrate intelligence was not the root cause to Eurasian dominance.<br /><br />The deep significance of this book is that Diamond's thesis is not simply idle conjecture. He proves that the Eurasian land mass had by far the best biological resources with which to develop agricultural societies, and was thus more able to form large, coherent, and powerful social entities. In order to back this idea, Diamond introduces a set of well-researched data on what kinds of plants and animals are necessary to support a farming society. He investigates the biological resources available to potential farmers in all parts of the world. The people of Eurasia had access to a suite of plants and animals that provided for their needs. Potential farmers in other parts of the world did not have such access and so, their fertile soil went uncultivated. Beginning 13,000 years ago, the author illuminated the circumstances that may have smoothed growth for some groups and repressed the same for others. Diamond accepts the out of Africa theory for the dispersion of Homo sapiens to the other continents as well as the importance of location that they went. For Diamond, food production is the definitive cause of capricious rates of development for different peoples. He demonstrates how the abundance of wild plants subject to domestication and availability of large mammals served as immediate factors to transition from hunter/gatherer bands and tribes to sedentary agriculturally based chiefdoms and states.  In this context, Eurasia was home to important number of crops and animals that readily and successfully domesticated. This domestication resulted in mass food production, which the author claims is the \\"ultimate\\" cause of Western dominance. Food production in turn, led to a number of adjoining causes related to the rise of the West:- farms and animal herds led to stationary populations and excess food to support a specialized class of bureaucrats and soldiers and it also increased population density.<br /><br />After establishing this strong foundation, Diamond falls into reiterating ideas about the creation of large-scale societies. These ideas, while clich&eacute;d, are still enthralling and Diamond presents them in a very clear and well-written way. His other major original contribution comes when he discusses the diseases that helped the Old World conquer the New World. Building on his earlier chapters dealing with Old-World domesticated animals, he shows that these very animals were the sources of the major plagues such as smallpox which virtually annihilated New World populations. The fact that Old World people had immunities to these diseases was a direct result of their agricultural head-start. Finally, Diamond concludes, the unique East-West axis of Eurasia and the absence of any impenetrable geographic barriers fostered the spread of new crops, technologies which gave rise to many competing communities, whose competition further increased the western lead over the rest of the world.<br /><br />These technical details, while complete, are presented in a very easy to fathomable way and Diamond's writing style is fun and engaging. Diamond's arguments are persuasive on the surface, and even the prevalent skeptic will have reason for pause after reading his book.<br /><br />However, I have some concerns with respect to the credibility of this book. I felt that I had to second guess most of his evidence, because it was equivocal, lacking or incorrect. Firstly, Diamond uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" to describe cultures and societies. However, the term is essentially used to describe a geographical landmass or tectonic plates. All the way through the book, he uses the term \\"Eurasian\\" when it supports his hypothesis and replaces the term with European or western Eurasian to support another part of his thesis. He does not separate Europe and Asia to explain societies and cultures even though Europe and Asia contain different religions, cultures and languages. But then again, he separates \\"North Africa\\" from \\"Sub-Saharan Africa\\" even though they are part of the same continental landmass and have more commonalties. On page 161, Diamond attempts to explain his reasoning behind using the broad and vague term \\"Eurasian\\" when he states that: \\"my use of the term \\"Eurasia\\" includes in several cases North Africa, which biogeographically and in many aspects of human culture is more closely related to Eurasia than to sub-Saharan Africa\\". I believe Diamond confuses contemporary North African culture with the cultures that inhabited Northern Africa from 10,000 BC to 8th century AD. For example, from pre-dynastic to the mid-late stages of the Ancient Egyptian civilization, the ancient Egyptians had contact and traded with cultures in Ethiopia (sub-Saharan Africa). The Ancient Egyptian and Amharic language (Ethiopia) belong to the same language group which is Afro-Asiatic, and also belong to the same sub language group, which is Semitic. Diamond makes vague generalities in supporting his thesis and fails to engage significant evidence that challenges his thesis.<br /><br />In addition, when studying the development of different cultures and the spread of food production and technology, he modifies the definition of different terms to fit his hypothesis. Any hypothesis can be supported if you continuously alter the variables you are challenging. I found this to be the most distracting facet of this book. He does this with the terms \\"North African\\" and \\"Sub-Saharan African\\" which are terms that carried little meaning between 13,000 BC until the 7th century, but are used to separate the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egyptians (Africans) with other Africans. On page 92, he states that: \\"the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.\\" That statement is false, since written records of the Ancient Egyptian (African) language have been dated from about 3200 BC, making it the oldest and longest documented language. The Sumerian language, as Diamond claims is the oldest language, developed around 3000 BC. Additionally, a recent archaeological discovery has suggested that some Gerzean pottery with early hieroglyphics located in Egypt could have originated since 4000 BC.<br /><br />Ancient Egyptians were also the first to develop mathematic concepts such as the Decimal system and science such as astronomy and medicine during that time period and significantly influenced Greek science and mathematics. Diamond does not mention any of this and I believe that he leaves out noteworthy attainments by non-Europeans to support his thesis. Throughout the book, Diamond also poses the following question in the background: \\"Why were Eurasians, rather than Native Americans or sub-Saharan Africans, the ones to invent firearms, oceangoing ships, and steel equipment?\\" Nevertheless, Diamond does not engage in the most basic question relating to the motivations of these cultures: Did Native Americans or Sub-Saharan Africans have a need for firearms/oceangoing ships? More to the point, did the Native Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, and other so-called non-Eurasians, want firearms or oceangoing ships? The answer would have forced Diamond to research the cultures and religions of Native Americans and Sub-Saharan Africans in more detail, rather than explaining it with geography and/or food production.<br /><br />Also, he does not include the significant accomplishments of Ancient Egypt, including papyrus, an early form of paper that originated in Africa not Europe or Asia. On page 190, Diamond states that: \\"Continental differences in axis orientation affected the diffusion not only of food production but also of other technologies and inventions.\\" It is known that Ancient Egyptian technology including scientific or medical discoveries traveled along the north or south axis towards the Middle-east and eventually to ancient Greece. Diamond doesn't mention any of this, which further questions the credibility of the book. Another problem with Diamond's style is that he seems to negate the influences of Non-Europeans, specifically Africa and China, to the current Western hegemony such as gunpowder from China, natural resources from Africa by either not mentioning them at all or under-emphasizing their importance. It is quite likely that without the influences from non-European civilizations that current Western hegemony would not exist today. He also makes downright false statements such as in page 247 when he states that: \\"Delivered in grenades, rockets, and torpedoes, those incendiaries played a key role in Islam's eventual defeat of the Crusaders.\\" According to historical records, there is no evidence to suggest that grenades, rockets and torpedoes were used during the Crusades.<br /><br />I agree that the domestication of plants and animals could predispose agriculturalists to further development. However, geography and domestication of animals and plants alone is inadequate to support his thesis without explaining the role of the people and societies occupying the geography. Geography might be a factor to explain how Western Civilization became the dominant civilization in the world today. Though, European civilization did not arise in a vacuum. Regardless of the plausible geographic advantage of Europe and Asia, factors such as political intentions, morals, ethics, religion and culture all served to explain why some civilizations were determined to expand and build empires through conquest, while others did not. Diamond claims that his theories offer an alternative explanation to traditional racist dogma. Conversely, I believe his theories do just the opposite. By stating that Europeans developed into the dominant civilization by \\"chance\\" or \\"luck\\" with respect to geography strengthens racist theories that European civilization was \\"destined\\" to become the most powerful.<br /><br />Moreover, Diamond dismisses politics, religion, culture, individuals, and timing. For example, consider Cortez's victory over the Aztecs. Cortez's victory was not assured. Many elements had to be aligned for a few hundred Spaniards to overcome a mighty empire. The odds were really in Montezuma's favor. Even with horses, armor, and guns, the Aztecs were easily a match for Cortez. The Spanish armor was superfluous. According to Keegan, they even shed their heavy armor in favor of the native quilt vests. The firearms at that time were not quick to reload, so sheer numbers could have overwhelmed the Spanish. The Aztecs lost because of politics, religion, and individuals. The brutal politics and religion of the Aztecs made their subjects hate them. The Spanish were immediately supported with armies and food by the smaller nations like the Totonacs that hated the Aztecs for their cruelty. The insatiable appetite of the Aztec gods for human sacrifices insured that Cortez found ready allies. If either Montezuma or Cortez had been composed of slightly different temperaments the war could easily have gone the other way. Had Montezuma been more decisive, he could have had Cortez killed at the coast. Had Cortez not been so incredibly determined to take the country, he could have just returned to Spain with a load of the early gold presents sent to him.<br /><br />History is determined by far more than geography, plants, and animals. Culture, religion, individuals, politics, and timing all play important roles. My criticisms have nothing to do with \\"political correctness\\", but rather I take issue with Diamond's style of revisionist history that does not emphasize the influence and significance of non-European civilizations towards current Western civilization. While reading the book, I was frequently second guessing the facts of Jared Diamond because they were either inexact or vague.<br /><br />In closing, as an introduction to anthropology and a cogent depiction of one school of thought on the rise of the West this book is marvelous. However, it needs to be approached with an open-mind as it has some of its faults. Reflect on the thesis and the supporting evidence, and then draw your own conclusions. Love it or hate it, you owe it to yourself to read this book. As for me, this book is one of the best revisionist histories on the Ancient Civilizations but as the case with revisionist history, it has its share of one sided and extreme arguments. It is a good book but not great. Still, it is very simple to read and very easy to cognize which I think deserves the Pulitzer Prize it won.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This is my favorite animated movie and it has a greaat plot.  Combine that with the best graphics on blu-ray, and amazing soundtrack and voice acting.  Yeah.  Its that good. I highly recomend this. Its affordable, high quality, and a good movie for anyone 12 and up.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I love this DVD, the picture quality and the sound is brilliant.  Only the BeeGees could produce such an amazing quality and sound performed live at the MGM.    They all had a good sense of humour as well as being very modest, considering their incredible talent.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|why isnt this the same as the updated one on android market? is there a reason its not the same or delayed updates to Amazon
B002HFP0R4|4.0|I liked the Andy cd the best because his music is pretty rare to obtain.  Lots of different songs on the other 3 cd's that I had never heard, the BeeGees had so much talent, they are amazing.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Being a descendant of at least 3 men who fought those 3 days, i was extremely proud to see this film. It has a ridiculously good cast, and most of the film was filmed on location where it happened. I also recently went to the hallowed fields of gettysburg, and it is quite a site to behold. I was however not that pleased with martin sheen's portrayal of robert e. lee. I mean come on, at least get an actor who was born in the south. I can't stand these hollywood goobers who try to fake a southern accent. Anyway, other than that, GREAT MOVIE, GREAT MUSIC!!!!!!!
B000002PCS|5.0|This soundtrack is wonderful.  The music is so beautiful.  I have been listening to it over and over.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I had to reboot my phone after install as it would force quit after the app started, but now works nicely. has some nice features and it like it a lot more than the Adobe Reader.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and solid application performance. I use this app daily. I have NIV and NASB downloaded for off line use.  Thanks for the hard work.
0316069353|1.0|I think most of the other reviewers have already said it but the pricing the publisher chose for the Kindle edition is absurd.  I understand they have to pay some fee to amazon for their kindle book sales but the benefit to the publisher is also in reducing the second hand market for their books.  I tend to buy books used off of amazon due to how much I can save compared to the new price.  For every kindle edition the publisher sells, that is one less book that they have to worry about someone selling into the second hand market and taking away from their new sales.  I wish I could justify buying a kindle.  The device looks great, the price is great for what it does.  I like that I can get out of copyright books for free.  I just would not want to purchase one and find that all of the ebooks are priced as this one is or higher.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Used this app to figure out an interference problem with home wifi, couldnt ask for anything more! I'd easily pay $.99 for it. Easily one of the best android tools or even apps available!
0060936223|3.0|This book is generally well-written, even poetic in parts, but I was very surprised that it won a National Book Award. I would attribute that more to Smith's cachet in certain New York punk/bohemian circles rather than to any particular literary merit on display in the book. The memoir glides along the surface of Smith's life in New York, focusing mostly on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. However much this relationship may or may not have \\"formed\\" her as a person/artist, one senses that the more interesting parts of her life revolve around her post-Mapplethorpe growth as both a poet and rock singer, subjects that get relatively short shrift herein. Perhaps that's her next book. Smith is obviously highly intelligent, but she's nobody's idea of an intellectual (not necessarily a bad thing!) and the book suffers from Smith's apparent inability to get below the surface of her (mostly co-dependent) relationships, and her failure to provide any sort of critical assessment or analytical perspective on the scene she passed through. Ultimately the reader gets very little insight into what drove any of the fascinating cast of characters who pop in and out of the narrative, and very little sense of why the New York scene through which she passed in the seventies continues to have a vibrant cultural resonance. This book is definitely worth reading, though it left me frustrated that Smith hadn't sunk her teeth more deeply into the material.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Great PDF app but unless your phone is rooted you can't uninstall adobe reader. I don't really see a need for two PDF readers. =HTC EVO
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Three teens are stranded and forgotten on a ski lift with no hope of a rescue in less than a weeks time. The winter weather is brutally cold. A pack of hungry wolves circles below.<br /><br />Skiers will never be able to climb onto a ski lift again without thinking about this movie. I'm glad I'm not a skier. I'd take up swimming in the Caribbean instead.<br /><br />The camera captures the isolation and danger. The actors portray the fear, the hopelessness and the desperation.<br /><br />If there was any foul language in this movie, I don't remember it. No sex scenes or nudity either. There is some gore, but it isn't just for the sake of throwing gore into a movie. The sound effects were chilling and horrifying enough. Your imagination will provide the visual. It's a visual you won't likely forget anytime soon.<br /><br />Though parts of the movie dragged while the teens conversed about their lives, it helped to get to know them. I cared about each one of them.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This is the album that I've been waiting to hear from the Fighters for years! Rock (emphasis on rock) Solid from start to finish. It shoots out of the gate and doesn't let up until the end. Ready for the arena and the one to beat for best of the year. Thank you Dave and company - keep up the stellar work.
0670022411|1.0|This book was beyond boring.  Reading it was akin to running a grueling marathon next to someone who spoke incessantly about eating, drinking, snowflakes, cold skin, long kisses, baths and true love.  Then, when you reach the Finish Line, you find that there is no Finish Line.  There is a Starting Line - for ANOTHER marathon.  What a disappointment.
B0046W1692|5.0|Musicalmente, mucho mas desarrollado que otras producciones (incluye armonias y arreglos mas complejos). El cd no incluye tantos \\"sencillos\\" ya que la estructura de la mayoria de las canciones no estan direccionadas para un sencillo de radio, sin embargo no dejan de ser canciones con arte, calidad y mucho mas atrevidas.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Since you're more invested in the mystery of what happened to Salander than you were with the mystery in the original, I found this even more of a page-turner.  I could't put it down, something that I don't say about many books since I steer clear of traditional murder-mystery police procedurals.  I quite enjoyed how the characters developed, and thought that many of the new characters introduced were also well thought-out and failed to fit into the usual formats.<br /><br />The only drawback was that a lot of the names were so confusing - to this American I sometimes forgot who was who since the surnames were similar.  Ah well, at least it isn't Tolstoy and each character had a single name.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is an amazing performance! I wish I had been fortunate enough to see it live but this DVD offers the next best thing. Now and then you can find it on Public Television but it is interrupted by many commercials and the sound isn't the same.  In one weekend we watched it four times and will watch it many more in the future!
B0042RUMJG|5.0|In a word - excellent! What's not to love about this DVD. The sound is outstanding - the best I've heard from any live performance - DVD or CD. The camera work and video quality are stunning. And of course, most importantly, the musical performances are amazing. I am especially impressed with the orchestral arrangements and their participation in the performances. With many of the Rock/Pop performers of late who have added an orchestra to their live performances, they seem to be more or less just \\"background\\" sound. Or maybe an orchestral intro here or there. Not with Sting's Concert - here we have a case where the songs have been totally re-arranged AROUND the orchestra, and the orchestra is fully engaged in all aspects of the songs. Truly impressive work. The only small criticism I might make about the show is that I would have really loved to have seen Sting with an instrument in his hands more often. There are a few songs where he plays his Spanish classical guitar, and one where he's playing his old black Stratocaster. But for the most part these are strictly vocal performances on his part. Very good vocal performances, but I think he seems a bit uncomfortable at times not having his guitar or bass in his hands. He even has a tambourine set up on a stand to his side that he keeps a beat on - not that it's really needed with three percussionists on stage - but I think he almost seems to be hitting that tambourine in place of where he would normally hitting his bass strings or strumming his guitar.....a \\"crutch\\" so to speak. But...nevertheless....incredible show and incredible DVD quality. If you're a Sting fan -GET IT.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Rock Album of the Year if not the decade.  I wouldn't be surprised if it won the album of the year across all genres.  A must buy for any music fan.
B001EO748M|4.0|I love the king and queen kind of movies so this was just perfect for me. I saw the first 2 seasons so I had to order the rest to finish the series off.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I purchased this CD not long after its release. I always enjoyed it, but the last song, \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" has come to be a bittersweet experience for me. My wife Denita passed away on May 26, 2007. As she requested, I scattered her ashes in front of the beach condo we used to rent in Fort Fisher, NC. I remember it was about 2:30 AM and a full moon was shining down on the water. And as I drove back to my motel I turned on the CD player: \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" started to play. When I heard the words \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" all I could hear was \\"Goodbye Denita.\\" Every time I hear it I have to choke back a tear. Thank you, Enigma.    Goodbye Milky Way. Goodbye Denita. I love you.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Really liked this movie. The subjectmatter is definitely not for the fainthearted, or for ones not understanding black humor.  Well worth seeing. The plot involves to damaged people, who have deeprooted issued in letting anyone close to them. Plus, they have a thing for S/M -kind of sex. Love and intimacy can take many forms and we as a society should not judge how people take pleasure in their lives(as long as its legal, of course). The movie is also firm testament on fighting for your love, because it is darned hard to find a soulmate in this life.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I bought this app from the android market for 5 dollars several months ago.  I consider it one of my must have applications.  I read alot of books for work and pleasure,  having an app that remembers where I was is a must. Features like adding my own notes, and having it read aloud are great too. The developer is very active often putting out new releases for things I didn't even notice were wrong or missing.  I consider this a good thing.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I watched this series last year on cable,I loved it! I told my girlfriend all about it and she really wanted to watch it, so I bought the blu ray set and watched it with her again. I still was captivated by this series, and my girlfriend thought it was amazing! I have already seen season 2 but have ordered it so we can watch it together!
B004KPLVW2|5.0|This is hands down the BEST restoration/transfer to Blu-ray of an older catalog title that I have seen to date (and I've seen them all...I think). I was not a particular fan of Tron back in the day (child of the 80's, teen actually)when it first came out so I was a little leary of how well it would hold up after all these years. Well, it is simply amazing! The amount of effort put into this disc is worthy af an award in my opinion. I have been into HD since it's inception and have seen almost every note-worthy title in HiDef and WOW, this one blows me away considering it's age. Simply a must-own for sci fi fans and Blu-ray geeks alike. I LOVE IT!!!
0316069353|5.0|Thank you Michael Connelly, you won me over. This is a very good, satisfying read. Smooth and well put together, it has the focus of the early Harry Bosch novels and in some ways better. The best Mickey Haller episode yet. A great relief for me and restored my faith in court-room fiction.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|This was a well made film with good performances from all the principal actors. I gave it only four stars however, as it is almost an exact scene by scene and shot by shot knock-off of the original Swedish film. The original is arguably one of the best and most original vampire films ever made. The remake brought nothing new except an American cast and locale, and a paycheck for Hollywood.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|As good or a bit better than the name brand backpack(which I also own) sold by Amazon.  Small footprint outside but room enough for three (d)SLR bodies and and three medium sized additional lenses.  Can't comment on durability yet but seems to be well made. A good bag at twice the price if every copy is as well made as mine. Might not want to put 5k worth of gear in it, but if you got the scratch for Pro-gear you got it for a pro-grade bag.  But for everyone else this bag will rule!
B004HGBUVG|5.0|To be sure, Lucinda Williams seems to always do something unexpected. This time, she has two versions of the same song; one CD called a Kitchen session version, which has an acoustic, raw, echoing sound, and then a perhaps a more traditionally produced CD. The first track on both CD's, Buttercup, is also a departure. In this one, Lucinda is spurning the needs of a prior lover because of his past transgressions. A younger, less wise Lucinda, might have taken him back despite his sins. It's feels good to see the strength of this American poet rise up and say just because I have a heart doesn't mean I'll let it be trampled. There are other great rock tracks, which support the album and this single.
0141192410|4.0|While I still love the covers for the penguin classics series and I enjoyed \\"Little Women\\" as a story, after having read \\"Tess of the Durbervilles\\" and enjoying the incredible footnoting, I was a little disappointed with the footnotes for \\"Little Women.\\"
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I thought by now, after hearing the song Rolling in the Deep all over the radio and elsewhere, I'd be tired of it. Far from it, especially since it leads right into what I think is the best track, Rumor Has It. There's a group of slower melodic tunes that put the richness and emotion of Adele's voice front and center. Then there's at least one more good rocker besides the two I mentioned to keep the CD from being purely a showcase for Adele's voice - without rolling in the deep.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Wonderful series. One of our favorites from Playtone production company. Watched the original airing on HBO. Now we can watch the series anytime we want.
0895260131|1.0|I can't believe how ridiculously bad Spencer's arguments were constructed. He quotes the Qur'an way out of context everytime he uses it as a source. For instance, the \\"slay the disbelievers\\" verse he loves to use, when it is read in context, it becomes extremely clear that the verses are referencing one specific group in history, the Quraish and their allies, whom no historian has ever denied to have oppressed and attempted to murder the entire Muslim community. Go read that chapter. It's super clear. It even begins referencing the previous treaty between the Quraish and Muslims that the Quraish's allies broke.<br /><br />Also, the idea of \\"abrogation\\" is foreign to the original sources, the Qur'an and Hadith. Verses are not abrogated according to the Qur'an so long as they remained remembered. Verses of law that supercede other verses do not nullify previous verses, but are meant to show a contextual pattern. In other words, here's what you do in this case and here's what you do in that case. In fact, that is the reason the prophethood of Muhammad, peace be upon him, lasted for 23 years. To show us what we do and when, in all kinds of situations. The scholars who came after the Prophet, peace be upon him, introduced the idea of abrogation in terms of the verses of the Qur'an but misunderstood this aspect, all of which is verified by the Qur'an itself. None of the scripture's text that was remembered and recited by the Prophet, peace be  upon him, was to be \\"nullified\\" or erased, or even claimed to be of lesser value. Period. The only abrogation the Qur'an comes with is the abrogation of previous scriptures revealed by God, though the truth of those revelations remain (or the truth of what hasn't been corrupted within them).<br /><br />I won't mention his use of Ibn Ishaq's work in writing about the Prophet's life, of which Ibn Ishaq stated himself was not verified to be authentic. Others have done so well enough.<br /><br />So that's just one example. I'm not here to rebut every single error (of which the entire book is riddled with), but I just am shocked at how many 5 star reviews there are of this book. It's scary what the mainstream media along with the CIA/Mossad supported terrorist groups have done to the name of Islam. Yes, you read that right. CIA/Mossad agents have been busted numerous times posing as Al Qa'eda members, and the Taliban has stated numerous times that car bombs were not done by them but instead by Blackwater. Ask yourself, who really benefits after a terrorist attack? Is it the Muslims, or the Muslim people or is it the government that then claims to be a victim and cashing in on a blank check to go to war in regions that just happen to be of utmost importance in terms of geo-strategic implications as well as major resources?<br /><br />Yeah, I thought so. The first thing any good detective does is look for motive, and it's clear to any rational mind where the motive lies.<br /><br /> What's going on in the world is more about false flag attacks to further a globalist agenda on the part of Masonic and Zionist interests than any Islamic threat. The real threat is if the Muslims don't unite against this and fight against oppression the correct, Qur'anic way, which does not allow the killing of non-combatants (civilians) nor aggression in general.<br /><br /> It's no wonder that Spencer and these terrorist groups love to selectively quote the Qur'an as well as use abrogation as a justification to do so... they're both cut from the same ilk. They're both part of same agenda. I'm sure Spencer absolutely loves when he hears about a terrorist (I won't dare call that terrorist Islamic) killing civilians; because it furthers his cause.gle error (of which the entire book is riddled with), but I just am shocked at how many 5 star reviews there are of this book.

8857206882|5.0|I like a lot the style of [[ASIN:1904587704 Zebrato]]Michael Lvine & Michael Kenna images.  As a photographer,I found the book very aspiring.

B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is a animated comedy/musical film by produced by Disney and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.  It features the voice talents of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Brad Garrett, as well as others.  The story is based on the old fairy tale, \\"Rapunzel\\" by the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />  The movie takes place in a royal castle during medieval times with a little girl named Rapunzel(Mandy Moore), with magical golden hair that has healing powers and can restore youth.  An evil witch who is trying to stay young, Mother Gothel, (Donna Murphy) kidnaps the child and holds her captive in a remote, elevated tower.  Rapunzel grows up believing that Gothel is her mother and has never been outside the tower as a result of her \\"mother\\" telling her the world is filled with horrible dangers.  So Rapunzel has never known anyone else except her mother and her pet Chameleon Pascal.  Every year on her birthday, as Rapunzel looks out her window, she can't help but notice an arrangement of floating lights hovering in the sky, and she can't help but feel as if the lights are meant for her.  So on her 18th birthday she plans to ask her mother to leave the tower and head for the mysterious floating lights and find out what they are.  Her mother forbids it, so Rapunzel comes up with a plan, she asks for a special kind of paint that's 3 days journey away, after which Rapunzel plans to leave the tower.  As all this is happening, we meet the narrator of the story, Flynn Rider, (Zachary Levi) a hotshot thief who had stolen a tiara from the royal castle, on the run from the castle guards, and a hyperactive horse named Maximus, he takes refuge in the same tower that holds Rapunzel.  Rapunzel frightened, knocks him out with of all things a frying pan and ties him up, she hides the tiara and when he awakes she tells him that if he agrees to take her the floating lights she will reveal the location of the tiara, he accepts, and the two set off on an adventure to the castle, all the while trying to avoid Mother Gothel, Maximus the Horse, and two old partners of Flynn who also want the tiara.  The two go through many crazy experiences meeting friends and foes as Rapunzel learns what the outside world is like and learns what love is as well.<br /><br />  I was very impressed with the animation in this movie, everything seems to go together, it has bright, vibrant colors, and the special effects are beautiful and work with the movie.  I love the way they portrayed certain characters, the chameleon, Pascal, is sooo cute and is always doing silly gestures towards Flynn, although he can't speak you always know what he's trying to say, kids will love him.  I also love the way they depicted Flynn Rider, his funny faces and his eccentric personality really adds something great to the movie, he's a very likeable character, and finally, the horse Maximus, has to be my favorite.  He is a very determined horse who will stop at nothing to get his man.  The funniest thing about him is not how crazy he acts but the fact that he acts like a dog, he sniffs around on the ground, he growls, and even the characters in the movie treat him as a dog, (even saying things like \\"good boy, you wanna play fetch\\" and such) he's definitely the craziest character in the movie.<br /><br />  Another thing I enjoyed in this movie was the fact that it's a musical, I grew up in the 90s when all the Disney movies had great songs to go along with them that you remembered all throughout your childhood and that is pretty much non-existent now.  Although I do love a lot of movies out nowadays I miss the musical aspect of children films.  Tangled has done a swell job of bringing that back into Disney Films and I don't know about the rest of the world, but I found that very gratifying.  My favorite ones in particular were \\"When will my life begin\\" and \\"I see the Light\\".  Although the songs in this movie weren't as amazing as say, songs from Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, they'restill catchy and memorable, at least for me.<br /><br />  All in all, I LOVED this movie!  it's a great addition to the long list of great Disney movie, I think both kids and adults will love it, I know I was laughing all the way through.  I recommend this to anyone who loves animated movies.and memorable, at least for me.       All in all, I LOVED this movie!  it's a great addition to the long list of great Disney movie, I think both kids and adults will love it, I know I was laughing all the way through.  I recommend this to anyone who loves animated movies.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|OK you negative reviewers, yes, the book is long, but so is Les Miserables.  Does the length of the book make it not worth reading?  Not when the text is lyrical and the quotes memorable.  Not in my opinion!  (Quick example: Grapes of Wrath=boring and unreadable.  Atlas Shrugged and Shantaram=powerful, exciting, and life-changing.)    Shantaram is an exciting tale full of memorable quotes and philosophical questions.  Just like Atlas Shrugged, Shantaram made me pause from my every day life of work, traffic, and email, and wonder about the journey I will take in life, what I think about God, if one can justify crime by the lack of sin, and the nature and strength of love.  How often does a book make you do that?  For the negative reviewers, I would say \\"never\\", but for those of us who HAVE been moved by beautiful writing, this is a must-read.  (One quote that made me think particularly was: \\"Fate gives all of us three teachers, three friends, three enemies, and three great loves in our lives. But these twelve are always disguised, and we can never know which one is which until we've loved them, left them, or fought them.\\"  Who are mine and how many have I met?)  Take a minute and read the first page.  If it intrigues you, you will NOT be disappointed.  If you're already bored, put the book down. You don't enjoy literature.    This is a book for people who actually ENJOY reading.  ALL the negative reviews talk about readers' distaste with the prose of the book (\\"I started to read diagonally\\"...\\"skip all paragraphs that start with...\\"...\\"I followed the format of read one, skip a few, read one more, skip four more\\").
B003UESJF6|5.0|Megamind is an computer-animated comedy produced by Dreamworks and directed by Tom Mcgrath.  It features the voice talents of Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross, Ben Stiller, and Jonah Hill.  The movie takes place in a fictitious city called \\"Metro City\\" in modern day times.<br /><br />  Plot: The story centers around Megamind (Will Ferrell) a blue alien with a problem pronouncing words who is supposedly super intelligent, (though I'm not so sure on that one) who was sent to Earth as a baby, along with his fish, Minion (David Cross).  At the same time, another baby, by the name of Metro Man(Brad Pitt), is also on his way to Earth, and outclasses Megamind in every way.  Once they arrive on earth, Metro man is sent to a mansion with a rich family, where life is handed to him on a silver platter, meanwhile Megamind is sent to the prison to be raised by inmates.  The two end up going to school together and Metro Man is the popular one because of his super powers, while Megamind is the outcast and is the last one picked for everything, such as sports (even picked after a kid with a broken leg during dodge-ball).  Megamind realizes that the only way to get respect, is to be the bad guy, and thus we fast forward to the future.  Megamind is an adult now who has become a super villain with his sidekick Minion. (who has a diving helmet with robot body taken from an old sci fi movie)  Megamind still remains arch enemy of Metro Man, and is always kidnapping his supposed girlfriend, Roxanna Ritchie (Tina Fey).  For his latest scheme he routinely kidnaps Roxanne and waits for Metro Man to come rescue her.  Megamind tricks Metro Man into getting trapped in an old observatory where plans to shoot a death ray directly at him.  While the death ray is taking forever to gather energy, Metro Man tries to escape, but the observatory is lined with copper, which Metro man claims is his weakness, so finally the death ray fires and Metro Man is incinerated, meaing that for the first time in history, bad has triumphed over good.<br /><br />  Megamind can't believe his luck and celebrates by taking over the town, but after just a short time he becomes depressed and feels as though he has no purpose, and if not to make matters worse, he is starting to fall for Roxanne and is now dating her, disguised as a museum curator named Bernard (Ben Stiller).  Roxanne, unaware that she is really dating Megamind, gives him an idea to create a new super hero.  Megamind is thrilled with the idea, finally he will have a purpose again. But when he accidentally turns Roxanne's overweight, socially inept cameraman, Hal Stewart(Jonah Hill) into the new superhero, Tighten, Megamind has to train him to be just like Metro Man, a noble superhero that lives to serve the people and be the good guy.  But what if the superhero isn't such a good guy, and what if the supervillain must become the good guy to save himself and the ones he loves?  Two questions never answered until now.<br /><br />  My thoughts:  At first I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this movie, the cover just seemed unappealing to me, but never judge a book by its cover, this movie is amazing.  The animation is very well done to the T.  You also will get very invested in the characters, all of them are very well portrayed and Megamind is silly and very likable.  His sidekick Minion is an ugly fish in a giant robot body, but by the end of the movie I thought he was really cute, I don't know why.<br />  The music is also a great addition to this movie, instead of kiddie songs, we get Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N Roses, AC/DC, and even Michael Jackson.  I loved this soundtrack, there aren't too many kids movie I would consider buying the soundtrack for lol.<br />  So in conclusion, this is an instant hit, a lot of people were drawn away from it like me in the beginning because of the cover, but looks can be deceiving, this movie is great for kids and adults alike, and I recommend it to anyone.ime in history, bad has triumphed over good.       Megamind can't believe his luck and celebrates by taking over the town, but after just a short time he becomes depressed and feels as though he has no purpose, and if not to make matters worse, he is starting to fall for Roxanne and is now dating her, disguised as a museum curator named Bernard (Ben Stiller).  Roxanne, unaware that she is really dating Megamind, gives him an idea to create a new super hero.  Megamind is thrilled with the idea, finally he will have a purpose again. But when he accidentally turns Roxanne's overweight, socially inept cameraman, Hal Stewart(Jonah Hill) into the new superhero, Tighten, Megamind has to train him to be just like Metro Man, a noble superhero that lives to serve the people and be the good guy.  But what if the superhero isn't such a good guy, and what if the supervillain must become the good guy to save himself and the ones he loves?  Two questions never answered until now.       My thoughts:  At first I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this movie, the cover just seemed unappealing to me, but never judge a book by its cover, this movie is amazing.  The animation is very well done to the T.  You also will get very invested in the characters, all of them are very well portrayed and Megamind is silly and very likable.

0525422943|5.0|Six months ago, I was luckily enough to stumble upon Gayle Forman's If I Stay. I devoured this book and it stayed with me long after I turned the last page. The words were poetic, the images vivid, and the music included became its own character. It was painful, romantic, and beautiful all rolled into one, tugging on every single emotion I had. I immediately pawned it off on my mom who had the same visceral reaction I did.<br /><br />Then enter six long months of waiting for the sequel.<br /><br />I had no doubt in my mind that I would love this sequel. I trusted Gayle as a storyteller, and I knew her prose would be heartbreaking as usual. But I never expected to devour it again in one quick sitting, NEEDING to know what happened between these two beautifully crafted, living and breathing characters.<br /><br />I knew it would be great, but I didn't think it could really compare to the haunting beauty of the first. How could it? The first dealt with tragedy, death, falling in love, and intense emotional relationships.<br /><br />WHERE SHE WENT is told from Adam's POV and Gayle hit it out of the ballpark. His voice is authentic and raw, and painfully realistic. As I traveled along with him, discovering what happened three years ago and how he handled every day since without her, I only fell for this boy harder. Fans of IF I STAY will remember how he brought Mia back from the brink of death before, and the vow he made if she returned to him. Now living with the regret of making such a vow and missing her, the music dreams he has achieved feel empty.<br /><br />Adam's story is just as emotional as its predecessor, the love just as powerful, and the music just as vital to the storytelling. After Mia left him, he shut himself away in agony only to reemerge to write the breakthrough album for his band Shooting Star. The lyrics Gayle included at the beginning of each chapter told in present day added an entire new dimension and layer to the experience.<br /><br />After turning the last page, not only did I want to run out and buy Collateral Damage, but I also wanted to learn how to play cello.<br /><br />I am hesitant to say that Mia and Adam's story is wrapped up beautifully--only because I am afraid by saying that, by putting that truth out there, that Gayle will stop here. I love these characters and if anyone can find a way to create another tale for these two, despite their blissful reunion at the very end, it's her.<br /><br />If I STAY and now WHERE SHE WENT are both in my top five books of all time. And that's pretty impressive.run out and buy Collateral Damage, but I also wanted to learn how to play cello.

0525951652|5.0|This was the first Ken Follett book I have read and I enjoyed it a lot. It was a lengthy read, but the pages just flew by and I could not put it down.  The only fault I can find about the book is that the ending felt rushed.  So much attention and detail was put into all the pages but the last couple of chapters.  I think it could have done with a little more detail to wrap up the first book in this trilogy. I would recommend this book to any one who loves historical fiction, intrigue, and romance.

B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie will help you unwind from a long tiring day.  Will Ferrell is, as always ready to catch you off guard with a line to definitely make you smile or bend over with laughter.  My only caution would be that it contains a lot of adult humor and I would not recommend young children to view this. Just enjoy and you will catch yourself repeating some of the catchy phrases that are said through out the movie.
1416955070|4.0|So this book is just amazing, I love the characters, and especially the guys in the book.  It draws you in, the first few chapters I wasn't too happy with, but once it picks up its just so much fun to read.  You won't be able to put this down.  The fourth book just came out April 5, and she is coming out with more I heard.  Give it a try especially if you are into romantic tension with twists and turns.  Her world is so imaginative and exciting...
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is a Real band, playing Real rock after years of paying their dues, feeling their joys and pain, and it all shows.<br />My first listen was the sneak peak on SNL and the Daily show- featured Rope and Arlandria, and all I thought was- ok, MUST Pre order!<br />I don't do that kinda thing- I'm a buy it used if you can type.<br />I did and 2 days later each track has seeped into my skin like the sunshine in spring. This will be on in my home, in my car, when I run, at the beach.....thanks guys!<br />Must mention \\"I should have known\\" as a favorite track (hard to pick only one)- so much to it.

B004NSULHM|5.0|Definitely worth the wait!    Whenever I see or hear derisive commentary on Radiohead's latest release it lets me know that all is still well with one of the greatest bands in Rock history. Stravinsky provoked a riot when he premiered The Rite of Spring, in 1913, and we can all be thankful that his monumental work outlasted the collective breath of the naysayers. Be thankful that there are musicians like these today who refuse to conform to an agent, a producer, or even public opinion, as they stay true to themselves and defy all the forces that would work to package their genius into a nice tidy, market-ready box. All the notes were made ready hundreds of years ago, and the lines have been created, worn-out, and recreated time and again. I revel in the fact that this band still has what it takes to shock and stun a world that is largely jaded and programmed to the point of numbness.    So, you say, The King of Limbs is not your Radiohead? (Just like the New Coke wasn't the Old Coke) Well, I hope they will never be anyone's Radiohead.    If this were visual art, I might call it Impressionism, or Post-Impressionism. With those, you don't walk up too close to the canvas, or you'll only see the blobs of paint. Same thing here with KOL. Don't listen too closely at first; you might be turned off! But, give it a chance, and absorb it gradually. It is immensely rich stuff!
0756404738|3.0|As I neared the end of this book the thing that kept racing through my head was that this book was going to end where it started.  After close to 1000 pages we ended up with Kvothe right back at the University - richer and more of a ladies man yes, but not having advanced the main plot lines.  This was my biggest gripe with the book.  The main mini-stories in this book (University I, King of Vintas, Bandit Hunt, Felurian, Learning Lethani, and University II)each were fairly enjoyable and moved for the most part at a good pace.  The problem is that none of them move the main plot lines of the series along.  Here is what we get -     - Kingkiller : OK he meets a King, falls into favor with him than somewhat out of favor (thanks to his new wife).  Kvothe leaves his kingdom with some nice assets but goes right back to the University.  Is this the king that gets killed?  We don't know...    - Chandarain : Kvothe certainly does not forget about them and learns little tidbits (OK one tidbit about names could turn out to be huge), and even has an encounter with one (unknowingly and at a distance though).  Unfortunately we are still wondering what will come of his search for them, and how he'll ever even find them.    - Denna : His relationship with her takes twists and turns but we really don't know anything more about her.  What role does she play in the future?  Once again we are wondering why this didn't move meaningfully in any direction in the 1000 pages.    - University Expulsion : Well he certainly spends a good part of the book there, takes a bit of a hiatus from it, but ends up back again at the end.  Still no expulsion but we are left with a bit of speculation that it is coming with a new Chancellor being appointed at the end of the book.     - Naming : I was happy with the progress here!  The middle to end of the book sees Kvothe take big steps in the art of Naming.  He calls the wind more than a few times and by the end of the book he's starting to get a grasp of how to do it when he wants/needs to. Elodin is beginning to be less and less \\"odd\\" and is starting to take a real interest in Kvothe and his potential.      - Legend of Kvothe : We see his mini-adventures in this book start to form his legend.  By the end of the book average people throughout the land know of him and his deeds (some true, many not).  But here is the issue - on the book sleeve it states this - \\"...Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.\\"  Yes he becomes a legend but Kvothe actually is at the stage where he is having fun with it in this book.  Since nothing difficult happens to him by books end I'm wondering if that part got pushed to then next book.    - Kvothe of the Present - He's still the innkeeper who is a shadow of himself by the end of the book.  He gets beat up by a few hired thugs.  But outside of that excitement we don't get anything.  Bast is still someone with a keen interest in getting the old Kvothe back, but we don't learn why.  Chronicler is still the same guy although he does start to take a more assertive role in the last chapters.  But outside of that where Kvothe is going in the present is pretty much where it left off in the first book.    In the end I'm wondering if we really needed much of what lies in this book.  I'm assuming Patrick has a master plan laid out and that the stories in the book will have great meaning soon (and by that I mean next book!).  I hope so because this empty feeling I have now about book two needs to be wiped clean by a great and eventful book three.
B003WTE886|5.0|I am not a really big fan of Taylor Swift before buying this CD.  I saw this CD at Best Buy for a really good price, so I decided to buy it.  I LOVE this CD!! I listen to it all the time.  Her songs are really good on this album.  I think it's really cool that she writes all her songs.
0307165485|5.0|Richard Scarry was born to write and illustrate children's books.  He gets the mind of a child. I love the lessons on manners that he integrates throughout all of his books and stories.  I had this very book as a child, and my children LOVE, and I mean love this book.  It is a book for all times, not just for the 60's and 70's when they were written.  Thank you Richard Scarry!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I have been a fan of Britney Spears forever.  \\"Femme Fatale\\" is really good!  Max Martin wrote a lot of the songs featured on the CD.  There are no slow songs on the album.  It is a really good CD to listen to while excercising, driving in your car, or at a party.
0756404738|3.0|the book is pretty much average, I thought that it is too prolonged some moments like when Kvothe was looking for bandints, with felurian and learning fighting wasa prolonged. If they were shorter it would have been better If the book was 300 pages shorter I would have rated it 5 stars, but as it is only 3
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It was amazing. I didnt find it cheaper anywhere else, even whhen used. The shipping was sooo quick. Completly wrapped, brand new, not a scratch on it. And about the movie? It's your favorite sarcastic girl for hours upon hours and you just can't get enough. Love it!

B002962RKE|5.0|I've heard of Glee but have never watched an episode.  A friend of mine is totally addicted to this show!  She suggested that I start watching it because I hadn't really gotten into another show since Ugly Betty's series finale. I decided to purchase and download the pilot and give it a go.  I'm so totally hooked now.  The pilot was hilarious!  I enjoyed watching it so much that I had to write a review.  I'm so late in getting on the Glee bandwagon!  I started with season one but I'm slowly working my way through all the episodes.  I refuse to watch any of the current episodes until I get caught up.  I've been basically using the DVR to record all new episodes.
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|From 1983 to 1992 R.E.M. released Murmur, Reckoning, Fables of the Reconstruction, Life's Rich Pageant, Document, Green, Out of Time and Automatic for The People. This string of 8 albums - 4 or 5 are masterpiece level - are as good as it gets and very few bands have ever done this. The long lost concept of end-to-end brilliance in one album perfected by bands like R.E.M. (U2 and very few others) during this era is what made \\"college radio\\" of the early-to-mid 80's the new pop music of later that decade into the early 1990's. While all of this was happenning R.E.M. was given an $80 million recording contract by Warner Bros. which at the time was the most lucrative in pop music history (more than the $70 million contract given to U2).     What hurt R.E.M. more than the big contract or the eventual departure of their drummer was the change in direction the band took releasing Monster in 1994. They attached themselves to the grunge music movement - an intense but short-lived era in alternative-to-pop music. Why did they do that? Monster attached itself to Nirvana and while Peter Buck mastered the guitar work the album was tough for the R.E.M. fan to learn to love - although many did. Even the Monster tour was considerably less fantastic than the previous (Green) tour in the late 1980's. R.E.M. never really recovered from this misstep.    What followed were a string of albums that had 2-4 great songs and the rest was (very) weak. Some may disagree but the lack of record sales from the mid 1990's and on is just too much of a problem to ignore. Collapse Into Now is the response to the poor record sales and the last album on the Warner Bros. contract - a sampling of the older glory but the earnestness of the songs from 1983-1992 just isn't there so Collapse Into Now falls flat. I have not heard any of the new songs on any radio station. The enthusiasm just isn't there.    It hurts to write a negative review - the first 10 years of R.E.M. were as good as the Beatles in my view and nobody will ever forget that and I still listen to those albums on a regular basis. But Monster tossed them off track. Can they recover? I think so. Being off the big record company label and just doing their own thing again might generate a gem.    I saw an old you tube version of \\"Wichita linewman\\" done by R.E.M. - I think it was in 1995. This band definitely misses Bill Berry.        I can't recommend Collapse Into Now but go back to any of those first 8 albums if you want hear the national treasures that are the early-to-mid period R.E.M. albums.

B004V7EW66|5.0|I have listend to this recording several times since I received it yesterday. (a good sign) I have found Mr Simon's work consistently interesting since Graceland.  I think it is the production even more than the strong songs. At this point in his long life he is looking at some very serious issues--he is a serious man. What amazes me is how consistently he continues to sound new.  I think for an artist that may be the best compliment I could bestow. At his age he is doing what most \\"artists\\" cannot--create a sound that is his--not the hot producer of the day's sound but his sound. (Maybe only a few have the skills as a musician and producer to do this.) Anyway.. it is unusual and valued by this listener. Please give this a listen--it is a sound that you will not hear anywhere else.  How cool is that?
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|Finally got to see it on blu-ray, really good film. For a movie about someone creating a popular website its a pretty nuanced experiment. Eisenberg's Zuckerberg was a pretty good ahole, a layered ahole, you could feel his anxiety, his uneasiness around people and his frustration with people specially when they disagreed with him. Almost like a robot he reacts only to logic. Timberlake on the other hand was a Cameron's villain, serviceable yes but one dimensional. Garfield's Saverin brings a little humanity into the mix which was refreshing. When he confronts Zuckerberg about his settlement and Parker starts mocking him like a little girl \\"look I got your candy\\" I really wanted to punch him in the face and suddenly I realized I had my fist raised as if I was ready to start a fight I guess that goes to show how involving the movie is or how much i dislike Timberlake in any scenario its a pretty good accomplishment.<br />All around the acting was pretty good even the Winklevoss brothers which could have easily been throwaway characters were played very distinctly by Hammer.<br /><br />The irony in the final scene was brilliant that the guy who created the most popular form of social networking is in real life socially inept and is not even fb friends with the girl who inspired him to create the website in first place. Of course that doesn't mean that the real Zuckerberg is like that, but it serves for compelling storytelling.<br /><br />Which goes to my second point by looking at the trailer with the cool A-Capella version of Creep it kinda looked like it was going to be a little more of that social commentary on how the digital age social networking experience completely sheds light on our shallowness, arrogance and impotence. But this was more about the legal tribulations of the creating parties which is still pretty interesting but not as big of a scope as I hoped. But yeah I know that's my fault. I saw the trailer of Spider-Man 3 and I thought it was going to be the most awesome-o movie ever but then it wasn't...<br /><br />In the end I really enjoyed it, a lot of back stabbing, smart quick remarks, a psycho pyromaniac girlfriend and you can even conclude the final statement was \\"gaining the world at the cost of your soul and friendship\\"  but then I dunno if movie Zuckerberg had a soul to being with. Anyways you can always say a movie about who has the biggest di..<br /><br />\\"I'm the CEO..bitchh\\"ie ever but then it wasn't...

1594202559|5.0|Reads like a mystery novel and if you are interested in finance there is nothing else which can come close.    What this documents are the intricate actions of the best and brightest in the field on what they did and why they did it.     What I find so extraordinary is that one of the best fund managers like Michael Steinhart and Julian Robertson were just as fallible and to keep beating the market year over year requires fair amount of luck.    I was surprised to know that Stanley Druckenmiller was one of the main figures behind Quantum's success.    One more thing I found out is the subtle difference between a value investor and a macro trader.   I am a big fan of taleb and his trading methodology but taleb hates buffet. After I read this book I can see why the macro traders hate value investors and vice versa. It basically comes to your personality types - Are you contrarian or a trend follower.    When you are a trend follower you lever up your position but have strict stop losses.  In a value mindset you dont lever up average down but you have to have strong conviction to do this.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|When Echoes was released I was blown away by Long Road To Ruin which quickly became my favorite song back then. The rest of the album though was kind of hit or miss. Pretender, Let It Die, But Honestly, and Cheer Up Boys were all great songs, but Come Alive, Erase Replace, and Stranger Things Have Happened left some to be desired. Wasting Light is much more consistant than their last two albums, and is tied with One By One for my second favorite Foo Fighters album (Just behind There Is Nothing Left To Lose).    Bridge Burning - starts the album off with a bang, no better way to start off an album than with David Grohl screaming :D I loved it upon first litsen, but rest of the song is just ok, and my excitement about this song has kinda faded...the intro though gives it a 3.5/5    Rope - the first single from the album is defantally a grower. The first time I heard it I was disapointed, quite a bit, but with each listen Im learning to like it more and more 4/5    Dear Rosemary - didnt really jump out at me at first but like Rope each listen it grows on me more and more 3.5/5    White Limo - Reminds me of Weenie Beenie from the first album, and I love it, distorted screaming vocal and all! 5/5    Arlandria - much like Rope and Dear Rosemary, it didnt really jump out at me with the first listen. However it is growning on me. 3.5/5    These Days - Foo Fighters posted this song live on their facebook page and I spent all night listening to it and I was so anxious to hear the studio version, and I was not disapointed! Classic Foo 5/5    Back and Forth - Im having a hard time thinking of something to say for this song, and I dont know why because its one of my favorite songs on the new album. Its just catchy! 5/5    A Matter of Time - Im probably the only one that things the chorus sounds a little like a Collective Soul song, which doesnt bother me since Collective Soul is one of my other favorite bands. 4/5    Miss The Misery - This song just doesnt stick in my head. I had to go back and listen to it again to review it. Im not sure why I keep forgetting it because I like it. Just not a standout. 3.5/5    I Should Have Known - Is probably my least favorite song on the album. Its not a track I skip when Im listening to the album as a whole, but not one I track foward to hear. 3/5    Walk - rivals Long Road To Ruin for me. I first heard it and couldnt believe my ears. Foo have really outdone themselves with this song. To me its worth the price of the album alone. Defantally my favorite song on Wasting Light, which is saying something because I thought that was gonna be White Limo, These Days, and Back and Forth lol 5/5    All in all Wasting Light is the best album theyve done since One By One IMO. Though some songs dont jump out at me, they arent songs that I need to skip and maybe in time they'll grow on my like Rope, Dear Rosemary, and Arlandria already have. Like Ive said, its tied as my second favorite Foo album so I must like it quite a bit right? Just so you know where Im coming from, this is how I rank Foo albums.    There Is Nothing Left To Lose 5/5  One By One/Wasting Light 4/5  Foo Fighters 4/5  Echoes Silence Patience and Grace 3.5/5  The Colour and the Shape 3.5/5  In Your Honor 3/5

She has dropped the phone, and nothing happened to it with this cover over it.    Being that its red it also shows up where ever you put it down.  It feels good in the hand, does not feel slippery.  It not bulky.   Was easy to put on.    For 3.99 its a great deal.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am always a little nervous in buying workout DVD's not knowing how they really are. I love this one. I haven't gotten to level 3 yet, but that is only because I intermingle this DVD with my Billy Blanks DVD's. I have noticed with level one my calfs and shins feel the workout and with level 2 it is mostly in my shoulders and arms. In level 2 there is a lot of plank moves. They are great, but man oh man my shoulders burn when I am done, I am also sweating like crazy. I also like how she has 2 other people working out with her and different levels so you can moderate when need be. I would recommend this DVD to anyone.

Here you have the same stereotypical characters in other war depictions...a black guy, a wimpy guy, and a smug gung-ho guy who has a soft spot. It is dreary and not at all suspenseful. Don't waste your time.

0061148512|1.0|Too bad, I was excited to read this book after reading a biography of her by Alexander_______.  However, the book left me dissappointed.  I could not understand anything; while reading, my mind kept wandering.  That is a clear sign to me that the book could not grab my attention and it would be a waste of time to try to read the whole book.  I just could not follow the writing at all.  There was no plot, no flow that lead me from one event to the other.    I read some of the other reviews from readers who also did not like the book.  Some people felt that the book was too depressing and too self indulgent.  That is the whole point of depression.  Depression leads the mind inside oneself and finds fault with the world around it or finds fault about him or herself.  It makes sense that her book shows the main character as someone who was self-absorbed.  That's part of what depression is.
B002T9H2MO|2.0|\\"Moon\\" is one of those films that only comes around once in a while - just when people are looking for a good science fiction film and just when most have forgotten the last one. Spurred by good critical reviews but nevertheless wary, I agreed to watch the film and decided that it was, unfortunately, a near-total waste of time.    \\"Moon\\" has some beautiful shots, from the clean white of the facility interior to the lunar surface itself. The Steadicam-like cinematography calls to mind \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Alien\\", as does the music selection, the pacing, the acting, and even GERTY. Unfortunately, all of this only serves to make it feel like a plagiarized plot that barely squeaked by the legal system, since parallels to elements in the other two movies I mentioned can easily be found. Another issue is the \\"twist\\", which is pretty easy to figure out and leaves the rest of the film wanting. At least it avoided the years-old cliche of the \\"evil computer\\", such as HAL 9000, which is a wonderful breath of fresh air.    In short, \\"Moon\\" is hard science fiction with a predictable plot, poor pacing, eerily familiar plot elements, and a recognizable musical selection. The first third of the film is enjoyable, but once the plot is figured out, it's a downward spiral from there, and not a very enjoyable one, either. Viewer, take caution.
0756405890|1.0|This book should be renamed \\"The Chronicles of a poor college Student\\" and found it quite boring. To the point i quit reading about 3/4 away through it. I lost interest fairly quickly, wasn't impressed and this book IMHO should not be in the fantasy section since it wasn't very fantasy like at all. If you like long reads that tend to dwell on the unimportant aspects of getting through college then its perfect. Would not recommend this book for fantasy readers. Two thumbs down..

0316056863|5.0|You must first speak sarcasm fluently before you can fully appreciate this fine specimen. Oh Tina, this book is gorgeous [not just referencing the front cover..or the back]. She provides us common folk a glimpse of how life can awkwardly stand in a room with you and then open a door that you never knew existed. It felt like the authentic Tina and showed how life can be overwhelming when you meet Oprah, parody Sarah Palin and throw your daughter a Peter Pan themed party all in one weekend.   Life is difficult, decisions are difficult, and dealing with a babysitter is difficult, but everything gets better when you observe it awkwardly and then decide to laugh at it.     Side note: I went to that Evanston YMCA/attached preschool daily when she worked there. I totally met Tina Fey, though I was 2 or 3 at the time, and I probably underestimated her potential, after all she was the front desk lady, and assumed she just didn't have what it takes. Turns out she did. Damn you Tina, you proved my 2 year old self wrong.     READ THIS GEM ..if you've ever watched SNL, 30 Rock, or just thought the lady-man on the front cover was attractive
B0041KKYD8|3.0|It is hard to imagine that a movie such as this would ever get made either in the past or today. With rape, as the main theme and many scenes of brutal violence, it would be a tough project to green light.  I watched this movie in my early teens. I was shocked then and after watching the remake, shocked again.<br />Young writer (Sarah Butler, kudos to her to act in such a difficult role) rents a cabin in the woods to work on her second novel. The movie runs about 1 hour and 48 minutes and can be divided in to three segments, the first segment when the hunt is stalked, the actual hunt or the rape and finally when the hunters become the hunted.  The music is eerie and lends a scary atmosphere to the film. There is not a lot of nudity in the film contrary to what people may think not does this film glorify rape. The original had some moments which bordered on titillation but this one is a better version, in keeping up with times. The torture scenes or retribution scenes were too long in my opinion. ISOYG is a well directed and acted film, the brutal violence towards the end might be a hindrance for many viewers but the suspense leading to it may satisfy a lot. 4/13/14. Three stars.
1401923127|3.0|I read this book because I was and am interested in memes and the science and research Dr. Lipton has been a part of showing communication within organisms is two way.  That the assumed communication process as being one way, DNA to cell parts, cell parts to cell, cell to the individual, is incorrect.  The research has shown it is two way.  We are not slaves to our DNA and we can in fact impact cellular level biochemistry by our thoughts and environment.  That is all very good and helpful and hopeful stuff.  However I am disappointed in the tangents and how atheist Richard Dawkins stuff gets tangled into the book as well as some other stuff that has nothing to do with memes and Dr. Lipton's research.  Memes are a legitimate area of research and need to be examined, understood and presented to people who are trying to change their lives.  It is sad that memes seem to be getting hijacked by folks with an agenda and that agenda gets mixed in with the science.  I will continue to look for information that presents the science in a way that I understand and can pass along the potential applications to folks but at the same time does not corrupt the science with the author's own belief system.  Yes, atheism is a belief system.    I wanted to add this.  Many of these guys who are looking at the way the brain impacts our biology are on the edge of sounding like the prosperity preachers on the religious TV channels.  If I think I can be rich, I'll be rich.  If I claim being rich, then God is required to make me rich.  Sorry but it does not work that way.  I worked for 6 years in East Africa much of it with people who were starving to death.  If all they needed to do was change their way of thinking and food would appear I can assure you the millions who died of starvation in Sudan would not have died.  There is much reality the perversion of memes, and the perversion of the prosperity preachers, do not consider.   Being selective about facts is not any more healthy than people who think themselves into depression.

0756404738|5.0|While others chew on Rothruss for this and that, in the end, this is excellent story-telling.  Where else can you read lyrics written for 3 different cultures that take into account their differences?  And the legend of Kvothe continues to grow, expand, and amaze us, all the while being built carefully and skillfully by an excellent writer/craftman.  When this book first came out, I went back and began with NOTW from the beginning, and segued right into WMF.  Admittedly, the second book is less gripping.  I feel it is because of the multitude of settings Kvothe experiences.  He maintains a certain integrity of character that is difficult.  His relationship with Denna continues to elude him and us.  And his lack of martial skills in the end are astonishing...and a hint of his relationship with Bast draws us into Book Three.  I can't wait!

B003Z0BWRM|4.0|City of Bones (Mortal Instruments 1) by Cassandra Clare. 7/10<br />City of Bones by Cassandra Clare.  Wow.  I'd heard good things about this trilogy so I waited until all three were released.  I'm glad I did.  If I'd rushed out and read it as soon as it was released, I'd be jonesing for my next Mortal Instruments fix for ages.  I don't like jonesing for anything.<br /><br />Clare writes her characters beautifully.  She describes them very well, but it's her dialogue that makes her characters come alive.  Brilliant.  Well, most of the time.  Clary, the main player is a 15 year-old girl in New York who: gets plunged into a supernatural world she never knew existed, discovers she's one of the supernatural folk herself, fights demons, vampires and other nasties, and then she tumbles into a love triangle between the limp best bud and hot new badass guy (the repartee between these three main players is just fantastic, by the way). And, she does it all with the maturity of a jaded 35-year old serial monogamist.  She's just a tad too mature.<br /><br />As for the limp best bud Simon; he's fairly standard limp best bud been-secretly-in-love-with-her-for-10-years stereotype.  And he's mortal, or a Mundie (short for Mundane) as the supernatural gang - shadowhunters - call us.  Poor bloke doesn't stand a chance against the hot new guy... or does he???  As limp as he is, I was jealous of even him in this book because his dialogue was so cool.  Wish I'd been able to talk that way when I was a teenager, instead of being the awkward nerd I was.<br /><br />Then there's the hot new guy.  Jace, his name is.  And he's a terminally sarcastic smartass, who's also one of the best demon hunters in the business, despite being just a teenager.  The mouth on this kid is just fantastic.<br /><br />The main baddie, a thoroughly nasty piece of work called Valentine, is nice and wicked without too much of the all powerful Voldemort thing going on.  Even better, his motives, which at first seem simple, turn out to be be a little more complex.  Good stuff.<br /><br />The setting of New York might tug at the heart-strings of a few, but to me it didn't matter where the action took place.  I mean, it was a nice change from dystopia, or down-town LA or Hogwarts, but hardly important.  In fact, Clare puts a little too much emphasis on settings - I'll explain why in a minute.<br /><br />The story itself is great.  Clare gives us plausible new takes on the origin of vampire, werewolves and demons which is nice, especially because she sticks to the rules.  You know - silver, sunlight, holy water - that kind of thing.  There's the battle to save the world from demons and the missing enchanted thingamajig that can either help or hinder.  Classic stuff.  Of course it's Clary who appears on the scene to help find said thingamajig.<br /><br />So far, so good.  Then my Mr Potato Head Angry Eyes started to notice a few things, like the settings.  New York seems to be where shadowhunters are sent if they've been naughty.  Huh?  New York?  Being sent to New York as punishment comes across a bit hillbilly.  Have a listen to Hank Williams Jr's If Heaven Aint A Lot Like Dixie and you'll get what I mean.  On second thoughts, don't listen to it.  You might need your ears again one day and scrubbing them out with barbed wire won't do you any good.  Just read the lyrics.<br /><br />Then there's their homeland, Idris.  Idris is nestled somewhere in Europe, but it's not on any map.  That's fine.  It's the comparison to the rest of the planet that made me cringe.  The grass is greener there.  The buildings are more beautiful, the people better looking and more civilised and the food tastes better - get the picture?  All these hot-stuff supernatural warriors moping about after some beautiful place like love-sick cows started to wear a bit thin by the end.<br /><br />Next on the grumpy list, was the ending itself.  The ending, even though it's not really the end because we know there aretwo more to follow the first, which isn't really the first because Clare is writing prequels... where was I?  See how annoying that can be?  The ending has a few too many twists and turns.  It also gets a bit Empire Strikes Back - ish.  I'm not going to give away the ending, but when you read it, you'll see it too.<br /><br />City of Bones (Mortal Instruments 1) by Cassandra Clare is a great read.  Don't let the previous two pars in this post put you off.  Really.  Clare's dialogue alone makes it a must-read.  I give it 7/10.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the next one: City of Ashes.  It's there now on my ereader app, just waiting for me.

0061726826|5.0|I just finished this book, and I've gotta say, it was absolutly fantastic. Oliver has such a beautiful writing style that its hard to believe that this is only her second novel! When I first picked up the book, I will admit, I had a hard time getting into it for the first 50 pages or so. But boy am I glad I gave it the chance.     Lena Holloway lives in a dystopian society where love is a disease and science has produced a cure. Before you graduate from high school, you are evaluated and your future is planned for you by the government. There is a strict set of rules that go along with the society. In order to prevent \\"amor deliria nervosa\\" (aka love) from \\"infecting\\" people before their procedures (and maybe even after), strict curfew is enforced and only approved music and activity can take place. And after your 18th birthday, the lobotomy-like procedure is preformed and you're safe, cured, and love-free forever. Lena is eager to have her procedure. She even counts down the days. But then the unthinkable happens and she meets Alex, and the \\"disease\\" happens.     I had no problem at all connecting to the characters of Lena, Hana, and Alex. I enjoyed watching the changes occur in Lena especially, as she realized how flawed the \\"perfect\\" society she lives in really is. Hana was a great character as well. I enjoyed the relationship between her and Lena, and it reminded me of some of the relationships in my own life. Alex was probably my favorite though. He was the perfect boy without being too flaky. He was very real, and I felt like I could find someone like him in real life, as opposed to characters like Edward Cullen who, let's face it, is just a little bit too good to be true.     I would definately recommend this book. Its such a great read that you will not only be able to tear through, but you'll be able to picture every detail as well. I could truly feel so many different emotions while reading this. I felt everything from amazement and disgust at the society,excitement when she described her feelings for Alex, and definately sadness.     DEFINATELY READ THIS BOOK. You 100% will not regret it!
B0000UJL96|4.0|Released in December of 1991, the 20th anniversary of Captain Kirk's final voyage as commander of the legendary U.S.S. Enterprise is fast approaching.  With the famed 1966-69 television series' original ensemble (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan, & Walter Koenig) gathered together one last time, director Nicholas Meyer returns to guide them on one of the franchise's best entries: an intelligent, political murder-mystery that reiterates that peace can frighten even the coldest of warriors.  Tapping into the real world emotions of the Cold War's final days, \\"Star Trek\\" once again demonstrates how and why science fiction can become a timeless analogy to issues that any common person can relate to.<br /><br />In this installment, after heroically defending the universe for more than 25 years, an aging (and now-embittered) Captain Kirk and his famous crew of Captain Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, and Chekov set out on one last adventure battling a nefarious intergalactic conspiracy that threatens to violently disrupt a lasting Federation-Klingon treaty at all costs.  With the Klingon Empire facing inevitable extinction due to a catastrophic environmental disaster, a tentative truce with the Federation is now imminent.  Yet, mysterious forces are at work sabotaging the upcoming peace conference with a devastating political assassination that may well cost the imprisoned Captain Kirk & Dr. McCoy their lives.  In the end, it all comes down to a heart-stopping, fateful race to prevent the next assassination on planet Khitomer during the conference, but a devastating secret weapon awaits that can hold both the Enterprise and Captain Sulu's U.S.S. Excelsior at bay.<br /><br />Backed by an ominous musical score and terrific guest performances from Rosana DeSoto, Brock Peters, Mark Lenard, David Warner, Kim Cattrall, Michael Dorn Kurtwood Smith, and Christopher Plummer (as the imperious General Chang), this \\"Star Trek\\" adventure holds up extremely well over time twisting familiar Trek elements into an exciting political thriller that also serves as the final episode of the original crew's fabled exploits (complete with the cast signing off with a flourish on the last Captain's Log commencing the end credits).  The only significant drawback of this film is its over-reliance on Shakespearian quotes (particularly by Christopher Plummer late in the film).  While it is fantastic for Trek to offer such a literate, thought-provoking plotline, overkill in the final act makes the whole Shakespearian concept come off as possibly too pretentious.  Even so, Captain Kirk's log entry concludes the festivities with a timeless quote harkening back to \\"Peter Pan,\\" which is an appropriate, classy farewell to the original, classic Trek, while graciously acknowledging the franchise's future incarnations.<br /><br />Rating: 8.5/10 (An excellent film by almost any standard, as long as you can tolerate the frequent literary references).<br /><br />P.S. The stellar bonus features include the nostalgic \\"teaser\\" trailer (from the summer of 1991) that should be considered one of the absolute best from that era, as it makes you truly eager to see the film even without offering any sneak peeks.

Give it four stars at least if you have to, but the quite=bad argument doesn't hold much water. There is too much imagery, joy, sadness and most of all, sincerity, in this album.

B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I grabbed the first few titles of this series from a local bookseller on the \\"recommended\\" shelf, and after wading through this mess of a book, I greatly regret that impulse purchase.<br /><br />There are many lengthy reviews of this work at amazon, so I'm just going to reiterate a few of the main flaws of the Malazan Empire series:<br /><br />-Dozens of \\"main\\" characters, who appear and disappear in converging and diverging plot-lines without any rhyme or reason, and without much to distinguish one from another besides gender and whatever special effect they produce on demand to move the plot along. There's a reason why great literature picks *at most* a handful of characters to follow: That's as many as the reader can hold in the mind's eye while still being able to follow a plot and appreciate the prose.<br /><br />-At least a dozen jumbled \\"plots\\" which include, but are not limited to:<br />--An Apocalyptic prophecy, adherents to and opposition against, are all given POVs.<br />--War between the eponymous Malazan Empire, its client states, plus random new enemies that appear every few chapters.<br />--War between the various factions which comprise said Empire, including some league of assassins, differing legions, magical and priestly cabals, etc...<br />--War between mankind and several other races, who are introduced seemingly whenever Erikson gets bored of explaining where the previous race comes from and are each progenitors or decendants of some other race already introduced or yet-to-be-discovered. Also, the various races are all similarly named with just variations of suffix and apostrophe (like Che'Malle, Tok'Malle, etc...) and some vague descriptions of being either simian or saurian (or both) with \\"extra joints\\" whatever that means.<br />--War between the Gods, but I wish the reader luck figuring out who those are, since just like the races there are several pantheons in play, each with its own elders, children, heroes, and races. And to make it even more confusing, humans can apparently ascend to godhead through some unexplained mechanism that involves sitting on a throne. So, in any given chapter, a human could conceivably take a crap on some elder god's chamberpot and become the next divine. And if I seem glib in saying that, Erikson doesn't do much better a job at writing these cosmic events.<br />--War between the gods and mankind, plus several other races, confused by the fact that some mere humans seem able to kill gods, and the divine body count gets as high as the mortal one at times.<br />--The ins and outs of an imperial division on the march, which seems to have been Erikson's original premise, a la Glen Cooks' The Black Company, but which Erikson regrettably abandons in order to create a neverending mind-numbing cavalcade of pointless deities, heroes and races.<br /><br />I'm going to stop there, since I've barely even scratched the surface of the dozens of plots, characters and confusing set-pieces in this ADD-inflected nightmare of a series, and I'm getting a headache just recalling this banal crap.<br /><br />Take my word for it, unless you want inspiration for your LARPer group, stay the hell away from Steven Erikson's disaster of a work.d to godhead through some unexplained mechanism that involves sitting on a throne.

The connect from Watch to my laptop to Garmin Tools works great. Garmin's website isn't the fastest but that is a minor grip. For workout data and programming, they also provide software you can run on your local box. All-in-all Garmin has done a great job of automatically handling the log data and making communication automatic and seamless.  With respect to the bevel, yes it doesn't work the same way as an Apple but it is close. First of all, It has two modes of operation: 1) where the bevel will not respond or 2) where it will response. To get the bevel to wake up, I have to it the \\"lap /reset\\" button first. Then I can get the bevel to do anything I want. Also it took a little practice on how to touch it at first. Instead of a flat surface the bevel is at an angle and it's best to touch it from the same angle. The idea is to you get as much surface contract as possible direct between your finger  tip skin and the actual surface of the bevel. In the out of the fox factory setting of medium sensitivity, the bevel responds very well for me if I account for these two things. Then again, I've only had it one month and have not used it in rain or with lots of sweat on my hands.   So far it's been a great product and easy to use once you learn it's few of modes of operation. The documentation isn't very deep but the product is fairly  intuitive. I have emailed support a couple of times any they have always been quick to respond.    Just like Steve Jobs, Garmin attempts to make the interface as easy as possible and the effort does show. Their customer support is also good IMHO.
B004GHNHVW|2.0|I am not impressed with this CD. If I had listen to prior to buying I would have passed on the purchase. I 58 years old so I understood his style of music. It was no surprise. I just did not enjoy it. Due to the prerelease hype I was expecting gold and got copper. My wife is a huge fan of his music. I listen prior to her leaving for work then put the CD back in her pile for the car without expressing my opinion. That evening I got her review which was about the same as mine.    I going to listen to it the second time. I really cannot say if there will be a third.   I give it a 2.5 stars to be neutralbut but I wont give it 3 so I went with 2.
B0046W1692|4.0|Now, I've been a Mana fan for quite a while. And I'm not one of those fans that just listen to their singles that get played on the radio... I'm the fan that listens to and knows all of their material.     Drama y Luz is a change to Mana's sound, not that they had a distinctive sound to begin with. One of the things I noticed about Mana in this album is that they're relying on a more Alternative Rock sound, which is a first for Mana. Another thing I noticed about this album is that, creatively, it fails to take bigger risks, risks that, if taken, would have greatly improved the album and my rating. One of my main complaints of this album is the muzzling of Sergio Vallin, the band's guitarist. Not that he was constantly throwing out solos, but the length and simplicity of the solos in this album leaves this Mana fan wishing for more from Vallin. I'll give you a more detailed review as I discuss the songs individually:    Lluvia al Corazon: boring track, really. I was scared when I listened to this song for the first time, fearing that this would define the entire album. Fortunately, I was wrong.     Amor Clandestino: acoustic track all the way. The lyrics are a bit cheesy. Kind of bluesy. It's alright.     Reina del Dolor: a bit better. This song actually has a pop punk feel to it, which I don't mind. Vallin's solo, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It had the potential of making the song greater.     El Espejo: now, this is the gem of the album. The use of violins to build up certain parts of the song makes this song great. Vallin's guitar work, while no solos, is heavy and solid. Certainly, one of my favorites songs from this album, and a good Mana song, overall.   (edit): I just noticed that this song has a lot of similarities to the song Donde Jugaran los Ninos. It's good to have the band releasing this type of music again.     Sor Maria: Mana employs a pretty ambient sound with this song. This gives the song a pretty haunting feel to it, which serves the songwell. Overall, a good song.     Vuela Libre Paloma: Synth-driven song. Lyrics are a bit cheesy. Kind of boring, to be honest.     No te Rindas: Two versions of the song. The first one is a ballad. The second one is straight out bachata. Both are good, but I like the bachata version best.     Latinoamerica: a song about Latinos and a call for unity between all people of Latin America. Extremely catchy. The lyrics demand a bit more time to get used to. Straight out hard rock. Fher and Alex's vocals are exceptional, but Fher's voice in particular shines here. Vallin's solo is filled with fast tremelo picking, though it lasts a few seconds. A shame, could've made the song much better.     El Dragon: quite a surprise. Starts out with Led Zeppelin-esque guitar work by Vallin and goes on to a Queen-like chorus (think of the intro of Bohemian Rhapsody). Heavy, really heavy bridge (perhaps the closest thing Mana has done to heavy metal--I'm not kidding). Slow tempo throughout, which fits the song well. Without a doubt, Mana's finest work in this album, and sure to be one of my favorite Mana songs.     El Verdadero Amor Perdona: starts with a middle-eastern-esque guitar riff, which is quite good. The lyrics are a bit weird, but their delivery by Fher is just fine. A calm track throughout, but does its job well. This song confirms a fact about this album: it ends better than it starts.     Envenename: Mana's shortest song they have ever released, clocking at 3:37. Disappointing, since this is my favorite track from this album. Has a really Foo Fighter feel to it, which is just fine by me, since it's really hard and fun. Fher's vocals are great. Chorus is extremely catchy. And this is the only song in this album with a great solo by Vallin.     Overall, a good album, but creatively, these songs feel like they are being held up. By what? The group's desire to simplify their work? The music company's desire to make radio-friendly songs? Who knows. The only songs that escape thiscritique are the songs the other reviews have already mentioned: El Espejo, El Dragon, and Envenename.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Although \\"Inside Job\\" received an Oscar for Best Documentary of 2010, it was not shown at any of our local theaters even after getting the award.  I rented it when the DVD became available March 12, 2011 and immediately decided to buy 2 copies for myself - one to keep and one to loan to friends who might be interested.        It shows with great clarity what caused the mortgage crisis of 2008.  People who caused the crisis were really rewarded at the expense of the rest of us, and nothing has been done to prevent a repeat of the crisis.     The 12 minute special feature \\"The Making of Inside Job\\" is also worth watching.  The movie is about 1 hour 50 minutes and is excellent.  Anyone who unexpectedly lost a job or feels badly squeezed between low interest rates and high prices should see this movie to understand why.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|There is nothing better than sitting down for an evening of comedy with your family.<br />We have all the channels that cable offers, but still there is nothing to watch, but there<br />is always the fall back of \\"The Holy Grail!\\"<br />This set comes with the Script so we take turns acting out the parts<br />it makes for a great evening at home when paid tv has noting to offer.<br />You cannot go wrong with this set!!!!
B002BZOVLG|5.0|What has been stated below is for the DVD of this work that I bought before I upgraded and bought a Blu ray...<br />Here goes:<br />I have been familiar with Cosi ever since I can remember. From an aria or two on my dad's 78RPM records to the beautiful Otto Klemperer recording on vinyl and later on to many VHS tapes and then the Gardiner version, although good, started appearing a little jaded thanks to average acting and dramatization.<br />So when I felt I should have a fresh new production, (sans Eurotrash), I thought I would look up the views of the reviewing proletariat - and thought I would risk buying this one.<br />THANKS GUYS.... Whatever you have stated in all the previous 10 reviews (for the DVD) to this is almost absolutely correct. This is the nearest thing that is akin to an un-putdownable book that I have seen. So fresh, vibrant in acting and absolutely precise sublime singing and interpretation. I think I will measure any other Cosi by the standard of this one.<br />Not just period costumes, but sets that are minimal, but bright and not jungle-jims or abstract pillars and stuff that do not distract, but bring out the essence of the interpretation. I am also overjoyed that it has been performed by artistes thus far not known to me... maybe they are doing well these days, must look that up now.<br />Just that I do not agree with one reviewer (for the DVD) who stated that the third set of Despina and the Don are not up to the mark.. Yes. Despina here is no Lucia Popp but is quite adequate for the role, and if Don had been more powerful, may have killed the character. I think he is just right for the role too...<br />I would unhesitatingly recommend this Blu Ray or DVD  to anyone irrespective of whether it is the first ever video of Cosi or even if one has all the other recordings of it.
0811806405|5.0|This is a very well written and easily understood book.The information contained in it is outstanding and would be extremely helpful to any prospective guitar builder.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|the game itself is great, love the new theme and birds.  however, every 2 weeks the game app will not allow me access and the amazon app store no longer shows the app in my app log.  the redownload fails and when i do get it back i have to start completely over.  i am over replaying these levels and will not be downloading again.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Evangelion 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" is fantastic!  I was awestruck from beginning to end and I have no doubt in my mind that this title will rank high in my top 5 anime on Blu-ray releases for 2011.  This anime film is AWESOME!  I absolutely loved every minute of it!  Highly recommended!<br /><br />In 2006, Japanese fans and anime fans of \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" received exciting news that in the Summer of 2007, the first of four Evangelion films based on the anime television series would be released in theaters. According to news reports, Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno watched the series from beginning to end and wanted to fix up a lot of questions and debates that fans had over the television series and most importantly, incorporate today's new CG technology for the film versions. Even furthering the excitement is that the original crew and cast have signed on to work on the new film.<br /><br />The first film did tremendously well and what made things much more exciting for the promotion of the second film is the introduction of a new Evangelion pilot named Mari Illustrious Makinami, the confident pilot of the Provisional Evangelion Unit-05 and also a teaser for Unit-06.  The full trailer was released on April 2, 2009 and fans of the series and films had a chance to see a dark Eva, Mari, a new Eva-02 design, new designs of Angels and more.<br /><br />So, with mass promotion in Japan, \\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" was released in Japan on June 27, 2009 and similar to the first film, was #1 in the box office earning over $40 million (US) in Japan and also received a US theatrical release in January 2011.<br /><br />With many Americans waiting for \\"Evangelion 1.11' Blu-ray release, suffice to say, the film was released with a very short run at limited theaters and made over $100,000 and was screened at the anime convention Anime Expo in 2009 with great fanfare.<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" opens with the new Evangelion pilot, Mari Illustrious Makinami who pilots the Provisional Unit-05 and is trying to destroy the skeleton of the Third Angel which is attacking NERV's arctic Bethany Base and manages to do so by self-destructing her own unit and barely escaping.<br /><br />As Shinji and his father Gendo visit their dead mother, Yui's grave, the new Unit-02 has arrived to the base and we are introduced to its abrasive, confident pilot, Asuka Langley Shikinami.  Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Ryoji Kaji delivers an object in a suitcase to Gendo known as the \\"Key of Nebuchadnezzar\\".<br /><br />As for Shinji and Asuka, their first meeting doesn't go quite well as Asuka kicks Shinji and looks at him as a weakling who only got his position because he's the son of Gendo.  Asuka ends up moving in with Misato Katsuragi and Shiji Ikari (along with Pen Pen the Penguin) and takes up Shinji's room.  While Shinji tries to be much more open to Asuka, she can't stand being near him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Shinji, Rei, Asuka and Shinji's two high school friends try to socialize and have fun.  Together they visit a research aquarium which tries to maintain and resuscitate ocean ecosystems lost in the Second Impact.  But as everyone tries to become used to their social life at school and with each other, all three Evangelions are called into battle to engage on the Eight Angel and a test for Shinji, Asuka and Rei to work as a team and they suffer major damages.  Unfortunatel, SEELE has declared that the Unit-00 has served its purpose and no longer needs to be repaired.<br /><br />As for Gendo, he and Fuyutsuki visit the Tabgha Base to view SEELE's progress on the creation of Evangelion Mark.06 and they see the mysterious Kawaoru Nagisa sitting on its finger.<br /><br />As things seem to be quiet and no new attacks are happening, Rei really wants to bring Shinji and his father together.  At first Gendo tells Rei that he is too busy but he see's Yui telling him to be there for his son and he agrees.  So, Reiwith the help of Misato begin to invite people to the dinner party.<br /><br />On the day of the dinner party, it is learned that Evangelion Unit-04 and NERV's U.S. branch are destroyed while testing an experimental engine, meanwhile the U.S. government has completed Unit-03 has has sent it to Tokyo.  Because of the \\"Vatican Treaty\\" which allows countries to possess only three functioning Evangelions at at a time, the Unit-02 is sealed away.  Rei is chosen to pilot the new Eva but Asuka offers to do it as Rei can host the dinner party.<br /><br />As Asuka pilots the Unit-03, upon activation, something goes wrong and it is revealed that the Unit has been possessed by the Ninth Angel and unfortunately, with Asuka inside, Shinji must pilot his EVA and destroy it.  But Shinji is unwilling to have Asuka's blood in his hands and his father gives him a direct order which Shinji is unwilling to do.  So, Gendo gives the order to activate the dummy system and Shinji would no longer have access to control the EVA.  We then see the EVA fighting on its own as it destroys the Ninth Angel and Shinji cries and screams of how his father can use him in such a way.  Shinji's EVA ends up crushing Asuka's entry plug and we see Shinji, disgusted by his father and NERV's actions, quitting NERV.<br /><br />While Asuka survives but is deeply wounded and fears that she may have been contaminated by an Angel and with Shinji gone, the Tenth Angel comes to attack.  But unfortunately, without Shinji, the Unit-01 refuses to activate the dummy system and thus, the new pilot Mari ends up hijacking Unit-02 to fight the Tenth Angel on her own.<br /><br />Who will live?  Who will die? Will Shinji be the same after what happened?<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition. I had the opportunity to compare the Blu-ray to the 2.22 DVD release from FUNimation Entertainment from last fall and I can tell you right now that this Blu-ray looks fantastic. Detail is much more apparent and the vibrancy of the colors of the film literally pop onscreen. The CG animation is top notch and overall, Gainax definitely went all out in creating a fantastic anime full of detail, vibrant colors and staying faithful to the anime series but making sure everything is updated and looks amazing.<br /><br />But I will say that while the majority of the film featured animation perfection, right when the film begins as we are introduced to Maki, that scene displays some banding.  And while the scene is not long at all, that was the only scene where I found anything that can be deemed as negative by videophiles.  I saw no artifacts, black levels were great and colors were vibrant.  But the animation and just the newer footage just looks incredible.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 6.1 English and Japanese lossless soundtrack and there is good use of all channels. From hearing the music and main character vocal coming from the center and front channels, you will then hear the loudspeakers through the surround channels and then the rear surround channels carry audio that is different. For example, in one scene in which Shinji screaming out of his Eva, you hear the main characters and vocals through the center and front channels, loud speakers and musical instruments on the surround and on the rear surround channel, you hear Shinji screaming in agony behind you.<br /><br />There is so much action and destruction featured in this second film that there is good use of LFE.  Personally, the lossless audio is just phenomenal, how it is so immersive and envelops the soundscape from all directions was fantastic. And I am so happy to find out that the Japanese audio track is lossless as well. Something that fans have wanted from anime on Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for the dubbing, both soundtracks are well-done and it's great that FUNimation used the majority ofthe original cast for the film.  While I do feel that the Japanese soundtrack is able to capture the more desperate emotions quite well, the English voice actors did a wonderful job in this release as well.  Personally, it all comes to preference and whichever lossless soundtrack that you choose, they are both excellent.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the subtitles on the Blu-ray are in English only.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" contains the following special features:<br /><br />  * US Cast Commentary - I found this audio commentary to be fantastic.  Similar to what ADR Director Mike McFarland did with the \\"Fullmetal Alchemist\\" film and giving 10-15 minutes for each voice actor, he does the same with this audio commentary as we hear voice talent (even some we haven't heard from for awhile) to talk about the characters, the changes and difference from the original TV series from the films.  Very insightful and fun to listen to (AFTER) you watched the movie as there are some spoilers.<br />  * Rebuild of Evangelion 2.02 - (22:22) A montage of pre-production sketches, renders and final renders.<br />  * \\"I Would Give You Anything Scene (Noguchi ver.) - (4:58) This segment features a different singer it appears for the song \\"Tsubasa wo Kudasai\\".  It's actually much better but I think the director wanted a voice that was not so polished and capturing more of a raw singing vocal for that scene.<br />  * Omitted Scenes - A total of four omitted scenes.<br />  * Original Trailer - (1:22) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\".<br />  * Train Channel Spot - (:14) Another teaser trailer for \\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\".<br />  * Japanese TV Spots - (1:38) TV spots for \\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\".<br />  * Blu-ray and DVD - TV Spot Type A (:17), TV Spot Type B (:17), Promotion Reel (1:57)<br />  * FUNimation Entertainment Trailers<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" comes with a special, embossed slip over case cover (with open flap).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I first heard that the rebuild of \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" would take place and that these new films would be based on the television series, I wasn't so surprised because the series is so popular that it would definitely generate an extreme amount of money for GAINAX. But one thing that I was not looking forward and what drove me crazy about the TV series was the character of Shinji Ikari. Back in the mid-90's, I can easily remember how his whining really tested my patience and looking back, he was such an anti-hero, mainly because he was \\"emo\\" most of the time. Always negative, always in a bit of depression and funk as he always felt people didn't care about him (and yes, I know that Hideaki Anno was clinically depressed when he was creating this film and parts of show was based on his depression) but it did get on my nerves at the time.<br /><br />But here we are 15 years later and here I am watching \\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" and loving every minute of it.<br /><br />Yes, Shinji still whines but its more tolerable in the film version.  Changes were made to make him slightly less whiny and more courageous.  The film is structured a bit differently from the anime TV series and somehow, the pacing is much easier to take for the viewer with the film version and felt that the screenplay for the first film, the quality of the animation and artistic backgrounds and the music all worked together fantastically.  I found myself happy and content with this sequel and even enjoyed it much more than the first film (which was awesome) and  I look forward to seeing how Anno and the GAINAX crew tweaks the next film.<br /><br />I was quite amazed to see the number of changes that were implemented in the second film.  To see the new character Maki, to see the new designs for the EVA units and Angels and tosee changes in the storyline (including Asuka's last name), not to say that the storyline was completely redone but there were significant changes and I will say how much I loved the storyline for this second film and the changes that were done over the TV series.  I'm sure purists will have problems with the changes but seriously, I love where the film is going and how things are structured.  Also, the animation and voice acting is absolutely wonderful!<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, this release was just fantastic. Not entirely perfect as there is slight banding but for the majority of the film, picture quality was awesome and I love the 6.1 lossless soundtrack.  The soundtrack was much better this time around for both vocal tracks and I loved how the channels, including the surround, rear surround and LFE were used for this film.  As for special features, they are short but the biggest addition was the commentary track and it was good thinking by ADR director Mike McFarland to interview as many voice talent as possible.  I really enjoyed the commentary track.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, it was definitely great to see Evangelion sporting newer animation, CG, artwork and a solid screenplay and soundtrack. But most importantly, done in the way that the director Hideaki Anno had wanted and so far, the majority of fans have been supportive of the storyline thus far. And after I watched this second film, I can tell you that I loved every minute of it! The action, the drama is still intact. Things may be a little different but still, fans of the original series will definitely enjoy this film release.<br /><br />\\"Evangelion: 2.22 - You Can (Not) Advance\\" will surprise you.

B0041T52S6|3.0|one of the absolute worst movies ever to be viewed by an adult  Rated 5-8 for 5-8 year olds who might get a kick out of this movie.    so if you want something for such a 5-8 yr old youngster as say a present  it's maybe a 5 star event    for everyone else, it just stinks.  1992 Mothra vs Godzilla is better by a long shot    it's a silly movie with the acting by the main character absolutely rotten.  If you could get it for .01 with free shipping and you have no 5-8 yr olds to view it or give it to,    you just wasted space and .01    so for a select small group, 5 stars  for everyone else with even a semblance of a brain, 1 star    what an awful movie

Based on the fairy tale \\"Rapunzel\\" by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the film adaptation is directed by Nathan Greno (\\"Bolt\\", \\"Meet the Robinsons\\", \\"Chicken Little\\", \\"Mulan\\") with Byron Howard (\\"Chicken Little\\", \\"Brotehr Bear\\", \\"Lilo & Stitch\\", \\"Mulan\\", \\"Pocahontas\\") and a screenplay by Dan Fogelman (\\"Bolt\\", \\"Cars\\", \\"Fred Claus\\").<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" would feature the voices of Mandy Moore (\\"A Walk to Remember\\", \\"Saved\\", \\"The Princess Diaries\\"), Zachary Levi (\\"Chuck\\", \\"Less Than Perfect\\", \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel\\"), Donna Murphy (\\"The Fountain\\", \\"Spider-Man 2', \\"Trust Me\\"), Ron Perlman (\\"Hellboy\\" films, \\"Sons of Anarchy\\", \\"Chronus\\"), M.C. Gainey (\\"Beerfest\\", \\"Sideways\\", \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\"), Jeffrey Tambor (\\"The Hangover\\", \\"Arrested Development\\", \\"The Larry Sanders Show\\") and Brad Garrett (\\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\", \\"`Til Death\\", \\"Ratatouille\\").<br /><br />The film was a success in the box office as the $260 million film would make over $551 million worldwide and has received mostly positive reviews from film critics.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 Aspect Ratio) and I don't think anyone has found anything negative to say about a modern Disney animated film on Blu-ray and the same can be said for \\"Tangled\\".  Immediately when you start watching \\"Tangled\\", you are greeted with vibrant colors, black levels are nice and fine detail crammed into every frame.  From the detail on the trees, to the detail of Rapunzel's hair, watching the folds on the clothing of the characters to the details of the Tower, the greenery...\\"Tangled\\" features colors and detail galore.<br /><br />If there was one scene that really caught my eyes was during the chase scene (which applies to audio as well).  The way the mountains look, the way the water looks, even down to the grain of the wood, \\"Tangled\\" looked absolutely fantastic.  I was very impressed by the animation for this film.<br /><br />I detected no artifacting, digital noise, edge enhancement but I did detect slight banding in two spots.  One where both Flynn and Rapunzel were sitting near a camp fire and another scene with a lot of red.  It was noticeable but aside from those short moments, I detected nothing that would have spoiled the film.<br /><br />Personally, for the majority of the film, \\"Tangled\\" was a visual feast and I was quite impressed by how detailed the film was but also how much went into the physics for Rapunzel's hair.  Overall, awesome PQ!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio, French  Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD NR and English 2.0 DVS.  While not as strong as other Disney action-based films, still \\"Tangled\\" is no slouch as you can hear the wind, plants rustling, the stomping of the hooves of Maximus, the arrows being shot by the guards who are trying to get Flynn Rider and the bumps and slams into Flynn Rider's noggin from the pan used by Rapunzel.<br /><br />But possibly the best segment where LFE, surround and rear-surround channels come into play is the chase scene when the guards and Maximus are going after Flynn and Rapunzel.  That was quite impressive audio-wise!<br /><br />So, there are many moments of immersive audio that you can hear from the surround channels but because this is not an all-action film, one can expect crisp dialogue through the center channels and the score by Alan Menken as well as the music from \\"Tangled\\" through the front channels but also at times utilizing the surround and rear-surround channels.<br /><br />The lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate for a film like \\"Tangled\\" and I don't think anyone can be disappointed by it.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - (12:36) Featuring three deleted scenes: The Jaunty Moose, Chemistry Develops and Vigor the Visionary featuring intros by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard on why the scenes were cut.  Note: Scenes are sketches and not 3D rendered.<br />  * Original Storybook Opening - Originally, the film would feature a storybook opening but the directors felt they wanted to do something different.  So, included are the the two storybook openings version 1 (3:57) and version 2 (4:02).<br />  * 50th Animated Feature Countdown - (2:03) A countdown featuring clips of all 50 Disney Animated films.<br />  * Extended Songs - Featuring the extended songs \\"When Will My Life Begin\\" (3:35) and \\"Mother Knows Best\\" (4:12) with intro by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.<br />  * Untangled - The Making of a Fairy Tale - (12:28) Featuring the making of \\"Tangled\\" hosted by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi.<br />  * Tangled Teasers - (9:12) Featuring nine animated teasers for \\"Tangled\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" comes with a slip-over cardboard case.  The accompanying DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1), English & Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and English 2.0 DVS with subtitles in English SDH and French Subtitles.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />This is an update to my previous review as I decided that I had to watch this film again as the first time, I felt I was concentrating too much on the visuals but this time around, I wanted to embrace the musical side to the film as well and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Not only did I enjoy it much more the second time, I just realized how awesome this Blu-ray release is by just really focusing on the lossless soundtrack and just finding that right position where the sound effects, especially the music just came alive.<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" turned out to be a wonderful, delightful animated film by Disney and a wonderful experience that had that romantic comedy but yet darker and magical feel such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and even \\"Snow White\\".<br /><br />And as mentioned earlier in my review, this is a wonderful Disney film that wasn't made by Pixar and perhaps that is a good thing because Disney animated classics have built themselves upon fantasy and adventure and what best to have their 50th animated film to carry on the tradition that Walt Disney had done long ago for his films and that is to have a film that can entertain people of all ages but to also to have elements based on a well-written script.<br /><br />Sure, John Lasseter may have had his hand in this film as an executive producer but you have to give credit to directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, especially screenwriter Dan Fogelman for taking on a well-known fairy tale and making an enjoyable film out of it.  Personally, I felt that the creators and staff were able to create a fresh and innovative storyline based on the fairy tale of \\"Rapunzel\\" but not make it so kitschy and keeping it fun, humorous and even heartfelt.<br /><br />While a few may have felt that it was wrong for Disney to use the title of \\"Rapunzel\\" and go with the title of \\"Tangled\\", I can understand why they did it.  With \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", many felt the film did skew towards a younger female demographic and \\"Rapunzel\\" would have probably done the same.  Enough of the foolishness of even debating about the name, focus on the film and you realize how fantastic of an animated film \\"Tangled\\" truly is.<br /><br />This time, you have Rapunzel and the swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider and you have a film that the boys and girls will love, but throw in a few deeper and slightly darker elements to make the film rated PG and you have all the ingredients to make a wonderful animated film.<br /><br />The voice acting for the film was wonderful.  Both Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi have wonderful chemistry ala voice acting and for the most part, the characters and the talented hired for the filmwere well-cast by Disney.  I'm not sure who did the singing voice for Rapunzel (as I know Mandy Moore can sing) and even for Flynn (can Zachary Levi sing?), but will say that I was quite pleased with both talent's voice acting performance.<br /><br />The musical score by Alan Menken was actually quite memorable and like he has done for animated films like \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Aladdin\\", the music is quite strong.  The musical numbers for \\"Tangled\\" are catchy and fun but while the music and the songs really provided a wonderful backdrop to the awesome visuals.  At first, I felt that I was unfair to the music as I kept complimenting the visuals but the second time around, I made it priority to listen to the music and I found myself absolutely loving it.  Menken really created music that complimented the film and once again, he has done a fabulous job.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Tangled\\" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and the music and lossless audio soundtrack is wonderful and works for this type of film.  While there are a good amount of special features with this release, I have to admit that I was a bit surprised as I was expecting a whole lot more (as Disney tends to spoil you with a lot of special features) for \\"Tangled\\".  But still, that's after years of being spoiled by Blu-ray releases from Disney but for what was included, there are still a good number of special features to keep viewers busy.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Tangled\\" is a delightful film that will entertain families although because it's rated PG and does nearly show a death scene, it was a necessary move by Disney that made the film work.  The film still manages to display the magic of Walt Disney through it's look and feel and also continuing the tradition of quality with its Blu-ray releases as \\"Tangled\\" simply looks beautiful and sounds great via HD.<br /><br />While not as special features heavy as I would have hoped (and expected) to see from a Walt Disney film, \\"Tangled\\" is still an enjoyable and wonderful film for the entire family and I definitely recommend it!that is a good thing because Disney animated classics have built themselves upon fantasy and adventure and what best to have their 50th animated film to carry on the tradition that Walt Disney had done long ago for his films and that is to have a film that can entertain people of all ages but to also to have elements based on a well-written script.

B002YOJBYG|5.0|Great Cast and Production!  I had the old 2004 DVD pressing but there were too many problems.  This 2010 pressing is excellent...better video and audio.  You will NEVER see a cast like this ever again!!!
B004P29LEU|4.0|In 1993, the romantic comedy \\"Benny & Joon\\" became a hit for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  The film would showcase the physical comedy of Johnny Depp (fresh from his hit film \\"Edward Scissorhands\\") and its theme song \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles\\" by the Proclaimers.<br /><br />And while there was a little backstage drama behind-the-scenes as Winona Ryder who just broke up with Depp was supposed to play \\"Joon\\" and Woody Harrelson was to play the role of \\"Benny\\". The roles were re-cast and Aidan Quinn would be playing \\"Benny\\" and Mary Stuart Masterson as \\"Joon\\".<br /><br />The film would also feature talent who would eventually become popular stars years later with William H. Macy as Randy, Oliver Platt as Eric and Julianne Moore as Ruthie.<br /><br />Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (\\"Burn Notice\\", \\"Gossip Girl\\", \\"The Avengers\\", \\"Chuck\\") and a screenplay by Barry Berman (\\"Waterproof\\", \\"The Adventures of Pinocchio\\"), \\"Benny & Joon\\" would earn $23 million and also earn Johnny Depp a Golden Globe Award nomination.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Benny & Joon\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  As part of the catalog titles that are being released by MGM/20th Century Fox, I can say that this film does look better than its DVD counterpart but at the same time, does feature dust and speckles from time to time.  For the most part, the film does look very good.  The outdoor scenes are vibrant, the darker outdoor scenes or vignette type scenes have really good inky blacks.<br /><br />And while colors are vibrant and there is good contrast for this film on Blu-ray, I do believe a lot of these catalog titles which include \\"Benny & Joon\\" are most likely sourced from an old HD master which was originally used for the DVD release.  But it does look better than its DVD counterpart and that is a plus.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Benny & Joon\\" is presented in English 2.0 Surround DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Dolby Surround.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and the music, including the Proclaimers \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\" comes clear through the front channels.  But it's a decent lossless soundtrack that is appropriate for this film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Benny & Joon\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Jeremiah Chechik.  Chechik talks about the timelessness of the film and not so much of the technical parts of the film.  We learn how the photo of a young Aidan Quinn and Masterson was created, how the film was shot on location and more.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (5:12) Featuring two deleted scenes: audition and mutilator.<br />  * Costume, Make-Up Test and Stunt Reel - (18:45)Featuring various costume and make-up tests with the talent and a commentary track.<br />  * Music Video - (3:40) Featuring the music video \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\" by The Proclaimers.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:01) Featuring the original theatrical trailer to \\"Benny & Joon\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />It has been nearly 20-years since I have watched \\"Benny & Joon\\", a romantic comedy that was pretty cool for it's time because it didn't have the typical displays of banality of a romantic comedy.  And the fact that you have a female character who is mentally ill and a young man who probably lived his life watching movies and literally transformed himself to be a hybrid Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin type of actor.  And then you throw in the older brother who has not been able to live his life because he had to care for his younger sister.<br /><br />\\"Benny & Joon\\" was a film that felt natural and when I first watched it, I found it intriguing, enjoyable and hilarious.  I also credit the film for introducing me Buster Keaton and eventually making me become a silent film fan at a younger age.  But \\"Benny & Joon\\" is a film that is timeless.  Nearly 20-years-later and sure, the talents are much older but the film doesn't look like it has aged.  The storyline remains fun, relevant, enjoyable and I have not grown tired of it yet.<br /><br />I felt that the younger Johnny Depp showed an amazing brilliance of what kind of actor he would later become in this film.  The physical comedy and capturing that Keaton/Chaplin-esque style was fantastic and the same can be said with the brother and sister chemistry between Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, there is nothing new added to this Blu-ray release and as mentioned, I wouldn't be surprised if the HD master was what was prepped for the DVD release.  Fortunately, PQ is good and I didn't find any artifacting and for the most part, if you loved the film on DVD, it's worth upgrading to Blu-ray.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Benny & Joon\\" is a romantic comedy that remains honest, fun and enjoyable after all these years.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the film a lot back then and even now, I do wish the Blu-ray release had a better HD transfer and newer special features but if you really enjoyed \\"Benny & Joon\\" and have not owned it on DVD or LD prior, then definitely give this Blu-ray release a chance!enjoyable and I have not grown tired of it yet.

B0000AK7AB|5.0|Is it pointless to write a review on a movie that was produced 15 years ago? Or that was nominated for a slew of Oscar awards, and has therefore already generated a litany of viewer reviews covering every aspect of the movie? Or whose simplicity belies a richness and intricacy that defies simple explanation? Indeed, it probably is. But as we approach the two-decade mark since Babe was released, I'd nevertheless like to take a moment to write just why this movie is one of the most powerful and touching I've ever seen.<br /><br />Babe is thought of as a kid's movie, and, in some ways, it is. But it's a mistake to sum this work up as solely a kid's movie. This is a movie that strikes deep into the soul and heart of the viewer, one that pricks at some of the basic undercurrents of life itself, and forces one to rethink these deep issues through the lens of innocence, honesty, and curiosity. Yes, it's delightful; yes, its funny; indeed, its charming. But it is far more than that. This work deeply challenges us to think about \\"the way things are,\\" and brings forth some of the realities of life in a way that few movies ever do. Yes, kids can watch this and enjoy it from beginning to end. But virtually any adult should be able to see within its first five minutes that this is not your typical movie \\"fare\\" - kid or otherwise - and that the story has an emotive power and subtext that is both completely unexpected and incredibly rich.<br /><br />The story in Babe is straightforward. A pig ends up on a farm, tries to figure out his \\"place\\" on that farm, eventually discovers that he, too, has a place there, in spite of his own fears that he might not. Oh, yes, and he's a talented creature, too. That's about it.<br /><br />Actually, that's the main storyline that supports a magical world of powerful, emotional, and thought-provoking events, a laboratory test tube of the greater world that has more the trappings of a gilded box than a rabbit's cage. But even the entertaining and unusual events of the movie are only the setting for the more important themes of the storyline.  Throughout of the story, Babe is faced with a series of realities that challenge his innocence at every turn and threaten to change his sweet nature into a cynical outlook towards all things human and animal.  Repeatedly, the pig must make a choice between trust and bitterness as his knowledge of his world expands. He is enticed by a duck trying to rescue his own life through a criminal act; is tormented by a self-serving cat undertaking revenge; and is threatened by a mean-spirited, jealous dog who is living with a life disappointment that colors his daily experience.<br /><br />Babe is befriended by a man, a quiet and diminutive sheep-herder farmer, an unexceptional person who nonetheless somehow senses something unusual about this pig. The sheep-herder-farmer becomes the laughing stock of his friends, family, and community, but is nonetheless undeterred via a \\"common sense of destiny.\\" That destiny is threatened throughout the story, but although recognized only by Babe and the farmer, that destiny is seen by both through to the end, and we are all the wiser in seeing them do so.<br /><br />So what is \\"Babe\\" about? It is about innocence, openness, prejudice, kindness, belief, fairness, and acceptance. But it is about more than that. It is also about sadness, tragedy, endurance, and guilt. It's about \\"the way things are.\\" And the way that, perhaps, things should be.<br /><br />So, let the kids watch it and enjoy, and enjoy they will. The talking animals, the cuteness of the characters, and the gorgeously played and recorded music is a delightful romp through a magical world of enchanted reality. But as you watch it yourself, be drawn into the thought and reflection surrounding the messages of the film, and reflect on what it means. You'll find it is not a simple, cute movie at all: it's the deepest of examinations of human experience masquerading as kids' entertainment. You'll thoroughly enjoy it, but I assure you, it won't end there.u, it won't end there.
0739383728|5.0|Very motivational--if you are thinking about running you gotta read this book.    At this point so many great reviews have been written that there isn't anything more that I can add.  And this becomes another affirmative vote.    Except for don't spend a lot of money on chia seeds.  Chia seeds while nutritious, they alone won't make you a great runner.  :-)
B004DK5CYM|4.0|I have always loved stories about the underdog that no none believes in coming ahead to victory. Wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy. It makes a person believe that you should never give up and you should believe in yourself, and don't give up on the one you love no matter how bleak it may seem.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This album is so good it makes my head hurt. Recorded authentically with lots of loud guitars on analog tape without software and protools manipulation! It sounds like you're hearing the band play live in the studio! It's so awesome to see band put out a solid start-to-finish complete record of GREAT SONGS! Dave's songwriting never disappoints and this album is a testament to the Foo Fighter's straight up delivery that never fails.
B004L49K20|5.0|terrific!!! This album should be in the list of the best albums of 2011 at the end of the year!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have to agree. This is a very nice PDF reader. It feels like you have powerful desktop features with a slick mobile interface. Definitely worth the price if you regularly read PDFs on the go.
B001E45XT4|2.0|I have a lot of friends with the Turtle Beach headsets for Xbox 360 and I was quite proud to find these headphones for less than half the price with very similar usefulness.  These headphones were great for my set-up, just plug the green speaker cable into my monitor and using a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter plug the microphone jack into my controller.  Boom, ready to roll.  No RCA cables, no usb power cable, no heavy dongles with extra wires coming out.    However, that's about when the honeymoon ended.  These headphones are bulky.  I have a pretty small head, so maybe it's just me, but I agree with other reviewers in saying it's like wearing tin cans on my head.  The sound was decent, especially for $25.  After about 2-months of moderate use, the left ear-cup went out.  I have no clue how this came about as I never dropped it or mishandled it.  Playing deaf in one ear is unacceptable, so these are going in the trash and I went out and bought some Sharkoons--which are quite nice so far, though lots more cables :( .
B000002LFZ|4.0|CD had a scratch causing a popular song not to play.   Overall the product was O K for the price.
B004SBX112|1.0|During the game, advertisements, not so cleverly disguised as Rovio News appear. These ads have included ads for other Rovio products as well as for the upcoming movie \\"Rio\\". UNINSTALLED...    Guess what? I no longer waste time on this game.  Thanks Rovio for putting ads in your ad-free version which prompted me to get rid of the game and reclaim my llife
B004SC7B6M|3.0|Within Temptation is one of those bands that is easily accessible to just about everyone.  Their music is catchy, they know their instruments, and Sharon is an amazing singer.  That being said, I was originally quite disappointed with this album.  There are catchy songs, to be sure, but as a whole the album lacks the musical variety that makes the band unique.  Within Temptation had moved away from the softer, more haunting, \\"gothic\\"-style of \\"Mother Earth\\" and \\"The Silent Force\\" awhile ago.  However, even the more-produced \\"The Heart of Everything\\" (my favorite album) contains more variety than does \\"The Unforgiving.\\"    That said, \\"The Unforgiving\\" is a solid album which has grown some on me.  \\"Shot in the Dark\\", \\"Faster\\", and \\"Sinead\\" showcase the best of the more mainstream style that Within Temptation is moving towards: great singing and catchy melodies.  \\"Sinead\\" in particular tends to get very stuck in my head.  \\"Fire and Ice\\" borders on being a slow song (begins slow and then speeds up) with some of the better lyrics on the album (\\"And I still wonder why heaven has died?\\")  It perhaps lacks the music depth of other truer slow songs of Within Temptation (\\"Our Farewell\\" and \\"Memories\\") but it is a powerful song.  \\"Murder\\" and \\"A Demon's Fate\\" are the two songs on the album that hint at a more haunting, gothic sound while still in the more pop mainstream style.  The violins at the beginning of \\"Murder\\" are a nice touch, though, for an album that generally lacks much showcasing of classical instruments.    Most of the other songs on the album which I did not address are essentially throw-away songs.  I honestly have a hard time remembering one from another because very little stands out.  \\"Lost\\" is the one attempt at an actual slow song but it is just not very good, to put it lightly.  I feel like many of the songs have the feel of 80s power ballads (not necessarily a bad thing but certainly not traditional WT).  While listening to this album, I often find myself wondering what the songs would sound like acoustically or less-produced.  It is possible that what has changed has simply been the amount of production put into them and if they were simplified, maybe they would retain that unique Within Temptation sound.  I'm not sure.  I guess we'll have to wait for the acoustic versions.  Overall, I think this is an album that may disappoint hard-core WT fans who have high standards for the band.  For new comers to the band, especially fans of more mainstream rock, this may offer a bridge into the wonderful world of European rock.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The reason the music business is in shambles has nothing to do with piracy.  The problem is that there is virtually no talent who merits our hard earned money.  Seems nowadays, any wasteoid with an Autotune gets a contract and airplay.  If there were more talent like The Foo Fighters in the industry, music as a whole would not be the complete crapfest it is today, people would spend their money to buy the music, and the talent would reap the benefits of their hard work.  I'm willing to fork over the money for these guys, because I haven't been burned by them yet.  They're always good! This CD is great from the first song to the last...absolutely no duds.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|As a Grunge era 45 year young kinda guy.    Just when you thought Miley, Brittney, Lady Goo Goo, Adam Lambert and the rest of the Mickey Mouse Club and Hip Hopsters have taken over the airwaves..... Not so fast baby, here come Dave and the Boys to save the Rock Music World. This is by far the best Rock album to come out in years from any Rock Artist period!!! The Grunge esk sound, hard guitars, Taylor's snare smashing, Dave's lyrics and voice and..... YES, Pats back make this album a freak of nature.     Thank you Dave, Pat, Nate, Taylor and Chris for keeping Rock alive. Wasting Light is your Black Album.......     Best Album in years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00138J32O|5.0|I am upset that some fans didn't give this album a chance.  Unless you are stuck in the 80's this is their finest most current album since we were in the 80's.  It's time for people to let go of \\" Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and \\"Rio\\".  They are 30 years older and sounding better than ever!  The dance track \\"Tempted\\" is one of my favorites.  Also love Red Carpet Massacre, Box full of Honey, Last Man Standing, etc., etc.  Give it a chance and more than one listen.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This film is spectacular. Anyone who has ever stolen even a pack of gum will love this film. It appeals to the thief/criminal in all of us. Also, the cast is perfect. The film transcends its time and is a certain classic. Aside from its amazing conclusion, the film's music alone will make the viewer want to watch it again.<br /><br />A message for those who've seen The Usual Suspects: Dean Keaton is not who we think he is. Watch closely to understand his true intentions. Also, Michaelmatician states that Kobayashi indeed works for DeDonde Inc. and is very real.<br /><br />2.342<br /><br />\\"We Will Learn To See The Michrotron.\\"
B004R13U6Y|5.0|One of the great selling points of this pdf reader is the text-to-speech, highlighting and annotating features of this program. It works very well and especially for those who like to read on the go.     To test the text-to-speech, I converted a word document to PDF with Primo PDF. ezPDF was able to recognize the text of this document. However, small note- if you're just trying to read scanned PDFs, make sure you have the Adobe OCR recognition option on or else the text-to-speech engine on ezPDF will not work.     I uninstalled Adobe Reader as soon I got ezPDF. Well worth it for the .99!
0307477479|5.0|Jennifer Egan never ceases to surprise me with her vivid characters and beautiful prose.  What makes this book verge on revolutionary is the style in which she chose to write it.   Loosely based on a Proustian theory that we all revisit certain places in the hopes of recapturing a precious memory, Egan proves that the beauty in those rare fleeting moments can never truly be anything but wistful nostalgia.  True to her nature, she writes from every different perspective, switching narratives and jumping between past, present and future so rapidly, you begin to lose track of which characters are supposed to be central, which timeline is the present.    It's the kind of book that you wish had a soundtrack, too, snippets of songs dancing through the scenes with a mention here, a longing there.   It makes you laugh, cry, remember your favorite songs, all those perfect moments when everything was right in the world, untainted by future devastation or loss, and above all, A Visit From the Goon Squad makes you dread the last page.    Just another treasured memory in a long winding life.
0545265355|5.0|I hardly every write reviews, but I have to say that this trilogy is truly captivating. I heard about these books from a girlfriend of mine who was obsessed with the Twilight stories and I kind of wrote off the recommendation. However, I came across the book at the airport and read the whole series in 4 days!!! The story, the plot, the characters become real and gritty and heart-wrenching. A psychologist by nature, I think about Katniss and her hierarchy of needs. The way she thinks and the way the story unfolds speaks very realistic to what her situation has put her through.     Collins is a master of words and I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a great adventure despite the gory nature of the story!
0446567337|4.0|Another great Nicholas Sparks book, but it is my least favorite of his. Don't get me wrong-it was sweet and all, but it had so much dialogue (especially at the beginning) and it was written from just his perspective. It worked-to keep some of the reasons for what happened hidden, but I felt it was very one sided-his perspective. It would have been more interesting if the story had been told from her perspective-that's just how I feel.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I was very delighted when I got this adapter, and it worked great for about 2 months. After that, the connector came off one day while disconnecting the adapter from the macbook pro, and the wires got exposed. I put it back together, and it continued to work for a few more times off and on, and then finally it stopped working completely. I bought this after reading so many positive reviews, and payed the extra money ($35 compared to $8-10 devices). I would not recommend this to anybody.
B001NLKT60|5.0|i could not put down this story. i kept guessing until the end and cannot wait to read the next installment in the series. A must have for any mystery/thriller enthusiast.
0394800389|4.0|When I first bought this book, I thought it was just another Seuss book, but it is not! At first I hated it and would try to persuade my son into making Daddy read it instead of Mommy, but many nights we would both end up reading it. After having done it so much, it's a breeze now, but it does take some getting used to!
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein succinctly lays out the scenario for the onslaught of Friedmanian economic terrorism that is the basis for our current crisis.  I had read it 3 years ago, and felt it was valuable enough to purchase as gifts for two different friends. It's unequivocally a must read!
B0002ADY1A|5.0|This is a record that really qualifies as an unmitigated success. For years, I had thought Heep to be a poor man's version of Deep Purple, and in some respects, the parallels are somewhat obvious, but after re-discovering them in the past year or so, I find a group (of their time) whom really had a distinctive and consistent sound collectively as a most intriguing quality. Being their fourth release after the good and solid Look At Yourself set, Demons begins to show Ken Hensley as a major writer within the ranks of Heep. He did, after all, pen one of their best known hits in Easy Livin' and Circle of Hands, Rainbow Demon and Paradise/The Spell only further attest to this declaration. But, of course, without Byron, Box, Kerslake and Gary Thain, these ideals wouldn't have been realised. Check out the impeccable ensemble's work on tracks like Traveller in Time, Poet's Justice and the leadoff cut, The Wizard. I would say there are ,overall, some great albums by the Heepsters, but nothing can match the era of THIS group of members(72-75). The Sanctuary remaster is highly recommended, not only for the remix, but also for the bonus tracks. It gives the listener an insight into what worked for the group, and perhaps, what didn't.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|I ordered the black&white DVD of Mildred Pierce. It arrived exactly as it was described in the ad.  Packaging was fine and it arrived earlier than I had anticipated.  The DVD was in great condition after I played it....it was like brand new.  Thank you!.
B000MTOLDG|5.0|This is drummer Mikkey Dee's first full length album with Lemmy, Phil and Wurzel. And its easy to see why he's remained Motorhead's drummer ever since!! Check out barnstormers like the opening cut, On Your Feet or On Your Knees. Its obvious that Mikkey injected some new life into the band and it continues to punish you on the next four tracks. Burner churns and twists and scorches, Death or Glory has speed and punch. I am the Sword is archetypical Motorhead, and Born to Raise Hell is yet another anthem in the band's pulverising canon. Don't let Daddy Kiss Me is a great tune about child abuse, though a bit awkward within the wealth of this set. The remaining tracks Bad Woman, Liar, I'm Your Man, We Bring the Shake and Devils are just breathtakingly consistent and help to crown this record as one of the best they've done in their career. Lost in the Ozone is a slower track, but all the more powerful and pondering in its intent. Unfortunately, Bastards came out on a small German based label ZYX and didn't get the proper distribution it deserved here in the States. Nevertheless, its still available here through different music retailers on Amazon and THANK GOD!! I absolutely love this album, it even surpasses 1916 and I feel fits right in with Ace of Spades, Bomber and Overkill as one of Motorhead's top albums....Highly Recommended....

B003VA3JUO|5.0|This underrated film of a ship found adrift at sea is a blend of modern horror and old-fashioned storytelling. It moves the familiar haunted house story to the ocean with more emphasis on atmosphere and story than most present day horror films. Other than a somewhat gory opening scene the viewer must see as background, there is an understated old-style atmosphere and performances which works well.<br /><br />When a close-knit salvage crew led by Gabriel Byrne agree to go treasure hunting based on photos of an unknown ship drifting deep in the remote Bering Sea, they have no idea what lies ahead. Even the hardened Murphy (Byrne), who has seen strange things at sea, is shocked when what appears and disappears in the dark chilly sea on their radar screens turns out to be the Italian luxury liner Antonia Graza, drifting like a dark and elegant ghost. She is a maritime mystery, vanishing without explanation or trace decades before.<br /><br />Epps (Julianne Marguiles) is the first of the crew to realize something onboard is very wrong, when she sees a sweet young girl who cannot possibly be there. Director Steve Beck does a nice job capturing for the viewer the sense of eerie wonder and anticipation exploring a dark, drifting ship deep in the ocean, thousands of miles from nowhere, brings. As the crew begin to explore the Graza, tension builds and we feel a sense of doom. So does the crew, but just when they are ready to boogie out of there, gold is found, and keeps them aboard.<br /><br />The elegance and style of the original voyage is nicely captured in flashbacks, and adds dimension to the dreary present day salvage operation. Despite the fact this is a horror film of sorts, it is set design rather than special effects which drive it, and make it fun to watch. Marguiles does a nice job, as does Italian beauty Francesca Rettondini in her much too brief flashbacks. Emily Browning, as the young Katie, trying to protect Epps and her crew because she is not like the \\"others\\" is very good also.<br /><br />The gory flashback which opens the film is more shocking than bloody, but still way too much for younger audiences. It does, however, add to the adult viewer's enjoyment of the story in a way, giving the moviegoer empathy for young Katie's tragic fate. Picked off one by one, she may be the only hope for the remaining. The story has style and is told in an old-fashioned manner. While some elements may be predictable, it is done with understatement and visual flair, making it a fun film in the genre for those who enjoy a good story..

B0015DROBO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, although I liked the movie better.  The development of the characters was terrific, but could have been handled with less backstory. At points it was excrutiating.  And the detail on the industrialist's family's past was more than we needed.  Still, these are minor points in an excellent tale, told well.  I wish Larsson was still around to write more.

1423101502|4.0|We had read the first four books in the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series, so we figured that we might as well finish them off.  In this final installment, Perseus (Percy) Jackson, a son of the Greek god Poseidon by a human mother, and his friends, including Grover Underwood the satyr, Annabeth Chase, a daughter of Athena, and Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a human who can see through \\"the mist,\\" must fight Kronos the Titan, who is using the body of Luke Castellan, a former friend and son of Hermes, in his attempt to destroy the gods of Mt. Olympus, which is located above the Empire State Building.  The monster Typhon, is rampaging across the country and occupying the other gods, so Percy and his crew must protect Olympus from Kronos and his army, which includes some of their former friends from Camp Half-Blood who have defected.<br />  Percy, who was twelve when the series began, is now about to turn sixteen, and there is a long-awaited prophecy about his fate which relates to his birthday.  There is no doubt that the book is exciting reading and will hold the interest of today's average middle school and early teenage reader, but with all the modern pop culture references I'm not sure that it will stand the test of time.  As to language, there are a few common euphemisms, references where someone is simply said to have \\"cursed\\" (\\"in Latin\\" or \\"Greek,\\" no less), and a childish slang term for the rear end.  Worse yet, the ubiquitous and disgusting OMG has been transmuted into \\"Oh my gods,\\" which is used rather frequently and is about as close to taking the Lord's name in vain as possible without actually doing it.<br />  Another problem is the troubling practice of the gods in cavalierly having relationships out of wedlock with mortals and producing children.  When Percy goes to see his father, Poseidon's god-wife Amphitrite seems annoyed, and Percy concludes, \\"All his romances with mortals, including with my mom...well, Amphitrite probably didn't like that much.\\"  Yes, I know that things like these were common in the old Greek myths, but they are precisely why many Christians feel that the myths are really not something that godly children ought to be reading about, studying, and finding entertainment in, at least in their unexpurgated form.  It is a mixed bag, with some things to like and some not to like, but overall it is not too bad, though I would suggest it for older readers, say sixteen and above, rather than the target audience.  Riordan has begun a couple of new series, \\"The Heroes of Olympus,\\" which continues the saga of the half-bloods, and \\"The Kane Chronicles,\\" which seems to be based on Egyptian mythology.Yes, I know that things like these were common in the old Greek myths, but they are precisely why many Christians feel that the myths are really not something that godly children ought to be reading about, studying, and finding entertainment in, at least in their unexpurgated form.

B004R13U6Y|4.0|I really like this app, my only beef is that when in landscape mode it will not let me zoom out to fit whole pdf on screen, only to width.  Also when landscape I cant swipe left or right to change pages.  If anyone know how to do this that would be great.  But other than that, I love text to speech and all of the other options.  This will be replacing Adobe Reader for sure!

B004FWPK8G|4.0|I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much, if I weren't in the military. It's funniest in the first half, during her basic phase, and becomes more of a drama in the second half. It's valuable to see a woman standing up for herself and realizing she doesn't need a man in her life to give her purpose.
