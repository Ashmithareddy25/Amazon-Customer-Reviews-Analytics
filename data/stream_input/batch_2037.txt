B009VSW15Y|3.0|It's ok but glad it was free. Pictures are a little pixel-lie. Not sure how much I will really use it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game if you are a horse lover. easy to play and quality graphics. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.
B0083Z614S|4.0|It was nice to be able to read the classics like this from my kindle fire. It is wonderful that it is available on e-print.

B008MF3OEY|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo4US5M5XC9DUY]]This case, the VERSO PROLOGUE (MARBLED BLUE),  is so pretty, I'm going to use it for my Kindle Keyboard even though it doesn't fit quite as well as the case I've been using (the [[ASIN:B003DZ165W Kindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] ).  Because the Verso cover is designed to fit a number of e-readers, and the Kindle Keyboard is the thinnest, the cover's \\"book spine\\" is a little wider than I'd like.  But the spine itself is fun, showing a gold-stamped book title,\\"Verso II\\".<br /><br />I tried this case with all of my small e-readers:  the 1st Gen Kindle Fire, the Kindle Keyboard, and the Nexus 7.  As you can see from the accompanying video slide show, the case works (or as the manufacturer would say, \\"is compatible with\\") all three.  However, depending on the device, you may have to adjust the elastic bands so that they don't cover important keys or buttons.<br /><br />The best fit is with the 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  The device's power button and ports are at the center bottom, and the ambient light sensor is at the upper left corner, so the case's elastic bands interfere with nothing. The Kindle Keyboard is a good fit.  The case's elastic bands come close to covering the outside keyboard keys at the lower left and right, but the bands can be pushed back for clearance; and the bands don't interfere with the Keyboard's power button on the lower edge. The Nexus 7 (which is slightly larger than the Fire, and slightly thicker than the Keyboard) is a snug fit, but the case still works.  The elastic band at the top right must be pushed back to clear the Nexus 7 power and volume buttons located on the side  edge at the top right.  Although the case covers the Nexus 7 speaker on the back, the sound is the same whether the tablet is in or out of the case.<br /><br />Once adjusted, the elastic bands stay in place, because there is a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it. (I have screen protector film on my Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, which seems like a good idea whenever a case holds the e-reader by elastic bands instead of a hard plastic shell.)  This Verso case lacks any elastic closure, magnetic closure, or automatic wake/sleep feature.  However, the case stays closed fairly well (like a book), and offers good protection if your device is placed carefully (not tossed) into a bag or tote.  There is a pocket on the inside cover that is supposedly for \\"important papers\\", but it only holds a few thin items.  Apparently you can use this pocket to hold your e-reader when the cover is folded back.<br /><br />According to the retail literature that comes with it, the Verso Prologue Marbled Blue case is \\"compatible\\" with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0), NOOK, Kobo Wi-Fi, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, BlackBerry Playbook, HTC Flyer, Dell Streak 7, and other 7\\" tablets (e.g., the Nexus 7).  This case is extremely well made, using superior materials, and makes your e-reader look like a beautiful handmade book.protector film on my Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, which seems like a good idea whenever a case holds the e-reader by elastic bands instead of a hard plastic shell.)

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It's a lot about computers, which most everyone these days knows more about than I do, but it's written in a way that even the non-hackers can keep up with.  Clancy's stories always keep  moving at a rapid pace, the adventure is always attention getting, but a little daunting when comparing it to real life.
B008EKOO46|5.0|Doesn't disappoint.  Informative, not tendentious.  Unlike &#34;Guns, Germs and Steel&#34; and &#34;Collapse,&#34; this book doesn't break ground.  No large hypothesis or explanations, but plenty of interesting data.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Boring Book - When you have finished the book which was a real chore, you feel like the human race has sunk into some kind of dark hole.  Every character is weak, lazy, selfish etc.  The back and forth dialog was very repetitive and rather childish.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best! my daughter luvs it! great job natural motion games! if you want a really fun game then this game is perfect!
B004TTHLBE|5.0|You should buy this and read it at least twice.  If you are fortunate, you will dream of drinking mushroom tea with marilyn monroe and joseph campbel at a truck stop casino just off I 10  Mississippi east bound.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is great; works ok no laging or problems some say no return button but works fine by me graphics are clearer and better if you liked TEMPLE RUN ONE  you going to LOVE TEMPLE RUN 2
B00AREIAI8|5.0|aren't the horses so cute? I luv it sooooooo much- but 4 stars because the stuff should be cheaper. but still- get it!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|The icons are cryptic and I get no action st all from some of them.  Have no idea what they do.  Also there does not seem to be one that Reads Aloud as I thought the program would.  My music plays on my Kindle Fire so I know it's not my Kindle's Problem.<br /><br />How about a HELP section to give us some idea of what the app is supposed to do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is very beautifully written. I'm sure many men and women can relate to parts of it. The ending was way too abrupt. Hopefully the author writes a sequel so the story ends the way it should.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|21 Jump Street is hilarious and amusing no matter how many times you've watched it. I love having the ultraviolet digital copy with the dvd, so I can watch it anywhere there is wifi when I'm not home. I've probably watched this movie over 20 times, yet it rarely gets old. My family also loves the movie, though I would not recommend it for young kids.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that temple run is really really really really really really really really awesome its the best best ever
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I have tried a few of the others, problem was that they used too much power themselves trying to get the job done. Others had icons so ugly that I couldn't stand looking at them. This one uses little power, and the icon is attractive and informative. Just what I needed.
B009GX6600|5.0|i HAVE EVERY SEASON OF THE NCIS PROGRAM AND CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE FINAL EPISODE TO ORDER SEASON 10.  I AM HOPING FOR SEVERAL MORE SEASONS TO COM.
B002OSY2T6|2.0|I bought this toy thinking that somehow it moved by press of a button by the baby. However, that is not the case. Admittedly, I should have read the fine print because nowhere does it claim to move automatically. However that is definitely the impression one gets.<br /><br />Looks like some babies enjoy this toy, but ours is indifferent. You have to physically push the toy around; which it does not do well on carpet. The need to push it to move kind of defeats the purpose of encouraging the baby to move. Might as well just get a ball.<br /><br />Also, it is very sensitive in terms of playing music. Even a sneeze in neighboring room can set the music off, so you have to make sure to turn it off when the baby is sleeping.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|found this title on amazon during a sale so couldn't resist getting it.  The Lorax deviates significantly from the book, and a good thing too.  It is more interesting and of course carries a great message.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved playing it at first, but then it turned out to be a rip off. I now can't access the game, and I tried to re-install it, but I can't even do that. If I could play the game, I would rate it higher.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Had this item for a few weeks now and I like it.  Noticeably faster with this connector than the usb one, even without gigabit ethernet.  Haven't noticed the thunderbolt port getting loose (I probably plugged it in and removed it twice a day since I got it).  Definitely a keeper.  Packaging was minimal and curiously it included an instruction sheet.  Definitely a good buy.
B000RHKARO|5.0|Excellent album.  I have had the LP (vinyl) album since this recording came out in the late 60's/early 70's.  My album is worn out but now I have the CD!
B00486070K|4.0|Wanted to give it 5 stars, but the speed just wasn't perfect.  I understand the limitations of a USB 2 connection, but when connected to a router without gigabit internet, the thunderbolt connector seemed significantly faster.  Still use this product, but not my first choice
B0070Y46UY|5.0|IF YOU LIKE TO READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU SEE  THE MOVIE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  LEARNED ALOT ABOUT ZOO KEEPING AND  ANIMALS TERRITORY  BOOK ALWAYS HAS MORE INFOMATION  GOOD READ
B004AM5QT4|3.0|I'm not enjoying this book as much as prior Ken Follett novels. Maybe Kindle had a problem converting it, but I notice there are a lot of misspellings in this book. That just irritates me.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is a lot like fifty shades of Grey. It's almost too alike except for the bondage and whips.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I was pleased to find this continuing saga. I enjoyed Cathedral very much and this book is just as captivating.
B007SGM084|5.0|13 Chapters in and cannot put the 1st book down yet.  So no further comment...so far I recommend this trilogy!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't wait for the third book in the trilogy to be published. I love to read long novels that delve deeply into the character's lives. I will be very happy to continue my relationship with these people for one more book!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, Defending Jacob.  It held my interest from page one and I could not figure out the &#34;who done it&#34; aspect until the end.........which I am still pondering in my mind.
B001E45XT4|3.0|The sound on this headsets are pretty good. I have been using them for 3 years, I bought them for less than 30$ but unfortunately they broke, first the Mic, now its the earpiece.<br /><br />They did great for 3 years of hard using and falls from my desk.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Just stop looking at reviews and read this book, otherwise you're wasting your time!  Wonderful and believable take on the events!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I bought the book in part because the book description compared the effort to the works of Neal Stephenson and Umberto Eco. When those names are dropped, I think of complexity, philosophical profundity, long narratives fed by informative tributaries and writing that stuns me with it's ability to illuminate. Saying that Mr. Penumbra stands with these geniuses works is like comparing your local park to a rain-forest because they both have trees. It has some elements of the greater works, like the hidden code stuff and the secret society stuff, but again, more Disney than profound. Penumbra is fun, lighthearted, maybe a little Dan Brownish without the darkness rather than Eco-ish. Pleasant reading, good effort, nice filler, - not serious literature.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This album helped me survive a trying time in my life this past summer. Their songs don't really fit with my current life perspectives, but I love them anyway.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Excellent product for fast clean ups. Main thing, do not over charge and be gentle with it and it can be your best friend. I had one to last 5 years. I would have lasted longer but I left it on the charger for a couple of days. Set a reminder on your phone or I use my stove timer if I'm gonna be home.<br />I love mine !!!
B007MU85D0|4.0|I love their music, the lyrics, and their voices, but when I listen to this album it puts me in a very somber mood, which isn't a bad thing if that's the mood I'm in or want to be in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun and Really addicting. It seems very realistic and I'm amazed at the many choices you have. I agree the gems are time consuming but well worth it. Makes me want a real horse :) Love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's really fun. so much better than the first. there are many more obstacles to go through. it's a really great game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Seems like a cross of the original Temple Run with a bit of Brave. Liking the game so far. Can't complain.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it helps keep me connected to interest when I' m not able to get to my computer for a long time. I've also learned some really great recipes.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a Great Book! I Loved it! It was hard to put down. I am soo excited for the movie.
B009X01C64|4.0|Quality material; great function.<br />To be &#34;Superior&#34;, add band to hold stylus & redesign so Kindle can be recharged with case closed.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book!!<br /><br />  It was beautifully written and I felt as though I knew them<br /><br />I felt Eliza' s longing for love
0812982622|5.0|I'm not one for Amazon product reviews of any kind, but I feel compelled to chime in here. In this novel, Adam Johnson has imagined a world that no other novelist -- or creator of any kind of fiction, really -- has bothered to imagine. And, in retrospect, it seems ridiculous that no one had tried. North Korea is the world's one true dystopia, and therefore germane ground for an ambitious storyteller. Johnson is more than up to the task: in plain language, he creates characters and settings that instantly sear themselves into your memory; without moralizing, he offers nuanced revelations about humankind's capacity for brutality and deception. You certainly don't have to be a Koreaphile to find the book fascinating, but if you are one (as I am), you'll have an extra kick of excitement to see an American author treat the tragedies of the Korean Peninsula with such empathy and intelligence.<br /><br />This is a novel that is part societal dissection, part fairytale, part bildungsroman, part love story, and part postmodern experiment. It's unlike anything you'll ever read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing!!<br />Great way to finish off the series.. mad the service was great!!<br />Easily giving it a 5 star!!
B008966SLM|5.0|One of his best !  Great songwriting, singing, guitar leads, piano work, good mix of songs, with a live one at the end!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I know lots of people have complained that Clancy isn't writing much of these anymore and they're not as good, but I still thought it was a fun read and kept my interest. I liked it.
1895565375|1.0|I feel that the message this book intends to convey will be misunderstood by young children, especially if they see the illustrations.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|For the price i got this at who wouldnt want to order it and i love this show so much cant wait to have them all!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this app is pretty.  I'm getting pissed that every time I get to a certain point it resents on me though

B00AVPYT8I|1.0|I should have read the reviews before downloading this app. Click, click, click and most of the time shows blank screen for results, then keeps taking me back to beginning where have to start over. Frustrating!!!!!
B0000024T3|5.0|Was so glad to find this on a cd. Had on vinyl. This was a young Barbra at her purist and the transition to CD works really well. Good sound quality. Quite pleased.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I really hated the email app that came with the Kindle Fire. It just quit working for me for some reason so I went out looking for an alternative. I tried several and didn't like them. Then I came across this app. I thought &quot;why not?&quot;. So I downloaded it and, of course, it took some time to figure it out. But now that I have all my accounts set up and everything the way I want I just LOVE it!!!! This is absolutely the IT app to get if you are looking for an alternative to the standard email app included with the Kindle Fire! 4/5 simply because there is room for some minor improvements.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Excellent buy. I'm glad I bought the whole album. I was originally only going to buy \\"Same Love\\" then I heard \\"Thrift Shop\\", and \\"Wing$\\", and \\"Can't Hold Us\\".  Glad to support the artists.
B005JIV0NE|5.0|This  is  so  cool.  Works great even in small  area.  We had no problems . Our family loves  the kinect.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is really the best game I can sit here for hrs and stare at my horse best game in the entire world
B005U9QJY2|5.0|One of my favorite fantasy films of all time and the first of its kind... Where there were no humas at all in the entire film. The sets are stunning, the characters are fantastic and the story is magical. This is a part of my youth that I still love today and have passed down to my daughter. Jim Henson was such a beautiful thinker and pioneer and Brian Frouds designs are out this world stellar. There's a real message in this movie, I saw it as a child, but I wouldn't call it a kid's movie.
B008NABUU8|4.0|this mind challenging. I like I like. I like. better graphics would help I am sure it will get better in time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pretty fun, there's a lot to do and the horses look really realistic. Easy to earn gems and money. I'll keep this for awhile.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|for a cheap price and hours of fun. worth the three dollars that I paid. looking forward to the sequel.
B000IZA9OE|5.0|One of my best movie ever i ever sow .. I just bay it again to from amazon to store it in my movie library
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game wouldn't download in order to get it I had to delete 5 apps but whenever. Would try to play it I would have to download it AGAIN.In conclusion that is why temple run 2 is okay.
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|Twisted and unique! Dark comedy at its best!  I'll never view a chicken leg in the same light....worth watching, indeed!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great writing. Keeps you wanting more. I really like her books. Creative and suspenseful. This would be great for book club.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Been looking forward to Darius Rucker's newest release, was disappointed when it was announced that it won't be released until a  later date, i don't know the reasons why but please do release this album. Darius is a fine performer and look forward to all his future country releases.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Had to wait till I got a working player to play these,  my computer wasn't cooperating.  Wanted this whole series for a long time.  Have not got through all of the dvds but so far they work great.  I like the box that it comes in with the individual seasons.  Happy, Happy.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Watch this movie right now! One of the best comedies of the year. Really, Really enjoyed it. Thank you very much.
B00B3Q86LK|5.0|Why would anyone pay $2.99 per episode when you can watch it in HD on PBS.org for free? Love the show. Stupid pricing on Amazon's part.

B004TI5N38|4.0|Enjoyed this book,a little cheesy in some parts but all action BOOKS and movies are. I will likely read other books with this character
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose this rating because once again Jeff Kinney has impressed me!it had a great theme and the pictures add a fun taste to the book. Pure genius
B002PZC8BM|5.0|The Mentalist reminds me a lot of Peter Falk's Columbo. It is full of surprises. The whole cast is very believable.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This little app is wonderful if you are an Evernote user. It instantly syncs with your trunk and gives you immediate access to your notes. They layout is just a bit different that your laptop/desktop, but is intuitive and easy to get around. I love being able to access my files with my Kindle tablet!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book, it was amusing and heartwarming. Two people who do not truly belief in love, settle for a convenient marriage that slowly comes to mean much more than either expected.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game just the title caught my eye the picture just made it seem mysterious but I have to say the game is more fun than it seems. I was hooked the second I started playing, I had an adrenaline rush when I first the freaky creature. This game is great play it and have fun make your brain work a little.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you like historical fiction, you'll really enjoy this read.  It's perfect for my kindle. I plan to read all three in the trilogy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Good  application, I can read my books any time,  any place, mi favorites books. And have thousands spanish books. Realy I love it.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|I heard a lot of great things about this book, and I really wanted to like it. While the idea had potential, it failed to deliever. First of all, I think using cassette tapes was very outdated. Maybe if it was set 30 years ago, but I kept wondering why she didn't just use an e-mail.<br /><br />The main purpose of a book is for the reader to feel for the characters and actually care about them, but I couldn't relate to Hannah or Clay at all. I don't mean to sound rude or heartless. After all I didn't have the easiest time in high school. But I didn't really think Hannah's reasons for suicide were really enough. I know most people can't even begin to imagine what brings a person to kill themselves, but I was expecting more. After all, a lot of girls get a bad reputation and never resort to suicide. Plus, It's not like Hannah had abusive parents. Truthfully, I thought her character was a little whiny.<br /><br />As for Clay, I was expecting a big revelation about him, which is one reason why I stuck through it for so long. Clay's tape is a big dissapointment. It's like the author came up with the whole story, but forgot to put Clay in there, so he just made something up on the spot.<br /><br />I'm not saying this book was terrible. It does have a good message, but it's not something I would recommend or rave about.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I know app was probably meant for younger kids, but I'm sixteen years old and I find it very entertaining. I loved horses since I was two years old and this is as good way to own as horse without all the actual mess. The only mess you get is virtual. I think this is a good app for people of all ages.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing!! The controls are simple and intuitive as well as easy to grasp. A small child could easily be able to play this game. I love the whole concept, and I could play it for hours on end! The only issue that I have is that sometimes the tilt controls stop working, so my dude just stays in the middle. This problem is easily solved by restarting my Kindle, so it's not really an issue. Temple Run is great for killing a bit of time in the doctor's office or wherever and is fantastic just to have some fun!<br /><br />I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its fun to play and seems like you're actually at a farm and have a horse that you're training. I wish this was real but unfortunately it isn't. lol
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm in the process of playing this, and I LOVE it!! The graphics are way better than Temple Run, and there are many more environments and creative elements in the this game. The one thing that I'm not a huge fan of is that the upgrades aren't as easy to understand as in the original, but I got a hang of them.<br /><br />This game is as addicting and fun as the original, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Temple Run.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|grandkids recommended it, found it to be good entertainment, fun, and it's free. some levels are a little fustrating but if fills the time.
B004O2AZHI|3.0|If I would have had a more detailed discription I wouldn't have bought it. I'm really happy with the price of the movie, can't find a better deal for this great movie. Guess ill have to invest in a region blu-ray player.
1603429999|5.0|This book is extremely well written, particularly for someone who is relatively new to knitting.  The author clarifies a lot of the techniques that other books assume you already know.  Would definitely recommend.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book but you have to read the first one to understand the second. I like the use of all the characters but the characters were a little predictable in their actions. I can't believe the ending to this book,that was unpredictable.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Better than the first book in the series. More dynamic storyline. Sex scenes are overrated. I hope the third book is better.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I'm an avid reader but have never felt compelled to write a review for a book - until now.  Because this book was that bad.<br /><br />Since the story begins as a budding teen romance - I thought I had inadvertently purchased a YA book.  When I confirmed it was not, I had to put this in the context of remembering what it felt like for myself at that age, rather than what it was like for my own kids at that age, in order to carry on.  Otherwise, it's awkward for someone who is way beyond the teen years.  Based on the description (piqued my interest) and high review rating, I plowed ahead, which was possible because it's a very simple read in one day book.  The writing is not stellar, there are a lot of issues - but it's tolerable.  It's a shame the author doesn't use her talent to create a quick-read book for something better than this mess.<br /><br />The only reason I kept reading to the end is because there is a good story buried in here somewhere.  As it became clear there was much more to the story than the romance, I was curious where the author was going with it.  Unfortunately, it all morphs into a confusing jumble of teen romance and heavy, emotional traumatic subject matter.  Without giving it away, the juxtaposition between the hot and heavy romance between Sky and Holder and what I will call the Other Story is too much.  It's just head-shaking to me that any author could craft a story that is clearly geared toward teen girls and their raging hormones and then bring in the level of real-life emotional trauma that comes with not one but no less than 3 major mess-with-your mind events that happen to the protagonists.  The \\"solution\\" is they will figure it out and get through it, as long as they are together, in each other's arms (and then some), holding each other's pinkies, gazing at the stars.  Romantic fantasy is one thing.  But romantic fantasy that introduces very real-life subject matter while completely ignoring the clear need for psychological intervention in order to heal properly is unconscionable.  Romance will not make that kind of hurt go away.  What remains of this story after most of it escapes through the gaping holes in the plot (including the idea that any teen by the age of 17 doesn't know anything about texting or Netflix) is a confused mess that suffers from an identity crisis on several levels.ention in order to heal properly is unconscionable.

B0092YRYBS|5.0|And I went to grab just the one ...but I had to play another which led to another and then I just gave in and bought the album...goes with anything and is well done. Fits my 'Indie/gazer/Alt' playlist nicely; along w/ the 6,500 other songs! Day or night, driving or sitting, walking or hanging around the pool...a pleasure to hear them!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so hooked on this series and now that I am caught up on the episodes, I'm missing the characters and storylines so much. I can't wait for the next episodes so I can see what happens next. This is so well-written and well-acted. The costumes and period details, even the social issues and timely news, is just so rich and compelling. More, please!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I thought Denzel nailed it again with a perfect performance as an airline pilot dealing with alcoholism. I wonder how many times this goes on currently in real life? Hopefully Airlines will conduct random and periodic blood tests on their pilots.<br /><br />I love to watch movies with Denzel Washington because he makes you feel the emotions of the character, as with this character, Whip Whitaker. Also noted, Flight had an all star cast with Don Cheadle and John Goodman.<br /><br />The character of Whip Whitaker, takes on what should be just another every day domestic flight. The weather condition was bad and Whip had not slept the night before with alcohol and cocaine fresh in his system. Almost at their destination, and after battling strong weather and turbulence, the plane begins to malfunction. Whip takes control and does what no other pilot can do to try and save lives.<br /><br />What happens next throughout the story is Whip Whitaker battles within him self the aftermath and the uncertainty of his future. He's looking for comfort in all the wrong places and needs to come to terms with why his life is where it currently is. His family and friends have all given up on him, but will he give up on himself? You should watch the movie to find out.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not for anyone under 18 but for the younger generation still. Kept me guessing. Deals with very emotional and disturbing situations. All in all I wanted to keep reading which to me means its a good book.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I have liked all 3 of the series. This one had a lot of rehash of information. Overall a good read. Do not have to have read the other two, but as with any series, it helps tie the story together.
1452101426|5.0|Wonderful for the art & Disney lover!  I purchased this as a gift for my sister, but had already seen it in person at Disneyland; so I knew it was a high quality book filled with numerous concept illustrations from the many artists and animators that worked on the film.  Great gift!

0307887960|3.0|This diet works, and without hunger. Having said that, you wind up eating an extremely low amount of calories. I wound up passing out after only 2 weeks on the diet. The good news is I lost lots of weight in time for my wedding! I wouldn't do it again, but it was much more pleasant than atkins (atkins made me feel greasy, constipated and ill all the time).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would buy it but I have parental controls. My dad told me but my kindle is stupid. I know he knows it because I asked him right after he set it....Stupid kindle.

B00B5Q8KYQ|5.0|I love Suits!  I wish Mike would go to night school and get his real law degree - I get nervous that someone is going to find out and he is going to jail or get into all kinds of trouble.  The Firm should help him make his standing legal somehow so he would be free to actually become a really great lawyer!  His mind is amazing and the chemistry between Mike and Harvey is terrific.  I think Harvey can be a prick at times though!  lol  I am on edge about what will happen once it comes out about Mike and what will happen......ugh.

B00000425L|5.0|For me, Ashkenazy's Preludes are perfection. I can't imagine better than this beautiful, highly nuanced performance that captures all their shifting suggestiveness. Ashkenazy's golden tone can die to the softest ppppp, yet is still penetrating and touches you at your core.
0811879542|5.0|Based on the good reviews this receives, I got this for my girls for Christmas. They really love it, and so do we. Fun & interactive!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoy hidden object and puzzle games. G5 always delivers. Awesome graphics, good storyline, nice variety of puzzles,decent pace, and a choice of difficulty levels. Just got the full version and am anxious to get back to it :-) . Keep them coming :-) :-) :-) .
B005NPCJ88|5.0|love this band. was not a bad price for this album. listen to it all the time. any fans of fivefinger death punch should buy this!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow......to sum up the book, it was heart warming, heart wrenching, heart breaking and heart warming altogether! It is not your typical romance novel, that takes you for a ride with its ups and downs. You fall in love with Sky and Holder and cannot put the book down once you have started. A must read!
B009POCG0Y|4.0|This is a dark and violent movie that is highlighted with excellent acting from some of the characters.  Chris Smith (Emile Hirsh) is in real trouble as his drug stash was stolen by his mom and she sold it.  He has to pay up $6,000 now or get killed by the drug dealers and loan sharks.  He contrives a plan to have his mom killed by a local cop named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who does murder for hire on the side.  The goal is to collect the life insurance money and pay Killer Joe and the drug dealers and split up the rest with his redneck family....<br /><br />This is a complex plot that has several twists and turns in it.  The movie is violent and sexual and may offend some viewers.  The acting by Emile Hirsh and Matthew McConaughey was excellent.  Matthew plays a really scary killer who is cold blooded and ruthless while Emile plays a down on his luck redneck that is almost clueless to how much trouble he is in.<br /><br />This is one of those films that if you can put the violence and other tasteless acts that are in the film out of the way you can enjoy a reasonable story with some great acting.  It is rated NC 17 and it contains bloody violence and sexual content so be aware of what you are viewing.  If that is not your style you may want to pass on this one.  I gave it 4 stars primarily based on the acting.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I really loved this book, it was very interesting and so similar to the movie hope you enjoy this book :)
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Incredibly suspenseful<br />Have read all of her books And craving more! Gillian Flynn reminds me of tana French but better
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an AWESOME, CLEAN, engaging TV series! A VERY hard find these days!  Can't wait to connect with my Mom and sisters to discuss the latest episode!
140123769X|5.0|One of the darkest and grimmest Fables yet. I can't really say much more without giving spoilers, but parents beware of this issue. This shows how good of a writer Bill Willingham is though. I thought it was some of the best Fables writing in a while.  I should mention that this does not include the Oz tales as it says in the ads. Instead, you get the two-part arc of The Destiny Game.  If you're a fan of Fables this will not disappoint you. It brings back the hard-hitting tales the comic use to have. And this one hits you hard.
0955153077|5.0|Great book to launch into painting with Photoshop. It comes in a printed clear plastic sheath  which protects it. Great quality book. I will be studying this one for a while.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I haven't even played this yet and I am already having problems with this game!! It takes too long to download it has been downloading for over 24 hours and still isn't downloaded yet!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This site is great fun, have it on my phone, only problem is it will not always save completed games. Maybe it is the way it is set up, but really frustrating at times, still addicted to it so oh well.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was plain vanilla.  First person narration did not provide for well developed characters, nor did it allow the reader to experience some of the plot twists that would have been possible if allowed.  It was a quick read due to the fact that some areas were so predictable as to be skimmed without loss.  It was OK.  Deck reading or pre-nap relaxtion.  I am not saying don't read, but don't pay full price for sure.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Beautiful ending! A bit of John Irving-esque. All things came around nicely. The characters had great backstories, and stayed true to themselves. Lovely!!
B005LN5UOC|5.0|This gio-tech came in the box ready to game, it was very easy to set up. Syncing it to my ps3 with out any trouble. This headset is very sturdy and feels well made, i've had expensive headsets before so i felt that for the price and the fact that this item has very little reviews i was taking a gamble. Boy am i glad i took that gamble, the sound is great and it is extremely comfortable. i highly recommend i am very happy with my purchase!!!! :)

1400052181|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It tells the story of a young, poor, black woman, Henrietta Lacks,  who died of cancer in the 1950s. Scientists at the time were trying to grow lines of cells that could easily be grown and sold for use in research.  Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells were magical cells that reproduced indefinitely.  They were so easy to grow that they were used in most of the major medical breakthroughs in the second half of the 20th century.  Yet Henrietta Lacks remained virtually unknown and her family received no compensation.<br /><br /> The author does a terrific job of combining science, history, ethics, biography, and her own personal experiences.  It's a story about people as much as science.  I especially liked the fact that she didn't turn it into a good guys vs. bad guys story.  There are many instances of injustices, but there are also many people who tried to do right by Henrietta Lacks and her family.  The author also discusses the ethics of medical testing and who owns the tissues that doctors remove from your body during medical procedures.  (Not you, apparently.)<br /><br />The author contacted Henrietta Lacks' children and cousins as part of her research.  She took some of them along with her on her journey to discover the truth.  The Lacks family is as poor and uneducated as can be, while the author was a young, white, well-educated woman.  It was not an easy journey for any of them.  Sometimes the family members trusted her and were willing to work with her.  Other times they wanted nothing to do with her.  The author relates her experiences with a tremendous amount of sympathy for the family.  Their mother's cells made a lot of people wealthy and were instrumental in some of the most important medical discoveries of our time, yet the Lacks family can't afford basic medical care.<br /><br />It's a fascinating story, told with a great deal of empathy for all involved.  I highly recommend it.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Excellent moving movie on a beautiful chunk of America's frontiers' past. Lovely cast! Dr Quinn is a must-see & must-have! Good product for the buck!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The big issue facing the town council in the small town of Pagford is what to do about the Fields - a low income public housing development - and the drug addiction clinic that serves many of the Fields' residents.  When council member Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies, several residents decide to run for his seat so they can advocate for or agaist the Fields.  This leads to a series of events where family secrets are revealed and tragedies unfold.<br /><br />First, the good news.  J.K Rowling has an amazing way of bringing characters to life.  This is one of those novels that's more about the characters than the plot. Her descriptions of the angst, the insecurities, the bullying, the helplessness in the face of abusive parents, and the thought processes of teens is spot on. Her description of a school counselor reminded me of many teachers I've known.  The description of the busybody wife of a local council member rang so true.<br /><br />Now the bad news.  This book is grim, unrelentingly grim.  Almost every character (and there are many) is unhappy and deeply flawed.  Fathers are mentally and physically abusive to their children.  Husbands cheat on their wives.  Employees steal from their bosses.  Teens bully other teens.  Mothers are drug addicts and prostitutes.  Marriages are unhappy. Teens take revenge on their parents.  There's rape.  There's death.  It goes on and on.<br /><br />Throughout the first half of the book I kept asking myself why I was reading this.  It was all so depressing  Then one of the characters set something in motion that made me want to keep reading.  The second half moved along at a faster clip than the first half.  But there was never a happy ending in sight.  There was never a good guy to root for.  I was always waiting for the next tragedy to unfold.  Not until the very end of the book was there even a glimmer of hope for any of the characters.<br /><br />I'm sure the author must have had some point she was trying to make, some statement about British society that we're supposed to take away from this book.  But whatever it was, I didn't understand it.  All I came away with was a tremendous sense of relief that I was done with the book.  It was just too depressing for me.
0307744434|4.0|Le Cirque des Rêves (The Circus of Dreams), as imagined by Erin Morgenstern in The Night Circus is both real and imaginary at once, an illusion that tempts all the senses and mesmerizes its patrons (and readers) with a seemingly endless array of curiosities and spectacles.  It is a circus unlike any other.  It appears and disappears in the night, and is only open from dusk to dawn.  Everything in it, down to the dirt on the ground, is rendered in shades of black and white.  Its marvels include contortionists and mazes and blooming gardens of ice. But Le Cirque des Rêves is not just a circus; it is a battleground.  The story opens with two aged magicians each choosing a child as a champion, each of them to be set against each other in some mysterious `challenge'.  Le Cirque des Rêves is the arena.<br /><br />Like the circus Morgenstern describes, her novel is an astonishing feat of magic.  If J.K. Rowling and Steven King (both influences cited by Morgenstern) collaborated on a novel, the result might feel like this.  Immediately reminiscent of Harry Potter, with young sorcerers as protagonists, it quickly morphs into something completely original.  It is both dark and light, as is the concept of a circus that shines in the night, but there is no childish demarcation of good or bad here.  Those lines are blurred, and the reader is immersed in the grayness of the in-between.  Morgenstern's vision is more subtle than good and evil, she aims instead to pit passion against apathy, idealism against calculated effort for personal gain, and, of course, love against anything that might stand in its way.<br /><br />The Night Circus is so deep and gorgeous - so wildly imaginative - it took my breath away.  The fantastic details that Morgenstern uses to paint this very vivid and strange world are like tiny jewels on a Fabergé egg - a perfect world in miniature.  Morgenstern seems to know instinctively how to use words to create the very atmosphere within which the circus andits characters live. The scenes and language Morgenstern uses to paint them are evocative of dark streets and pools of lamplight and slithering things just out of sight.  The sense of wonder is there, but so, too, is the sense of spectacle, and the sense that just underneath all of the showmanship is a rotting corpse, a stinking thing that we are all afraid to look at.<br /><br />Morgenstern is relatively young, and this is her first novel.  At 34 years old, her writing is hip, edgy, and dark.  The Night Circus is a joy to read, and would be appropriate for young adults, as well as the rest of us, although the darkness that simmers below the surface might be lost on the youngest reader.  Fall under the spell of The Night Circus - it's worth the price of admission.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie was generally a good watch. It was entertaining and held my attention throughout. I had no idea what the movie was about before I watched it. I enjoyed the alternate universe that the movie was based in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great! Ty loves it! Highly reccomended game. Educational and family orientated. Keeps everyone on their toes snd thinking. Never gets boreing!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I read this book because many people had recommended it to me. Reading the book was interesting to find out how Apple was created and how several of the Tech companies were intertwined. I work in tech myself and learning some of the things that worked for Steve Jobs and some of the things that didn't work was thought provoking. It was also surprising to read about what kind of person he was and how I don't think I would enjoy working for him... at all.
0439023521|4.0|Not brilliant writing but good as CD/audio if only to hear the two words \\"Effie Trinket.\\"<br />Love it. Dickens couldn't have come up with a better character name.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had to read this right away. Again I couldn't put it down. You can connect with the characters so easily.
1401234550|5.0|This trade collects issues #1-6 of the New 52 Green Lantern title (2011).<br /><br />DC's New 52 reboot is a very divisive topic, even for individual readers.  One one hand a lot of interesting things and title got cut short so DC could wipe the slate clean, and since they didn't even entirely do that (elements of the previous continuity have been retained in pieces or whole on a widely inconsistent basis) some of the new material has been very inaccessible and confusing.  On the other hand a lot of creative teams have made the most of the opportunity this major shake-up provided and have produced some truly excellent comics.<br /><br />Green Lantern is one I wasn't sure I was going to bother with.  I find Geoff Johns very hit or miss as a writer, and his Hal Jordan annoys me as often as he entertains me.  Also, before the reboot the Green Lantern mythos was very dense - the stories I had tried here and there definitely didn't resonate with me particularly well largely due to the fact that I wasn't reading every GL title and every major DC crossover event.  THe GL continuity is one of the ones being carried over into the New 52 in large pieces, which lead me to believe this problem would not be alleviated.<br /><br />But this title has been very well received and I find Sinestro's reinstatement very intriguing so here we are.  And I'm very happy to have been proven wrong about my reservations.  Johns does a wonderful job hitting the high points of past events and giving the reader everything they need to know to follow this title without slowing down the plot.  The unfolding events, which in interweaving ways involve Hal, Carol, Sinestro, the Guardians and the Sinestro Corps, are highly engrossing and left me eager to read more.<br /><br />In theme the book is in large part about both Sinestro's and Hal's flaws and strengths, and having each character self aware of them and having to learn to deal.  It takes the edge off of Hal and makes Sinestro even more fascinating and complex.<br /><br />The art is spot on and perfectly suits both the epic space elements and the quieter normal life moments of the story.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the better New 52 books I have tried.  It stands on it's own nicely, which is refreshing for a Green Lantern book, and sets up some great hooks for future issues.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|this movie delivered as promised.  the appearance of all of the different action heroes totally cracked us up.  chuck norris' entrance - awesome!  and yet it still managed to have some witty banter and enjoyable lines.  great flick for a weekend night!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I purchased this so my grandchildren can color and create.  It keeps them quite busy.  Even my 3 year old grand son has figured it out.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I love fiction & fantasy, and this book didn't seem like anything I've read. It held my attention, and I was fascinated by the photos. I finished it in just a few days.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found it a hard start, but once I got into it, very hard to put down.  Very suspenseful.  Captivating.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. My son loves the music in this movie. The colors and animation are great.
B0067R0APK|4.0|when you open the app the word &quot;sale&quot; remains on the title. bothersome. but a very good app. the ten day
B006LSZECO|1.0|The storyline was interesting and compelling.  However, the language was awful.  I consider any author who has to resort to the constant use of such bad words lacks the vocabulary to be an excellent or even good writer.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson did a fantastic job wrapping up the massive story Robert Jordan left.  Two things to keep in mind about the book are:<br />1. Robert Jordan actually wrote the last chapter word for word.  No edits were done on it.  Everything else was Sanderson trying to get the characters to the last chapter.  Many people have complained about the ending and think Sanderson didn't do a very good job.  Knowing this, I believe Sanderson did a great job getting everyone where they were supposed to be.<br />2. It was Robert Jordan's wife's decision to not release the e-book at the same time as the hard cover.  She wanted to make sure this final Hard Cover book made it to the top of the best seller lists in order to protect Jordan's legacy.  Some lists do not count e-book sales.  It was not about the money as so many people have complained about.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I was looking for a good safe place to put all my account numbers and passwords, and this product is perfect for that.  Very easy to put in the information, and I liked how the information was displayed when accessed.  Good product.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Phenomenal! Rarely do I have the love/hate relationship with a book. There were times I cursed Martin for what he did to some of the characters. I hated what he did to some, but what he did made the book gripping and extremely intense.<br /><br />I know most say the next 2 books are not up nearly to par, but if you made this far there is no turning back.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|very good mi son  is very happy with this item gracias mi hijo lo disfruta mucho cobn sus amiguitos y muy buen precio
B0000CEB4V|2.0|The Audio is terrible, volume changes from high to low during several of the songs.  Not sure if this is a problem with our purchase or an overall problem with the recording.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have purchased Season 1, Season 2 and all of Season 3 so far this year.  This is one of the greatest TV shows that has come along in many years.  It is about a  family and their servants who adapt to the many curves that life throws at them and has a wonderful cast that makes you feel as if you are living their story as part of their family.  I cannot wait for the next episode to download to my Kindle Fire.  As a Prime Member I received the first Season free and pay $1.99 for each additional episode I order.  I cannot wait for the next episode to be available to download to my Kindle.  I even go back and see the previous episodes which I enjoy watching again.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Nice, no ads. Great turtorial. And was free! Easy to play. Just stared playi g so nothing further to add yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When you just want to relax or just want a distraction, this game would be great for that! It's also great for horse lover's to get a sence of how things are done.

0743216385|5.0|The adventures were great. The danger was great. The risk was great. But the reward was even greater. The Band of Brothers movie series follows the book very well. The book does have some more information in it. Highly recommend to anyone who likes reading or liked the tv series. You won't be disappointed.
0307594009|5.0|Excellent and moving. A brave lady and so tragic as to what may have been had she lived. What a terrible loss to literature but a gain for those who need to know about the human spirit. Courage comes in many guises and her courage will pass down the years. Her writings are her legacy.
0756655307|5.0|This books is a nice edition to anyone's comic library. It's big, heavy and filled with graphics of every character from Marvel. I mean honestly, there are way too many. It also gives you the quick bio sheet like who took Thor's hammer over the years or when Red Hulk comes out and things like that.
B0098460O4|2.0|It is a shame that these two talented young singers were not allowed to sound more like themselves on this album. Each track is typically overly instrumental with a heavy layer of production that robs the singers of their best asset; their sound! The end result is a cheesy, cheap sounding album that totally takes away from the singers. Shame, they are pretty good!
B006E4QCXU|2.0|Thought this would be fun for my wife and grand kids. I was wrong. They were bored quickly. I removed it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A love story that kept me entriged through out the book.  Little twists and turns but a nice ending to a good story.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Bought this one for my wife. Great songs and Susan does a great job. Nothing new in the way of songs, so only four stars.
B001O7JHJ8|4.0|Good and lively music.  The CD was purchased primarily for the song &#34;Always&#34; which I really enjoy, but the CD as a whole worth listening to.

B003VS0CWY|5.0|The Sound of Music.  Although an older film, it remains a good and timeless and heart-warming show for the whole family.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I'm a big fan of Philippa Gregory's work, and this did not disappoint. Like her other novels it felt like you we're there in history with them, without it being to dry with historical facts
B00004TS0E|5.0|The DVD Miracle on 34th Street.  An enjoyable movie that is good for the whole family.  Although it is fantasy, still it remains a worthwhile and entertaining film.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Ordered the app on amazon...kept trying to find it on my device...I could not find it...they say I have it...I know I don't...they suck
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Challenging puzzles which lead you through a maze of scenarios ultimately leading to an exciting conclusion. Highly recommended for those who enjoy thought provoking mental challenges
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is listed under &#34;Teens/Young Adults&#34; and though it seems like it is typical teenage angst, it is much more.  The characters are nicely vivid, very enjoyable book.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I love this album! It had been getting a lot of hate and I can't see why?! Battle born is one of their best songs!!!! I recommend this to any killers fan!!!
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Because this is taking place in space, the game is very slow.  I played it a few times and then deleted it from my tablet.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Works well, the kids like it and the price was right.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is the first Angry Birds I played and I was hooked from the beginning.  As a matter of fact, my husband was laughing at me because he had bought me a tablet with a lot of great functions but I was spending most of my time playing this game.  I then got a friend addicted to this game.  Very fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing story. I couldn't put the book down. This book has a mix of love and tragedy.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I happen to love the Angry Birds games.  This game was so much fun with different characters than the original.
B004WR125O|4.0|I purchased this with a new Onkyo receiver because I don't have network cabling throughout the house. I plugged it in and the receiver saw it right away and it connected right up to my wireless network. Sure, $20 plus dollars isn't the cheapest wireless USB adapter on the market, but it was necessary for me to connect my receiver to the network/internet and I wasn't concerned with interop issues.
B007M45PMU|4.0|This is a good album to listen to straight through.  I don't think it's anything revolutionary, but I'd recommend trying this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Every challenge is different. No two are alike. Just don't like how easy it is to use your energy quickly and how long it takes to get it back.  Addicting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it this game is so amazing I haven't played anything like it in years. because I'm really old I'm like in my well that's for me to know and not you
B0000057D8|4.0|While the power and accuracy of modern orchestras may be more appealing to some, it is good to hear this famous piece rendered in original form.
0307472590|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in the last 5 years. You can easily connect with each of the characters in this novel. If you love thrillers and drama, this is it.
0060254920|5.0|I am not sure how I missed this story when I was a child, but this is a great bedtime story. I think as my daughter grows that this story may help put to rest any fears of monsters because the ones in this book aren't all that bad.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|A wonderful and long over due premise, but the book fails to deliver on the title's implied intention.  However, the second half (and the three codas) are much better than the first half of the novel.  If you can recover from the disappointment of the first half, you will find an interesting story with characters that grow on you and are augmented by the included shorts.
B0086700CM|5.0|I Love this game, and I play it at least once a day!!! Sometimes even up to ten times :) Keep up the Good Work! :) :) :)
B000024JEX|5.0|I only bought this Box Set for the I Fall In Love Too Easily/The Fire Within Track, and the rest of the album met that same high standard. Very Moving and the best music I've ever heard.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Kept me turning the page but not hour after hour. More like day after day. I was recommended to read this and glad I did but it could have been more thrilling.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It Was the most amazing book I have ever read. I am going to read all of Rick Riordan's book's
B001IMFHVG|5.0|For anyone who appreciates classical piano. This is a \\"must\\" to listen to. It has the beauty to \\"lift\\" one up.There was no one like Artur Rubinstein.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a well constructed suspense story that keeps you up until you finish it. It is a Vintage Nicholas Sparks story.
B000FC24ZW|5.0|I thought it was a good mystery story. The conclusion was far from what I expected. I would recommend this to others.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci not only writes suspenseful stories but includes small details about everything.  He's a master of the language and a pleasure to read just to see each word coming up on the page, like a lovely lemon drop on one's tongue.  His prose is poetic and lyrical, and his stories are stunning.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book hooked me quickly with strong descriptions, great language, and a very likable character.  Even better, as the book wore on I found myself believing what the author was telling me.  Several times, the primary character's sense of humor left me laughing out loud with passersby giving me odd looks.<br /><br />Then I hit the 50% mark.<br /><br />\\"Surely I'm more than halfway through?  We've covered just about everything that can go right and wrong, right?\\"<br /><br />About this point, it began to drag a little, and I found myself putting it down and spending longer between reads.  Even worse, I found myself skimming ahead a bit.  \\"Yeah yeah, it's yet another complex and unexpected problem that he will work his way through.\\"<br /><br />That little self-delusion only lasted about another 5% into the book, then it grabbed me again and didn't let go until I hit the end.<br /><br />Weir, let it be said, has a demonic ability to throw in an unexpected phrase that just hits you in the gut and makes you grin like a maniac.  I am impressed.<br /><br />Well done Weir.  Like a sir.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Who would have thought ten years ago that these things were possible! Now, I am wondering just how close this is to reality.<br /><br />Very good!
B007HACDLK|4.0|A good reAd of an old favorite character. This time more of a study of the man and his associates. Ending a little weaker than expected.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I'm very happy with this app, they let me to access the camera function of my kindle fire HD. It is a great app and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to use the Kindle as a camera. or for anyone who just wants to make videos of the other friends messing around. IT has a camera feature, a video recording feature, and Apple's claim to fame, the panorama picture. Overall I'm very satisfied with the app.
B0076DELIG|4.0|the beginning captured me and i wanted to find out who killed the woman.  there were some very unreal scenarios and i think a bit more character development of others would enhance the story.  the main guy, harry, is like a bull in a china shop EVERYWHERE and in everything he does.  as a cop that seems unrealistic that he could get away doing whatever he wanted without repercussion.<br />the attention to detail in the beginning seemed to fall away as the story went on and it came to a rapid and 'all tied up in a nice bow' conclusion.<br />but still a good read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love flow free flow free, unlike other games it includes  many levels for just the free version it is by far 1 of my favorite games I've ever gotten. I specially love the puzzle aspect of it very engaging
B001MYIXAW|5.0|The title itself is a poem. The film is a stunning masterpiece of mood, emotion, elegant plot, and fantastic horror.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best games I've ever gotten it was introduced to me by one of my colleagues at school I would happily recommend it to anyone who likes Temple Run but wants something more colorful.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I bought this gift for my husband. He loved this set so much! Any hubby that loves the Bourne series will appreciate this box set.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm an avid lover of good zombie flicks and reading.  This book was different from any I had read previously in that it was told from a documentary stand. Still, it had it's times of heart pounding captivation.<br />I gave the 4 rating because of the fresh viewpoint of writing the story in documentary fashion and the scary, realistic approach that was made.  However, there were moments of slowness in the description of each person's job and their narrative of why they did what they did to survive.<br />This is a great read.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I was skeptical to read this because I wasn't sure if I would like the story plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this book! I finished reading it in two days because I just couldn't put it down! I love the characters, Cinder and Prince Kai, because they each have wonderful personalities and they both have a sense of humor. The story plot is especially intriguing because it leaves you in suspense, wondering just what will happen next. I can't wait to read the next book in The Lunar Chronicles, &#34;Scarlet.&#34; I would extremely recommend &#34;Cinder,&#34; by Marissa Meyer, to anyone who is looking for an edgy teen romance.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Dont get me wrong minecraft is an awesome game but I think the should do updates more often because I want stuff like buckets and eggs

B0073XV2W2|4.0|The scenario is pretty scary as it's based on real tech......UK government are testing Taranis autonomous drones soon......<br /><br />I like the way story integrates insect behaviour and drone technology......<br /><br />Also the manipulation of data to support a government doctrine or position or to force changes in policy to drive business.....I am sure of lot of these practices already occur in the real world......<br /><br />A good read !

B007WPLZAK|5.0|What a gripping story of love and courage!! I caught myself laughing and crying and chewing on my nails! Nicely done. Great acting and story line. There are some graphic violence scenes which I didn't care for but they went with the story line.
B000002KIT|5.0|One of the best all time live albums. Very underated live dvds. A must have for your collection. Check out Thinlizzys other albums. They are a band that did not get their share of attention in the us.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|This truly is her best album yet and I would definitely recommend buying it!  Especially her duet with Blake Shelton.  Hot!
B00637UISI|5.0|I have been a Twilight fan since I read the first book, saw the movie, and listened to three first soundtrack. The music is great. When I'm listen to the CD it takes me right back to the pary of the movie the song was playing. Love it
B003Y3UNZW|5.0|Katy Perry is a great entertainer with every song on this album making you want to get up and shake it!  I use her album to take my walks, timing moves to the beat and I love it!

0241954304|4.0|It would probably be perfectly possible these days - using Blue Tooth, WiFi and internet sites - to manufacture the \\"Fish\\" of the title - but the \\"instant translation\\" would suffer all the usual problems that David Bellos lays out for our reading in his marvelous book.<br />I do so agree with the blurb from Michael Hofmann of the UK Guardian who simply says \\"Please do read David Bellos's brilliant book.\\"
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|the game gives an amazing storyline and the puzzles always kept me guessing on what to do next and ends fantastically.

1590171993|5.0|Simply written, difficult to read, and seemingly bleak with quiet, almost secret triumphs, John Williams' Stoner is an existential masterpiece.<br /><br />William Stoner comes from a hardscrabble Missouri farm. His quiet, hardworking parents send him to the University of Missouri in 1910 to learn agriculture. In a required English survey course Stoner instead discovers within himself a love of literature and knowledge that he never knew existed. He changes his major, graduates, and becomes an English teacher at the school. In nearly 30 years at the school he never rises above the level of Associate Professor due to office politics and his refusal to compromise his academic principles. He is at times a good but not great teacher. His book is largely forgotten. He is in a bad marriage from which he cannot extricate himself. His wife removes his beloved daughter from him gradually and they both become strangers to him (Stoner's daughter was \\"almost happy with her despair\\"). One of his best friends is killed in the war. He finally finds love and then loses it due to a feud with his department head and impending scandal. Stoner encounters roadblocks at nearly every turn that would be unendurable by many.  Instead of quitting this seemingly unremarkable life, however, Stoner turns inward and to his books to find the voice for the love and passion that he cannot seem to voice himself.<br /><br />John Williams' writing style is spare, sparkling, and remarkably intense. He \\"shows\\" the reader instead of \\"telling\\" us, choosing his words carefully and with great effect. Often the story is depressing and strangely compelling at the same time. Stoner gradually realizes with deep introspection that all he really needs is already within him. \\"It seemed to him that the moment he walked in was enough, and that he might not need a great deal more.\\" Stoner is an existential hero,  bringing meaning to his own life in the face of the absurd. As in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard, Stoner lives his life \\"authentically,\\" finding sincerity and passion in his own way.<br /><br />Many will find Stoner to be depressing reading, but do not overlook the power of the book's understated, quiet resolve in the face of problems that many writers would solve with a quick fix and a Hollywood ending. Stoner is about the inner life of a regular, everyday man searching for meaning in an unfair world, and author John Williams does not compromise one iota in the telling. This brilliant, important work, largely overlooked since its publication in 1965, deserves a larger readership and much wider acclaim.<br /><br />Special Note: Williams' similarly minimalist, bleak and brutal western novel Butcher's Crossing is said to have paved the way for Cormac McCarthy (Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West, which I read and reviewed last year). Morris Dickstein in the New York Times called Butcher's Crossing \\"...perhaps the first and best revisionist western.\\"er lives his life \\"authentically,\\" finding sincerity and passion in his own way.<br /><br />Many will find Stoner to be depressing reading, but do not overlook the power of the book's understated, quiet resolve in the face of problems that many writers would solve with a quick fix and a Hollywood ending.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting Story and a real page turner, I loved it and can't wait for the next one. It was my favorite of the series so far.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|LaBeouf does a great job in this movie. I live in VA so the story equally interesting. Good movie choice
B004OT2WKO|5.0|I gout this for my usband for Christmas. It is amazing. He loved it, but, I am afraid it will sit in the box for a while as our house is tiny and there isn't a lot of room for leaving this out. I will definately keep the Technic items in mind for future birthdays and Christmas'.
0449011917|5.0|Every Game of Thrones book gets better and better. I read the books out of order because they didn't have all of the audio books in the library, but oddly enough it didn't matter if I knew how book 5 ended because the descriptions and detail are so vivid.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Lots of action, twists and adventure...Can't help but fall in love with the characters. As a lover of supernatural this is a must have.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|enjoyable<br />I think this game could also show kids some of the responsibility that goes along with owning a horse.  it is also a good clean game that is not violent.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Unbelievable exploitation. The excess of language did not add to this stupid waste of film. Five more words of disgust.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|It is much better than the stock Android one. A really fast browser. I would recommend it as a good alternative to the default one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very erotic and intriguing. Could not put the book down. I know my husband appreciated me reading it. A definite must read.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I say it glitches whenever you play it. Water falls and ziplines are new.I can't wait for temple run three<br />3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yet graphics are fine FIX THE GLITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|All the things I wrote in my review for the book, apply to this film as well. And that says a lot since the book made me have really high hopes for the film. I had all these images in my head already and needed the film to do it justice. And it didn't let me down!<br />Even the hubby watched the movie and loved it! That says a lot, he's quite picky.<br />I laughed and cried in all the same spots as the book, well it was so accurate a film. Really, there was no spots I would have done differently. Ang Lee is a fantastic director, and his eye is perfect for what this vivid movie needed to express the story. There really is not much dialogue so he had to be creative in filming, and he was.<br />I can see this stealing the show at all the awards this year. Definitely.<br /><br />My new favorite movie. Ever.
B00AYQNOU8|4.0|Many beautiful scenes, many thought provoking scenes.  I felt that some scenes were held too long though, and I had to fast forward the scenes of the way that chickens and cows are handled inhumanely in our food production.  People need to realize that ALL beings deserve respect and a good life.
0142420891|5.0|I'm not sure if I can form words for this one. As weird as this may sound this book was beautiful. The writing was perfect. The storyline was so moving. I was so happy to read more about the characters. As soon as I finished this I wanted to reread it. It was amazing.<br /><br />I loved getting to read from Adam's perspective. I learned so much about him. He's not the type of guy I normally like but I absolutely adore him. His story was so moving. He really had to find himself before he could move forward. I found it admirable how much he was willing to give up for Mia. He made her a promise and no matter how hard it was for him he was willing to keep it. It was intriguing to see Adam and Mia repair their relationship. They were having some real problems. I loved how everything turned out. I even did a little happy dance :). Everything worked out perfectly. There was even some cute parts for me to love. Both Adam and Mia are amazing characters. I enjoyed reading about their story so much. I'm gonna miss them!<br /><br />3 years can change a lot. Not just in life but in relationships and in yourself. How far are two people willing to go for love? 3 years changed a lot for Adam and Mia. They didn't even know each other anymore. They were living different, busy, and crazy lives. And then, they rekindled the amazing relationship they had before and it was beautiful. There really is so much to be taken from this book. Just one day fixed all their problems. Overall this book was brilliant(in the words of Ron Weasley). I loved it with all my heart! If you haven't read this series you have too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very fun game that includes the tracks turning/ ropes/ mine carts and a ton more awesome things that aren't included in the original  Temple Run.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I am not a fan of Phantom of the Opera AT ALL . I bought this for my wife who definitely is. She already had the movie production on cd and watched this production somewhere and loved it, so I bought it for her. She was thrilled!!  I scored points,so everyone wins :) .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is like owning a real horse. You get to feed train and clean up after your horse.<br />I enjoy playing you should give it a try.
B00846REIS|4.0|Thought it was quite different than \\"Fifty Shades\\". Ms. Day is a true artist in writing this book. Truly a good read.
B00B44XVZC|3.0|So it took until the 18th volume of Fables to hit a bump in the road. Does this make it bad? No, but I didn't find this volume as engrossing as those previous. I found the story less than compelling, and to be honest, a bit stretched out. It could have been done in less issues, or perhaps a bit more could have been done in the mundy world. Having said that, I'm still looking forward to the next volume.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I wont do free again if that is add intensive, I want the game not the junk, wont get a game from
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the John Green that made me fall in love with his books. Just when you think you know the ending it changes. It's a heartfelt, heart-wrenching story of love and loss and the beauty of a first true love.
B004TI5N38|5.0|It's hard to find an author who gives an action story with a great plot and keep it clean. It goes to show that it is not a prerequisite to insert swearing and sexual situations into the story line of a great read.<br /><br />This story is believable, fast paced and true to military standards. I am reading out of sequence but will go back to number one.
0061998885|3.0|This was my first Lehane book and what I found good about it was its pace. Something about it flowed and that made for a fun reading. I would definitely try another Lehane book because I  seem to sense the likelihood of there being just a better one out there, excluding both Mystic River or Gone, Baby, Gone, because I already know they are good movies and therefore good books.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This app exceeded my expectations!  The prompts between workouts are perfect. Very glad there is no counting during the workout. That allows me to do the exercises at my pace without being distracted by a count or feeling as if I need to go faster or slow down. Thanks for a super app that will help me get a proper at home workout!
B000ICZD5M|2.0|I only downloaded this for my husband.  He liked it, but I thought it was extra boring.  I couldn't follow it, and I totally hated the flying man with boils on his face.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Like a classic favorite. Easy to play and great graphics. A fun game for the entire household. Hard to put down!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I'm a hard-science science fiction fan and would rather read hard sc-fi than almost anything. I love stories and movies about Mars, and I'm a fan of survival, castaway, and man-against-the elements stories. I loved Robinson Crusoe, so it should not surprise you that I loved the movie, Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I realize it's not Academy Award material, but to me, it's everything I want it to be, as was this book, The Martian.<br /><br />The main character, Watney, presumed dead, is accidentally left by his crew mates when an intense Martian dust storm forces them to abort their mission. What follows for part of the book is a logbook style narrative that describes in great technical detail Watney's efforts to extend his life until the next scheduled mission arrives in 4 years. After reading just the first 20% of the book (my Kindle has no page numbers) one can't help but be impressed by the author's depth of knowledge in this regard. In fact, the entire book is an astronaut's primer on extraterrestrial and deep space survival and rescue.<br /><br />The Martian isn't without its typos and editorial glitches, and I'm not sure if this was a result of a bad Kindle conversion or just a shortsighted editor. For me, though, typos and editing issues paled in comparison to the snowballing storyline, which I gladly admit is not for everyone.<br /><br />This is not a touchy-feely book about love, romance or relationships. There is no overpowering angle between characters. No good guys in white hats and bad guys in black hats. There's no room for cliches. It's all very business like and scientific. So, if you're looking for Twilight in Space. Or Fifty Shades of Mars. Or Tom Hanks making himself a friend by drawing a face on a soccer ball, you'll probably want to skip this one. This book is simply about the mission, and the cold reality of working hard to turn a wrong into a right.<br /><br />Another thing you won't find in this book is a lot of heartfelt reminiscing or reflection. There are no flashbacks of our main character fishing with Dad at the old water hole, or him riding his first bicycle without training wheels. This is a book about a guy with a keen intellect surviving on a hostile planet and doing so by making the most out of a given set of resources.<br /><br />About a third of the way through the book, the author adds third person narratives from mission control and the Hermes space craft, the latter manned by the crew that left our hero behind -- and make no mistake, hero is the operative word. Again, we don't follow our mission control cast of characters back too their respective homes and meet their wives and husbands and get served up cliche insights into their innermost thoughts. Blech! I hate those stories! Which doesn't mean these characters are cookie cutter or superficial. On the contrary, I found the characters sufficiently individuated and interesting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to people who are into reading hard sci-fi of the not-too-distant future, sci-fi without blasters and ray guns or 9' tall aliens that bleed acid. (Btw, I like those stories, too, but good ones are hard to find.)<br /><br />Somebody did their homework on this one -- and that's what stands out above all else..

B006LSZECO|3.0|Difficult to get into. Finally hooks you so that you wish to get to the end. At times, choice of words seem to be included just to keep the interest of immature readers.<br />Format is different and forces one to recap the setting of the previous account.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie was awesome! Hands down the best action movie I have seen in ages.  It was so great, I immediately watched it a second time - and I rarely watch movies twice period!  Dredd's lines are all so down to earth, gritty, ruthless, but yet always just.  He is an awesome hero!  I tell, I want to go read the comics after seeing this.  Soundtrack is really amazing as well.<br /><br />This may well be the best action movie of all time, surpassing Die Hard and The Killer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much better than original temple run, addictive, my kids love this new game. Road is more curved, rope is better
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I felt like it started off kinda slow and half the time sky's relationship with Dean annoyed me. I don't really like that they kinda just cut out her best friend 6 what was the point of that character anyway.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|i love this gamepad... it take a little while to get used to but once you do you'll never go back to a keyboard!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|An absolutely involving &#34;historical&#34; novel. The plot is constantly in motion, page by page. It's a fanastically well-researched story, set in an age few of us know anything about. A Follet triumph, I'd say.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I can't make it work it doesn't want to play unless Im doing something wrong can someone help me play
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game with amazing graphics. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games. It works wonderfully on my new kindle fire.
B004132HZS|5.0|I am speechless all I can really say is thank you for the great price offer! This show is absolutely amazing, Thanks for making it possible to buy at a reasonable price!
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|I didn't like this movie. It was weird and disturbing to watch. The characters were creepy and not at all endearing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has done it again. This was another page turner and a great follow up to &#34; The Fall of Giants&#34;. I can't wait for the final book of this trilogy.
B000V39KDO|1.0|It was a terrible movie for a woman of color to watch. Why were the heroes all white anglosaxon men while all the people of color were 'evil'.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the ending was a bit vague.....but the book did keep my interest through out. It was a must read for anyone who read the first two books.......
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I was unable to find it in any local stores so Amazon was my saving grace. This is spectacular on blu-ray and definitely worth the price. It was in great condition when it arrived and played perfectly, no blemishes, and was a good price!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|ok it unlocked the whistle bonus once and a puzzle piece fell off the side and I dindnt get that bonus clearly said that I get ALL prizes that fall off the side! the puzzle piece IS a prize! otherwise a great game
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I can not wait to read the second book in the Crossfire novel collection.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I expected this would be a family movie to entertain all audiences in my household. The adults liked it. The animation and motion capture was excellent. I had never heard of the Tintin books, so I also enjoyed the history clip telling about how the movie came to film
B00AE2I4WK|1.0|Apart from the dance choreography - this movie was such a dud.  I really shouldn't have wasted my money! So disappointed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait for the third book!  This was a great continuation from the first book, Fall of Giants, or could be a stand alone.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Games pretty fun. Its simple and easy to play. Sometimes it glitches but that doesnt happen often. Also sometimes the ponies dont appear and I have to restart it. Its also quite addicting. Game loft id kekarieng
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the fourth of Morton;s books that I have read. I enjoyed them all but I think it is the best. Her characters are rich and so well developed. They evolve over time with subtle twists and turns. She is a masterful story-teller. I can't wait for her next book.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Reminds me of Freddy Mercury, kid can sing and the group is amazingly talented.  Don't let the fan girls run you off from this group, they have a lot to offer.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Wouldn't expect anything less....What an excellent book. I would recommend this book to anyone. Ready for the next one. Yes!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first temple run.It's not that challenging can't wait till they make the third one.
0688152023|5.0|I love all things ballet!  I purchased the DVD set before even knowing there was a book.  I was truly thrilled to have the whole set in my ballet repertoire!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this game and I can not stop playing this game and my 5year-old girl loves it. We both are wasting time, well time goes by playing this game. If you are looking at this game ......It would be a good choice to get it.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|I tried the app but found it a little confusing to play the game. If you like to play racing games then give it a try.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful application. I really enjoy all the different versions available. The devotionals are full of encouragement. The concordance is good for looking up specific information.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I still wanted to know where the story went and why Christian started acting in the way he does, strange person
B0096HI226|5.0|I really liked it..but didn't like the end. Wish it would have been more on how Mike did for the future.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the series, glad my granddaughter got me interested in the series, it showed a great deal of imagination.  Fun to see where the characters go.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I can't believe how amazing this book was, it was so hard to put it down. I got the audio narration and highly recommend it .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book because my granddaughter was going to see the movie and I wasn't too thrilled with her going to see a movie about kids hunting and killing each other.  The book changed my mind, it was well done without being super gory.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book was good this book is about Greg and how he likes holly hills are they going to live a life happily ever after you find out Cristina
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I guess I'm just not into the strange sex, but I did read to see where the story line was going.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|my son loves this app and  all of the dr panda app. He's 21 months and can work all the games by himself. while learning to sort, colors, cleaning this is a great app
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The story line was pretty good, but I could have done without most of the kinky sex stuff, still didn't understand his mindset.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really fun game great for kids and adults!<br />Really cool obstacles and great people to get and its really fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept the story going without getting boring.  Needed to see where the character's went from the first book.  Going to read the last book too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a very fun app especially if you like horses like me. You get to train them for competitions, and feed them.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It's pretty convincing in it's proof that Heaven exists.  It's amazing that this man lived through this experience with so little lingering problems.  Sharing the book with family and friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So addicting and so much fun. I thought it was just going to be like the first one but NO much greater and more exciting AWSOME game
0765325950|5.0|It's kind of strange to know that there won't be another Wheel of Time book coming out next year.<br /><br />Well, at least this one wraps up a lot of things nicely. A lot of people die (it *is* the last battle after all) a lot of people make it. A lot of new things are revealed, a lot of old things finally make sense. Of course, my favorite character had to die. Not saying who, since that would be a spoiler. But strangely enough, it doesn't really feel like they're dead, since we won't get to read about any of the characters anymore anyway. The characters all live with me.<br /><br />Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson do a really good job of making you care about the characters and what happens to them. Like any fan of the series, I was worried about how Sanderson would do, picking up where Jordan left off. BUT, (and I may get torn apart for saying this) I actually think I like Sanderson's writing more... I know, I know. It just seems like he gets to the action more - which could have a lot to do with the fact that he only had to write the final books where the character development was already established.<br /><br />It's strange how, each time after finishing one of these books, I feel like I need to talk like these characters. I find myself thinking \\"Light!\\" in my head whenever the situation warrants. Apparently I'm very easily influenced.<br /><br />Of course, there are still some things that don't *quite* make sense to me, or that weren't explained fully - maybe so that when you go back and read the whole thing over, it won't be like everything has been handed to you. You'll still have to work for some things to make sense. But maybe that's also why it feels like the characters still live on - because you don't necessarily know what happens to everyone after. I'm still mulling.<br /><br />Regardless, it was a good ending, the last battle was amazing (and I usually skim through battle chapters - not so with this one since it was all engaging and interesting - good thing since I would have been skimming through most of the book!) and the entire thing was really well done. Bravo Jordan and Sanderson!good thing since I would have been skimming through most of the book!) and the entire thing was really well done. Bravo Jordan and Sanderson!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy read more about the fact that god enable us to know and understand what Jesus went through for us
B0000TB014|5.0|This film contains a lot of his songs. No interruptions through out videos like director talking. Takes you back in time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it was the best game I ever play in life it was under this the pa3 but not dot cool then Lockwood
1573300403|5.0|This film contains a lot of his old songs. No interruptions through out videos like director talking. Takes you back in time.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|The baby loves them.  She especially loves to grab them and remove them from her feet!  They are well made.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The fantasy of meeting the gorgeous millionaire is fun. However, the writing is not great. She tends to overuse certain phrases. Believe it or not, the sex gets repetitive. Still a fun escape though.<br />The biggest problem I had with the book was editing. Some scenes could have been cut entirely. And most glaring is the fact that the characters don't sound American. I wouldn't expect Ms.James to necessarily know when she is making these types of errors. That's where the editor should have come in and fixed the problem. Otherwise, change the setting to England.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This is an overly simplistic plot with excruciatingly annoying characters. The protagonist male is comically self absorbed in a post traumatic state. It is hard to understand what that must be like, but as it is written, it is hard to see him as anything more than infantile. The mother and father characters are cliche at best. And the character of Tiffany made me want to pull out my hair. Who behaves this way?<br /><br />My wife and I read this book together...mini book club if you will. Sadly I take ownership of making this pick. I got sucked in by the rave reviews of the movie. Shame on me.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was a fun read, and the plot is better developed here than in the first two. However, this book still has the problems of the previous two novels.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I suppose it depends on the child and how he/she responds to this item, but if you can make it available just before they start to walk AND they take to it, it is a perfect toy AND tool. My grandson took off with it, but since it was iffy before the purchase, I give it four stars.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one. I couldn't put it down. Fans of The Hunger Games will enjoy this book.
B00APUU7S0|2.0|They put Bruce Willis on the cover, but he really phoned this in. He seems to be doing some DVD movies on the side that take like two days for him to shoot.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Biting guitar riffs, some perfect tracks mixed in with some absolute masterpieces and the guitar work on most tracks is sublime... just love this album and am playing it again and again.. dare we compare this guy to other past rock/blues legends......
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is like Harry Potter for adults. It is so creative and enticing. The world Morgenstern creates sparkles with imagination and pulls you in. The relationships between characters are believable and satisfying. This was a great read!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I absolutely love my Apple AV adapter!  It is awesome and a much more reasonabally priced accessory than the Apple TV.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|kept my interest all the wayn through... 2nd book of his i have read...both excellant... going to buy the next in this series
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is beautiful with a textured black outer with a leather spine. The case is extremely useful and functional with a secure hold on the Kindle and an elastic strap to secure the case in the closed position. The cover flips open and becomes a stand of sorts allowing ease of use when watching a movie or listening to music on the kindle, I also use this for when I am reading. The BEST feature in my eyes is the super soft inner that touches the screen, it is very nice and is not going to scratch or scuff my screen. Great case, highly recommend!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's your typical love story with a couple twists and turns!  I definitely couldn't put it down, and read it in about a day or so.  If you are looking for a happily ever after, this book is for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is amazing. Great cast. Keeps you on edge the whole time. It is very addictive. Can't wait for season 4 to start.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I like this game and all but it. will. not. work! when I swipe it won't listen and after a week it reset! I had nearly 30000 coins, earning super mystery boxes, and I had three characters! this game is stupid. I cannot tell you how angry I am right now at Kiloo. if you wanna get a good game, get temple run two.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm sad this book is over. But I can't go through reading them again. Overall I really enjoyed the trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw this game and I knew it was fun! Its better then temple run. I'm 14 years old and my sister is 15 years old.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its the best game I have on my kindle fire.I'm glad they came out with a second version.Love it!!! I hope they come out with a third....
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game, good graphics, variety in activities. I recommend as a good time waster for adults and kids. Enjoy this game.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its fun to play the old tamogachi style. it would be nice to have more horse interaction rather than tasks that aren't even played.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app, this game is so fun to play. you should get this game if you love horses.
1401311091|3.0|read the book relentlessly and finish in two days. then i digest what read . i have been waiting for the hard copy to come out and was anxious to read it. after i realated the new charactor names to the TV show i was ok . finished the book qquickly as it flowed well. but i just give it 3 stars as it was just as the tv series.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|As a whole, I love this case for my Fire HD 8.9. The leather is soft, very high quality and I've gotten compliments on it. The spin feature was one of the main reason why I chose this case. But after a month of use, I find I don't use the spin as much as I thought I would. I typically just have the Kindle on my lap and if I did use the stand feature, it is almost always in the portrait view. But it is still nice having that feature if I need it. Yes the spin requires two hands to turn but I think it's a good thing since I wouldn't want my Kindle moving or wiggling.<br /><br />It was easy to snap the Kindle into the holder but it is so tight that I cannot pop it out with just my fingers like the Marware video shows. Luckily I don't need to take it out of the case very often so really a minor quirk.<br /><br />The second quirk is the auto shut off feature when the lid is closed. For the most part, the Kindle will shut off in both rotation positions  (ports facing out or facing in) but it seems to be more consistent with the ports facing in. The quirk is really about keeping the Kindle off. The lid doesn't lay flat against the Kindle and is raised just enough to where it would trigger the auto on. This happens more often with the ports facing out, which is the position it's usually in.  The screen will eventually shut off but it's still a bit annoying to me. I found two solutions to this. One, use the strap to keep it closed. Second, if not using the strap, flip the whole thing over so that the Kindle screen is facing down and the top cover is on the bottom. Again, a minor quirk for me that I can live with since this really is a great case.<br /><br />A note about the strap. It's some kind of elastic, like my hair band. So only time will tell as to it's longevity with daily use. I'm hoping it's more durable than it seems. I only mention this because of my previous experience with another Marware product for my iPod. It had a similar type of elastic that eventually ripped away from the case. But the case was not leather and the stitching wasn't as high quality as this case.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this show! We watched this in one day! Hours of laughing! This was shipped quickly and we had no problems with the disks.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Not just &#34;feel good&#34;, it's a &#34;feel great&#34; movie! Being in Indian, always loved to see our culture from a westerner's eye.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show! We watched this in one day! Hours of laughing! This was shipped quickly and we had no problems with the disks.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|This movie was great!! Lots of action and a great story line. Plus I love Justin Timberlake. Anyway this movie was good and it got here quickly. I would strongly recommend it :)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|As the title suggests I am surprised to see how big this game has gotten.  It is a decent game, especially for children, and the challenge scales up nicely with each level.  That said there are many good games that fit this same mold.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book so much but it just gets better and better each time best book ever do read it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It took a few chapters to really get into the book, but after I did the story line was great!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|works better on fire then on my iphone. doesn't have full desktop capabilities but good enough for tablet, I guess. hope they'll enhance it with more functionality
0143119680|4.0|Fun and great service. A must read if u are into the hole witch thing and even if u ain't still hard to put down
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is a stellar performance as a Dredd takes off where Sylvester Stallone left off and is a great futuristic action film. Lots of action, shooting and violence in this one.
B007MGWBU2|2.0|I was a big fan of &#34;The Muppets.&#34; I am a Jason Segal fan. To say that I was disappointed in this movie is an understatement. The concept may have been okay, but the writing and execution just plain miss the mark. The film is really uneven, and basically vacillates between &#34;meh&#34; and bad/boring. It does not capture the fun/funny essence of the original TV series or movies.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the originals, don't waste your time or money.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I loved Shia in this movie, great storyline and plot and deliverance throughout the movie was fantastic...I love watching this actor!!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Wow! Terrific documentary, great story and great music. Of course, after watching the movie, I had to buy his CDs.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I am so happy Colin got clean and I am proud of him!!! He did an amazing job with this movie! An old movie with a new twist, sorry Arnold I love this one more!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love it !! works well has many uses and works awesome love the fact that it notifies you when you have a low battery
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is great. It is nice having a dictionary at your fingertips. It is easy to use and very thorough.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book caught my intense interest from page one.  I truly enjoy a good mystery and this had all sorts of plot turns right up to the ending.  Having read several David Baldacci books, I truly believe that this one rates as one of his best.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|awesome. good for young children. allows them to enjoy having pets and being responsible but also to have fun. I really enjoy it as much as my neices do.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like the game. but I whis the prises. could be faster and lots of coins too. 4 stars ;-)
B000F1IQMS|5.0|I ordered several of these DVD's because I wanted to give them to several people.  This movie is spot on for this day and age of our war on terrorism.  If you have never seen this movie, order it now while the price is much lower than shipping.
1476719071|1.0|I read this book based on a recommendation.  There are just so many crazy aspects to this story that aren't supported throughout the book.  I realize it is fiction, but it was so bad that it was distracting.  This from a fan of urban fantasy - so I can do crazy, I just require it to be explained or supported in the rest of the text.  I am also a fan of angsty romance and redeeming the bad boy, but this is just too much.<br />* Abby is 18-19, at some very small college, and we find out her Dad is broke and doesn't know where she is, and her Mom an alcoholic.  Where is all of her money coming from?  Besides the surprise $11,000 she has won betting on Travis??  How is she paying for school?<br />*These college kids are walking around with 100 bills and 50's in their wallets?<br />*Bizarre spur of the moment jaunt for four to Vegas to win crazy money to (partially) pay off the mobster.  The kids can afford expensive airfare, hotels, fancy dresses for the girls, but evidently she can only gamble at the one casino and still can't make her dad's full payment.  But she is certain that this violent mobster that will not hesitate to hurt her dad will take the partial payment.<br />*America and Shepley are madly in love and at the very beginning of the school year.  Travis and Abby go from meeting for the first time to marriage in less than 6 months. These girls are only 18/19?!<br />*Travis is totally unstable.  Violent, possessive, insecure, definitely leaning towards stalker.  Seriously - Travis beats the crap out of a kid in the cafeteria of this tiny school and there are no consequences from the administration?<br />*Abby is ridiculous - Before getting romantic with Travis, but while sharing his bed every night, she accepts a diamond bracelet after a few dates from Travis' fraternity brother and doesn't give it back when she dumps him for Travis just days later.  After she breaks up with Travis and breaks his heart, she callously shows up at his apartment, at his fraternity Valentine party (even though it is with her gay friend who barely makes an appearance in the book), hangs out again with the first fraternity brother she dated in the story.  Seriously unlikeable girl.<br />*Abby is a virgin, but is good with calculating which day in her cycle is good for unprotected sex within 2 days of becoming sexually active.  Unprotected sex with a guy who has been having one time encounters with many, many girls.<br /><br />There is so much good romance available and so much good YA fiction available that it's a shame that this is so popular.  I read half of this last night and the rest today, so I was as absorbed in the story as possible.  Still couldn't feel good about this book.  I mainly felt appalled at the characters lack of redeeming qualities and concerned/disappointed/disturbed that this is the type of romance that readers find appealing.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Too much back and forth. Didn't bother me to put the story down and take a break. Loved some of his other books so much more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written, I can not understand all the bad press and threats from the government especially the Pentagon trying to attack the thoughts and experience of this gift to our nation &#34;A True Warrior&#34;. We and I mean every American owe this man all the respect and gratitude for his sacrifice.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album blew me away! I'm always on the prowl for new music that is adventurous, startling, and soul-piercing. This album has music that will make the hair on your arms stand straight up. It electrifies and amazes. I think this may be the best album this year! And strangely, I don't like rap that much, but this goes beyond rap. This is the first rap album that I have bought, and I recommend that everyone do the same.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome!!!! Way way better then the first one! !!!!!! There is more stuff than the first one! !! If u wanna know what they are then get the game yourself!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was surprised i would like a young adult story so much. Very well written. Kept me reading. Would read this author again.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I loved this app! about a day later it wouldn't open on my fire so I uninstalled the app hopping just redownloading would help. when I went back it said open app and nothing happened :(
B00008H2LB|4.0|This is quintessential Linkin Park. I must say I'm addicted to track 6: &#34;Easier to Run&#34;. That song is amazing! Every song on this CD is good and some are very beautiful / incredible. Recommended to all Linkin Park fans.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a big fan of Nelson DeMille, especially the John Corey series, but this book highly disappointed.  Over 600 pages, of which at least 500 were travelogue and history lesson.  I noticed whole paragraphs repeating themselves throughout the book. Corey's wife, Kate, could just have easily not been in the book at all.  This felt very much like a book thrown together in a short period of time to fulfill an obligation to the publisher.
B00574P964|5.0|Watched this with my kids and got a good laugh out of it.  This is a great movie for kids, I highly recommend it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kept me interested.  Did not see the ending coming.  Total surprise.  Good book, but not author's best.  I would recommend.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I think I liked ASOS better but only because this book is like half of the story. Aryas progression is way cool.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Y'all got Temple Run 2 quick as sh** but no instagram tho??? -__- its a good app tho but seriously like wtf?
B000FS9FCG|5.0|When I watched this movie last night, i was so surprised that it's not just a typical action movie.<br />It goes way beyond.<br />The acting, the camera, the script, they all are almost perfect.<br />It's a DVD so if it is at night, there's a lot of grains in the back. Picture quality above all is all right but not even close to HD. Even consider that it's a DVD, it's just so so.<br />I wished I bought the Bluray.<br />It became one of my best movie instantly.<br /><br />I remember I watched this film long long time ago, but couldn't remember.<br />Maybe I was not concentrating  enough at that time.<br /><br />Go buy this title in Bluray if you want instead of DVD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|funfunfun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun<br />i loved this app at first but it started to get borring.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The Pact is a sobering look at how people truly do not realize how much their interpretation of happiness and expectations can muddle a child's life.  This is a harrowing tale of love and heartache that was a quick read o a difficult topic. A must read.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Very fun game and very addicting. I love the way these plates look and I wish restaurants had some food that looked like this.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I have played the piano for 35+ years and I find this program to be fun and annoying at the same time. I wish the floating bars had the notes on them for my son who is teaching himself to play on our real piano. He likes to play by ear, but I am trying to emphasize the note names as he plays. I enjoy playing the well-known pieces, but timing two keys together is tricky, and if you don't hit them at the same nano-second in the right sequence, you end up missing a note. Whenever you miss a note, the song stops and you can't move forward until you go back and hit that single key, even if it sounds odd and out of sequence. I think there is an option to disable this feature. I have loaded it onto my son's FreeTime page, thought, because he really does enjoy &#34;playing&#34; the songs.
B004ZQBOXC|4.0|Really enjoying this album. Fun music, great for parties and dancing.<br /><br />Love how they don't really take this album seriously, it's all for the music and the fun of it all.<br /><br />My two favorite songs in the album are, Party Rock Anthem (of course) and Champagne Showers.<br />There are more songs that I pretty much play in repeat alongside these though.
0956494242|5.0|I am a Jane Austen fan, and have read many of her books. This particular hardcover edition, of Sense and Sensibility, has exceptional quality. To begin with, it is the Bath Bicentenary illustrated edition. I must say, the colorful illustrations are quite beautiful. The story of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", centers on the unique bond and differences, two sisters in one family have. Both sisters have very different personalities, and opinions on life. As the story develops, the reader is able to learn how each sister reacts, to her own life experiences. I purchased this hardcover book, for my sister's birthday this year.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded it yesterday and played it like 2 or 3 times and it wouldn't work it had to keep being reinstalled and it is still installing
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Very fun. If u like leveling up then u will enjoy thus game. It is free so u can beat that. Take the challenge.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is better than the first, but can freeze up. I had to remove the app and redownload. I haven't seen anything else about this, so it must just be me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I hope you love this app I know I love it and if you have kids this would be a good game for them to play. hope my review helped you thanks bye.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|First off, they all sound the same.  GREAT.<br />Then they are different.  ROCK.<br />Then, they're in your head....<br />And you find true north<br /><br />True North!
B005LAII3A|2.0|Save your dollars<br /><br />Bought this remake thinking it would be even better than the first, with all the new technology, etc.  If you like movies that are hard to see because the scenes are mostly dark, and have to read the synopsis to know they are entering the other side of the earth through a &#34;drill&#34;, then this one is for you.  Not my taste; Arnold has my vote on the first one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What's not to love? Great new graphics, jumps, slides. Even new characters you can be! Works perfectly on my kindle fire. No glitches at all.
0307352145|5.0|Thanks to this book I`ve understood myself, and I know that I`m a little bit socialized introvert and I love it!!!!!
B0000214F1|3.0|I am not really sure of the details of this movie really happened in real life in Rome.  Some scenes are too overacted and overblown.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|Usually the sequels don't do justice to the original but this one was hilarious. Bradley Cooper was pretty funny. The supporting actors were good as well.
B0024O0VVS|4.0|Watch out this version is in Italian with no English subtitles.  But it is a great movie worth watching again and again.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Liam Neeson is great in this one. Perfect role for him. Original storyline and good character development.<br />I am dying to see the second one.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|imediashare is the best app ever!!  I use it on my kindle fire and it works really good on apple TV!  No problems!!!
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|I loved Sean Penn's acting in this one as well as Brad Pitt's. Tree of Life is a must see. Some scenes were slow in some parts but overall visually stunning.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|This was recommended to me for file management.  I loaded the baby up and gee, now what?  Have no idea how to use it and after trying to figure it out, deleted it.  I can manage my files just fine without this, thank you very much.
B0092QITO2|4.0|I liked the remake of Total Recall much better than the original because of the action scenes and special effects. I also liked Jessica Biel and Kate Beckingsale in it.
0810996596|5.0|Kirk Hammett is one of my favorite musicians, and I'm also his same age. Like him, I grew up with Creature Features on tv, and seeing some pretty intense horror films at a young age, 'cause my Dad loves horror, too.<br />I love horror SO much, I've performed as a zombie in flash mobs and Michael Jackson Thriller tributes.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous book with super-cool toys, masks, vintage props, and beautiful movie poster art.<br />Kirk wrote all the captions himself, revealing the gleeful little boy side of him,<br />and his passion for these items is contagious.<br /><br />What surprised me the most about the book, is that it's also an in-depth look into Kirk's inner psyche,<br />and if you're a hard-core fan of Kirk, and of Metallica's music, like me, you learn just how much inspiration his collection gives him as a musician, and it's really fascinating.<br /><br />There's even more in his collection, that didn't make it into this book.<br /><br />I also like his decision to have the book only available in hard copy...<br />Kirk wants the reader to have a tangible, physical experience with this lovely book.<br /><br />I showed the book to my Dad one day, and my Dad poured over every single page, he really enjoyed it, too.<br />He's a semi-retired newspaper editor, and was really impressed with the quality of the book.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great story...couldn't put it down.  This book was straight forward but moving.  And it broke my heart when they couldn't be together...
0525953590|5.0|The Higgs boson is in the news, and this book is brilliant at explaining what it is.<br />The writer is able to put complicated ideas into simple words, and I came to experience the imaginative arts which are at the heart of the most advanced science.<br />It is a thrilling read - my mind boggled and then expanded.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was recommended to me by another nursing mother.  It is a beautiful story about a boy and his mother and the horrible things they must endure together, and it is all told from the child's point of view.  It shows the bonds that can exist between a mother and her  child, and surprisingly, the nursing relationship most women could have without the pressures of society telling us to \\"cut the cord.\\"<br /><br />The best book I have read in a long time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever buy it  cause I did and I love it but I wish I could have signs and buckets but still it's awesome I can't stop playing well got to back playing the BEST GAME EVER
076790592X|5.0|life changing book. ive lent this book to many people and everyone else has loved it also. if you havent had a chance to read it go buy it. easy read but it was a gateway book for me to back into reading.
B005T87QCI|3.0|They should add all the other robots like on the iPod it would make it a lot funner if they did
B000FC1HBY|4.0|It was good. Make sure you have lots of time to devote to it. Awesome series if you enjoy fantasy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Rom Com meets Glee loved the entertainment factor!  Thanks!  The humor was great!  As were the vocal performances!  I enjoyed the throw-back to Breakfast Club!
B0067AC5KA|4.0|I read \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. I bought the trilogy through kindle and started from the beginning. The second one is by far the best from this avid reader's opinion. I thought it would be #3, but the random portion b/f the end was a bit of a let down. I still enjoyed the series and will enjoy it again like I do all good stories. Definitely recommended
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I started it recently and savor the little blocks of time I get to read it. I know the ending is going to be really good.<br />I haven't been this excited about reading a book in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense and twists and turns.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is so much fun and it's addicting. It's easier than some of the other games like this. Not too frustrating.
0553582461|5.0|\\"I have never been wise.\\" I actually thought I could hold out for George R.R. Martin's next book on March 31, 2013. But after picking up and finishing Robin Hobb's Farseer and Tawny Man Trilogies I feel I have come away knowing there is some good Fantasy Sci Fi out there. Robin Hobb's Tawny Man Trilogy tells the story of a hero's journey.  A story about a man who has been abandoned, tortured, cheated, beaten, humiliated, hunted, spurned and scorned.  Yes he won the war but it left him emotionally disabled.  Robin provides intimate details that show how everybody wants him to just recover, come back, see how he has wronged them and has been selfish with his absence.  His family and friends can't see the problem with poor Fitz's reluctance to continue on. They think it should be easy for the hero to accept his sacrifice, roll over and become the hero as needed again. Robin was masterful in how she took us through Fitz's fear, emotional pain and confusion over how best to address his world and bring the reality of past and present together. She showed him truly failing at restarting his life until the Fool's Fate was real. For this reason and many others, I found the Tawny Man Trilogy an emotionally believable heroic story. Yet, I find it hard to believe that a man who goes through all of this and then guides his daughter in following his footsteps hasn't another story to tell. With this being the case, I had to resign myself to trust the story teller. So, so long Fitz.<br /><br />Like many others, after reading the Farseer Trilogy, I got hooked on the Fitz and Fool characters. I could not set them aside to read Liveship Traders even though it boasts a steady 4-stars from reviewers. I wanted to know WHAT HAPPENED to Fitz and the Fool. They made a great pair.  I also got wrapped up in Fitz's pyschosis and believed almost to the end that the Fool maintained a disguise to hide his gender.  Robin Hobb is also a master at creating characters that map well with the tone of the book. For instance, the character Jinna in the Trilogy brought up very real issues about Fitz's pyschosis and what it wrought. She may have had the knowledge and magic to guide him toward healing his emotional wounds. But her timing went off when she fell into the pleasure of her own magic.  Could Jinna have invented a charm preventing Fitz from future poisoning or one to determine lies from truth?  As a result, Robin showed how a trick of timing caused them both to lose at friendship and more. So we find the Fitz character running again and never emotionally healing from yet another horrendous physical wound. One story that could expand the Fitz and Fool relationship and spur another series may be that of the Pale Woman and her numerous catalysts.  I can see easily how Chades' youthful exploits before his exile may tie in. Just thinking!!<br /><br />Robin, thanks for a good read and Readers if you're like me and can't wait until March 31st for another installment from George R.R. Martin, pick up the Farseer and Tawny Man Trilogies for a good and fanciful adventure. So long Fitz.
B008JIWNYG|4.0|Loved the start to green lantern. It was really fun to see the progression of sidestep. This is a must read for green lantern fans
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Loved it!!  Great movie!!  Great story and many great lines in this one.  An all time favorite.  If you've never seen it I highly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless<br /><br />by Colleen Hoover<br /><br />My rating: 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />Disclaimer: You may vomit from this post because I'm going to get all fan girl sappy on you.<br /><br />THERE ARE NO SPOILERS, but I did put a few lines from the book that won't spoil your read. You may even read the lines and be like, \\"What's the big deal? I'm not impressed.\\" I felt that way too when I read these same lines in other places, but trust me. . .you will cry when you read them in the book.<br /><br />SKY and HOLDEN Wow!<br /><br />This book is what books are suppose to be. This book is more than romance or coming of age or the typical hyped up amazon bestseller that does well because there are a lot of crazy people who are buying a bad book. PLEASE BELIEVE THE HYPE ON THIS ONE, BABY! I would never guide you on the wrong path.<br /><br />This book is THE book to start your 2013!<br /><br />It's about the impact others can make in your life. Even a child to another child.<br /><br />\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Finally a book with a lot of hype that DESERVES all of the HYPE. I mean there have been some books that people have raved about that were pure crap. So I walked into Hopeless feeling. . .well. . .Hopeless.<br /><br />And you all know me well. I mean I bitch and bitch and bitch about Bestsellers that are crap and here comes this book that tears my damn chest a part, grips my beating organ in its fingers, and won't freaking let go...and if that's not sick enough...it makes me laugh and at times arouses me...as its killing me from the inside!<br /><br />So I'm reading the book. First three chapters are cool, nothing mind-blowing. The main character is fine. I found the prologue to be unnecessary. I'm thinking to myself that I'll give it two more chapters and then I'll DNF it for something better.<br /><br />OH MYGOD! I'm so glad I stuck to five chapters because then Holder walked into my life. . .I mean Sky's life. So I'm reading and loving it. I'm thinking okay.<br /><br />This is a great New Adult Contemporary Romance. But stupid me had no idea that this is a goddamn Mystery and Psychological Thriller!<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />I mean. I'm a writer. I love my books. I got fans. I'm secure within myself. And then this heiffer Colleen Hoover comes along and makes me want to be a BETTER WRITER! Damn you! She makes me want to revise more, add more, feel more, cry more! I hate you!<br /><br />Okay back to the book.<br /><br />\\"F#%k all the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers,\\" Holder said.<br /><br />Holder said that, but dear god this is the BEST FIRST KISS I've ever read! I may go to my hometown and smack the crap out of the guy who gave me my first kiss. Sure his wife and kids may be taken aback, but if I read them all the passages of the first kiss, then they'll get it.<br /><br />\\"Not everyone gets a happily every after. Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />I do wish that someone had told me that this book would stay in my mind for a long time, that I would fall in love with these characters and then cry when they cry, and hurt when they've been inflicted with pain, and rejoice when they've figured out a way to heal, because in the end there is some healing. It's not a Disney ending, but it made me feel better about saying goodbye to Holden and Sky.
B008M87GJK|1.0|This is crummy of the BBC so I quite agree with your comment!<br /><br />\\"You flashed an advert on my kindle suggesting I download this free app. When I tried to do so I received a message telling me the app is unavailable to me due to \\"geographical restrictions\\". Why bloody bother showing it to me then? Bah.\\"
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I thought it was a lot of coolness,goodness for any other way of the most popular game it is! Right
B00632HWOG|1.0|however the recent upgrade turned it into crap. If I did not rely on yahoo for email I would delete this app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  I play it in bed to calm my mind.  It can be a little challenging in the later levels but easy enough that it doesn't get too frustrating.  My kids love it too.  Probably about age 6 and up could do it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is damn good I cant stop playing this damn game so you better damn well get this damn game it is damn good!!!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Definitely a pleasant surprise. I can see why this caught hold in South Africa.  Listened to it twice in a row while driving.  It really grew on me.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|It's a remastered digital recording of one of the best efforts of Robert and the gang ever made. How can you go wrong?
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Listened to this while driving on a trip.  A lot better than I expected.  Will take a while to figure out all the meaning but defiinitely will listen to this a fair bit going forward

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I am a huuuuuge fan of Les Miz and this met every expectation I had, everyone is so talented (well except Nick Jonas, but that's bby personal taste.) Everyone needs to buy this. NOW.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|i am very close to the end of story. i enjoyed a lot on this game and its worth to pay to play entire game.
B004Y042N8|3.0|This app is fun, but I don't usually just play it for fun. It's good for challenges and taking up some time, so it is worth getting. I got this app from the free app a day app, and figured since it was free I'd get it and see. After testing it out, I decided to keep it. I think you would probably keep this app, too.
B0060D16VI|5.0|Inspiried me to cook, go into the hospitality business, keeps you up when you're down and makes you really think!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have had this app for two days, and I already love it as much as temple run one!!!! If you have played temple run, you will really love this game. It is free, too, and everyone will like it. Totally get this game!!!!!!!!!
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twin Peaks was a terrific series, a fun and exciting adventure of imagination run wild. If you say you &#34;understand&#34; the show, I would tend to doubt it, only the minds of David Lynch and Mark Frost &#34;understand&#34; this series, we're just along for the very wild ride. Coming to the end of the last disc, I was so let down--I really wanted the story to go on--what happened to FBI Agent Dale Cooper, did Bob really take him over, and where can I get that great cup of joe and perfect slice of pie?
B007TXN4TK|3.0|this is real good for kids, but not for adults.I tried it for myself, but it is not for me.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I collect dvds of the multitudiness versions of this timeless classic, but always return to the original written story for a quick fix of the true meaning of Christmas (as opposed to, say, The Flintstones Christmas Carol?). A new-found belief in the basic goodness of humanity turns a bitter, lonely miser into a real human being, capable of giving and receiving love. What a theme!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is good but the horse life adventures game is better to me so go out there and try the it's awesome! Thanks bye!
B0083H6AQA|4.0|This film was beautifully and lovingly photographed and sucessfully evoked the era. That said, the story was difficult for me to follow not having read the novel first. Robert Pattinson was every bit as beautiful as the story required yet it was hard to believe his baser instincts. He seemed like a nice guy, and the character wasn't really a very nice guy. I recommend it for the pleasure of seeing Pattinson, but watch the old George Sanders film for the story.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was so informative. It exposed the truth about wheat. I was so shocked and surprised to learn about the changes in the way wheat is being grown. It makes sense. A very good book... I'd recommend this one to EVERYONE who eats wheat. (we no longer eat wheat, after reading this book)

B003VDY7XE|3.0|When I first started watching Haven, i couldn't wait til the next episode. Now I'm kind of over it. It feels repetitive. The character's aren't that great (although I do love Duke ... he is what saves the show). Personally, I wouldn't waste my money again, I would prob just watch on netflix or hulu...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game Is really amazing! You really have to use your mind for it. I really hope you get this.
B000J103YI|5.0|Awesome performances by the whole cast!  I remember seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and it got a standing ovation.
0345803485|1.0|I had to see what all the hoopla was about.  I grew up on Anne Rice and Rosemary Rodgers -- so to me the sex was positively tame and boring.  The cliches were rampant -- the repetitiveness was mind-numbing -- the blushing, the lip biting, the inner goddess -- the \\"crap\\" variations.  Really?  And who says \\"double crap\\" anyway?  The characters were dull and one-dimensional.  Erotica is different to eveyone, but if you made it to the end of the book, I'm sure you remembered the scene where he told her to bend over so he could remove the \\"blue string\\" and dispose of it in the toilet -- and then a bit later they proceeeded to have casual relationship talk while he stood there naked with her blood all over him.  WTF?  And then the author tried to compare Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess\\" to Ana and Christian Grey to Angel Clare.  In the name of Thomas Hardy, I am highly offended.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Definitely understand it better now that I read it for the second time. Now to the next one.

B00AB0AR2U|3.0|The story is good and Mil is as good as usual. But the zombies have become more like aliens than zombies.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book  is  undeniably a great love story that warms your heart. It is very entertaining and full of rich and gratifying literature for the soul.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|I'm a fan of racing in general, but have never followed the sport closely.  Watching the movie gave me the sense of an untold story that most any fan of sports can enjoy, regardless if its racing or not.  Well worth the watch to learn the story of this amazing athlete.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|If you like Cut the Rope and Where's My Water, this is along the same lines and just as enjoyable.  It's fun and also makes my son unknowingly use physics strategies to get the ducks!  I find myself playing way too long because I just have to conquer the next level......just ONE more......okay, ONE more......one more and that's it.......(an hour later).  Worth all 99&cent;!

0062081527|5.0|Loved this book when I first read it years ago and still find it a page turner and abook that is hard to put down
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is an AWESOME game.  You can build towers or houses, fight monsters, and play with friends in your world. The only bad thing is that when i try to let others into my world on my kindle fire, the server doesn't &quot;see&quot; it and they cant join. Otherwise, i would recommend it to everyone!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Theres more obstacles. My favourite part is the rope and having the rope. This game kills time! :)
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I just finished watching season 2 last night on FX.  I believe that the season finale was one of the best written and most beautifully-shot episodes of any television series that I've ever seen.  This season, like season 1, is fantastic.  The show keeps you guessing throughout.  Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy, Dylan McDermott, Evan Peters, and Lily Rabe all return for season 2, playing different characters than those they portrayed in season 1.  They all shine in their roles.  I highly recommend watching this show!
B005651RDS|4.0|A story about the rebel fighting in Bouganville as told by a village girl. It is an insight into village life on a small tropical island and the consequences of the fighting. It was, on the whole, a very pleasant and gentle story, except of course for the fighting, which was very descriptive and violent.  There were 2 passages I found boring, but they were relatively short and can be skipped over.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|recomend it to everyone who'd predict the future:):):)it's one of my favorite I love the action and the story !
B0044XV3R8|5.0|this is better than the one disc movies beacuse it has the extra things that were taken out of the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I  loved part two of this trilogy.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book.  I couldn't put Catching Fire down for very long.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|dictionary- merriam-webster; I use this all the time and it help with my computer so I can add word to the computers words.
B003KIMOIK|4.0|A good test of a movie is if the critics liked it.  If they pan it, it is generally a good show.<br /><br />City Heat does not take itself seriously.  It was shot to be entertainment.  There is no great social commentary.  It was written to entertain and if you permit yourself to sit back and enjoy, it does just that.  It is not the greatest film ever made by any of the principals, but it is a fun and enjoyable movie.  Something that is needed by all from time to time.<br /><br />Quit trying to be a film critic, and enjoy the show.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run I down loaded for the kids and they really like playing it. I do not play it at all
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An amazing story, written from the heart. I couldn't put it down...read the whole book in a weekend. Inspiring on 2 levels: an authentic story of heartache, loss and finding one's soul. I also loved the Hiking experience, it got me out the door and joining a local hiking group.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is great so I can down load music on to my kindle fire and listen any time I want
B0063GORYU|5.0|The thing I love about this game is that you can play at different levels of expertise.  If I get frustrated at the higher level, I can play at the beginner level and know that I haven't lost me ability to win!
B00632HWOG|5.0|this is nice so I can check my e-mail and do not have to use my computer to do it thisd is great
B002M2T1UO|5.0|i bought this as a gift for my son and i rated this as he had never saw this show before...i bought it because i thought he had and he said it was a great series and i asked him if he would recommend it to me and he said yes mom you would love it too..my son is very straightforward and would not lie about anything if he did not like it....and i had several who had seen it to begin with tell me it was a great show..so worth the money
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is awesome but it needs way more time it's only 5 minutes I would but the game but no money in my account
0393064476|5.0|I have been listening to the narrated version of this wonderful book. I frequently go back, listen again, revel in the architecture of the author's language, marvel at the research, thoroughly enjoy and marvel at their joined forces.  The book is a delight, serious and funny.  Dizzying.<br />I listen, enchanted, something akin to Once Upon A Time days.<br />Ah, and then there is the narrator himself:  just brilliant, Edoardo Ballerini.<br /><br />I walk while listening to recorded books.<br />It is in the low twenties today, snowed yesterday.<br />I listened to \\"The Swerve\\" as I shoveled my endless driveway, then walked for the next hour...enthralled.<br />Enough said.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Was looking for a camera app.  That was simple and user friendly.  This one is both.  Very happy with it
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The characters behaviour was unbelievable and annoying, I didn't even finish this book. Not a good read. Not recommended. Don't waste your time.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|don't get in it is a wast of time it asked you if you wont to buy it. not a good game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like this app it like having a real horse but just not really worrying about it like in real life
B00280LYIC|4.0|I love this book, but it's a little sad when Annabeth wipes a tear from her cheek when Cerberus whines in the distance.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I brought this to read as everyone was raving about it, i was hooked in the first couple of pages and couldnt work out why as it is not the book i would normally read but i was hooked and couldnt put it down then when i finished it i had to buy the next two.<br />No one seen much of me for a whole week and a half as i was totally addicted to reading these books!!<br /><br />fantabulous boks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and so does my 3 year old grandson.  We play it all the time.  It is challenging to see how far you can get.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I grew up around horses but was forced to move from them this make me think of them
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is really fun but the bad part is that you have to pay to play multiplayer so don't go play multiplayer thinking it is free.
B00932AA5G|5.0|I love Jo Nesbo's novels, so when I saw this was based on one of his books, I was excited to see it. The action never stops, and the twists and turns are very unexpected. If you liked \\"Fargo,\\" you will love this!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed it. I think it's meant for a younger group, but it took me back to my youth.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|This is a fabulous concert. I disagree with the comments saying that some of the musicianship seems tired. Simon Phillips and Anthony Jackson are on spring chickens, that's for sure, but there is no lack of energy. Musicians don't need to be jumping all over the place to be good. I thought the level of musicianship was excellent all around, and Hiromi as usual is fantastic on the keyboard.<br /><br />The sonics are excellent. The DVD has both stereo PCM and Dolby 5.1 tracks. I preferred the latter because it gave me more of a sense of the auditorium but both sound great. The music is focused in the front - no weird stuff like instruments coming out of the surround or rear speakers.<br /><br />The video is excellent as well.  I thought it was tastefully done, each shot spending enough time on the performer to allow us to focus on what they are doing rather than skipping back and forth among the three or trying to give us fancy viewing angles.<br /><br />I'm very happy I purchased this DVD. Everything about it is first rate.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book, sucks you in and makes you not want to put it down. The whole concept was intriguing and I would suggest this book for anyone of any age.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put this down!  Gideon's mysterious behavior to protect Eva keeps you wanting more, I can't wait until May to read more!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down once I started. The imagery and storyline are riveting,and I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, entertaining read!
B005HSL626|5.0|I have had this game for five years and nothing has been wrong this app is awesome I would recomement this app for everyone listen to me I doont care what anyone else says so get it u will love it trust me
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A disturbing book in many ways.  Grissom describes the lives of slaves on a southern plantation.  It is very touching in places and uncomfortable in others.  Read it for a book club and pretty much everyone found it fascinating and disturbing.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Such a great album! I love every single song! Lana Del Rey is so different for any other artist, it is so refreshing! Love her!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS GAME IS MORE FUN AND ADDICTING THAN THE ORIGINAL! The graphics have improved and scenic. The zip lines and mine cart are a nice choice to change up the monotony of just running everywhere. The new additions of powerups and upgrades are cool and useful. And I love that I can be a girl. GET THIS GAME!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a bad game I like the computer version bet this is hard to control and lags. If u Don't have very much pations I would not buy this app their is better free games out there just like this one. LOLZ
034580404X|5.0|hope she writes alot more books, these were very good and alot of fun to read as well.  Thank you for your hard work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|YOU HAVE. 2 GET. THIS APP. U WILL LOVE IT. totally. 4 animal lovers the best app yet forever can't. beat it
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|boring to me and even tho willis was in it, just didn't make alot of sense to me just alot of violence
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is a great way to pass time if you sit around bored very often I would get it!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B006BDHAX0|5.0|_great game I really enjoy playing. nice that I don't have all the repeats like the other versions have!<br />-
B003JTHXOK|5.0|save haven...... could not stop reading..............amazing..... have to see movie for sure.....loved it!!!! a must read for  all!!!!! cant wait for next book
B007IXWKUK|5.0|it is better than the first one i dont know what else to say it is a very good book
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|love the game but the free one was too short. But I still recommend it. Mysterious. The paid version is too expensive.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read many NDE books, but none that was written by a doctor. I loved it, because most doctors only believe in science.  Not their fault though, that's just what they were taught. Their brains are on overload and need to stay in the present in order to care for their patients. I wished I lived in VA, I would hire Dr. Alexander as my Neurologist.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was very challenging yet really fun!!!!! I love how even if you finish the game part, you can still play the time trials. It is a very good waiting room game. I had heard of this game from my friends who also have it on their iPod touch. (I'm on a kindle fire) My only concern is that an add will pop up out of no where at usually 1 second left! (time trials) That is the only bad thing about this though! And it was free! Great game!!! :D
B0052UYJDC|4.0|4<br /><br />Really good ideas.  Hope to use most of them.  My problem is with family memories since I am the last of the clan.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved this book!!  The story is wonderful, one of determination and struggle and how Cheryl was able to get through it all on the trail.  Made me want to hike the PCT myself!
B0084LQHN6|5.0|Hi-energy music, racy and she looks good eneough to eat. Yummy her and yummy music. Would definitely recommend it to anyone that like dance music, rap, or R & B.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is great!  After I read the first 1-5 books of Wool I had to go on to First and Second Shift of the Legacy Series.  The story is intriguing and suspenseful, and kept me interested the whole time.  Great characters and plot!  Cant complain about a single thing except I wish it was longer!!  Howey leaves you wanting more!
0765325950|4.0|I had a great time reading this book.  As everyone who has been reading the series for 20 years, I wish more scenes were flushed out -- moiraine meeting siuan/lan and everyone else, moiraine doing more cool things, egwene marrying gawyn, Arthur hawkwing talking with tuon, the full flushing out of what happens afterward, etc.  But I am satisfied with what happens and glad that sanderson finished the series
B009YP9L7U|4.0|easy to get into light romance with sexual references haven't finished it yet but half way there and still interesting
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another great Reacher story. All the classic elements and references to the usual characters. One nit though, and this from an army brat and former infantryman; army \\"bases\\" are called \\"posts.\\" Or at least they were back in the 20th century.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first got this app, I was kinda leery. I was so addicted. The only thing I didn't love about this app is that you have to pay to  some new players. They can get to be really high at some points. You should get it even though I said some bad stuff about it.
0525953728|5.0|It was the number one thing on my husband's Christmas list and he was so excited to receive it.  Not yet read, but with vacation coming soon will get more opportunities to take a look at it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book, any adult female should read this if you like romace type books, yes it might have some misused words but still love it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Inspired me to not only strengthen my walk with the Lord, but to continue to strengthen my already solid and amazing relationship with my wife and children..one of the most inspiring books ever..
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book, any adult female should read this if you like romace type books, yes it might have some misused words but still love it.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|The fourth installment of the Ice Age series is a throw back to the first film by separating Manny, Sid, and Diego from Manny's wife & daughter.  A new character, Granny (Sid's grandma), pops in and out of their adventure purely for humor purposes. While on an iceberg trying to get back to Manny's family, they bump into a group of insane pirates who want to take Manny captive.<br />Overall, it's a cute film kids will love (with a heartwarming lesson for all), but as a fan of the original, the jokes fall flat at times and the production design isn't as creative. Worth a rental but I wouldn't buy it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|don't care for this game at all, my daughter put in on my kindle fire thinking I might like it
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|No one goes into a Resident Evil flick thinking, &#34;Oh boy! This will be an amazing cinematic experience!&#34;  I think we can all agree that it takes greatly lowered expectations to even enjoy the films. But what the Resident Evil films lack in depth, thematics, and acting, they make up for in over-the-top action, CGI creatures, and Milla Jovovich wearing a skintight body suit.<br /><br />However, even Milla's almost naked bandaged body cannot redeem Resident Evil: Retribution. From the start, her monotone narration set a sleepy tone that confused me for the rest of the film. What happened? Where are we? Who are these people? What are they doing? What happened to the story? Why do I care?!  The movie was blur, leaving an &#34;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#34; blank spot in my memory. It all looks familiar, feels familiar, yet I remember nothing.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My wife and I are fans of the show.  When I received the offer from Amazon it was too good to pass up.  The local PBS station doesn't broadcast in HD, so these Bluray DVDs let us watch a much better picture on our HDTV.<br /><br />Now we are hoping the third (and supposedly last) season makes it to Bluray DVD as well
B009SQRL4U|2.0|My wife and I wanted to like Arthur Christmas, but the movie lacked the heart that all great Christmas movies have. None of the Santas were likable, in fact they were downright selfish. It could be hard to explain to a child why 3 of the Santas didn't care about missing one child at Christmas.<br /><br />The jokes aren't funny, the voice acting is so-so, and the story is a bit ridiculous. Pass on this one and watch &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; for the umpteenth time instead.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Modernized my HTPC system with this chip in a Gigabyte F2A85X-UP4. Previous setup was an old Q6600 in an ASUS P5W-DH.<br /><br />Good on power usage and so far extremely stable. The integrated GPU is sufficient for HTPCs or casual use desktops; no PCIe GPU means less heat, power use, and noise (if not using passive cooling).
B00A77II0U|5.0|What a great game for kindle fire hd! Hours of entertainment, great story and graphics.  Lots of hidden object games, and not too many puzzles.  None of that going back and forth to locations multiple times.  Hint button  was very good, and if you got really stuck the strategy guide would bail you out.  I would highly recommend this game!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it great features my sister loves it to get it very good time killer it entertains me a lot
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I LOVE it! Make more games , whoever you are! I would really appreciate it if you did!<br />this is SO EPIC:)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I was getting only 3-4 hours of sleep due to health reasons.  After starting to use this, it has helped me to relax and I am currently getting around 6 hours of sleep.  A great product, with alot of choices.  I love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE!!!!!!!! Could u make more???? PLEEEEEEEAAAAAASSSS?????????? I love prize claw, too! So could u make more games like it???
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy John Grisham's books. I eagerly look forward to each new book.  The Racketeer is a great read, with twists and surprises right to the end!
B005C6HGSG|5.0|True to Supernatural's cameo-turned-main-player &#34;Bobby Singer,&#34; played by Jim Beaver, the voice throughout the book is as familiar as those old show scripts; quirky, brash, self-righteous loner, master of old lore father figure to Sam and Dean, David Reed has successfully resurrected him in all his glory. Frankly, I miss his character, and think the show suffers without him. This is a fun read for all ages. Think of it as a kind of post modern Grimm's Fairy Tales.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed reading. Will be reading last book very soon! I knew somehow katniss and peers would survive but really had no idea how! Great book
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love and are currently addicted to this game! I can't get enough of it! I just need to figure out how to walk without getting blown up by creepers...
B007THA4FI|4.0|It's no Harry Potter, make no mistake.  Cut her a break and let her be the fantastic story teller that she is.  As with prior books you can identify with her characters even if they are nothing like you.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I had pretty much lost interest in Angry Birds games through Seasons and Rio and still haven't completed Space, but when I played a couple of rounds of Star Wars on a friend's device, I decided to get it. I am enjoying it as much as the original Angry Birds, but for the rude marketing ploys for people who want to buy their way in to a new level. As far as I can tell, you can achieve three stars on any level without an additional purchase, but the whole idea of tendering bribe money to the manufacturer to get there faster and with less work disgusts me. Come on, people! This is a game. It's meant to entertain you, and although it may take a while to get there, your feeling of accomplishment will be much greater if you don't \\"cheat\\" by buying your way to fame. Put aside your desires for instant gratification and take the game for what it is: a pastime. FYI, the roots of that word are \\"pass\\" and \\"time.\\" Give that a bit of thought before you buy a \\"cheat.\\"
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack has lots of pockets, and multi compartments for lenses.  Some people might not like that it has Amazon branding, but that's what I like about it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thought all the acting great.  The story was interesting and kept my interest.  Can't wait to watch Season 3.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Title pretty much says everything. It gets boring after a while. But not bad for free.You get a horse and compete with it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great show, keeps you guessing at every turn... Highly recommended. Season 1 was amazing as well.  Sexy horror, this will keep you on your toes.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I guess the title of this review could be enough to describe the quality of the music recorded in this album. Laurie is an amazing artist, he plays amazingly well, plays many kinds of instruments, has recorded this great blues album, has written books (but I have never read them), etc. His taste in music is undoubtably great. Highly reccomended for blues lovers.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|A wonderful movie that I enjoyed seeing a second time. Historical, dramatic and uplifting. Great performances by all. My Dad remembers hearing the speech as a teen at the onset of the war, making it all the more poignant.
B000005J56|4.0|Buena Vista Social Club is a great band. But I believe that the choices of songs to be recorded could have been better. Although, the first song is the worldwide known Chan Chan, which is really great. I guess the CD is already worthwhile only because of this first song.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Paul Tough is brilliant! Love his investigative summary! Would share this with all who have an interest in the inequalities found in America's education system.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read Stephen King, but I love time travel, so I picked it up and never put it down!  It was fasinating, (almost ) believable, totally entertaining and had a clever, satisfying ending!  I recommend it to everyone-especially those who clearly remember the Kennedy assassination!  This was a fun and cleverly written novel!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|The gameplay for this is a lot of fun. It's not too tricky, but it's good for light play and definitely would be fun for kids. I really loved the cute animations and the art style was very charming. I can't wait to see what future levels they will come out with.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It crashes every time I try to open the game! I have the oldest version of the kindle fire. Please try to fix it because I really love this game!
B009ARMS1I|1.0|instead of writing their own arrangements for the show. We shouldn't let this slide. Please help take action again Fox for being head handed and rubbing it in Jonathan Coultrain's face.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Don't let the fact that the main characters are teenagers turn you away from this book; it is not a novel just for kids. This is one of the best books that I have read in a long while. It is a bittersweet story about life and love. Read it and be prepared to laugh, cry, and love these characters....it will leave you wanting more.
B001MSMUH0|4.0|This is a truly inspiring book.  I love the conversational writing style and all the stories.  This book is similar to others I have read about finding your mission/passion and having a fulfilled life rather than following the socially standardized way of living.  But this one is different in that it explains how to do it in a way that seems natural and allows me to think \\"hey, I can do that\\".
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I don't think the stand works so great.  The cover is ok but it would have been nice if it had a zipper.  I would spend more to get one with a zipper next time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Since installing this game, I have not been able to put it down! Great graphics and excellent yet easy gameplay make this a hit on so many levels.  Works beautifully on the Fire HD.  I recommend this for just about anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|WHAT can I say? This game is SO fun! Usually I don't like games like this. I am more of a diner dash type game player,but I kept seeing this high on the recommended list for my Kindle Fire HD. I tried temple run,but didnt really care for it(I know I am one of the few who doesn't) but I was in the mood to try something different,so I downloaded Subway Surfers..I honestly couldn't stop playing! Very addicting,the graphics are awesome,game play is smooth and you aren't pestred with nag screens to buy stuff with real money (although you can and there are some cool stuff to buy)but you can purchase stuff with the coins you snag while running. Bottom line,if you liked temple run,and even if you didn't,I would definitely recommend everyone to try this one. I am glad I did.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Never thought I would get hooked on any theatrical series or soap opera. I am mesmerized and hopelessly addicted.<br />Cast of characters, plot, period costumes and scenery are all amazing.<br /> It has a life of its own and is taken over m'Lady's and mine!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very good and funny. I really enjoyed it. It is an easy read and great for non readers
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|If you like Family Guy you'll like Ted. I don't so I didn't think it was very good.  Ted is basically Peter Griffin.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|If you enjoyed the last album from Mumford, you will enjoy this one as well. Excellent consistent sound from these guys.
075669812X|5.0|This was the perfect gift to a young Lego enthusiast.Especially with the lego mini figure that was included with the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is fun for a visually-oriented person like me. Enjoy finding craft ideas-art images-Pudsey the dog-all in visual format. Links to source web sites help me find additional information if I want it. Well-organized format allows quick navigation. No getting over-whelmed by stupid comments on Pinterest!
0756697875|5.0|This book was the perfect gift for a young boy who lives and breathes legos.The mini figure was so cute.
B005LAIISA|5.0|It was a gift for my husband, he loves these ice age movies. Grandkids got him started on them. It was in new condition and played perfect. Arrived earlier than I expected.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|if you love will ferrell, you will love this movie. he's hilarious in it and its a great christmas movie to see with your family. I feel like the younger generation will laugh at will ferrell's weirdness and the older generation will enjoy the heartwarming message :) (or at least thats what happened with i watched it with my grandpa and mom)
B00122PUL4|4.0|Change of pace. I enjoyed it better than with Ozzie.  Maybe becuz the subject matter was different and that Dio is a better singer
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this was a gift for my grandson at christmas he liked very much especally the digital copy for his computer, and dvd for his home tv
B000PAAH3K|3.0|I found the book somewhat boring and repetitive.  There were parts, particular the police reactions, interestering but the first half seemed very repetitive.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|great movie would recommend, actors well played their part, scenery fantastic, hoping for a sequel , blu ray are great
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This dictionary is very important for a kindle fire because of the high price of a nice dictionary these days
0345350499|5.0|I originally bought this as a gift for my little sister (15). I opened it to get a feel for what it was like, and the next thing I knew I was halfway through and couldn't put it down! Bradley weaves an intricate web of characters and plot lines, and puts a whole new twist on the Arthurian legend.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Watched them on YouTube and really liked their pieces. Bought this to support their music! I love the compilation =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book left me wanting to read more after every chapter!<br />LOVED the book! CA<br />CAN'T WAIT  TO READ THE NEXT  BOOK!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I picked this book up at the insistence of a friend. To preserve the friendship I have never mentioned it again as I don't trust myself to provide a mild mannered review. The key themes of the plot - the transformation of a young college graduate into the submissive of a wealthy older man, while not to my taste were not the reason that I had to stop reading this book half way through. It was the appalling writing. I cannot fathom why it was not given a proper edit before publication. Terrible sentence structure and dialogue prevails and the word \\"whoa\\" appears far many more times than it should.<br /><br />Descriptions of characters are also often uncreative with the same phrases used over and over and over and (just when you thought it couldn't be possible) over again. For instance, whenever key protagonist Christian Grey is thoughtful, bored, angry or even just neutral he always has his head \\"cocked to one side.\\"<br /><br />Personally this book wasn't my thing. I'm not into the raunchy read and I found the implications that some of the key themes of the book had for modern feminism slightly off putting. But for this review, the 1 star was almost entirely earned by the terrible writing.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|Honestly, I didn't like the song order, but whatever. What a great release by Helloween! They are so consistent and just keep bringing it with each new release. Super good stuff! Amazing! Love it!
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|suitable for wide span of ages, adults included... beautifully made. One of my favorite &#34;kid&#34; movies of all time! watch it
B00633W614|5.0|Ready for the next in &#34;The Clifton Chronicles&#34; . Thank you Amazon for pre-order. I resisted the first book for too long, Buy them now.
B000002L1L|4.0|Let me make this plain and clear.  This is a classic Mach II Deep Purple CD.  That being said, if you like In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Who Do We Think We Are?, Perfect Strangers and House of the Blue Light then you will LOVE this CD.  The lyrics are clever, the guitar is classic Blackmore and the rhythm section of Paice, Lord and Glover is as solid as ever.  The production is crisp and what more do you need?  Never get tired of listening to Anya, Twist in The Tale,  Ramshackle Man and Nasty Piece of Work.  Nothing wrong with the other tracks *(except One Man's Meat) either.  With the garbage that passes as rock these days you owe it to yourself to hear some \\"real\\" rock Gods.  Deep Purple Mach II are among the best.  I promise you won't be disappointed.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Be forewarned: This is often violent, although there is a good reason for that, given all the graft and corruption going on in this story of corrupt cops and criminals in 1950 L.A.  Pearce, Spacey, DeVito, Cromwell, Crowe and the others give superb performances as people who clash with one another while getting tangled in a web of deceit that stretches throughout the LAPD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the book so much the ending there really is a district thirteen. Peers might b  in the capitol bein  tortured and Katniss is in district thirteen with survivors of district twelve. Amazed.<br />Thalia Chapman
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game its just it wont open a few times I play it they need to fix it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again.  I love the music and the movie.  Would recommend this for anyone.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good story, nice graphics. I expected a much longer game for the price. I finished the entire game in a day..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had never seen Downton Abbey before.  This last Christmas my granddaughter told me all about it.  I had to purchase and watch all episodes on my Kindle Fire.  Love this series.  Could watch it again and again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read more than 30+ books in the last year. This one was unexpected and one of the best.  I've read some really hardcore erotica to simple love stories.  This one is somewhere in between but in a good way.  You begin to feel for the two characters, Sky and Holder.  The story was so much more than I expected and once I started it I had to finished. The characters are young but it's not a teen romance it's so much more than that. Definitely worth it and I promise you won't regret buying it. You will keep a part of this book with you forever!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My daughter and I purchased this to listen to in the car driving from Seattle to Idaho Falls.  It was really a good book and kept me awake the whole driving time.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this temerity run is good but its glichty and e wry time I would have a bad run it would delete my coins! the app is ok.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I ordered this for a granddaughter for Christmas.  She was thrilled to receive it and the whole family enjoyed watching it.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Thoroughly liked the story, anything with JC, Jack Ryan n Jr, Ding n the others, makes a good yarn and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good read
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I ordered these for my grandson for Christmas and he was very excited to receive it.  Great movies for all the grandsons to watch.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I'm just writing this review because I'm supposed to get the sequel for free if I write a review. The game was pretty fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Character development is superb. Plotline is fast paced and engaging. Environmental description really brings you into the story.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next book in the series. Excellent job Ms. Collins.
B008MZPVP4|4.0|1 SEAT BECAUSE IT'S DOWN. 3 STARS FOR THE ALBUM ITSELF. PHIL'S VOCALS AREN'T SO GREAT. DOWN NOLA AND DOWN II STILL THE BEST!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I had the great pleasure of meeting Ian Rankin several years ago at a Bouchercon.  I was expecting at best a brief nod after I told him how much enjoyed his books but instead he said, \\"Oh, sit doon, sit doon\\" and we actually had a chance to talk. So I may be a bit biased in favor of his books.<br />  This book marks the return of John Rebus who is now working on cold cases but manages to get himself involved in a current case because a recent disppearance of a woman seems  to be part of a pattern in which his cold case figures.  Rebus displays all his usual behaviors and traits: too much drinking, too much smoking, and the eating of too much fast food. He still loves music and the local pub.<br />  This book is also about how policing has changed over the years. Rebus has always worked best following his own hunches and while  he learns to respect the technology that makes some of the job easier, the current politics don't suit him. In fact it would be fair to say that suits don't suit him be they bosses or the clothes he wears.<br />  During the course of the book, it emerges that during an Internal Affairs investigation from several years back he has been described as a maverick and the writer of the report notes: \\"We need ONE of those.\\" It's clear that current management have trouble tolerating even one. But Rebus is just so good at what he does, he can't be totally ignored. I hope he keeps coming back.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is a great read. David Baldacci continually writes books that grip your attention and which you can't put down.
078322611X|5.0|A story of believing absolutely in something, despite the rational arguements of your detractors.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  A wonderful story of faith, love, hope and being true to yourself.
B009186JNO|4.0|Great chance to see the Stones when they were just on the ascendancy. Ardent fans will love the clean pressing of a movie that most of us have only seen as a bad print in an art house movie theater. I don't think casual fans will care for it, though, as it documents only the early songs, and even that takes only a part of the overall film.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|Gentle, charming and droll humour.  No slapstick, no real laugh out loud funnies but definitely 'feel good' without the scmaltz.  The premise of the story is ridiculous but true - an example of making your private dreams come true (if you have the money and can buy the know how!)  Personally, I think Ewan McGregor and Kristin Scott Thomas stole the show in this one.  Worth watching just to see KST as a driven, ignorant government emissary.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|A great album from one of (if not the) greatest blues performers ever. This is the real deal, and the CD sound is really quite wonderful (the vinyl is better, of course) especially at the reduced price. A can't miss purchase!
B0099114WO|4.0|OMG! This cuts so close to the bone of many long term marriages I know.  If you want a wake up a call, this offers it with humour and dignity.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I think that Michael Connelly is a gifted writer....and so far (cross my fingers none of his books have disappointed me).  I have to say as far as developing a perfectly flawed, seemingly SOOOO real character, he nailed it with Harry Bosch.  Like Patterson with Alex Cross or Coben with Myron Bollitar.<br />I pre-ordered this book because I have read EVERYTHING he has written.  I wasn't disappointed!!! I can't wait till the next one!<br /><br />HeyJude118
0767836286|4.0|Tim Robbins and Jeff<br />Bridges are fabulous in this movie of 'sleeper cells,' that prior to 2000 would have seemed nothing more than a fantastical story - but now we know different .  Joan Cusack as Tim Robbins wife is equally scary and plays her part to perfection.  My partner and I were playing the 'yes they are / no their not,' game as we watched it, not really being sure of the intent of anyone until the mind blowing conclusion.  (Pun intended.)
B003UGLCIA|5.0|I heard of The Exorcist which it was mention through Beetlejuice. And after I sat down and watch it, I now became a fan of this movie. William Peter Blatty wrote an excellent novel, and William Friedkin chose the right film to direct. Horror fans should give this a chance, and hope to make this movies one of their favorites in their list of favorite horror movies.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book again, and I especially love that it was a free book. This is a great choice for just about any reader.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I never really intended to watch this musical cause it reminds me for my ex-girlfriend. This was her favorite. But when the 2012 film version was coming out, I decided to see it, and now I love this musical. But not as much as I love The Phantom of the Opera. I know that they are different shows, but they are both classic shows, and they should be praised equally.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Wow, I really got alot out of this book. I really wish I had read this book about 10 years ago. I recomend this book for anyone who wants to get a little financial perspective.

B00005M2CP|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase. They arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and my husband was more then pleased with his gift. The price was more the acceptable. The one other place I did find them used they wanted triple the price I paid thru Amazon.<br />GREAT JOB!!!!<br />I had been searching for months for this Collection when finally I tried Amazon, I will no longer look anywhere else for movies or books that are not available in bookstores. I will be seeking books on CD's next. I hope I won't be disappointed.

B00AYSUOBS|4.0|Robbie Williams is great at churning out a pop album, and \\"Take The Crown\\" is no exception. The album's lead single \\"Candy\\" is a lively song about a girl who \\"thinks she's made of candy.\\" The background music and Robbie's powerful voice make the song one of the highlights of the album (no surprise it did well on the radio charts either). The album is also filled with similar gems: \\"Be A Boy\\" and \\"All That I Want.\\" Fans of Robbie will be satisfied, though I don't expect this will attract many new fans. It's a lighter album, with Robbie's signature pop/rock mix. While it's not a ballady album like some of his previous work, it's still a good album in its own right.<br /><br />A solid 4 stars.<br /><br />Edit: I was pleased to see \\"Be A Boy\\" chosen as the next single. It is definitely the best song on the album.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|College Hoover has done it again. This book captured my heart and soul by the characters and storyline. I felt like was there as a character in the story looking in. I loved the poetry that colleen intertwined throughout the story giving it a unique feature. I loved the lessons that we taught throughout the book. This book took me to a different world from start finish. I was touched and enlightened by this story
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|All I gotta say is that this game should be 99 cents because of the graphics. I've waited for this game only to be disappointed. Please change price if you want more customers. Now modern combat is worth the 7 dollars.
0385333846|5.0|This book is bizarre,  but very interesting.  It tells the life of a man who has been taught to time travel to different points in his life, as he experiences life.  Is he insane or did the aliens really abduct him and teach him these abilities?  I would recommend this if you like unusual reading or science fiction, or war stories.  Based on a true WWII event.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book loved reading it had some great parts like in the dance. Thank God for the diary of a wimpy kid books or I'll  probably wouldn't be reading at all.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|It protects the Kindle, as well as shut it off and on when close and open. Can hold it at an angle while you use it. The only draw back is with use, it will not hold the Kindle at 30 deg angle, do to ware, it will slide a bit but other wise just love it.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Many viewers, this one included, will be comparing this film to the 1995 Amanda Root version, which has long been one of my favorites among the Austen films. And the earlier version is more faithful to the novel, which, like all the Jane Austens, tends to be stiff and emotionally dry. This newer adaptation rises above those limitations and brings the drama to life. Sally Hawkins delivers a blow-away preformance as the late twenties spinster torn between a bad decision she's pressured to live with and the passionate love she still feels. The director (Shergold) must have realized early on what he had in terms of Sally's transcendent abilities for this role. It's hard to believe the original screenplay is the one we see. It's easy to imagine Shergold responding to the early rushes by revising his film plan and sending the writers back to work. If that's what happened--and we can only speculate--then we need to be grateful that he did. The directing is obviously tailored in a special way to Sally's exquisitely emotional portrayal.<br /><br />Much criticism in these reviews has been aimed at the climactic running scene. Purists complain that it is not in the book and contrary to Regency norms. But every filmmaker should try to improve upon the original book. Would anyone really want him to do less? This filmaker clearly succeeds in improving upon the Austen novel. That the running scene mildly breaks with social norms is the very point of it. This is a woman who, at last, is being given a second chance, and it turbocharges her actions to grasping the opportunity she never thought she'd have. Her turbulent, action-oriented closing on triumph satisfies in a way the novels never do. It is the running scene that catapults this adaptation to one of the best love stories ever committed to film. I'd give this movie six stars if I could.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic graphics and very interactive game. always something to do while you have the game open and there's also no absolute need to purchase anything in the game with real money.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great book that was very timely and right out of today's headlines. Having both John Corey and Paul Brenner<br />in the same story was great. Those two are my favorite DeMille characters. I am ready for the next one to come<br />out already.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|This card does its job of showing me more access points, stronger. My laptop's built-in card shows 2 access points: my own, and a neighbor's. This card shows 6, all at full bars. I only recognize the nearby church's signal, which is some 400 feet away, through my house walls, a bunch of trees, and their own walls. So I guess that counts as good! I don't know what I expected to see stepping up to a 2W wifi card, but I at least expected more that seeing 400 feet away. It's entirely possible I just don't have that many access points around me, though.    I installed the Mac OS driver from the ALFA website. It works fine, although you have to use their own wifi tool instead of Apple's Network Preferences tool. That works OK, except for not showing signal strength in the AP list.    I got the card working on Debian 6.0/Wheezy, too. Simply ran this:      sudo apt-get install firmware-realtek    Plugged it in, and NetworkManager started listing access points.    If you're not on Debian: ALFA has a Linux driver on their website, but it uses a kernel header that was removed in 2.6.39. The card chipset is a REALTEK RTL8188RU, if that helps you find a driver for your own distro. This post might help: [...]
B0074QGGK6|5.0|For someone already slaving away in the arts, this book doesn't provide much in the way of new *aha!* material. However, it pulls together the BEST advice from artists of all type in one handy, inspirational place. It's a great book to have open on your Kindle on those days you need to be reminded to attend to your creative development. I'm really enjoying it. For neophytes, this is a great book to start you off with the right habits and practices. Plus, the format -- short sections, quotes and little drawings -- is very entertaining.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|4 Stars & Some Brief Thoughts...<br /><br />This was an interesting experience for me as it was the first book from Colleen Hoover that I've read. Strangely enough, I'm ever-so-slightly disappointed. I want to be clear, as you'll notice, I gave Hopeless 4 stars, and it earned every one of those!! It was truly a good story! But, I was just extremely surprised that, as a whole, I didn't feel like it was a *great* story. To be fair, I think I went in with thoroughly unrealistic expectations after ALL of the rave reviews and high praise for Hopeless. I also managed to guess most of the twists, turns and surprises before they were revealed, which didn't help. So, I brought some of it on myself.<br /><br />For me, hands down, the storytelling in the final 30% was 5-star material, and it *made* this book!! The emotional impact of the twists, turns and revelations, as well as the chemistry and interaction between Sky and Holder, made this section KILLER!<br /><br />Okay, now I really *have to be* honest here. I was quite surprised, particularly in the first half of the book, to find that the technical aspects, occasional word choice, and flow of the writing weren't a little bit more polished. That, along with a bit of lackluster storytelling early on, ultimately decided my 4-star rating.<br /><br />Fair warning, I am most assuredly in the minority where my feelings about this book are concerned, so PLEASE read it for yourself and see what you think. My nitpicking and weird bit of disappointment aside, this is a story you have to experience for yourself. If nothing else, read it for HOLDER.......ROARRRR;-)

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read Oct 2011<br /><br />It never happens, but, during the time I was reading Fifty Shades Darker, I was doing some research online for something altogether unrelated, and I came across the following quote. For me, it captures the essence of Ana's love for Christian, and it honestly gave me chills when I read it and immediately thought of them. I also believe this is truly applicable for *every* relationship.<br /><br />\\"You come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly\\"---Sam Keen, Author<br /><br />What to say, what to say. This series is, in some ways, not at all what I expected, and, in other ways, is even better than expected. This second installment of Christian and Ana's journey has all of the emotion and depth that I felt was missing somewhat from the first book. There is remarkable and substantial character growth in this follow-up, especially for Christian.<br /><br />What is there to say about Christian? Are there words? I found him interesting and compelling in the first book. In Fifty Shades Darker? I am fairly certain I experienced every possible emotion toward and for him, and, in the end, I was as hopelessly in love with him as Ana. Violated by people who had a responsibility, as parent and authority figure, to protect and nurture him, he hid a truly damaged little boy behind a wall of BDSM. He made a legitimate lifestyle choice for all the wrong reasons. And, then, along came Ana.<br /><br />It is one of those beautiful, emotional miracles, that the love of, and for, a particular individual can be the catalyst for rebirth...corny as that may sound. Ana held her ground, held on to herself, in the face of an absolutely overwhelming personality and an intense relationship fraught with extreme highs and lows. She proved herself to be the true strength of their relationship. At the same time, she managed to slowly and meticulously peel back the layers and find that badly damaged little boy again. Ana was exposed to *all* of Christian's imperfections. She was confronted with all the hard stuff, all the baggage. She understood that there was still a lot of work ahead of them, ahead of him. But, she didn't let go. She didn't give up. She truly saw the imperfect Christian perfectly. And that little boy finally, finally, allowed himself to trust and love, and begin to feel worthy of love as well.<br /><br />Their love story, which, truly, fully unfolds in this second installment is deep and powerful, frightening and joyful, functional and dysfunctional, sexy and innocent. Characters like these, a story like this, is why we read.<br /><br />As a final thought, it was very interesting to me to read what seemed almost a deconstruction of Christian's BDSM lifestyle. In a way, it was a refreshing change of pace. Bravo to the author! A story with something of a unique angle is difficult to find in this day and age.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I purchased this game after seeing some kids at my school play it. I was thinking &quot;This can't be that scarey.&quot; HA!  I nearly stopped breathing. The creepy thing about it is Slender Man just slowly walks behind you, slowly gaining on you. If you turn around and see a place you were a minute ago, HE IS THERE. And eventually the scare factor gets up to 11 when his tentacles come out. Eventually, he will catch you, and you will DIE. This game is on my favorites bar on my Kindle, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like anything horror. Even as I write this I feel like someone is behind me. When I bought this game,  I was afraid I was gonna get ripped off. I was shocked at how AWESOME this game is. The graphics are just great. The AI for Slendy is great too. Your goal is to find eight pages ( it is similar to Slender: The Eight Pages I'm guessing) and if you read them they are really creepy. The setting is great with lots of old abandoned everything. Be careful, there's a few places you can get trapped. Now when I first started I freaked out because there were no controls, but once you tap the screen they appear. I reccomend this game greatly. Worth the $1.29 it was.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|A very good first novel, Ms. Flynn made sure every character, with the exception of the very last murder victim, was overwhelmed with mind bending psychological problems and because of this it compelled this reader to happily keep turning pages until the story was told.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I felt the end of the novel was rather rushed and not tied up to my satisfaction.  I think this is, as it should be, a stand alone novel and I really don't see the main character as someone to anchor a series.

0307957837|3.0|The first book was great, with engaging characters, and an interesting alternative world to ours, in which every human has a daemon, an animal of the opposite sex who is the person's best friend and dearest love throughout life. I enjoyed Lyra's adventure to travel north to rescue her friend Roger, kidnapped by evil forces experimenting with separating children from their daemons to unleash and use powerful energies.<br /><br />The second book was also enjoyable, introducing Will, a boy from our world, the epic hero in the making who is worthy of acquiring a weapon that lets him travel among the myriad alternative worlds. He and Lyra become friends and travel together to find  their fathers.<br /><br />The third book became silly, and was a let-down. All through the first two books, religion was an enemy force, but few details are given as to how it became such an enemy, nor specifics on what it promoted. I surmise that the Church suppressed the free expression of sexuality, and this is what made it evil. In the third book, all is explained. I did not like that Pullman recreated the ancient Greek Hades as the grey, listless underworld where the souls of the dead linger in boredom for all eternity. The souls of the dead are presented as being blissfully happy at being released to the world above only to dissipate as individual beings, rapturous at the opportunity to lose their identity and feed plants. Although they are presented as being disembodied souls, they dissipate into atoms that float up into space, meeting their daemons there, who have been waiting since their death there, and after a few seconds of a happpy reunion, both dissolve into nothingness. I personally believe in heaven after we die, and find the prospect of our individual sould living there with God and other souls forever much more nourishing and even believable.<br /><br />There is much too much emphasis on sex. There is nothing explicit, nothing objectionable on those grounds, but the union ofmale and female is depicted as being what gives meaning to life, nay, the entire universe resonates to the blissful sexual union of male and female, and it is only that which permits the natural elements to do what they are called upon to do. The sea, the wind, the trees in the forest, only exist on the foundation of human sexual union. That of Will and Lyra is what saves their worlds and permits the vitiated natural elements to recover their lost vigor and health.<br /><br />The depiction of the ideal society of the mulefa, mini-elephants that require seed-pods from a tree to wheel around on, is rendered at great length. Every aspect of their society is held up for admiration, and I really didn't see the point. The homosexual angel pair which helps Will and Lyra, is inferior to humans, and envies us our physical presence on earth, our strength, our senses, our potency.<br /><br />The children do not kill \\"God,\\" he is so old and decrepit that when he emerges from his box he dissipates on the wind. \\"God\\"'s evil regent, the Metatron, is the character responsible for the iron grip the Church has on humanity, but is depicted as a lecherous, murderous old man, whom Lyra's parents kill. They are only able to do so, though, by their cooperating with each other, again, the sacred union of male and female can accomplish anything.<br /><br />I frankly cannot see why the Catholic Church objected so strongly to this trilogy. It is fatuous and silly, but its depiction of religion is so distant from reality that I don't see how anyone could take it seriously. And no one older than fifteen years old could worship sexual union as the foundation of the universe.

For years I have seen so much T & A when it comes to the ladies that it has become a bit repetitive. For once we saw the men bear it all and I loved it!<br /><br />I hear that they are doing a second movie but it will be awhile until it comes out. I think I heard CT say that it will be 2014 or 2015 when the next one comes out which will be a prequel.<br /><br />I just hope that the second one has a better plot, more developed characters, more dance scenes, more skin, and all of the other things that come with the dark world of stripping. I felt that the movie held back.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I paid $22.00+ for this product, and it is a huge disappointment.  I would recommend it not be purchased.  The indentation for displaying purposes is extremely inadequate and it doesn't stay up.  Extreme waste of money.
B0088WJQ1G|4.0|For a solo endeavor from Glen Hansard, this album retains all of the great qualities of his musicianship. His lyrics and sound seem to reflect a more introspective feel, while some songs like &#34;Maybe Not Tonight&#34; harken back to a Swell Season-esque style. Overall the album is more minimalistic, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Hansard's lyrics have always been incredibly well thought-out, and they shine through on Rhythm and Repose.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Here's a list of things I like and don't like:<br /><br />like:<br /><br />1:The amazing graphics<br />2:The new features like ziplines or minecarts<br />3:One big demon monkey instead of 3<br />4:The new obstacles and powerups<br />5:The new gem system<br /><br />don't like:<br />1:The lack of warning of obstacles when in mines<br />2:The lack of gems<br />3:the lack of original and new characters
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the best Holocaust book I ever had the pleasure of reading and I love everything about it.  It has a great set-up and great suspense.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love the game. The only thing is that the game is.... I don't know what word  to say. But it was very good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone should watch this wonderful series.  I was mesmerized by the story and the characters.  Difficult to stop watching it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've ever read. Initially, the element of time travel had me skeptical, but it pulls you in and holds you until the final word. A true masterpiece on so many levels.
B004LUS390|2.0|I am very disappointed to not be able to shade or blend things. Also desperately needs an \\"eye dropper\\" feature, to copy formerly used colors.<br /><br />Without these, it is to much of a kids drawing app, granted, better than kids, but falls some where in between.<br /><br />Will not save to my photo albums. Granted, the HD Fire is not advertised as a camera device other than for Skype. I do use my camera, and need the ability to save my work to the roll, so I can show others easily. For me it is imperative I be able to save to the camera roll.<br /><br />This doesn't have the amount of brushes and other tools as advertised. Very misleading.<br /><br />I will be looking for another app that I can actually paint with. If anyone knows of one for the Kindle Fire HD, please, leave a comment in the comments section. Thanks!<br /><br />Fix these issues, and I will re- rate.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love the sound effects. They make the game more fun!! My 20 month old grandson enjoys playing as well
B00AREIAI8|2.0|The app is great, when you can get it to open. I've attempted to open the app multiple times on my Kindle fire, and it either gives me a blank grey screen or takes 5+ minutes to load. I don't know if thus is a problem with the app or with my Fire. Please update with a faster startup!!

B002E66C6E|3.0|Lots of great action and a well done movie.  Disappointing that Hollywood tries to give the impression that the US was the first to crack the Enigma code, when Poland having already done so long before (1932) the US got into the war.  The guys at Bletchley Park in England continued to find ways of breaking the ever increasing attempts by Germany to strengthen the ciphers.  Still, good action and worth seeing and...doing a bit of historical seething over!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|It was like experiencing the movie again and again, and I loved the movie.  The sequence of songs flowed seamlessly.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like all the features like the stop watch and timer along with the alarm. I am happy about the big selection of alert tones to pick from. It has a wonderful big display and I use this when I want to time or remind me about anything! Really great alarm app... especially for FREE!!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book, would like to read the third book soon. Catching fire was just as good as expected. Blah blah
1451662432|5.0|Arnold has lived the American dream, immigrating from Europe as a young man to follow his dream.<br />Yes this is PR and a made story to sell a million books. But! This man came to the US with nothing. Became a world champion is his work, made millions, got into the movies, married a Kennedy, became Governor and lived a great life. He has done more than 99.99% of Americans born here. He has achieved the American dream, yet millions of Americans live of the government waiting for a check!<br /><br />Arnold is an inspiration. Work hard, go after what you want and live the American Dream. And hit the gym, get fit.

1481251880|5.0|Ever since i read Beautiful Disaster ive been trying to find a book to fall just as much inlove with. I went threw plenty of different ones that were good but didnt really catch my attention...... until i found HOPELESS!!!!!! I was completely consumed by this book. It was so raw and real that i literally couldnt wait to keep reading! The characters are amazing and the story is brilliant! I truly hope Colleen Hoover decides to give Dean Holder his own POV or his own book period. He is such a great character!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and you get your own horse and gems that you can buy stuff with and buy horse and it is really cool.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is a highly entertaining action movie. The only time I believe you'll see all the best action hero actors together.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A good read. Much better than I expected, but I was hoping for a happier ending. I felt terrible for Peeta.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The first thing (other than the cover) that attracted me to this book is one word used over and over in most reader reviews...  \\"Magical\\".  Magical it is.  This book is beautifully written and brings you deep into an adventure in the past all across the world.<br /><br />Have you ever stopped and remembered what it was like when you were a child and you still believed in Magic, or Santa, or Ghosts and this funny feeling those beliefs create with in you?  This book brings you into a world of that feeling.  If you could imagine a huge, magical, unrealistically amazing circus, that is what this entire book is about.  But more than that it is about the people with in the circus and the author makes you fall in love with every one of them.<br /><br />One thing that I can say is that this is a book that you have to pay great attention to.  The chapters skip around from past to future so sometimes I'd rewind on my Kindle to make sure and remember what time line I was presently reading, but it wasn't really annoying or hard to keep up with.  Also the author goes into really great details about almost everything... but I got the feeling that this book was her 'Baby'...  like she's been holding this tale inside for a very long time and finally burst it all out onto paper and did not hold back at all, not even one little detail.<br /><br />Over all if you enjoy YA reading and think you would like to go back to a time where magic was real in your heart and mind, read this book.  It definitely is simply magical and beautiful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much it is so fun. Me and my sister both play it and absolutely love it so much!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was beyond good, Stephen king wrote in such great detail that it felt as if i was there. A total PAGE  turner ,it started and ended perfectly , exactly how it shod of ended, highly  recommend this book !!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Its a really comfortable mouse and its built well. The only complaint I have is with the glossy material on the outside that can sometimes feel a little sticky. Otherwise, works great, nicely customizeable, and feels well made
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is my favorite game I have ever found or played on a kindle. it is amazing!! some people like temple run but temple run is nothing like it. I mean temple run is fun and all but this game beats it any day. you must download this app!!!!!

1577314808|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!  This book is a life changer.  It will take you deep within your own subconcious mind and cure you of your ills.  Gone are the days of depression, beating yourself up, worrying about the future, mulling over the past!  My promise, is that this book will liberate you!  My prayer is that as many people as possible read this book.  We could have a powerful enriching change in society!  Buy this book and when you love it....You won't have to thank me.

B000JLPMPS|2.0|5 stars for the movie itself and only the two stars for the lousy job Warner Brothers did on this Academy Award Winning movie.  The plot and meaning have already been gone over before by many reviewers here so I will only discuss the quality of the Blu Ray transfer itself.<br /><br />I do have the film on a Standard Def DVD so, while this is not a side by side comparison, I do have the SD version to refer to.<br />The video transfer is not really bad.  There were no artifacts or mis colorization's, no aliasing or ghosting at all.  The warm color grading is hampered a touch by crushed blacks which take away some of the details in the video.  That said, I really didn't think there was much, if any, difference between the SD and this BR version.  The SD DVD was pretty decent to start off with so my guess is that Warner Brothers, in their continuing lazy way, simply reformatted the SD to the BluRay format without any remastering at all.<br /><br />The audio is the bigger shame of the two.  Rather than a lossless audio like DTS HD 5.1 or PCM 5.1, Warner Brothers kept the same audio as the SD DVD which was DD 5.1 , a lossy audio.  While it is fairly clear and the audio levels are nicely balanced,  once one gets used to the lesser compression that lossless audio provides, when you hear the lossy compressed version, it does sound muffled in comparison.  The sub channel is not used in this film despite the thunderstorms because of this compression and the only time the rear channels are used discreetly is for the falling of the rain.<br /><br />The price is right if you don't already have any version of this fine film, but if all you have is the Standard Def version, you will probably not notice much of a difference by going to this disappointing Blu Ray.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksmining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B008CFN95I|5.0|I found this via i09's list of best science fiction and fantasy books of 2012, which is funny, because it really isn't either. What it is, though, is a book for people who love science fiction and fantasy and books and technology. It reminds me of William Gibson's recent work, not because it's dystopian (it isn't, not even slightly), but because it's like science fiction set in the present.<br /><br />It's also beautifully written. I don't read \\"literary fiction\\". I'm a genre snob. But if this is literary fiction, then I like it. The metaphors and turns of phrase are wonderful. \\"Feeding hours like dry twigs into the fire,\\" the author writes. He's conscious of language. \\"Moffat's prose is fine: clear and steady, with just enough sweeping statements about destiny and dragons to keep things well inflated,\\" he says, describing the fictional fantasy novels which play such an important role in the plot, and it could almost be a description of his own writing. He also has semicolons, and he knows how to use them.<br /><br />There's humour that comes from an affectionate, almost loving, way of seeing the absurdity of the world, and from masterfully chosen, mostly technological juxtapositions. \\"The thinnest tendrils of dawn are creeping in from the east. People in New York are softly starting to tweet.\\" Later, the protagonist's Googler girlfriend buys a New York Times \\"but couldn't figure out how to operate it\\".<br /><br />I only spotted a single typo (\\"left\\" instead of \\"loft\\"), and that level of professionalism is vanishingly rare.<br /><br />So: language, 5 stars. I wish every other book I've read recently was written more like this one.<br /><br />Plot, then. The plot is beautifully woven. Not a Chekhov's gun is left unfired. There are about 20 named characters, and virtually all of them, even most of the minor ones, get to participate in the great wrap-up of the epilogue. It's missing one element of the classic happy ending, but that feels absolutely right, and it's better than a happy ending: it's a beautiful ending. It's a rich, wonderful ending. I've often been disappointed by weak endings to books I've otherwise enjoyed, but this is one of my favourite endings of any book I can think of. Five stars for plot, even if the protagonist's ultimate triumph is built on an unlikely mistake earlier in the book, and even if a couple of the events are also unlikely (like Google allowing a relatively minor project to take all their server time for three seconds).<br /><br />And partway through it turns into a heist novel! I love heist novels.<br /><br />Characters. I liked the main character almost immediately. He's having a somewhat difficult time, but he has perspective and wry humour about it, and he doesn't whine. He's capable of admiring and respecting other people greatly, including intelligent, strong women: \\"I am really into the kind of girl you can impress with a prototype,\\" he says. His love for his eccentric, elderly mentor is an important part of what drives the plot.<br /><br />The other characters are all quirky without being self-conscious about it, all (seen through the protagonist's eyes) people of skill and worth and, in general, goodwill. I loved every one of them. Five stars and at least three cheers for the characters.<br /><br />Finally, setting. The book takes place in some wonderfully bizarre places: a tall, narrow bookstore full of mysterious volumes, an underground cavern of cultish scholarship, a textile museum, a storage unit for museum artifacts in the dryness of Nevada where motorized shelves move constantly in a stately dance. That last was totally unlikely. Wouldn't you want to keep valuable, rare items still? And yet it the feel of it was just right, much more so than a more realistic, static building would have been.<br /><br />Even the protagonist's apartment gradually fills with his artist roommate's strange and wonderful miniature city.<br /><br />You could say that the setting is the real world, but you'd be wrong. Aldus Manutius existed, but his friend Gerritszoon didn't, and Gerritszoon's font isn't on every electronic device, because it doesn't exist either. Nor, presumably, does the cult of scholars known as the Unbroken Spine. I have no idea whether Google really works the way it's described, but it wouldn't surprise me at all to hear that it doesn't. And there's one very minor mistake that I know is a mistake: what the main character calls \\"middleware\\" is not what middleware actually is.<br /><br />No, this setting isn't the real world. It's better. Apart from anything else, it has the epic fantasy novels of Moffat in it.<br /><br />Five stars for the setting as well, making it a perfect 20 for this book. Oh, there are things I've quibbled about, but none of them significantly diminished my enjoyment. I'll be looking for more of Robin Sloan's books. I hope they're like this one.u'd be wrong.

B002QRWJA4|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals.  The music is powerful and the movie holds you Spellbound.<br />What Gerard Butler lacks in voice, he more than makes up for in magnetisim.  Emily Rossum is both beautiful and extremely talented. A wonderful pick.
B003L20IJM|5.0|An excellent followup to the first movie in what we hope is a long series.  They went heavier on the special effects this time.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This novel has a fine sense of time and place, characters to care about and a interesting plotline.  Would have liked more details about  the characters middle years, but overall a very good read.

B009E3EWPI|5.0|Artists rarely have moments in their lives when; after many years of fading memories have passed, their art so moves us that we forget our worldly concerns and travel back in time - perhaps ions - to relive that single moment in time that we long for. Any artist who understands their role in life to such a depth - realizes at the last how much love the world can give in return. When all human trappings are removed at that moment - and emotion is laid bare - then the artist fulfills their divine destiny.<br /><br />You only have to look at the still photos from the DVD that reveal what all of us have known about these men for so many lonesome years that they've been removed. But with grace and dignity beyond reproach - they gave of their combined spirit - with John joining from beyond through his son Jason - so that we might finally say to them - thank you.<br /><br />Long live Led.

B000TEUSJK|5.0|Amazing cast of actors, this film is probably near the truth of how Caligula truly was. Being that it's unrated, there are a lot of graphic sexual scenes-has been described by some as near porn.

1401201911|1.0|Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind, economy and Super-powers ended basically just as another regular Superman story, just with him using another black suit. There is nothing in Red Son about a communist Superman or about Comunism itself. It's just another mediocre Superman story throwing just bits of uneducated and biased ideas and giving hints of him dating WW (who cares about that?).<br />Worse than that, the format make the issues so large they become tiring to read. The cover art is beautiful, but the rest inside it really sucks.
B008DKBPTO|4.0|The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that I wish it was just a bit larger in order to hold both the Kindle Paperwhite and the charging cord with the AC adaptor.  As it is, everything will fit but it is snug and has to be arranged very carefully for the case to close.  I really like that it has a secure closure.  I would recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend & I am glad I listened to her.  For an inexpensive buy I wasn't expecting much, but the twists and turns and the writing were awesome. !

B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is just enough of a challenge in these games to make them fun too. Keep up the great work. Thank you.
B001FW58D6|5.0|The other reviewers went into great detail so I will not repeat all of that here. Suffice it to say, they were correct that episodes 2-4 are fairly weak and then the show takes off like a rocket. I have just finished watching all 4 seasons and will buy the 5th which, as always, looks to be a nail-biter. We tried to find a word to describe this show best. \\"Gripping\\" is an apt description. Or as my 35 year old son says, \\"Fringe grabs you by the throat and won't let you go.\\" If you liked X-Files and/or Bones you will find Fringe is better than both. Enjoy!

B004T2QZL8|5.0|I'm not sure what these other reviewers are talking about. I have not once experienced a force close issue. Some of the groups close if you tap or drag too fast or in the wrong spots. But if you're just throwing elements together like that without any thought, then you missed the point of the game.<br />  I love this game. I have since I played it on Kongregate. Which, yes, it is free to play there. But unless you have WiFi wherever you are, you're not going to be able to play it just anywhere. Which, I always thought that was the point of an app on a mobile device. So that you can play anywhere. Anywhere. But whatever. I'm more than happy to support a game developer that made something  I really like, by purchasing their game. I'm pretty sure the reviewers complaining about the price are kids or adults who have never really had to work hard to get paid. I don't see any hard working adult expecting to get something for free, especially when they work in a field where you are selling a product you have to create.<br /><br />I love the challenge of figuring out what makes what. I'm a big fan of the music as well, it's fitting and soothing. I don't really get tired of it, which is saying something since almost every game I play I end up turning the music off. I really enjoy the visual stimulation and entertaining quality of the animation. The hint option is a life saver too, cause when I get stuck I really get stuck. Overall it's a very entertaining and mentally challenging/stimulating game. Great to play with two or more people also!!<br /><br />By the way. I see parents complaining about questionable content. Perhaps, if you did the responsible adult thing and actually viewed the game prior to play, you would've noticed that there is indeed a setting option prompt at the first opening of the app that allows you to block questionable elements from being created. Not to sound judgmental, but in the future please BE a parent instead of just complaining at everyone else.It's your child, your responsibility. No one else's. Don't ruin things for the rest of us because you're lazy at parenting.
B0090SI4HO|4.0|One of Arnie's best efforts in a while IMHO. Action from start to finish albeit some far-fetched tactical errors. Chase scenes alone w/ Corvette are worth the price of admission. Good humor throughout. Arnold is gracefully acknowledging his aging on-screen action character. Looks like they had to tape his middle back to get rid of the flab. 4 stars is because of the actor they cast playing the lead FBI agent. In every movie that particular actor is in, he plays the same overdramatic, \\"pay attention to me\\" style learned in his acting lessons years ago I suppose. Tommy Jones has proven himself in \\"The Fugitive\\" and \\"US Marshalls\\" and would have made the movie 5 stars had they cast him instead as the FBI agent. But a good movie. Will be buying the DVD when it comes out.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought this book was a good read. It kept me interested throughout and was genuinely surprised by the ending!
B0053TMP24|4.0|i could not put it down from start to finish can't wait to read<br />the last one in the series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game gives you a responsibility and it is really fun and exciting. Also very good game u should get this
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Love it plus it's freeee!!!<br /><br />And the weapons and armour is awesome :]<br />And like how u can fight many, many different monsters and creatures
B007QUUJMG|4.0|Great style of writing. You knew &#34;something&#34; was amiss but no hint of what.<br />Charactors real, enough words to let you paint the mind picture.<br />Great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved every minute of it! Can see it as a Hollywood script already, it has everything a great blockbuster needs!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love to know what`s going on with the weather.  This app makes it super easy to find out!  I love everything about it and will recommend this to everyone I know!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|really funny movie.  kept me entertained the hole time.  good pacing, great story, very imaginative.  actually laughed out loud many times.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I kinda was looking for a different ending...maybe it was just me.  Not your ordinary King book.  Gripping, nonetheless...but different.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|thought it would be much cooler.  very short, for the price I wanted many more levels.  I will just see play the fee one.
B007KLKFSO|5.0|I am in my early forties but I love a well written YAF.  This is up there, a bit left off centre, so makes it more interesting then some of the Young Adult Fiction that is been churned out.  Highly recommended.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I enjoyed the movie for the most part.  the actors are really good.  the ending was so disappointing.  I won't spoil it, but it was really good until then.  good looking movie , just wish it ended differently.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is the best show on TV. I love new episodes as well as the reruns. The characters are amazing and I can't wait to see how their relationships continue to grow.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really liked this book.  mystery, action, some romance, and keeps you guessing.  very easy read, didn't want to put it down.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Great story-one of his better in recent years.  I would definitely recommend to others
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Takes a lot of time to get games unless you are willing to spend the money to purchase the points to buy the games.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great story line. I loved how it mixed facts with what could have been. It lagged in areas but over all is a fantastic book!
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Game of Thrones is an excellent tv series, the acting is above average and the story is very entertaining and fast paced, without lacking depth.<br />If you liked the book version, the story in season one follows the exact same events, but sometimes it cuts short on some parts. This is pretty obvious considering HBO has condensed a 1000 pages book in just 10 episodes, and it has no real impact on the watchability of the series.<br />I take one star away for the limited downloads you get with amazon instant video, it doesn't make a lot of sense since the price tag is in line with the DVD version.<br />Looking forward to getting the 2nd season as soon as available.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is a really fun game and it is better than the original temple run and I enjoy playing it a lot so I do recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun game to play;))
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow u should really get this game so fun you won't be disappointed my favorite hair is the rainbow spikes hair love it  I'm a pegisister woop
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked it! It was intriguing and really different from the Harry potter series. I do recommend it. It is different
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses move realistically.  My 6 year old and I love playing this game together. There are easy yet fun activities and beautiful horses. Great for the horse lover.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Awesome building new houses and all the cages. Making all your own eggs for the animals. Lava pits and fire barrels.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Only $22 for both theatrical and special edition/director's cut versions of each movie. that's only $2.75 per version. The box is one of those unwieldy cardboard/plastic fold-out deals, and with 9 discs the thing is 5ft 4in long when fully opened! Comes with a nice booklet detailing each version.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very inventive, with wonderful 80s trivia and references.  I loved it.  Highly recommended to anyone who loved Pac Man, War Games and Member's only jackets.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome new stuff to dodge u even get to ride in a cart through a tunnel its awesome get it its worth it  totaly fun
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I'm a David Baldacci fan and he rarely disappoints.  Split Second is a page turner. Another winner for<br />this author!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I totally loved this wonderful dvd.I watched it last night&I will watch it again soon.PIXAR is sweet!!!!Makes me feel like a kid again!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|really cool...greatest advantage is I can play my video files without taking up my kindle fire's storage space I recommend it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I loved this game from the very beginning. It is really good for young horse lovers like me. The only problem is that every time you want to play it again you have to reload it. I saw that other people were having this problem too. Fortunately it saves your place in the game. Minus the one problem it is a great game.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I began watching episodes on YouTube, but was dismayed when one episode wasn't available.  So when I saw it at the store, I snapped it up and watched the whole thing as soon as I got home.<br /><br />I have to say that this live action HALO movie is excellently done.  The special effects are terrific, and you really get a sense that it IS real.  Watch the Special Features about how they made the special effects, the Warthog, and the Master Chief armor.<br /><br />This definitely ties in to HALO 4 in that we see how it all began.<br /><br />If you love HALO 4, pick this up in BluRay and turn up the volume.  You won't regret it!
1452110581|4.0|This is a neat little book that's a great gift for the cat lover in your life. Just wish it was physically a bit bigger with bigger print, kinda hard on the eyes for those of us with less than 20/20 vision. That's why I only give it 4 stars.
B005STGKI4|3.0|This is a pretty poor effort at a reproduction of a great album. The sound quality is not an issue but the original album jacket/cover was a really nice fold out cover with pictures of the band in the studio. This one is just a plain cover with no extra sleeve/insert or any thing with any of the original content, front and back cover only, what you see is what you get. I was quite disappointed with this one...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book the story line is unbeliveable and really has me stuck I can't wait to find out what happens with Lelia.The passion in this book is crazy and makes me want to find someone like him and have the passion they have. I hope more people enjoy the story the same as I have
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Have watch it to much but this is the best way. No other Pride and Prejudice can compare. All the characters are full and rich. Next best thing to reading book.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is a great app to have if you have a little one. Especially if your going out to eat or something keeps them busy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so much fun! I have a love for horses and this game is a great to express it.
B0085KGHOK|5.0|Bands today are actually spending significant money to make decent concert DVD's and it's starting to show.<br /><br />The band RUSH has mastered the ability to market and retail themselves via these concert DVD's.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a balls to the wall rocker of a DVD.<br /><br />The camera work is decent. At the beginning of the video, many in the crowd have these flags on long poles that block the view of the band. The camera crew must have realized this because by the forth song all the flags were gone. Other than that, camera work was good with good angles, views, well centered and steady.<br /><br />I thought the sound was well mixed with everyone well represented.<br /><br />This DVD is a straight-forward concert just as would be if you were physically there. I REALLY appreciate that... No self-gratifying interviews, cartoons or silliness mixed within the concert footage.<br /><br />There's a bonus section that contains features such as, music videos and some interviews. The typical stuff found on every other music DVD you buy today.<br /><br />Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found Wool when searching for Dystopian fiction on Amazon. I downloaded the first part (a short story), admittedly, because it was free but by the time I finished this brief journey into Silo 18, I was hooked so I purchased the Omnibus edition and I haven't been able to put it down! I am always thrilled when an author can make me feel as though I am living the story at that moment, that I am experiencing  what the characters are going through, and I have such an emotional stake in the outcome of the journey itself. This is so much more than just a story...it's an adventure that grabs hold and whisks you away for the duration and I truly hope there are more stories to tell as the author has alluded to at the end of part 5.
B004XCUEXY|5.0|I gave this DVD 5 stars based on what it was... A documentary.<br /><br />Let's get this out first... If you're looking to rock out, it isn't going to happen with this DVD!<br /><br />This basically is the tale of Dave Grohl from youth to present day and I must say I was surprisingly drawn in!<br /><br />VERY tastefully done and showcases the talent of Grohl which I wasn't fully aware of before watching this.<br /><br />Very little time spent on discussing Nirvana... I guess there's not much interest in discussing something you never made a dime for doing?<br /><br />I've watched this DVD twice, will I watch it again? No... It's a documentary not a performance. I got the message second time around!<br /><br />I'm certain the diehards already have this DVD... If you know little or nothing about the FF, I still think this is a great video worthy of watching just for the entertainment value if nothing else.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not a fan of PBS but every now and then, they will have a program that catches my interest and I'll spend the next two hours watching... I think this is that type of video.<br /><br />Enjoy...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|In this app there are over 100 different minigames so you won't get bored for quite a while so try it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love all the games, all are amazing and very fun. love how you have to gain coins to get the games. so much fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great. Others should play this if they are horse lover's. I had fun playing this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game for all ages I highly recommend this app<br />ok ten more words umm... blah blah blah blah blah
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the second book in the series. Definitely as good as the first. Only problem ... I borrowed the book, still have time left, but it doesn't allow to let me finish it. Can't go past chapter 22. Bummer.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I really like Diana Gaboldon's books about Scotland and have read many of them.  This was just another good example
B00969PR18|4.0|Works good! The price is right! I find this app to be very good. the fact that the app can work off line makes it a winner. Sometimes has trouble starting on my kindle fire.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Fun and time consuming. Great game to play when bored. The fact that you're controlling the car through motions makes it very easy but yet challenging
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It takes to long it takes like 50 secends for every number to go through right now mine is a 36 ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But  i'll give it a 5 because I like this game:)
B007WFTFG6|4.0|The pictures are sometimes a little small, but a great variety for both boys and girls to color on the kindle
B0086700CM|5.0|Items arrived in a swift time period<br />and 5 year old is totally am happy with it.<br />it worked well,<br />thanks I will certainly seeks your site again...

B007N6EUHI|5.0|I use this app on my 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire and I am very satisfied.  It runs well and I have not yet encountered any glitches.  I use the app during class to help me visualize muscles, nerves, bones and general body parts.  I like having the ability to fade or hide structures so that I can view the area behind them.  Most structures are available although I have found a few that are not.  For example, I could not find the six intervertebral ligaments within the app.  However, that is getting down to some pretty detailed nitty, gritty!  I highly recommend it and believe that it was money well spent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My older brother sugested i get this I wonder what ots like  ;)  :O  these last words are random b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
B000002V07|4.0|Disc was in very good condition...no scratches..this was a present for my husbands birthday and it came judt in time..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Super fun creep game. I loved the graphics and the storyline. I recommend this app it is a great free game. Puzzles, matching, and find that item challenges throughout. Good times!
B00080ZG1A|4.0|Anyone that is a fan watch this movie...can't believe he didn't win an academy award...disc in new conditon even though it was used...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All of my friends and Family love Downton Abby! Each Episode is 45 min long and each season gets better and better!
B0090YHSFC|4.0|This is a fun game you could say it cuts me up to play.  Can also be used to teach children patients.
B002VPE1X4|4.0|Purchased this case to use with the GPS in the car.  It needed protection from scratches and other storage in the car issues.  Great size and perfect padding.  Great Price!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is the best rts I have played so far.  You have three races each with unique abilities.  Battle on land air and sea.
B00846REIS|3.0|It had too many similarities to 50 shades. I found it irritating at times, like I had already read this book. I was hoping for something different. All and all I still finished it and I am slightly curios about the twist at the end.
B0082Z447U|5.0|A great read! Couldn't put the book down. I loved the way it was &#34;written&#34; in rather old fashioned prose by different &#34;eyewitnesses.&#34;
B0068FYZH0|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, I am so glad I got Blu-ray and DVD version. The special features such as deleted scenes really are nice.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This is a must have for anyone trying to implement healthy hair habits into their daily routine.  Very informative and insightful.
B005DI9906|5.0|A classic in every sense of the word and part of the Criterion Collection says it all. A must see for all vintage movie lovers.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Twenty One Pilots is absolutely incredible. You need to buy the entire album and you need to do it now. I have no idea how Amazon or iTunes classifies the band as one genre in particular, because everything is here. And it works, start to finish. twenty one pilots made a deliberate choice not to adhere to the restrictions of any one particular style, and the liberation is palpable. Vessel is thoughtful and intricate and composed and unhinged and brilliant. I realize that that doesn't make sense, but when you listen, you'll understand.
0307593525|5.0|My wife has loved Julia Child for most of her life however has never purchased any of her cookbooks. I got this for her as a side Christmas present and it has been a great success. Not only are we eating some excellent meals but she is in heaven and has learned so much from cooking from them.  If you love cooking and learning, you won't be disappointed.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It's always nice to get a good book for Kindle Looking forward to ordering more books from amazon for kindle
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|The movie was a lot of fun, and so I thought I'd love the Soundtrack...I was only disapointed at how short the soundtrack was...but still love it. :)
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Good read, good ending...well written and an intriguing read along the lines of hunger games.  Recommend for a light read.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I wasn't sure about the vocal abilities of the star cast...and as the movie progressed, I was drawn into the classic tail...
B000001GPX|5.0|It's difficult to bring a valid fresh perspective to such well known works but Kleiber succeeds. This is now one of my favorite 5ths.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case is exactly what I was looking for. So versatile. I love that it came in many colors and isnt balky.
0553386794|5.0|This book is amazing! It's one the few page-turners I've read and even if you've already seen the show, it keeps you on your feet. The book goes even more into the character's stories than the show does, as well. Although it was lengthy, I finished it very quickly. I'm now currently on the fourth book of the series.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a good game, took more than a few hours to beat.  Lots of Hidden Object fun and puzzles range from easy to hard, I actually had to use the in game guide/walkthroughs couple of times. The guide is easy accessible from within the game which is a great bonus.  Good graphics.
0142410705|5.0|This book was funny, clever, and witty, which I like in all my books. It's not a fault in our stars, but &#34;Katherines&#34; is definitely a great book in it's own right.
0486408434|5.0|This is a definate must have for beginners.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|this is an excellent documentry if you want to know more about the band memebers.  i love all the interviews they have collected and the history about alot of the songs.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I will watch it all year long. It is one of my favorite movies ever, I don't care if it is a Christmas movie.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app will come in handy when I'm traveling or just can't seem to chill out.  It has a huge variety of sounds installed and more to download.  Looks like it has a functional alarm clock as part of the app as well.  Looks like a winner to me.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Typical Tim Burton ~ tears, laughter and melancholy ... but, per Tim's mo, he brings it around at the end!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It's format and style differ from his other novels but this BBC lends itself to the story. It is a sad story that, as with all of Albom's books ends with redemption, which is what I look for when I pick up any of his.
B002M87V0A|4.0|Our Church is doing a &#34;Music Man Show&#34; and having the cast here watch this movie helped so much.<br />this story is wonderful and makes you laugh about what happens in pretty much 'real' towns. Great for all ages.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|Bought this for my nephew, the magazines are hard to load for little kids and the firing mechanism is also not the most well designed. Had I designed this I would have made the motor come on with a half pull of the trigger then fire with a full pull of the trigger.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Good book.everybody  should read it there are so many versions but this one is the absolute best one I have ever read
B009T3AHDE|5.0|Cosmopolis is a unique, intriguing movie by a master director and I loved it as much as I thought I would. I would loved to have seen it first in the cinema but the limited release was a disappointment. I especially loved the spot-on performances by Robert Pattinson and Paul Giamatti.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Amusing, different, fresh.  A feel good film with interesting characters on the order of The Darjeeling Limited.  There is not a shred of formula laughs or tired old plot. Absurd but never ridiculous.
B00AYQNOU8|2.0|This movie is a random collage of scenes from all around the world. Beautiful places and images to be sure, but nothing more than that. After about 10-15 min, it gets boring and monotonous and I like Discovery-Channel-type movies. But as you watch, you want to know where these places are, who are the people, and what are the activities that they are showing, but naah! In any case, this felt more like a screensaver than a movie...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it look so much better. Not to mention the monkey on steroids. I need More words so gsgdh shdgdg dhrhd dhdgduf dyehdg.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The story is well written and kept me interested throughout.  It was not an uplifting story but there were parts of the book that philosophized about dying and the marks we all make in this life that were optimistic.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It took 8 minutes to download on my kindle!  I'm not sure if it's just my internet connection or the game though. But when it was done downloading it was a really cute game :)
B00A81MV3U|1.0|One star because zero stars isn't an option, nor is a black hole icon. I should know better than to dis this film, as most films I hate only draw comments from idiots. But for the sheer pleasure of it, I'll say this: I hated the writing, the acting (especially deNiro, who has been doing this same role for at least ten years and has apparently abandoned the use of his talent, and his wife-character), the characters themselves, the directing, the cinematography, the casting, the scenic design and the overall conception - where a \\"silver lining\\" is imposed on the story rather than grows out of it. I didn't find a single scene emotionally believable, felt the script demeaned mental illness, thought the film pandered to blacks, sports, dancing-with-the-stars fans, Philly itself, endorsed gambling, rewarded incredible stupidity and risk-taking (deNiro's character is willing to throw away his entire family's future based on nothing other than an idiotic hunch by a sexpot) while the film pretends to endorse other \\"moral\\" life choices, thought the entire film depended on \\"cute\\" writing and cliche (where plot is a substitute for canned laughter), and that it was predictable after the first ten minutes. By the way, the audience I was with, maybe 50 people, didn't laugh that much. What's not to hate? Over many years I've learned that many people often think something is funny if someone else tells them it's supposed to be. I'm not one. Now go ahead and trash me if you like. But if I can keep one person from seeing it I'll have done my duty. And if one other Amazon reader has the guts to agree with me: brother, (or sister) -  welcome to the real world!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son aNd I both reAlly enjoy this game...My husband thinks I'm crazy but we love it...trying cor the zebra...That's my goal
B001JI8IJW|5.0|I just saw this movie a few days ago and love it. I love Cold War themed movies and this movie was great.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I learned a lot about Mr Jackson. I admire him a lot more after reading the book. I even went out and bought some of his music cds.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is awesome it is totally worth the money you should get it but beware you will get addicted easily
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie it is very very very very very very very very very very very good
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this app because it has very detailed customization options. Have been using this instead of my phone's alarm, it's way more attuned to what I want.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Well it is very challenging and you need to figure out how to build your moving machine in order to get through the rounds. Me already stuck on one of rounds. Ha ha. Think after playing for awhile I will get better on building machine. Have patience for this and don't quit.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|There are other good, detailed reviews here so I won't repeat them. In short, I think this is an outstanding book that will appeal to people who don't easily relate to &#34;typical&#34; spiritual work (e.g., agnostics, atheists). If you haven't been exposed to Tolle's work, I think it would be best to start with The Power of Now to get a solid basis for his concepts, but that isn't critical for enjoying this book.<br /><br />My one caveat is sometimes the quality of writing could be improved, but the importance of the message takes precedence.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was recommended this book by several friends and it was well worth the read. When u think u have gotten figured out it takes another turn! Great book!
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Enjoyable modern takes on Christmas music. Mixes in well with more classic material. It was perfect for the price I paid ($0.00) but actually worth much more than that!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett continues to create amazing characters. The further I read into the story, the more difficult it was to put the book down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Katie was a strong and believable heroine. A heartwarming story with suspense and a happy ending.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|This review is from the perspective of someone who: appreciates the Progressive Rock sensibility and listened to a a lot of it in the mid=70's to early 80's, felt bored with prog rock being made after the 70's ended, then found some other genres of music to tune into,and then over the last decade re-collected the prog rock albums on CD that I had  on LP as a teen through twenty-something,and have kept a lookout for more recent prog rock. I picked up Snakes and Arrows, Snakes and Arrows Live, thought they were OK.<br />On the first listen to Clockwork Angels the songs just didn't stand up to the standards of that found on Permanent Waves or 2112. I took the cd along with Snakes and Arrows back to a local independent record store a couple months ago, traded them in for credit towards other cds because after a few listens they didn't hold my attention. The production sounded dull. The drive struck me as a bit repetitive. But I did rip a copy of CW Angels and after having listened to it at work after a not hearing it for a couple months it sounded better. After a couple more listens, I've changed my mind and have a positive impression of the music. The sound is more chunky or monolithic than the 70's-ealy 80's Rush sound.  But the album's strengths have come out now and I replaced my copy. A lot of thought and work went into the concept and playing on Clockwork Angels. There is fine playing and the mix actually does fit the music. There is significant beauty in this beast after all.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|The game is fun to play, but the free version is only a trial, that's. why. I gave it 3 stars.
0307987647|2.0|Two disappointments:  1)  No table of contents or indexing of what's on each of the 36 or so Audio CD's.  What could be simpler than an accompanying single piece of paper with this information.  2)  Disappointed with the narrated rendition.  I am a BIG FAN of the King of Thrones Genre.  The narration is bland at best.  Too bad.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Haven't had this long, looking forward to see how it holds up with more use.  Very easy to insert my kindle and remove when need be.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think you should get it my brother is loving it so i tried it to  then my sister tried it and wee loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ittttttt
B00B2G4OUS|2.0|Parts of his performance made me cringe they we so awful. He's a terrific actor, so I don't know what was happening here. He didn't have chemistry with any of the cast and the whole thing seemed awkward and forced. Pilots can be a little rough around the edges, so maybe this will get better with time. Overall, I'm didn't like it enough to make it 'appointment' TV.
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|I downloaded this game on my kf for my son it was slow going to get things done in the game and as with most \\"free\\" games they really want you to use real money to buy stuff that makes the game move faster. Well the first time he plaited for a bit and then everything got very hosed up he could do NOTHING I reloaded it again and he got bit more into the game before it happened once again no way to finish task but he still liked it until I downloaded an update then the game changed and not for the better my son is 7 and now it seems like a muck harder game for him. He is much happier playing almost anything elsexat this point I'm sure it won't be on my of much longer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You loved the first one you'll love the second one! The graphics are amazing compared to the first one. It is deffenitaly worth getting!!!
B00005JMJG|1.0|What is good about a man wanting to keep memories of a woman who has erased all her memories of him? The only thing I liked about the movie was the poem Kirsten Dunst's character recited, that's it. The only reason this gets a star is because you have to rate an item on Amazon otherwise your review won't be posted.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Good fun can't put it down. Everybody from kid to adults want to have a go. This one is very challenging.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time! It kept me guessing. Definitely a must read if you enjoy suspense.
B009329ZF2|1.0|its bad, like really bad. the charterers had no thought processes, no common sense. there was so many holes in the story. dialog? nope. had none, there was no real military tactics at all and how is it that the battle ship that's bin parked since the war is fully fueled and armed? and some how ran by a elderly skeleton crew.. this movie should of never bin made.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|My grandson love them but since the sock wouldn't stretch, we never got th<br />e whole sock on. He would just hold it and make it rattle.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I think this movie is big-time underrated.  It's predictable, yeah, but so was Sling Blade.  Everything in a story isn't about surprise.  Anyway...<br /><br />With over a thousand reviews already rockin' Amazon, I just wanted to throw in a word for the Blu-ray.  Even though Cars is only about my 7th Most Favorite Pixar flick, it's a top 3 Pixar Blu-ray.  The following scenes, as rendered on Blu-ray, are really among my most pleasurable visual experiences of all time, not just counting stuff I saw on a tv screen:<br /><br />* The drive after the opening race.  From leaving the race track at night, all through the \\"Life is a Highway\\" montage, and then through the ordeal with the young punk cars, I almost can't believe what I'm looking at.  A dream sequence for anybody that's been intoxicated by highway driving at night:  the quiet, sleepy feeling, the low rumbles of the wheels, all those lights going by.  They even somehow captured that \\"show-is-over\\" feeling you get after a big arena event, the welcome of cool darkness and low playing radio after a big noisy show.  I could watch this section of the movie over and over.<br /><br />* Sally's and McQueen's ride together on the country road.<br /><br />* The dance/cruise night when the neon lights come on.  At the theater, I think my mouth literally dropped open at this.  I couldn't get over the neon and the reflections in the metallic paint and chrome.  And beyond the technical wizardry of making it look so real, they know how to make it look pleasant.  I sometimes wonder how many times they had to choose between what would be aesthetically pleasing and what would be utmost realism.  These guys are real masters, I think on the level with great painters, etc.<br /><br />There are other places I could go on about, but that gives you the idea.  If you even moderately enjoy Cars, get it on Blu-ray.  Or borrow it and watch those three scenes.  If those don't blow your mind, then I guess you can skip it (though it might be time for eye glasses...)
B0000067L2|5.0|I was a guitarist in a rock group from Jan 1967 to March 1970, (the \\"late 60's\\"), and then another group from Jan 1971 to May 1973.<br />I was an excellent rock player.  I should say that Clapton's guitar work on Disraeli Gears is excellent and whereas it may not<br />be mind blowing as some guitar work by others was back then, it fits the compositions perfectly.<br /><br />A special comment should be made unto Clapton's solos, they are delicately articulated; it's difficult to reproduce his articulation convincingly.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks as some have said, every track is an essential part of this album and contributes to it equally.<br /><br />Two other items are important:  The compositions were written by several different people, so we get a mix of well synthesized<br />rock composition on this album, they all go together and flow smoothly.  Also, the album was recorded in New York City at the<br />tail end of Cream's first USA tour, and according to at least one source, in only 3 days, which may explain why there seems<br />to be a slight roughness to the recording.  Or maybe we can just call it \\"Live in the Studio\\".<br /><br />The disbanding of Cream was a surprise and shock to everyone back then.  But they had completely run through their rock stylings;<br />any further attempt at recording albums would have been redundant.<br /><br />This is truly one album you never get tired of listening to, indeed, it gets better with every spin, and is the best of their<br />four great albums.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is the first book I have read in a long time that has made me openly laugh.  The main character Mark Watney grows on you.  His jovial attitude in the face of adversity and resourcefulness are to be admired.  It is like castaway only on Mars.  A quick and enjoyable read.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|There was no greater feeling of the sheer power of the Doors than playing their tunes in the late 60's live at local gigs,<br />and that's exactly what I did with my group back then, being one of the first groups in my area to do so, with the climax of<br />the evening being our rendition of 'Horse Latitudes' followed by a slightly stretched version of 'When the Music's Over',<br />bringing down the house each time.  It took awhile for the Doors to catch on in 1967, and we took full advantage of that,<br />playing relatively unknown and hitherto unheard of tunes for crowds that would just stop dancing and stare and wonder<br />what it was that we were playing, whether it be the two I mentioned or some other Doors tunes like 'Soul Kitchen',<br />'Crystal Ship', and others from the first three albums.<br /><br />The first two Doors albums, 'The Doors' and 'Strange Days', are truly the epitome of late 60's rock and a crowning<br />achievement of rock composition.  Robbie Krieger's guitar work, and Ray Manzarek's keyboards and bass, both very<br />unique at the time and even unto today, simply took you to another place in music, and along with John Densmore's<br />jazzy drumming and Jim's great vocals and lyrics, simply were among the best of the musical endeavors reaching out<br />over the airwaves in those days. We never knew what would come out next, and in 1967, were continually surprised<br />and amazed by it all.<br /><br />Those were the days, they will never come again, but we have Morrison and all others from back then to thank for the<br />gift of great music.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I was born in 1962 and it is fun to see what was going on at the time I was born. It is engaging and it does not hurt to have the main character Don Drapper so handsome. The ladies are pretty too! All in all is a good show. Crazy how things were back then and how much they have changed.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|We are in our mid 50s and we went to see this movie at the theaters. We loved it! laughed out loud with the kids at the theater. I bought this for our first grandchild who was just born two weeks ago. This is a must for all families!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I like this application is great. It has lots of new sounds to update and seems to be fairly simple to run.
0307341577|4.0|I just finished this and, once again, loved Gillian's writing. True, the beginning chapters didn't grab me, but it wasn't long before I couldn't put the book down. I love the back and forth between charactors points of view, then and now, via journal - like - entries. This seems to be Flynn's MO and it works for me. Can't wait to emerse myself into her world again soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved how he it was and it was the best free app ever in the hole world. I loved it it was amazing.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I like this app. It teaches you how to play piano and classical music like, swan lake and moonlit sonta an so much more! great app!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful!  I read this book before, but wanted the chance to read it again and own it. I liked it just as well the second time around!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is the best movie I've seen in 2012, It's good for the whole family. Very funny and meaningiful. This touching movie is not only a must see, but a must own...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool  game  for every one. Who might love horses like me I love this game  I love this game u guys don't know what u r missing
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Great game, I love it! Just to draw something and to see if someone can guess what it is... Love It!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great deal<br />The game is to make sure that your operating system is supported the world of bones are not be a good time to use the world and ally undead t
B00B2V66VS|4.0|although it's  the second one and its supposed to be better i would still rather to play the original temple run:)
B002IW8V0E|5.0|Loved the film & music & the cast. Meryl Streep can do anything & with pizzazz! She is the best!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I like the point that I can take pictures, but am confused as to why you have the button to push in front where I can not see it very well.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I am not a big fan, but I do like many songs on this album.  I did purchase this for my child, but I can also listen to it!  LOL!  I prefer a good rock song with a powerful singer, but she definitely has some catchy tunes!
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|It's kind of addictive, but annoying.  The animations are time consuming, but easily (usually) bypassed with tapping.  My problem is the lack of explanation.  I need words, not just animations to explain the different aspects they throw in as you get to higher levels.  And a \\"hint\\" button would help, there were too many boards I just had to skip because logic was not working for me (and I do believe I'm more than reasonably smart).  I'm not entirely sure what the \\"red\\" stuff over the cheese does.  Sometimes I think it speeds up my mouse, other times it seems to throw off the rat or speed him up or stop the cat.  I just don't know!  Despite the annoyances, I find myself drawn to this game, so it's got a great concept, it just needs some tweaking.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked the book.  It keeps you wondering what's is next.<br />I looking forward in seeing what is next on the remaining books.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Great Selection! Bought for my son for Christmas and he really liked it. He had already watched season one. Can wait to get the next one!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The disgusting chat going on has ruined what could be an amazingly good app. Too bad the makers didn't think this through a little better I'm 56 years old and the last thing I want is to read filth while trying to play some bingo!<br />The game itself, super, but I uninstalled it quickly after opening it. Too bad for Buffalo Studios!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really fun and I have a really fun time takeing care of my horse and the horse is really cute
B00ANAC32U|5.0|This bumper is great! Perfect match to my beloved N4 and serving it's purpose better than any aftermarket case/bumper! And it also doesn't cover gorgeous back panel of the phone - a big plus to me!<br /><br />I don't understand people reviewing SELLERS in a PRODUCT REVIEW!<br />As to overpricing, market is called MARKET for a reason!<br />Think of it like Ground vs. Overnight shipping - if you want it ASAP be prepared to pay a premium on a shipping price! Otherwise save money and wait, wait, wait... Until it's available in a Google Play Store ;)  It's your choice & nobody's twisting your leg!<br />Just my 5c...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I just beat this game can not wait till the next one comes out thanks fir listening bye guys and girls or whoever
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|You have to watch each episode more than once to really see the character development. The entry of Shirley  M. as the other grandmother was a little disappointing.....a bit &#34;over the top&#34; in costume and makeup. Not very subtle. I enjoyed it and I am a big fan of DA.
B00746TURW|5.0|This book is one of those rare books that strips away<br /> artifice and exposes human truth so well it aches. It is an achingly good story of loss, life, suffering and hope. Beautifully narrated - pure and uncluttered prose - the purity and beauty of Kafka or Coetzee.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|this game is great, but it really needs to fix a bug where the play button doesnt show up. then, when you find a different play button, the game freezes. then when you try to reopen it, it freezes and exits the game, the only way to fix is to uninstall and reinstall. this loses all my progress and is very frustrating. please fix imangi studios!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great product Great Price Sony brand so you know it is going to be quality. Will be waiting for next sale
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Wow I have to say t ha t I was and still am addicted to subway surfer ! It is Great how you can unlock a bunch of things , you can unlock huge mystery boxes with millions and millions of coins ! Multiple people to choose from and play with ! My only issue with this game is that it  is so expense to buy things ! THANCKS for reading<br /><br />Hi I'm jazzy and this is jazzy reviews !########
B008RA3X5E|5.0|What can I say.  It tells time and it looks good.  I love the features that it has.  I Love Amazon Apps.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has lots of fun stuff to do and I love it. I would recommend it for anyone who loves animals or horses
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have been using Yahoo Mail for years.  It is good to be able to have it in my Phone as well as My Kindle and my Computer

B00AGOGOLE|5.0|My Camera works very well.  The pictures always come out clear. I intend to use this camera wherever I go now that I have my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good game I guess I wish it would not take so long to open and I wish you do not have to have 6000 coins to buy a new horse
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large buttons make this calculator user friendly. This is  simple and  easy to use. What more could you ask for?
B008JH5HCW|5.0|Great action movie!!! If you like Guy Pearce, then you will like this movie. . .I think it is one of his best.
1607066017|5.0|This great series is written by the great Brian K. Vaughn and comes to life with the illustrations of Fiona Staples. You might recognize Brian K. Vaughn's name from his fantastic work of Y: The Last Man. I won't include any spoilers, but just know that if you are a fan of great stories, a good blend of action and humor, and beautiful illustrations then Saga is definitely something you should check out.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I could see how this may help someone that needs some common noises to fall asleep or to keep concentration on a particular task. I downloaded it because I maybe able to use it while traveling to keep the outside noises at bay.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series ... we enjoy watching at our own pace. No commericals ... can't wait for season 3 ... great, gfreat, great

B005CKPQ7A|5.0|I don't think I can say much that many other people haven't already said. This show is just plain awesome.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|I love the edgy pop/blues/rock vibe of this record. There are some serious hooks that grab listeners and hold their attention for days!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre twice and if you're a sucker for music, cheap jokes, and cheesy romance, this movie is for you. LOVED IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is  a really great game and I highly enjoy playing it. It is still much fun and easy to catch on. Everyone who plays this game should love it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My sisters absolutely loves this game. One is three and the other is eight and they will spend hour long car rides cutting, coloring, and washing different character's hair. Great purchase!
B00992CF6W|4.0|the games great, but I wish you could blow TNT up in creative with out the use of mods, that should be the next update.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I had a really hard time reading this book because when I was younger I had already read the Uglies series and I kind of felt like I was reading the uglies series all over again! It took me forever to read it and I lost interest many times in the book. I liked it enough to finish it, but not enough to read the next one. If I hadn't already read a series so similar to this one, I probably would have throroughly enjoyed it.
B0079J27SS|5.0|This EMI CD should appeal to all Mozart lovers.  The legendary Otto Klemperer leads two equally  legendary European orchestras, the Philharmonia and the New Philharmonia, in magnificent digitally remastered performances of Mozart's last six symphonies.  Klemperer's readings of these great symphonies, especially 39, 40 and 41 &#34;Jupiter&#34;, are a delight to the ears.  One should not be distracted by hyper-technical, jousting reviews of the technical merits and demerits of EMI's remastered reproduction of these 50 year old performances led by one of music history's most revered interpreters of Mozart.  This EMI CD may have technical shortcomings here or there, but the listening experience, which is what really counts for a typical music consumer like me, is truly excellent.  Those of us who love classical music should be grateful to EMI for resurrecting these incredible Klemperer recordings, which otherwise would have been lost to the ages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love to be surprised and this book had that element for me. By far the best book I've read in a long time and the characters were fantastic. It was a beautiful story that really made ya cheer for their love. Interesting characters, interesting story, and a romance that's more than sex and falling in and out of love.
B000MDHJFE|4.0|It was fun watching an old racy movie, love Jimmy Stewart. It was maybe a little slow getting going, and perhaps predicatble but very entertaining once it got moving.  The music (Duke Ellington) was a delight.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|Was a great hit. Range is great and all the parts make this a big gun. We loved the gun.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The victims appear hooded and bound.<br /><br />The loopers know that their employers are phasing out loopers.<br /><br />The loopers also know when the victim is laden with gold plates, they've just executed their future selves, and are thereby phased out.<br /><br />So why aren't loopers checking victims for gold plates before shooting?<br /><br />Because Rian Johnson wrote it.<br /><br />Some very good acting in a good-looking film, but now Johnson is three-for-three in having characters who aren't thinking nor doing what any credible individual would think or do in these situations--and no, it can't be begged off with the excuse that it's scifi. In fact, the only way an outlandish situation works in fiction is if the characters caught in it take it seriously as their reality. Not in RJ's world.<br /><br />At least he's cut down on embarrassing dialogue this time around; Looper is vastly better than Brick or TBB in this regard. Otherwise, it's a plothole fest, just like his other efforts.<br /><br />Two stars for the actors, who deserved better. Won't see another of Johnson's. Don't fall for the hype. Looper isn't good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey! Watch it. You won't be sorry. The acting, storyline, scenery and costumes are all excellent. My husband even tolerates it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I can relate to this book,as I actually had a spiritual experience simular to this when I was a young boy. The fact that the writer makes a statement in the book that he says  unlike dreams that you forget in a short period of time this kind of experiance will stay fresh in your mind for ever, he is so on target with that.  I can say, even if you have not had any kind of  NDE experiance simular to this book reading it will have you thinking about what may lie ahead at the end of your time in this Universe as you enter into a new level of being. I highly recommend reading this book even if you are not a religous or spiritual person, when you finish reading this book you will feel differnt about life now and at the end. The universe and all that's in it could just be the smallest part of life as we can only know it. A hard book to put down.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I rated this book as four star due to the quality of the character development and the unusual plot that the author created.  Mr. Riggs was working overtime on this one.
B008BF9ZFM|4.0|Although this book was rated by Amazon to be good for young children, it is more suited to ages 8 and up. It describes a variety of people out fishing, some funny, some just ordinary folk. The scansion isn't strong, but the rhyme is fine. The book would be better if illustrated. It would make a fine oral interpretation.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|could have more options but the ones it has is ok. pretty much same as the other photo apps. it's ok
B005XZHQKY|3.0|The video is not clear enough. Mostly are in shades of blue. It is not as impressive as i expect.
1400082773|4.0|I enjoyed the story, especially the part where Barack returns to his roots.  I thought the first half of the book was a bit slow in parts
B007I1QUYE|4.0|I like the video quality. the story and the performances are great! The special effects are amazing. I am happy to this as part of my collection.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Finally a game that is fun yet challenging. and i must say it is also addictive. been playing this game all day. i even paid oor an unlock. if i was u i would most definately get this game. cantvwait tontry anew version already!!!! two thumbs up
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I see and keep up with everyone in twitter ....cant complain about this product ...plus its free....if you want it get it its safe and good...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Recommendation for this book is beyond words, if  you are a open minded person and are open to new experiences
B004I744AS|5.0|Very good product ...easy to look up and very helpful ...its very easy to understand and search ...plus its free ....recommend everyone to get it...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I recommend this book ti everyone who is open to new things and is totally open top different things and experiences
0802798225|5.0|I read this book in a couple of days I loved it so much. I was so sad when I finished it because I really fell in love with the characters.<br />I was reluctant to read this at first because I thought it would be one of those stereotypical teenage Romeo and Juliet kind of stories, but it was so much more interesting than that. I love how the girl, Brittany, appears to be a typical, prissy, flawless girl, but she's so far from it. And Alex's background of a family history in a gang is so intriguing because I haven't read anything else like that. I thought it would be a very predictable story, but it's not, you're really hanging on the edge.<br /><br />Oh, and it might help to have a Spanish dictionary nearby because Alex frequently uses Spanish phrases. You'll get the gist of the story even if you don't know exactly what he's saying, but I always like to know.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Definitely worth the 5 stars. Many books seem to have quite a bit of filler-  even some of Gaiman's stuff, so I was expecting the same. Good lord, was I caught off-guard. It's completely packed. Every single part of the book just fits, and it's one hell of a storyline to fit into. As an atheist, Gaiman's take on gods was enlightening & a really refreshing change from the rather omnipresent Christianity of the world. Kudos, Mr. Gaiman, and thanks for the trip.
1594744769|5.0|This book was so great! I loved the old photographs drawings and letters included, it was a nice break from reading, but they tie into the story so well. I love creepy stories and there were times when I'd be a little scared or uncomfortable being alone reading it at night, but I loved that about this book! It's so exciting and creative; there is no other book like it. Just read it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I hope the movie follows the death accordingly out of respect to the authors imagination. The gore shouldn't be hidden behind some PG movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|For the first time in years I've found a book I could not put down.  I finished it in one afternoon.  Don't skip a word in the beginning of the book.  What you learn will ultimately bring all of the characters to life - especially the animals.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I give this game 5 stars because it is simply awesome. For those who have heroes of ruin for the 3Ds  or if you like world of warcraft I recommend this game.

B000002UA9|5.0|This was a good price and the item arrived on time. Description was accurate and I enjoy listening to it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed the story, and the subconscious and her inner diva are funny  and likeable ...however the rest of the characters bear strong resemblances the to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight saga.
0393327345|5.0|That's what it was. The experience of reading this book was a single moment of perfection. No more, no less.<br /><br />Delving into the mind of Chuck Palahniuk was a wonderful, mind-blowing experience. His writing is simple, easy to read, refreshing and gets you straight to the point. He doesn't need to sugarcoat it, but is straightforward and says it like it is. I find it impressive that Fight Club is his debut novel as that sets the standard quite high, and seeing how the movie (which I had watched way before reading the book) had stayed very true to the novel proves to me what a great author he is, as it is a rare occurrence for a filmmaker to follow the events and even lines in the book that closely.<br /><br />In brief, the book centers on an insomniac protagonist, who is finding it harder to cope with work, people, home and life. In the midst of this numb daze that has become his life, he meets Tyler Durden, who gives him a new perspective on life and makes it a lot more interesting. With this new forged friendship, they invent \\"Fight Club\\" and the eight rules are created. The fighting wasn't important, it was the rules that changed everything. The rules that made things get out of control and created chaos until the very last breath-taking page.<br /><br />This is a dark novel filled with satiric humour. Palahniuk looks at society and laughs in its face, sometimes spitting in its face. It shows absolutely no fear, but keeps you at the edge of your seat until you are presented with a shocking finish.<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk deserves to be placed along with other significant writers, and this being my first book for him, I am now looking forward to reading Choke and Diary. I love that his style of writing is just so easy to read, and you could go through it quickly without it taking away anything from the story.<br /><br />\\"Really what I was writing was just The Great Gatsby, updated a little. It was 'apostolic' fiction - where a surviving apostle tells the story of his hero. There are two men and a woman. And one man, the hero, is shot to death.\\" - Chuck Palaniuk on Fight Club.<br /><br />Absolute perfection.story of his hero. There are two men and a woman. And one man, the hero, is shot to death.\\" - Chuck Palaniuk on Fight Club.<br /><br />Absolute perfection.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I am not sure I understand why, but this game is very addictive. It is definitely worth downloading for free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game really has me hooked its like I cant stop playing uhhhh!!!!! amazing this game is totally worth it!! :)
B0014KFV6I|4.0|Loved this album in my youth and am now loving it again.  She's a class act!  Take a trip down memory lane.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love Season 1 but Season 2 was AMAZING!!!! The twist and turns of every episode kept me glue to the TV and not knowing what to expect.  I don't know how they plan to top Season 2 but I can't wait for the next season and hope to see the some of the actors from the previous seasons take on new roles.
B0090SI4KG|4.0|Good 1st movie for Arnold. I was surprised I was expecting lots of cheesy lines and Arnold doing everything but it was pretty real and they joked about his age. He used his deputies. This was a team effort. By the way this was a commercial for the corvette. I was not complaining what a sweet ride. I recommend this .
B003L16FAE|1.0|Like others have reviewed my copy of Predator does not play... in fact it seems to be a completely blank disc... how does something seemingly this widespread slip through quality control.  I am now currently Predatorless.
B00B19DMUE|1.0|This was extremely disappointing. Not the least bit scary. It was too much focused on the father & his story. Not the little girl. And she hardly did anything while she was possessed. The movie was a Snooze fest with really cheesy moments.  The exorcism in the hospital at the end was a total joke.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|About just what I wanted words words i i i i i i i i i i i i i
B007B6VOG0|4.0|This is one of the BEST New Rock group out today! The whole album is simply fantastic! And at this price It's a great deal!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|great cd, ive listened to it a million times already and im still not sick of it, good music for work :)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was a great second book in the Ender Quintet! I remember as a kid wishing there was a second book to the first (I had no idea this existed, and my library was very limited), so a few weeks ago when I discovered there WAS, I was very excited! It certainly didn't disappoint me!
B005LAII62|3.0|Paranorman, is a film that truly stands out along with all the Pixar and Dreamworks family films. It is a film that bends the rules with its style of story telling and cast of characters. To sum it all up it is The Sixth Sense for children. It is a story that actually delivers a powerful message about knowing that it is ok if you are different than everyone else.<br /><br />The positives in this film are the tributes to horror films of the 1980s and the jokes that were thrown in for the adult appeal. Also, being that it is stop motion shows that this style of film making is far from dead. As a matter of fact it is a style that was used many times in 2012 and it shows major signs of strength and improvement in a world of film making dominated by computers. However, the film is far from perfect as far as story, but it does keep the view entertained and apparently it got some Oscar nods so there was obviously something done right here.<br /><br />Paranorman is worth seeing at least once and it is definitely a film that can start a huge trend in animation. Like the film stresses you can't be a hero, by being normal.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to check my Facebook from my Kindle Fire. It is a great app, and does exactly what it's supposed to do. No complaints.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|The world of vampires in film has been forever stained since the release of the Twilight series. The world of vampires no longer includes action and just plain coolness. However while Dark Shadows is not one of the grand vamp films of old Tim Burton still manages to give me something that makes me smile.<br /><br />Dark Shadows is not a great film, but if you enjoy Tim Burton films and all his wacky characters then this is a film you will find fun, very witty and just Tim Burtony. Johnny Depp, Michelle Phiepher and the rest of the cast deliver and Chloe Mortez along with Eva Green definitely shine in this one. It's got a few strong links to the old television show, but it really is Tim Burtons' own take and he just does what he does best.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the eBay app for Android. It use it all the time to list items from my Kindle and from my phone. Way easier than using the browser version!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great movie! It's got a little of something for everyone and a good bit of drama to boot! It is definitely worth watching!
B002ZG99TK|5.0|this is a wonderful movie - thankfully not violent, but has you on the edge of your seat. A man against machine movie with so much more!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Extremely readable, yet historically accurate. I'm not a history buff, but I really enjoyed it. It was awfully long, though!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is fresh, funny, and charming. The actors individually are excellent and together are a tremendous ensemble. Having seen many of these together in other endeavors, it is clear they play well off each other.

B0017O1MIM|5.0|Full disclosure: I was taken to see this film at the age of 4 on it's original release and I was never quite the same again :)<br />5 stars for a beautiful restoration of Robert Harris' 89 restoration. I didn't expect the 4k scrub up could bring out such detail from a 50 year old (but 70mm).<br />I was amazed to see individual grains of sand sparkling on dunes from the suns reflection. The desert scenes now have a magical, alien aura for the strange man in a strange land. No CGI here folks, it was all painstakingly photographed in difficult conditions. I understand that the restorers were even able to correct errors on the celuloid created by heat warping of the original negative, so anyone who buys this disk will see &#34;Lawrence&#34; as it was never seen before.<br />Some nice new extras, my favourite being an interview with the sadly, now retired O'Toole hisself.<br />For those of you who have never seen this masterpiece of cinema and who dont suffer from 21st century A.D.D. you are in for a real treat. A thoughtful, intelligent, relevant but above all - poetic arc of triumph, failure, ennui, hubris and the nature of humanity.<br />Food for thought, entertaining and enlightening, exciting, tragic, comic and I'm almost out of superlatives.<br />A film for the ages, Essential for fans and people who haven't seen it yet!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but it is not the best book I ever read. I loved Harold's journey and a lot of the people he met. Another thing I enjoyed was the changing of Maureen's character, because at first I hated her but begin to grow fond of her and Rex. The only problem I had with the book is that it gets repetitive. He loses faith he gains faith, it goes like that at least 3 times in the book. The book also features a good plot twist about Harold's son that I do not want to spoil. I highly recommend this book.
078322740X|4.0|Always loved Goldie in comedies she's so cute  and funny and pair her up with Steve Martin and what a crazy ride!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you are a horse lover like me get this game you can get more horses in it to<br /><br />It has many different things in there<br />R
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing!  I liked the fact that it wasn't your typical teenage love story. The story was a little on the dark side in my opinion but I could not put the book down!  I would definitely recommend this book.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|A little bit of a fan I love her in the beginning but too many bad words dont mind the freedom of speech but she needs to realize the youngy still follow her.
B0085YNML2|3.0|It's fun for a while. Decent puzzle like game. Kind of like Cut the Rope in my opinion. I got it for free, I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B000IEXVCC|3.0|The two main female characters strike quite a pair in this moive. Continually.  Aphroditic and erotic, this movie is literally a blast from the past! .
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|It's a fun game, but I think my phone is just to slow to handle it. It has a lot of lag time, which resulted in me stopping playing, but I had a lot of fun with it while it lasted.
B000IFQLLY|4.0|There are a lot of great songs on here.  I'm not a huge fan of the earliest Depeche Mode, and I only like a few of their newer singles.  For me, Violator is the pinnacle of their music.  This is a good collection to have if you want a few of the singles from their music collection without owning the entire albums.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I use avast! on my computer, and have had really good luck with it, so I am using it on my android phone now as well. No problems so far :)
B00886XQO0|5.0|I give it a &#34;love it&#34; rating because I do, in fact, love it.  However, I didn't pay $299 for it and I wouldn't.  I got it on sale for closer to $180 which seems appropriate.  The audio fidelity is fine, but it feel like wireless audio is still a function/convenience over fidelity thing.  At any rate, Black Ops II sounds great when I have these on and the family is left in peace even when I'm playing early in the morning or late at night.
B000957O82|5.0|I actually purchased this as a gift for my sister because she had borrowed mine and was upset when I took it back. Fun, feel good movie.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I am not usually a fan of re-makes or re-telling of old movies.  But this one is actually very good.  The special effects are of the charts.  This movie is a must-have for sci fi and special effects junkies!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is so amazing! I really love the graphics and the characters!  there's is even a bigger demon monkey than before! I love the obstacles you put on there! this app is so epic and amazing! keep up the good work!
0525953728|5.0|I got this book delivered to me the first day it was release and I immediately started to read and did not put it down until I was done.  An amazing account from the eyes of one soldier that was part of the team that killed Osama.  Anyone who is a military fanatic will love this book!!!  I have always given so much respect to the military personnel that are in the Spec Op community but after reading this book, you guys are truly the unsung heroes!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft PE, Computer Ed and XBox 360 Ed. Great app. Very cheap. All mobs are loaded into the game except for Enderman, Silverfish, Blaze, Slime, Magma Cubes, Ghast. Zombies need to really break down doors,  but armor might be coming in 0.7.0! It is coded in already. Yay!
