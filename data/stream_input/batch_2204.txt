B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy way to kill time waiting on the bus or what ev. I love that it is kinda realistic. The horses are pretty and the unicorns are awesome.
0547884591|5.0|Although this book will take a lot longer than 4 hours to get through it, already it is well worth the investment.  Learning how Tim Ferriss learns is incredibly invaluable.  I am a complete believer in the 4-Hour franchise.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Bruno mars, on a vocal & musical level is a rare standout in a sea of mediocrity.  Why he has to ruin it with trashy lyrics and foul language is beyond me.  I'd give it 4 stars or better if not for that!  Gorilla could have been playful, but now it's disgusting.  Treasure is actually not explicit at all, love that track, but the unnecessary sound bite at the beginning blemishes it with an f-bomb I will be editing off.  The other offender is Natalie....again it's a few poorly chosen lyrics that ruin what could be great....
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved it! Wonderful characters in this book come alive.  The emotions brought forth during the book are many; outrage, hope, love, etc.  Makes you understand the forces of evil and neglect that can harm young innocents and the kindness, compassion, understanding and love required to heal.
B00B6SI7TG|4.0|I like it, very different for them, but the mixes kind of emphasize what is wrong with DM from Playing the Angel forward.  I love love them, I have everything, but Universe came closer to where they should be...they need a producer that will help them rediscover what MADE them...kind of like what Ronson did for Duran!  Boys, trying new things is cool, but it's ok to sound like Depeche!  Records like Exciter & Ultra, for me, did a great job of staying true without being a repetition of past glories, Angel forward....not as much.  Hopeful the new record nails it, but with the same producer...(?)
0385738765|5.0|My step son loves to read so i thought how bout a series to get him into..well the idea went well..hook line and sinker.  He cant put the book down and even said they should adapt a film from these books
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|To have such a great cast, the movie did not develop the characters very well, and their relationships were confusing, especially for someone who has not read the book. The stage-set approach was interesting but often distracting and detracted from the story. By the end of the movie, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I bought this movie for my son at the time 2yrs old for his easter basket. He fell in love with the movie and loves drums so the fact  that  the bunny played the drums  really caught his eyes. He watched this movie over and over.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|You know a movie stinks when all of a sudden you're in the middle of a scene and there is no explanation, either previously or forthcoming, as to why the main characters are there. In Skyfall there are too many of these scenes. Bond is all of a sudden at a high powered Chinese dinner party...Why? Who is there? The entire plot is driven by chance. I stopped watching the movie it was so bad.<br />I loved Casino Royale
B000MV9026|4.0|I purchased this movie for my 3yr old, it was a great deal. He has yet to watch it, but I am sure he will love it once he does. I have watched it myself and thought  it was a cute kids movie.

B000FC2L1E|4.0|It is exciting read again about jamie and claire......specially whith the expectation of them together again. But there is too many distractions when the only thing that you really want to know is their story

B009ZABU7S|4.0|As you should know, English is a very hard language to learn, hence it is always changing. This should be useful for anyone who needs it.The problem is it is already in English, so if you don't know English, it isn't always the best app.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book kept my interest.  It seems an insightful exploration of mental illness and the possibility of recovery.  That the events take place in the context of sports fandom ties a familiar theme with a subject not often found in popular fiction.  I chose it because of the popularity of the movie, but stayed with it because it is a well told and sympathetic story.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I hope the creators of this app are reading this because they need to fix the glitches. It keeps crashing and or freezing my kindle fire. A great app, but it still needs a little work. I MEAN A LOT OF WORK!<br />GLITCHES ARE EVERYWHERE IN THIS GAME!!!! DO NOT INSTALL!!!!!!!!!!! [[ASIN:B00B2V66VS Temple Run 2]]
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a very impressive follow-up of book one. The beginning left me wondering if it was worth my time. Thankfully, I stuck it through, because the second half of the book was really awesome.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The beginning of this book was and action packed. As the story moved past initial zombie creation it slowed down and started to really make you think about the consequences of a world wide \\"plague.\\"  I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because with so many well written characters it became difficult to keep them straight. A list of characters with short descriptions would have been useful.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent read! Very captivating throughout entire book. Very realistic and relatable. One of those kind of books you read in one day. I'm eager we to see if the movie is as good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really fun game!!! Get it you won't regret it :) It is fun you just have to do missions for the horse it's a lot of fun :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm not very good at the game and I'm not sure what I'm doing most of the time but I'm having lots fun trying to get through the many levels.  I'd recommend it to everyone.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Excellent video.  I think it is great.  Everyone should see it.<br />Farmers understand the dangers of GMOs and chemicals on the land and poverty of quality of our food much better than Lawyers, CFOs, Wall Streeters, Senators and Congressman do.<br />Anne E. Bingham (Bio-Dynamic Farmer, Salem, Ct. 06420)<br />By the way, BioDynamic Agriculture is the antidote to these problems.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I think it was easy to be pulled into the book because I am familiar with many of the landmarks where the novel was set. I enjoyed the writing style overall although I found some of the characters and dialog<br />Seemed awkward, forced or inconsistent with the characters as they develop. The book has some very interesting and unexpected surprises. Read it to the very end. I look forward to the author's next novel.it is very unusual for me to stay up late because I couldn't put a book down but this one had that effect.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie can do no wrong.  Love this CD and listen to it many times.  It kept me company on a very long drive, which I really appreciated.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Epic piece of book, still relevant in our times. It's got a nice mix of many things, much more than you expect.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love Pink anyway.  Listened to this frequently on a long car ride from Florida to Texas and back.  And many times since.  Really enjoy it, she is amazing.
B005LAII08|5.0|I love Brave in the Five Disc Ult. Coll. Edition...it gives the family several more options for enjoying the movie
0062082353|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I shared it with a friend and also my sister, and both really liked it as well.
B00BKVK0MG|5.0|Love this show. I need to know when they actually post the New epsidoes, its killing me. Does anyone have an exact time as to when the epsisodes get posted for instant video purchase??? please dont reply with, \\"UMM... I think its like the next day or something.\\" you will sound like an idiot and I will have not been helped.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had to adjust to the diary-style in the beginning but after a few chapters became hooked. One moment Amy was a saint, the next she was manipulated and abused. The ending was a surprise. This book takes the reader on an interesting ride ... and an unexpected one. I recommend it.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|I don't regret watching it. The effects were good. The actors were good. The story..eh. All in all it was a good flick. Sorry for a short review.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Perhaps I was not too thrilled about the topic--alcoholism--rather than the movie.  Or I felt that the alcoholism of the pilot should have been dealt with separately from the heroics involved in the landing of the aircraft.  Something just fell short for me in completely enjoying this movie.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|Not that I have to hate it see how THE series of the past are better than this one that is called a waiters POPULAR FIRST book isn't that bad you know
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have not missed a Bond movie, and find them to be a wonderful escape.  This movie gives us a glimpse into Bond's past and into the hard decisions M has had to make over her career.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Boring cinematography.  Unauthentic costumes.  Predictable overly-modernized plot line that isn't true to history.  Totally unnecessary morose-divorced-dad-Affleck side story.  Egotistical pats on the back of brave, brave Hollywood.  I didn't empathize with a single character, except maybe the Iranians waiting in the American Embassy waiting room as protestors loomed.  In the era of Mad Men, I expect a more authentic and rich look back at the past, without the need for **SPOILER** police cars chasing an airplane down the runway as it takes off.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Great movie, restored edition was very nice. Never gets old a beautifully told story from a excellent author. Would recommend
B00594XOZU|5.0|nice . . . a p p it is awesome m m m m m m m m m m
B009UZBLSG|4.0|This works perfectly when connected to my Nexus 4. Unfortunately, the cable on this adapter is quite short and quite stiff, making it very difficult to keep connected to my Nexus 4. Additionally, the excessive size of the micro-USB plug block causes this to only barely fit into the Nexus 4 when a bumper is on it, leading to even more infuriating disconnects while in use.<br /><br />If this had 1 foot to 3 foot (soft) cable and a smaller block on the plug, it would be the perfect product - one could connect the micro USB power and HDMI cable out of sight, and have only a micro-USB plug to worry about. Instead, one must gingerly handle the phone wile it is connected, which is difficult, when it is attached to a spiderweb of cables only a couple inches of stiff cable from the port on the bottom of the phone.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Homeland is a great series to watch, and much better than the usual nightly trash on tv.  Riveting, exciting, suspenseful, it makes you think if there is a Manchurian Candidate out there?
B008GFI4KY|5.0|This being the Darkness new album I was expecting great things. Love it!!! This CD came in standard packaging and plays great. They said 'new' and it was a new copy.
B00B3N4FTK|5.0|This movie never got the acclaim it deserves. The consequences of illegal abortion are examined as well as some efforts to deal with the problem. The best part is that it all takes place during WWII, showing just how well we have not solved the problem. It could be updated to 2013 without any damage to the plot line.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm not sure how to even rate this book, it's very unique. I finished in two days, I couldn't put it down. I was hooked from the beginning and I had to know how it ended. However, I hated the characters. Both main characters are egotistical jerks and I had a hard time relating to either of them. And then the ending. OH, the ending!! I hated it!<br /><br />If the mark of a good book is that you can't stop reading it and it stays with you for days after you've finished; then this is a very good book.<br /><br />However, if the mark of a good book is to root for one of the characters, to have a believable plot, and to be able to imagine yourself as one of the characters, this book is terrible.<br /><br />I haven't decided either way yet.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I always seem to come back to this game, as it has goals to win, and lots of fun. :)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book kept me reading the entire day.  It had some very interesting situations and how they were handled made me spend time really thinking about.  I gave it four stars for the story and would recommend it to someone who wants to hear more about mental health issues .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't often need a calculator on my Kindle, but every once in a while, I like to check things. This is a great little app for that ... nothing too demanding and not very sophisticated, but for an everyday, easy to use thing, it's perfect.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|The &#34;Children of the Corn&#34; eyes on Amy Adams and the creepy music throughout....add these to a plot that seems to build into a better understanding of cult behavior..but it doesn't.<br /><br />Since there were nominations for this movie, etc, I assume there are many who found this movie to be essential. Not me.
B0055S348W|1.0|At the time that I purchased this it showed in the app store as compatible with my Kindle Fire HD.  The product description also did not contain any disclaimers.<br /><br />While it works better than some of the other apps I've tried the advertised ability to print from Google account services (Gmail, etc.) DOES NOT WORK ON THE KINDLE FIRE HD.  This is the response I got from Dnyamix tech support: KF uses a separate app to access your email, PrinterShare is unable to read your account information, access Gmail, Google Docs or Google Cloud Print.  We are currently working on bringing the full range of PrinterShare features to Kindle Fire users.<br /><br />When I asked what the time frame was for correcting this they said:  I am afraid that we cannot say with confidence ETA of the needed update.<br /><br />Unfortunately I did not read the review from February 19, 2012, which says the same thing.  Since they are repeating what they said a year ago it appears there is no intention to fix this.  Otherwise there would be a disclaimer about the fire in the product description.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|love the show =) I just now got into watching it and I see why everyone liked it =) =)

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book, it's action packed, and it has the very interesting insights of Chris, his adventures misadventures and the narrative really takes you to the war zone. I liked it very much and makes me feel sorry about the death of this stand up guy.

1439127727|5.0|At face, &#34;The Presidents Club&#34;  is a survey of how 20th century US presidents have called upon (or not) their predecessors when they needed help, but it is much more than that.  It is a backstage history of the century through the lens of the Oval Office.  Know why Bush was so hellbent on invading Iraq, even before 9/11?  One explanation is here, as well as why it wasn't made public.  Know why Richard Nixon's perfidy regarding Johnson's Viet Nam war talks did not sink his chances to become president in 1968?  It's all here.  So is the interesting reminder that Herbert Hoover, today regarded as the architect of the Great Depression, and one of the worst presidents ever, was actually highly regarded and admired to the end of his life.  The book reveals how presidential politics turns strange bedfellows into close friendships--Truman and Hoover, and Clinton and Nixon, for instance--and it also presents each president in an objective, balanced way, highlighting both warts and beauty marks.  Readers who either idolize or detest any particular president will probably take issue with some of the book, since nobody comes off totally clean (Ford comes the closest), but the authors have done voluminous research to support their arguments.  The two most fascinating portraits are those of Nixon and Carter.  Nixon is presented as a man whose paranoid solipsism and pathetic desire for attention nearly ruined every good idea and noble goal he ever had (not to mention nearly ruining the country), while Carter is depicted as someone who would acquiesce to his intellectual and political superiors if he believed for a second that he had any.  Both, the authors put forth, came close to committing verifiable treason as non-sitting presidents, but were protected by their membership in the Presidents Club (and the fact that their judgments were more often than not right, despite their repeatedly going rogue to prove it).  &#34;The Presidents Club&#34; is a superbly researched, well-written history that, in a strange way, actually makes one come away feeling better about the men who ran the country by according them humanity.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this movie - If I could, I would watch it every day! All the characters are hilarious and the songs they sing are great too.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This is true Bonamassa all the way. My husband loved it and put it on to his Ipod so he can drive and listen.
1401207138|5.0|Been looking for the original version of this classic for months, after having seen the movie. A very nice box which includes the entire book, for a decent price.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|As close as my husband could get to a live concert. He's been a Bonamassa fan for years and loves this CD. Thanks for making it so affordable.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This is one of the best books i ever read. You need to read it. Full of love and romance.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Really helpful and easy to read. Not a hokey self help book but a way to change your thinking in everyday life.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|I am influenced by two things.  First, I had a great dad with daughter movie night that I cherished.  Secondly, it supports my view that you can't judge a book by its cover.  As a Christian believer, this is more important than ever to embrace those who are deemed unacceptable.  Since God can redeem any situation for his glory, we should start with loving people for who they are and not condemn someone because they are different.  The movie itself was a great story about believing in yourself and the good in the world versus the over generalized view of the world.  Add the love for cooking and the creative experience it creates in all of us and you have a winner of a movie.  Well done Disney and Pixar.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I like the sci-fi aspect of this show.  And they tell a decent story as well.  I recommend this show to everyone who likes sci-fi.
0756655307|5.0|I gave this book to my husband and his brother as a gift.  They fell in love with it.  As die hard marvel fans they were like little boys at Christmas.  I also like the pictures and descriptions.  It is a good book for fans or anyone who wants some Marvel information.  It was worth more than what I paid for it.
1419703692|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and the great images. definitely a must own if your a fan of the Chris Nolan Batman films or a batman fan regardless. Talks alot about the production of all 3 movies with some interesting insight. Its a great addition to the movies dvd special features. One of my favorite coffee table books I own!
B0095VPBFY|4.0|Overall not bad, very easy to overclock to 4.1.  Playing games online like RuneScape puts some strain on it because of the high level of detail and rendering. Not too bad for what i'm using it for, but if you plan on doing any more I would advise getting a dedicated graphics card.
B00A2AU0KI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It kept my attention and Clint was funny with his one liners and general grumpy disposition. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is: the hitter that Clint advises against saying he can't hit a curve apparently drops his hands. That's a minor mechanical adjustment, nothing a hitting coach couldn't fix. It wouldn't stop any MLB team from taking him as a top prospect much less cause anyone to get fired.<br />So overall enjoyable but unrealistic and a little predictable, but is worth watching.......enjoy!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is the same as you play on your computer.  Great graphics and just what is needed when you need a break to relax.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I knew a little about Jobs, I think only the essentials. Isaacson knows undoubtedly how to tell us about who Jobs was as possibly one of the forgers of this incredible era that we share, as well as paint him from his human side, in a combination that I rarely saw in a biography. Not only I learned what wonderful things Jobs did during his life but, most important, how big he was making that happen being human and a genius. Definitely a masterpiece that, at the same time, is a living proof of Jobs intelligence deciding to whom choose for writing about his life and realizations.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown's story is amazing from his childhood through adolescents and finally into adulthood an  fatherhood.  His story is amazing and he truly is someone children and adults can look up too.  From the bad times as a teen and young adult to his angelic deeds as a military service member his story is amazing.  From his no quit attitude and his family values he is a true American Hero.  A must read.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Awesome app!!Connects to both of our computers at home wherever we are.<br />Well worth the money to buy this app.

0345404475|4.0|The film ‘Blade Runner’, based upon this novel, has imprinted itself in my consciousness so strongly that I have read the novel ‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?’ three times now to remind me of the original concept and how Dick’s conception of androids was fundamentally different from the replicants of Ridley Scott’s film. Each exists in an alternate reality to the other, an idea that Dick himself might have embraced if he had lived to see the first film adaptation of his work. In the novel, the androids are definitely dangerous but not the invincible superhuman replicants that the film portrays.<br /><br />Dick’s conception of androids is based upon a convincing yet ultimately incomplete verisimilitude to humans. While androids may be able to possess as much intelligence and reasoning capability as humans the one quality in which they are lacking is the ability to empathize. For Dick, this quality is not exclusive to androids—humans can lack humanity as well—but at least androids might be forgiven for their lack in view of the fact that they were designed by humans so, in a sense, they are like Frankenstein’s monster and, therefore, innocent.<br /><br />However, the world of bounty hunting does not work this way. Rick Deckard takes cases that the more experienced hunter Dave Holden either doesn’t want or doesn’t have time for. Eight Nexus-6 androids (the latest and most advanced model) have escaped from their lives of forced labor on an off world colony on Mars and headed back to Earth where they hope to blend in and pass as humans. Holden took out two but was seriously injured by a third, resulting in Deckard taking over the task of retiring the remaining renegades. Deckard gets $1,000 cash for each android removed and hopes to save up enough to buy an organic animal to replace his electric sheep, a poor man’s status symbol, and please his chronically depressed wife.<br /><br />This is a future world of nuclear fallout and densely populated areas in the few regions that the ash has not rendered uninhabitable. Similar to Bradbury’s citizens in ‘Fahrenheit 451’ these people drug themselves into a state of serenity via a device called a mood organ in which they can select a state of mind as if in a psychological buffet. TV programming consists of 23 hour a day programming of Buster Friendly and His Friendly Friends. Buster is a cross between Johnny Carson-style ‘Tonight Show’, complete with career celebrity gadflies like Amanda Werner, and, prophetically, Fox News style yellow journalism. When not indulging in inane chatter with his friendly friends, Buster’s primary occupation is discrediting the reigning religion. Mercerism consists of a virtual reality messiah who enables everyone to feel his pain and, therefore, empathize with everything. Mercerism is Dick’s counterpart to Vonnegut’s Bokononism and it is equally contrived.<br /><br />Deckard’s journey and, by extension, the plot cannot be summarized succinctly other than to say that it is a dizzying day in the life of a bounty hunter who questions all he knows, or thinks he knows, about androids, if the tools he is using to verify their android-icity are even accurate, or if he should be a police-appointed judge and jury deciding on the spot to retire them. He even begins to question his own memories. Does he know for sure that they have not been implanted? He definitely encounters humans who lack empathy and androids who, seemingly, possess something resembling empathy. He even begins to consider that Mercerism might actually have a solid basis in reality apart from the empathy machines that enable millions to follow it and walk away with real blood resulting from virtual blows struck by virtual stones.<br /><br />‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?’ contains multiple potent metaphors for authentic and simulated humanity sprinkled throughout a winding maze of a plot line that has far more twists and turns than a standard ‘bounty hunter going after androids until the last one is exterminated’ linear story would indicate. Although I have only read two of Dick’s novels to date, I suspect that his stories are rarely that straightforward. In his universe everything is always ripe for questioning.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA MADE IN CHINA<br /><br />They feel cheap and Amazon just dropped the price from $99 down to $81. . . .The global market really means producing/copying as cheap as possible.  It is sad to see a well established company like AKG take this route.<br /><br />They sound average--like a $30 pair of headphones.  They are difficult to drive with a mp3 player or other sources; they worked best with my mixer headphone output--it has a dedicated headphone IC with plenty of current capability.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What a wonderful story.  Could not wait to watch Season 3.  Difficult to stop watching.. felt like a couch potato
0817439390|5.0|I have read a large stack of photography books; many from the authors with the strongest following.  A lot of them are good, and several are quite good.  This one is a several cuts above the rest.<br /><br />While it says &#34;with any camera&#34;, and I suppose to some degree that may be true,  I think it is really aimed at someone that has a reasonable good DSLR and a reasonable good grasp of photography, or a willingness to dive in the deep end.  I am far from a being a professional or even a good amateur.  But on the very first page after the introduction, he is already talking about the merits of working in Manual mode.  While still in the first chapter, we are exploring the benefits of doing something other than &#34;auto&#34; for white balance. He does it in a way that makes sense and seems like a small step to take.  And now I am quite comfortable with both of these and many other aspects as well.<br /><br />I literally learned more in this one book, and became comfortable with more new things, than all the other books I have read combined.  Thank you Bryan Peterson.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Loved the series but hated the ending of Season 3... way too sad. I can only hope Season 4 will be up lifting but not sure how that will be possible based on the sad ending of Season 3.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|As others have noted, this movie does provide some really good 3D effects.  I would say 20 to 30+ objects were a good distance out from my TV (LG 3D Real Cinema 3D).  After the movie, the entire family said in almost unison &#34;best 3D movie for effects we've seen so far&#34;.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its one of the best games I ever played but how do you set of TNT I tried putting a stick of fire next to it but nothing happened I don't get it!!!
B00884GR0W|3.0|I love this game but one day it said it was open so I tapped it but nothing happened now I cant play it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|My son and I love playing chess and are now enjoying this game on my Kindle Fire also. I love that it tracks how many you've won and lost, even when playing the computer. My son likes that he can rename the computer.<br /><br />When playing you can set the game board to flip so the current player whose turn it is always sees it from the bottom. Or you can set it to not flip so that you each sit on one side of the kindle. I wish that when set to not flip the pieces were not all oriented to the bottom of the screen. It would be great to turn half of them so we can each see our pieces in the right orientation.<br /><br />That aside the game has a variable difficulty setting which is really helping my son (age 10) to improve his game. When his win/loss ratio gets to be high, he can up the difficulty. All in all it's a fantastic game and the price certainly can't be beat!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I thought I was receiving a Kindle credit that I had earned so I randomly chose this book - I ended up not receiving the credit and therefore spent $3-4 on it. It was amateurish and a bit misguided on what kind of book it was trying to be....that being said I did read the whole story so something in it grabbed me...Not terrible, just not anything particularly special...
0316044695|4.0|The &#34;I love George Bush&#34; theme was tough to swallow at times. Easy to see why this one didn't attract the fury that the Osama Raid book did, they all but polish the TX POTUS' nuts while telling the story. That aside, nice to see a SEAL get some return on his ordeal, come home safe, and be received by a great community. Special Forces rock. The two Tillman books give a slightly different view of the folks running that particular theater.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Is the best way to describe this film. Not memorable, not one I am likely to recommend to anyone, not one I am likely to ever want to see again. It was just OK.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable read. And now I'm about to re-read it since I was so on-the-edge-of-my-seat to unravel the mystery of the cleaning. Great story AND great writing. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and exploring post-apocalyptic worlds.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|HOMELAND was the best series I have ever seen. Can't wait to see season 2 on Amazon! It is the most tense, intriguing, psychologically thrilling story.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Let's stop anguishing over the fact that Rodriguez was virtually unknown in the USA until recently--we have his music now and that's something to celebrate!  This, the better of his two releases, is easily one of the top albums of the early 1970s.  Perhaps there is a tad too much over-production, but the material shines through.  Six stars!
B004UPAIDK|4.0|This was a GRADE A \\"B-Flick\\". My husband and I always enjoy watching good cheesy horror films and this was right on the money. Director Sam Raimi hooked us as fans when he did Xena: Warrior Princess and the Evil Dead franchise starring Bruce Campbell was a dead on.
B00000DI06|5.0|Our choir is doing Requiem and this album was recommended for us to listen to and help us as we learn it. Very beautiful music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There is always a surprise!  It is so nice to have such a quality program such as this to watch!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I am absolutely addicted to the show and never can wait till the next episode. When it comes out on DVD I will buy it in a split second. Just love it!!!
B001NYPTO4|5.0|This is a awesomely great soundtrack. Each song is so beautiful. The price is very reasonable. One of the best soundtrack CDs.
B003L77G06|5.0|Everyone I know of all ages just loves and adores this show!!!!!!!<br />Great cast<br />Won many awards<br />Constant laughter<br />Simply wonderful
0060254920|5.0|It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I chose this rating because I really like the story. I like how she always brought back the memories from previous books. But what I didn't like, was all of the cliff hangers. I don't think many people actually wait to read the next chapter the next night. I was not able to stop, so I always just read the first paragraph of the next chapter. Hopefully, the author comes up with more series with intense suspense.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I liked how it was generational and suspensful right until the end. I highly recommend this book:)

B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Like every other role he's taken on, Denzel Wahington's performance here is extraordinary. The screenplay too is simply and painfully true.

B009VMN3RA|3.0|Her mother may have claimed this memoir is &#34;fiction,&#34; but if so, the daughter is as good a storyteller as her mom.  This is a tale of an exotic childhood, a life with a charismatic father, but one with a dark side, a tempestuous relationship with a famous mother, and a survivor's adulthood.  I wouldn't call it a &#34;Mommy Dearest&#34; as some have.  Even though Shirley MacLaine obviously made choices that favored her ambition over motherhood, she was hardly more than a kid when daughter, Sachi, was born, was on the cusp of her fame, and at least some of those choices are very understandable.  Plus, there are a lot of loving memories included in this recollection. Sachi spent a month at Christmas and Easter with her mother as well as the summer school vacations.  From the  perspective of an adult with a consuming career, this may have seemed a generous amount.  From the perspective of a toddler and little girl, one can imagine how long the times in between would have felt.  Even if her mother were not a show business icon, the time with her father is almost more fascinating, though.
B001684L0A|5.0|It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena
B001NHNG64|5.0|I am officially a Jack Reacher creature!  I am on my 6th book now, Tripwire, and have loved every book I've read so far, which is The Enemy, The Affair, both prequels, and then the Killing Floor and Die Trying! I also read the Second Son which is a short story. Die Trying was a little difficult to understand at first because there were 2 different plot lines going alternately and eventually they tied in together.  This story was full of suspense and murder as well as a love story.  If you are not a Jack Reacher fan yet, I dare you to pick up one of his books and not become one!
B00447G29S|5.0|It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena

B008XG1X18|5.0|If I could give it ten stars, I would. I love it.!!!!!!!<br />I tell everyone I know how much fun it is.  I also let them<br />know that it can be additive and interesting.

B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Well worth the $$ and the wait!!!! A must own for the dark Knight fans.  Worth the 20 year wait for this classic to come to life!
B0097JYVAU|5.0|I literally could not stop reading this. Despite the normally dry topic, this is an easy read for anyone width little or no understanding of statistics.
B001BSH11G|5.0|I Have An Ipod  Of Vinyl Only And This Will Add To It<br />Sure To Be One Of The Best Sounding Of All
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas present to my 10 year old daughter and my husband, daughter and myself love it.  Whether or not it's about her ended relationships or not, the beat, words and music are great and fun to listen to, especially in the car.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Just as good as first two. My girlfriend loves everything with Will Smith renting this definitely scores points!<br />Its a movie you may want to watch more than once so i would purchase rather than rent if you got the money
B003AYMZO2|5.0|This series is absolutely incredible!!!!! Every season is great.  The best thing is to have access to all the seasons so you can watch back to back episodes and get caught up before the final season ends this summer.  You won't be able to leave the screen.  It is dark reality thrown in with humor and imagination to make an explosive ongoing story.  A must see for adults.
0811870987|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is a bird-lover.  She went nuts over it.  I liked it so much that I plan to buy myself a copy.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This series is absolutely incredible!!!!! Every season is great.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy.  I thought it was a teenagers book, but was very much surpirsed as how I did not want to put the books down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is very good for at home or traveling to be able to find out what the radar/weather is in your area or area traveled
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Skyfall is a sold installment to the Bond series.  There are certainly spots that I think are sort of out of place, and don't really fit, but overall; it's a good bond movie for sure.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|have done everything to try to get this to load but sadly it wont. I will try again at a later date maybe even change my one star rating. I have several friends with Ipads that rave about this game. I saw it available for my Kindle Fire and was super excited. It shows that downloads 121.5 Mb and then it crashes and I go back in it does it again it loads crashes and keeps doing the same thing. Please fix this issue I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park franchise and have been waiting for this game.
B00280LYIC|4.0|4 and a half stars<br />Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Beautifully directed and acted, Life of Pi  is a fantastical journey of the mind of heart--and one that keeps you glued to the screen.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Such an amazing and heart wrenching book. I highly recommend it but be aware some parts are hard to read.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I had not heard of Macklemore until a friend sent me their Tiny Desk concert on NPR. I had heard Thrift Shop before, but had not known who the artist was.  After seeing the Tiny Desk concert, I purchased The Heist [Deluxe] here on Amazon. Nearly every on on this 18 track album is great. Some songs are funny (Thrift Shop, Castle) and many of them are very lyrically profound, relevant, meaningful, and definitely worth a listen.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|The season brought old characters and new to life. The story lines were real to life. The series has brought an understanding of the period of time
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I loved this game. Graphics are great and there are short explainations as to the goal of each puzzle. A lot of the negative reviews based on paying an additional charge are no longer valid, as the developer has made this free. You will still get a prompt asking you if you want to purchase it, but there's no extra charge. So so glad I played despite all the negative feedback. Excellent game!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Definitely written better then 50 Shades.<br />This is the 2nd book in the series. I thought it was better that the first. \\"Bared to you\\".  Which i was disappointed in, but still enjoyed it enough to read the 2nd one. Looking forward the the 3rd one coming out this summer.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely, it was one of those books you keep thinking about, it tackles a difficult subject and makes you consider different ways of looking at it
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi has a wicked sense of humour. Although this is a space opera, and all about fighting aliens, it also is whimsical and funny at times.<br /><br />Humanity is out and about in the universe and establishing colonies anywhere it can. However, there are other races that have the same idea and just like in real estate it's all about location, location, location. Every race is after the same great planets, and they are willing to do whatever it takes.<br /><br />In a turn around to the traditional sending  the young men off to fight,  Scalzi envisions a system where when you reach 75 you join up and go off planet to fight. You are regenerated as a younger physically enhanced version of your self but still have your memories of the first 75 years of your life.<br /><br />Technology off Earth is superior in all respects to what you can get on Earth, however that's just a rumour as after you sign up for military duty you can never return to Earth.<br /><br />Great action scenes, great humour, great character development and overall a GREAT read.<br /><br />Highly recommended as is Scalzi's latest Redshirts, another irreverent space opera novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting you must try it its kinds like temple run they both are my fav games on my kindle
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I admit that it took me several good listens to realize what an absolutely beautiful album this is.  It takes a little while for the songs to seep down into your mind, but once they do, man are you in for a gorgeous ride!  The best track for me was The Eastern Sky. This has to be one of the most moving love songs Justin Hayward has ever written (and that's really saying something when you consider he composed Nights in White Satin, Story In Your Eyes, I Know You're Out There Somewhere and many other classics).  But this isn't the only gem on the album; there are many more wonderful tracks.  Justin Hayward has a knack for creating the most moving and exquisite melodies and his unmistakable voice is just magnificent throughout the album.  The bluegrass-tinged songs are most unexpected from Justin, but they work and are very enjoyable.  The techno tracks at the end are very well done and a lot of fun! This album is at times heart-achingly beautiful, surprising at other times and just a wonderful effort from a very talented man.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A very challenging game that gets your mind working. I enjoy playing it. It is appropriate for older children and adults.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|When I sat down with Quiet, I expected great things. I had heard a few reviews, and looked forward to reading it. Quiet was everything that it was promised to be. Susan Cain created an incredible book that really helped me to better understand a facet of myself. For the longest time, every Myers Briggs Personality test I would take showed me as a very strong introvert and I knew that was where I got my comfort zone from. As I went through college and started in the working world, things started to change. In an effort to be accepted, I forced myself to start being more extroverted, or as I called myself, an extroverted introvert, or as Susan Cain calls it, an Omnivert.<br /><br />Quiet is a book that shows it's okay to be an introvert, it is okay to do be who you are comfortable being. It teaches how introverts and extroverts can relate. In short, Quiet is a Clarion call for understanding the unique strengths that being an introvert and being an extrovert can bring. It goes over the history and how the US has been focused on the 'Salesperson' mentality, and why that was important.<br /><br />In short, Quiet should be read by individuals of all backgrounds, but especially for those who are in a position of leadership or who identify as being an introvert. All too often we fail to reach our potential because we are too afraid, or we see a 'glass ceiling' of sorts. It is okay to be quiet, it is okay to be shy, and those characteristics can bring a great strength.<br /><br />I am happy to give this book 5/5 stars for quality of information. This did not read like one of the normal 'dull' self-help/understanding books, instead it was gripping, innovative. I have already recommended this to my family and friends, and will certainly recommend it to more.<br /><br />I received this book for free as part of a Blogging for Books program operated by WaterBrook Multnomah in exchange for my honest review.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|There are two films here against which all others are frequently measured.<br />This was too inexpensive to pass up and a must for any film lovers library.<br />The restoration work was needed and did make a difference.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|What can I say? It was so real that I went and got my diving gear just in case I needed it. I have bought some small fish to feed my friends upon my next viewing. It was informative, alive and once in a while made me duck. So much fun that I even quacked up!
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|This movie was: well acted, well paced and well restrained. It could have gone a number of easy directions but it controlled itself and it paid off. I don't recommend many films but hti is an easy call.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is for my granddaughter. She wants to collect every season. Right now she only has the first 2. thanks
B00000IZOR|1.0|We bought this for our granddaughter for Christmas.  This phone is unusable.  The cord on the receiver is so short that a child can't even get it up to their ear.  The pull cord is short also.  A waste of money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i gotta say this series is so much better than the 1st one. 3rd person and awesome new characters. cussing horse? hiarious.
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|What can I say....wife wanted it..(damn you Channing Tatum LOL)....not a great story but she's happy so there you go.  Item was well packaged and arrived quickly.
B00AU15HPC|2.0|I met Justin in 1968 in San Francisco and have been to 55 Moody Blues concerts since.<br /><br />The reviews here that defined the Good, Bad and Ugly about this album are straight on.<br /><br />One or two great songs, but yikes.  Nashville Moody Bluegrass with Jed and the Clampetts.<br /><br />And the EuroTecho Crap at the end.  (Yes, I get it. Cute story...but still).<br /><br />So in the diction of Robert Parker's Wine Reviews:<br /><br />View From the Hill  98<br />Moving Mountains  93<br />Songwriter  85<br />Night Flight  78<br />Western Sky  71<br /><br />But still better than 95% of what is out there today.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|A co-worker recommended that I listen to Mr. Porter and I'm glad I took his advice. Great voice, nice production and an overall wonderful album. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes vocal jazz!
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Bought a Kindle Fire about six months aga.  Bought about 6 books.  Now it will not recharge.  Tried to reset.  Can get help.  They say they will call back but never do.  My books and info is lost.  Please figure out how to  contact these people before you buy.  I'll do the buying of these types of devices at a store, where I can get a hold of someone that can help.
B00AGE20ZI|4.0|Yes this movie was wonderful, my daughter asked me to watch it with her as it was one of her favorites. If you like seeing movies that take you back to a time when values and morals were different this one will transport you!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love it!  Not a bad track on this cd.  Never gets old listening too.  Have it on repeat.  Great Buy!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I love hidden object games, but this one is way too complicated.  And, the screens are dark adn the objects may blend into the dark background in some cases.  I see no help buttons, so it is assumed you know what the heck is going on.
B0026PA05M|5.0|Heard one of their songs on the radio and liked it so bought the album...i enjoyed the whole thing.  I'll have to see what else they have available and hopefully they are just as good.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child has the ability to real you in and keep you captivated the whole time.  I can't wait to start his next book.
034580404X|5.0|I loved the books! Though they had a lot of sex scenes that was tiresome sometimes, the story was wonderful. I really liked how their love developed in the books and how much both sides tried hard for the relationship. For me, it really worths reading it!!!
B00005LELD|4.0|i normally dont leave a rating or review for a product. all i can say is the seller is highly recomended this particular item is great  ive been using it good quality.
B009PAETCG|5.0|its so fun you can get goals past ton of defenders trust me if you like soccer you will love this game
B000FZETKC|5.0|Loved this as a child and was excited to buy it for my niece to share the experience of a lifetime.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A wonderful marvelous guide to a positive life outlook.  Laughter with mind/body health is key.  That is why I'm also reading [...] Howie Weener Unclogged.  Great companion to the Four Agreements.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Got my boyfriend hooked on the series and had to buy it to catch him up. We can’t get enough of Walking Dead...
B00499QUK2|5.0|Its series drama in the higher caliber of HBO-style productions. Love the dry Brit humor, and the excellent cast/acting. I'm hooked!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have much more to offer than just &#34;Thrift Shop&#34;, as all of these songs are great hip hop without some of the more tired elements of the genre.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am not a fan of british shows but I loved this TV series and can't wait for series 4.
B0009HLD0K|3.0|This is the most overrated Dennis Quaid film of all times.  I thought the movie was very slow paced.  I also had heard from critics that this was a funny movie.  It was a very depressing movie about four 19 year olds who decide  to drop out of society by not attending college or finding jobs.  They call themselves the &#34;Cutters&#34; for two reasons they are the children of stone cutters and they decided to &#34;cut&#34; college.  The one boy begins to work in his father's used car business but his father has a heart attack.  The father then realizes that there is a place in this world for dreams.  He allows his son to persue his love of bicycling.  The four boys decide to enter a bicycle contest as a 4 man team although only the one boy is interested in bicycling.  I do have to say at least the four learn the importance of teamwork and end up winning the race.
B00689ILQC|4.0|She is not one of my favorite singer, but this CD its really good and enjoy it!!!!!!!! I recommended it!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was fun to read; I am looking forward to the next book to read from his perspective.<br /><br />As a mother of a 19 year old college student I am SO glad my daughter goes to school locally, he's a bad boy, fun to read about but wow a momma' s fear.  Lol<br /><br />Thanks for the wonderful escape!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I owned this movie for years, lost my vast movie collection of several thousand movies in my house fire before Christmas. I found this movie while starting my collection back up, I did not have the directors cut before, glad I found this one, explains the movie better, a must have if you ever saw the short version
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really do like this app! It's a great app it's like temple run. Every month the location changes. It's a fun kids app (it can also be a adults app), I really suggest  it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|One of the best shows in a long time :)<br />provides comfort and fit, with long battery life...meets all expectations
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games i ever played i love this game its so awesome i cant stop playing !!
B002N44XSG|4.0|&#34;These files/stories correspond with the Percy Jackson series. If you haven't already read the series (or at least the first book) I would not suggest reading this book yet, because you will be confused about the plot and characters.  I would suggest reading part of the series and then this book to read additional stories that were not in the series. That being said, since I had already read all of the series, I enjoyed this book a lot.&#34;- This was a quote from my 11-year-old daughter who is a huge Rick Riordin fan.
B007REV4YI|4.0|For those critics who had trouble following the plot, I suspect that you are used to being spoon-fed plots or you've already read the book.  And frankly, this plot was more interesting than the usual Bond versus bad guys with the predictable special effects and no substance.  I liked it.  The rest of you naysayers are just jealous of Daniel Craig.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best I ever read am so happy she can rise from all that it gives people strength so see her over come that. Her and peers are amazing together. If there was another it woulda been done in two days like all the others
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Captain America, Thor, and the others working together. What's not to like.  Funny parts make the movie.  It is worth buying to watch again.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|its like minecraft so its good but then there is spawn eggs! so that makes it even better way better play the full version tho.
0920668364|5.0|My children are 27, 24 and 21.  Over the course of these years as a parent I would say I have read, sung and enjoyed this books hunderds of times.  If it doesn't bring tears to your eyes you are not reading it right.  This copy was purchased a gift for our neighbor's first birthday.  Her parents requested that gifts be your favorite children's book,  I did not even have to think twice for which book I would give.  A must for all households.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great mix of plot and amazing stunts.  Great execution of the Bond series formula.  Villain not the most plausible, but have they ever been?  I enjoyed it.
B00000I07R|2.0|I haven't yet received the product, thus, there is no way it can be reviewed. If you need something, please send me a message.
B0015AARJI|5.0|You cannot substitute generics for originals.  There is a big difference in using this original one compared to the generics.  I cannot describe it in words, but I highly recommend buying original controllers.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, but needs a update.I thought of one where you can exchange coins for gold.But still, this game is awesome
1582701709|4.0|The power lies within you. I knew it all along. The book helps you realize it. Glad I bought it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love it. This has been a great season! The governor's eye looks so gross!!!! Go team Dixon!!! I hope Merle isn't the douche he acts to be!
B003G94BZC|5.0|Obviously, Dr. Who in general is a very good show, and the writing in this season is definitely a cut above the previous seasons.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This series is a mix of X-files meets CSI.  The story line gets more complex as the series goes and as anyone knows who was a fan of Lost, J.J. Abrams deals in this form of writing.  I'm already watching Season 2 after finishing Season 1 in less than 2 weeks.<br /><br />I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys X-Files and Through The Wormhole.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|I felt this was a convenient way to get a movie.<br />I do think the price was too high.<br />I don't think I'll rent from Amazon until their price comes down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series. So glad someone has written a show about this time period.  Can't wait to watch next season!
1609611543|5.0|Since I have given up wheat I have less bloating and less cravings. Dr Davies is right about wheat being addictive, I have personally experienced that. I cut out wheat and other high carb foods and I do not miss them. I have been making my own bread using almond and lindseed meal with eggs and protein powder.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I found the direction to be unusal, at times a bit gimicky but overall incredibly creative. All characters gave steller perforfmances
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen has been a favorite author since I was in my teens and while Persuasion is my absolute favorite of her books, Pride and Prejudice comes a very close second. At first I loved the romantic story but as I have matured and re-read the story many times, more and more subtlety comes to light. Jane Austen's wicked humor, social insight and dead-on characterization makes all her books really enjoyable. Pride and Prejudice is  a window into what life was like for young women 200 years ago.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|LOVE the show ! just had to pre - order it when it was coming to dvd and blu-ray! too great of a show not to own!
B00002N9ER|5.0|My husband loves these.  He attaches them to the floor board of his truck next to his seat where he can get to his flashlight easily.  They work great and hold the flashlight in place very well.

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I LOVE Game of Thrones. Had previously purchased season 1 on blu-ray through amazon and loved it so when I saw season 2 with a great deal for preordering it, I just HAD to get it. Great product, great packaging, and super fast shipping! VERY happy with my purchase. =)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It has a lot of twists and turns  I couldn't put it down it is a good book read it
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Decent movie but I am glad I didn't drop big $$$$ seeing it in the theaters.  Movie has a kind of 'gay' antagonist.  Weird for a JB film!  Plus, the theme is about whether 007 is too old for the game anymore.  Maybe it should have been about whether Craig is too old to be 007 anymore?  Not a bad movie but not as thrilling as the last one.
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda lives in our hearts and this is a beautiful tribute. This book is a must have.
0596809158|5.0|I love this book because you do not need to read it linearly. You got a problem coding and life a laser, it point to a solution. I love the discussion that follows as it help generalize the issue that brought you to that topic. Brilliant.
0201633612|5.0|I found this book an invaluable knowledge base for commonly occurring patterns we as software architects come across. Would have liked to see a sequel to this edition.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is TRULY one of the best shows on television! It's well acted, nice scenery (NYC is always amazing...) and the storyline is interesting. Highly recommended!
B00AFEY354|5.0|We actually rented this movie knwoing little of nothing about it.  The movie we wanted to watch was out so this was a \\"fill in\\".  This movie was simply awesome.  One day later the store has sold three more DVD's as every person at our movie night had to own a copy.  I generally am not a fan of movies in this genre, but this was such a caring and real film that I could not stop watching it.  I am not even going to go into a synopsis of the film for you, except to say it's one of those incredible movies you just \\"discover\\".<br /><br />We loved it :)
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|the last one, why did it have to come with the last one.<br />could have done withou the last one
B004SIIBGU|4.0|great app...easy access.  A little hard to navigate when looking up items but that may be just me being spoiled to looking at ebay online.

B003SNKBXW|1.0|( The reason for the stars on this review is that the Kindle edition is almost unreadable. There are copious amounts of grammatical errors and misspellings on every single page. It's so bad that it requires re-reading just to figure out where a sentence should stop and another should begin. It was a HUGE distraction while reading the story. The book in and of itself is fantastic and worthy of a purchase, just don't get the e-book. )<br /><br />A decade ago I saw a movie starring Johnny Depp called The Ninth Gate. There was nothing special about it. It wasn't a Hollywood blockbuster and didn't garner much critical praise. It did, however, capture my attention and stick with me in a way that very few stories have. Over ten years later I finally sat down to read the book this film was based on. In one day I stormed through the story, devouring it page by page. As the old saying implies, this book is definitely better than the movie. The character development is fantastic. Literary nerds will be engrossed by the way in which classic tales interweave into the present day action and mystery of the novel. Those without a background reading, or appreciation of, some of the modern day classic literature might not enjoy this quite as much, but the tale has enough twists and excitement that it's worth giving a shot. If I were rating the book on story alone it would be an easy 5 of 5 stars. It is indeed one of my favorites, but the writing isn't perfect. Overall, the pacing could have been a bit better and perhaps a little more explanation in the end could have improved it. These minor squabbles, though.<br /><br />* I will add that as a Christian this story did give me some initial second thoughts. It is steeped in a mystery of the occult and includes personification of demonic forces. Read with caution and remember this is fiction.
B0072440OE|5.0|very satisfied with the shipment... enjoying the record so much... the packaging is very good and i received the shipment earlier than i expected..
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|Love anything Johnny Depp does.  Bucket list includes watching all of his movies.  He is so versatile and can play many rolls.  He does like to play roles where he can get into costume.

B00BHMF578|4.0|This movie was slow to begin with but picked up and intensity after 'the group' went out into the streets for a trial run of being movie makers.  Did it deserve to be best picture? Can't say as I haven't seen the rest of the movies.
B0018OASZE|5.0|very satisfied with the shipment... enjoying the record so much... the packaging is very good and i received the shipment earlier than i expected..
B007G92QGO|5.0|The book raises many issues around the role vs duty of the parent and how far that should go and whether we ever can know or be rational about close family.
B00499S9YC|2.0|i really love the record... but the condition of LP that i received got damaged... on the 3rd song the LP got jammed.. and it stop at one point....
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really excellent story, a real page turner! I couldn't put it down. I will definitely be reading another Colleen Hoover book.

0374214913|5.0|This was already one of the best books I had read in awhile. And then I got to the last page. Rarely have three paragraphs of literature affected me quite so much, even days after finishing the book.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|very satisfied with the shipment... enjoying the record so much... the packaging is very good and i received the shipment earlier than i expected..
B007W8S2MG|5.0|My favorite aspect of this is now I can bring Persona 4 with me where ever I go. I never played the others in the series, but this one always stands out to me for it's wonderfully written story combing love, comedy, thriller, investigative, and horror.
B000007WOP|5.0|very satisfied with the shipment... enjoying the record so much... the packaging is very good and i received the shipment earlier than i expected..
B007M45PMU|5.0|I decided to buy this only because Amazon recommended it, and I was extremely happy with this purchase. I only hope The Lumineers continue to make such masterful works like this in the near future.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic characters and setting.  Downton Abbey is a classic worthy of its many awards.  Focus on life of nobility, servants in the early 1900's and interactions between classes through historical changes and events draws the viewer into this classic in the making.
B000H7JD90|5.0|very satisfied with the shipment... enjoying the record so much... the packaging is very good and i received the shipment earlier than i expected..
B006LSZECO|5.0|There are twists and turns. And in the end you will find yourself twisted , like a vine. Rooting first for one. Then the other. And then for them both. Loving one. Hating the other. Waxing and waning like the moon. I love it when love and hate; awe and loathing; and all the other emotions that share a decidedly fine line between blur into a Monet of impressions that you ultimately feel simultaneously. By the time you figure out the twist, you are too intertwined with the characters to put the book down. Enjoy!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's fun.  Keeps my my grandson very busy.  Challenging to play.  Some levels easy.  Some levels are harder.  I like it.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I was so surprised with this movie. It was GREAT! It holds your interest thru the entire movie. The actors immediately capture your attention and emotions.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I was in a head on car accident in which I had suffered a traumatic brain injury. One of the exercises the concusion clinic had me frequently doing to improve my brain function was solitaire. With this game, I was able to start with a simpler game with one suit and go from there. I am currently on two suits and plan on getting better. This is one of the few games that keep my interest far past my therapy times. It is challenging and addictive! Thank you!
B00027JYLC|5.0|The original film's audio quality is poor, so don't expect much more from the DVD version.  This story is a great lesson in the vein of &#34;never judge a book by it's cover&#34;.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I wanted something to protect the screen, and make it easier to hold while reading. It does the job! I would recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for fancy.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|Not quite as good as the first one, but excellent in it's own right. I LOVE David Warner's Professor Perry character. One of the best character actors around. The action is pretty good, the music. I thought the Tokka and Rahzar costumes were very good. It's funny. Just not quite as dark as the first one, which is missed a little. But, two thumbs up, nonetheless.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting story line. Kept me reading although the ending was &#34;expected&#34; it was a good ending. i would suggest it for a &#34;change&#34; in Love story. It's about love of family.
B0000248VB|5.0|Get the REAL DEAL and listen to one of the Greatest composers of my lifetime. Mancini puts many of his greatest, earlier, works on this collection. Sit back and just let the music take you on a wonderful, nostalgic voyage.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|But then all books are, right? So if going to see the movie, read the book later or the movie will be disappointing. The book is much better than the movie, more intense and exciting read.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but this movie was horrible.  It dragged to the point it felt like they were just adding unnecessary details so they could figure out how to make 3 movies out of it.  Not a movie to see in the theaters...wished had waited for the DVD.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|isn't that what faith is all about. However, good to see a Doctor want to use science to prove heaven exists.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. This is probably the best show we have seen in years. Great Story, Well Written, excellent acting.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Just as easy to use as website, but it's mobile!  The only critique I have is that sometimes filtering/refining can get a bit tricky.  Easy to use and very responsive though.  I especially like it for listing postings, as I can just take the pictures on my phone and put it straight to the listing withough having to save it separately.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|we love each and every episode...how the plot twists and turns keeps us coming back! we can't wait to see what happens next!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|So fun.  I watched this with my husband and 3 year old.  We all had a great time.  My daughter really liked the music and the potty-humor.  She was dancing throughout the show.  There was entertainment for grown-ups too, so we weren't bored.  This will be a Halloween classic at our house.
B006O6F932|1.0|This is the flimsiest play set I have ever seen. While the other reviewers are correct that it is a cinch to put together and to store the trade off is that it is very wobbly and made out of the thinnest plastic I have ever seen in a toy like this. My 7-year old cannot play with it without the walls collapsing or one of the pieces falling off. Also, the desks and picnic tables are too small for the MH dolls. You have to really contort them to get them into the seats and if you touch them once they're in they will tip over. I cannot believe I paid $60 for this piece of junk that is now being held together with duct tape. Buyer beware!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I love the actors/actresses in this movie.  I fell in love with all (well almost all - watch it and you'll see what I mean) the characters as well.  Not one I would watch often as it is a bit heavy at times, but I enjoyed the time with the story.
0765325950|5.0|If you are mad about not being released in a kindle version, well stop publishers have to make money somehow.<br /><br />On to the book...... well what more can I say. It's about the best ending to a book that I have ever read, way better then the Malazan Empire endings, or Mistborn
B007C52NY2|3.0|all three books were to be paperback, one was not. Sent to an inmate, so he cannot have the hardback book to read
0060245867|5.0|Great book.  My daughter has loved this book since she was about 18 months old (she is now 3).  This was a gift for one of her friends.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book is exciting and keeps you from putting it down. I have always like the books written by Terry Goodkind they never fail to please.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|How I wish we had a zillion more of these movies - clean, compassionate and so wonderful.  I absolutely recommend - a must see.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book juxtaposes the beauty and healing power of flowers with the harsh reality of life in the foster system.  It's quite charming, but with an edgy side as well.  By the end, the reader feels the healing which has occurred.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|The price was right (99c)  The movie told me how it was back in the day It was very informative and the story line had some action Ilked it
0345803493|5.0|I liked the first part but I am enjoying this part even more, it's not just about sex, but a real relationship and how the love story evolves , the characters show more of themselves...I like it and can't get enough of it, almost done with this one , expecting the third book...
B001O5LVPI|5.0|It has GREAT music by the King of Rock 'N' Roll/ Elvis Presley and a movie the whole family will love!!
0316227706|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I had an even bigger smile with the turn of each page.  I mean, just take a look at that face on the cover -- it only keeps getting better and better.  I also really appreciated the fact that the author included a &#34;head shot&#34; of each pup at the end of the book so you can see what they look like when they weren't diving for goodies.  Brilliant book, I wish I thought of it!
B00843TZJ2|5.0|These guys still have it. The vocals are excellent.  High quality video.I wish I could have been at this show. Good price for dvd's  & cd's
B0054SMID0|4.0|Enjoyable movie with a good story and plot.  I would not recommend for any children under the age of 18.
B000002L3P|5.0|Since SRV has passed on there are very few rock/blues fusion guitarists worth listening to. KWS is always a pleasure.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I found the book very interesting.  Would like to think the book told fairly accurate details of the deployments.  The story gave an insight to the reality of war.  Something that most people don't understand.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use this alarm clock almost every single day!! It offers customizable settings such as the brightness, the sound, and the option to fall asleep to white noise. This app does only have basic features, but it is great for a free app. I love that it is easy to use and works for its purpose.
0307595579|5.0|Excellent Condition
B00992CF6W|5.0|not a top off you just play it like on Pc and a seed to get a buntch of stuff is 0.4.0 :D
B008CLI4N4|1.0|Thirty years ago this would have been sold as a porn movie. I watched the entire series. Wow, what a mistake it was buying this PORN FLICK. Had I know I never would have bought it. There are 20 to 25 porn scenes in season one. Yes, frontal nude shots of men and woman. Yes, numerous copulation scenes, fornication, prostitution, men with men in an intimate sexual scene, woman with woman and dialogue of adults with children. Good lord, why is this not rated X. Had I known it was a porn flick I would not have bought it. As soon as i understood it was getting pornographic i ignored the scene and fast forwarded through it.
B003E74B24|5.0|It's short but, simple and to the point. Really gives you a good insight on the great chef and why he is the way he is. Truly brilliant.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really enjoy this series and can hardly wait for Season 4.  Of course, they ended with a cliff hanger that's right up there with &#34;Who killed JR?&#34;
B004W4N55C|4.0|I have had several phones/tablets over the last couple of years. This app worked great on gingerbread.  When I got the Sony tablet s running ICS, it had the same issue as everyone else - shutting down when logging in or searching. Then I upgraded my phone to the htc one x with android 4.0.4 and I have never had a problem with this app even though it is also running ICS. Hope it will continue to work when I get my jelly bean update. Anyway, I m not sure if it is only tablets running ICS that have issues but so far so good on my htc one x!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Colorful,easy to learn...need to be able to earn or trade for gold. Fun to see other dragon lands. Good game!!
0345803485|1.0|cannot even get through a third of this book.<br />i jumped on this band wagon and quickly regretted it.<br />no thanks...never again.
0345531930|2.0|While I enjoyed reading most of the book the ending was a huge disappointment.  It felt rushed and carelessly thrown together, like a high school student hurrying to finish an overdue book report.<br /><br />The characters were very superficial.  Not Grisham's best, or even close.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter continues to excel in storylines, acting and all around performance.  The price was very reasonable as well as low shipping costs.  Sound and picture quality great.  If you like Dexter, I would recommend The Following, which is a new series on the Fox network.  It's awesome!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I thought they put together a good recap of the important events in the story. This is a great review before starting the second season.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I must say this book kept me interested from start to finish. Excellent read! Definitely a good entertaining read that pulls you in.
B00457X7IQ|4.0|i enjoyed the book but i will probably not continue reading the other books for now. it was a little to childish
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It looks like a game for kids but more difficult than it looks. It is so awesome there are no words. Must have app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book like all the books in this series is wonderfully written! It takes you to another world and makes you feel such a part of it. The detail is so intense you forget what you're reading isint real history. One of the greatest stories I've ever read.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I had no idea how much I would enjoy watching all six in the correct order and it was amazing.  The first 3, non original, were actually quite good.  I think I liked Revenge of the Sith the most of all six and I am a star wars freak.  Also, my 3.5 and 5.5 year old are addicted now as well.  Only down side, is some of the deaths in the newer versions are a little too often and realistic unlike the original three.  Caught me off guard a bit with the little guys watching.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I love it but I can't get it to work blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I had a tough time putting this book down, very good reading, very good information in it. I highly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|One Of My Friend Introduced Me To This Game Ever Since I Fell In Love With The Game Especially If Your A JP Fan.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A gripping story of one man's battle with alcoholism.  Denzel Washington does a great job in an academy award worthy performance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so good you learn a lot from it but it is hard to earn gems but you just have to keep takeing care of your horse and you will earn a lot of stuff
B004JLDSIC|5.0|This is such a beautiful blend of great saxophone and voice that expresses heart with clarity and beauty.  I will buy many more for gifts as the appeal is universal!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Almost didn't read this one. I thought it would be just another teenage love story, but was I ever wrong. It is a great read that keeps you going until the end. There are several supprises, with twist & turns.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This is great, a live CD and the concert DVD.  Especially important since probably 90% of Taylor's fans ( like myself ) did not have a chance to see her live in concert.  Nice mix of songs from the Speak Now and the previous albums.  Great excuse to buy a HDTV if you don't have one :  )
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Both my grandchildren love to play this game.  They take turns playing and do not like to give it over for the other to have a turn. I don't play the game but am glad I got it for the grandkids!
1560100842|4.0|I bought this book for my drawings and personal animation. But when my children looked at it they took it and started to draw the pictures in it. They loved it. It has many examples of appropriate posing for your animation as well as basic drawing techniques. Great!!
B0043VDIAG|4.0|Loved it, read it in two days i think<br />Now to see the movie<br />The book is always better though !
0240810961|5.0|It is really a short book to show those 20 years of Disney animation. Plenty of concepts and drawing. It is an excellent reference book for animators!
B000R8YC1I|5.0|I have loved the Dark Crystal since I first saw it when I was little.  My mom had this on VHS before I was born and we had to buy another copy because of how many times I watched it.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of behind the scenes material and this has everything that was on the original DVD release as well as new material recorded for this release.  I am also a huge fan of Brian Froud who was the conceptual artist on this film and did a commentary for this feature.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|I have a 7 year old son and we play with his Legos together. I wanted him to help out when ever possible for my upcoming wedding. These Legos were his contribution to the grooms cake decor. It was a hit and my husband and son got to do them together. It was a small thing that meant a lot. Loved it.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|really a very weird and boring film-- confused, oddly disquieting, acting is good I suppose ,but script and intent border on the incomprehensible
0140177396|4.0|I read this book when I was in high school, quite frankly did not pay that much attention.  Read it again and loved it.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|He plays with the puzzle over and over again.  We paid the $1.99 for the product so I do wish it had more puzzles.  However, it does keep my son engaged and it helps him with his hand and eye coordination which I think is great.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|Marilyn Manson would have to be one of the most gross people in the entertainment industry and I found some of his stories to be quite revolting.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|As an avid science fiction reader from the day I learned to read, so much of the new stuff today is just a rehash of old ideas, and most often not as well written as the original.  While there may be other &#34;man stranded on a planet alone&#34; stories out there, this one is totally engaging! It presents the science accurately as near as I can tell, but most importantly, it celebrates the will to live and the power of thinking outside the box. I'm looking forward to reading more from Mr. Weir.
B0047DVHV2|4.0|A book by Keith Richards would have to be fascinating as he has lead the ultimate rock lifestyle of drugs, sex and rock and roll and he tells quite a tale.  One can only wonder how he is still alive to do so.

B007FDE4Y8|1.0|I was never able to balance the Opteka SteadyVid Stabilizer System for Digital Cameras, after fruitless weeks of trying. I watched videos on YouTube and even solicited help from the people at my local camera store. Not only is there a lack of documentation, let alone a video on the company Web site that might show you how to accomplish the trick, there is a lack of calibration indicators/numbers/settings on the piece of equipment itself. Even if, by a miracle, you were to balance the system, from my perusal of the comments of other owners, putting it down messes up the adjustments, and you would be hard-pressed to recalibrate the device as you would not know where to set it to.<br /><br />At the time I sent the device back, I felt defrauded. The supremely inadequate documentation informs you that it would take an estimated &#34;hundreds&#34; of adjustments over many days to get the device to work (to put it into balance). If I had known that, I would not have bought it.<br /><br />After the nightmare of trying to balance/adjust the device to make it work, the real nightmare began when I tried to return the device. I sent an email to Opteka support telling them I wanted to return it for a refund, as was required. Days later, when I contacted them again about how to return it, I was informed me that there was no refund coming as my inquiry was beyond the 30 day threshold for returns. (One starts the process by sending an email to their support staff.)<br /><br />When I protested and forwarded my original email showing I was within the 30 day return window when I made my inquiry about how to return the device, I was told I had been sent an email with instructions and a so-called “RMA NUMBER” required for returns via email. When I said I had not received said email and threatened to contact the consumer protection authorities, I was sent another email with a return (RMA) number. I sent the device back.<br /><br />Four months later, no refund.<br /><br />I soon willbe contacting the New York State Attorney General. Stay away from this product and this company.
1481278738|5.0|This book helped me understand some key ponts in using the Go-Pro that differ from a traditional camera, I need those tips and it was all right there in the book for me. The angle section was a great visual for me too.

B009YQJ322|5.0|I love this movie, Very true to the comicbook. Discent cast and background. I give it two thumbs Way UP:)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of those stories that is difficult to put aside for very long.  It reminded me a bit of watching an episode of one of those &#34;survival in the wild with little to nothing&#34; type reality shows but with much higher stakes.  Very enjoyable read.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I thought this movie was going to suck when my girlfriend suggested to watch this. Boy was I wrong. Laughs all through out! Must watch.
0800141709|5.0|This classic film about the cold war is both a comedy and a dark satire from director Stanley Kubrick.  It has 3 character roles acted by Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove, as The President, and as Captain Mandrake; Other major roles are acted by Sterling Hayden as U.S. Air Force Commender and George C. Scott as Joint Chief of Staff &#34;Buck&#34; Turgidson.  The movie is about a plan of a nuclear attack on Russia's strategic targets and the possible following apocalypse of a nuclear winter.  However, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair-bound nuclear scientist has bizzare ideas about man kind's future.<br />This movie is both funny and frightening.
B00BHMF578|5.0|It is not often that watching a movie at home will make me tense and the palm of my hands sweat but this one did.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|The story of an unassuming Kung Fu Master who battles a great evil and finds the love of his life.
B009CPGHDI|3.0|My daughter begged to rent this movie for weeks.  Well the time finally came and she hit the rent button with more anticipation than a poor kid turned rich on Christmas Morning.<br /><br />All said and done, they were VERY disappointed.  Personally I had much better things to do than waste my time watching this.  I mean..  I had AMAZON reviews to write. ;)
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|This spoof of the Star Wars movie is unparalleled comedy, is entertaining, and is very, very funny!<br />I started laughing within the first 4 minutes after the movie had begun.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|Entertaining..  Kinda..<br /><br />I give it 1 bathroom trip up. ;)  Then you wont ever touch it again.  But it's worth it for a little bit.  Maybe a car ride.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent writing! The author's character development and view point of story telling from each character's perspective was amazingly realistic.  The unexpected twist at the end of the story surprised me so much that I wanted to go back and read the story again! V<br />ery good book!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A nice transition from the original to the sequel.  I like the additions, I like the gameplay.  The twisty, turney paths are pretty cool and the graphics have WAY been stepped up a notch.
6304806418|4.0|Being a history buff I like stories about real people.  Eva Peron was an interesting lady that helped herselt and her husband while taking advantage of the poor , but making it look like they were being helped.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It is a real eye opener. to understand what is going on in Iraq.  I am glad I read it.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Keeps to the theme and has plenty of use of technology and action. Has not failed to deliver. I would watch it again.
B007MDB548|5.0|The only thing my daughter loves more than Disney's Rapunzel is Disney's Fairies. Watching this movie with my daughter has and will continue to create some magical memories for us. Right now, it is her all time Fav movie.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Easy read and suspenseful! Really got wrapped up in it and was a great way to pass a winter's evening.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It has been some time since I read a book by John Grisham.  I remembered his earlier books to be real page-turners, with excitement and plot twists.  I did not find this book to provide any of that.  The story unfolded in a fairly predictable manner and never put me on the edge of my seat.  The ending left me looking for more, for that one final twist.  I wasn't sure how to feel about the protagonist.  There wasn't enough empathy established in the beginning to really allow me to root for him in the end.  All of the characters seemed shallow.  It was just good enough to get me to finish it, but I was never tempted to pick it up at times other than my normal reading time.  Not really worth the money.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I think most Hitchcock fans will like this movie. It is especially interesting and informative to see Alma Hitchcock's contribution to her husband's success.<br />Hopkins and Mirren give very good performances, although Hopkins imitation of Hitchcock's style of speech is inconsistent. However, I have to say the the actor that played Anthony Perkins was spot on. I absolutely did a double take when he first came on screen and I heard him talk!<br />The take away is that Hitchcock wouldn't be Hitchcock without Alma, despite the fact that she was never really given the proper credit.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I heard this was a great book. I was pleasantly surprised when I got hooked in. I did not see it coming...you won't either! I won't give anything away. Suffice it to say I recommend this book to people who like their books just a bit twisted and not what they were expecting.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I like this book 'cause it has humor and Greg likes Holly and she is WAY to old for him!  :)
B00BHMF578|2.0|More like a documentary than a real movie.  No real action, just history of some not well known events during the hostage taken in Iran
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I loved this movie.  The Tintin character is likeably and fun to watch.  I hope they plan on producing more Tintin films.  The ending hints at more to come.  It reminded me of the young Indiana Jones series...adventerous and entertaining.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read it in two days. It was so hard to put it down. I saw the movie after and was disappointed. The book was so much better then the movie.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|i bought these to try them out in hopes i'll get a cheap mic that I can use, and it was a complete waste! Hissing, battery drains quick, too much ambient noise. Save your money and spend a little bit more on quality mics, it makes all the difference!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is very useful on my Kindle Fire.  I'm really enjoying being able to look things up on it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|As always, these episodes rock! Anyone who is a motorcycle enthusiast, will enjoy watching these. I highly recommend all seasons of the show. Not something for young kids to be watching though.
B000V86OKG|2.0|My order was for the Third Season of Dexter.  I did not complain or ask to return it as I felt it would be too costly.  I would still recommend ordering from Amazon.
0143120581|2.0|What the?  I read this book cover to cover and I am still trying to figure out WHY Amy Chua wrote it, other than perhaps to excuse her behavior, make money, or toot her own horn---or all of the above in all likelihood. While she points out that she clearly does NOT care what other people think of her.....I can't help but think that everything she does TO or FOR her children was to  promote herself and status in society.  Other people's opinions seems to be the driving force in her life and she is too self-involved to take notice.  She gloats to the reader about her accomplishments and those of her immediate and extended family like a self-righteous narcissist, while attempting to appear slightly humble, though I am convinced there isn't a humble or benevolent bone in her body--and she simultaneously complains that Chinese parenting is more difficult than Western parenting.  Aww, that is so sad and I feel so terrible for all she sacrifices for her children.  If your goal in life is to have \\"exceptional\\" children that make YOU finally feel complete, then do what you need to do (good luck with that).  I parent a child with special needs who will NEVER be a math prodigy or a music prodigy, and simply because I do not force her to suffer the rigors of hours of daily practice does not mean that parenting her is any less difficult.  Nor do I believe that she needs to be the \\"best\\" at something in order to matter in this world--to me, to herself, or to anyone else.<br /><br />I think Amy missed the point of life on this earth entirely--it is not about individual greatness as she would lead herself and her family to believe.  And I kept hoping that she would come to some ground breaking conclusion at the end that could redeem her.  Sadly, that did not come to fruition.<br /><br />I gave Amy two stars, one for simply writing a book (and if  could divide that one star up into tiny pieces then those could go towards all her \\"accomplishments\\" in life, as recognition seems to beher ultimate life goal), and the second star for making parents stop and think about their parenting style, even for a moment, because YES we Westerners do tend to coddle a bit more perhaps than we should.  And my rating is in typical Western fashion.  I am giving Amy stars just for doing something....albeit even if those stars are earned by disgusting many people and promoting herself and her children shamelessly.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie....all actors so real-to-life in the emotions one would feel.....also was glad to see the subject exposed, did not know this much before. Bravo, Ben!!!  I also love movies like this which tell of the persistence of the human spirit in face of such terrible odds. Thank you.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I up graded from DVD to Bluray. I like this movie and it's one of his best. If you haven't seen it yet buy you will like it
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes did a fantastic job, also other actors/actresses in the movie. Shows how wrong &#34;predictions&#34; can be, and how strong the human spirit. Wish I had known this terrific lady named Temple, and her Mom! Thanks
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A very touching story. Highly recommend. People of all ages can appreciate the beauty in the story of Auggie and his friends and family.
B006H5120E|5.0|I loved the movie the first time but fell in love with the movie again in 3D. Brilliant worth the money, paid 1/2 off retail.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|worth watching - getting ready for season 3.  better to watch it for free and record on DVR but i was deployed.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Wow, this was an excellent movie. The special effects and 3d was awesome. I loved it. Highly recommended to anyone with 3d.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story that highlighted the higher purpose we all should be serving. Brought many tears to mine and probably many others eyes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such a good book that really makes you feel for every character in it. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I choose to rate the book a five star because I found it very well written . It was extremely detailed and it elaborated on difficult words that children wouldn't normally use in an everyday conversation.
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I love BBC drama so I am a bit of a sucker for this title. I saw it when it first came out and loved it.
B00969GFFU|1.0|I've always heard such good things about Jonathon Franzen that I was happy when our book club selected \\"Freedom\\" as our monthly read. I turned to page 1 with great anticipation.  I made it to page 142 and felt like I was slogging through mud.  I finally called it quits.  Franzen details the thoughts of his characters, Patty in particular, with such great detail that it's almost nauseous.  I knew I could never ake it to the end of the book because I simply didn't care.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great program, well worth the time and cost.  Can't wait for season 4. Five out of five stars doesn't really rate the program
B004OC07F8|3.0|I realize that the book was written several years ago, but as someone who deal with Lockheed Martin and has seen how the JSF debacle has unfolded I can't give more than 3 stars to a book that uses it as an example of how to do business.<br />All in all the book is confusing and hard to follow. Some examples are ok, but the actual &#34;how&#34; of implementing a Blue Ocean strategy was lost on me, and I've read more than a few business books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the mine cart addition! The levels are challenging and the gameplay is smooth. Download this game now. Highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Even though this will be at least the 4th time I've started from the beginning, I still love this game the most!
B0086QS7N2|4.0|I´ve been a big fan of Rush for a long time, but I started losing interest after Test for Echo. I was very disappointed with Snakes and Arrows and thought that finally Rush had outgrown me (or me outgrown them). But here comes Clockwork Angels. Tough, hard sound. Not too much complexity, just the raw guitar and big drums that I´ve enjoyed since the beginning (brought me back to 2112, although the music is significantly different in tempo).<br />I did miss the abrupt changes in pace and especially the keyboards, but it is a good Rush album. Recommended.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Effects were great.  Story weak.  Sad that this one was even weaker than then original, which was not that great.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I'm not much of a &#34;gamer&#34; but this app has surely captured my attention. I don't play it often but when I do I certainly find myself enjoying it.

B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I downloaded this for free but it has only seen use by my young nephew who is 3. It's okay in my book.
B00AEBB8YW|3.0|harrison ford is awesome, the rest of the cast is silly. [[ASIN:B00377E5SG Sabrina (1995)]] the girl acts as she wants to get nasty-i suspect she went to the school of nasty in paris -the city of nasty- - the romance between her and the brothers is flurty fun but not really love. the funniest scean is when her servent father says he's been insider trading all these years and is almost as rich as the larabee's. i'm not an old school geazer i think the humphery bogot versen has room for improvement; but it's still better than this bad remake.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This has had me hooked ever since I downloaded it. Probably because of friend of mine keeps tweeting his time improvements and I just want to beat him. Either way it's definitely a fun and addicting game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is beautiful. It catches you right from the start; pulls you in. Get ready for an adventure and become spell-bound in this heart warming novel of true love and the endless possibilities that come with it.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Great app that let's you challenge yourself with timed games and various difficulty levels. I've always enjoyed playing this game and this just makes it funner since it's only a click away.
0802473164|5.0|Its a great book for single or married people to get some info from. I really like it and recommended it to anyone
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a fascinating plot and keeps you going...never sure what the outcome will be.  A story affecting abused women and so true.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I am having a good time with this app even though it is a little lacking on the animation.  The hiding places are well thought out and not all very easy.
B004KBSQOW|3.0|I first heard Over the Rainbow at the end of the movie 50 first dates. Thought it was a nice rendition. The other songs that are on this CD are good too.
B007SGM084|4.0|little heavy on the sex but I enjoyed the excitement and the drama as the stories grew. Fantastic ending...I really enjoyed it.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Looking for a simple notepad for my Android devices (Galaxy S2, and Kindle Fire) that I could capture quick notes and email to myself.  Tried others that would email with an extension not easily read on a PC.  This application attaches as an HTM document.  Useful app for what I needed.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this album.  It has a great variety in types of music and eras that the music was taken from.  Emmy has a very good voice, but after listening to her first album was wondering what this one would be like.  It was great.
B00A77II0U|4.0|this game is fun and has interesting hidden objects. if you want something different and are tired of the same hidden object game you will enjoy this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book but quite forgettable.  I found it a bit predictable - but I do read a lot of books.  Overall a good quick read but nothing special.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|when I first saw the game I thought it would be on of those lame action games that is way overrated but after regrowing it was a really fun uncreated game. U can free rome an entire city fight thugs and huge lizards. Trust me its a great game.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I love this app I have it on my cell and my kindle recently purchased it on the Kindle so I can read it better. It is an amazing app.
B000I62JAK|1.0|This movie was recommended to me....Why? Owen Wilson's performance is probably the best thing about this movie, however, that fact is not enough to justify anyone's sitting through an hour and a half of this poor screenplay.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Same old Nathan with a co-start just as good.  Great supporting cast as well. Love the role reversal of his mother and daughter. The two detectives that work for Beckett, the captain and the forensics gal make a great balance on the police side with Castle in the middle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had to see if this trilogy was worth all the hype considering there were lots of library bans.  I felt it was more about compromise in a relationship rather than BDSM. Much more vanilla than I though it would be.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such an intense book emotionally.  I cried all the way through it.  It was cathartic and fulfilling in every way.  An amazing read from finish to end.  I didn't want it to end.  I will read more by this author.
B00846REIS|4.0|I dislike short cliff hanger books where you have to buy the whole series, but good marketing ploy. Next time I will find a longer book that I only have to pay for once.
B000NY12LO|5.0|The topic seems to be timely too often.  The subject and the emotions of the characters invloved were handled with sincere honesty and I found them to be very believable.  Besides the main plot of the school shooting, the subplots enriched the novel..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to see if this trilogy was worth all the hype considering there were lots of library bans.  I felt it was more about compromise in a relationship rather than BDSM. Much more vanilla than I though it would be.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book. you would think that some of the technical descriptions would be cumbersome but throughout I found that my sympathy for the main character kept me riveted. When I recommended it to a friend he just laughed he had already read it and also enjoyed it thoroughly. I strongly recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is on my list of people to meet before i die.  His work never ceases to amaze me- love it!!
B000HF6XV8|4.0|A charming story well told.  The children were very good and Maggie Smith added her particular excellence as only she can do. Compared to the book, it seemed somewhat rushed; the development of the children's characters was not given enough time methinks. Otherwise enjoyed it very much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had to see if this trilogy was worth all the hype considering there were lots of library bans.  I felt it was more about compromise in a relationship rather than BDSM. Much more vanilla than I though it would be.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well written, touching, and honest story about two people struggling with mental illness. For those of you who have yet to see the film, I recommend reading the book first though the movie does a good job of being true to the story, but also taking &#34;liberties&#34; to keep consistent with the book in general.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am really enjoying this game. Great graphics and such. Just wish that it were easier to get diamonds! Same complaint as a lot of other reviewers.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|app is ok. better then facebook mobile. can share to friends pages with ff. however its slow and takes forever to load. i often get irritated and switch back to mobile because although i cant share with that one, it is faster and i dont have to wait for the page to upload more stories
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This has to be one of the top 10 best books I have ever read!!! The characters are brilliant the story is fast paced and action packed. I couldn't put it down!!! If you are looking for a GREAT GREAT book look no further than this series!!!
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|I enjoyed the character development.  I also liked how they tied timelines and such in with a contemporary threat in the various TV series.

1250006341|5.0|An excellent blend of content  and photos of the Downton Abbey and the backstory behind the television series. Interesting and informative writing provide an enriching story line of the television series. And easily flow from the series to the real life events, customs,  traditions and people that inspired the series. The vivid photos compliment the writing quite well. A wonderful companion guide for for current and future fans  of Downtown Abbey.
1616550414|4.0|I figured it would be more of a timeline and less of a collection of work, but it is still a must have for die hard Zelda fans.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I loved this movie.  It's hard not to love anything that has a cast like this: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, to name a few.  There are three of my favorites anyway.  Penelope Wilton, who's also on the wonderful Downton Abbey with Maggie Smith, does a fantastic job playing the disgruntled wife forced into a retirement environment she clearly thinks is beneath her.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love having and sharing ideas with friends and new Pinterest friends!! I log in everyday and I have never had such and organized , clean beautiful house!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Excellent story, great history, wonderful production, kept us on the edge of our seats throughout the whole movie. Seemed like the movie ended nearly as quickly as we started it. That good!
B007I1QUYE|5.0|This is an oustanding product, i love the quality of the picture and sound. if you are a spiderman fan, blu-ray is the way to go! I highly recommend this product!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I am finding it difficult to follow. Maybe my fault. It's a little complicated but I will keep at it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm actually in a situation somewhat similar to the one presented in this story and opted to read the book as opposed to see the movie.  The book is absolutely phenomenal - it really has you living each character and the end is just perfect (unexpected and gripping).
B0052GACNM|5.0|I love Tony Bennett & with all the other artists, this is a CD worth listening to again and again.

0374533571|4.0|`Silver Lining Playbook' by Matthew Quick was an intricate book that tugs at the heartstrings of its readers. The author takes us through the turmoil and mess that is Pat Peoples' life, the main character. With the help of Tiffany, an eccentric widow, Pat finds it easier to accept his demise that he won't be reconciling with his unfaithful ex-wife. Mr. Quick truly captivates what the battles of depression and bipolar disorder are in a witty and honest way surpassed by his peers today.  As I review the laughs, anger, and heart-warming elements of the book it becomes blatant that Pat is an altruistic person in search for his happy ending and determined to find the silver lining in his own misfortune.<br /><br /> \\"You have to do everything you can and if you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining!\\" -Pat Peoples In my opinion this quote is the most important line in the book. It is the epitome of a positive person, which is exactly what this book is about. The book opens up with Pat Peoples, a thirty-five year old man who is currently locked up in a mental hospital in Baltimore. Dolores, Pat's mother decides to sign him out of the hospital and bring him back to his hometown of Philadelphia. Pat is a die-hard Eagles fan and his life revolves around his physical fitness, reading, and of course is beloved eagles. His goal is to end \\"apart time\\" from his ex-wife Nicki. Although as the story develops we begin to learn how Pat ended up in the hospital and some legal issues he faced time ago. As it turns out Pat was put away for eight years for beating a man whom was caught cheating with his wife. Soon after Pat lost his memory and has no recollection of any of these events. The book may portray this as a factor that adds to Pats demise but I disagree. I believe that these events all completed the character of Pat Peoples. Had he not lost his memory Pat might have been a pessimist main character for the novel. He certainty had a lot working against him but what I loved is that he was so positive. It was not all sunflowers and sunshine. Mr. Quick introduced to us to the leading lady of the novel, Tiffany. \\"She looks sad. She looks angry. She looks different from everyone else I know--she cannot put on that happy face others wear when they know they are being watched. She doesn't put on a face for me, which makes me trust her somehow.\\" -Pat This quote summarizes her well. She is presented as a friend to Pat but she doesn't play an active role at first. Tiffany has had some problems of her own. Although Pat isn't a widow like Tiffany, they share a silent bond over the loss of a spouse. Reading the book, I didn't expect Pat to be such an emotional person considering he is described as very masculine and built but the heart of this character is very compassionate. I admired his desperate need to improve himself. In a way I found that very relatable. It is human nature to contantly strive for improvement. The constant battle with himself was something I knew very well. This book made me take a step back and critically examine life. It sparked my curiosity. Is life fair? Pat seemed like a fantastic guy, yet he had so many unfortunate events in his life. Suddenly, this quote answered my questions. \\"Life is hard, and children have to be told how hard life can be...so they will be sympathetic to others. So they will understand that some people have it harder than they do and that a trip through this world can be a wildly different experience, depending on what chemicals are raging through one's mind.\\"-Dr. Patel, Therapist to Pat. It made the theme of this book so clear. It battled back and forth continually between positive and realistic. It was a balance Pat didn't yet conquer. I certainty feel like this book changed me for the better. The novel gave me a different prospective on the way I handle situations in my life. It gave me the positive attitude to endure hard obstacles because I know that someone has it harder and that's just thelife is sometimes. The great thing about that is that life goes on and after the rain there is always a rainbow. I think that's exactly what Matthew Quick intended to inform his readers. I appreciate that because I love the book and it taught me something I needed to learn at a perfect time in my life. I would defiantly recommend this book to everyone.
B002VLNB1Q|3.0|My first Mayer album was Born and Raised, which is fantastic, so this one doesn't really measure up to it.  Seems a lot of the same as compared to the variety of B&R.
B007P06DOK|5.0|The mixture of genius Paul Simon and African musical themes and styles is one to be admired. The music is lively and inspiring. I dont buy many CDs but I knew that this one was one of the milestones in the annals of musical history and wanted it in my library. Very pleased with it.
B001A3AA0G|3.0|Great for hiking or camping.  Listened to their 2nd album first and I don't think it has quite the diversity of that one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does every function I need and free to boot,so if you want a simple caculator this is a great deal for free!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love this album, which sounds like a tribute to a myriad of musical styles (which I really enjoy).  And there is more uptempo stuff on this one vs. Doowops.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this version of spider. Easy to play and so much fun!!!! Try it I know you will like it.
B002BGA7WM|4.0|It's neat to hear how Muse began.  Initially, they sounded similar to Radiohead (at their beginning too).  But there are enough differences...
B001O0B702|1.0|I bought (2) blu-rays from this vendor..\\"Skyfall and Sex in the city\\"  Skyfall wouldnt play at all and was returned..Sex in the city is also defective with lines flashing across the screen every 1.5-3 seconds, this occurred from start to finish..TWO defective blu-rays from the same vendor??? on the same purchase???  AVOID
B00005JLIU|5.0|Great movie, music, dancing, love everything about it, the perfect movie for people who love the Roaring 20's. Beatrice Lillie is just wonderful!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Although not a self-help book, it provides great insight as to what is the process driving the formation of habits, and how changes could be achieved.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was an entertaining book. It was very difficult to get past the similarities to another popular book. All in all enjoyable.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|The details become so overwhelming that you lose track of the plot.  Fewer small details would help one stay focused.  I have been reading for days and have only completed 37% and I am well into more than 300 pages.  I am debating about finishing it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Just like the first book, this one starts off really slow. I do like that once it picks up you are off on a great journey. I can't wait to finish the series.

B009AMANBA|4.0|OK film fans and movie watchers, stick with me through this review, cause it could be long, but I'll try to keep it from being boring! Shall we begin?<br /><br />Lincoln (2012) was directed by Steven Spielberg, a name synonymous with great film-making. His resume is long, illustrious, and legendary. Jaws. Close Encounters of the Third Kind. E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Raiders of the Lost Ark. Schindler's List. Saving Private Ryan. Catch Me If You Can. Minority Report. The list goes on and on.<br />In 2012, Spielberg finally got around to doing something he had on his mind for almost 15 years - a biopic of Abraham Lincoln. After a long and detailed pre-production, in which both Liam Neeson and Robert Downey Jr. were subsequently cast as Lincoln and dropped, Spielberg cast the electrifying 2-time Academy Award winning British-Irish actor Daniel Day-Lewis. It was the first of a number of good choices that would end up as the brilliant movie Lincoln.<br /><br />1. Daniel Day-Lewis became the first actor in cinema history to win the coveted Best Actor Oscar award 3 times with his stunning performance as the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. And what a towering, electrifying, riveting performance it is. Day-Lewis, as Seth Macfarlane so snidely pointed out at the Oscars, stayed in character for the duration of the shoot - and a relatively hard shoot it was, considering the copious amounts of dialogue and the accent the role required.<br />But man did he succeed! You've heard of method acting, but you haven't seen anything like this. Day-Lewis completely disappears into the character, until (you think to yourself) you could only be watching the real deal - the real Lincoln! It's extraordinary! It's brilliant! It's (insert synonym of amazing)!<br />In my opinion, Lincoln is worth watching for one of the greatest performances in modern history - that of Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln.<br />His is a Lincoln of depth, sensitivity, and fervour, as much a family man as a man of action, one who would just as easily tell a funny anecdote as declare war. It is by far the best portrayal of the man yet.<br /><br />Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, a woman who, in life, suffered from migraines, depression, and bipolar disorder, yet remained faithful and true to her husband until his assassination. Her portrayal can come off as whiny, but that is precisely the point; that was what Mary Todd was like in life. She and Day-Lewis share what is in my opinion, the best scene of the film - an emotional piece where the two scream at each other, angrily pouring out suppressed emotions and regrets over their son's decision to join the army.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones provides a standout, Oscar-nominated performance as Thaddeus Stevens, a grouchy, stolid supporter of the abolishment of slavery. Did I say something about the movie's best scene? I was wrong - the best scene is almost anything with Stevens in it. Take your pick between the \\"It opens\\" scene, or the courtroom rant against Lee Pace's slimy lawyer. Tommy Lee Jones was robbed of his Best Supporting Oscar by Christoph Waltz, ironically in a movie also about slavery.<br /><br />Day-Lewis, Field, and Jones are supported by a talented, all star cast of historical figures, some in little more then cameo roles, which I will go through briefly here: Joseph Gordon-Levitt (beyond criticism as Robert Todd Lincoln), David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Lee Pace (a favorite role of mine, gets some really good scenes), James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, John Hawkes (who form a trio providing much of the comic relief), Jared Harris (as Ulysses S. Grant), David Oyelowo, Lucas Haas, and Dane DeHaan. Filling such a rich historical films with actors of this calibre enhances ones viewing experience, and realizes the world more fully.<br /><br />2. The cinematography of Lincoln is very underrated. When compared to the cinematography of Life of Pi or The Hobbit, Lincoln starts to look a little grey and grim, but surprisingly, that is where it succeeds. Most of the movie is filmed indoors, with little more then a few candles, gas lamps, or windows to illuminate the scenery. As the film progressed, I became more and more impressed at the ways the cinematographer (Janusz Kaminski) illuminated the movie. It's a small victory, and one that few people notice, but it's there to admire on return viewings, along with the John Williams score and the brilliant costumes - so authentic you don't even look at them!<br /><br />3. OK, now I'm not an American. And I don't know much about American history. I know who Lincoln is and what he did, but quite frankly couldn't care less about Thaddeus Stevens or William Seward or Edwin Stanton. The most fascinating part of Lincolns life was his assassination, and the conspiracy leading up to it.<br />Sadly, but respectfully, even reverently, Spielberg shies away from showing the assassination, which comes out of a mix of respect and dignity towards the character.<br />[Note: For a detailed, riveting look at the assassination of Lincoln, I recommend the National Geographic documentary, narrated by Tom Hanks, [[ASIN:B00BHK99JU Killing Lincoln]]]<br />And now we come to my main CON of this otherwise great film - the story. Now keep in mind that I'm not an American, and I really did love the film!<br /><br />The story just couldn't keep me interested. It didn't embroil me in the plot, and for half the time (with my rudimentary knowledge of American history) it seemed like a mix between a documentary and a soap opera. I had no idea what was going on, and strained to hear what fundamental plot points characters were going over in hushed voices.<br />Lincoln jumps right into the heart of American politics without any sort of background or prequel, and to NON-Americans, this can be confusing and non-relevant. It's a movie about Americans, by Americans, for Americans.<br /><br />4. So, in conclusion, Lincoln is a film with stupendous feats of acting that defy comprehension, but the story appeals mostly to the USA (as the international box-office gross shows). I liked Lincoln, and gave it five stars for the acting (3.5 stars for the story), and plus, it's nice to see The Beard back in the game!<br /><br />Lincoln (2012) has my strong recommendation!nd grim, but surprisingly, that is where it succeeds.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have found that this is a fun game to play when I have to wait for an appointment or even just to relax.  Also, my 2 year old god daughter loves when I let her play this game, so it really is nice for any age group!
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This book is about Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. A funny and interesting book because it tells you what happened after the Factory was given to Charlie in the first book. Charlie had been one of the five winners of the 5 Golden Ticket in the first book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This book also tells you what happened to the button-filled Glass Elevator which they rode before entering the factory. Partly sad, because Grandma Georgina turned into<br /> a Minus and Grandpa George into a baby, it is mostly funny for the same reasons!<br /><br />-Lennard Fredric Boholst, 9 yrs old

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book the first time my relationship was struggling and it got us through a rough patch.  That was 15years ago.  I wish I was mature enough to have really grasped all the concepts.  We have recently fallen on rough times again and my wife had an affair.  I have reread  the the book and kick myself for not  applying the principles long term.  Now I have the daunting task of trying to save our relationship . I have hope and confidence that we can work through this with the help of this book.

1400064287|5.0|I am trying desperately to not buy hardcover books as I've simply run out of space.  But, this book I just had to have.  After listening to it via my Audible subscription I liked it so much I bought it.<br /><br />Packed with insight for anyone in marketing, sales, or just if you want to write and convey your message in ways that people will remember.  It is packed with usable and credible examples.<br /><br />I especially like the example of the woman journalist who, on her first day of journalism school was asked to write an opening paragraph for the school newspaper.  The facts were that all the teachers were going to a conference next Thursday, and the conference was in ..., and the conference was all day and they were going to learn xxxx.  After writing her opening paragraph the teacher came to her and said, &#34;you really missed it.  The lead of the story is 'There is no school on Thursday'&#34;  Point being, understand your audience.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I learn best through stories, and this is so well written it is a pleasure to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey seemed like it might bore me at first, like for about 5 minutes.  Then the characters started seeping their way into my heart.  I've had friends who have marveled over the clothes, but it's not my thing and I never even noticed, but apparently they are marvelous.  The characters are much larger than anything.  It addresses serious issues that are of that age and universal, yet it never takes itself too seriously.  Dame Maggie Smith is hilarious as the Dowager Countess; acerbic and observant which makes her so much more touching when she comes through with the love that is beneath it all.  Hugh Bonneville is wise and stodgy, yet able to shift with the times, eventually.  Every character is fully realized and it is so well-acted that when I saw an interview with the cast, I was shocked to see that they were actors!  I have one episode left to watch and I can't wait to see what happens and don't want it to be over.  Top notch.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|When I first saw the reviews for Ted,  I think I groaned audibly.  After it was released, it got so many positive reviews,  I thought I should check it out. It tries so hard to be funny, but comes across as crass and dumb.  I wanted to laugh,  I really did.  . . .but it just doesn't work for me.  I was really bummed because I like mark Wahlberg.  I wasn't all that familiar with Seth Macfarlane's other stuff.  Now I am, and will probably steer clear.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent - we have thoroughly enjoyed the dynamics of the series and look forward to watching many more episodes to come.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|So the series is 50 years old. You don't have to rub it in our faces. Not my idea of fun entertainment.
B0049OSQ18|4.0|My oldest son loves the Decemberists and had put several of their songs on a CD for me. I bought the album and still liked the same songs, but lack the patience to keep hearing the album again and again. I like it, but I'll still run back to the 60's, 70's and 80's, DJ!! ;)
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Clear why it got the Oscar.  Great story, sweet movie, hard to believe this happened.  Fun for the whole family
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! Easy to catch on and very exciting. Changing of the boards background is great.  would like better prides do I can afford new players faster without paying extra.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Good app to have when looking for any kind of information.  I've used it many times to prove a point with a friend!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I guess I had preconceived notions of it being more of a comedy.  It was a very quirky movie, which I did like, but was disappointed in Bruce Willis' performance/
1401324649|5.0|As you would expect, there would have been plenty of events and adventures in the life of any centenarian. But Allan Karlsson is exceptional by any standards. You would not believe what he has been trough in his one hundred years on the planet. He has come close to meeting an early, and violent, end on many occasions, and this continues during his latest adventure which commences on his one-hundredth birthday when he climbs out of his bedroom window at the old folks' home to escape from his unwanted party.<br /><br />He has met many world leaders of the twentieth century, and has consequently had a great influence on the history of the world.<br /><br />As the story flips between the events of 2005, following his escape, and the adventures and encounters that he has had down the years, the readers is carried along through much turmoil, knowing that he survives the unsurvivable, because we are living through his hundred-and-first year.<br /><br />The story put me in mind of both Harry Flashman's, amazing adventures of the previous century, and Walter Minion's fantastical adventures of the twentieth century.<br /><br />If you want a good dose of amusement in your 2013 reading, I suggest that you take a look at The Hundred Year Old Man , and then move on to Flashman and the ensuing series, and then on to Walter Minion's Secret Life and Walter Minion's Therapy.<br /><br />Have fun!

B0012FHGCW|3.0|Great job on the uniqueness of the movie. Its a story about a young man trying to find his identity and desiring simplicity in nature. Its like rebelling against the &#34;materialistic&#34; world, but it did not turned out as he would of imagine.

B003VS0CYC|5.0|The first time I saw Robocop I said wow. Even though they got a lot of mistakes.I enjoyed every bit of the story.Like every trilogy it knows when it's time to close but it is still one of my favorites movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Liked the first half but then it just became a tad melodramatic for me.  Over-rated and predictable (I guessed all the twists) in my opinion.  Probably won't bother with the sequel.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Why does it always go back to the carousal when I want to play? Other than that great game. Very Addictive.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Anyway, my review is about the dvd's, not the movies. I love the remastered, and the classics. So, I'm gonna make it short and simple. Picture is choppy in parts. Audio is excellent. My first Blu Ray purchase, I wanted to start off my collection right.  I'm overall happy with the product,. It would have gotten a 5* rating if not for the choppiness.
B007F7XXKA|5.0|The book provides a good overview about the different emerging markets and it goes beyond the BRIC, which is very insightful.
B00A4W3AJC|3.0|From the opening sequence wherein our director Leos Carax (perhaps playing himself, perhaps not) awakens (or only dreams he awakens) in a dark Lynchian hotel room only to grope his way along an artificial wilderness of wallpaper (visual reference to Nic Roeg's Man Who Fell to Earth) towards a secret door hidden in a wall that leads down a long corridor and into a Lynchian movie theatre, we know we are in, well, the land of David Lynch. Unfortunately, this opening sequence that plays like an homage to Lynch (especially the Lynch of Mulholland Drive) promises a more interesting meditation on film history and contemporary reality than the one that Carax actually delivers. Despite that evocative prologue, Holy Motors is not a very complex film really. It is simply the story of an actor, and the film is about a day in the life of that actor. We get to spend an entire day with the very busy Oscar (Carax regular Denis Lavant) as he rides in a limo from location to location, and from part to part. We never see any producers or directors or cameras or crew, all we know is that he receives scripts (or assignments) from some unknown agency and that his performances begin as soon as he exits the limo. It must be said that Lavant is an extremely visceral and versatile performer. In the course of one working day, he plays a street person with a severe slouch, a stunt man, a sewer troll, an assassin, an accordion player, an actor playing a death scene from a Henry James novel, a father, and someone's old flame etc...Suffice it to say, he is the kind of actor who wants to spend as little time as possible being himself (unless, of course, you view the playacting as opportunities to, in fact, be himself, and this is certainly a distinct possibility). The film wants to be a meditation on the art of acting (and perhaps on acting as existential condition) but it also wants to be a meditation on our uses of film to escape (and/or expand) that existential condition. Certainly the digital age offers us more and more elaborate and more and more immersive ways to both escape and become ourselves. But in this particular film, there is so little connective tissue between performances, so little chance to reflect upon them, that it's hard to tell precisely what Carax wants the cumulative effect of these performances to be. Like Mulholland Drive, Holy Motors functions as a meditation on our ability to play more than one part and live in more than one reality (or simulation of reality) at a time (and on art, specifically cinema, as a kind of ontological enabler) but where Mulholland Drive succeeds in thoroughly excavating its singular subject's dreams and desires only to reveal the seedy reality seething beneath the Hollywood veneer, Holy Motors never really probes its central character's consciousness and so we never know why he is an actor or what motivates his performances or how he may view the connection between his own performances and movie history. Granted, some of the performances are quite interesting (my personal favorite is the sewer troll who kidnaps a fashion model and this very funny sequence is maybe the funniest thing I've seen on film this year) but the individual sequences seem like individual tableux more than parts of a synergisitc whole. And, as it turns out, the troll sequence was indeed originally made as a short film (and included in the omnibus collection entitled Tokyo). A friend of mine who is a big fan of Carax defended the film by saying Carax is a director of moments, but, I argued back, in order for a film to be succesful the moments/the individual performances have to add up to something and in this film they do not. After each performance (each of which plays like a separate short film) our actor simply moves onto another performance and then another performance. Sometimes the performances are merely comic, other times they are disturbingly real as in the scene when Lavant plays father to a teenage girl. In this scene, we are uncertain if the actor is acting or playing out a scene from his own life or some comnbination thereof (and this is compelling). But Carax seems content to leave it at that and to simply leave us wondering what the significance of this scene might be. And so rich and resonant as each performance might be, the actor remains a cipher throughout the film---we are given no way to connect to him, no access to who he is (other than through his performances which reveal nothing specific). It would seem that Carax is more interested in being clever (and foregrounding his clever homages to other art films---which sometimes veer perilously close to parody) than in making any real point about the mysteries or origins of art or identity or culture (or cinema). In other words, for all its trippiness, Mulholland Drive does, in the end, add up to something quite extraordinary and insightful (and offers a frightening but facinationg glimpse into the psychic processes of one highly delusional discontent) whereas Holy Motors simply does not add up to anything specific enough to merit much reflection. Even that opening scene that features Carax standing in the balcony of a movie theatre in his pajamas (by far the best scene in the film) pales in comparison to the Club Silencio scene in Mulholland Drive. Carax is ultimately less interested in making you think than in inviting you to giggle as you identify reference points (Lynch, Roeg, Lynch, Lang, Lynch, Fellini, Lynch, Antonioni, Lynch, Godard, Lynch, Demy, Lynch). And Lavant is just the guy--the human or subhuman cipher-- who will do whatever Carax wants him to. The individual performances might leave you breathless, but the overall effect will leave you groping in the dark for something that isn't there. Each critic that reviews this film seems to fill in its absences for themselves and to see in them exactly what they want to see.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The film does have the potential to be what some viewers seem to want it to be (existentially complex), but despite all that guesswork (is he still acting?, is this really him now?) the ending undermines the complexity it works so hard to build. The ending (or double-ending: monkey house and limo garage) both suggest that Oscar (Lavant) is just a performing monkey and that the limos are more reflective than their charges. So the whole thing becomes a postmodernist joke. The only question is whether Carax really buys this hokum about the end of individual subjectivity or if he is parodying that as well. It would seem that Carax is undecided as to whether he wants us to see Oscar as a man or as some posthuman X. And that indecision about what kind of vision of humanity or posthumanity he wants to put forth prevents this interesting film from becoming a profound one.re uncertain if the actor is acting or playing out a scene from his own life or some comnbination thereof (and this is compelling).

B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I'm not a huge 5 star rater, I usually go with four unless I find something just absolutely amazing. This game is SO much fun. It's colorful, energetic, bright, and just absolutely addictive. The only thing in the game I can see that costs actual money so far is if you want to buy extra coins, but there is really no need as they provide you several in game ways to earn coins, as well as social media ways (liking on Facebook, pairing with Twitter, etc.). This game is a MUST have.

1592407889|4.0|I think it took a lot of courage to write this story , and it had to be depressing to see on paper that one is the progeny of two selfish and uncaring individuals who simply do not value you . Sachi's mother did not believe mothering to a valuable commitment of her energy, time , or talents. As a matter of fact , Sachi probably felt she was viewed as an impediment to her mother's goals and activities . Shirley should have put her daughter up for adoption to parents who would have loved her , given the history that shows she had almost no interest in parenting .<br />Having two parents who do not value you is a difficult burden and hard to overcome , even if the parents are \\"stars \\".<br />  The story is not a hatchet job , is well told , and is kinder to Ms McClain than she deserves .
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great pictures, options for difficulty and best of all, it doesn't constantly crash.<br /> I'm not buried in ads either. Good app, worth the download.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A fine American warrior !<br />A great read will keep you glued to the action ! Its so sad Chris is gone, he could have done so much more for this country, here at home !!
B000O77RLE|2.0|Clint Eastwood is old as hell. He spent like 15 minutes at the 2012 Republican convention talking to a chair. He's dumb enough to consider himself a Republican in the first place.<br /><br />This movie was made a few years before that speech. It is arthritic and childlike, like an old person's home.<br /><br />But I'm going to start with the good. The good is the long-shots of the Iwo Jima volcanic landscape. The idea itself is great, as I've seen enough films from the American perspective. It is interesting seeing advancing American forces from the other perspective, because no one can beat the Americans.<br /><br />Now for the bad. The bad is that the movie bends over backwards to depict the Japanese soldiers as noble and human. This is another culture, so there is a certain hand-off treatment that goes towards the Japanese, but the movie is much worse for it. The movie literally begins with like an Olympic horse galloping on Iwo Jima, and the Japanese play-acting the American invasion like a game of flag football. Everything is a little too clean, the soldiers are too quick to smile, they don't act like the hardened soldiers that they are. It feels like summer camp. Just small things, like how the clothes look immaculately dry-cleaned, there is an utter lack of a \\"lived-in\\" feel to it.<br /><br />They have a humanitarian general leading them, who calls off any military discipline and readily calls for retreat. They have soldiers are martyrs for social consciousness and saving little puppy dogs. We see a Japanese officer literally calling for empathy for a wounded American, even while their morphine supplies are low. This feels like The Passion of the Japanese Christs.<br /><br />When the American invasion starts, things get a little better. The Americans outnumber and outgun the Japanese. So there's a sense of a doomed cause. Since the movie is voiced in Japanese, hearing the enemy speaking familiar English is a neat effect on the viewer.<br /><br />But then there are a number of inexplicable events. There is a gory suicide scene where a number of soldiers commit suicide by hugging hand grenades. This is completely nonsensical. The battle has only just started and they're already committing suicide? And if they want a warrior's death, wouldn't it make sense to go out guns blazing, charging American troops with the bayonet?<br /><br />At least the ending is somewhat interesting. I haven't seen flag of our fathers, but I suspect that you see flag of our fathers characters in the final scene. It's structured so you see that the crazed Japanese soldier, attacking with a shovel American soldiers armed with guns, was the result of some honor for the dead thing.<br /><br />What I thought was most missing from this movie was a strategic view. It could have been written to depict the Japanese planning out a series of traps for the Americans, and then executing those traps in a scrambling manner until the final Bonzai. That would have been interesting. It would have been fun. Instead, you get basically amateur hour, a boy scout troop being sent to war. It is strange how bad this movie is when there are so many good German movies about WWII. Downfall and Das Boot are far superior movies. I do have a nagging suspicion that the reason why the Japanese are so awful in this movie is that, compared to Germany, Japan has a much more limited military in the current day, and so there simply isn't as much military experience.<br /><br />This is a pretty bad movie. Skip it.
B003QS67F0|2.0|This movie was intriguing but there was no redeeming value to the plot.  Both men were evil and only looked out for themselves which made it hard to like either one of them.  Yes, the plot was interesting, but I didn't feel satisfied when the movie was over, just kind of depressed.
0547564651|5.0|Not just a theory, but a compilation of longitudinal studies and observations about what actually works and what doesn't in education.  Lots of details about why other supposedly successful educational strategies show short term results, or why some successful strategies don't produce the magic that overwhelms years of training in an educational desert.<br /><br />An essential book for educators and people setting government policy.
B00514HDNW|5.0|One the best stories I've ever read!  The movie was nowhere near as good.  I actually liked the movie before I read the book and the book then made me hate the movie.  It was such a unique story and it's a shame they couldnt display it on film.
B000THEK8W|5.0|Not sure how anyone can get so good at the trumpet, as a fledgling player I tend to call her naughty names as she plays I'm so jealous.  I'd give it 6 stars, if there wasn't annoying background harpsichord and other ensemble music that just is totally outshone by her performance.  :)

B003GK2216|5.0|Starting with &#34; The Pillars of the Earth&#34; and following on with &#34; World without End&#34; is a feast for history and church architectural lovers. If you love beautiful buildings and their design, then it is well worth the long read and the hours spent soaking up the rich history of the English church  and court manouvres of this era. The research of the 11 th century alone must have been mind boggling let alone the assembling of all the facts and practices of those early religeous times. The machinations and manouvres of Mother Church alone leave one gasping let alone the conniving of people of the villages who burnt and pillaged for their own gain. A series well worth reading.
3836503050|5.0|This book is fantastic, and has had a home on my coffee table ever since I bought it. Elvgren is my favorite pin up artist, and this is a wonderful book for any fan, either of the artist himself or of the female form. The illustrations are beautifully reproduced, and the history is interesting and informative. Plus this book includes a lot of Elvgren's lesser-known work!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|An absolute thrill ride that hits all of the right notes, especially for those geeks, nerds, & fanboys (& -girls) who remember the feel-good shows, movies, music, & games of the 80s! Ready Player One is an engaging, exciting sci-fi adventure that is completely drenched in wonderful, nerdy nostalgia!
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Worth watching.<br />Though guidelines for reviewing regarding number of words is annoying. I need eight more, now four more words.

1609611543|5.0|As an RN extremely interested in nutrition a doctor with whom I work recommended this book to me. I have been gluten free for a month now. I am able to stay up 2-3 hours later each night. I am of a normal BMI already but my face has become thinner and I've lost about 3 lbs. I have recommended this book to many friends and family. It is an extremely informative read that all of the US should be aware of and all healthcare providers aught to read.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Visual effects were very impressive, but the story was shallow and really a copy of Brother Bear.  Brave was very funny at times, but not one of Pixar's best by any means.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The animation is top notch. The story line is riveting.  Peter Weller pulls off Batman well and the action scenes are outstanding.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It is a great memory game.  Very simple to play.  All you have to do is match the symbols until the cube is no more.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Slow to start but overall a good movie worth a watch when it was on sale but couldn't recommend full price for a rental.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|The Scorch Trials is a great continuation to The Maze Runner in my opinion. I'm over half way done with the book and looking forward to starting the fourth book. I can't really say this book is for everyone cause not everything is. I was on the ropes with this series in the beginning only because a lot of people complained and gave bad reviews to the first book solely on the fact that people were confused by the language the Gladers has come up with as well as other various reasons. I decided to read it anyway and make my own determination. I myself couldn't put it down and as I cannot say that it's better than the Hunger Games and or Divergent series, it really is a great series all of its own.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|After a shipwreck, a young man will have to deal with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan a 450 pounds tiger and the fury of the elements in a little boat.<br /><br />An ambitious film where you'll find philosophical and spiritual reflections about the human condition and life.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed. A film to be watched by all the family. Don't miss it!
0786891416|5.0|I like the TV format very much, so while I was very interested in the books, I had a fear they would not be able to move very far from the scripts.  Was I wrong!  Yes there are similarities, but the sstoryline are complimentary, not duplicates.  The differences become greater from book to book.
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I am not the most romantic person, but this movie had stolen my heart.<br />Besides the amazing photography and story of Jane Eyre, the acting is incredible.<br />I have laughed and I have cried... What more do you want from a movie?
B007OAAK0O|5.0|For Diana Ross fans that have been longing to get their hands on this concert in New York, this is truly a treasure. Many video copies have circulated for years but not in very good quality. The packaging is great but could have included a booklet telling of it's inception and climatic troubles. Supposedly a couple of songs are missing.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very well made, great if you listen to the dialogues, if you expect a fast paced one you will be disappointed.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This is one of the best trilogies ever made.  Though Jurassic Park 1 is by far the best the other two can be entertaining.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|For a prequal to Alien, I'll will be very upset if they don't complete and do a part 2 and 3 of this movie.  It was awesome.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's an amazing book, and makes the reader thinks about a lot of things, especially if they're young. It makes you feel infinite.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Different from the first one, but still entertaining.  It gets bad reviews, but to pass an hour and a half, it's not bad.  I did enjoy it and i'd really give it 3 1/2 stars for enjoyment.  It's probably a 3 star OKAY movie, but people tend to rip this one so I'm going 4 with it.
B000M343BM|5.0|Major League one Wild Thing is the best baseball comedies  ever made. An all star cast led by badboy Charlie Sheen who is now da man. He is backed up by Tom Berenger & Corbin Bernsen when he was the man. Also costarring Rene Russo, Margaret Whitton and James Gammon as the team manager Lou. But it's baseball's funniest former player Bob Uecker as play by play announcer Harry Doyle who steals the show.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|Some people got together and said, &#34;Let us make a crap movie that will draw in the sci fi people, get their money, and dissapoint the hell out of them.&#34;  So it was done.....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The time period and the setting are so interesting as is the dichotomy between the household staff and the family. The charachers are also developed well- just imagining what is going on in their heads is half the fun.  A lot happens in this season as well. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions in season 3!
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Let's get a bunch of high profile actors who can't act together and make a movie that only meat heads will enjoy.  You know?  Those stupid people at the gym who scream everytime they curl a dumbell.
1594481717|4.0|The beginning started off slow to me but that is because I was already aware of most of the information he presented. It picks up in the middle.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I believe it.  Great actors playing great roles, but just didn't bite my enthusiasm. If you disagree, and you've seen it, I doubt you were raving about it the next day at work.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|As a child, growing up in Colorado during the 1940s and '50s, reading was an escape from the everyday life of school and daily chores.  Two authors stand out in my memory as major influences on my interest in adventure and the natural world. One was Edgar Rice Burroughs, the other was Jack London.  The first time I read The Call Of The Wild I was totally blown away.  In Buck I found the ultimate animal hero surviving in a savage world.  Since that time I have re-read this book many times and with each re-reading I came away with something new.  In time I would see things in the narrative that I had never noticed before.  This is indeed a multi-level book, giving you glimpses of London's philosophy on life.  How he used Buck as a sounding board to voice his own feelings on man's place in the universe, the meaning of honor, courage and loyalty.  London wrote with the knowledge gained from living a life of adventure.  Ranching, panning for gold in the Yukon, at sea he was an oyster pirate and a sealer and, for a time, bummed around as a hobo.  Basically the story is a simple one, following Buck from his soft life in California to his new life as a sled-dog the frozen north.  During his transformation Buck would meet many men, some good, some bad, all shaped by the brutal life they lived.  Buck would also meet all kinds of dogs from the soft southerners to the savage wolf-like northerners.  And he would have an enemy--a large, white Siberian husky named Spitz.  In this world of snow and ice Buck would be forged into powerful fighter and a sled-dog without peer.  London's narrative is brutal and straight forward as he traces Buck's metamorphosis from pet to killer.  There are scenes of incredible savagery and scenes of mystery: the fight to the death between Buck and Spitz; fire-visions of Buck's prehistoric self and the strange half-man that shared a long ago camp fire with him.  London may be guilty of anthropomorphism as he endows Buck with feelings of pride, sorrow,love and hate but the story has stood the test of time and will continue to do so as long as there are readers who love nature and hear the siren Call Of The Wild.<br />I had no problems with this Kindle edition.<br />LastRanger
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I enjoyed this.  More serious than I thought it would be.  Could have used a touch more humor, but a fun and fast paced movie.  They don't wait around on this one.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Highlights were Bruce Willis and Ed Norton. Little disappointed with Bill Murray's character because I love Bill Murray and he should comprise at least 1 hour of every movie. Moonrise Kingdom is okay.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It has ben afflack.  If he could act, this would easily be a 4 star movie.  He just talks his way through movies.  He acts the same in every movie almost.

B008476HBM|1.0|I had always said when I retired and had time that I would read a lot of the  classics.  Well, this won't be one of them.  I just couldn't get in it.  I hope the rest of them aren't as boring.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I LOVED the book - but was disapponted in the ending.  It was very possibly a true story, and then when I read the ending, it was disappointing that they had to stick this &#34;ghost&#34; feature in there.  Other than that, it was a great story.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|This album had it all dance heart & soul not a bad thing I could say about it.. A Must Have Album!

1592403913|5.0|A unique series reflecting on the unique aspects of our language in written form. It also highlights how poorly we are educated on the mechanics of our language and how powerful it really is.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Great book it will make your heart race at times and you cry at other times would recommend the book to a woman
B003O86FMW|4.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat and very entertaining.  I literally couldn't put it down until it was finished.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I tried every solitaire download out there. This is the best....period. the others are flimsy looking and the response time is awesome on this one.
B000002G9S|5.0|If one were interested in this band, this would be the one to get. The band was tight and it includes one of the greatest rock songs of all time, &#34;All Right Now&#34;. The cut on the album is even better than the radio edit because it is longer. Rodgers has such an expressive voice and Kossoff had a totally unique guitar sound. This album is one of my all-time favorites.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book!  Engaging from Page 1.  Lots of twist and turns -- a real page-turner.  I didn't want it to end!

0525953590|5.0|This book reports on the quest to complete the \\"Standard Model\\" of physics by adding to it the most recent findings of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It gives a rather detailed non-mathematical summary of the state of particle and quantum physics up to July 4, 2012, the date of the reporting of the most recent LHC experiment. It also gives a summary of the associated politics and backbiting that led up to the development of the LHC. Since the main substance of the book is concerned mainly with trying to understand the meaning of the physics involved more than the politics, for my own purposes, I have decided to only focus on that aspect of the book in this review.<br /><br />A brief and unavoidably rough summary of what Professor Carroll has revealed is this: Physical reality as we understand it today is summarized in the \\"Standard Model\\" of physics, which explains everything we experience in our everyday lives except gravity, which without much fuss or lost of generality is tacked on to the tail end of the model.<br /><br />Physical particles come in two types: those that make up matter (fermions); and those that carry force (bosons). The difference between them is that fermions occupy space while bosons do not. Indeed, the very fact that they do not occupy space is one of the main reasons bosons can carry force. Force, in the context of the Standard Model means \\"interactions\\" or \\"exchanges\\" of particles; or, alternatively, what results when particles vibrate in their respective fields. Ultimately, we learn from the book that a \\"Higgs boson\\" (or Higgs force\\") is just a vibration in the \\"Higgs field,\\" just as a photon vibrates in the electromagnetic field. Aside from Higgs, which refers both to a force and to its associated field, there are four kinds of forces in nature -- each with its own boson particles.<br /><br />First there is gravity, which has the graviton. Then there is electromagnetism, which has a charge that is the boson force associated with the photon. Finally, there are the strong and weak nuclear forces. The strong nuclear force is associated with gluons, and the weak nuclear forces (a bit messier than the others) has three different kinds of bosons (or electrical charges) associated with them: the W +, W-, and the Z bosons. Of the four forces, only the bosons of the weak force can change the identity of the particles they interact with, which is problematic in the context of  understanding the full implications of the standard model. The reason this is problematic is because unlike the other forces, these bosons constitute or signal a break in symmetry; however, so far, no compelling reason or principle seems to account for this symmetry-breaking -- or, for that matter, even the existence of the three separate bosons.<br /><br />Two Pivotal Concepts<br /><br />The reader may recall, that the concept of \\"symmetry,\\" along with the idea of a \\"field,\\" are the two most compelling heavy-lifting abstractions used in physics, ones that experimentalists and mathematicians invariably lean on to guide their theory-making as well as for peering into the unknown. When a symmetry-breaking event occurs in nature, invariably it signals a qualitative if not a quantum change in some aspect of nature itself. The most trivial example of symmetry breaking for instance occurs when water changes from a liquid, to a gas, to ice with mere changes in temperature. Each change in its state represents a breaking of symmetry. And in an exactly analogous way, as the universe cooled in the wake of the Big Bang, symmetry-breakings occurred that signaled quantum as well as qualitative changes in nature itself. The normal state of nature is for \\"symmetry to hold\\" in which case nothing out of the ordinary happens. That is to say, things operating under the same transformations are expected to have the same behavior.<br /><br />In addition to the concept of symmetry there also is the important concept of a \\"field,\\" which is an abstraction of forces -- visualized in theory as lines of force pervading space in every direction. A field is a theoretical entity posited to have values at every point in space. The four forces of nature also have fields associated with them. And according to quantum field theory, absolutely everything is made up of these fields or of a combination of them. In fact, what we call particles, we are now learning from quantum field theory, are just tiny vibrations in their respective boson fields. A good shorthand summary of quantum field theory is this: \\"When we are NOT looking the particles are actually waves; when we ARE looking they are particles.\\" And just as sound waves propagate through the air, vibrations propagate through quantum fields (even though what we apprehend or see, are particles). Thus, no one should be surprised that it is the \\"Higgs Field\\" rather than the \\"Higgs force\\" that is the Standard Model's main concern.<br /><br />The Higgs Field, unlike other fields is this strange aspect of reality that has the quality that when it is at rest it has a non-zero energy level? Among other things, this means it has an asymmetric effect on the particles attached to it. Said somewhat differently, this means that particles that appear the same in a Higgs boson force field actually break symmetry and get differential treatment as individual particles. The result of symmetry breaking thus is that some of the fundamental particles of nature that encounter the Higgs field act differently than those that do not. And since all of the universe is involved here, this is no small matter.<br /><br />Investigation of the Problem<br /><br />The hammer of choice for breaking apart the protons (one of the many particles used as the rocks of matter) to reveal its ultimate constituents is of course the \\"atom smasher,\\" or in today's terms, the high energy accelerator or Electron-Positron collider. It is a device, that when it uses a fast moving bullet like a neutron or a proton to smash a targeted particle -- depending on its speed and power -- will leave a trail of debris that if we are lucky, sometimes will include new elements predicted by theory, or even some that have not been predicted by theory and that have never before been seen in nature. Particle physics is about statistics and almost everything you can see in a detector, there is more than one way to make it happen. Thus the trick of atom smashing is to compare the rate you should expect against the rates you might get with a newer particle. So the greater the uncertainty, the more runs must be made and the more data must be collected.<br /><br />When the dust settled on the fourth of July 2012, this is precisely what happened in the case of a test run of the LHC. Judging by the energy levels predicted, versus those recorded, of the debris resulting, a we can conclude with a high degree of probability that a discovery apparently was made for the first time of the existence of the Higgs boson force field. At the very least the readings recorded appeared consistent with what theories had predicted they would be if such a force field actually existed in nature. The most immediate job of follow-up work then is to confirm that this is in fact the case. If it is confirmed, this will be a triumph for science and for those countries that had the foresight and will to commit the resources needed to continue explorations deep into the frontiers of science.  The country that used to take such risks was the U.S.A. However to today it take only safe bets like in investing in \\"credit default swaps. Five Stars
B0076DELIG|3.0|It just has not kept my interest Like most Michael Connelly books have. As explained for preview, the persistence and tenacity of Harry Bosch is admirable(as always), but you can't help but wonder why he would use his own funds and vacation time to followup on a 20 year old unsolved murder. I suppose he felt he owed to deceased lady and especially her living relative plus they were trying to take him off the case. So I answered my own question.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Beautiful prose, with certain sentences that touched my heart with their gentle and insightful wisdom.  Multi-dimensional characters and an artfully constructed story.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|For a first novel - it was very good. Very well written in the main - a little overstatement/over-emphasis in parts. The story line was very intriguing and kept your interest throughout. It was hard to put down. Now I'm off and keen to read the rest of the Reacher novels.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a very addicting series, wish it wasn't so long until season 4.  I am somewhat new, having bought season 1 & 2 on DVD in the last year, never watched on television.  It took me awhile to get into it, probably because there were so many people I couldn't keep them all straight.  I didn't start to get addicted until season 2, then went back and watched season 1 again.  It was more enjoyable the 2nd time.  I ordered season 3 as soon as they announced it would be coming out.  The only things not likeable about season 3 were the deaths of 2 major characters.  It is a high quality program, something television could use a lot more of.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Ben Affleck did an excellent job re-creating the '70s, not my favorite decade (gas lines, gold and avocado green decor, disco clubs).<br />I had a hard time separating the cheesy '70s sets from the plot.  Luckily, most of the film took place in  a grim Iran.<br />Argo did not deserve Best Picture at the Oscars.<br />I would recommend Argo to the 6 hostages who escaped, the hostages who spent 444 days held in the American embassy, Jimmy Carter, the CIA, and the Canadians who hid the quarrelsome 6 in their embassy.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Ok - so it's not full of plot twists or meaning. It's goofy, stereotyped, and predictable, but it's fun and carefree and great for a girls night in.  That's all we wanted and it was fun.
B00107FV4C|5.0|This isn't really the kind of movie that has a big audience or that I can really suggest to many people, but if you like Lars von Trier then you should definitely see this. It's not his absolute best, but it's great and definitely worth a watch. It's done in a very unique style and that alone makes it worth seeing.
B000001GMX|2.0|The tracks on the CDs were mostly marked incorrectly, and many were not marked at all.  The artist takes a very eclectic approach to the suites, with many ornaments I'd not heard on the other versions (Casals, Starker, Ma, Shostakovitch, etc.)  It will take many more hearings to get used to them, much less decide if this lowly listener likes them.  I didn't realize this was the German release -- probably my fault.<br /><br />The seller could have noted the incorrect track markings.
1401937519|5.0|When I had a near death experience the experts who've looked at this phenomena for decades told me about a study which induced NDE in volunteers by stimulating different parts of the brain with Ultrasound.  Then I found out they were all atheists, which means I definitely travelled to heaven and they couldn't have; because Jesus only appears to people who already believe he exists.  Now THAT is science.<br /><br />My favourite part about this book, is where Anita goes into all the detailed studies which have been carried out into NDE, and shows that they're all wrong according to her own personal and expert testimony; written in exactly the same accessible style as all the reader reviews of this book on Amazon.<br /><br />Everyone knows that when you believe something is true, it becomes true -- even if there is no \\"evidence\\" for it.  This book is a point by point rebuttal of every single \\"rational\\" argument against NDE, which are only ever made by people who don't believe in Anita's evidence anyway!<br /><br />All in all I'd say this book is a masterpiece.  It told me everything I wanted to hear about something I already believe in, AND went the extra mile in talking down all the \\"experts\\" with heartfelt personal and therefore objectively valid proof that science doesn't know how to talk the language of Yahweh; the one true God which I just so happen to have been brought up to believe in, and who came to me in a shaft of light the night I didn't die.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|because I enjoy it and use it often to get in touch with friends far away like in the uk.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really awesome book you all should read it. All about how to no over react and to not drop a friend for a girl
B000HT38AS|3.0|....but crappy movies. These three Clint Eastwood movies have got to be the CHEESIEST movies he's ever made! The only redeeming element of Pink Cadillac was Bernadette Peters! What a FOX! Honkytonk was just awful! Clint Eastwood CAN NOT SING! I felt nothing but embarrassment for him! These 3 movies were on the same level  as &#34;Any which way but loose&#34;  and &#34;Any which way you can&#34;. Five of Clint Eastwood's worst self produced flix. Better left forgotten in lost memories.
B0084AZXKK|2.0|I couldn't  understand the book. To much pirate talk. It's An ok book, but it takes a lot of time to read.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and funny.  As long as you aren't offended by the sexual innuendos, I would highly recommend it!
0060987464|5.0|I recommend this book to any Manson fan. It's a nice insight to his childhood and early years. He has a great sense of humor that makes this book that much more enjoyable.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I just started watching The Walking Dead.  I had to purchase the additional episodes that weren't On Demand.  I enjoy this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's free and fun what more could you ask for?  It's addicting as hell.  The graphics are great as well
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I don't know what happened that this game no longer works in kindle. It won't ever get off the downloading screen once the game is opened.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fascinating look at a bygone era with so much action, it will cause you to look forward to the next episode in this continuing saga. .
0449227421|1.0|I have loved almost everything that Ken Follett wrote but \\"The Third Twin\\" is impossibly bad. It is as  unbelievably bad as Robert Ludlum's \\"Osterman Weekend\\" Let's hope it was an attempt to see if he could write like Ludlum at his worst.
B00B2QA646|1.0|The costumes are gorgeous.  That said, the rest of the movie was very disappointing.  The theatre scene changes give the weird effect of some type of drugged dream.  The viewer is never quite sure where the various parts of the theatre will lead.  I suppose that it was intended to be a clever presentation but felt odd and disjointed.  The raw materials were certainly available in terms of a classical tale, actors, and window dressing but were never brought to any kind of fruition.  I never fall asleep while watching a new movie and this one put me to sleep twice.  Sad.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I rented this for my kids and especially my daughter, she loves Tangled a lot, I had to buy the movie so she can watch it all the time when she wants.
B00000ILBK|3.0|I just caught this on television. This is the one Next Generation movie I missed when it came to the theater. I really didn't miss much it seems. This movie is standard fare as far as Star Trek Next Generation goes. The plot is pretty thin and the villains seem tame to me. There is way too much Data as usual and most of the supporting cast get very few lines in this movie. By 1998 the cast was getting a little long in the tooth as well. When I see Data with age lines you know it is time to wrap things up. I guess Paramount was trying to milk the franchise for all it was worth and they did pay for it eventually.
B00AY0A71I|4.0|John Cleese and Jami Lee Curtis make this movie.  Found the movie to be not only funny, but very relaxing as well.
1250006341|5.0|Great show.  This book is the perfect coffee table book that when family member and friends come over they have to pick up!
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|10 minutes into the movie you understand he is an alcoholic. For an hour following they are still reinforcing that fact.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down, and read it in one day you just gotta love a bad boy!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I enjoy Daniel Craig as a Bond, and liked the stunts and overall movie, but I continue to be disappointed in streaming quality.  When showing large areas of dark or even just background black color, the color comes across like various shades of pixilated watercolors layered on top of each other - not a consistent one color if seen in true HDTV or DVD. HD streaming is not much improvement over regular streaming and certainly not worth the extra cost.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|DVD arrived in immaculate packaging within a week of placing my order. Being that this is the directors cut there were several scenes added that really fleshed out certain aspects of the story. Possibly the most original and visionary piece of cinema ever made. I could watch this movie a hundred times and take something new from it each time.
0307592731|5.0|I highly recommend this well written book about the author's experience hiking much of the Pacific Crest Trail. She describes not only the scenery but details about her adventures along the way, meeting wild animals and fellow hikers on the trail. Intertwined with her experiences on the hike are flashbacks to her reasons for doing the difficult route by herself. Her earlier life, including triumphs and heartache, were fascinating to me. She has a strong spirit and determination to overcome obstacles that you can't help but admire.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I might have missed it in the description, but my discs are actually Region 2 that come out of Europe, but there's nothing different between the films, so I'm happy with my purchase.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|This is an incomplete port.  If you want the level editor you're going to have to dust off your Dreamcast or GBA versions.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A very good show.  A good mix of action, humor, and science fiction.  I love the Walter Bishop character, very funny.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|I wish all the puzzles were in one location, just having to choose a level, rather than broken down into so many categories,  but still a great app.
1433524708|3.0|My comments only pertain to the cover, not the Bible version/content.  The book I received had a brown cover.  If you turn your head sideways and squint real hard, you can maybe sorta imagine that there is some sort of green tone to the color - maybe.  But my eyes looked at it and they said &#34;THAT'S BROWN&#34;!  Now, if a predominantly brown color is what you want, then this is the thing for you.  But if you really want something in the green family, then not so much.
B008220C38|5.0|With Kiera Knightley starring as the complex heroine, Joe Wright directing and music by the sublime Dario Marianelli the stage is set for a spectacular movie and Anna Karenina rightly delivers. If you're a fan of other collaborations of this sort including Atonement and Pride and Prejudice than you will not be disappointed with this film. Wright uses the theme of a play in order to set up the world of the Russian aristocrats playing up the facade of the society and juxtaposing it with the truth found in nature. This greatly enhances the meaning of the film and allows Tolstoy's masterpiece to easily be translated into film. The cinematography is beautiful, the music divine, and the costuming just spot on. All of this acts as a great support to the actors. Matthew MacFadyen, playing Anna's brother Oblonsky, adds a great support to Knightley as seen in their last film together Pride and Prejudice. Karenin, played by Jude Law, stepping out of his element has just the right seriousness and empathy to play the part.<br /><br />If you love films that are artistic, beautiful and passionate than this is the film for you.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I read this cover to cover and even took notes while reading it.  I just published my first book on Kindle and most of the information that I needed, I found here.  It made it totaly doable!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Itree games that I have are fun and don't punish you with blatant ads. Yep, I occasionally see an ad I like but hate it when you have to click through one every round. This game is fun, pretty typical for a 3 match game.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I have tried numerous times to get this to connect to My facebook, but it won't. Even when I go to the facebook page to start it, it says the game isn't available for My device...please fix this! I am dying to play this game with the ability to save!
B000I9TY4G|5.0|What a fantastic tie in to the short lived but fantastic series. The story line was absorbed into the movie and gave the answers  to questions that were not answered in the series firefly.<br /> this is one movie that would  deserve a sequel.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I liked this enchanting and engrossing tale.  It was not what I expected, and I like that!  It is hard to classify, I'd say it was a whimsical, adventure, suspense story with a mystery to solve.  I think anyone from about 11 - 80 would enjoy and it would appeal to either gender.<br /><br />It kept me reading and it was a book that I hated to finish, because that meant I wouldn't be part of that world anymore.  I read it on my kindle, the pictures were a little hard to see and the hand written notes were very difficult to read, but the author paints such a good picture with his words, I was able to imagine the details in the pictures.  I highly recommend this book.  It is a quick read.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|It's a quite eye-opening and impressive book talking about why and how someone is so successful. It also encourage you robe successful. Worth reading!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|No problems! I haven't had any problems with the program. That is a good thing for me I would of recommend it
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This movie is great, It has a lot of cute moments in it. Made me laugh, overall i am super happy i watched it! ;D
B008YRVW0I|1.0|Was not any fun and was to childish should show a lot age rating. I have nothing else to say
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I watched this movie all the way to the end but should have stopped watching it when it became clear this is about alcoholism.  I feel misled by the trailer and movie description.  It makes it seem that the movie is about a hero saving everyone by taking a risky move to fly a plane upside down.  Instead it is about a functioning alcoholic in which case a more realistic ending would have been the pilot continuing to lie to the very end, getting reinstated, keeping his job, and getting in the cockpit and flying again and again until he kills everyone on the plane and on the ground some two more hours of movie later.  Don't waste your time and money on this.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book captures your interest right from the start.  The story took unusual twists and turns along the way and never failed to surprise me. I especially enjoyed how each chapter was about a different character in the past and present, and how the story was told from their point-of-view.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are just amazing actors and the two of them together is just perfect. This movie is a must see!
B002BWP49M|5.0|The quality of this DVD was great!  I recently got a blue-ray DVD player to play this movie along with the rest of the series.  Very Happy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much can't wait th start next book. I read lots of books and this kept me on my edge. Could not put it down
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Great Album, Bruno Mars is an extremely talented artist who really knows how to shake things up a bit, definitely a steal for 4 bucks as well.
0143113100|5.0|The last third of the book lags a little, considering that the first two thirds had me literally entranced and unwilling to put it down.  So didn't matter to me... The bulk of the book is absolutely fascinating!  I'm always learning, and this book taught me so much I just keep recommending it to people I know.  As one friend of mine said of this book, &#34;It's just another reminder that the sexiest organ in the human body is the brain.&#34;  Yes, yes it is.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|All these  people sniveling over the disk not working should have their reviews deleted.<br />What's the disk problem got to with the quality of the production ....Nada!!<br />Hotel California alone is worth the price of the disk!<br />It's a riveting version with Bill Armstrong's compelling trumpet solo.<br />The horn section with Greg Smith barritone sax,Al Garth - alto sax and violin; Bill Armstrong - trumpet; and Chris Mostert tenor is amazing.<br />Yes Henley's a perfectionist and if you don't like perfect don't buy the disk.<br />Hole in the world is a tribute to 9/11 and good example of what makes the Eagles click with this 5 part harmony  piece.<br />We have a sound system that am thankful for every day.<br />Having seen the Eagles on their last trip to Vancouver this BR was like reliving the night.<br />How can you possibly not give it 5 stars is beyond me.<br />It rates with my top 5 out of 150 BRs.
B004I744AS|5.0|I highly recommend this app for anyone looking for a dictionary that is quick and easy to use. You will not be disappointed!
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I have rated this product as okay because it does measure the Wi-Fi signal but it does not provide a way to improve the signal.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Joaquin Phoenix is quite the actor...very intriguing in this role.  Found myself really focused on his character mostly due to his physicality.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is always wonderful.  Worth watching.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I have seen every James Bond film more than once and I feel the most recent three Bond films are the best. Each actor that has played James Bond has brought a different set of skills to the film industry.  Daniel Craig and Sean Connery are the best.  Daniel Craig would be perfect as Mitch Rapp or Scott Harvath.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|It fits the Kindle only, but it is really not needed.  My kindle travels well without a sleeve, and I find that I never use it.  Pretty much a waste of money.  If you still feel that you need one, this is an good product for what it was intended.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I highly recommend the Weather Channel app and I believe it is the best weather app available in the marketplace today.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a story that I can relate to.  It is a true account of growing up in poverty and ways to overcome  some of the dire circumstances inherent in life when there is never enough money.  Even today in our more affluent society, many people are caught in the  throes  of poverty seeming never to rise above  the situation.  The story  could bring hope to some and recognition that there are solutions available.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|How can one not love Adobe Reader when it is the best app available to read pdf documents on a computer, phone or tablet.
B008VBYN80|3.0|I really like games where u can interact with people u don't know ans get there help, but in this game u can only rely on it friends. And none of my friends would play this game, so I'm permanently stuck.
B004JK61K0|2.0|I downloaded this app since I was unhappy with the Comcast email app for my phone and Kindle.  This app does not provide an option for deleting multiple emails at one time so I cannot endorse it.
1604680547|5.0|I have already used the book.  So many different styles to use on my quilting, both for hand and machine quilting.
B0011BGY66|5.0|All of them. This is one of my favourites. I have listened to this album countless times. At points is has almost an african vibe to it. Very cool. I would say this came in right at the beginning of this indie-softer rock/experimental music phase we are currently experiencing. If you haven't picked this one up yet, do it. I also definitely recommend it on vinyl.
B000003RCY|5.0|i chose this 5 star rating, because my father listens to it all the time lol.  my father loves this album, and listens to it all the time lol.  i recommend this album to anyone that loves german music lol.  this album is pretty good.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I absolutely love Wes Anderson movies, and this is no exception.  It is beautifully filmed, with great dialoge, interesting characters,  and wonderful music. I really love the story and how everything unfolds.  My only complaint is that this is a love story between 2 kids and so it made it very hard to identify with them personally.  I prefer the adult actors in this movie,  whom all dis a wonderful job.  This movie is fun,  and I highly recommend it,  especially if you enjoy slightly off center comedy.
B00005AAFS|5.0|i chose this 5 star rating, because my father loves this c.d., and he listens to it all the time lol.  my father loves this c.d., because he copied the c.d. into his c.d. player in his car, and he listens to it all the time.  i recommend this c.d. that loves german music lol.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I read this book to cope with my 50 Shades and Crossfire hangovers.  I enjoyed it enough to become slightly addicted, but, if you're freshly off a Christian and/or Gideon high, be warned:  the love scenes are much more subdued.  Left me wanting more, looking forward to Walking Disaster.
B0002XDODU|5.0|i chose this 5 star rating, because my father loves this c.d. to :).  my father loves this c.d. to, and he copied it into his c.d., and now he listens to it all the time.  i recommend this c.d. t anyone that loves german music lol :).  there music is pretty good.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I really loved this movie, so bought it for my kindle and then hooked it up to my TV and it was wonderful to watch.  I really am glad I bouight this movie!
B004XQYBA2|4.0|not bad,  very wide choice selection for skill levels, plays well on Droid Bionic, better than some other Sudokus out there
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Deserved the best picture and Ben Affleck should have received the best director award. Cast was excellent. One of the best movies I have seen.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Some books are enjoyable to read and some are a challenge to finish, but occasionally you find a story which is so well written that the words disappear from the page and you become part of the world which the author created. This book is one of the latter. If you enjoy fantasy, sword play, and magic, I challenge you to find a more well written book in this genre.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno did an amazing job this time around.  I absolutely love his style and would buy this album again.  Loved it!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Don't like this app, cannot change news feed to most recent, hard to find anything like I can on the computer.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Talented and a great artist. I had to get the second album! Its not bad that it was a cheap price also.
159562015X|1.0|Ok let me be honest when I saw .70 for the book I barely read anymore about the description. Having then got the book, it looked great, but I got the book based on a recommendation from a friend about the online test. The pull out insert with the online code  that should have came with the book was not there.  Did I fully read that in the description, or read past the part about the insert missing probably and for .70 cents plus shipping I jumped on it... Live and learn, I did in fact get what a paid for...sorry
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was really good. I could not put it down. It really held my attention and I didn't want it to end. Can't wait to check out other books by this author.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It is everything it is supposed to be.<br />I bought it for using it with my Galaxy Note 2 and it works perfectly with the wire. You can also use it wirelessly if you buy the sixaxis app in google play. I can now play all my games with an amazing controller instead of using the screen buttons. I do hope the PS4 can also use this controller too.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is an addictive Game. well. if you don't mind to waste your time., go ahead and play it. jugs dhdh herb ieheh hens
B000I9X67M|5.0|Love this movie and it was an affordable price going through amazon prime rather than apple App Store were this movie would be over priced!! Yes it takes forever to download but it is cheaper!!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel does a gret job portraying addiction.  Very well done and worth watching.  It brings a great understanding of the struggles and the lengths,addictive behavior,will go in order to continue and hide their behavior.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was great! Once I started reading it I could not put it down. From being prior military myself and serving overseas all I can say is thank you to the men and women who sacrifice for OUR Great Country to be free. God Bless the USA!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I thought I was going to hate the walking dead. I was expecting the old zombie moview, but wow - was I pleasantly surprised!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book.... he does it again a truly gifted writer. My granddaughter wants to read it next...she loves Nicholas Sparks books turned into movies
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is a very good book of historical fiction that encompasses the years before and during WWI.  The book follows lives of people in their 20's or so with loyalities to England, Germany, Russia...and how they are affected by the war.  A good read and much historical fact given.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
B0063M22QO|5.0|enjoying it very much. moving up and achieving goals are fun steps that keep from being too much play. I recommend it as a great mind sharpener and time waster. two for one special.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was anxious to read this before I see the movie, sometimes Pat, the mental patient, made more sense that the rest of his family and friends.  I enjoyed this very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome. I love this game and so does my son. It is highly addictive and hard to put down! Enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This kept me reading every night, the problems of the girl were sad but ended well.  A little crazy at time but a good book.
B005CVWWJY|3.0|full of 80's culture<br />quite nostalgic if you born in that era<br />geeky<br />confusing if you are new in the virtual reallity
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Tis game is fantastic everyone should play this game but if you don't Like it that's fine just go get yo life
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought this was an amazing book I can't wait to read the rest of the series good luck percy
1616550414|5.0|Among the many pages of content, there's nothing not to love. The only thing that could have been better is that there could have been even more content (although there's plenty). Also, the focus may be placed a bit too much on recent games and too few on the older ones. I believe this book is a nice addition for the collection anyone who's into Zelda & the Zelda series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the beginning and as I progressed I started to think it was too much about the sexual relationship but I read o. And I liked the storyline behind it and am actually re-reading it now. Couldn't put it down!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|This book was great! It was fast paced and very entertaining. Reminded me of a Criminal Minds episode. I look forward to reading the next one!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is fun and addicting, but having technical issues with the social aspect of the game so I am unable to progress
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I found the book to be thought provoking and easy to comprehend. It led me to some self examination and provided a framework to explore some good changes. I'd recommend this book to someone wanting to make a positive change in their life, or finds their self curious about human processes.
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|he loves these movie I dont but that is  ok this would not be for me I buy newer movies
B00000DHTF|5.0|I love Bruce Springsteen and I am very happy to have this collection of his stuff.  A lot of it is new to me.  A real pleasure.  Any Bruce fan will love this.

B007712XAU|5.0|My husband and I were excited to start the series from the beginning and are now almost through Season 3.  Having the DVD's allowed us to watch it on our time schedule.
0792839730|2.0|for me it was what was I thinking this  I GAVE to my step dad even he did not care for it #%T&^
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The actors and actresses are carried out in Season 3, and real life happenings keep you hooked.  The servants seem to give us more amusement than in the first two seasons!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is one of the  most useful apps I have.  It lets you know how much time you have to read, play videos, watch movies or play games. I highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book got a little predictable, although it helped to finish the story about the evil boss.  I enjoyed the entire series.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Enjoyed the characters in the pilot. I hated the story line in the 2nd week. The graphic murders were gratuitous and unnecessary.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Loved the book and what it represents!  It is worth the anguish of suffering through this warriors story to understand what the American fighting man puts on the line for his country, and I would venture to say few do it like the Navy SEALS!<br /><br />Reading this book is also a pretty good history lesson, and provides a better understanding of the complications of war, it is never black and white and it is always fraught with hard decisions that the people back in the states don't understand.  It is easy for politicians and the news media to pain war and it's participants as good and bad, but the bottom line is that it is what it is and that the man on the ground should be given some latitude to act for his on survival.<br /><br />Take the time and give it a read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Jk!  I couldn't stop watching this show until I ran out of episodes.  Each season and each episode have been great.  It is always so suspenseful keeping me on the edge of my seat and at the same time, there is so much depth to each of the characters.  Great writing and acting!
B009POHHRG|4.0|An amazing graphic novel that I will for sure 're read multiple times. The illustrations were simply fantastic and amazing. This is a must read!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Trust me I have seen them all since the early 60's. This is the best Bond of all time with realistic special effects.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|This book was split into two different parts.  The part set during the Holocaust was fantastic.  I am the granddaughter of 2 Holocaust survivors and know very well what happened to Jews when they were round up and in camps.  In this part, de Rosnay did a great job of being accurate and painting a very good picture.  It was the current day part that I did not love.  I did not like the characters and couldn't really connect with them and I found the story a bit hard to believe.  The ending was a total let down because I just didn't buy it.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Some do not agree but I feel that this series shows a different area of the Federation.  Some of the stories are dry but overall they are captivating.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Rather than buying an extra travel alarm clock, I downloaded this AP to my Kindle.  Was easy to use and display also served as a night light (kept my Kindle plugged in so as to not drain battery).
B009IH0ICG|4.0|Yep, I like these things.  They come in very handy for starting coals.  Will write more about it later, after I use it.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Bought this for a new mini-ITX build for my sister.  Paired this with an ASROCK FM2A85-X, Crucial Ballistix low profile 8GB DDR3-1600, Cooler Master Gemini II M4, InWin BP655, Syba SY-MRA55005 Multipurpose 5.25&#34; Bay Adapter. WD Black 750GB laptop HDD and generic BD-ROM/DVD-RW drive.  Got as high as 25 degrees (using CoreTemp) during the setup and O/S+program installation.  Played back a 20GB mt2s file (recorded NFC Championship game and converted to AVCHD) with no problems or dropped frames.<br /><br />The fans never once got too loud.  I don't know how the stock cooler would have fared (it does come with a cooler), but I like my computers to be as quiet as possible.  For the price this is a super product.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story will really capture your heart.  It's a little racy in places, but not enough to discourage reading it for the story alone.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just finished this a week ago. Bought it for my phone and tablet/laptop.<br /><br />It was a good story though I didn't expect it to be on the same time frame as the previous. It makes since cause of so much going on in the story.<br /><br />Wish the last two were done to continue. Need something good now to replace this.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I thought the book was well written.  It is a great story of some of the unusual positive things that happen in wartime.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought this for my phone and tablet/laptop. Just recently finished the the last book too.<br /><br />It was great to read, though I wish the last two books were done so I didn't have to wait.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I read this one in one go. I could not put it away!<br />If you like Fantasy in its best this is for you. I can hardly wait for the sequel!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Replaced my i3 with this. Works great and I have had it a few months. I wanted to upgrade a few parts to extend my computers life. I can do if not double then triple the work using this CPU. I also got this at a great price so very happy.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I would not recommend it.  It broke after a year and so did my friends but I heard that the 205 Garmin was good and I have that now.  Very happy with that going on two years strong
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use it all the time.  This app has transferred for use as well on my Kindle as on my computer.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This story can be a little cheesy, in typical Nicholas Sparks fashion, but I find it very poignant that love is shown in its best form with young, passionate people, as well as between an older couple whose bodies betray their emotional connection.  Considering physical decline in the same thought as romance is a weird concept, but very interesting and sad.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|Great songs.  Great beats.  Bought it for my daughter but loved it myself.  Now have it on my phone to listen to whenever I want.

B002L3ARRU|5.0|This came out my sophomore year in High School and have been hooked since.  Cheesy, pun-filled joy.  Forgot how cute Mia Sara and Jennifer Grey were (teen boy crush on them).  Between this and 3'oclock High, can't go wrong.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|You will love this game...I promise!  But I rated it a 4 cuz the things are a lot of coins! Lol
0061726834|4.0|This is my first in a new series I'm trying out called \\"Retro Review\\" in which I review books that I've read in the past but never got around to fully reviewing. I thought it fitting to start out with Delirium as the last in the series, Requiem, is released tomorrow! I will first start off by saying that I originally read this in March 2011, about a month after it was first released and my initial feelings were thus: \\"I'm too sad to write a real review.\\" And I gave it 5 stars. If you notice it's been demoted to 4 stars in this review. I'll get to that later. This was the first book I read by Lauren Oliver and I fell in love. It was probably the first dystopian I had read since The Hunger Games and this was a few months before Divergent rocked our worlds so this was totally LIFE CHANGING at the time. It's still a fabulous book, but maybe not as fabulous as I thought it was when I was 22 and wasn't a book blogger, reading 80-100 books every year, etc etc. Things change.<br /><br />This book is still fabulous. I read about half of it on my phone with iBooks and I highlighted so many lines that I loved, that I can't include them all but it reminded me why I liked the book in the first place. Lauren Oliver is a bombass writer. Whatever you think of her characters and plots, she can turn a phrase like nobody's business. I was in a dystopian Portland, running with Lena and Hanna (the horror!) and working at Uncle William's Stop-n-Save in the afternoons. I saw what Lena saw, I felt Lena felt, I was Lena. Lena has spent her whole life living in the shadow of her family's sordid past - both her mother and cousin were consumed by amor deliria nervosa (also known as love to the rest of us.) She can't escape it and all she wants is to be cured so that she won't care so much anymore. Too bad fate has other plans.<br /><br />On the day of her evaluation, the lab in Portland is infested with cows (yes COWS) and all of the evaluations are deemed invalid. But she also gets a glimpse at a boy. He seemed happy the cows were there. He watched while they destroyed her evaluation. Afterwards, she can't get him out of her head. Thanks to her best friend's, Hana's, curiosity they end up back at the labs a few days later to investigate and who happens to be there but that boy she saw at her evaluation! His name is Alex and he changes her life. Much like any other dystopian, there are the outsiders (in this case the Invalids who live in The Wilds) and Alex indulges Lena's need to understand them better, to explore before her cure. In the end, he literally changes the way that Lena sees the entire world that she's grown up in. So her reaction is pretty standard...<br /><br />Of course Alex is a love interest and I do remember from originally reading in 2011 that I wasn't sold on him and I still wasn't in this reading. While Lena and Alex do have a connection, it seemed to be built on the fact that they both needed each other more than anything. I don't know how else to describe it. I totally appreciate Alex, but rereading this book now and knowing what comes in Pandemonium, I saw even more faults in him although, I have trouble putting words to them. He's no Prince Charming and, let's be real, that's what I want for all of my heroines (how anti-feminist of me, but whatever, I'm a romantic at heart.)<br /><br />So this book is great! It's a fabulous first in a series! It definitely got me hooked, but Oliver -- unlike so many authors -- absolutely hit it out of the park with the second in the series and this one just can't compare to it at all. I'm ready for Requiem though! I've been ignoring everyone's reviews so I can form my own opinions. I tend to like what I like and that's that. So I'm readyyyyyy.at a boy.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a wonderful epic novel.  Ken Follett writes a great story - his characters come alive and the history is done so well.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|I was excited to get this tool kit, as the reviews were quite impressive. Right away, I also was impressed with the packaging and how thoughtfully laid out the bits are in their own little sorting blocks; very cool! My issue came when I actually tried to use the driver and a bit for my Macbook Air. I got the outside cover open and switched bits for the inside and quite surprisingly, the swivel end came off while I was twisting it and several of the itsy-bitsy little bearings DUMPED INTO MY LAPTOP CHASSIS!!!!!!! I was not happy, and after a considerable amount of time, painstakingly looking for itsy-bitsy-teeny-tiny little balls of METAL with a magnifying glass, that SHOULDN'T BE INSIDE A LAPTOP, I think I found them all. I'm hoping that one of these little buggers doesn't end up shorting something out inside. I have to assume this isn't a common problem for this iFixit tool, but beware if your swivel cap pops off, in a precarious position over your vulnerable laptop guts, there are a bundle of little surprises underneath that can rain down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How, on God's green earth, is this book so popular?  It is truly awful.  If you want to read erotica, there must be better stuff than this out there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooooooo fun it's like your really being chased by the police<br />Knightsbridge grand then ending bending condemn. Entrenchment 5th  didn't end 5th  bdndnbdndhddhdnjrnrh hdnrjjrjjddjdjdhr

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg,this game is amazing. I bought this after seeing a recommendation on Facebook and I am sooo happy I did so as I am now completely addicted to it. I definitely recommend this game for 10-15 year olds who need a bit of fun in there life :)
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I sold my first item ever and used this app to track my auction.  It was really useful to me.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well worthwhile to watch. Enough action and suspense to keep you glued to it to know how it finishes. Being one who followed the hostage crisis for all 444 days, I never knew there were others who did get out ahead. Thriilling and very enjoyable movie!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but after I was and still pleased. Great idea. Our 5 yr old plays as well as myself constantly. We love my horse
B000FCKGPC|3.0|For me it would've been better to split the book the other way, half the story for all the characters.<br /><br />Now I dread reading next one and starting all the way back...
0062071017|4.0|This book is a good read and encourages you to think about strategy in the way in which it really is useful and practical. It is targeted at people who lead businesses and have decision making powers within their organization however, still a great read for anyone working in strategy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|loved it -  what a series!!!! this is the best thing to come along from across the water since doc martin!!
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Tells you things that you probably already know but reinforces them in practical ways. I would definitely recommend reading. Great find!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the songs in this CD, the artists and the variety of music.  So glad I purchased it.  Can't wait to see if there is a next one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is THE best bible app evar!!!!!! There should be an update for it but I can't find it. I think you should be able to find it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Apparently, there were no outstanding movies in 2012 because &#34;Argo&#34; isn't up there with &#34;The King's Speech,&#34; &#34;The Hurt Locker,&#34; or even &#34;Slumdog Millionaire,&#34; but it is a very solid and well-done movie. It gets an extra star for being based on fact.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Very good movie about the priest who defiled the Nazi commander during WWII.  And how compassion of the priest for  the Nazi commander.
0062124293|5.0|I thought this would be an essay about why Feminism is still important but Caitlin Moran one-ups our expectations by actually showing us! This book makes the tenets of feminism relate-able and hilarious. My favorite quote so far is<br />\\"Six weeks into being poleaxed by a newborn colicky baby and I would have happily shot the world's last panda in the face if it made the baby cry for 60 seconds less\\"<br /><br />I havn't laughed so hard reading a book in a long time!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it is great the graphics are great why did you change to Rio? And I also am confused why do you need to pay so much coins for people that is crazay

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a great book.  I enjoyed the story even thought at times it was difficult and sad.  I enjoyed the writing and the book.  I will definately read this author again!
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|sometimes I cant move fast enough to keep up with it, but its a fun game. great for children and all alike
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It's beautifully written, and a meaningful story.  It's current, painful at times, but well worth it.  It would be a shame not to read this wonderful book.  You'd be cheating yourself out of a memorable experience.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|this show is so addicting with so many turns and twists, cant wait for the next season to come out so I can get it on DVD
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very awesome and addictive! the advertisements pop up every once in a while, but the game is still great!

B007C7UZIG|5.0|I love this app!  It lets you shop and catch those great deals even when you're at work away from your Steam PC!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this  app, it is almost like playing Mario. I love the old schoolish feel of it and my kids beg me to stop playing so they can get a chance to play too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the only reason I rated this 4 stars is because I LOVE temple run and this version is WAY better then the old one.<br />pro- better graphics<br /><br />con-It always takes me to my home screen before I can play
B002T921AC|5.0|I bought this Cd along with several more CD's and tote for my daughter birthday, The product is in perfect condition and will be a highlight of my daughter's special day. Thank you !!
B00849F82E|5.0|Having heard this work quoted multiple times by Ravi Zacharias, a man I very much respect, I expected it to be great. I was certainly not disappointed. Chesterton is a tremendous author and a joy to read.
B007P3Q95K|5.0|Oh, why the bloody hell can't this sumptuously-filmed series of Shakespeare history plays be issued in a US-compatible DVD format? There are plenty of Shakespeare lovers over here in the erstwhile colonies.<br /><br />I've been reduced to watching scenes and snippets on Youtube, and in the highly enjoyable \\"Shakespeare Uncovered\\" series that aired on PBS earlier this year.<br /><br />Yes, the productions are elegant and magnificently detailed, but the acting (what I've seen, in the snippets) is truly formidable. Jeremy Irons, always a pleasure to watch and listen to with his dark, gravelly voice and intense delivery, offers up a smoldering Henry IV, brooding king and dissatisfied papa to the party-loving Prince Hal. Simon Russell Beale is well cast as Falstaff, and Tom Hiddleston makes a fine transition from the roistering young Hal to a dynamic Henry V. Perhaps the most riveting performance, however, is delivered by Ben Whishaw as the psychologically complex and politically inept Richard II. With his fragile frame, delicate tenor voice, and ability to transform himself from an ethereal, self-absorbed, arrogant brat, completely convinced of the divine right of kings, to the quietly introspective prisoner of the final scene, he is masterful. Rory Kinnear is excellent as Bolingbroke, Patrick Stewart is a moving John of Gaunt, and the direction (in this case, by Rupert Goold) is quite interesting.<br /><br />So will somebody at BBC Two please, please see to it that this series of plays can be viewed outside of the UK, on discs whose format is compatible with our DVD players?
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Don't really need to say anything else. Love the album. Well written, thought provoking lyrics and beautiful/unique voice. I was not familiar with her previously, but this album made me a fan.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Movie was ok.  We really expected more from the academy award winner for best picture.  It was rather slow until the last 1/2 hr or so.  Of course John Goodman adds a great deal to any movie.
B004SDEP38|1.0|The free app only lets you view. You can't edit or input data at all. My five year old PDA does better than that.  Useless. Deleted.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel did an admirable job with this movie.  It did not lack for interest and kept your attention.  Woulod recommend this movie.
0062073192|3.0|I love SN and was very curious about this book. Its not that its horrible but its a very easy read and has a lot of spells in what im assuming is Latin,  which I dont speak! So I find myself skipping a lot of pages :( a bit of a disappointment!
0393089134|3.0|&#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; by Anthony Burgess is a very unique novel, one that is totally unlike any other that I've read.  What makes the book so different is the language that is used in it.  The narrator, Alex, speaks in a slang called &#34;nadsat&#34; (Russian for &#34;-teen&#34;) and many of the words he uses are Russian. For example, here's the first sentence of the fourth chapter:<br /><br />&#34;The next morning I woke up at oh eight oh oh hours, my brothers, and as I still felt shagged and fagged and fashed and bashed and my glazzies were stuck together real horrorshow with sleepglue, I thought I would not go to school&#34;. Note that glazzies are eyes and horrorshow is good.<br /><br />Burgess's invented slang is difficult to understand.  If you understand some Russian, the words will be immediately obvious (I estimate that 90% of the slang words are really just Russian); otherwise, reading this book will be a challenge.  Whether or not that's a benefit depends on the reader.<br /><br />There are two main drawbacks to this book.  The first is the extremely brutal content of the first seven chapters.  Alex and his friends commit every kind of violent act and the book describes it in full detail (albeit in the nadsat slang).  I have never seen the movie, but I cannot imagine watching what these teenagers do; reading the book was already too gruesome.<br /><br />The next drawback in my opinion is the last seven chapters.  I don't like how the author concluded the book; I won't give away the ending, but I will say that I found it to be disappointing.<br /><br />The book is short, so it might be worth reading if you think it will interest you.  Reading the book wasn't a waste of time; it was thoughtful and gave me much to ponder, but I won't say it is a great novel.  Certainly many others enjoyed &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34;, but I found faults enough to justify giving the book three out of five stars.
1608871452|5.0|Love love love this book! Def. for hardcore SN fans ;) you will not be disappointed! Disregard any negative reviews bc this bok is amazing!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Got these for my husband who is a big fan of the show. Good to have these around as part of our CD collection now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first two books, I cannot wait to start the last one in the trilogy, Mockingjay.  I really enjoyed the first two!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I loved reading comic books as a child and teen. So the adaptations to the movie screen of the comics has been greatly enjoyed by me. If comic book heroes and villians are not your cup of tea you may find this movie dull.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Ugh.  That's all I thought pretty much through the entire book.  The characters had little or no redeeming qualities until the end, possibly.  Would I recommend it?  You want to read something icky?
B009BJATYS|3.0|love jane austen books and some movies. this just didn't have the character developement needed to draw you in too the story
B009K0P10K|5.0|Fantastic! Twisting plots that will keep you glued to your seat. You will find that as each episode ends, you can't wait to watch the next!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|the best of the recent splurge of rewritten fairy tales that Hollywood has released to the veiwing public. Focus on different characters and different characteristics than the written stories.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|Somehow I managed to read this one cover to cover, but only through a monumental effort. I found this book to be the driest I have ever read, and that includes Great Expectations, War of the Worlds, and Moby Dick. The only reason I forced myself to get through it was because I felt that in order to properly critique modern versions of vampires, I needed to know the appearance and abilities of the original.<br /><br />Dracula is undoubtably a beautiful example of the period's writing, but when it comes to horror, the story falls flat.
B007Y612KA|4.0|Liked the 1940's and 50's look and feel to the film and the banter between the 2 main characters and the retro future feel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game and have no complaints since the last update. Just sometimes the friends list don't load for a while.
157421327X|5.0|I don't understand the reviewers here who are slamming this book, saying doodling comes naturally so why buy a $9 book and making fun of certified instructors and saying it has too few pages. I work with adolescents and adults in emotional and cognitive crisis. There are many people who are totally freaked out at the idea of \\"drawing\\" anything. Let alone sitting down and meditating. Zentangles gives ease, structure, optimism and an open road to a wide horizon. And for heaven's sake, let's remember not everyone has a computer. I have five of them, though and I'd still rather look at a book to get ideas.<br />I took some zentangle books to my 11 yr old niece and she flipped out, even though she was already artistic. Showed them to her teacher who showed the whole class a You Tube video about them.<br />They really do illuminate what it means to take one step at a time. They build confidence and calm. But starting out....it should really be simple. Which is why I'm buying another one of these ( gave the first one away), to show my patients. Nothing is worse than feeling something is too complicated and that you're too dumb to understand it. Nothing is better than mastering something you think is impossible.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Was pretty good until the end. It was like she was in a hurry to finish it. Will share this with my friends though.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I watched the film and found it very enjoyable.  Jane Austen is always a good read.  So much for that.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a awesome book<br /><br />I really enjoyed it and I am glad I read the book and it was free
B00004TLN3|5.0|Jane Austen books are always fun to watch, and this one was a good one like all the others.  Great!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so much fun. It is unlike any of the other games I have played before. It is so fun to breed the dragons and see what new Dragon you might come up with. This is so worth the down load.
B002OTO38K|5.0|But also not over-the-top Hollywood.  Felt very real and true to life.  I enjoyed this movie tremendously.  Thumbs up!  Way up.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I have read this book before but I knew then I didn't get out of it as much as it offered.  Reading it again, based on current experiences, changes the message and my understanding of it.  I recently saw him on the Oprah Network and his presentation matched with my previous experience let me know I needed to read it again.  When the student is ready, the teacher appears.  Don Miguel Ruiz is a good teacher.
B005LAII12|2.0|I wanted to like it, but man, it really was not good.  I like Mila Kunis, but still couldn't like this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love to continue along the story. My schedule made it hard to catch the airings on our local station and I had to keep fending of people in the office from wanting to discuss. I finally gave in an bought them. I figure it's less than the price of a movie.
B000089RV6|5.0|This is another great album from AC DC. Downloaded it to my iTunes library and it worked very well. Everything came in good working order..
B000MQRE4C|5.0|A bit slow for some, it is Thackery, but I really enjoyed it. Wonderful cinematography. I will always remember the candle scene and the ending.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Nice album. AC/DC never changes, they are great. Downloaded this to my iTunes library and went on, and it worked well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love, love this site. It has given me ideas on things I never thought possible. I would recommend this site to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All three seasons are wonderful. The story itself, the costumes, the actors, the abbey itself make for such enjoyable watching.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This album is the second album that I will treasure the rest of life. The first one is Amore. This album is outstanding!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's really fun and has more updates. Let's hope u can us rail cart or mine cars on the next update
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is outstanding!!!!!! It tells you exactly how much time you have left on your battery!!!!!! Love, love, love it!!!!!!!!
B0035YTG30|5.0|A timeless classic, Audrey Hepburn is adorable and charming, and Gregory Peck does a fantastic job. If you love the Classics it is a must watch.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Such a touching story!!I Absolutely loved this book,I rate it five stars!!!I think Buck is so loyal to John Thornton
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a really great show with interesting characters, that make you care as human beings set against the constant threat of death due to the Walkers. The sound is excellent, photography too, it just draws the viewer in. Andrew Lincoln is so believable as an actor, he deserves an award. I'm not one to watch a series, but this one has hooked me in. It is so unpredictable and isn't that what we all want and need after so many predictable Hollywood productions?
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was surprised that all the action was compressed into just two days. Made for a hard-to-pause thriller, good character acting on the Hollywood end.  Argo really brought back the historical context in a detailed thoughtful way, and pointed out that not all heroes get heralded.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I really, really appreciate that the footage in this movie is incorporated where it should be, and not something added on that you watch at the end. Yes, it's just eight minutes, but it was a spectacular eight minutes! The footage added bits and pieces here and there that really added to the movie, in my opinion.<br /><br />Is it worth $14.99, when you still need to buy Part 2 as well? (Come on, you know you have to!) I'd say no. I purchased the two disc set from Walmart and in-store, it was only $19.99, which is what I expected to pay for Part 2. It doesn't have the documentary, but I wanted the extra footage more than the \\"How it was made\\" stuff.<br /><br />I loved this and I appreciate the director for doing it, I don't care that it's late. :D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and design. I enjoy the game even being 40+ lol wish some things didn't cost so many gems but there are plenty of options. Hope to see upgrades soon but NO complaints here.
0307887960|5.0|lost 5 lbs in the first week!  it gets a little tough on week 2 -  but if you can get on a schedule, it is a wonderful book
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I mean it! This book is such a good story, draws you in right away. Sad, happy, disturbing, loving and hateful.  Very good read.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|he is the best!  great arrangements, sound quality is excellent, enjoy completely!  i strongly suggest this to anyone who likes him
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I enjoyed the acting of all the actors. Denzel performed very well and so real.  I would recommend this movie to be seen by<br />anyone who pilots a plane.
B004G606K8|5.0|This book has been with me since ones  young, given to my by my father to read, and I fell in love with it the moment a Mr. Flint Fireforge warmed his bones on a boulder outside Solace. Since, I have read nothing comparable, and certainly nothing to outmatch this book, save the rest of it's series. The best chronicles of the Dragonlance collection, and this is the  powerful and irreplaceable beginning.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Casino Royale(2006) is a good James Bond film drected by Martin Campbell. It reboots the series and starts fresh with Daniel Craig as James Bond. The producers took Ian Fleming's 1952 novel Casino Royale and updated it to the post 9/11 era. There's no attempts to take over the world by bad guys. 007 has to stop enemy agent Le Chiffre from winning money at Casino Royale. There's no Q or Miss Moneypenny in the story. M and Felix Leiter do appear. Bond gets help from agents Mathis and Vesper Lynd. There is some fan service. Bond wins an Aston Martin DB5 in a card game and we hear Monty Norman's James Bond theme during the end credits. The film delivers parakour, gunplay, car chases, and explosions. The theme song by Chris Cornell is good. The music score by David Arnold is superb. Daniel Craig is good as a violent, sexy, macho, blonde haired, blue eyed version of James Bond. Craig acted in movies and TV shows such as Tomb Raider, Tales from the Crypt, A Kid in King Arthur's Court, and Layer Cake. Casino Royale is a great 007 movie!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A moving read about two teens living with cancer.  The author avoided what could have been a maudlin tale (as a cancer survivor, found it a pretty accurate account of feelings and fears).  The narrator is a particular delight - sharp tongued, observant and perceptive.
B0055OG2BC|2.0|Casino Royale(1967) is a fun, wild, time capsule. It's also a sloppy, incoherent, senseless movie held together by filler scenes. Charles K. Feldman had the filmmaking rights for Casino Royale in the 1960's. Instead of competing with Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, Feldman made a farce movie out of Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royale. Casino Royale is a party that celebrates the 007 James Bond mania of the time. The music by Burt Bacarach and Herb Alpert and Tijuana Brass is an underrated classic. This film has a lot of star power, sex appeal, action scenes and high production values. A young David Prowse(Star Wars) played a Frankenstein monster who shows James Bond how to escape from an underground lair! Parts of Ian Fleming's book are in the movie. There's a card game at Casino Royale and Le Chiffre gets killed by SMERSH agents. This film is as mature and realistic as a Get Smart episode! David Niven, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Dalia Lavi and Peter Sellers play James Bond in the film! Barbara Bouchet is quite good as Miss Moneypenny. Someone who wrote a James Bond library book in 1984 claims this film is \\"sloppy and should not be considered a real James Bond movie\\". Casino Royale is a train wreck that works only as camp.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A compelling read that echoes The Bad Seed.  Kind of answers the question of what it might be like if your child were charged with murder.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I think this is so cool.  I can watch YouTube all the time now.  I am so happy that I have it on my Kindle Fire.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Great performance by Anthony Hopkins. He was unrecognizable. Interesting back story on the making of Psycho. I didn't feel the film revealed much about who Hitchcock really was. There was too much surface scratching & at the end I thought...that's it? Overall, a decent rental that keeps your attention. You won't want your money back or want to throw things at the screen. :)
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Fun with physics! A nice game that takes some getting used to. The music is really pleasant too. Try it if you're looking for something a little different.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was a very good movie. Not too many guns and explosions but, it did not disappoint. I was looking for more drama at the end.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love playing this game.  My husband even loves playing this game too.  They play it all the time.
0307742539|2.0|Would not have bought this if I had realized the writer isn't really of my taste. Will probably give to my local library.
B00ADYYY50|2.0|To put it simply, it's repetitive and boring.  We know you have money and you like weed Wiz.  How about something different?
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I will probably love any movie with Meryl Streep in it so I am very biased. The couple is good, I am not a fan of the male actor choice (his acting is good, it's just that I can't imagine him with a lady like Meryl Streep casting-wise).<br />Otherwise a very nice movie, not too deep, not too shallow. Just right :).
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Now I can't live without it!  My husband bought me Guild Wars 2 for Valentine's Day this year.  I have a regular keyboard that is perfect for...typing...and that's about it.  We play at night and I'd be trying to push keys and I couldn't see them.  It's not like the layout of my keyboard at work (which I use way more and can use by feel) and I was having a lot of issues.  I decided to try to find a back lit keyboard.<br /><br />After looking at many gaming keyboards and reading so many reviews, I came to this.  My first thought was, &#34;Am I that big of a geek?&#34; immediately followed by, &#34;My husband bought me a game for Valentine's day...yeah, I'm a geek.&#34;  I asked his opinion of it and he sent me a forum about different players key bindings.  I was sold.  I had it shipped one day so I could use it for weekend gaming.<br /><br />After about a week, I can't even play on the regular keyboard anymore!  I love having all my abilities and interfaces reachable with one hand.  I use the joystick as my F keys (my hands are too small to reach the joystick and keys at the same time for fighting.)<br /><br />I had one initial problem with it: I replaced my keyboard with this (both plugged in, keyboard just set off to the side) and realized 1) I couldn't look up items at the Trading Post and 2) I couldn't talk to anyone.  My fix was to leave the gamepad on my tower (raised with a pile of books) and leave my keyboard on the tray with my mouse.<br /><br />Definitely a fun tool for gaming!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Interesting movie from a historical point of view.I liked that it is fully based on a true story.<br />The sound in our version was not good though.
1608871045|4.0|Great book for any fan of the Nolan Trilogy! I've always wanted a book like this where you can take objects out and this one is perfect for me. My only issue is that some f the pockets are very thin and tear easy, I was taking out my joker cards and got a slight tear. Other than that very happy with the book all together!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Entertaining drama with interesting history, beautiful sets and costumes, and totally engaging characters. Great acting. I'm hooked. I love the convenience of streaming it with Amazon Prime.
B0026YWQ4Q|5.0|purchased this as a VOD or Instant acces movie via Amazon cloud; my kids love the movie as so convenient
B009FZFONO|5.0|cant get enough of it.<br /><br />The Story of Bob the Hitchhiker<br /><br />Bob had just gotten back to New York from a six year tour of doing volunteer work in Africa, helping to build houses, natural power & irrigation systems for the poor residents of shanty towns in impoverished regions - technologies that he knew like the back of his hand - when terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center in a suicide attack. Unfazed by the epic disaster, Bob rushed into action and used his paramedic training to help save the lives of over a dozen innocent people during the ensuing chaos and the aftermath thereof.<br /><br />After spending some time in contemplation, Bob decided to move to Georgia and go back to graduate school, adding PhDs in neuroscience & biochemistry to his list of achievements and soon after got a job at a local research firm before the outbreak. He spent most of his free time running a no-kill animal shelter, helping neighborhood kids with their homework and starting a neighborhood watch program to help reduce crime in Atlanta.<br /><br />When the outbreak happened Bob was on vacation out at a local farm in the hills taking care of his sick mother and when she passed away he was faced with the gut-wrenching task of having to put down her reanimated corpse soon after - this would be Bob's first encounter with the Dead, but not his last.<br /><br />Returning to his former home he managed to evade the Dead and eventually work his way back to his old office, where he labored away over the problem of the outbreak in the laboratory there for months on end. Then one day he had a spark of insight, ran to his equipment and did a test. It worked. The parasite died. He had done it - he had found THE CURE!<br /><br />But how would he get it to the right people to use it? He needed a larger supply of chemicals and a way to get them into the water supply. Eventually, after weeks of scavenging, he had finally formulated a concentrated supply of this miracle vaccine andnow needed only deliver it to the water treatment plant outside the city. So he grabbed his gear and set out to save the world once more.<br /><br />Along the way, he saw a car speeding by with a scruffy man, a dreadlocked woman and a kid in a hat inside. He tried to flag them down, get their attention, on the hopes that they could explain his plan and persuade them to drive him to the treatment plant in relative safety.<br /><br />But they just sped past and left him behind. Not willing to give up on humanity so easily, he eventually caught up with them a second time, but again they simply drove off without him. Saddened, he kept persisting on foot towards his destination and the salvation of humanity... until the Dead caught up with him, killed him and ate his corpse.<br /><br />Eventually his backpack would be found and a scruffy man would find a mysterious jar of liquid. He would open it, say \\"This water smells funny\\" and dump it all out along the side of the road.<br /><br />Wow just wow
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I don't care how often I watch this movie, it makes me laugh.  The characters are wonderful and engaging.  Aardman has come up with another winner. i am a fan of the  old pirate, swashbuckling movies of the past and this fits right in, tongue in cheek humor and lots of action with a typical Aardman sense of fun.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|What can I say - I truly enjoyed this trilogy, but....<br /><br />The best way to describe how I feel about these books is relating it to how I felt about the Matrix movies - the first one was amazing, truly a new concept and everything kept you guessing - after the first book/movie however it's hard to plod forward because it is hard to compare with the initial shocks and adrenaline - I honestly had to struggle through books two and three. I will eventually read the prequel, but I'm not as anxious as I often am after finishing a book, I will probably read a few other books first.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|First several chapters fly by at an exciting pace but eventually hits a wall.  The ending is more absurd than shocking and is pretty obvious several chapters before the 'surprise' hits.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Funny from start to finish. I laughed the entire time and just loved Sheldon's need to &#34;knock&#34; on Penny's door.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|There is no question, if you are a fan of Josh Groban, you will love this new album! Don't even think twice about it, buy it!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show sucks you right in from the get go and just keeps getting better and better. Kevin Sausage rules!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Katie (Erin) has such strength and courage. She grows stronger throughout the story. Katie really wants the safety and warmth of a home, complete with a husband and children. She is just afraid to dream a dream she can’t see coming true. In comes Alex. He is smart, witty, and strong. He sees more than most people are aware of when looking and a friend. Alex has baggage of his own, and yet he is good with his life and dealing with his reality. Their growing relationship and their connection to each other is wonderfully fulfilling.<br /><br />Kevin is not someone that I would seek out to be friends with. Kevin has serious mental health issues; the alcohol only increases his need to control. When he first mentions a bible verse, I thought to myself, this isn’t going to be pretty. He really thinks that he is everything and a slice of cheese.<br /><br />My favorite character was Jo, totally loved her. The whole of her, her opinions, leading questions and the truth, she is great. I would like to think that if I were in her position I could be as graceful, loving and have such strong character.<br /><br />As with all of Sparks books the strength of the characters and their realistic clove and compassion is so encompassing that it touches your soul.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Really has not caught my interest, start to play but just doesn't captivate me that much.  Considering removing it from my Kindle
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As I have enjoyed watching this program on PBS, I wanted to continue the collection I have at home by adding Season 3.  Absolutely wonderful!!!
B0086700CM|3.0|Really has not caught my interest, start to play but just doesn't captivate me that much.  Considering removing it from my Kindle
B0096BIENY|4.0|Good morning, it would be great to have access to the car to be rip version Il Divo, I have also obtained with the other cd's purchased. Thanks and keep up the quality as always
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lovely game. It's quite addictive :) A joy to play, the challenges are fun. Simple enough to not be stressful to play yet challenging enough to be fun.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Can't wait till new prod. start.Can't wait till new prod. start.Can't wait till new prod. start.!!!! !!! !!! !!!  !!!!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I just love the color of this item.  It fits my Kindle just perfect.  I would recommend this product!  I am thinking of purchasing one for my granddaughter's kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is great, you won't want to leave your seat, but have some Kleenex handy. Loved Shirley MacLaine's cameo!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Bought this for myself, but my sister fell in love with the CD, so now she's enjoying the music, just lover her!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was fooled by all the twist and turns and like all great performances, the end left me wanting more.
0792842243|5.0|I love this movie, it's been one of my favorites for many years. I cannot imagine how many times I've watched this movie and saw my own life unfolding.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a good game.  Lots of fun and my kids love it.  I don't like how quickly u can get to the internet with it.  Had to ramp up the parental controls.  All and all it is a good game that is entertaining and can waste lots of time with
B004UPAN6W|1.0|This movie was amazing until the end. A sincere and solid performance by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and noteworthy of mention are appearances by Sabretooth and Gambit. But the ending absolutely ruined the movie, and one of Marvel's most beloved characters.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another very good novel by an author worth reading if for no other reason that he could use the money to remain in the realm of being an author of good books.  Isn't it grand to know there are such people who can relate well enough via the written word to show you a portion of their thoughts and concepts while make the journey a worthwhile experience?  That and they can do it without using run-on sentences.
B002361MLA|5.0|Don't read any good or bad reviews about this book. Just read the book and feel it. You will find very quickly whether it resonates or not. Any other discussion seems pointless to me.<br />In my case, it does resonate with great strength. But that's only my personal experience.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars because the words contained in this book explain exactly certain feelings and ideas I already had but had never confronted with other people.
B007UK83S4|3.0|I found this very interesting but a bit hard to read.  The music industry was  unique back in the days of the Who
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was skeptical when I downloaded it. I just wanted a book for my lunch break at work. But once I started reading it I couldn't stop. I caught myself laughin out loud and blushing. I could really relate to the characters. Definitely one of my favotires!
1603429999|5.0|Awsom!!!  This is a GREAT book, covering a huge range of Circular knitting topics, which helps you improve your projects from OK to OUTSTANDING.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|The movie starts off differently than the original. There are newly added scenes in the movie that were key points in the book without giving you SPOILERS. I would highly recommend buying this movie for the big Twi-Hard fans out there who have also read the books. It will definitely give you more appreciation of the movie.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|a funny, funny movie. Definitely a great movie to just veg out on and laugh your butt off to. Yak! Yak!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and Amazon was quick to give credit when I mistakenly ordered online when I should have ordered through my Tivo service.  Only downside was it took several hours to download the HD version of the movie and couldn't stream it because it didn't download fast enough to stay ahead of regular viewing (prob b/c of HD resolution)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven, is an amazing book and it was very hard to put it down! I would recommened to everyone who loves a good romance:)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|At first it took me a while to get into it, but half way through I couldn't put it down! It was so captivating and every little detail came together at the end. Favorite book by far
B003TRKQNW|5.0|Magnificently conducted and performed Masses and Requiems by one of the greatest composers of liturgical music of all time.  Beethoven and Brahms went to school on Cherubini.  Listen to the layers and layers of contrapuntal music.  Incredible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game it challenges me in many ways everyday when I wake up I play this game!!!!! I love subway surfers
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows available. I love to watch it every week. It is awesome!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love how you can take minecraft where ever you go.  Almost all the items from the computer were brought into pocket  edition.  Another thing is you should add a nether instead of nether reactor.  And enderman.  Have an awesome day!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It is good but to slow sometimes. There us one episode of intese action and then one or two of drama.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I Love The Weeknd Sooo Much!!! Amazon Did A Very Good Job With Delivering The Album!!! Anyone Who Would Like To Get This Album Should. Not From eBay, From Amazon Only!
0062101897|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book. Fantastic detail, amazing photos, wonderful tidbits of information for fans! I have one single complaint. Nearly all characters are reviewed. Nearly all sets and locations are reviewed. EXCEPT for The Three Broomsticks. It isn't mentioned. And I can't help but feel this must have been some kind of oversight. They mention literally every single other set (even the Prefect's Bathroom and other sets that you only see once). It's a small gripe, but a rather significant omission for a true fan.<br />Otherwise, it is stellar and I am extremely pleased with it. I would definitely recommend any Harry Potter fan to have this in their collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun to play kids can even play...I recommend to download. It's easy and makes you wanna play all the time.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Love the series!!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was one of the best James Bond movies I have ever seen. I am really looking forward to the next one.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Nice to watch during the holidays. A great story that should help you to live your life. Don't forget,  be nice to people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game to play and buy.It changes the places where tricky and her friends go.Right now they are in rome ,Europe.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I had never read this before!  So imagine my surprise at how very scary this really is!  I was totally immersed with Jonathan Harker and his experiences inside Dracula's castle.  There were pieces that were off-putting, like the old man Mina and Lucy speak with.  His speech was difficult to read and understand.  But otherwise, I very much enjoyed it.  And I'm also amazed at how none of the film versions really don't do the book justice.  Not that that's a shock to any other book that is made into a movie, but even Coppolla's  'Bram Stoker's Dracula' isn't a really true representation of this novel.  Such a shame.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Some great long lost material. It took over 40 years but this Detroit poet has finally been discovered outside of South Africa and is touring world wide. Only wish he'd had his own band back then and produced the songs himself - I think the sound would have been more raw and gone better with the lyrics.
B006LSZECO|3.0|No real biggie - am half-way through it and not sure I'll finish it. Characters are too wishy washy for me
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is well designed for cellphones and pads. A good pastime game however, it is a little bit addicting.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I bought a used one that said it was in 'like new' condition. There are ZERO scratches on this watch and it looks amazing. The size is perfect for my skinny wrists. It feels really high quality, like a $500-600 watch feels. It is a great addition to my collection, and I find myself wearing it more often than just dressy occasions. The band is gorgeous.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A book that gives you something to think about. Gives you the perspective of the abuser and the abused. Thought provoking.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an amazing show! I love the twists and turns. The story line is suspenful, and I really wish we didn't have to wait between episodes!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very addictive! Love the challenge and never quit until 3 stars are achieved!! Sharpens my mind--and relaxes me too? A good way to end a stressful day!!
B00821OX98|5.0|As a science fiction fan I really enjoyed Falling Skies and can't wait for season 3 to be offered by Amazon.com.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Almost torture waiting to see next episode.  Love the writing, especially letting time pass and just  a line or two tells you want has happened without going into details.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I do not like the way it fits the kindle, and it is very unhandy when holding the kindle to read.  the angle at which it sits when using it is not right
B009JZTOG8|5.0|When I saw that this show was about fairytales, I must admit I was skeptical but curious to see how well it would be done. I knew it had the potential to be really good but could also be really terrible. To my pleasant surprise it is amazing! The acting, the costuming, the plot twists and turns. I wouldn't recommend this if you tend to hate fantasy series but if you like them or if you loved Disney movies as a kiddo, then I highly recommend this series.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I loved the original story, and wanted to keep it in my collection.  I wasn't disapointed this is an action packed drama that continues well with the saga of the black ops secret team.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I ordered this book after Chris's death but it had been on my wish list for some time. After being privileged to attend his memorial service as part of the Patriot Guard Riders, I learned a lot about him. The book is a must read for anyone who wants to know what it's like to be a sniper, but even more so for anyone who wants to learn about the man, the myth, the legend, and the hero...Chris Kyle.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Was hesitant at first but when got cabin fever and went to see it on the big screen I knew I had to have it for my blu ray collection at home.  I think it is better than the original more up to date and expecially the computer graphics are better.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Quick and exciting read.  Makes you so proud to be an American and So grateful to our military.<br />Only one question, why didn't they have something to tie up the initial group they encountered ?<br />Might have prevented them from brining enforcements to kill our soldiers.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|This movie is largely disgusting for anyone who has any sensibilities about love, sex, and romance. The obvious story here is that it's not going to be possible to have a purely sexual relationship without any attached feelings, and we go into the story hoping for that redemptive lesson to come through. It finally does, but not until a lot of crude and lewd and nasty dialogue and visuals have taken place. And when the lesson is learned at the end, it's half-hearted.<br />Just makes me depressed about how people view sex and relationships. So casual. So selfish. And we wonder why our culture is riddled with divorce and so many of us suffer from feelings of isolation and low self-worth.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|The Zeppelin flies again! Hope they will tour again in the future! Zoso lives on! Bonzo is pleased with the show!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I was out walking one evening with a friend a we passed a dark area on the sidewalk. She pulled out her cell phone and clicked on a flashlight and voila! there was light so we didn't trip. I asked where she got that and she said it was a free app so when I got home I went looking for one for my phone. I found this one and it works great. I've used it when needing to read something in dark areas. Installed easily and gives enough light to read a menu or anything else. Will be useful also if I'm walking after dark.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The best movie ever!!! i like this series if you're fan you need to buy this epic movie, i really enjoy blue ray format...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Went to visit granddaughters and they wanted to teach me how to play Subway Surfers.  We had a ball.  I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire, theirs was on their mothers IPad.  Of course they won, but I wasn't doing to bad for an old lady
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|It was a really passionate. I loved it!  I really liked the actors and the lines were almost exactly like the book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Holt es euch einfach temple run 2 ist viel besser als sein vorgänger bessere Grafik bessere struktur coolere Charakter und bessere inzinierung !!! Plicht für jump\\"n\\"run liebhaber aber auch andere werden es lieben
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Truly enjoyed the book from beginning to end. I was able to feel every character in the book. What a sad place and time in history. The story being told by the angel of death/the grim reaper was so unique.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Diese spiel ist der hammer es wird nie langweilig weil es sehr viele Charakter zum freischalten besitzt und deswegen schier endlos ist! Ladet es euch runter probiert es aus ihr werdet es lieben allein schon wegen der ständig sich wechselnden städten und themen
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I've always been a fan of science fiction and I loved the X-files.  The entire Fringe series has held my interest and admiration since the first episode.  Don't get me wrong, there are times when it was a little hokey and a bit of a stretch but that's just part of the sci-fi experience.  This whole series is well worth your time.  Enjoy!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|most of the reviews state trouble downloading.  i would REALLY get this one, after the problems have been fixed ---and it remains FREE.
0684135051|5.0|As always, Mrs. Zimmerman's books are enlightening, I enjoy her inclusion of history mingled with the patterns.  It is like having a friend in the room knitting with you.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is about a boy who was different and he has to start a school and his not so sure if people will treat him like they do to everyone else<br />I would rate it a four star the one part I dis liked is when something sad happened close to the ending but other than that it was awesome
B002ZBT84G|5.0|If you love Gil, you must have this....his  last  words.  Gil I knew you from the very beginning and I have stuck with you to the bitter end.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|thanks for the game I wish it was a 2 or multiplayer game.The reason why I like it is because it is a awesome statrgy game who agrees
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm still playing this game after four days (approx. 3 hours each day) and I love it. The puzzles are harder than normal, but I love that in a game and the invesitgation wall is an inventive addition to the game. Sure, there are hidden objects and puzzles to solve, but your private dick character has to use your brain a little harder than most games of this type. I appreciate that. The hint system is there if you ever get stuck and it is quite good. You can also skip some of the puzzle if you can't solve them in a certain time, but I refuse to do so. I love a challenge!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read , but this is by far the best book or love story I've ever read ! I was so into I read this book in 3 days , literally . I've never read anything so good and addicting . I'm glad I read it . Nicholas , I'm ready for another !
0857897764|5.0|I didn't want it to be over.  I loved her company, her journey, and seeing the PCT through her eyes.  I'm so grateful she went and did and wrote.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|It is so beautiful,I like it very much.I think it is worth to buy it.<br />Maybe I will buy another Tissot.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This is a superb novel, one that captures much of what it feels like to be contemporary.  It is so unusual in its structure--random-seeming vignettes that ultimately work together--and wonderfully usual in its point of view and characters--Egan is a genius in creating credible, sympathetic individuals and relationships--that I don't want to spoil the experience.  Read it and go with the flow.  It is surely one of the best American novels of recent years.
0385536828|4.0|I liked the book but have liked his previous books more. I was a little disappointed. Perhaps I expect too much of McEwan, thinking all his books are going to be as engrossing as his hits. I should accept the fact that no author can hit a home run every time at bat.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Sexy men are a good enough reason to watch this movie; especially if you're single, bored on a Friday night and have a bottle of wine (or something better) to keep you company.  Matthew McConnaughey is outrageous, and Channing Tatum melts your heart.  There's an actual story there.  Money, sex, partying, and the consequences of this type of lifestyle.  As a dancer myself, it was really heartbreaking to see the male perspective.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This was a valentine's day present for my hubby. He was uber excited to receive the box set in blue ray. He would watch this every day if possible.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Sharp, witty and well written.<br /><br />This movie is great.  The performances, the directing.  Clever, situational humor and scandal.<br /><br />Fast-paced - its a must.
0062238868|5.0|Last night I finished American Sniper, Chris Kyle's autobio. By the end of the book I liked the man. He was not filled with braggadocio and even showed some human frailties. His straight forward descriptions of his kills in combat and his \\"pissing his pants\\", as well as his personal conflicts in his married life (which he worked to overcome and by the end of the book would seemed to have strengthened his marriage) allowed the reader to connect with a person who happened to be a great memeber of our armed services. He points out numerous times that all branches of the service are heroes. I salute him and all the others.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|These characters are always bawdy and fabulous.  My favorite part was seeing them in the opening credits, but once the movie gets underway, it loses its sparkle and its momentum, just dragging the whole time.<br /><br />I'd recommend stopping at the first movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was good but not for the faint of heart or for the young audience.  It was a true love story.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Kendrick's performance is snarky but redeeming.  Her love interest is wildly endearing and Rebel Wilson makes the entire movie worthwhile.  And besides, who doesn't like a Glee-like dose of performance?  If you're not sick of it anyway...(because of Glee, The Voice, American Idol, America's Got Talent...ugh).
B005EGXTEE|3.0|The hypothesis of these books intrigued me enough to overlook a couple of missing things that, had they been there, could have made them brilliant. Given our seeming obsession with Reality TV the idea of the world in the book is just a great notion and so the concept of these books make them kind of the Brave New World/1984 of our age. The Hunger Games books don't have the depth, so therefore the brilliance, of those just mentioned but they are still worth a read. A great idea and imagination behind them certainly.
B002JI94J4|5.0|for the Beatles fan. blu ray. cheap enough. hopefully something they haven't seen b4. no complaints. thanks for the disc
B002RHGYOA|5.0|All the books in this series are excellent. The main character is so unusual, definitely not the girl next door, but you understand why she is that way and it is wonderful to see her relationships develop throughout the series. These books are rather hard to put down once you start reading. I borrowed the first book from someone but then had to buy them so I had quick and easy Kindle access at all times!
B005D63ICI|5.0|Not only engrossing, as he is a good person kind of, no one likes or should like evil doers and we all want comeuppance.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|After watching the first 2 seasons, it is a must to keep it going.  Can't get enough.  Great series.  Love the historical information.
B008JFUMT2|5.0|Great Movie and alot of action if you like all the other Die Hard Movies you will really like this one.<br />i can't to buy it when it comes on DVD.
B007712XAU|5.0|I've heard about this series and it is incredible.  It catches your attention in the first scene and continues in all the other episodes.  I can't get enough.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B0000064TT|4.0|Discovered this via Ken Scott's biography (although I had been vaguely been aware of this band) and ordered it a few days later. It shows the outstanding talent of a young Steve Morse!  It was very much a product of that time. Probably much more rock then the  similar band that Mr. McLaughlin band had roaming the scene in these days it has a few gems that have nicely stood the test of time. Odyssey certainly is one of the best tracks and the lovely 'Little Kids' and 'Gina Lola Breakdown' are the type of fine music that is hard to find these days in rock.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love historical romances and this one is great. The depiction of the class system is beyond any other I've seen. The actors are superb!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Takes all the fairy tales and adds a new spinto the while tying them all together and its sooo addicting the episodes are over too quickly
0525478817|5.0|This book was a very enjoyable read.  It was so well written.  It is the best book I have read in a long time.  The summary seemed like it would be depressing but it wasn't at all.
B000T433CO|5.0|The only movie jack black is in that is watchable plus its a cute story line who wouldn't fall for some one with an english accent
B00BESM14U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I am a middle-aged adult. But I am open minded enough and have a teen daughter, so much of this resonated with me. This time in anyone's life is so strange, but through this, some of your best and most long lasting friends are made. Two thumbs WAY UP for this movie. Great soundtrack, too!
B000W4D94I|5.0|Shows the destruction of tornadoes and how much needs to be learned about them with a cute love story thrown in
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sweet innocence & great love story on friendship, trust & forgiveness. Lots of memorable&#34;firsts&#34;.<br />This made for a great lazy Saturday quick read.
B00377E5SG|5.0|If only real life where like this then every girl could go to paris and come home have a millionaire fall in love with them and live happily ever after
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story may have been told before but it was entertaining none the less. A few hours of easy reading.  Good entertainment.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Any movie with kevin kline is going to be a good one add meg ryan and u know its going to be a cute romantic comedy
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Nice way to introduce us to the alien in &#34;Alien&#34;. Noomi Rapace had a good role in this sci-fi story
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Who wouldn't want to see robert de niro dancing around in a dress after all those serious characters he has played plus its a great twist on what's basically a love story
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Banter between &#34;heroes&#34; = good time fun. Robert Downey Jr. was the one I liked the most. Samuel Jackson = good.
B0041B4H1M|5.0|Good for anyone who doesn't like horror movies but still likes a thrill and a good intense movie without to much gore
B005C5SJ1U|4.0|The horrors of war in a different light. Predictable in some ways. Actors did a great job staying in character.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I love this movie so much and will always charish this movie till the day I die its so perfect
B00BETX5PS|5.0|More entertaining than some. Liked it. Good story line. I like Mr. Craig. Like the song. I would have made this a contender for best movie.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite go together like peas and carrots.  Like an old fashioned blues jam with a guitar and a harp.<br />This album is a must for the blues enthusiast.  Highly recommend!
B004X75RK4|3.0|Marginal but good. Entertaining feel good movie. Creative girl meets boy and fall in love movie. Situation was creative. I felt I had seen this movie before with a different title and story line.
B005LAII0S|5.0|I love this movie! However, the case was pretty dinged up. Made me wonder if I'd received a previously viewed movie though the description said it was new. The disk itself looked new.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|For me too much Ben Affleck. Would not have made this my &#34;best movie&#34; pick. It's hard for me to believe this was the top movie of 2012. I would have had 4 others I liked much better.
0307474259|5.0|A great tactical day to day reference.<br /><br />Get control of your diet, weight, and consumption of wheat, sugar, and simple carbohydrates. Find out why you crave what you crave. See how processed food is completely engineered to incite you to eat more of the same nutritionally  void, high caloric content food product.<br /><br />Gary Taubes does a great job breaking the health details down into understandable, not overly ‘medical’ terminology. HE has done a great job lifting the veil off of the misinformation provide by the established medical system. Giving you the understanding and tools you need to take control.<br /><br />I highly recommend and thank Gary Taubes for this and his other great book- Good Calories, Bad Calories, and the controversial science of diet and health.<br /><br />Information is king, and here is a treasure trove of what you need.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|What a smart a** ufo pilot say&#34; Paul was over the top crazy. I liked the characters and the Galaxy Quest feel.
1400069807|5.0|Another excellent read. Some take a ways to think about.<br /><br />A: Why do the majority of retired Food executives interviewed<br />1: In retirement, why do they avoid the very products they were responsible for selling?<br />2: Why do they carry this 'not responsible' yet vocally remorseful 'wish they had been able to do more to change things' regret?<br /><br />B: Yet more proof that the USDA, FDA, and most other 'Public Health Associations' are completely ineffective at carry out their supposed public mission statement. I used to think it was a failure of management type of issue. The more I look into this, it seems to be more a matter of intentional systematic and organizational design. If that is true, then what does that really mean for the consumer?<br /><br />C: To the food industry, the American consumer is nothing more than a resource. There to extract out as much money as possible. To this effort, we must understand they have absolutely no regard for your personal health, nutritional needs, or well being. You are their goose that lays their golden egg, and they have no problem extracting all the wealth out of you they can. Up to and including the point that you expire, prematurely if needed.<br /><br />That's just the tip of the iceberg. Get educated America!
B002BI6SMI|3.0|let your daughter know you love her by beating the cra* out of others. After you told her what &#34;not&#34; to do.
1609611543|5.0|Great resource!<br /><br />If you’ve finally come to the point where you are really starting to believe the information being peddled by the FDA, USDA, AMA, Diabetes Associations, etc…, Then this is a great place to start re-educating yourself.<br /><br />Excellent details in the changes to the plant that we are feed that industry calls ‘Wheat’. And it’s impact on human biology.<br /><br />Get the straight facts on Insulin and its controlling of your fat use and storage, appetite,  and a host of other body processes. Start to see how the food industry is manipulating Wheat in our foods to entice you to crave and want more!<br /><br />Lastly, know that this is not rocket science. Don’t be afraid to look into and research ‘medical related information’. The established medical systems would rather you believe that you must rely on their information and judgments they make on your behalf.<br /><br />Knowledge is power, get it and make your own health decisions. Get educated America!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Action packed from the beginning to end. Well worth the read. I can't wait to read the next Jack Teacher book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Enjoyed seeing throughbacks of  the earlier Bonds, this might become one of my favorites.<br />Action was on par for any audience.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a well written, well acted story that is so compelling that it is difficult waiting to see the next chapter.  Everyone I know who has seen it recommends it highly and I do as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I won't spoil it for those who are considering ordering the series, but this was definitely the best/ worst season finale I've ever seen.  Best because of the fine acting and utter suprise, worse because I will miss one of the most important characters in the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't normally like this author but this book wow!!! Easy read you won't want to put it down. I'm sad it's over:(((
B004XZ99LO|3.0|Cirque du Soleil have more expectacular shows than this showed int his movie. I really do not ejoy it very much.
B00136NUG6|5.0|This album takes me back to back yard parties growing up. I make you move and miss how music once was. A must have.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I've bought different types of headphones, but to me this are the best for outdoor wear. My ears do not hurt when I wear them for a long time and I've purchase the expensive headphones that come with different size plugs but the do not seem to work well.My headphones stay on my ears, as oppose to the loose string headphones. The sound is pure quality. The one big problem is that one side of the headphone stops functioning if the string is pulled just a little, so they are very delicate. I wish Sony would do something to fix this problem.
B001QJUX24|5.0|I think The Searchers is one of the best western movies ever filmed.  The combination of director, actors, story and choice of landscape make it a great film.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|Saw the movie years ago and recently saw the Broadway production. I was utterly delighted when I discovered that Picnic was available on Amazon Video Stream. The picture and sound was clear.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|An apocalyptic adventure set in the not-too-distant future, this film beautifully portrays a dystopic, infertile world. Magnificently staged and exquisitely choreograped, it telegraps a palpable sense of fear. Though it has a gripping narrative it also asks as many questions as it answers, weaving in mystical and religious undertones that leave it to the viewer to find hope - or not - in the darkness.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed the story, very relatable, sincere and I liked the format. Characters were well developed despite the first person narrative
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Took my father to this movie.<br /><br />We both LOVE Alien. Kinda like Alien 2. Disappointed with 3, but didn't hate. Was intrigued with the 4th. Won't even dignify a response with 5 and 6.<br /><br />So we couldn't wait for our favorite director to do Prometheus - the beginning of the Alien series, we are told. Yeah!!!!<br /><br />I can never get the time I spent or money I spent on this dreadful piece of crap back. Great looking home ship and new world. Horrible story - was there a story? What was the story? Is there a story? What's the story. Did I miss the story. Story? What was this movie? Was it a movie or was it a boring dream. What?  This was my whole experience within the theater's 4 walls where I felt trapped while trying to discover if there was a story to this so-called movie. And it was long. I love good long movies. This was a bad long movie.<br /><br />So it's something about finding a planet because of pictures on cave walls on earth and they decide that it is the beginning of man kind. And then some rich guy - always some really rich guy - how lame. Easy. Come on. Anyway, so rich guy makes it possible to build a spaceship and send a crew to this planet and the crew goes into this structure where their is O2 and then they get sick and then someone turns into an alien like thing at the end - of course the rest of the crew turn into stuff too - like an experiment - everyone turns into artillery experiments - woe man, cool, did you see that guy turn into a creature for destruction?? And then the Alien creature thing that was a man but is now Alien and then years from now there are all sorts of Aliens on this other planet with eggs everywhere- Alien is born ..Wow, the whole beginning of the series, thank you for giving us this stupid explanation. And then 2 spaceship crash - woe, did you see that?? Two spaceships crashing - man, cool. Oh and did you see Charlene Theron doing push ups, man cool, woe. That's about it. Oh and some alien human huge giant guy has something to do with it all - you just can't figure it out - like he is all angry and mad and rageful and wants to maybe destroy earth, they think? Woe, did you see that huge giant alien guy, woe.<br /><br />Very toddler like writing. So is my writing - they match perfectly.
0385523394|5.0|I really, really liked this book. My oldest daughter went to jail just over a year ago for a 2-1/2 year sentence. I am from a family of 13 children and my husband & I have 5 adult children. No one in our family has ever been in jail, but this daughter got caught up into drugs and finally got caught after years of problems. I wanted to read the book to find out first-hand what it's really like in a women's prison. The author is amazing. She never blamed anyone but herself and told it like it was. EXCELLENT!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|so intense! My favorite show!! Not a show like it ever.  You cannot take your eyes off the TV.  Watch it, you will not be sorry.
1470056496|3.0|Yes, I know Jane Austen is a great writer -- I thoroughly enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, and cheer when writers like C. S. Lewis and Elizabeth Kantor wax poetic about what an insightful writer Jane is.  No, I don't have a problem with her moralisms, I'm an unrepentent moralist myself.<br /><br />And yes, flashes of that genius do appear in this book.  (And I did enjoy the movie.)<br /><br />But I'm sorry, I found this book tedious to listen to.<br /><br />First of all, the heroine is too mousy.  The slightest excersion taxes her endurance, which the &#34;good&#34; characters coddle beyond patience.  I'm tempted to tell her, &#34;Leave your corner room in your upper class mansion and try planting rice in the Guangxi fields for a few years.  Come back tanned, muscled, and beyond all danger of fainting at a mile walk through the woods.&#34;  Call it tough love.<br /><br />Second, wasn't Adam given some work to do in the Garden of Eden?  All these balls, petty dramas, endless conversations about nothing that real, give the term &#34;chick flick&#34; a bad name.  Sure there are some great observations about human foibles (which I may look up and underline some time), the characters are subtle and finely drawn -- but I don't find myself liking any of them very much, even the supposed heroes.<br /><br />You had me at Pride and Prejudice.  Now I think I'll fall back on Skyfall.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|My girl friend loved this!! She sings to it in the truck every time we go somewhere.  Received it fast!
B00422LESO|4.0|This was a quick and light read. Fun to get into the main character's role as a hopeless Austen girl.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Great movie. My girl friend said there was an additional song added the was not in the original. But I don't know.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is absolutely the best series ever made in my opinion.  Be sure to order the original U.K. version though so that nothing is cut out of the episodes to allot for the time slots in the U.S.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Great Movie!, Beautiful English Mansion and Gardens.  Great Actors!  Wish I had known about this movie years ago, but Im happy I know about it now. Overall Very Good Movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The series was amazing and I absolutely loved every book! I couldn't get enough and couldn't put it down! Wish there was more!
B009LHWEKW|5.0|The story of two bothers forced to walk the line between good and evil continues, and in the Supernatural tradition established in the first seven seasons, the story's twists and turns will always surprise and sometimes even downright shock you.  Of course the idea of an entire world having co-existed right here within or own since before time even began and well populated with monsters, demons, angels and ghosts is far-fetched, but the all-too human brother's suffering, triumphs and defeats will keep you coming back to find out who made it out whole.  You'll be shocked, you'll laugh, you may even cry, if you're some kinda wuss or something.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Although an interesting read, very poorly written. I wouldn't consider this book if you're interested in a detailed war narrative.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game. Fun to play. Great way to pass the time.<br />I can't put the game down.
B002E01LLG|4.0|Well-developed characters rescue some improbable situations making the whole movie more believable.  I enjoyed it and will watch it again!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Great price for the album. Ended up liking more songs than what I bought the album for. Buying the album is much better than just the songs.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Well, it was a great movie!  Was it the best Bond movie ever as some are claiming?  Does it have to be?  Can't it just be a great movie and leave it at that?  Nowhere near the number of cool gadgets normally associated with this series, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great price for this album. Spent less than buying just the songs I know. Ended up liking more songs on album. Good buy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the actual episodes so that is why I gave 5 stars but the image quality is poor and there are interruptions in service sometimes.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is the story of a girl, Layken, who has been transplanted to a new life and location due to the death of her father.  She and her little brother, Kel, have moved from Texas to Michigan with their mother.  Each in the family are going through adjustments and trying to find their way in a difficult situation.  There is a bright glimmer of hope when she means a neighbor, Will, that also has a little brother and it also dealing with the loss of his parents a couple of years ago.  Both are having to grow up faster than they normally would have and all of the emotions and logisitics that requires.<br /><br />The two hit it off as the story opens, only to learn that when Layken goes to school the first day she realizes that Will is one of her teachers. Needless to say, things have to change dramatically between them, due to many restrictions on the teacher and student appropriate interactions.  Even thought they are only a few years apart in age, its just not something that can be avoided.  But as we all know, the heart WANTS what the heart wants.<br /><br />This is a love story of perservance and dedication to the love one finds in the most unexpected place and no matter how hard they try to put it in a box and not let it affect their lives, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />I REALLY enjoyed the story and give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was the best drama I've ever watched.  I watched each season within 2 days.  I either loved or disliked the characters, which meant the parts played were done with expertise.  I am soo happy I purchased these 3 seasons.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of my favorite show on TV!  Seasons 1 and 2 are great, 3 lags in the middle but still worth watching.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey had such high ratings by family and friends; I had to buy the seasons.  Soo glad I did.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Great real world examples of how a little guts and a good idea can go a long way.  Essential reading for the recently unemployed and those who hope to be more fully employed.
B00170MYIS|5.0|I use this with my Sony DSC-HX10V camera as this is a direct replacement for the original supplied with the camera..OH and love the camera as the best GPS on any of my (3) such equiped cameras. Get more than 200+ shots per charge and 30+ minutes of video and still has more to offer. Bought some on &%#@ and claimed to be orginal...no way and got my money back through PayPal after I filled claim...buy the &#34;real thing&#34; and save yourself some hassles and have a great product..plus I prefer to buy only from Amazon and not from other vendors where fulfilled by Amazon...been a faithful customer for 6 years now and have never let me down...so highly recommend the battery as a direct replacement..but then it is a Sony...order one and you can not go wrong.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|An incredible tale of survival and resilience.  A book so insightful to the full spectrum of human nature that is should be on every school reading list.  A lesson in determination and self detachment, one that most would be unable to follow, this reader included.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|I am a bit different than many here. I like some of his songs, know who he is and love to read real stories. Sadly, at about 60% of the book (currently past 80%) I am reading now just to get it over with.<br /><br /> He didn't like his childhood (who did), he did a lot of drugs and I am exhausted with the waaaah, waaaah, waaaah, I'm a rock star stuff already. I am at the point now where you are literally reading his journal entries which strikes me as lazy. I like when guys like this also discuss their relationships with other rock stars but aside from his band and Nine Inch Nails you don't get much more.<br /><br />Instead you get a guy who is so insecure that he continues to come off as full of himself. You can spot the fan reviews here, they really stand out as biased. I don't think a non-fan would get it, nor care for it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app is perfect for my 4 year old son. It has made shopping a breeze and show up great on my android phone.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed out lout, chortled, and even snorted to myself reading this.  One of the funniest books I've read in quite some time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the BEST app ever! on my kindle,  it would stop,  but I had 2 un-install the game. Other than that,  Temple Run 2 is AWESOME!!!!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|Never read this author before & after this one I doubt I will try another.So slow moving & almost boring, it took me a very long, long time to read.
B00004RJ71|1.0|Anyone who likes this movie is special Ed.if your a man and like this movie then you probably wish you were sucking big Al's finger and hoping magic would rape you in the shower.worst movie ever made I would rather stare at the wall for two and half hours.movie sucks blows and chokes on all levels.i hate that I know this movie exists.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|On time and as ordered. I couldn't have asked for more! Apparently I have to write more in this textbox...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great on smaller pocket folders and kitchen knives.  Puts a razor edge on blades in just a couple of pulls through the ceramic V.  I have tried to use the carbide V but it seems like if a blade is far enough gone to have to use the carbide side I would rather use a traditional diamond whetstone.  I have not been able to get a good edge on really dull knives by using the carbide V.  I have used the swing-out sharpener for serrated knives, and it seems like the weak link.  It does work, but it is obviously just a piece of plastic with an abrasive coat and seems kind of flimsy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|If you like My Little Pony you will love this! It's just like every other app (The Hunger Games, Sims, exc) You put the ponies houses down and you have to earn coins and stuff for them and you have missions to advance.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I can judge it based on how quickly I read it.  Very fascinating and yet believeable.  For me, a book has to be something I can buy into, not too much of an imagination stretch, yet opens up new possibilities.  Like the island with the mere cats, although that was something unfamiliar, it was believeable.  Pi and the Tiger, so intriguing.  Read this book.  I know I am late to reading this book, I saw it for years and resisted, because of the unreal aspect, I was wrong & greatly rewarded in a great read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So well written. An excellent view of life in England at the turn of the last century. A soap opera for adults.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Much better than the last few Bond films. Nice mixture of contemporary Bond action to the nostalgic Bond. Very good cinematography.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book has so many unexpected twists and turns. So far, every book of the series has been wonderfully captivating. Can't wait to start the next book!
B00BOLQCB0|5.0|I LOVE this show. I haven't missed an episode and even watch them more than once. I have season 1 and allready have season 2 on preorder. I can't wait for Sunday nights to get here. Even though some of the charicters are bad, they have redeaming qualitys that make you care about them. My favorite story line is Rumple and Bell, but the Rumple-Riegna relationship is really good too. My 87-year old grandmother who recently passed away loved it too. She didn't watch much tv but was always out to watch at 8:00 no matter what. I really hope they have a long run, its about time they put something really good on that everyone can enjoy.
B00B5AP7NY|1.0|this from the the video game for PS3 XBOX360  YOU WATCH IT FREE on youtube look it up  JESUS IS LORD!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I was highly anticipating the last novel of this trilogy. The wait was well worth it and I spent a very long time savoring each line. I can only express my gratitude to both authors for for an exciting,adventurous,and thought provoking tale. I am,of course,waiting,with some patience,for the next. PENDERGAST FOREVER.<br /><br />A devoted reader.
1572704497|4.0|This suspenseful novel by Agatha Christie and read by Hugh Fraser arrived in good condition. I placed the like rating only because this particular novel is most suspensful for me and I wouldnt listen to it at night.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Scalzi's style is great. He paints a picture with words and has novel ideas for science fiction that show originallity.<br />I'm 76 and have always enjoyed science fiction, his use of old men and women adds a touch that should appeal to all seniors.
8866130915|5.0|Initially I was looking for a planner that was big, but after using this planner for a while I got used to the size (about the size of a female hand) and its worked well for me thus far.  It was a great price, there was nothing wrong with the manufacturing of this item, and it was well worth the money. I would but another one for 2014
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Such a revealing story and so sad that human beings treat each other this way.  She is a wonderfully strong survivor and I am so glad she has told her story.
B004EPZ070|5.0|It is a Cute movie and it is a great value. Worth the purchase and I would recommend it to anyone.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|leek and lightweight.  Just what I wanted.  I only wish it hap a spot to keep my stylus or a pen. Other than that it's perfect for me!
B000O77QD8|2.0|Having watched Letters From Iwo Jima a short time ago I was expecting the same level of great story telling, but was not able to compare Flags of Our Fathers with Letters.<br />For me, they got into the political arena and not enough about relationships with the troops.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig as James Bond is just great. (Though I read somewhere that he hates it) This movie is filled with a great cast though. Judy Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem, Naomie Harris, and my particular favorite Albert Finney! Javier Bardem does such a good job as antagonist and there are parts of this movie that, while trying not to spoil anything, will remind you a bit of Home Alone. There are some very awesome throwbacks that I think were added due to it being the 50 year anniversary and the new Q was finally introduced. Its for sure a must see. I would highly recommend purchasing it!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|nice tool for organization and sharing information. I enjoy being able to access list across multiple platforms. this is a must for all mobile users.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|One of the best releases in their long history. Theextra discs make it more special. I hope they tour soon.
0307279189|5.0|There is some discussion of the evolutionary history of running in humans; as a scientist I would have liked to hear a bit more. However, the discussion of the endurance game hunting was fascinating. The history of the Tarahumara tribe is amazing and definitely one of the most interesting stories I have read in a long while.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was fantastic. Puzzles were challenging but not impossible to solve. Good story line. Would highly recommend to anyone.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|When the musical travelled around the world, I was desperate to see it. Buying this DVD has made it possible to see the production on stage.<br /><br />Beautiful performances, great staging and props - look for lots of little tidbits like the TSE number plate... %)

B000BSNPRG|5.0|Wow! Where do I begin? There is so much material here in 2 discs. \\"Black Symphony\\" was the first DVD I owned of WT since I didn't have a multi-region player at the time. Disc 1 has the main concert at Java Island, Netherlands with 18 tracks performed running at 1 hr and 20 mins, give or take. An excellent concert performance by WT, all material on this DVD is in full screen but the main concert has the option of 5.1 surround sound. The Java Island concert is performed outside so you get to see the amazing atmosphere surrounded by water and ships passing by. The concert starts during the day where you see everything in view then slowly the night comes in during the show where you get the great show of the pyrotechnics. On the same disc is 2 mini performances at Finland and Belgium with 3 tracks performed on each. Then you get 3 videos from \\"The Silent Force\\" album (Stand My Ground, Angels, Memories). Disc 2 you get all the extra goodies of behind the scenes of concerts and on the road, radio and television interviews, fan interactions with meet and greets, and a whole lotta HOT Sharon Den Adel! This is a must have for any WT, gothic, and symphonic metal fan out there!

B00136NUG6|5.0|All my favorite songs in one album. You need this for your library. Definitely a &#34;Shining Star&#34; in my book!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|not very realistic development of Christian Grey or Anastasia Steele.  More like a twady romance novel.  very disappointing  not even good action
B000J670ZI|5.0|Screwball classic comedy about an absent minded anthropoligist, an dingy socialite, a dinosaur bone and a  leopard named baby. Black and white film with lots of slapstick fun!
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|SHOCKING....yes, it's shocking how this film has been overlooked...HITCHCOCK is a knockout and one of the best films of the year...stellar performances by Hopkins, Mirren, and the entire cast...fabulous production values...completely original and entertaining...<br />but, somehow the filmmakers dropped the ball in promoting this movie....hence, very few people saw it and it was overlooked during the awards season...and, now, they are only offering it as a Blue-ray/DVD combination....go figure...
B008SGMPVU|5.0|great carpenter's movie, nice packaging. The product arrives in excellent conditions. I recommend this movie for sci fi and carpenter fans.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Actually my grandson downloaded this and he seems to enjoy it. My grandson even loves my Kindle and to get these games free is awesome
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Upstairs drama with downstairs delight.  Addicting. Why not spend time with this group of folks that have just as much crazy in their families whether rich or poor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Another free  program and my grandson just loves this game and he is getting alot of friends to download the game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the Slate article about the book this afternoon, was intrigued, and eagerly bought a copy after reading through the sample. (For less than the cost of a burrito at my favorite lunch place? Sure, why not?) It's now after 3AM, and I've read the whole thing in a single sitting--I just could not put it down! An absolute page-turner, and I'm thrilled that there's a sequel/prequel ready and waiting for me on my Kindle.<br /><br />While I don't know that this will join the ranks of my all-time favorite novels, I highly enjoyed reading it and am happy to give it five stars. Congratulations to Mr. Howey on his runaway success! I think it's well deserved.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great app with access to many versions of the Bible. I like it because it has access to many foreign translations as well. It is easy to use and work with. I like the variety and flexibility of the reading plans. The only down side is that I cannot have off line access to my reading plans. I also have no way to download audio for the Bible versions with audio.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|keeps the kids busy on a rainy day.they love drawing and using all the colors. they just love it  they are from 4 to 7 years old, but an older person could have fun with it also.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great App. My daughter got me in to this and now we play together to see who can get the furthest.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|was a waste of my 99.cents not much fun at all won't buy anything likes this again, haven't even let the kids try it yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great App. My daughter got me in to this and now we play together to see who can get the furthest.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I enjoy reading VInce Flynn, but was a bit disappointed in this book. I'll still continue to read his books
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoyed playing this one. The puzzles weren't overly hard nor the hidden object puzzles to hard. Would recommend to family and friends.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love Ken Follet's novels and have read many of them. I'm looking forward to the last in this series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool you run from a cop and dog get the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Its just like temple run temple run2
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle shared an honest first hand account of his experiences with the War on Terror. It is not for the weak of heart. He is not trying to gain approval for his actions, simply share what he did, why he did it and what he went through to do it. It provides a great perspective on what our soldiers are going through, have gone through and are still dealing with as they come home.<br /><br />Chris Kyle's death marked a sad day and the loss of a great Solider and SEAL.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have trouble sleeping, I tried this and it was like someone knocked me out. I strongly recommend this, if you have a hard time sleeping like me.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Recommend buying the Blu-Ray set and getting it with the digital download+DVD copy. You can then exchange the digital download voucher for the Amazon Instant Video version. Amazon's video services have been impressing me more and more as time goes on. The streaming quality is great and I can watch Game of Thrones Season 2 uninterrupted and unaltered.
B008220DGE|4.0|What we have here is a failure to Process. The Master is a dense, brooding, immaculately produced (shot on jaw-dropping 70mm film--they do make it like they used to, only better!) and exquisitely acted pscyho-sexual drama/period piece that is 100% not for everyone. If you like literary works by people like Faulkner, Camus, or have a dirty penchant for Freud but don't know exactly where to aim it, this is your film. PTA doesn't spell things out, nor should he. The kind of movie goer who would find this movie endearing (and I use the word lightly, or at least in a way one wouldn't apply it to say, The Avengers), aren't the kind of folks who crave easy answers. Thankfully, the narrative structure is linear enough that you aren't going to be infuriated, only curious, when the credits roll. I have heard comparisons to Sofia Coppola which are facile and pretty much just plain wrong. Maybe her early work. But Somewhere, this ain't. The plot, as other reviewers have doubtlessly endumbaerated, is a pretty straightforward sex-obsessessed PTSD-stricken WWII soldier is absorbed into a Scientology-esque cult after running amok through post-war America kind of thing. Once in the cult, said soldier begins to become 'processed', ie brought into the fold in a dark and gradually psychologically unraveling sort of way that is supposed to break him down, condition him, pick him apart, but really, well...you'll see. All that you need to know is that the true crux symbolically lies between he who deems himself master over beast or boy and what that means for both parties. Hoffman is reliable as always, and Adams is, as usual, underused but stunning as the cruel but calculating wife waiting in the wings and perhaps pulling the strings for the big guy. It is Phoenix's show however, and God does he own every single scene as deplorable paint-thinner slurping, sand castle defiling Freddie Quell. That shambling simian walk and arms akimbo pose of reflection ought to have garnered him at leastan oscar nod. For shame. Anyhow you should be cautioned that there is a bit of aberrant sexuality afoot, nothing hellacious but just enough to make David Lynch wriggle in his chair. So it goes with Freudian territory. One ought to expect it. To the subconscious we go with tools beyond our ken. Let the processing begin.
B005HSL626|1.0|It wont open up, it keeps freezing, it used to work but not anymore so i will be uninstalling the app
B009YX02T8|5.0|Love this soundtrack along with the others!<br />It's very easy to listen to, and I find it relaxing.<br />Good music
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave  this book 5 star because it was a good book. I like  how Katniss saved her sister. She was a great helper.
