B006LSZECO|3.0|I just finished reading this book last night.  It starts off well and has a really great twist in the middle, but the ending is so disappointing.  I was like, \\"What?!  That's it?!  You're kidding me!\\"  This book kept me up way later than I should have been on work nights but I just couldn't put it down.  I told everyone who would listen how great this book was.  I was expecting a really fantastic ending since the author clearly has a knack for suspense.  As I got closer to the end of this book I really got excited trying to guess how the author would end this tragically clever story...and then I actually read the end and was so disappointed.  It felt like the author just wanted to be done with the book so she took the easy way out.  Very blah, and quite ridiculous if you ask me.  Overall, I would still recommend reading this book as it was very suspenseful but don't expect a big climax or twist at the end as I was because you will be disappointed.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Always when purchasing older movies transfered to blu-ray there is a chance it will not transfer well.<br />Mr Lucas did his homework well.<br />I watched the first flick the day the set arrived.It did not transfer as well as I had hoped,but it did look MUCH better than the original release.Sound is where the biggest stride was made.<br />It rocked the walls in my house...nice indeed.<br />Day two I watched Temple of Doom.The video was much better than Raiders..much more detail showed through.<br />Watching Last Crusade tonight..should be even better as it is a newer flick.<br />I am glad for this purchse...and would do it again

145162607X|5.0|I have to admit that I was hesitant to listen to this historical fiction novel after the last one totally missed the mark with me.  Not so with The Kingmaker's Daughter by Gregory!  I absolutely loved this novel and the narrator, Bianca Amato, gave me a vivid picture of our heroine Anne, by embracing her character in every way.<br /><br />The story opens with Anne and Isabel as young girls, clueless as to what their father has planned for their futures.  Their father, Richard Neville, is a politically powerful man, who decides the fate of the individual that will sit on the throne.  Not only has he put men on the throne, but he has been responsible for removing kings from the throne as well.<br /><br />As the girls get older they have the opportunity to visit the court of King Edward and Queen Elizabeth.  Anne is fascinated by the beauty of the Queen, admitting that she has never set eyes on anyone more beautiful.  When Anne and Isabel decline the Queen's offer to join her court as maids in waiting, the Queen develops an anger for these two girls that will continue for the the rest of their lives.<br /><br />When Isabel marries King Edward's brother, George, the Queen dislikes the girls even more, knowing that if anything were to happen to Edward, Isabel and George could take over the throne.  Isabel develops a fear towards the Queen when she convinces herself that both the Queen and the Queen's mother know how to practice witchcraft and they probably put a curse on both herself and Anne.  Anne tries to discount Isabel's claims, but eventually these thoughts will consume her also.<br /><br />After all the political struggles between several countries, Anne finds herself married to the King's younger brother, Richard, who she hoped to marry years before but the Queen would not allow it.  I cheered when Anne was finally going to have a bit of happiness in her life.  It doesn't take long after their marriage, for the Queen to self-destruct and lose her position on the throne, leaving Anne and Richard as the King and Queen of England.<br /><br />I didn't realize that this is the fourth novel in the series until after I had started it.  I did not feel lost in the novel because of this, but it does make me want to read the other books that precede this one.  This novel contains so much more than what I have listed above.  Anne and Isabel's sisterly relationship is compromised at one point, and it is a hard journey for them to find their way back to one another.  With themes of sisters, love, power, and loyalty this was an amazing novel to listen to and I highly recommend it!throne, leaving Anne and Richard as the King and Queen of England.<br /><br />I didn't realize that this is the fourth novel in the series until after I had started it.

The Iron Man movies were much better. I always did think Captain America was a screwy concept. Kind of like Batman fighting with Superman.

B0002TJGQS|3.0|Though the price was the lowest around and I thought to myself the shipping was high $7.95 for a $5.00 item I went ahead with the purchase assuming they must have to package these little batteries with some special packaging therefore the high shipping rate.  So I was a little upset when they arrived in a regular envelope via US MAIL with 45 cents worth of postage on it.  I think there shipping rates are used to pad there profit a bit.  Good batteries just expensive to get them to you.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|Yes, the game lacks instructions, but that's part of the fun... Figuring it out. Don't bother down loading this if you have no patience or don't understand logic games.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a good little sharpener. I've already given a couple away to friends when they see them, so I am always replacing one, as I am now. A few thoughts.... I like this PP1 for my smaller working knives, not my more expensive big knives. First of all, any blade over 7 inches kind be awkward to sharpen.<br /><br />The 45 degree angle is somewhat limiting, so be cautious of what type of blade grind you use in this sharpener. I think extended use with a convex, asymmetrical, or hollow grind will eventually turn them into 45 degree flat grinds. Flat ground blades are probably the best type to use the PP1 on in my opinion.<br /><br />The flip out diamond rod has been a blessing for the few blades I have with partial serrations. The only drawback is that it removes a lot of metal. Speaking of metal... I have a couple titanium bonded blades which are next to impossible to sharpen on the PP1.<br /><br />Overall, I think the PP1 is a great companion for a favorite everyday carry (EDC) knife, or only those select few which would be good with this sharpener. For my larger knives and finer knives I use a series of stones depending on the results I wish to achieve. Thanks for reading.<br /><br />SPO

B008C1O8CA|4.0|I wasn't aware that there was a new Green Day CD out until I saw it in a Target advertisement. Since I don't have a Target near by, I settled for the edited CD from Walmart. This new set of songs are slightly different than their last few releases and they are more pop-like with a few ballads thrown in. Overall, I enjoyed the Uno! as there are several catchy tunes such as Nuclear Family, Sweet 16, Kill the DJ, and Loss of Control.<br /><br />The songs on Uno! are:<br /><br />1. Nuclear Family<br />2. Stay the Night<br />3. Cape Diem<br />4. Let Yourself Go<br />5. Kill the DJ<br />6. Fell for You<br />7. Loss of Control<br />8. Troublemaker<br />9. Angel Blue<br />10.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I had not seen any clips nor heard any songs before buying this dvd, though I had read the original book on which the basic story was based ('The Phantom of Manhattan' by Frederick Forsyth).  So I really had no idea what to expect but I bought it because 1) I'm a POTO fan and 2) Andrew Lloyd Webber.<br /><br />In short - this is a tremendous show.  Buy it immediately.<br /><br />I disagree with those reviewers that say the music is nothing special.  I love the music (and have bought the cd).  Several songs in particular stand out: 'The Beauty Underneath' (a visual feast and a wonderful song sung by the Phantom and Christine's son, Gustav), 'Devil Take the Hindmost' (Raoul and a spectacularly sinister Phantom), and 'Love Never Dies' (Christine's signature song which always brings tears to my eyes).  Don't take me wrong - I don't think there's a bad song in the entire show, these are just my favorites.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I won't bore you.  Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind.
034580404X|1.0|The first book was very long and drawn out. The second one was okay and by the third book I was so bored that I could hardly finish it! Too many words were used over and over again.

Definitely not good enough to buy!
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|Venetia is one of Heyer's later works, originally published in 1958, and Heyer is clearly at the top of her game, writing well-developed characters in a mature and emotionally satisfying love story. Venetia Lanyon is \\"on the shelf without ever having been off,\\" as she puts it. At twenty-five, she's close to being an old maid, and without having enjoyed so much as one London season. The hero, the rakish Lord Damerel, is quite a bit older--thirty-eight--tall and athletic, but not especially handsome, his face lined from years of dissipation.<br /><br />Unlike many of Heyer's (and other author's) romances, which use the \\"hate at first sight\\" plot to create ongoing sexual tension through misunderstandings and verbal fights, only to be resolved on the last page, in Venetia the couple enjoy a genuine friendship almost from the start. After the obligatory forced kiss has been gotten out of the way, the two recognize in each other kindred spirits: intelligent, well-read people who get each other's jokes. For the first time in her life, Venetia has found someone besides her younger brother who isn't shocked or baffled by her tendency to speak honestly. What Venetia most treasures in her new-found friend is that he's someone she can laugh with.<br /><br />Another appealing aspect of the story is the heroine's independence. With both parents dead and her adult brother overseas in the aftermath of Napoleaon's defeat, Venetia has been running the household for years. At her \\"advanced\\" age and living in the country among a small group of families that all know each other, she enjoys an unusual degree of freedom. True, Venetia's situation is atypical for her time and place, but it makes the story more enjoyable for modern readers. Venetia may regret her lost London seasons and wish for a larger circle of acquaintance from which to choose a husband, but she does have choices, and she's not poor, either in money or in spirit.<br /><br />A recurring theme in Heyer's works is the uncomfortable fact of men's inability to adhere to strict, literal monogamy. Many of her novels show middle-aged couples in enduring, happy or at least comfortable marriages, in which the husband has been known to \\"stray\\" but remains emotionally faithful to his wife. Rarely is this idea applied so explicitly to the couple at the center of a romance novel, and it makes for a somewhat different kind of love story. The \\"ick factor\\" that the only one-star review here mentions is not quite as \\"icky\\" as the reviewer states, but it *is* there. If you read Heyer expecting twenty-first century gender equality you will be outraged or disappointed; if you read her romances for their unique mood, witty dialog and brilliant comedy, Venetia will provide all that plus something a little \\"off\\" that, to me and, I think, other sophisticated readers, gives what could be an overly sweet confection a much-welcome edge.<br /><br />Not wanting to spoil the story, I will say that the facts of women's as well as men's difficulties with monogamy are acknowledged without tears in Venetia. Heyer treats female \\"rakes\\" with refreshing sympathy and understanding. Her attitude seems to be that all sexy, intelligent men are potential rakes, while only some women are. The problem, of course, is that Venetia, as an intelligent, beautiful woman, requires a superior man for her husband, and he will therefore necessarily be a rake. Reformation is possible; changing human, masculine nature is not. Venetia, the heroine, resolves this problem with her usual honest, humorous acceptance.<br /><br />I recommend this book enthusiastically to all Heyer fans and potential fans, and especially to those readers who like a romance that makes you want to argue with the author and her characters, not in anger but with love. \\"Yes, but...\\" I want to say, and wish I could hear Heyer's answers, expressed through Damerel's and Venetia's words. Read it and create your own mental Q&A.mfortable fact of men's inability to adhere to strict, literal monogamy.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am just about done reading this but all I can say is when I got the first one I had to immediately get the second one and then the third. It is more than what people think. I usually don't read books this fast but within a month I am finishing these 3 books. I can take up to a year reading other books. It is also my first experience reading on a kindle which is very convenient. Not having to carry books around. The books are very detailed which I find erotic and the basic fact is that it is a story unfolding about reasons for whom this person became, which I can relate to. Not just a sex book, so if that's what you want, believe me, you'll get more than you bargained for as you will be starved for more information. Might as well buy all 3!!

B000006U44|5.0|One of the enduring mysteries of pop music remains Kate Bush's relative unpopularity in the USA compared with the rest of Europe and the world. It still confounds that her stunning 1978 debut \\"The Kick Inside\\" didn't catapult her high onto the American charts. Was she too poetic? Did lines such as \\"you crush the lily in my soul?\\" or songs based on literary classics scare away American radio programmers? Was it her voice? Her mature little girl timbre, especially early on, may have sounded shrill or too young to American listeners used to the more gravelly buff female voices of the late 1970s. Or was she simply too sophisticated? Bush's lyrics and lush arrangements may have confused American music marketers. How could they sell her as a sex symbol? A bimbo or fervently sexualized persona would not fit Bush's music. Though an early video for \\"The Man With The Child in His Eyes\\" does feature a 19-year old Bush writhing in a tight body suit. But even this comes off more as erotic art rather than merely titillating brazen sexuality, exemplified later by Madonna, Britney Spears and countless others ad nauseum. Whatever the reasons, the absence of Bush from American popular music definitely remains America's loss.<br /><br />With the release of \\"The Kick Inside\\" Bush became an instantaneous legend in the UK. The first single, \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" hit a chord that still hasn't stopped reverberating. Bush herself has apparently stated that she doesn't understand \\"all the fuss\\" about her since this album's appearance. But her first album just doesn't let up. It's overwhelming. Great song after great song keeps rolling past. Before one can fully appreciate the song that just ended, another equally great one typhoons right into consciousness. From the whale moans that open the album and \\"Moving\\" to the angular \\"Kite,\\" the absolutely, almost painfully beautiful (and potentially disturbing) \\"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\\", the rocking \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" followed up by the stripped down \\"Feel It,\\" which ultimately culminates in the stunning closing title track with the struggling final line \\"oh, by the time you read this,\\" this collection constantly surpasses expectations, especially for a first album by someone so young. It sounds more like a mid-career peak than a beginning.<br /><br />Of course, Bush didn't just crank these songs out in a few months. They represent the culmination of years of songwriting, which supposedly started at age 13. Receiving help early on from David Gilmour of Pink Floyd probably didn't hurt, either. This helps explain why the follow-up, \\"Lionheart,\\" pales somewhat in comparison. With the success of her first album, Bush's record label, likely slobbering for more, put a rush on the production of her second album. It appeared only eight months after \\"The Kick Inside.\\"<br /><br />Bush of course kept going. \\"The Kick Inside\\" didn't dry up the well. And she's still going. Most of the world considers her a music legend. And though she definitely has a following in the USA, her songs don't dominate radio waves like they probably have elsewhere. Was \\"Wuthering Heights\\" even played in the US in 1978? If it was it fizzled, steamrollered over by whatever music trend reigned at the time.

B008I34ZFW|4.0|The Nazis have been hiding on the dark side of the moon for more than seventy years, waiting for the chance to strike back. Because of this outlandish premise, \\"Iron Sky\\" may look to some like over-the-top, campy fun, something like \\"Mars Attacks!\\" For better or worse, the Finnish-German-Australian film is actually more than just a wacky one-joke comedy, taking itself pretty seriously, with the action-filled climax and blatant political commentary - perhaps too seriously.<br /><br />The story is almost non-existent. In the year 2018, an American astronaut James Washington (Christopher Kirby) is attacked by Nazi soldiers on the moon, and is held captive in the swastika-shaped Nazi basee, where the \\"Führer\\" Wolfgang Kortzfleisch (Udo Kier) rules. In his attempt to escape, Washington meets a schoolteacher and researcher Renate Richter (Julia Dietze), who is also fiancée to ambitious military officer Klaus Adler (Götz Otto).<br /><br />Like many low-budget B sci-fi movies, the story is a concoction of various ideas - slapstick, a love romance, an eccentric scienist, attack of space zeppelins and United States presidential election. Part sci-fi action and part political and social satire, the film has many parodies and references to other better-known films and pop culture, including an angry, ranting Hitler of \\"Downfall\\" and one Charles Chaplin classic (edited down for the kids). While some of them are clever and funny, some look dated, even at the time of the film's initial release, like Sarah Palin-like US President played by Stephanie Paul.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"Iron Sky\\" is too ambitious, trying to achieve something deep like a social drama, while entertaining us with spoof and action. The film may not be totally successful at that, but director Timo Vuorensola keeps the ball rolling, with effective acting from the cast and special effects that are surprisingly good.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I don't own it but its only a quarter so you mite as well get it I I'm not gonna get it sorry I'm not much help but its a good game ive played it on computer

B0085MNZ66|4.0|Posted:8:16 AM<br /><br />Game Play:<br /><br />You are given colored dots and you have to connect like colored dots. After 3 levels it explained that there is a back button to undo a move. After 4 games the bonus was unlocked. There are no instructions but the game play is to connect the dots with like colors of lines. If you need a color then you can cross two different colors of lines and create the color you need like red+yellow=orange.<br /><br />This game is really a real brain teaser as you not only have to worry about routing the lines but crossing the right colors to create the right colors to win. The controls are simple but the game play requires planning and strategy to achieve the desired results. On some levels you can over complicate the maze and make the task harder than it really is.<br /><br />The game is challenging and fun but so simple you get frustrated because you cannot easily do each level. As you progress through the levels you unlock new worlds. You are also allowed to skip levels by pressing the Kindle menu button and select games in the unlocked levels.<br /><br />Home screen:<br />* Sound off/on<br />* Play<br />* Bonus - a white and grey screen with seven squares and seven question marks in them.<br />* Credits<br />* Onelivesleft - takes you to their web sight<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />The app features complex game play in solving a maze with multiple things to consider with every line you add to it. The controls are simple and the app worked well on my Kindle Fire. It is a mental challenge and can be fun for a while but it gets tiring quickly.<br /><br />The game has one simple and unobtrusive single permission.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />The complete lack of any instructions is frustrating as there is no information on the differences between the large and small colored dots and some of them will not connect. You more or less have to learn the game by rote which is frustrating and if you knew the rules it might be simpler and more fun. I don't like doing things over and over to simply learn the rules. One page of instructions would have gone a long way to improving this game's impression on me.<br /><br />The lack of an easily accessible undo button and a reset button would help speed up the game. It also needs a hint button to help you through some of the more complex levels.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This is an OK puzzle game and I got into the second levels but on some mazes I could not figure out how to beat the level. The levels with multicolored balls and different sized balls get more complex. I will continue to try to beat more levels but as I have said, learning to play by rote is a tedious way to learn to master a simple game.<br /><br />The developers should add some instructions and perhaps a hint button to the game to make the game more interesting. It would have also been nice to add an undo button to the game pages instead of having to hit menu then backup multiple times to erase the lines.<br /><br />I gave the app 4 stars for an innovative concept and interesting game play. It still needs some work and improvements though.<br /><br />Size compressed is 3.7 MB and it uncompressed to 4.02 MB uncompressed.<br />Permissions - prevent Kindle from sleeping.ht be simpler and more fun.

B008RV5K5E|4.0|Warner Premiere and DC Comics have topped themselves with the Blu-ray / DVD release of \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1.\\" After the release of \\"Batman: Year One,\\" the only logical choice for the Caped Crusader's next solo animated feature was evident. It was time for Frank Miller's other beloved and critically acclaimed graphic novel to be adapted for the screen.<br /><br />Frank Miller's \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" not only had an effect on the entire comic book industry, it influenced director Tim Burton to make a serious film adaptation based on the super hero that turned into a multi-billion dollar franchise. Many fans and historians would say it is responsible for the popularity of comic book movies today.<br /><br />It's been ten years since Batman's last appearance in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne has retired the cape and cowl for a life of tedium and drinking. He meets occasionally with Commissioner Gordon for drinks and to talk about the state of the world. Gordon knows Wayne's secret and is one of his only confidants.<br /><br />Bruce begins having horrible nightmares about his parents' deaths and witnesses Gotham City digress even further into the depths of depravity at the hands of a new criminal syndicate calling themselves the Mutants. He's driven to suit up once again to take on the homicidal maniacs and show the citizens of Gotham City that they need not live in fear any longer.<br /><br />\\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1\\" is the best animated feature film DC and Warner Premiere have released. There's no other way of putting it. It feels epic and holds a cinematic flare that the other entries in the DC animated super hero movie franchise haven't accomplished. That's not to say they aren't good or worthy of praise. However, this takes the medium to a whole new level.<br /><br />The animation is top notch and, although it doesn't mimic Frank Millers artwork for the book, there's a certain respect towards the unique style of the illustrations reflected in the film. Batman is larger than life and as bulky as the Hulk, but isn't quite as \\"abstract\\" as Miller's interpretation of him in the graphic novel. This is as close to a perfect representation of the book as I can imagine.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there are a few spots where the plot jumps around a bit and gets a little hard to follow. They jump from one thing to the next so quickly with brief or no explanation. The viewer is left to just keep up and embrace the fast pacing once the movie gets rolling.<br /><br />Peter Weller does a wonderful job bringing an older and weary Bruce Wayne to life. When he hits the streets for the first time in ten years, you can hear the satisfaction in his voice at re-embracing his long-forgotten mission of ridding the streets of Gotham City of the filth and crime that overtakes it.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1\\" consists of quite a few treats for fans. There's a sneak peek of Part 2 and \\"Batman / Superman: Public Enemies.\\" Two featurettes are included entitled \\"Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story\\" and \\"Her Name is Carrie... Her Role is Robin.\\" There are also two bonus cartoons from \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" featured. A section of the \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" digital comic is found as well.<br /><br />\\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1\\" will be the animated feature all future entries into the DC franchise will be measured by. They've set the bar high with this one. With a spectacular looking and sounding high-definition movie experience and some satisfying special features, this is a recommended purchase for all super hero fans.ations reflected in the film.

B00785P2QC|5.0|get the game it not a easy game but very fun<br /><br />I loved it I think you will too<br />you cant give up if you think your stuck I thought I was but I just waited and then did good
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm sorry to see so many negative reviews; I gave 5 stars to help counter them.<br /><br />Mr. Childs is very subtle and lures you to sleep; i.e., skipping parts.  This is a very different Reacher.  Most of the action takes place in his head while in a car going through a vast flat landscape with no landmarks and straight roads.  Then the final, dramatic battle at the end, where Reacher takes his revenge.<br /><br />Like the journey in the book, Mr. Child leads the reader down one road then another as he drops clues and red herrings along the way.  (I never did find out about the helicopter; it was mentioned at least twice.)<br /><br />The end is the beginning.  Reacher is back where he started -- on his way to Virginia to find the woman dispatcher.  So this is not the end but the beginning of the next Reacher novel.<br /><br />I recommend this book, but you need to read every page or you will miss something.  And be patient.

B0090P98Z4|4.0|Really enjoy the game. All the Diablo fans should enjoy this game. However I do wish there were different classes.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|The reviews that laud the authors writing ability are fair, but I'm left feeling this technical effort was a stunt with no purpose.  The story covers a large span of time using language authentic to those times.  Making the writing authentic to the times, comes only at the cost of making the reading difficult.  Nothing additional is conveyed in the writing styles.  Just the opposite, it leaves the reader to interpret the language.<br />The linkages between the various characters through time, added nothing to the total story.  Many of the individual stories where slow and of uninteresting consequence.  At the end the story only conveys a trivial message, not made more interesting by the laborious stories.<br />Overall, I feel misled by the other reviews.  I believe they are fairly praising the authors skill, but over praising the result.  Just because something is difficult to make, does not make it good.<br /><br />This is one of the few books, that may benefit from being edited down to a 2 hour screen play.
B005LAII0S|3.0|The disk was scratched so about 15 min. of the movie did not play. Next time I will spend the extra $10 and buy it new. I did receive my order quickly.
1400067936|3.0|You purchase a book and expect the \\"ride\\" thereafter, the experience of reading and understanding it to be free.  No such luck on this book.  It's more accurate to say, no such luck with this author.  Interesting and important facets of \\"randomness\\"  are presented from a singular point of view.  I denote randomness in quotations to denote a quasi- or pseudo- (erroneous) use of the term, at least in part.  Mr Taleb makes the common mistake to imply or overtly call everything unexplainable (by current methods) as being random.  Clearly this is not necessarily the case as extraordinarily complex deterministic systems that are not fully understood can be unpredictable to a new observer, but are not random.  The difference is not merely semantic.  Random process simulations  (i.e. Monte Carlo) might not properly model the complex deterministic elements  but could the truly random processes.  He is also occasionally contradictory -- not unexpected (and certainly tolerable) for mere commoners, but noteworthy for the genius Taleb holds himself to be.<br /><br />Why a 501st review?  What's not free about this \\"ride\\"?  As others have said, to enjoy this book; .........no that's not quite right...... to have judged the investment in time to have been worth it, might benefit from some advanced warning.  Taleb might be THE, certainly is one of THE most egotistical writers I've encountered.  He is ridiculously pompous to the point of absurdity (hardly a page goes by...).  He is openly contemptuous of anyone with a differing opinion.  He is an elitist of the highest order.  Note to Taleb.  If you're REALLY that bright and uniquely insightful, people will detect it, will know it.  You won't have to TELL them .....over and over and over and over again.  This reader concluded that Mr. Taleb has internal doubts that are only quelled by such repetition.<br /><br />Three stars is either a random score for this book, or it represents a composite value for some interesting points of view(4 stars) that the reader has to rescue-with-effort from Taleb's annoying attitude (2 stars).
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Loved every minute of it...Tara and Jax are the best! The show keeps me guessing every minute and every show.
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|Saw this presentation on PBS and had to order the DVD.  I'm new to LC - but this concert was simply amazing!  I really don't know how I've missed out hearing LC up until now.  His lyrics reached my soul; they made me smile and think.  I have a lot to be thankful for and seeing this concert is one of those things!
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I read the reviews on this game prior to purchasing and let me tell you that I was glad I still bought it! I'm sorry but this game is definitely worth $2! It has great graphics fun storyline great search and puzzles!!! It was everything I want in a game and spooky too. Please make more of these games just like this one! I highly recommend it and you wont be disappointed. Lots of fun so enjoy!!
B000002GW5|5.0|I bought this album on cassette tape when it was first released back in the 70's.  I later upgraded to vinyl, and then to CD.<br /><br />This album was an immediate favorite and remains so to this day.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Good movie but it wasn't nearly as good as the book, which I suppose is typical. There was just<br />too much going on to capture it all in a movie.

B0099Y2YL6|1.0|A number of reviews of British productions seem to indicate that certain dvds purchased will not play in US dvd players, with no mention of that in the product description.  Also, the same situation occurs when the product has been comverted to widescreen.  The advertisements for the products need to address these two issues.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has a big voice and  great range.  The variety of back-up instrumentation changes the mood and tempo.  The whole CD is captivating to listen to.  Adele 19 is a great CD and Adele 21 is even better
146500632X|5.0|Perfect item to keep track of the month of the year and important events.  Bought for my niece who is a huge one direction fan!
B0012GTZC0|3.0|\\"The Eye of the Needle\\" by Ken Follett is a great WWII story in which the Brits frantically search for a Nazi spy who has been loose in England for several years. What this spy finally discovers is likely to win the war for the Nazis if he can only put the information in the hands of Hitler. I am not going to go into the plot -- others have done that. I will only say that it is great fun to follow the twists and turns and to figure out who is up to what. The reason I didn't give 5 stars to the book is that there was too much graphic violence, too much explicit description of knifing enemies of the spy. Same with sex scenes -- too explicit for my taste and for  what I would want my teens to read. It's just tasteless, in my opinion. So, make your choice to read or not to read based on a wide variety of reviews, and if you read it, you may choose to do as I did -- by skipping the offending portions -- and you won't miss anything that contributes to the story. Mr. Follett is such a talented writer that he doesn't need to add the trash to the story. That only weakens it, in my opinion.

B00846REIS|4.0|great, easy fun read, finished it in less then 24 hours. if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will like this
B009CPEOC4|5.0|Surprising enough it was a good movie.. I didnt expect to like it. I got to know Katy Perry and what she was about.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|The movie was great!  Unfortunately, the audio quality on the HD streaming video I bought was so horrible it almost ruined the movie.  I had it cranked on my TV to max volume and still could barely make out some of the dialogue, so I had to keep rewinding the movie to catch what I missed.<br /><br />REALLY disappointed in the quality of the product delivered to me!
0525953728|5.0|Great book.  I read it in two sessions only because sleep is necessary for some people.  As a member of the team<br />that took out Osama bin Laden the author brings a perspective and integrity to the story.  The news<br />media never got it right, so buy and read this book!
B00881VLCE|4.0|It is a fun app if you like puzzles. The music. is slightly annoying but over all a good app
B007U1FEJE|4.0|No the Beach Boys are not permanently back together, but it was good to hear<br />them on this album.  Old sounds with some updated lyrics that take into<br />account that these guys are contemplating their past as they move into<br />the 70+ age bracket.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Wow, some of these reviewers take themselves way too much seriously. I will try to be brief-er. I will try not to result to expletives. I rented. I am overjoyed at this movie. The cast supreme, the story line excellent, the acting (except Samuel Jackson) prime. The whole movie-epitome. Some of the acting scenes may have been a bit glitchy, and scenes may seem sometimes too comic book, well that's what the movie is about, Free your mind & enjoy it without trying to be a film critic. A Disney movie where people die? Awesome. The battle between Iron Man & Thor? Iron Man & Hulk? Epic. The flying battleship with cloaking abilities? Insane, gotta get me one of them!. I finally after the second viewing, got the scene after the credits, that was the Scharma Iron Man referenced after the battle, whatever that is. We don't got them in central Ms, probably would have to wear my shoes or sumpin'. If you can let go of your senses, your elite-ism & just want to enjoy something, then this movie is for you. I laughed in some scenes until I cried. I might have been over enthusiastic about it, but it was what I perceived. Also, it was a good set up for the sequels. Rent or own this movie.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|Ok it's Maiden so there are going to be some good bits - but what a step backward from BNW, (which I would see as a 3.5 star album). Some of the choruses are plain awful - 'No more Liiiieeeees' repeated ad nauseum is just one example. And the cover art is easily the worst of any Iron Maiden album...by far. I seriously think there is one good album in this album and 'A Matter of Life and Death'.  Bruce's voice is increasingly being lost in these muddy mixes too. Time for a rethink Mr. Harris.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Definitely had entries i was looking for, i just got this and was happy it was on here,though it should have more slang
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I saw Lee Child on CBS discussing \\"Wanted Man\\" and was intrigued by the Jack Reacher Series.  I don't know how I missed these thrillers all this time.  I loved the Killing,  You really cannot tell a book from its cover!.  It was a great read, well written and a page turner thriller.  I am now on the 3rd in the Series.<br /><br />Years ago I loved to read James Patterson, but over the years the stories became very predicable poorly written and have simplistic plots.  I was looking for a strong, interesting character, who would hold my interest and stroke my imagination.  I guess you could say, I am now a Lee Child Fan and will keep reading!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was a great game...kept me playing for hours. loved the characters and the game play. will be playing this one again
0316228532|5.0|I had the same feeling while reading this book as I get while reading Potter - every page is pure entertainment. I couldn't put it down, but was devastated to reach the end. It was definitely an enjoyable reading experience for me, and I look forward to reading it the second time around to see what details went in one ear (eye?) and out the other the first time. I actually LIKED how none of the characters seem 'likable' in the beginning (and even when they were still that way at the end), and even though there are 15 or so \\"main\\" characters that the story revolves around, I found myself understanding and being able to relate to each one, and I think most people will too. With this book Rowling proves that she can be a master of reality as well as master of all things magical. A great work by a great author, it will not take long for my copy to become well-worn!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I got a huge kick out of this video.  The show is funny, wry and clever. I did not follow the show in its original run, nor am I at all in the original target demographic, but i still enjoyed it. It is slightly cynical and jaded but without the mean spirited tone of so many of the reality tv shows airing now. Interestingly, the one \\"flaw\\" cited by other reviewers did not bother me.  Many mentioned the lack of music from the show as a minus.  Since i did not see the originals, this did not seem to be a problem.  I only wish there were more Daria videos to buy.
B005DNO7MQ|4.0|I originally purchased Gladiator some years ago.  The video transfer was widely panned as a sub-standard effort in video transfer to Blu Ray.  I thought it barely better than standard DVD quality.  I bought it again and this time the transfer was excellent....much improvement.  If you want this film in your library it is worth the repurchase.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|This processor has been powering my custom PC for the past 2 weeks now. It runs perfectly, is very quiet, and has not given me any problems at all. I recommend it as a processor to my friends when they're building their own computer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app its amazing and you can download nods and skins with pocket tool. and x plodded but you need to be jail broken
B003LL3LHO|5.0|At first I was very unsure about this book. Being a long time fan of the games, I felt that I would be let down by the book. Luckily, however, I found it to be exceptionally pleasing. Having played the sequel game Guild Wars 2, I knew of all the places described in the book and I had expectations as a result. The authors did a good job. I was never disappointed. the characters are lovable and their interactions made for a good laugh. I would recommend the book to anyone who is a fan of either Guild Wars games.
B005IEGUDY|2.0|I love historical fiction, especially English. Unfortunately I abandoned this book after about 150 pages. Characters were one dimensional, story bland, and writing was too simplistic for my liking. I really wanted to like this book but it's no Ken Follett novel.
0316223239|5.0|I read the entire thing in 5 hours one evening after my son was asleep.  Having just had my first son right before I read this novel, a day doesn't go by now that I don't feel the impact of this book.  It is written so genuinely...even though the basis for this novel is horrible and nightmarish, I could relate to so much about this young mother's choices, hopes, fears, and sacrifices.  This book goes on the very top of my list.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game makes it really fun to just Doodle. For your doodles you get coins and with the coins you can get new colors.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephan King has out done himself. This is an interesting read, not full of scary horror that one expects of Stephen King but a well researched story about the Kennedy assassination and how someone tries to stop it. The time travel aspect is wonderfully done and comes together smoothly.  I loved the book.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I have been looking for an interesting TV show for a while. I saw the previews for this show and was intrigued. I was looking for a good show to try to scare me, and this one seemed like the one. I watched the first episode and fell in love with the show! I had never seen anything like it, it was amazing. I could feel that I could relate with some of the characters, like Moira. The show is really compelling, and I love the concept of an anthology TV series. Yet again, they made an amazing show that really anybody can find they enjoy.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Personally I love all of Phillippa Gregory's books and find this one up to her usual standard of excellence . A definite must read.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|A fun simple game that makes you retrieve your color palette knowledge from elementary school. I can't believe people are complaining about level 6 and no instructions.  Please go beyond your attention span of a gnat and give it another try. Router with a twist.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this app is pretty fun but gets really boring after a while. I played it and at first I loved it but then it just seemed to get old its the same thing every time
0525953728|5.0|A riveting book. You can't put it down. A glimpse into a world of heroes that most of us probably are not worthy of knowing about!
B0081X8AE6|4.0|Received his CD as a gift and it was wonderfully something different. His voice is memorably good. I liked more songs on this CD than I've been getting on more well known artists. Thumbs up for Michael. I would love to hear him live.

0345803485|1.0|I'm still shaking my head in disbelief as I close this book for the final time.  I was expecting a sexy book with a plot of some kind, but all I got was a poorly-written piece of trash with no real story or redeeming value.  The author must be laughing her homely self all the way to the bank. Any person with an imagination could have written this book...the vocabulary is elementary (really...describes a vagina as \\"down there\\"???).  It's like it's written by a poorly educated 19-year old, not a savvy middle-aged woman.  The only good thing about this book is its cover.
0439023513|1.0|This book is proof that not every series needs to be a trilogy.  It was long and  drawn out without a satisfying ending.  The author would have done better leaving the audience with at least the chance to fill in the blanks and give the characters the ending they deserve.
0345803485|3.0|Even after my boss told me that the 1st book did not live up to the hype, I still bought all 3 of them. I have to agree with the viewers who thought that the writing was juvenile. I love erotica, but this doesn't live up to the hype in the least. In the first few chapters of the first book, I rolled my eyes more than Ana.  I've already downloaded them to my Kindle, so I'll finish the series, but I wouldn't buy anything else from this writer.  Morbid curiosity makes me wonder just how this is going to end! I do have to say that I cracked up at the reviews where people counted the repetitive phrases, gentures, etc. [rolling my eyes again]

B0094KF4WG|4.0|I wanted to read about the most spectacular USA special forces operation: the killing of super terrorist  Bin Laden.<br />This memoir is a well written account on how the operation was actually conducted, additionally we get a glimpse of life and spirit of the troups. Being a diehard civilian I cannot judge whether<br />any military secrets were actually disclosed.<br />Now for the sad part. Reading this story we get into the mind of a guy whose brain is as different from mine as the one of a velociraptor. He loves guns and shooting: even two weeks with his family is to long for him - he wants intensely to return to the shooting range. What is most disturbing: this guy actually LIKES to kill people, it's his kicks and apparently his buddies share this attitude. A special vocabulary is used: the opponents are not men, they are \\"movers\\" etc. The book gives us an insight in the mind of a killer, rivalling the Truman Capote book \\"In cold blood\\".<br />Maybe our democracies need this kind of people for their defence but the autor is definitly not a person I would like to meet.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|Must not waste your life/time/ trying to figure our this plot, or why you should care for the characters. Its xenia warrior princess meets harry potter and brother grimm. In all the wrong ways. Unless you are 16, and highly susceptible to special effects, and have no expectations. In which case this movie was made for you. 12-21 year olds enjoy. Other wise you will regret it, like I still do. waste of time.

B0050CQY1W|3.0|The main reason I bought this cd was because iTunes was giving away a free video of Bey singing \\"I was Here\\". I was very impressed with the song; although I had already heard two other tracks from the dics via television, the mentioned song made me go out and buy this album. I wasn't impressed with the entire cd, and only listen to tracks one, four, eleven, and twelve. I love Beyonce and and how she has carried herself all these years, so I didn't mind this disc not living up to my imaginary standards of her. The cd is good listening if its playing in the background, in my opinion.

0061433063|5.0|Tiffany Aching feels it - an evil not seen but present. On top of everything else she has to deal with, a dying Baron,Roland's impending nuptials,  a coven of witches watching and the 'helping' MacFeegles, she has to try and conquer the evil.<br /><br />Pratchett writes of Discworld, but really he is talking about our humanity. You can't read any of his books without seeing yourself reflected - for good or for bad. This book was a little darker than some of his others, but even in the darkest times there is a light. As usual Pratchett has written a masterpiece.
0345803485|4.0|I ended up reading Fifty Shades of Grey because a friend in my school mother's group said she was reading it. She described what was in it (she's the most conservative person btw)and I must admit I never even knew such books existed. But I was in a bookshop one day and it was on special so I thought why not. Wow, it did hold my interest even though it is admittedly not the greatest prose and some of the repititious sayings of Ana are annoying. But it held my interest till the end as I actually wanted to know what happened to Ana. I thought the power struggle between Ana and Christian was quite fascinating.<br /><br />I must be one of those naive desperate housewives that didn't know about BDSM, don't intend trying it out but it was fascinating to read about it. Do people really do that stuff? How many of them do??<br />What's been the most interesting is reading the amazon reviews, some are written by the most intelligent people who write really well! I'm going to read the last two books, the first book seemed to stop in the middle of the situation with no resolution and one feels that one needs to read the rest of the books to get the whole story.
0547258305|4.0|Let me tell you, if you love a kick-ass heroin, Katsa is your girl. Katsa learned at an early age she was gifted with the Grace of killing. This is how she has seen herself her whole life--as a monster, a killer--and this is how everyone around her sees her. However, as we find out, there is a whole lot more to Katsa than just killing.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters in Graceling. Katsa is so much fun. She's pretty much straightforward in her way of thinking. Po was a lot of fun, too. I fell in love with his character immediately. I like how we got to see both grow and mature throughout the story, and though there was a lot of action in this book, it was balanced out with the romance between Katsa and Po, which was sweet and spicy. Bitterblue was a great character, too. I am looking forward to reading more about her.<br /><br />I loved the world Graceling was created into and the descriptiveness of the author as she described the settings. I was able to easily picture in my head the different scenes. I also enjoyed the author's writing style, which was simple and flowed easily.<br /><br />My only real complaint about this book was that the second half was a bit slow. There was a lot of traveling going on during this point in the book, which of course by horseback takes weeks, even months, and there just was not a lot going on in the story. It was not boring, just not up to the standards the first half of the book set. Oh, I guess one more complaint...I hear that the sequel is not actually a sequel and the third book's focus is on Bitterblue, which I am looking forward to, but what I really want is more of Katsa and Po. I want to know what happens to them after Graceling. The way the book ended there are so many possibilities.<br /><br />I listened to the audio of Graceling. It was the best audio I have ever listened to. Rather than a single narrator, it has a full cast, complete with music, so you got the whole effect of the story. It was really neat.

0316228532|1.0|I, like so many others, looked forward to J.K. Rowling's first book after the Harry Potter series.  I ground through the first 25%, thinking that it had to get better, that there had to be a developed character somewhere.  It didn't; there wasn't.  'Nuff said.

B002HK9IDQ|1.0|If someone in your house is hearing impaired, or just wants to view the words along with the movie, DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO, unless you like hearing the words in English and reading subtitles in Brazilian Portuguese.

0670023329|5.0|A unique and haunting story written from a perspective like no other, from a guy who was bred and born to be a slave under the most inhumane conditions. His life in the brutal camp and the miracle of his escape is a story that had to be told and is simply fascinating to ponder.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|First I want to say that when I look for a book on Amazon to read (fiction that is), I am not looking for the world's next literary masterpiece. I am looking for a story that I can fall deep inside and escape to for a day or so. This is one of those books.<br /><br />The reason why is that the main character Travis (the anti hero) is someone that most of us remember from high school, college, or the neighborhood. The tough guy. The angry guy. The HOT guy! And how his friendship and ultimately romance develops with the main female character of this book (Abby a.k.a. Pigeon:) is remarkably how many 17 year olds probably fantasized how they would fall in love with the \\"bad boy\\" who they admired from afar.<br /><br />The relationship is not \\"easy\\". It's difficult. It goes back and forth. There are arguments. There's a lot of dumb stuff said or done. But that's what makes this story so \\"real\\" to me. I felt like I really knew this guy and wished that I had really known this guy:) I really think that's why the second book is so anticipated by those of us who have read this one, because it will be told from Travis point of view and we're dying to know what was he thinking, what did he really mean when he said or did some of the things that he did in the story.<br /><br />I read a LOT of fiction in this genre, but this is a particular book that I've read about 4 times. For me that's CRAZZZZY. That's how I know I have fallen in love with that character!<br /><br />On a purely plot driven note -- the only thing that I didn't \\"love\\" about this book was how the author transitioned into the whole \\"Vegas\\" storyline. Our character Abby kind of transforms with a flip of a switch into this card shark for a father she spent all this energy trying to \\"get rid of\\". It was a bit awkward and felt kind of forced -- but that's just my opinion and it didn't deter me from reading the book repeated times.<br /><br />Final Note: Maybe it's me, but anyone that has a problem with Travis' temper in this book has never been to a college party. There are angry, drunk guys all over the place! I'm not saying it's cool, but it's very much reality.n this book has never been to a college party. There are angry, drunk guys all over the place! I'm not saying it's cool, but it's very much reality.
014241543X|5.0|All the buzz you've heard about \\"If I Stay\\" is true. I initially discovered this novel while researching to see if any other novels had claimed a title I'm planning to use. I stumbled on this and loved the cover. The premise sounded interesting enough I ordered a used copy and what I received delivered much more than I expected. Forman dives into a point of view that is truly unique and heart wrenching. While it surprisingly didn't move me to tears, I felt the emotions Mia and her family went through just as keenly on the inside.<br />I've heard they're making this novel into a movie and have been comparing it to Twilight. I don't understand why they would, when this book is much better and thought provoking than Twilight will ever be. But I am excited to see the adaptation when it comes out.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something deeper than their usual New Adult read.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|In my opinion, only free apps should have in app purchases. Anyways, I am on the kindle fire and it is working fine, with the superpowers and everything.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My daughter and I both love this movie.We can't wait for the thrid season to see what happeneds to everyone playing on it.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I'll begin by conceding what a lot of the negative reviews dwell on: there's not much plot, there's not much character development, and if you try to look at the movie from an objective, critical viewpoint, it kind of looks like a farce without any humor. In other words, this movie does not contain any of the elements that our current critical dogma posits are necessary to make a 'good' movie.<br /><br />And yet I loved this movie, and posit that looking back twenty years from now it will be considered a classic.<br /><br />I love a good, well-written drama, but Snyder is taking full advantage of technology and the artistic limitations and advantages that film offers to create something working on a different level. He lets gorgeous visuals, aerobic action scenes, and brilliantly-chosen songs do a lot of the emotional heavy lifting for him. The music in this film, particularly, is not just background accompaniment or snippets of popular songs that the viewers already like. Music is probably the best art form in terms of creating pure emotion, and Snyder leverages that power as much as he can. Where most writers and directors want the words and the plot to create the emotion, Snyder is using the power of music. Same with the visuals. Tarantino kind of moved cinema in this direction, but he was always so obsessed with how smart he is and his witty dialogue that Tarantino himself would be a character in all of his movies even if he didn't throw himself into cameo roles.<br /><br />So the movie creates an emotional interest in the viewer through the music and the visuals. So what? What are the emotions serving? What's the point? To me, Sucker Punch is a wake-up call to the audience, a plea for us to live our lives like we mean them, and to believe that we have tools that we can use, even when it's not apparent. That may sound a little gooey and self-help-y, but it's an important message in our media-saturated world, and to deliver that message through a hyper-mediated movie, where we're looking at three different levels of reality, all obviously fake, is something I imagine an ambitious grad student could write a good paper on, if he had the balls to stand up to the criticism. And it's not a sappy, feel-good movie, when it comes down to it. You have to wrap positive messages in a lot of darkness in order for them to feel credible to modern audiences, and that's exactly what Snyder does in this movie.<br /><br />Lastly, a lot of the negative reviews, as well as the positive reviews, seem to focus on the over-sexualized nature of the girls. I think they're all missing something: much as Gladiator implicated the audiences' love of violence even as it titillated that same love of violence, Sucker Punch implicates the audiences' participation in the objectification of women even as it presents beautiful women in skimpy outfits. This dissonance actually makes you think about how much sexualization and exploitation we take for granted in media, in a much more thoughtful way than most 'hot girl kicks ass' movies could ever hope to do. And, for the record, the girls are certainly dress sexy, but in a romanticized way, with elaborate costumes and pretty jewelry. No thongs here. No nudity. No actual sex. So in ways it's much less exploitative than a lot of what's out there, and it serves to make you think differently about the amount of female exploitation we take for granted in the media.<br /><br />Long story short, if you can get into it, which I admit may be difficult for people to do if they're not already familiar with the geeky tropes this movie celebrates, this movie is incredibly entertaining and actually makes you think about the way we consume entertainment. It's far more than the negative reviews imply, but not everyone is going to 'get it,' because it's not trying to work in the ways that most movies do.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I commend the author in writing this book. Getting a first hand view out while not compromising national security is important for all Americans. Thank you Mark Owens
B0068LYEHA|1.0|I wonder if at the age of 67 I am too old, with too many memories and experiences of my own, to be able to enjoy this book, because I just found it totally boring, unnecessary, pointless, tedious and a waste of time.  I did, however, continue plodding through it laboriously until the end - still waiting for some great revelation, but it never came.  How on earth did it become a best seller?
B007SGM084|2.0|I couldn`t finish it.  I been skipping over sex parts, boring.  Ana is a nag and Grey is a Jerk and a ticking time bomb. If I were Ana, I` run and not look back. Not the best book I've ever read.  The characters have the same conversation over and over. The story is long and drawn out. It wasn`t even that interesting. What a waste of my life.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|After being disappointed by Year one (which was ok at best), I went into this expecting the same sort of thing. The adaptation of Year One was very bland and rushed and they made many changes that made no sense to me. The acting was sub par and the animation and music did not come close to matching the feel of the comic.<br /><br />I'm relieved that TDKR part I doesn't share the same problems as the Year One adaptation. This one almost feels like a high quality theatrical film and not at all like a straight-to-dvd flick. Like Year One, This isn't a panel for panel accurate adaptation, but the changes they made here aren't as silly. For example, The Mutant Leader grins when he sees his gang gathered, just before Batman tackles him. That is not in the comic, but I thought that was a pretty nice touch. I'm also glad this was split into two parts because it needed to be.<br /><br />The voice acting was top-notch. Peter Weller was perfectly cast as an older Bruce/Batman. Conroy would have felt out of place here so I'm glad they went with Weller. Same goes for the rest of the cast, great performances. The music was my favorite part of this because it has a very 80s feel. It also sets the mood of the film so nicely, as a score should. There's even a scene where Bruce is passing some gang members who are blasting 80s pop from a boombox. The one downside for me is the animation, It's well animated and the simplified Miller designs are great, but it's a tad bright in some places and too colorful in others. For the most part, this movie looks very much like an animated version of Miller's classic graphic novel. So this still gets 5 stars from me. Great Job to Jay Oliva and everyone else involved in this one.

B001O1O71C|5.0|Although I agree that the naïvet&eacute; of Bruno was perhaps forced, this story stillt takes us to an important piece of history.  Bruno wants so much to be proud of his father.  He lives I the bleakest of times, when even most Aryan children do without much of what Bruno takes for granted.  He lives a life of the privileged upper ranks of the SS.  His friendship with the Jewish inmate of his fathers camp, opens his eyes, and hopefully our own.
B000RLFBP6|3.0|A Robocop; a police officer that's part man and part machine; isn't a bad idea. Even given the malfunctions that are bound to happen, it has many advantages over a regular person in a uniform. There's a point here in which a man; a potential rapist; is holding a woman at knife-point. A regular cop would have to hold fire to avoid the risk of shooting the victim by mistake. But even with the woman struggling about in panic, Robocop is able to aim between her legs and shoot the man in the groin without hitting her. It's a risky move that takes the careful calculation of a sophisticated robot mind.<br /><br />He also has super-human strength. He's able to bend the barrel of a gun with his bare hand. So the violent criminals of Detroit don't stand a chance while Robocop is on the force. The problem is the psychological baggage from the part of him that's human. He used to be a normal cop until he was gunned down by a notorious street gang. Now he's essentially dead; a man with a loving wife and kid replaced by a set of computer codes, prime directives and a dry corny sense of humor. But he still has memories, and emotions, and that, along with an open mouth area, makes him somewhat vulnerable.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B0065GC0BA|5.0|you might almost call this a holiday read:easy, light and soon forgotten. but no. the characters become friends. i, at least, felt part of the family - a real english family with english humour. but the most important character, will, is the one who comes to life most. hence the devastation at the end. i read it quickly without much thought, but the book stayed with me for days after i finished it. jojo moyes has attacked a very sensitive and relevant issue and left you not sure how you feel about it. well done. we all need to think again.

B009IJJ8UM|5.0|A very charming if not slighly disarming twist on an old tale.  Sherlock is not your typical consulting detective in this one.  When he had only one hour to be released formally from rehab, he releases himself.  Watson, a retired doctor now is a live in rehab counselor, and imspector Gregson (a character from The Red Headed League) is a police leut. in NYPD.  Yep, not your typical Holmes but all the more reasons to enjoy it.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie considering I watched it on a whim. It felt like a fun 80's throwback, somehow reminding me of the Goonies- one of my favourite childhood movies. It had that same sense of youthful adventure and escapism, admittedly with a somewhat darker tone. The cinematography was simply beautiful and the acting extraordinary, especially on the part of Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, who gave very nuanced performances. I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
B008RYN44U|2.0|I can't believe this is what happens after an 11 year wait. I was so excited, I have been in love with this band since I was in 5th grade but this is not good. Push and Shove and Settle Down are the only two songs i like on this album and I probably won't give the entire thing more than one listen. I pretty much bought the album since I have all of their other ones and I hate when my collection has a blank space. I feel like the band got lazy and just threw something together because they had to come out with something after all the hype. I miss the old No Doubt, hopefully this isn't the last album to come out from them because what a bad way to go out.

0385344333|4.0|...but I'm a bit shocked by how many negative reviews there are for this book. I'm a Reacher series fan, and I've read them all. Is this the best Reacher book? Not by a long shot. But it's certainly not the worst (that dubious honor goes to \\"Nothing to Lose\\" in my humble opinion). It does drag a bit, especially in the beginning, but the action is intense enough once it gets going.<br /><br />Like some other reviewers here, I think that Lee Child was trying something different. I think he's trying to keep the character alive while not basically writing the same story over and over with different characters. That's a hard, fine line to walk, and in my opinion he's doing it very well.<br /><br />Honestly I think the people giving this book low reviews are just a little too wound up. I wait eagerly for the latest Reacher book to come out, just like they do, but I don't expect every single one to be better than the last. No author can hit a home run with every book. Some will be better and some will be worse. This one isn't one of the best in the series, but it's certainly not terrible, and it's not a waste of time or money.<br /><br />In short, I feel that a sub-par Child book is still far better than anything else out on the market right now.

0316228532|1.0|in writing a fabulous and entertaining series aimed at children, yet enjoyed by millions and millions of adults!!  And there's nothing wrong in selling 450 million copies of your wonderful series!<br />So why attempt to fight your success by writing a depressing, boring and extremely provincial \\"adult\\" book and hype it using your wonderful reputation?  This is clearly a classic case of the Emperor's new clothes.  Obviously those around Ms. Rowling all told her how fantastic the book was and \\"yes'd\\" her to death so that she believed her audience would want to receive dreary Pagford with open arms.<br />I feel like she is a fabulous chef who, for years fed us all these wonderful and delicious meals.  And then something happened, she cut us all off. Closed the shop.<br />And then re-opened again to great fanfare, only to serve up a dreadful stew of the most inedible entails, bugs, moldy scraps, smelly, strong, spiced up, aged and completely discordant ingredients.<br />Why?<br />Did we do something wrong?  Did we not love her and her books enough?<br />SO sorry she \\"doesn't want to write about Harry or the next generation\\" again...boo hoo.

0300176147|4.0|This is a nicely told tale living up to exactly what the title states - a little history of the world, at least through the 1930's when this book was first published.  Gombrich's storytelling is extreme in its clarity with a lyrical conversational tone that would be perfectly natural if coming from a grandparent passing on tales of yore to the young'uns.  The brief chapter format provides for excellent pacing and overall this makes for a refreshing reading experience if only to hear Gombrich's take on things.

B005C9YZKU|5.0|Quite possibly the best way to show off the home theater system. Absolutely amazing picture. The ultimate edition packaging shaped like a globe is really nice touch as well.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy Pinterest on my PC.  However, it's difficult to manuver on the Kindle.  The app doesn't flow like the PC version.  But it does provide the basic features.  I am still able to share interests with friends.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the big keys and being able to see what I had already entered.  it makes balancing my check book a breeze.
B00000E0YH|5.0|I'm a fan of Crimson Glory.  Have been for decades.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  The rock is a bit hard at times, but then i don't know many albums where every song is awesome.  Floyd and Queensryche are the only 2 that come to mind where every song rocks.  Maybe Maiden too.
0670023329|4.0|An interesting, true story of Shin Donghyuk who was born in a North Korean prison camp and later manages the rare feat of escape.  The unique take on this one is that Shin's story contains none of the bravado you'd expect with such tales where the hero channels superhuman strength and energy to break the chains of bondage.  Instead, Shin is portrayed as a flawed individual who sometimes made morally unscrupulous decisions to keep himself alive as well as the beneficiary of amazing turns of luck.  Still, the saga itself is very well told and accentuated further with background detail on the horrors that goes on in a NK prison camp.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I was on the fence about buying this book after reading the reviews here.  I've read my share of Neal Stephenson, Daniel Suarez and William Hertling, but I don't consider myself a cyber-fiction/cyber-thriller maven by any means.  I prefer straight-up crime fiction.<br /><br />However, I do work in new media and have some knowledge of the technical issues at play in books like Zero Day, so I figured I'd give this novel a try.<br /><br />I know Russinovich is a technical genius, and it's apparent from the start that he knows as much about computer viruses, hacker/cracker culture and security systems as anyone.  In fact, the details in the book are wonderful for anyone who loves to dig deep on that subject matter, but for the casual reader the details and explanations might prove tedious after a while.  The narrative does at times get bogged down in coding details, but Zero Day is also an exciting thriller.<br /><br />Towards the end, Russinovich ramps up the action, and the story does stretch plausibility a bit, but overall I was entertained.  Enough so that I'm going to read Trojan Horse, his follow-up novel.<br /><br />I think William Gibson fans would really love this guy.  Recommended.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|like my title it is the best it always get mine right only upset is one one category but it is awesome
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Cannot beat this deal and Sherlock can be read over and over.  It also includes some illustrations.  Other offerings cost more and give you less.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I love Mickey Haller books but the ending did not resolve any of the questions I had about the main subject. If he resolves it in another book later, then it will be worth it but I was left disappointed.
B0098VXCR0|5.0|We liked this movie. It was entertaining and had quite the spin from the original Snow White that we grew up with.  A few scenes which we though were going to be predictable were a pleasant surprise.  There was even a bit of comedy in this movie.  It is fairly dark, so not for kids, but a good movie.  We would recommend it.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|like everyone else it would be a great game if it worked correctly...on my kindle fire I just end up tapping and nothing happens like trying to hang the photo up and forget trying to do the robot puzzle....I am very aggravated with this game at this moment....do something about it!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I got this app because I heard it was like Pictureka. I got it. It was fun at first but then some games are just not fun because there are some HORRIBLE DRAWERS OUT THERE! One of my opponents was trying to draw beans. They looked like freaking red shoes! And the game is just horrible. I've tried to quit the game but it seems impossible. If you don't want to play anymore, it doesn't met you quit. You just go back to square one! Its horrible and it needs to be fixed. Plus, when you run out of bombs in the game, you have to buy more coins in order to BUY more bombs. If you cant do that, you have to earn them the long difficult way. Playing.This game is not my favorite and I only recommend it if you are truly bloody bored.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book!! It is definitely racy and different but the live story is so powerful that you can't put the book down!
B0085MNZ66|5.0|early reviews have been kinda rough but the concept was intriguing so I decided to give it a try.  I'm on level 8 no problems.  some complain about back key but may be kindle only cause my phone's back key does the job (nexus).  I am stumped by science mode and would have been 4 stars for that but gave 5 due to uniqueness.  it's got some challenge and looks like to I'll be in it for a few days!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|IF THEY WANT SOMEONE TO BUY THIS, THEY SHOULD FIX IT TO TILT STEERING OR MAYBE DELETE IT. TOTAL WASTE OF MY FREE TIME AND KINLDE MEMORY.  I SUPPOSE IT WOULD SUCK EVEN MORE ON AN I-POD OR SMALLER PHONE. ALSO, YOU HAVE TO *AHEM* BUY THE FULL VERSION WICH IS THE SAME EXCEPT YOU HAVE MORE CHARCTERS AND THERE IS A MULTIPLAYER OPTION.  I CAN NOT,&Ntilde;OT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS GAME...............  WTF TO NAMCO.  YOU CAN DO BETTER.  WAIT,YOU CANT
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This original version of DUNE is one of my all time favorite movies.  I can't even count how many times i've watched this.  I've watched all the knock off versions too and none compare to this particular version.  Highly recommend.
B0087HT36U|5.0|The game is like angry birds, but I like the visuals better. Some of the chain reactions are cool and well thought out.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this book in two days time. Could hardly put it down. There is nothing that I would consider secret that has been written in it this book that the people in our government has not already said.
B004UID2LC|3.0|first of all when I first got it was the best but now when I try to watch a video it says connection error please check your Internet when my Internet is full bars really makes me mad (plz fix)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so much better than most games on the market. doesn't even require pay to play. this is for sure my new favorite.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Well written, well researched novel about the War of the Roses. Character development could have been a bit better, but emphasis on the women made other characters less than major. Interesting by-line on an interesting moment in history.
B00000K3CK|5.0|This is timeless.  Great quality.  Appropriate for all in the family.  We watch every holiday season and it never seems to get old.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this a fun and stimulating game. it helps you put your mind to work and enjoy it. it has so many different levels and it makes you want to play more and more. you want to beat your own high score.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game is ok......but it could be faster and the tutorial is unnecessary ......I mean the game is self explanatory pretty much
B005LAII8A|5.0|It's been a long time since I felt complete satisfaction about a thriller/drama/science fiction time travel. This Awesome movie has it all. Time travel is utilized by hired killers, Bruce Willis and entire cast give outstanding acting performance. The thrilling story grabs your attention, and this film entertains from start to finish. Special Effects are Good, and this is one of the best science fiction films of the year. 'Looper' understands the visual power of violence. Overall, this movie is Intelligent and enjoyable. It aims to please all thriller/science fiction lovers. The drama is intense, and there's explosive action. Highly Recommended for all those who love time travel stories and science fiction. This is one I would watch again!
B0099G3I96|5.0|The first single brought back warm and fuzzies for me... my memories of first hearing and falling in love with No Doubt many years ago.  Then the second single gave me an even bigger feeling of nostalgia.  As a long time fan, I have to say this album is super lovable; no it doesn't sound exactly the same as their first big hits, but it FEELS exactly the same.  This is what's so amazing about this album.  Love it.  Love that amazing voice and passion, Gwen!  :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|you version app is so awesome i love love using it so easy... love that is has different reading plans, im currently doind the bible in year, love that it has audio Bible.
B00021R7CG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites if you like the nuclear war holocost type movies.  All star cast.  And even today, i think it's somewhat realistic, which is why it's still, such a good movie.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|It would be nice to be able to use my existing alarm tones. The choices in this app are pretty limited for no good reason.
B00992CF6W|5.0|dear mojang i would LOVE if you put water and lava buckets on the game.it would be cool.P.S i have made Awesome water slides
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is very addictive. It wont let you continue unless you rate it though. This is the only reason I rate it as 4 stars and not 5.
0676979343|5.0|I have listened to the audiobook of this twice. It is the best, most vivid writing I have read in a long time, and the stories are absorbing. It is difficult for me to believe that this book doesn't have all 5 star reviews. I am more impressed with it than interpreter of maladies.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game but got to level 98 and it started me back at beginning.  ugh! didn't know how to get it back to 98 so started it over.
B000083C49|5.0|This is a series we watch annually.  You just can't go wrong with the Star Trek movies.  Timeless classics.  I just wish they were younger and made more movies with original characters.
0345803507|5.0|I read the trilogy of fifty shades in two weeks, which is a lot of reading for me.  I just couldn't put it down and had to know what happened next.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like. knowing if my kindell is dying or not with the numbers below I really enjoying this app on my kindell to know like everyone wants to know (anyone who is thinking about getting it or not just get it) :D
B0084IG7KC|5.0|A lot of people is just angry because they liked the book a lot more than the movie, I read the 3 books and of course the movie is missing somethings from them, but it doesn't matter, it's a great movie that focus on the very core of the book. Give it a try with an open mind, I think the director and the writers have done a terrific job here.<br /><br />Having said that, The Blu-ray format it's just great, it has a very good quality! I live in Mexico and I had to return the \\"Mexican Blu-ray disc\\" because it was in 16:9 aspect ratio, not in it's original format... that's a shame, is like selling fake HD. So I had to buy the US version of the disc to get the original format and quality, and it also comes with a digital download which is great for iTunes or Vudu users.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Doesn't save pages when you quit and only one page @ a time. Other than that, it's a great app.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|great for great quality, fast edits. fast save and share features to Facebook or twitter. customizable color themes. overall great photo app.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We have been big fans of LOST.  Even now, we throw in a disk now and then and still enjoy the show.  Highly recommended.
0345803493|5.0|Loved the trilogy of fifty shades....I couldn't put it down.  It will be interesting to see how they make this a movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Brilliant. Better than the movie. Was excited to pick it up and read more. katniss is admirable and still so human in her ways.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have Pinterest on my Kindle,  it is slow loading. I also use it on other devices and love to spend time in it.
B004N622EY|4.0|Loved the characters - also the mysteries which are not yet solved in this book and still wait to be understood.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I blasted through this book, but really enjoyed it.  There were several points that had me laughing out loud, especially the end of the main part of the novel.  I thought each coda was better than the prior one, and found the third very touching.  Before this I had never heard of John Scalzi, but this book was recommended by a friend.  Now I may go back and check out his other work.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Excellent acting, directing, casting, and story.  Can watch it once a year and not grow tired of it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. It's what all apps should strive to be. Useful,  easy and nice looking. Three more words.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this in the theater and could not wait for the DVD ,,,, I definitely want to own this one.  There is just something about the \\"Brit movies\\" that I can't resist. This whole movie is a fantasy, but there is a big dose of reality there.  I am convinced now that it is O.K. to take a risk in your golden years. In fact, it's a darn good idea!  The cast is  outstanding, especially Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.  (Remember them together in \\"Ladies in Lavender\\"?)<br /><br />See this one. It is clever, fun, and definitely thought-provoking.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Friends had recommended Florence + the Machine to me before, but I hadn't investigated.  Heard them on Pandora and knew I had to buy at least one album.  The music on Ceremonials is incredible.  I have heard pieces from it on several TV shows lately which means they also think it is good.  Definitely an album to acquire.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is great, because I can actually access and enjoy Pinterest on my Kindle Fire, which I previously wasn't able to do. The limited screen space just wasn't cutting in the normal webpage version. Having this app allows me to quickly tap into Pinterest with ease and post without difficulty. However, I am only giving four stars because it often doesn't load correctly, and it has to be reloaded sometimes more than once. For this reason I will say that I think it could use some overall improvement.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I discovered this album when I was a 15 year old girl. Yes has ALWAYS been my most cherrished band/composers. I love the complexity of the music- and when I listen to it, I FEEL every note! It is sublime. It brings me as much joy now, as it did way back when.  SERIOUSLY!!!  Did I mention that I LOVE this album??? :)
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I'm just a regular reader who likes different type of books. But, this one swept me away. Excellent book, really recomend it! Has love, not so rough sex (as I thout would be , and it was reason for not reading it immediately),life-ish book.. True modern woman book.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|The movie arrived in excellent condition and on schedule. I had seen the movie at the theater and liked it for my library. As an individual movie, when I saw it again, I wondered about the script....highly unlikely? yep....but it was still a cute movie and I'm happy to have purchased it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Childs scores again with another Reacher classic. Jack continues to be true to his personal code, and his charisma is solid.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Where do I begin..... This book is unreal. This story this guys tells is very inspiring and really makes you appreciate what these guys do for our country. It puts it all in perspective for sure. You buy it and you will not be disappointed. Guaranteed.<br />-ONE BITE AT A TIME
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it so much playing non stop level up up up<br />family. fun I a winner<br />so fun so fun fun
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|This album is amazing!!!! I love every single song. Mark Foster has an incredible voice and the sounds are hypnotizing.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie going in. I don't watch TV anymore, so I don't see trailers on a regular basis. Only if I go searching for them online. I'm not usually into movies like this...referring to the type of violence. I don't like boxing. I mean, I can watch movie fighting, I'm not that sensitive, it's just not what I prefer. So, you might be wondering why I even watched it in the first place. Well...I have to be honest. It was because of Tom Hardy. I just think he's an amazing actor. He's like Daniel Day-Lewis plus Robert DeNiro and maybe even a dash of Lawrence Olivier thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />I watched Bronson a couple of years ago, and I thought if I can sit through that for Tom Hardy, surely I can watch this movie. If you haven't seen Bronson, you won't know what I'm referring to. Not that it was very much like this movie, just that the character he plays is violent and angry and well, kinda crazy..okay, well, a lot crazy.<br /><br />The character he plays in this movie isn't exactly crazy, but he is angry. I don't want to give anything specific away about the movie, but I'll just say his character has issues.<br /><br />Well, I'm glad I gave it a chance, because I ended up liking it a lot. Yes, there are fight scenes that made me not want to watch, but I didn't exactly sit here with my eyes covered. The fighting, I thought, was realistic, not over-done or gratuitous. I found myself wanting certain things to happen, or characters to say what I thought they should say, but it was okay that they didn't. It makes it more real when it's not all tied up with a neat little bow. And that's what makes great story-telling.<br /><br />And it is the story here that hooks you. I didn't even think of not finishing it. The script was excellent, and the acting superb. Nick Nolte's character was painful to watch, but Nick's performance was wonderful. I realized after it was over that Tom Hardy's character didn't really have much dialogue, but you don't notice that as you're watching. Joel Edgarton was awesome, and I thought Jennifer Morrison (who currently plays Emma in the TV series Once Upon a Time) who plays his wife here, was perfectly cast. She was just right.<br /><br />It's hard to find a movie that brings it all together so well and makes you feel like it was time well spent. I felt that this really was one of those movies. Just good entertainment.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it<br />easy enough to play but hard enough to win ..keeps you wanting you play more and more. I would recommend it for everyone.
0062101897|5.0|This book is full of everything Harry Potter, I love it. It will take me hours possibly days to get through this book. My daughters love looking at all the pictures and relating them back to the movie. The pictures are beautiful the explanations are great. I will treasure this book with all my other Harry Potter Memorabilia. Thank you
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I ordered the item thinking it was going to be some cheap piece of plastic. Instead I received a high quality head that was the replica of the guy on the bus. The mask is actually rubber and the paint is high quality. The detail is amazing and flawless. Great job!
B003XQM2YU|1.0|Do not take history or literature lessons from this movie.<br /><br />A movie made by NBCU...which is a company that Orwell couldn't have even made up. Remember 'Running Man'...NBCU is the real-life version of the \\"network\\".<br /><br />A movie by Ridley Scott....extreme left-wing liberal that intentionally re-writes history for political reasons (see 1984).<br /><br />Anybody that knows history knows the Crusaders were extremely Christian. Extremely! The knights were like hardcore Samaria-style Christian fighters. They mastered the Western martial arts (see ARMA publications). The knights were nobles that started learning to fight at 8 years old; they were highly Christian indoctrinated. They were pretty hard to fight too....they thought it was unfair to fight an enemy if the enemy didn't have greater than 3-1 superiority.<br /><br />The Ridley Scott liberal-progressive-rewrite-history camp wants you to believe that a Robert Loxley (or any crusader) would be dieing and thank \\"the fates\\". (The fates???!!!)<br /><br />No.<br /><br />These liberals are so determined to rewrite history and lore....so determined to exterminate Christianity....that they want you to believe Christian Crusaders prayed to fates (karma etc) instead of....ohhh geeee whizzz.....Christ? Come the hell on!<br /><br />A movie about a crusader that never mentions Christ. Ok.<br /><br />Also, a movie after 1066 that has the king and all the royalty speaking English.....??? After 1066 (Battle of Hastings), England was controlled by Normans (and France). All the nobility in England spoke French or French creoles (is why 15% of American English is French words). Richard the Lionheart and King John were famous for not knowing, and not speaking, any English.<br /><br />Why is a movie taking place when French royalty controlled England going to war with France? Because it is a Ridley Scott movie that has no basis on reality.<br /><br />More liberals re-writing history. (Kind of like another Ridely Scott movie: Kingdom of Heaven. Where Saladin is portrayed as a nice peace-loving king....a guy that would cut your head off for being an infidel. Thanks Ridley...)<br /><br />This movie....entertaining. But do not.......do not....take your history lessons from this.
B008Y212PI|5.0|So identical to the game pixel perfect on the origional kindle. Love it!!!! I can not wait for more puzzles.  I have completed all of them so far...too much fun.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent book, grabbed my attention immediately. Lee Child's Reacher is a one of a kind individual in the role played out in books. A nail biter to the end.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Saw Marvel's The Avengers when it was first released in the theaters, three times. Thought it was marvelous then and still do now. The individual movies were great and the collective was fantastic. The original actors returned to the signature roles; Robert Downey Jr., as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America were their usual best. Add to the cast newcomers: Mark Ruffalo, as The Hulk, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner and you have one of the best super hero movies in years. And let's not forget Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and you've got a masterpiece.
1612680011|5.0|OMG This is probably the best book i read in my life, and it motivated me into saving, cutting cost, and the idea of turning $10,000 cash int he bank into a million. It shipped fast, and was practically brand new.
1401232590|5.0|The art work and print quality are great.  The story is one of the best and keeps you guessing till the end.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Blu Ray disk came in canister with lots of extras. Very satisfied. One of my favorite movies of all time showing the rigors of the soldiers of the greatest generation.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I am enjoying this game as a good  &quot;Hulk...Smash!&quot; type of game.  If it gets more mentally challenging down the road, I'll change my review...until then, &quot;Warrior crush demon&quot;.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen Firefly the series, but I read all the glowing Amazon reviews and decided to give it a try.<br />I wish to publicly thank you all for not leading me astray. It's a gem of great story telling and wonderful character development. Really evil enemies and villains (especially the Reavers) to avoid or overcome. Neat special effects to please the eye. Plus plenty of extras. Who could ask for anything more?
0316228532|5.0|Good for JK to branch out and do something different. While I still wish she would return to the Potter series at some point it is still great to have new stuff from her. The book had a real eerie feel to it. Small town secrets always make for a good story.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|After its initial, and critically-savaged, release in 1951, \\"Alice\\" languished in the Disney vaults for more than 20 years, until the late-60s craze for all things psychedelic, renewed interest in \\"Alice\\" and made it a cult-favorite for college rentals. Finally re-released to theaters in the early 70s, I saw it 5 times as a Tween. In contrast to today's glut of animated fare, back then \\"Alice\\" was like water in the desert.<br /><br />What kept me coming back? it wasn't the craziness of all the characters Alice meets -- the \\"draw\\" was the animation of Alice herself, so beautifully and gracefully done. Many years later I found out how the animators (Disney's legendary \\"nine old men\\") did it: They made a live-action film first, to use as a reference.<br /><br />Like me at that time, Alice dreams of a \\"world of my own,\\" an escape from her boring life of dreary, colorless schoolbooks with no pictures. But in the grand old tradition of \\"be careful what you wish for,\\" once she gets what she wants, she finds that a wonder-world where \\"everything is nonsense\\" is peopled with zanies who range from unbearably frustrating to downright nasty. Ever notice that the nicest character in the film is the doorknob?<br /><br />Storywise, the film isn't much. Alice's Adventures are episodic and disjointed; she goes from one encounter to the next, and there doesn't seem to be any real point to the story except the aforementioned \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, Alice undergoes no great transformation or dream-come-true -- she goes back to her dreadfully dull life, presumably still the same girl she was at the beginning. (\\"That's it? Seriously?\\")<br /><br />That said, the film is still a visual feast, abounding in sight gags both large and small. Largest is the positively brilliant \\"March of the Cards.\\" But don't overlook the funny species of birds Alice runs into, when she's lost in the woods -- nor the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when the Dodo picks upan entire campfire in his bare wings.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Alice\\" has more songs than most Disney films -- too bad most of them are mere snippets! I wish \\"Jabberwocky\\" and the sensual \\"A-E-I-O-U\\" could have had longer arrangements. But the lush \\"Golden Afternoon\\" is the envy of any Sweet-Adelines chorus. And did you ever notice that everything the Queen of Hearts says, is punctuated by a brass section? Sometimes I wish I could turn the vocals off and just study the orchestrations!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Fairly easy to read, and for a non-professional writer, Mark Owen gives a straight forward account of the operation.  If you want to know what happened that night, this appears to be an unvarnished first person account.  Unfortunately, the author paints himself in such a one-dimensional manner, i.e. all I ever wanted to be was GI JOE/SEAL from age nine, etc. got to be a much.  If that's really true, then I almost feel sorry for him now he's done with everything he's ever wanted to do and be.<br /><br />It's a shame he didn't get some help writing this from the author of Outlaw Platoon, who writes about himself and his team in a much more compelling way.
B007QRWXJG|1.0|I bought this on instant video.  Went to watch episode 3 and could not get the video to play for 30 minutes.  Called customer service who told me in order to watch the videos I need to regularly clean out my flash cache and check and see if someone else on my wi-fi connection is using up too much bandwidth.  Nothing else on the internet, including Youtube and Netflix, is causing me any kind of speed or streaming problems.  I am using a brand new MacBook Pro and have highs speed wi-fi.  What a pain in the ass.  This is supposed to be Instant Video, not High-Maintenance video.  I don't care what the difference is between the way Amazon and Netflix codes their videos, if you advertise Instant Video you better keep up with the times and make it work no matter what.  The chick then refunded my money but took away the videos from my video player!  So now I can't even try again tomorrow.  So, I'm done with Amazon Instant Video.
B004KKXMSI|1.0|Great price, but its foreign...and all 3 discs skipped and froze up. I do NOT recomend. Do not buy this product. No no.no
0061544493|3.0|i am a fan of victoria, so i ended up buying this book. the book had lots of great photos and some nice tips, but many where just not for the everyday person. a lot of things she talked about were too expensive to actually buy, from jeans to dresses to candles. it was a fairly good read though, with great photos. each subject was broken down well, bit some parts got a bit boring/repetitive. for shorter sections, i didn't think that a recap of where to buy was needed like in the longer sections...but that's just how i felt. overall it was a fun and campy look into mrs. beckham's beauty routines and shopping habits.
0545128285|5.0|Loved every short story in the book. Reminded me of being read Hansel and Gretel as a child. Wonderful. Still hoping for JK to return with more Potter books.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I hear this is a fun game as well,  but it won't install on my Motorola Triumph. $2.99 wasted. Hoping this gets fixed.
B0094OLFUW|1.0|Just as other reviewers mentioned this album is incredibly repetitive and monotone. The album doesn't have the spark of the others.
1476712042|5.0|The best book I have read in a while! Jamie McGuire really makes you want to believe in love. Travis and Abby are made for each other.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and if you have a good idea u better get the app!!! You should get this app!!!
B004INNRFK|5.0|It was one of the best concerts I have watched indeed. The image and sound quality are outstanding. I'm never tired to watch again and again. I loved it!!!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|awesome game for u guys out there who love zombie related killing games I swear guys good graphics fun and also freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game as well as the younger ones .. we will sit for about an hour playing this game... it doesn't do much but watching the coins fall and working to earn the prizes and mini games is great! some people say its dumb but it teaches patience* a good thing to learn when you're younger. I hope you take this into consiteration before you go making comments that put the makers and others down. some people like it and some should get a chance to try it. have fun!!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary is a very good one and includes many interesting words.  My most liked word is, well I don't know because I never actually read it... but you should... I guess.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|DC has spoiled me since BTAS, Justice League and their other dvd releases. I never read this comic and almost passed this cartoon up. Masterful from the beginning to the end and had me on the edge of my seat. Can not wait for part 2. Officially my favorite Batman rendition to date. Thanks D.C.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Passes the time. Just don't expect me to pay actual money for coins when I don't actually win coins.  Earning 1 coin every 30 seconds makes for a long wait time in between playing.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I think this is a fun game it can be a bit difficult but its completely solveable. I don't recommend it to the easily frustrated
B005LAJ16I|3.0|I've never seen such UN-user friendly DVDs! Ultimatley my husband figured out how to crudely  navigate from one episode to the next and it was worth it but WTH?
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I like this game.  I figured it out put by accident but I'll share. You have to connect every dot to another but they don't have to start and end the same color. For level six connect the reds then make a yellow turn orange and end orange.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I purchased the game for my Fire,  and it wont install. Ive tried 2*. It says &quot;Downloading&quot; but never finishes.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|Having somehow missed this work of Dickens thus far, I am glad that I had such a satisfactory introduction to it.  The surprise throughout was the expert contrast between truly good people and craftily evil villains. The French protagonist was so good I often thought myself back on the steets of modern-day Paris or in Le Havre dealing with one of today's Frenchmen who enjoy a cetain bon-vie-vaunt reputation for rudeness.  The incredibly detailed instrospection of social status influincing life from so many viewpoints coupled with an interesting plot and admirable characters whom you can't help but empathize with, make Little Dorit time well spent for anyone who is not suffering from atrophy of the soul.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|this movie was beyond my expecations,the story line was great and you had to follow the story very closley to get it,i had to watch the movie over to catch all i had missed the first time
B002ZG976U|5.0|This item was purchased from<br />Amazon.com. This  is an excellent movie  I definitely  it. It's about the ambition<br />of a young lady who works her way to fame and knows at the end what's important<br /><br />Don't want to ruin the end!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was nothing like I expected....I was dragging my heals about reading it....once I did - it was wonderful and naughty.  The greatest thing I loved was the story line.  It kept you on the edge of your seat.  I didn't want to put the book down!  I work two jobs and one of them fulltime and I still managed to read all three books in three weeks...that is how good they were.  The only sad thing was when I was finished with the third book, I wanted the story to continue.  I can't wait to read Fifty Shades from Christian's point of view.  Awesome, awesome books!!  Love it - it fulfills a woman's fantasy...wish I had my own Christian Grey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book and recommend it to everyone I know. It was such a great book for discussing also. The story is great and I loved how the author ended all the books and picked right up with the next one. Hope whoever reads this review it helps them to read this series.
0440237688|1.0|With all the great literature that is available for middle schoolers, it is mind boggling that The Giver, a mediocre yet sensationalist book, keeps getting assigned for fifth graders. Suppression of puberty, commercialized breeding and other features of the story are, I hope, beyond the realm of understanding for 10 year olds. There are plenty of great dystopian novels out there to read for older students, but this is certainly not one of them. To all you teachers who are simply following the pack on this front, look into some other options and teach Orwell, Swift and the like when students are ready.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|Perfect for both kids and adults, Pigment by One Lives Left is a challenging, addictive new puzzle game.  Will you finish every level?  Download Pigment through Amazon or Play Store today!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an avid reader of science fiction and got this series on a whim. This is the best series I have read in a long time, and may be the best I have ever read.  I literally could not put it down, because it just kept getting better and better. If you are looking for a good book, this is it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|what a great game. so addicting. love it<br />I'm very glad that I decided to download it on my kindle
B007PTJOV0|4.0|lep's wprld is a irish verison of mario apart from collecting accorns and pots of gold. lep's world is a fun game with good graphics.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A must read for any American patriot.  A tremendous opportunity to learn more about the Navy SEALS and their commitment to theiry country.
B008XG1X18|5.0|is extremely informative and so addicting! !! definitely one of the best sites. I now have all four daugthers and one granddaughter hooked on the site.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|use this to fall asleep, relax and when I get a massage.  spool much better than those expensive sound machines
030758836X|4.0|This was purchased for my wife and she loved it.  Our daughter-law also has already enjoyed it.  It arrived on time and in like-new condition.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I like the look of the app but it's not very accurate for times left for talk,  browsing, etc. on my Galaxy Nexus.
B001JRB16U|4.0|This DVD set arrived quickly, and upon review, proved to be a most fine rendition of this 40-year-old film! I will watch this perdiodically, and enjoy it over and over again for a long time to come!  Thank you!
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey I had heard about this book which was similar in the respect of it being a story of love. However the similarity is there Bared to you is a completely different read. For one while reading Bared to you, the flow of the story is natural. The book also progresses quickly and is NOT as repetitive as some other reads. I finished this book in about 24 hours. Very good read and I cannot wait for the next book!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome.  I hope more books come out or a series starts.   I need to read the months/years that were skipped
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a wonderful and enlightening book.  It was easy reading with the fine points presently clearly and concise.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is mindless relaxation.  It keeps you engaged by giving cool &quot;prizes&quot;.  Fun on the Kindle, the screen is so big.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I saw the movie first, then read the book, so I did it the wrong way, according to my teachers from when I was a kid. In any case, I thought the book was very good. It obviously goes into more detail than the movie does, especially the background and history of sabermetrics and how people (ex. Bill James) began to analyze baseball statistics differently in the late 1970's and early 80's. I really enjoyed the parts of the book where Oakland GM Billy Beane is wheeling and dealing with other GMs in MLB to acquire players he thinks that will not only help his team succeed, but also ones that he thinks are undervalued by the rest of the league. Also, I think Lewis makes a great point at the end of the book about how the older, entrenched executives and scouts (and old press as well) in MLB dismissed Beane's idea of \\"Moneyball\\" and about looking at building a baseball team a different way because this new line of thinking threatened their existence in MLB. He refers to these old timers as \\"The Club\\" and says the worst thing a member of The Club can do is be disloyal. MLB could use a fresh set of ideas, especially for teams who just can't spend money like the Yankees, Dodgers, Angels, etc.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book. A lot of romance novels seem to be about the male being dominant. This was a nice change of pace. The women in this novel are pretty straight forward and dont take much crap. Very sweet story. I hope they plan on continuing the story. I would love to see the characters development out of college and into life.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|We are addicted to Bones, but hadn't seen season 7. It was wonderful to get the entire season at such a low price. We are able to watch all of our favorite shows from our Amazon's video library through our PS3. We haven't finished watching the entire season, but we're really enjoying Bones and Booth as a couple this season.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|yes it bugs me that they charged another buck halfway it....seems unethical really, but their graphics are always amazing, the storyline spooky, and hours of entertainment!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Something I definitely need. I like that you can customize it by changing the color. Would like to see battery status when I first turn on my Kindle Fire versus having to go to the app.
B007549W62|2.0|And I am now sorry that I did because in many respects it was and is horrible and I won't likely be renting it again, I cannot understand for the life of me why the actress Rosanna Arquette would want to portray herself in the matters and manners as this only to be killed by those two creep brothers that she did in this film even of she is acting, maybe she's wasked up as an actress now or this film will do it to her. I agree with the synopsis in the trailers that this is a film that is relentless in parts and does not give up but the violence is overwroght. And they did not explain what the people in the hazmat suits were doing with the bodies of the children that were in the cryogenic chambers after they took the daughter of the character being played by Arquette. It's like a claustrophobic type movie.
B002SRQ214|5.0|The processor worked great right out of the box. Still quick enough to practically do anything I want. Stays pretty cool as well.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this game on my kindle &amp; Android. My mother has it on her iPad as well. wonderful hidden object game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun to challenge myself against time. i can beat my son at this game not an easy task he is great at most games!
B009IJJ8UM|4.0|Going into the show with never having heard of it I wasn't sure what to expect.  The three 1 Star reviews initially had me worried, but the episode was free so I figured why not.<br />What I wound up getting was a very entertaining 45 minutes.<br />Not wanting to ruin the episode I will not into the specifics, but just know that the show is a modern U.S. interpretation of Sherlock Holmes set in New York City.<br />While  Johnny Lee Miller (person who plays Sherlock Holmes) doesn't have the charm of Robert Downy Jr., he pulls off a good Holmes.<br />If you liked the movie at all and ever wondered how it would be in present day New York, look no further.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|These cases are not real go to bestbuy and compare cases and you will see there is a big difference
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book that tells the story without glitz and glamour. You feel as though you are walking with these heros during one of the greatest missions that has ever been executed.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|Quick learning curve, but pay attention to what colors turn into on the board. Takes some trial &amp; error, but unlimited undo's by hitting the back button on your device. I am playing on a tablet (VS g-tablet) and it is full screen and no problems! Great faotd Amazon!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved how complicated Eva and Gideon's relationship is. It was definitely a page turner.....I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next book!!
B007I9JGSS|5.0|It's amazing how beautiful this music is. I actually have never \\"gotten into\\" the sitar until now. I've not minded it before, but I never really got into it. This is the first album that's actually completely left me speechless when it comes to the sitar ... and the collaboration with other styles here is so breathtaking. One reviewer was saying that the collaborations felt contrived and she could not get into it, saying it felt \\"forced\\" or like she was trying too hard to invent a new genre. I have the opposite experience. These songs feel so organic, and compelling ... She is definitely channeling something amazing here. Highly highly recommended.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I brought this case a few days ago and as soon as I opened it and put my phone in it it cracked at the top so then I thought this is odd, so I went to best buy and purchased the real life proof case and compared it and omg you can tell a big difference in the case i orded. You can see the glue on the inside the grey was lighter than the real one the screen cover wasn't really secure in there it's just a mess. SO DO NOT BUY THIS OFF AMAZON THEY ARE KNOCK OFFS !!!!!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I love the resident evil series, specially RE 2 and 4. And I truly love this Blu Ray movie. The best Resident Evil movie I've seen so far. There are so many awesome moments and elements from all resident evil games (1-5). I recommend this movie to everyone. And if you are a RE fan, what are you waiting for? Buy it now. 5 Stars !!!!  Hopefully they make another movie :D
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I recently decided to read the Bible.  I don't know much about it and thought it was time to start.  I like the idea of this being an application in addition to being a book because it allows for the addition of extra features and options.  For example, I started with the KJV but after a few  hours I realized I was struggling too hard to read and comprehend it. I was able to easily switch to NKJV.  It's like getting the second book for free.  I also like the feature that gently prompts me to start reading again if I've been away for a few days.  The variety of books and the ease of purchasing them on my Kindle Fire presents too many distractions.  :)  The reminder is helpful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this app 2 nights ago and I can't put it down!! It's soo fun. If you like challenges, you'll love this game!
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I really enjoy the &quot;router&quot; games so I'm sure  I'll have similar enjoyment with this game since it gives the added challenge of mixing colors.<br /><br />I am giving high marks to the dev who not only acknowledged the problems that showed up while this was a FAOTD but addressed reviewers personally in his/her review. wish more apps had devs like that.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching.  I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend.  She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily.  I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar.  Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon.  Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building.  There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building.  What could possibly go wrong?
B0056BMK6K|3.0|Okay so some people are flaming over the paid review thing, but in my opinion if you are a newbie to the many Internet tools that now exist for promoting your creative work this book isn't a bad place to learn some effective strategies, especially for authors.  I have been blogging since 2005 and I guess I was from the old school that thought 'hey if I put something on the Internet then a million people will see it.'  Wrong!  Nobody sees what you put on a web page unless you figure out some way of telling them to go look at it.  John Locke gives some really cool tips and examples for using Twitter and blogging together to send traffic to your book page, whether it's on Amazon or anywhere else.  I tried these tips and they actually work.  I can tell by monitoring traffic stats on my blog.  If you're already an expert on this stuff then you probably need more advanced information. But if you are beginning your journey of trying to figure this out then this book is worth a look. Good luck!
B004FHCH96|1.0|I got this movie because I watched Bollywood version of it called \\"Gajini\\". This was done 6 years after memento. Memento was a total dissapointment after watching Gajini, the Bollywood version is brilliant. It's a waste if time watching Memento.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!  it is great for mobile devices, especially my kindle fire.  very easy to view &amp; pin
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very handy and never be unexpected when battery is low. Lets me know amount a tome for reading, games, movies, etc.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|No instructions, puh-leeze! Use your mind, peoples! 6 was cake! Does nobody remember 4th grade science??<br />This is a new twist on an already awesomely addictive game!<br />Connect all like-colored dots. Simple enough, right?<br />Wrong!! What if there's only one dot of one color?? Then you find *another* dot of a *different* color! By dragging the path from *one* uniquely colored dot *ACROSS* the path of Another already-connected pair, you create a (gasp!) *NEW COLOR*!!<br />Ta-daaaa!!!<br />Simple.
1401216676|5.0|It is a very good and a must own for the batman graphic novels. It is a tragic tale of jokers orgin. the only down side is its kind of short i have read the book in about an hour ,the artwork was great and is a good book that all fans should enjoy.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I had the honor of attending Lindsey's first show on her first tour last weekend, but I was already a fan before that. Her YouTube Zelda Medley was my first introduction to this incredible artist, and everything I have heard or seen from her since then has only increased my appreciation of her talents. She combines violin with high-powered synth and drum beats to create a very unique style. I bought this CD at her show, and have listened to it every day since. Track 5 (Moon Trance) is amazing. Most often, I find 3 or even 4 songs on a given CD that I like. In my opinion, every track on this CD is a hit.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved the movie--satisfying balance of humor and action without taking itself too seriously--but you're either going to love this movie or hate it. It is what it is.<br /><br />So let me instead praise the on-demand streaming video quality: the audio was pleasantly leveled, so I didn't have to turn it down in the loud parts and crank it up for the dialogue. And the shadow detail is very good: the dark scenes of Loki conspiring were much more...visible in this stream than in the streaming version of 2011 \\"Thor\\" from other [paid] sources. Good job, Amazon!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|The pirate adventure tale written in the language of the time. This book is a perfect escape for those who enjoy stories of bucaneers and buried treasure.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love being able to find recipes and inspiring ideas to try out..but this app &quot;force closes&quot; and crashes a lot and then I lose the recipe I found before saving it and cant find it again
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game is really addicting.I like running over muntants.Everything is amazing.I didn't have any bugs or glitches either.Just amazing.Also it kills time and when you are bored and you play this it will wash away the boredness.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love that you can make a simple text list or a checklist. I use it for shopping lists, reminders, book/website lists, etc. I travel frequently for work, and having a packing checklist I can reuse is awesome.
B0072OFM28|5.0|FINALLY!  Yeah, I was one of those people who didn't have `STARZ' but DID have Netflix.  Unfortunately Netflix was being stupid (or maybe it was STARZ) but for whatever reason, I was unable to stream this \\"season\\" of `Spartacus'.  I had to suffer (first world suffering mind you, but still suffering) through all the FaceBook and Twitter updates from my friends and the cast members of `Spartacus'.  I did well in avoiding it but it was hard, hard, hard.  I didn't line up at midnight to get this DVD boxed set, but I was one of the first.<br /><br />Was it worth the wait?  Yes!  Was I disappointed that there were only ten episodes?  Hell yes!  I don't follow `Spartacus' enough to know why there are only ten episodes, but finding that out was a bit of a disappointment.  Despite this meager offering, the ten episodes are VERY good!  And I do mean very, very, very good!  There is plenty of blood, sex, drama, fighting, death, gore, skin, and intersecting story lines to keep you hooked for the ten episodes.  I tried my best to space it out but I gave up after episode 2.  I ran through those DVD's like a gladius through soggy intestine.  The new Navia was a treat for the eyes and Ilithya is just... damn... hell hath no fury as Ilithya scorned!<br /><br />I know people are obsessed with the blood, sex, and tears this show is known for but what keeps me glued is the story.  (OK, OK, seeing a bare chested Mira and Naevia doesn't hurt) So many twists, so many turns, so many things you don't see coming.  Our favorite characters are back and they are bathed in blood, booty, and unbreakable bonds.  Do yourself a favor and pick one weekend to watch this DVD.  Get it out the way... so you can watch it again.<br /><br />In some strange twist of fate I was reading `Spartacus: Rebellion' by Ben Kane at the same time I was viewing this DVD.  So like a female pleasure slave, I was getting it from both ends.  It was very interesting to see the differences between the two.  Since there is very little literature/written history on Spartacus there is a lot of room to \\"fill in\\" and embellish on the true myth that is the man.  I laugh at the idiots who actually take time to form an argument about how this series isn't accurate.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?  This is entertainment!  Pure and simple!!<br /><br />I truly enjoyed every episode in this DVD but my favorites were #5 and #10.  Matter of fact I shouted on very loud s-bomb in the middle of #5 that pretty much woke up the house.  Episode #10 I must have watched the last fifteen minutes five or six times.  Not joking.  All in all this was a very good DVD, but at only ten episodes calling this a season is a joke.  I hope the cast and crew are given more time to really bring it home with `Spartacus: War of the Damned'.y little literature/written history on Spartacus there is a lot of room to \\"fill in\\" and embellish on the true myth that is the man.

B005LAIHCM|4.0|I saw the screening for the film in early February. The studio told the fans to not discuss the movie (obviously so people wouldn't reveal the spoilers, and in case of any bad publicity).<br /><br />Well either way, I found the movie to be very good. Almost reminded me of the exploitation flicks from the 70s and 80s starting with the title \\"House on the end of the street\\". The movie comes complete with a great twist that as well  reminded me of a specific flick from the 80s (Sleep**** **** see if you can figure it out).<br /><br />Plot: Setup is pretty simple. Mother and daughter Elissa and Sarah (Elizabeth Shue, Jennifer Lawrence) move to a new place. Daughter develops feelings for the boy next door Ryan (Max Thieriot). The boy allegedly has a crazy sitter that might of murdered her parents. Elissa gets together with Ryan unaware of the danger she faces, and unaware that both Ryan and Carrie Ann<br /><br />The acting was very good. Obviously a good cast here: Elizabeth Shue, Jennifer Lawrence, Gil Bellows, Max Thieriot.<br /><br />The movie gets you thinking that things will turn out one away, but ends up ending another way. I thought the twist they came up was very good, and it was set up very well that no one saw it coming. So many movies claim that in their trailer, but this is one actual flock with an ending that most people didn't see coming.<br /><br />The soundtrack was good too. Pretty much it establish the dark atmosphere and that things will take a turn for the worse in many scenes.<br /><br />I got the benefit of an early screening, but I would definitely recommend it along with the along users who have seen it.
B00979OL5A|1.0|Save your time, this game is no good! It offers no help on how to play and you get no help figuring it out
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Somebody wrote \\"if this would have been Lee Child's first Reacher book, I would never have bought another one\\". I could not agree with him more. After having read a first few chapters, I was really looking forward to this new book. But oh my, after those few chapters it got boring, absolutely making no sense at some points. If Mr. Child is thinking about retiring Jack Reacher, I do hope he comes up with a better ending than this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the first book I read by Gillian Flynn, and I will be reading her others. She's the real deal! It's so refreshing to find a truly talented writer who tells a great story. Really suspenseful, full of twists; a highly original psychological thriller. Good luck tearing yourself away from this one.
0486274268|5.0|I thought this might be a good resource. Wow! This is an incredible resource! So glad that I ordered this!
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|was a great game on my kindle fire until I got to the lonely house and now it wont let me go back to backyard i uninstalled and reinstalled and still same thing BIG FISH GAME PLEASE FIX
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is a waste of money,time,and well creation!  the people that made this can do way better I vote for block story!!!!!!!  :.)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Compelling narrative, good character development, excellent perspective from the protagonists POV.  Dystopian fiction doesn't get much better than this, really.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have never played this kind of game before so it is new to me. I play it on my kindle fire as does my six year old and we both enjoy it a lot. lots of fun for the whole family.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I found no less than 14 almost identical characteristics between Puller and Child's Reacher, not the least of which were height, weight, parentage, head butting, one brother, coffee fixation, clock in the head, desert storm wounds, lone wolf, army background, and the brilliant deductive reasonings.  That said, I can't wait for the next one.  It was good.
B001O3B5BK|5.0|Even though Tommy has been over-played throughout the years on the radio, especially \\"Pinball Wizard\\", I still enjoy the music and the nostalgic feeling that it invokes when I play it in its entirety. Certainly a classic album, and a must Who album to own! Decent job done on \\"Remastering\\"!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very fun. at first I thought that this would be a boring game but I am glad that I bought it...it is challenging and requires your full concentration when trying to beat someone's score.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved this movie. Finally there is a movie about the struggles and love of a mother and child. It's my favorite Disney movie ever! It was full of adventure and love. When a mother child relationship is the most important in ones life, why are there not more films about it?
B005NFW1JK|5.0|Great quality and great show! I would have liked for the episodes to be cheaper, ended up buying all of them and it wasn't as affordable.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A fascinating story that was able to keep my attention while it was being serialized. Funny, suspenseful, with a very particular attention to detail. Very science-oriented, although being a layman, I can't say that it's 100% accurate. But it was certainly a fun ride.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|This is a neat little puzzle game. If you aren't afraid to get the &quot;wrong&quot; answer, it is fairly simple to figure out. You just need to try it from a &quot;what if I do this&quot; perspective. I can't wait to see what my 5 year old makes of this game.
B000KX0IOA|3.0|Gandhi is a biographical film based on the courageous and influential life of Mohandas Gandhi. Gandhi was a patient and nonviolent peacemaker filled with tolerance and love. After getting kicked off a South African train despite having a first class ticket, he became aware of how Indians were being treated. It was then when he decided to start a peacemaking movement to protect Indian rights and stop the hatred. He wanted to fight against the anger and not provoke it. Gandhi was arrested on multiple occasions, but eventually made his point known to the government. After being released from prison, he returned to India to continue his campaign. However, things took a turn for the worse. Violence broke out during the protest, which led to a devastating massacre. The British army shot and killed hundreds of Indian protesters, including women and children. Indians later fought back in a riot, brutally killing a British policeman.<br /> Gandhi believed that in order to gain independence they must prove worthy of it, and that there must always be Hindu/Muslim unity. They defied the British and burned all of their British factory made clothes. After World War ll, Indian independence was finally granted. However, tensions between Hindus and Muslims rose and nevertheless led to violent outbreaks. Displeased, Gandhi decided to fast until the Indians stopped their hatred and violence. As Gandhi became ill, the Indians decided to stop the fighting. Their solution was to have all Muslims live in their own separate country. Gandhi did not like this idea of religious separation and was determined to unite the two nations. Once again he decided to fast, and would not stop until he believed the fighting would not start again.<br /> During his final fast, Gandhi became extremely weak and ill. He was encouraged to end his fast, reassured that there would be peace. He was taken out for a walk with a crowd full of people to greet him. It was then that he was shot and killed by Nathuram Godse.

Thank you for the many hours of relaxation and escape from when times get hard in real life. A masterpiece from a master of art in writing fiction/fantasy.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|its obvious the creators took their time and effort to create near perfection with this app.  as far as bibles are concerned this is the only app u need. the only recommendation I have is that a commentary be added such as Mathew Henry's Bible Commentary.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|VERY slow starting read. Was ready to put the book down, and leave it down. Then it picked up, and went over the top. Book two Fifty shades Darker was nothing more then a average read, very poor writting towards the end. Book three in the Trilogy was nothing more then a money maker for the author. Read it just to finish the trilogy. I would not run out to pick up another book by this author.
B009GENZ12|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  I can't believe how few reviews there are and how negative they are.  This is not the B horror flick you're expecting.  For most of the movie you will not know what the F is going on, which I love because I am so sick of movies that I know what's going to happen within the first 30 minutes.  There is mystery, suspense, twists and turns, and most importantly there is a question which the movie poses......that goes unanswered.  I love this movie.  I was so pleasantly surprised with it and I hope others will watch and appreciate it as well!
0297859390|5.0|Very well written book.  I bought the book to read on a travel day.<br />I was so engrossed in the book that I nearly missed my boarding call.<br /><br />The only bad thing is I work with a woman like Amy and it has left me wondering just what lengths she will go to.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely riveting - I thought the series was just going to be adult porn, but the books actually have a great story line - they show how a dysfunctional upbringing can affect your entrire life, but they also let us see how real love,affection and respect for others can replace a lot of bad memories with \\"firsts\\" that will change the course of a life - it helps that you are drop dead handsome & filthy rich!! \\"Laters, Baby!\\"
B003H9MSPG|2.0|This gun looks awesome, like a cool sniper, it just looks like a beast, which is why i got this gun. One thing off the bat,this gun SUCKS BUTT to shoot. It will go 20-30 feet in stock form and its just pitiful to shoot it. It has lousy accurcy and a slow rate of fire. I modded this gun to shoot around 35-40 feet now, but it stinks becasue the priming now has issues. If you plan to mod this gun, then it will be of a good educational value to you. Bottom line is get this gun because it looks like a boss, but there's no chance of becoming a boss if you use this gun.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its fun. ive played games like this at the carnival. I like to see what I can win. you should try it. I did
B0099G3I96|1.0|this album, like their first single (settle down), is god awful. gwen, no one can understand what you're singing. \\"settle down\\" is like a pop inspired nursery rhyme. is she singing about bath time? a rub a dub...a rub a dub!<br /><br />you do much better spelling bananas. seriously, it's kind of weird to watch a 40 yr old woman dance like a 19 yr old raver. at least reinvent your sound with david guetta or someone making huge waves now.
0345803507|2.0|Since I've had so many of my friends and co-workers raving about this trilogy I endured all 3 books! Needless to say I hope the movie idea is scrapped.  The whining became nauseating, the booked jumped from storyline to storyline, it was easy to guess what was going to happen next, the emails were annoying (we send texts nowadays), and the so called erotic passages were tame in comparison to the definition of eroticism.  Overall the greatest cringe factor was the lack of adjectives.  Oh my!  How many different words can be substituted for palatable, salacious, bemused, passively, petulant, and sardonic to name a few.  It sounded like a child using bigger words for practice or to sound more educated.  I found myself rolling my eyes in exasperated annoyance (PUN INTENDED).  All 3 books could be condensed into 1 if the rambling is eliminated.  Get it from the library if you must read it.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This gun is argubly one of my favorite guns of ALL TIME IN my nerf gun collection.I was a little hesitant when deciding wether or not to buy this gun do to its price, but it is 100% worth the money hands down. This gun for me shoots really far, and the 75ft claims are 100%true, it is one my favorite guns, the others being the vilgilon and the nitron. It shoots fast, and can hold up to 144 darts. If you are looking for a good nerf blaster in genral, i will highly reccomend this, you wont be dissappointed.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|I finished reading this book last month. Overall the war situation in this book is described very well, as disturbing as it is. The beginning was touching when Ishmael was with his family and his brother Junior. It broke my heart when he and Junior separated. The story became slow when he was wondering around aimlessly and a bit repetitive when he was recruited as a soldier as the killing seemed to go on and on. War is terrible and there is no easy way to write about it. However, I was disturbed by how much the characters seemed to enjoy the killing. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of storytelling that came out in the end. The rehabilitation process was so moving, and we finally started to see a glimpse of the young boy we had met earlier in the book.
B007HJ84ZK|4.0|The cinematography is excellent and the story is amazing.  No cleaning things up to make it look romantic, this looks real.  As usual, Sean Bean is outstanding.  This is following the book very closely and I can hardly wait to see the rest of Season 1.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|Aside from the pretty visuals and the occasional good moment from Chris Hemsworth this movie was terrible.  The story and plot were weak at best and full of holes.  Lots of bad choices as well that seemed to happen because it would look cool but added nothing.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Don't be fooled by the fluffy beginnings of this season.  Gets good and bloody just the way we love it!
0316228532|1.0|She should stick to Harry Potter type books<br />I'm such a huge fan, was really looking forward to this and when I got it was so horrible...not even going to finish it.  Made it through 25% and that was more than enough for me
0984183523|5.0|Before reading Victor's book, I went through a couple other \\"classic\\" books but still found case interview as a black box. After the first visit to his website, I bought his book immediately on Amazon. Victor's way of disclosing consulting and case interview was like a lightning flash. After reading three days reading the whole book, the only question I have is \\"How come no one ever understand case interview like Victor did?\\" His simple framework, precise explanation of the each step, and insightful suggestions are all super helpful.<br /><br />I bet in two or three years, Victor's book will be the \\"BIBLE\\" in case interview preparation world.

B0000524E5|3.0|The package came sooner than expected and I was happy to get it then :)<br />However...<br />The movie was pretty scratched, it was so disappointing :( not just a little scratched, I couldn't really enjoy it and it's one of my favorite movies
B008RV5K5E|3.0|I know that this is one of the most esteemed graphic novels of all time and it would be nearly impossible to<br />successfully adapt this Frank Miller classic to animated story.  That being said, since it still bears the name<br />\\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", there's still going to be a myriad of comparisons to the printed version of the graphic<br />novel.  Long story short, this feature doesn't hold up.  The gritty, dark, brooding, and out-right shocking work of Miller<br />is replaced with the clean, edited, & tamed work of the DC animation studio.  Sure, it's cool to see some of my favorite scenes<br />from the novel played out with moving characters, but ultimately this Dark Knight pulls too many punches for my liking.<br />Several of the major sticking points for me were... First, taking a very \\"R\\" rated comic, if not THE R rated comic that set the tone for<br />all others to follow, and turning it into a \\"PG\\" romp.  All the changes that had to be made to the plot & story to accommodate this<br />were just too much for me to stomach.  Second, what made the graphic novel so great, at least in my opinion, was the narration provided<br />by Bruce Wayne/Batman throughout the story.  It's something no other Batman story has ever properly done before or after...in Miller's comic<br />Bruce Wayne, Batman, & the Bruce/Batman narration where like 3 separate characters. Taking out the inner dialog from Batman takes a thrilling<br />scene like Batman's fight with Two Face and turns it into a dull punch-up that doesn't come close to capturing the power of what Miller was<br />able to conjure. Third & final, why adapt this novel to leave out major plot points?  No Superman references at all here...Unless the second installment is almost 2 hours in length, then a lot of Miller's original story is going to be left out.  I usually enjoy watching the comics that<br />DC's animation department adapt, but with this feature as well as Batman's \\"Year One\\", another Miller adaptation,I think it'd be best for<br />DC to look to other Dark Knight stories for inspiration and leave the Miller canon alone.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|Dear All,<br /><br />I am a great fan of this show not just for its clear entertainment value, but also for the excellence of the scripts. The writing team clearly planned things out well, and to me it was a bit unusual in that it very skilfully combined humour, slapstick, intelligence, the vagaries and vicissitudes of relationships, and drama in a credible, incredible and seamless narrative which flowed with an undercurrent of intelligence, compassion, passion and caring. The whole was certainly greater than the sum of the parts in the ensemble nature of the emergence of the arc of this show, in the sense that any decision or feeling of a sufficiently large group (such as this) is usually wiser, more compassionate and more useful than that of even the most intelligent, wise and or compassionate member of that group. I found it very instructive in living life in the relative with common sense (generally speaking), albeit with an American slant (I am an Aussie).<br /><br /> As with some others in this thread, I did not start watching the show until its later seasons, but warmed to it quite quickly through the reruns here in Australia that run in as much sequence as an Avogadro number of Brownian motions (sorry about that - I am also a great fan of The Big Bang Theory and studied a little Physics as part of Aero Eng). So, I have been inspired to get a full set of all the seasons preferably in as high a high def I can get.<br /><br />So, when I saw it was coming out on BluRay and it would probably be cheaper with the high Aussie to buy it from the USA than to buy it here (no sales tax/GST for stuff imported under $1000), I looked forward to order this set, as it would be in a format clearly better than the reruns here, which are a bit pixellated.<br /><br />However, THEN I read the reviews advising that the DVD \\"director's cut\\" (essentially) DVD version with the extra dialogue and takes were not going to be brought out on BluRay - only the original heavily edited original broadcasts.<br /><br />The BluRay creator excuses for this, viz -<br /><br />\\"According to TVShowsOnDVD, \\"The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.\\" \\"<br />Peter Butler     4 reviewers made a similar statement\\"<br /><br />and -<br /><br />\\" Warner Home Video's reason for this is as follows: \\"The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.\\"\\"<br /><br />are clearly a lot of dweeby dweebdust bulldust. Why? Because, as you will see from this link re the technical production values for the Friends show at the respected IMDb site lynk wwwDimdbDcomStitleStt0108778Stechnical (where D is a period/fullstop and S is a forward stroke), you will find the following data re what the shows were shot on and with (also seen in the credits at the end of each show) -<br /><br />Technical specifications for<br />\\"Friends\\" (1994)<br /><br />Camera<br />Panaflex Camera and Lenses by Panavision<br /><br />Laboratory<br />FotoKem Laboratory, Burbank (CA), USA<br /><br />Film negative format (mm/video inches)<br />35 mm<br /><br />Aspect ratio<br />1.78 : 1 (remastered version) (this is 16/9 - ie 16:9 widescreen = 1.77 recurring)<br />1.33 : 1  (this is the original 4:3 TV non-widescreen format at the time of broadcasts, at least early in the series)<br /><br />I bet with a show of this calibre, they would have the original master and sub-master prints of the 35 mm film of each episode kept under Fort Knox type security and would be of pristine quality. Note that as an aside, they used major feature film quality gear in the form of Panavision cameras and lenses and 35mm film (note that HD digital technology was just starting to become acceptable for high end stuff just as the final season of Friends came to an end in May 2004, so I guess they only had film as the only option to create and preserve quality, especially in view of advertisers paying $2million for a 30 second ad in the final show).<br /><br />The main point I am making is that they have ALL the original footage in high def 35mm film shot on Panavision cameras. Clearly it is high def enough to bring out the truncated BluRay version they will be releasing in November. Because they have ALL this original footage, including outtakes and bloopers and all the original footage put into the DVD version, and ALL of this original footage is the maximum def you can get that was suitable for the BluRay version they are releasing anyway,  there is absolutely no reason why they cannot release at least the same amount of footage as they released in the DVD version of the series, if not more.<br /><br />The decision they have made, IMHO, and to be generous about it, is brain-damaged. They are missing out on making a fortune by not releasing, as I would suggest, 2 versions (neither being the extent set they plan to flog) of the BluRay set, viz -<br /><br />1.  Gold BluRay Edition - Same content as the previous extant DVD set, but in BluRay format.<br />2.  Platinum BluRay Edition - Same as Gold, but with ALL the extra outtakes, bloopers, interviews and every mm of the original footage as special features that were ever shot, so the buyers of this edition get to see and hear everything that was ever done on set and recorded on camera. In this way, no fan could ever complain of having anything that was filmed on the Friends' set being withheld from their viewing pleasure, and they would never have to bring out another set, unless of course a new technology comes up better than BluRay. This is still on the cards, as below.<br /><br />BluRay has a max resolution of 1920×1080p which matches present HDTV monitor standards, but even now, there are Ultra-high-definition televisions (UHDTV) with the following resolutions -<br /><br />2160p (3840 × 2160 progressive scan)<br />4320p (7680 × 4320 progressive scan)<br /><br />Say if the above 7680 × 4320 resolution was on a 40\\" wide screen. The resolution, assuming square pixels, would then be 7680/40 = 192 pixels per inch (BluRay, using the same screen would be 1920/40 = 48 pixels per inch, 4 times less). The human eye, with normal vision, can resolve up to about 2400 pixels per inch (Google on it) because the mechanical resolution of a normal retina is increased by stereoscopic vision and brain processing, including cognitive interpolation and possibly also extrapolation. So, human resolution is still about 2400/192 = 12.5, or to be conservative, about 10 times better than even the present Ultra-high-definition televisions which are in turn 4 times better than BluRay. So the human eye can resolve up to 40 times better than even BluRay.<br /><br />So, if the original Panavision-sourced 35mm Friends film stock masters and submasters have a resolution better than BluRay, Warner could bring out post BluRay versions later. Maybe that's why they are holding back, but even this argument makes no sense, as it would be ages before post BluRay players and screens with even higher resolutions become commonplace, and we as the viewing public will probably have to endure another format war like the recent BluRay/HDDVD scuffle.<br /><br />In conclusion, Warner has no cogent and honest reason why they cannot release a BluRay version at least as content-full and rich as the present extant DVD widescreen release. Any excuse they give is simply some kind of smokescreen to hide some other agenda not conducive to viewers expectations. We have great expectations of them. We greatly expect their provisioning should not grate on our sensibilities as it now seems to do with this proposed BluRay release. Maybe they simply wanted to get it out in time for Thanksgiving/Christmas sales and did not have the time or energy to do it properly. Still not acceptable IMHO. Their enormous resources would be able to rise to the challenge, so even this commercial reason also does notmake sense.<br /><br />Awe the best, cheers and enjoy.<br /><br />Michael (Awethentic)<br />PS - Apologies for any Australianisms and or spelling. M.ove 7680 × 4320 resolution was on a 40\\" wide screen.

B0000CABJ1|5.0|The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer was an impulse buy that was well worth it. Even though I had some of her music in my personal catalog, this Two CD mega hit collection bookends her music as apart of my life's soundtrack. There are many other possibles offered by Amazon on this artist, but for myself and ultimate fan, this choice is truly \\"the best of Donna Summer\\". Her soaring version of \\"I'll Go with You,\\" is a powerful reminder to me of her artistry and vocal talents that Summer has left in a muscial time capsule that will always celebrate that she was a true cultural icon, gone but not forgotten. RIP Donna Summer, I will always love you!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book isn't very good if you're looking for hardcore erotica. Instead, it's a fun little romance that includes some very light elements of S&M. If you aren't interested in billionaire romances, then you probably wouldn't like this one either.
B008SVFX96|4.0|This is a short and sweet review. You can skip \\"Weathering the Storm\\", \\"I'll Always Walk Beside You\\", and \\"World\\". I consider these as \\"fillers\\" as every album ever released seems to have these throw away, \\"B-side\\" type tunes and are really not so good. The rest of the songs are pure gold and you'd be missing out if you don't give them a listen. Welcome back Richie!
0156034565|5.0|Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is the first novel by British author, Paul Torday, and combines his love of salmon fishing with his literary talent. When fish scientist, Dr Alfred Jones is asked to advise on a project to set up a salmon fishing run for a sheikh in the highlands of the Yemen, he finds the idea laughable and dismisses the idea of any involvement. But his boss soon presents him with an ultimatum that has him reconsidering his position. When he meets Sheikh Muhammad's charming agent, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, and later still, the Sheikh himself, he finds his scorn turning to interest and enthusiasm. Using a format of a collection of documents (emails, diary entries, memos, extracts of interviews, print media articles, extracts from the Hansard, letters, extracts from an unpublished autobiography, a TV script), Torday puts together a delightfully funny and moving tale that is also thought-provoking and even educational. The reader does not need to like or know about fishing or the Yemen to enjoy this novel. The bureaucracy will remind many readers of Yes, Prime Minister, with the same laugh-out-loud results. Much more than salmon or the Yemen, this book is about people and caring, about impossibility, about faith and hope and love. Winner of the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction, and no wonder! Entertaining and very enjoyable.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I've spent some time hiking on the AT and out west with friends, therefore, not alone. But I can sympathize with her physical pain, the blisters and finding ways to adjust the pack so it's comfortable. Learning ways to be able to hike 8 hour days and the tricks of how much stuff, especially water, you can carry and not be too bogged down. I can sympathize with the self-discovery journey too being in a singlehood season in my life. I'm enjoying very much Cheryl's interpretation of that time in her life. It's an easy, interesting read that I can settle down with right before bedtime. A story of self-discovery, bravery, trust, reflection, discernment, resolution and peace for some of the demons that haunt her. I've enjoyed this read very much!
1439102430|5.0|Bones Are Forever is the 15th book in the Temperance Brennan series by Kathy Reichs. The action starts in Quebec with the corpse of a newborn baby in the bathroom of a run-down apartment. Tempe discovers the mummified remains of another two babies, and investigation results indicate an Edmonton prostitute with at least three aliases. Liaison with Edmonton PD has Ryan and Tempe travelling there in search of the mother and possible further corpses. Events there send Tempe, the arrogant RCMP officer Oliver Hasty (with whom Tempe has a long-ago history) and Detective Andrew Ryan (whose attitude seems to indicate a problem he is not sharing) to the small diamond mining community of Yellowknife, in the North West Territories. Is the mother fleeing from her violent pimp? Or is there more to the story? Are the local drug lords involved? What about the environmentalists? Reichs fills this novel with plenty of information, presenting it in an easy-to-assimilate form. As well as the expected facts related to forensic anthropology (determining age of neonatal bones, biogeographical ancestry, exhumation, dental records, determination of sex from bones), Reichs gives the reader plenty of facts about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, diamond mining, exploration, staking claims, prospecting permits, gold mining and arsenic. I even learned facts about our own BHP Billiton mining company. The characters and dialogue were back up to Reichs usual standard, and the plot was original, with enough twists to keep the reader guessing. A big improvement on Flash and Bones.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|I am really lovin' this CD. Does it have 1 song that really stands out as the \\"hit\\"? No. I think that is a very enjoyable album though. I like all the songs, there is not one dog on the whole CD. I think that the songs have a greater sense of depth and and maturity that wasn't there before - and I like that. Probably the best rockin' song is the remix of Flesh and Bone. I have listened to it many times and am not sick of it yet. :)
B0085MNZ66|3.0|this game isn't bad. i made it to level 10 before i got stuck, but by then i didn't feel like struggling with it anymore, esp. with no built-in undo &amp; reset buttons. it is a lot like &quot;flow&quot; in that it quickly becomes too difficult to bother with. hints (or even some instructions) might help. the one thing i really do like about this game is the sounds. every move sounds like plunking on a guitar and it's very nice. anyway, i'll probably uninstall this game soon. i don't see myself returning to it again and again.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This movie is much better than I expected. I went in with very low expectations, particularly because of Kristen Stewart's involvement.

0380713802|5.0|Having lived in the Netherlands for ten years, I found this book amusing and interesting. I had experienced a lot of what I read or knew the areas quite well, as author Bill Bryson told his humorous tales.At first I wondered why he did this without his wife and then realized it was to gather information for the book. This choice to go alone probably gave us better insight on his travels, as it was about his adventures rather than a family experience.<br /><br />It would take me reams of paper to tell the best parts of this book, because it is all good, and funny. I don't laugh at many books but I had tears in my eyes with some of the exploits I read about. Even to buying souvenirs Mr. Bryson made it a amusing situation, such as buying crucifix corn- on- the- cob holders or a Musical Last Supper toilet paper holder from shops in the Vatican City. Equally amusing was his rendition of using the Italian-English phrases in Fodor's guide to Italy. Not to spoil your fun, I won't elaborate, but run out and buy this book, now in reprint form. While you are at it, buy several copies for gifts for those of your friends and relatives who want to, wanted to, or will travel to Europe. Bill Bryson's Neither Here Nor There is the perfect book for armchair traveling.
B009IJJ8UM|5.0|If you like detective shows like Psych, Monk, and The Mentalist then this show is definitely for you. Besides the fact that its a reinvention of the classic Sherlock Holmes story, this tv show keeps you guessing throughout the entire 45 minutes. I found myself trying to find clues and do my own deductions to try and beat the story line to the punch, which i know is almost impossible to do but i still try. I loved this show and i will be following it closely.

1416955070|5.0|Read more: [...]    A very long time ago, I used to write Harry Potter fanfiction.  And so did a girl named Cassandra Clare--who, by the way, was exponentially more successful at it.  When I spotted this book on shelves a couple years ago, I freaked out.  Surely this could not be the same Cassandra Clare who wrote Drago Dormiens!  It was.  In case you were wondering.  Long story short, I hoarded these books when Borders went out of business and it took me way too long to read them.  I got about two chapters into this book before falling in love.  I love Jace.  I love Clary.  I love Simon.  I love every single character and every single page.  I love how nerdy and artsy and elegant Clare's writing is, how sarcastic, how full of snarky witticisms and anime and art references.  This is the kind of fantasy book I've always aspired to write.  And now I'm reading book two, because I can't wait for more and I can't believe I've been missing out on this fandom for so long!  Read it.  It's phenomenal.  Original, full of action, fantastically well written.  I'm going to stop gushing here and start gushing below.    plot . 5/5  No silly set-up.  No waits.  Clare throws you right into the plot page one.  I admit, I thought the blue-haired boy was going to be a love interest, at first.  Clare shocked me, and she never stopped shocking me.  Every chapter is something new that throws a wrench in the plans and moves the plot forward.  Even the long passages of exposition aren't slow, because they're so interesting!  The Shadowhunter world is amazingly rich and well-developed.  I feel like I know it, and could find it somewhere if only I knew how to see like Clary could see.  It didn't let up until the end--and even then, the twists came to the last page.  There was one plot point that freaked me out.  It has to do with the familial relationship between two characters, and I hope Clare resolves it well, because right now I'm just going EW.    concept . 5/5  Demons aren't new.  Vampires aren't new.  Demon hunters aren't new.  The Mortal Instruments takes them all and makes them feel new.  I don't see the comparison to Buffy as strongly as some critics do, but I guess there's a similarity in the Whedonish wittiness of the writing and, ya know, demon hunters.  But Clare does it differently.  It's more epic.  More pretty.  There's something about it that makes you want to dance in fairy rings and listen to Celtic folk music.  It's so richly developed that even the silly parts, like demon-run motorcycles, feel believable.    characters . 5/5  I claim Simon for marriage.  Just saying.  Also Jace.  Okay, so I love them all.  Clare's characters are multifaceted and just whimsical enough to make you laugh out loud.  Jace and Simon are both delightfully snarky, which happens to be my weakness, and so easy to fall in love with.  Clary has plenty of wit herself, which is great.  Even though she's new to this world and not a good fighter, it never feels like she's letting the boys drag her along.  She takes charge of her own destiny and kicks plenty of ass.  Alec and Isabelle are also awesome.    style . 6/5  So, how many times can I use \\"snarky\\" in one blog post?  Clare just knows sarcasm.  The dialogue, the descriptions, the writing--it's all a mix of clever quips, amusing turns of phrase, and very pretty descriptions.  She knows how to build a scene without bogging you down in description.  She knows how to keep the action going in a fight and go into slow motion for that epic kiss.  She knows how to lighten the tension of a dark moment with a bit of wry humor.  I'm enamored.    mechanics . 5/5  I could have done without the epilogue, but it didn't take away enough to make me dock points.  It just didn't add much.  I thought everything was nice and polished.    take home message  The rebirth of YA fantasy--a breathtaking adventure told with a hint of whimsy, a dash of wit, and plenty of heart.
B0000060NH|4.0|As Motown began its migration from Detroit to Los Angeles, Motown Productions had already experienced a wealth of critical and commercial success in television with the award winning, Neilsen #1 \\"T.C.B.\\" and \\"G.I.T.\\" television specials. That was followed up with a repeat success with Diana Ross' Emmy nominated, Neislen winning debut television special from 1971' \\"Diana!\\" and then The Jackson Five \\"Goin' Back to Indiana\\" with almost the identical cast to Diana. And then \\"The Temptations TV Show\\". They began moving into the movies in a big way with the Oscar nominated, \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" starring the Queen of Motown, Diana Ross. Marvin Gaye had also starred in 2 movies,\\"Chrome and Hot Leather\\" and \\"The Ballad of Andy Crocker\\". Motown's involvement in those projects remains unclear. However, Motown did indeed release Marvin's soundtrack to the blaxipoiltation movie, \\"Trouble Man\\" joining his peers issac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield. Marvin garnered a Top 10 Hot 100 single with the bluesy/jazzy title track that also went Top 5 R&B taking the soundtrack to platinum level sales with a Top 15 Pop Album and to the upper reaches of the R&B Album chart (#3)! Marvin remained true to the soundtrack and score without trying to create a pop/R&B album with single candidates. The title track would be the only single released. Despite that, there were several programmable instrumentals that received a respectable amount of quiet storm and even jazz airplay on \\"Don't Mess with Mr. T\\", \\"Poor Abbey Walsh\\" and \\"Cleo's Apartment\\" for instance. Though Marvin had acting roles in the aforementioned movies, he would only be responsible for the soundtrack to \\"Trouble Man\\". After the phenomenal, still building success of \\"What's Going On\\", Marvin also released the Top 10 single, \\"You're the Man\\" continuing in the socio-political slant of \\"What's Going On\\". \\"Trouble Man\\" was a straight ahead look at live in the inner city ghettos. Time has only proven that Marvin had a natural understanding of jazz even beyond his love of vocal crooning. Now Motown has given \\"Trouble Man\\" the Expanded Edition treatment, something afforded The Supremes, Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye catalog.

I think it's the best sci-fi novel I've read in a while and i have read a lot of the greats! I really enjoyed the flow of the story, it's captivating and keeps you hungry for more. Also the characters are likable which I think is important in keeping a ones interest. I highly recommend this series!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Snagged the 4 disc set off Amazon for the same price as the 2 disc set, making it a no-brainer.  This is probably why I see the 2 disc set not exactly flying off the shelves at places like Wal-Mart.  I mean if you can get the 4 disc set on here cheaper, why not.  Anyways, can't wait for the sequel.  As for this movie, top marks!  It's my favorite superhero movie of all time.
0425170349|2.0|Rainbow 6 is okay.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-Clancy is masterful at describing the Rainbow team's actions in the field.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-The book is way too long. So many of the chapters felt like unnecessary filler. Clancy spends way too much time with the people testing the virus on the kidnapping victims in the lab. We get it, the Shiva is a killer virus. We don't need a chapter devoted to every single time a patient coughs.<br /><br />-Clancy has no idea how normal humans interact. The conversation scenes between Domingo and his wife are painful to read. Steve Seagal movies have more natural sounding dialogue.<br /><br />-Rainbow troopers are too much like super heroes that can never be harmed. Every mission goes perfectly. Every shot is hit. The bad guys are all bumbling idiots. The only time they ever took a punch was when the Irish terrorists basically ambushed them. Besides that brief moment they were 100% successful at every single task.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|Nothing special about this game. Very basic graphics and sound. It's worth it playing as a FAOTD. It's a color matching game where you drag lines between matching colors and if the line passes through another color it changes color.
0375703764|5.0|This was actually one of my inspirations for [[ASIN:B009ETN8WU Under Nether Skies (The Cambion)]], you will not be disappointed with House of Leaves.  It's really not for the light reader; it's something to dedicate yourself to understand.  You can't just read it front to back, it's more a book to adventure through, to find new things, to realize what didn't make very much sense earlier.  It can be a bit hard to follow; to make a bad pun, it's like storyception.  It's a story within another story, within another story, something like an onion.<br /><br />I can ramble on, but, bottom line is, get this book if you're down for a compelling, disturbing, enthralling read.  Again, this isn't for the casual reader, so don't bother if you're not willing to devote yourself.  Just keep an open mind; a very open mind, else you'll hit the end and scratch your head saying, \\"What just happened?\\"

B007FEFLTO|2.0|I am a HUGE Follett fan. This book is not his standard stellar writing. There were many, many sentences and paragraphs that were so poorly written that I had to read them several times to get the gist. While the finished product is Follett's, whoever was in charge of editing should be replaced for the third book in the trilogy. I have never read such poor writing from Follett. With all that said, if you can look past some of the faults you will find a good story. But, long and short, the book feels like it was rushed to meet the publish date.<br /><br />On another note I must also comment on the ridiculous price of this ebook. The idea of ebooks was to make reading more enjoyable and cost effective for the reader. With no printing costs, no postage costs, etc. $20 seems robber- baron worthy. Add that to the poor quality of the book itself, I would tell a prospective buyer to wait to get the book free at the library.

0195073401|5.0|I browsed through the reviews and I was utterly surprised to see that there have been people who have actually given this book a pretty low rating. Then I went on and read the reviews... Most of them had to do with the so called \\" high level of mathematical abilities \\" that you need to have in order to understand what's being displayed in it. Well that's true, you do indeed need to have a working knowledge of multivariable calculus, real analysis, matrix algebra, optimization theory and more. But having said that, since when did that become something of a bad thing?<br /><br />  People seem to be complaining about how the true economic insight is lost behing the rigorous mathematical construction of the models. Really? Have we reached that point when actually understanding how and why a model/theory is constructed the way it is, is something that will eventually lead us to completely miss its point and/or its implications? Do you think that the great past and present economists were people that lacked rigorous mathematical training? Do you think that people like Samuelson, Mundel, Keynes, Solow, Mahalanobis, Nash lacked an insight in economics, because they were \\"blinded\\" by the math in any way?<br /><br />  In my humble opinion the best way to understanding economics is through the \\"tough\\" path that will get you there after first being able to actually grasp the mathematics behind the theory. Only then you'll have the right to question some things on the theories presented in this or in any other book for that matter. For example some seem to be more than willing to judge axioms like preference completeness - and the impact of such axioms in the construction of the subsequent utility function - yet they still struggle with this book. That either means that there are people out there who have knowledge on order theory, functional analysis, sets and numbers yet they don't have knowledge of differential calculus and basic optimization theory.... or that they just don't know what they are talking about.<br /><br />  This is a book that you'll have to study - most likely - during your first year of your masters degree. The requirements for a comprehensive reading - for the most part -are nothing more than a working knowledge in calculus, matrix algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus, real analysis, optimization theory and so on. These are things that you should know already if you've graduated a decent undergrad program. If not start first from Chiang's Fundamental methods of mathematical economics, move to Hammond's Further mathematics for economic Analysis then to Efe's Real Analysis with economic Applications and you'll be good to go for the most part. Follow my advise and I bet that in a year or so that'll take you to read all those books - alongside your regular studying for you masters degree - you'll come back and thank me for that! If you're after insight in economics then mathematics is the only way to go... simple as that ! Mathematics do not test and/or validate the various theories.... THEY DICTATE THEM! And in the field of microeconomics there's not a single book out there that displays that in a better way than this one!<br /><br />ps: If you really want to have any of your doubts about the various theories -in every single field in economics- that you'll meet during your graduate studies and hopefully your research later on adressed, I again strongly advise you to study more pure mathematics. Kolmogorov's book on real analysis and Rudin's \\"bible\\" Real and Complex analysis are two books that every self respecting economist needs to study. Knowledge on abstract algebra/algebraic geometry/algebraic topology will help immensely with advanced game theory as well. Differential equations and difference equations and the subsequent concepts of convergence and divergence will be of great help in studying classical macroeconomic theory, growth models, international macroeconomics and so on.<br /><br />ps2: If you decided to study economics thinking that the math requirements would be relatively low, then you should have done a better research before going down that road... Either buckle up and stand up to the field's demands or admit defeat and crawl back to political sciences. Simple as that.

B000YAA68W|4.0|Marjane Satrapi presents the first part of her autobiographical series, based on the graphic novel of the same name. For those of you who haven't read the book, this movie has little in the way of plot - well, that's true of most people's lives. Instead, the fascination comes from the movie's sense of reality. Marji starts as a precocious and sometimes scary little girl of six or so, and matures into her early twenties as we watch. She gives some idea of what a child sees in the blast rubble that used to be a neighbor's house (and what used to be the neighbor). When she attends school, we see her as the permanent outsider, among but never truly of her peers' society. Then, when she returns to her family in Teheran, she brings her European sensibility into a nation teetering on the edge of repressive theocracy. She has become a stranger in her own country and family, and maybe in her own life.<br /><br />A few things leap out at a Western viewer. One might be Marjane's intense political awareness, from a very early age. It makes sense, though. She's a grand-daughter very few generations away from someone who ruled Iran, then was overthrown a handful of overthrows ago. In a nation where clan feuds recall events hundreds of years back, that puts her practically on the front line, even as a child. Her family name, Satrapi, long ago entered the English language as \\"satrap,\\" a mid-eastern ruler. No wonder she went to sleep with bedtime stories of her uncle's imprisonment and torture.<br /><br />The other striking feature of this movie is its stark visual style. People are simple line drawings, with blocky black or white patches for clothing. Backgrounds generally resemble ink wash on a rough-surfaced watercolor paper. Color doesn't exist until the very last moment - perhaps a foreshadowing of a sequel to come, more than an actual part of this movie's narrative. The simplicity won't appeal to everyone. As much as I like animation and graphic novels, I have mixed feelings about it. Still, I can't imagine this plain, stark story being told in any visual idiom less plain and stark than the movie's. Somehow, it all blends perfectly into a coming of age story that leaves triteness behind in the political prisons or urban battlefields of Marjane's growing-up years.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdbout it.

0984183523|5.0|I've read a lot of stuff about case interview preparation and I think that Cheng's materials are the best among all options, not only this book, but also his website, videos and blog. This book is very comprehensive and goes straight to the core issues in the consulting selection process, so don't bothers the reader with a lot of frameworks or formulas to memorize. He is very didatic and candid about the core dificulties in the process and gives a clear picture about areas and skills to explore in the preparation process.<br /><br />A \\"must read\\" for anyone thinking of entering in the consulting business.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Casey Afleck elavated this 4 star movie to a 5 STAR. Directed by Ben Afleck--BRILLIANT JOB. His brother CASEY has the LEAD and he takes it to a WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL. I've seen Casey Afleck before and think he is an EXCELLENT actor. APPLAUSE PLEASE FOR THE AFLECK BROTHERS.<br />The movie is about the kidnapping of a little girl. Afleck plays a private detective who, along with his working partner girlfriend, is approached by the girl's uncle and grandmother to help find the little girl. He is a neighborhood boy and they believe he might know people in the hood that might not be willing to talk to the police.<br />So right they are. Rough neighborhood, drug addicted mother, rough characters, drugs, violence, rough language make up the world of the kidnapped girl. Not a pleasant world to live in. CHARACTER ACTORS ARE AWESOME. Everyone does a very good job. NOT FOR CHILDREN. Glad I don't live in that world.  But, I thought the movie is great. DISTURBING, but GREAT. You will not be unaffected!!!
B0085MNZ66|1.0|Another person with immediate FC issues. It's not like the RAZR is a rare or obsolete phone; there is no good reason for this product to FC upon opening. Testing of apps should be reasonably extensive and this one didn't get the testing necessary.<br /><br />I will say that it's good to see a FAOTD that doesn't have invasive and unnecessary permissions. I just wish that the developers did proper testing before release. FAOTD us not for beta testing.

Put that aside I eventually get a new one shipped only to find that this one to doesn't work at all, and after digging through every forum post and solution nothing worked.<br /><br />Save your money and don't invest into this product or anything else they sell, extremely unprofessional and half broken products that make you jump through to many hoops just to get basic functionality from it.

B008C1O8CA|3.0|Green Day...the band that opened my eyes and ears to music and all that it can be. The band that my own mother said will never amount to anything. Look at where we are now and Green Day has been around for almost 20 years and now have done it all. The threesome now quartet with a second guitarist are back with the first in a trilogy of albums that are said to have Green Day going back to their Pop punk roots.<br /><br />'Uno' to me is a little bit of a disappointment to me, but not entirly. Mearly because I kept hearing that this was an album that would bring me back to the 'Dookie' years, when in fact it feels more like we are back in the 'Warning' years. Sure there is a lot of immature lyrics a ton of foul language, but what it is lacking is the old sound. I am sorry but songs like 'Carpe Diem', 'Oh Love' and 'Let Yourself Go' do not sound like 'Burnout', 'When I Come Around' and 'Welcome To Paradise'. My favorite Green Day album is 'Insomniac' and 'Uno' doesn't even come near a good comparison. Again, this album is a fun listen and I am glad that they took a break from the whole rock opera thing they have been doing for the past 8 years. Still, I am going to continue with this trilogy with an open mind and I have a feeling that each of these albums are going to be something in their own light. So, for now...we are off to a formidable start with Green Days' return.

B0093ICOJ0|5.0|They called it the 'Dream' project, the 'Big' one. So big in fact that this is a review of part 1 of this new DCAU film.<br /><br />'The Dark Knight Returns' was the comic that changed the comic book world forever with a story that was so brash and dark, the camp and classic good vs. evil was shattered. I always knew that there would be an animated film down the road and now it is finally here. I made sure to read the first two parts of the entire comic before I purchased this film and it was good to do so. The film adaption of this story is so beautiful with a few small subtile differences which are barely noticiable especially if you haven't read the origonal material in a while. The changes don't destroy the film at all because they stuck very close to it and really made it work. The voice cast was great. It took a while for me to warm up to Peter Weller voicing Batman, because I know that Kevin Conroy and even Bruce Greenwood would have been able to voice Batman in this film just as well. Still, he did a great job and the rest of the cast inclucing Ariel Winter, Gary Anthony Williams, Michael McKeon all contributed wonderfully. The action is just as intense in the film. The punches are earthshattering the faceoffs are hard hitting and intense and nothing is held back in the slightest. One thing I love about WBs DCAU is the fact that these are real fans putting together shows and movies with the comic fan in minds. Making sure it is something that makes the viewer happy, but also seeing how far they can push the bar in the world of animation as well as showing that animation can be for adults as well as kids.<br /><br />Of course, 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 1' will not be perfect until the second half is released, but I am definitely going to be one of the first in line to pick it up and complete the story. I am actually hoping that this will not be the last of the 'dream/big' projects in the DCAU film library. I would love Crisis on Infinate Earths', 'Blackest Night' and especially 'Kingdom Come'. Still, after seeing this film released I have a feeling there are more treats in store for us fans.Night' and especially 'Kingdom Come'. Still, after seeing this film released I have a feeling there are more treats in store for us fans.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Same great game play that's been available on iOS devices has finally come to android. Just as responsive and looks no different.<br />On iOS there was integration with Games Center and it provided you with your friends' Max distances. It was fun trying to keep ahead of them, but not necessary.<br />The game being on the Amazon App store is also slightly annoying. It provides no known benefit and you have to keep the Amazon App store app installed. Hopefully the game is working its way through the regular store.<br />The most annoying, but still not deal breaking, are the bugs. I've had gadgets or my jetpack swap out on me for no reason between runs, vehicle magnets unequip themselves, or a double coin bonus not show up because I quit the game before using it. I even used the quit option on the main menu.<br /><br />I still find this a very fun game and will keep playing it because the slight grievances aren't enough to ruin the game.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Since 'Iron Mans' 2008 release we the fans have been eagerly awaiting the assembly of one of the greatest Super-Hero forces in comic history. Not just as a treat for fans, but as a pioneering film uniting various individual film stars in a union that has never been done in film. IT WORKED!<br /><br />'The Avengers' is such an incredible and fun film. Each character is given just enough time to shine and everything from the battle sequences to the jokes had perfection written all over it. Mark Ruffalo taking Edward Nortons' spot as Bruce Banner, was the biggest thing for me to see because it was a pretty big role to fill. It was as if Norton had never been there in the first place. Mark Ruffalo was one of the best additions to this film saga and don't get me started on how Hulk was in the movie. The part that I loved most about this film was the ending, because you are left knowing that this story is far from finished and it is going to be bigger and better.<br /><br />'The Avengers' is of course going to be compared to 'The Dark Knight Rises' as to which was the better film. There is no comparison they are two different movies, but as great as Dark Knight was, The Avengers was just so much more from a pure entertainment perspective. If you missed this movie on the big screen, shame on you. Still, the movie is worth getting, I know I will watch it over and over again.<br /><br />(End of Book 1)

B008I3R2VG|5.0|The Killers are a band that sucked me in when Hot Fuss hit stores back in 2004. They were a sound unlike anything on the scene and a return to a sound that had been dorment for almost 20 years. Since 'Hot Fuss', while their music has been good they never stepped up above the greatest of their first release...until now.<br /><br />I have no clear understanding as to why there is dislike to 'Battle Born'. The Killers have never sounded this raw and wonderful. Brandon Flowers' vocals have improved so much. He has to ability to channel so many great vocalist such as Mark Knopfler (From Here On Out), Freddy Mercury (Battleborn) and Bono (Heart of A Girl). The songs themselves are so beautiful with a perfect mixing of new wave and rock n' Roll. Each and every song on this album is an amazing listen that fills you with different emotions and just gives you goosebumps all over.<br /><br />I don't know where this band is heading, but what I can take from this album is there have been some great releases this year, but 'Battleborn' may in fact be the best one to date. Also, the deluxe edition was not as good as expected. Sure there is nothing wrong with extra music, but the 3 extra songs just don't hold a candle to the actual 12 songs on 'Battleborn'.

B006885FZI|5.0|After watching \\"Band of Brothers\\" about a hundred times, I had expectations of the same product with a little \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" mixed in for atmosphere.  A background of a pacific atoll instead of Normandy but otherwise the same kind of narrative of another 'band of brothers' throughout the Japanese campaign in the Pacific.  However in \\"The Pacific\\", the story line splinters as the men go in separate directions during the conflict so it is more like a bunch of mini-movies instead.  And like in Game of thrones, favorite characters die early and often.  What sounds like a criticism really is praise since while the story in the first series may be an exceptional one (where most of the men stayed together throughout most of the main storyline, the sadder, more gloomy stories in \\"The Pacific\\" feel more like the reality of war.

1590171993|5.0|John Williams' \\"Stoner\\" is at its heart an existential examination of Life. What is it? What should we do with it? What does it mean to experience a well-lived life? Much of the world's greatest literature is inspired by the question of what it means to be human. \\"Stoner\\" surely belongs in the pantheon of the best literary explorations of this subject.<br /><br />Stoner is a cradle-to-grave biography of the eponymous central character William Stoner. Born to a hard scrabble farming life in the American midwest at the turn of the nineteenth century, young Bill Stoner has something deep within him activated by exposure to higher education. His destiny is forever altered by this experience and sends him on a career of academics and teaching at the local university in Missouri.<br /><br />His life is an extremely modest one and unremarkable in most respects. He marries, fathers a child, quietly pursues his teaching and literary research career, endures a marriage that is essentially loveless, and has life-long conflicts with a department chair who is determined to frustrate his academic career for a perceived slight. Throughout all of these common difficulties, he soldiers on--quietly and without drama. He accepts every hardship imposed upon him, demanding neither attention nor sympathy from others. He is a man of times and of his place, an era in which society expected individuals to manage their own personal problems at home and not to air them in public for to do so would be an embarrassment to all. Bucking these societal conventions never even occurs to him. How times have changed!<br /><br />The plot follows Bill Stoner to his eventual end. Having only known true love once in his life during an understated affair, the reader is invited to evaluate the entirety of Stoner's life, just as he does. What had he accomplished? What opportunities did he miss? Was his life a \\"good\\" one? What does that question even mean? You'll draw your own conclusions, of course. This, to me, is one of the hallmarks of great literature: you get to fill in the blanks yourself.<br /><br />This is a subtle book. No ham-handed messages here. Williams treats his reader as adults, capable of making their own way through his eloquent, quiet prose. It evoked in me sympathy, empathy, indignation and a pensive attitude.

How cheap is that? I challenge Disney, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Paramount, whomever made this edition to make a code available to 2 Disc edition purchasers.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|Ok... After struggling with myself if I should or should not write about this album until I stop feeling so strongly about it, yet, since every time I log onto YouTube I seem to find a discussion between 'true fans' on either side of hating/loving it, I thought I might as well give it a go now. Hell, it's been over a year.<br /><br />To get the main point out of the way: I hate this album.<br /><br />Yep. I hate it. I hate it with every fiber of my being, and the following paragraphs will serve as a means to try to articulate my reasons for doing so. If this sounds more like an overly long rant than a review, my apologies beforehand.<br /><br />First of all, a personal background: I've been an Opeth fan since 'Ghost Reveries', and before anyone tries to label me as a newcomer, and someone who doesn't 'understand' Opeth's true sound, I want to clarify that I'm 25 years old (in 2012) and while I would never deem myself an expert in 1970's prog music, or even as knowledgeable a metal fan as some, I'm a guy who went after every single Opeth album since first spending the 50 bucks (in local, Brazilian currency) to get their 2005 album, when I was 18. I went from a casual fan to an avid worshiper after I bought 'Still Life' (to this day the only album I own three copies of), and probably not a day goes by without some Opeth song being played in my PC or my iPod. I own every single CD and DVD to have reached Brazilian shores, no mean feat living in a country which seems intent on loving horrible music (god, I hate samba...).<br /><br />So what made me love Opeth in the first place? Well to put it simply whenever someone told me I was getting too old to still like metal, I told them to listen to Opeth, particularly 'Still Life' and 'My Arms Your Hearse'. I called Opeth 'Metal for grownups'. Just as I would call my love for Blind Guardian as 'Metal for the fantasy/sci-fi loving kid still within me'. Every Opeth album was dense, thick with layers not only in terms of their musicianship, but also in terms of their lyrics. 'My Arms, Your Hearse' is an album structured in a way that the lyrics of every song ends with the title of the next song, meanwhile going through the year's seasons in a perfect circle. It's a story about a ghost haunting the woman he loved when still alive. The lyrics were powerful, and the songs were equally powerful because there seemed to be something behind them, a driving force carrying the album to momentous moment after momentous moment. 'Still Life' is one of the few albums I call absolutely perfect. Sure, many claim 'Blackwater Park' to be Opeth's best, and in terms of the quality of each song it's an argument I can't disagree with, but the sheer brilliance of the concept in 'Still Life' make it a personal favorite of mine that has yet to be topped by any other CD, from any other band. In 'Still Life', Mikael and the band weren't content with delivering a concept through simple narrative terms. You don't just say 'I love you but I can't be with you', you say 'Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime, She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme, But baffled herself with the final line, My promise is made but my heart is thine'. Opeth weren't content with saying: 'And as I died I saw Melinda behind me', they would rather say 'Cloak-captured sighs of relief, As the primal touch brought me back, And the last sight I did see is still here, Beckoning right behind me'. You may say that it's not about the lyrics, and that the rhythm of the song it's more important, but to me, these kinds of lyrics put a power behind each of the songs. And in each Opeth album, I could feel them striving for perfection. Trying their hardest to surpass each previous album.<br /><br />To me, Opeth are now trying their utmost not to surpass but to deviate from each album. I understand the feeling of not wanting to play the same thing for the rest of their lives, but it kind of breaks my heart reading an Opeth interview with Mikael saying that he now can't listen to 'Orchid' and 'Morningrise'. Even more so because 'Forest of October' is still one of my favorite Opeth tracks and 'The Night and the Silent Water', while somewhat crude, is a deeply emotional song about Mikael trying to cope with the death of his grandfather. That is without mentioning the absolutely beautiful 'To Bid You Farewell', which brought a hardcore metalhead friend of mine to tears (and I rightly mocked him for it). Does the need to experiment really surpass all that?<br /><br />Still, that wouldn't make me hate an Opeth album... I understand the need to experiment. And I wouldn't fault Opeth if they had released an amazing outing of their own brand of 70's prog. If it had the Opeth feel, the Opeth drive, the haunting beauty of the songs that made them a force to be reckoned with in the metal world, I would have loved every minute and given this album a perfect score. My main problem is that it's no such thing. When I saw the video to 'The Devil's Orchid' I was excited, I liked the feel of it... It made me wonder what else was in the album, because never had Opeth released the strongest song of the album as a single (you can make a case for 'The Grand Conjuration', but let's face it whoever directed that video butchered the song)... Their best songs aren't made to be appreciated by the mainstream media. 'Still Life' and 'Blackwater Park's riffs are downright weird and off-putting to most who listen to them. Yet, after listening to the album, I can say that, for me, 'The Devil's Orchard' is the best track in it. It is for certain the most 'active' (am I a heretic if I say 'lively'?), apart from 'Slither', which I get is an homage to Dio, but has no place being in the main tracklist... I mean, it's a 'happy' song... Happy! In an Opeth album! 'I Feel the Dark' is the only other song of the album that I actually like, and, I swear to you, is also the first time in my many (many) listens to Opeth where midway through the song I had thoughtthe CD had skipped to another track. Then there's the middle sludge of 'Nepenthe/Haxprocess/Famine' which is just a big pile of mediocre songs that fail to have any identifying characteristics... anything that made them stand out from the rest. 'The Lines in My Hand' is another good song, because it actually feels 'evil' without being heavy (remember when Opeth could do that?). 'Folklore' is perhaps the only song that I could safely say wouldn't feel out of place within a King Crimson album. It still doesn't make it a particularly good Opeth song...<br /><br />Am I referencing a bit too much their past stuff? Yes... probably. Yet that's the greatest irony with this album: it's called 'Heritage', and it completely neglects Opeth's own history, its own record of amazing efforts. The greats will always be compared not with other bands they are competing against, but against their own greatest albums. If 'The Who' put out a CD with recordings of Daltrey and Townsend farting into instruments it would still be vastly superior to most bands on the top 20 lists. But would it hold up against their older stuff? And I am saddened that this is probably more than just an experiment. An attempt to make something different before going back to their roots. You don't release an experiment and at the same time remove every single song with any growling in it from your setlist. That's a punch in the face to the fans, in my opinion. And I know they've gone back and added songs like 'Deliverance' and 'The Grand Conjuration' to their most recent shows, but I'm pretty sure it had more to do with people yelling 'Play some f****** metal!' in every show they did, and less to do with a desire to play these songs.<br /><br />So this is why I hate the album, right?<br /><br />No... I hate it because it represented a split of minds to Opeth fans. I understand liking this CD, I really do. And even though I think it's madness to say it's their best album yet (seriously? better than BWP and StillLife?), I can at least respect that opinion. What I don't understand is how can quite a number of Opeth fans have become self-important idiots who are apt to label themselves 'true fans'. And while it happens in both sides of the discussion (you're only a true fan if you a)hate it; or b)love it), it is far more present on the part of those who like it, and treat it as an artistic masterpiece. And as much as I love Still Life and Blackwater Park, you would not see me calling them 'Art', for the simple reason that to me 'Art' is a word representing an abstract ideal, an ideal that means so many different things it makes it ultimately meaningless. So before anyone tells me that I'm not a true fan, or that I just don't understand what Opeth is really about, think it through... Really think it through: Are the songs in 'Heritage' better than the ones in 'Orchid'? In 'Morningrise'? In 'My Arms, Your Hearse'? In 'Still Life'? In 'Blackwater Park'? In 'Deliverance'? In 'Damnation'? In 'Ghost Reveries'? Even in 'Watershed'?<br /><br />If you said yes and you truly enjoy this for the songs, if you truly prefer this new side of Opeth, congrats. I wish I could be like that. I hope you are mature enough to consider your taste for what it is: a preference. Not better or superior to anyone else's. If you're anything like me and you said no to every single question, and you still think 'Heritage' is brilliant because of its boldness and artistic vision, consider that, at most, all of these things are secondary to good songs, and since this is Opeth we are talking about, our standards should be higher.

B0058RCVYS|4.0|what a wonderful movie for people that wants to  watch how complications of life cam evolve into something that will will change your ideas for how YOU want things to be, and still be ok with.  It  could possibly happen in real life. bitter sweet. I cried but could also see the sweetness in how their lives completly changed  pathways from how they thought it would be  and how old roads ended up meeting again. It was all about life's ups and downs and about the message of staying to telling the truth and how people cope with that.  I enjoyed the movie.
B001Q4Z5UY|5.0|I am very critical of movies, especially considering all hollywood seems to do anymore is make sequels and remakes. As far as remakes go, Paul W.S. Anderson does a brilliant job of creating his own unique storyline and scenery while still paying homage to the Roger Corman classic. I hate when remakes try to duplicate the original. Case in point: Psycho. Possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all, why would anyone remake an Alfred Hitchcock film?<br /><br />Death Race has all the excitement of a good slasher/action movie, all the while keeping it, for the most part, down-to-earth by creating a believable storyline, and not using CGI for the stunts. Also, Joan Allen is awesome!<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE!
1455502758|1.0|I took a look at the front of the loose cover, removed it; the hard cover was no more inspiring. I replaced the loose cover, turned the book over, glanced at the author's photo and relegated [[ASIN:1455502758 Mortality]] to the rubbish bin

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I'm not sure how this movie got by my radar.  I suppose the boring title might be to blame.  The original \\"A Princess of Mars\\" tag probably would have caught my attention better, but I suppose they were trying to avoid alienating the insecure male audience out there who avoids anything with a \\"feminine\\" title.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise this movie is!  I enjoyed it far more than Avatar (which probably isn't a fair comparison, for I wasn't much impressed with that film).  \\"John Carter\\" definitely has a better story and is overall more engaging and exciting, with excellent production design, music, costumes, pacing, good casting, cool aliens, beautiful ships and sets, and doesn't take itself too seriously, giving the audience lots of humorous moments.  It's also, I think, good for a wide range of ages (should be OK for most kids, but it's NOT just a kid's movie).  It's exciting and engaging - imagination gone wild.<br /><br />I'm stingy with 5 stars, and this isn't perfect.  But as 4 stars means simply \\"Like It\\" and 5 means \\"Love It\\", I had to swing more towards the latter.  Why this didn't make it into the category of \\"blockbuster\\" is beyond me.  What's going on with critics and audiences these days?  It's just getting harder and harder to comprehend why really good movies seem to keep getting brushed aside in favor of shallow eye-candy films (or, contrarily, over-wrought dramas) that win awards.  :/  This should win some awards.

0439023521|4.0|Personally I thought that the book was a good portrayal of an oppressive but functioning government. From a governmental stand point it was a great idea to split up the population and make them weak. The use of food as payment has proved to be a good way to control people in the past as we have seen in World War 2. I like the book because it was extremely interesting, the idea of a girl that was born into an oppressive life and has a dream of freedom is put into a fight to the death that reminds all the people in the nation of how \\"The Capitol\\" has control over the people. In this fight to the death there are 24 children put in an aria and only 1 can come out alive. Not only does Katniss come out alive, she found a way to have Peeta live too. She does this by having them both put poisonous berries in their mouths and having the \\"Game Makers\\" stop them.
0316228532|1.0|This book really feels to me like a child actress posing for playboy when she turns 18 just to prove she is a grown up now.  I'm only 26 or so pages into the book and really just contemplating not finishing it.  I don't mind \\"edgy\\" elements in a good plot and some hard reality to make a point in a story but this so far is like a string of the worst swears a kid can come up with to assert his adulthood. Maybe I'll update this if I read the rest of it, but from other reviews I guess I have rape, and child abuse to look forward to as the \\"plot?\\" thickens.....
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The action packed story of what our militery men and woman do had come to life for me. this was exciting and lots of humer. the laugh  of my life came at the end of book. read it all never will i forget what our service men and woman doThank you for every thing and may God keep you strong

B000FC0OOU|5.0|Well, I'm embarrased to say that it took me until late in life to finally get around to reading this gem. And oh, what a gem it is. Robert Jordan is one of those characters that just stays with you. I found myself a bit envious of his adventure, at least for a while (don't want to give anything away). For me, having never fought in a war, the sense of romanticism, mingled with the clear tragedy, seemed a realistic picture of what it must be like.<br /><br />Ultimately, I admire the sense of duty and honor so many of these characters display, and I wonder how many people share that kind of personal commitment today. I like to think it's still a high number (certainly we see it our military men and women), but I can't help but wonder.......<br /><br />This book is a 5-star read all the way around. Read it. You won't be sorry.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I thought that this book was excellent!  Not only true,  but it kept one's attention.  It  went back and forth between two characters, comparing their lives, one from each side of the tracks, if you will.  A  spiritual breath of fresh air to my soul
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I enjoyed this version much more than Mirror, Mirror. I think that Charlize Theron is amazing and her portrayal of the evil queen is wonderful. Definitely could have a sequel..
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I would wager the majority of Americans have no real idea about the life of our men and women in the military...especially during this time in our history.  This book reveals the obvious, as the title suggests, but also the training, the determination, the rigor, and the sacrafice made by these Navy Seals.  We are so desensitized by what is seen on TV News, things that we would never have seen years ago, and the computer graphics of movies, that the reports of various activities and missions don't impress us much.  This book will open your eyes!<br /><br />I bought this book because I wanted to hear the details of the Osama Bin Laden mission from someone who was there but I gained so much more!  I gained a respect for the Seals that I never had before.  The book is well written and keeps the reader involved throughout.  He tells his thoughts and perspective we could never know as these men do not express their feelings as a normal course in their lives.<br /><br />I wondered if this book would be political...either endorsing or critizing one of the candidates, but that doesn't happen.  The author's main purpose to write it was to set the record straight from the media reports.  A lot went into the training and preparation for such a critical mission that he didn't want it altered by hearsay and the imagination of others.<br /><br />I highly encourage the purchase and reading of this account!
B007THA4FI|3.0|This is the most expensive Kindle edition I've ever bought, and I did so only because I consider J K Rowling an awesome writer and story-crafter based on the HP books, and I just had to read her first novel for adults.<br /><br />Sadly, I find it much lacking.  Yes, there is an interesting picture of small town life in England; yes, there is humor; but is there really a story?  In my opinion, not.  There were too many characters from the beginning and not enough of them memorable.  There was not enough of a story to catch my interest.  This is the kind of novel I actually would not voluntarily read under most circumstances -- lots of social commentary and not much interesting action.  I had to wonder -- does JKR think only kids enjoy action and suspense???<br /><br />I also have to comment on the writing style.  JKR used a taut style throughout the HP books, and I understand that short, tight sentences are particularly suited to juvenile fiction.  But why go entirely in the other direction and use long run-on sentences and paragraphs complete with paranthetical asides?  Halfway in-between would have been better.  I enjoy an endless sentence when written by a master like JRR Tolkien, but I'm afraid these sentences don't display the same genius.<br /><br />There are undoubtely people who will find this book fun to read (those who enjoy social commentary), but I found that the steep Kindle price was not justified by the product.  (And I want to mention that I do understand it is the publisher, not Amazon who sets the price.  I do appreciate Amazon offering a Kindle edition.)

0316228532|1.0|Let me say first, I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series, and I'm an adult with a literature degree currently teaching high school English.  I've read the Potter series four times all the way through and have gotten more out of it every time.  I was so excited to have a new J.K. book and pre-ordered a hard copy and a Kindle version.  I only made it through five and half chapters and am thoroughly disgusted and disappointed.  As a friend said after I told her about my experience, \\"It's like the child actor who grows up and goes into porn just to prove they are no longer a child.\\"  Why, J.K., why?<br /><br />Almost any literature lover or student can tell you that the hottest trend right now is young adult fiction, particularly the dystopian genre.  While there are good, better, best novels in this arena, one thing they tend to have in common is their appeal to both juveniles and adults.  Rowling had a good thing going with her young adult series that translated into a loyal fan base of ALL ages.  Why mess that up?<br /><br />Reading what I did of Casual Vacancy left me feeling violated, like I need to wash my mind out with a bar of soap.  I could have forgiven the copious use of the F-word, this is British after all and they don't have our same American compunction of using it.  I could have even maybe gotten on board with the rhetorical choices being character appropriate...well, if she had developed the characters better.  What I couldn't get over was having to suffer through the minds of a horny teenage boy and his descriptions of his personal, public, and private sexual encounters, and at least one equally horny, but completely asinine adult male.  Not to mention the overt references to the female genitalia.<br /><br />I'm not a prude and I've read a vast amount of good and bad literature over the years, including the more recent Game of Thrones.  The Song of Fire and Ice series is very adult in nature, but the character development is stellar and the actioncounter-balances the more raw sexual moments in way that makes you believe you are reading something that is an honest view on a particular time period and society.  Casual Vacancy just reads as crass.  I've already returned my Kindle copy and will be shipping back the hard copy as well.
0307592731|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a few years. Wild had me crying within the first 2 chapters during my NYC subway commute (the only time I can find time to read), which was totally unexpected and almost embarrassing when some tourists sat down next to me and I dreaded them asking me for directions. I always gauge a \\"good\\" book or movie as one that can make me feel emotion, and this one certainly had me all riled up.<br /><br />The writing in itself was so perfect that it was like reading my own thoughts, and I grabbed at each page, each chapter, not wanting them to end....not wanting Strayed to reach the end of the PCT. God, what will I read once Wild ends? (I only have a few pages left).<br /><br />I am so glad I bought the hardbound version so that I can share it with my sister and many others in my life! Highly recommended for women under 40 raised by single-parent mothers or young professionals struggling to find their way.
B000EZ7ZYA|3.0|Will Smith performs well, as per usual. The premise is interesting; however, there are various frustrating aspects to the film. Despite that, I still recommend the movie as it was a mostly decent experience.
B007SGM084|3.0|Enjoyed reading one time, doubt if I will read again.  Seems more \\"younger women\\" will enjoy than the senior readers.  What an imagination the author has.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best scifi books I've read in the last few years. Definitely deserves the five star rating it's getting. I look forward to future works from this author.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I missed this movie when it was in the theatre so I had to wait for the DVD. It was worth the wait. I have watched it 3 times so far!
B003N0XDT4|2.0|the product was broken straight out of the box. The battery won't hold a charge at all and it makes a loud buzzing noise through the speakers. I am in the process of returning it.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it two stars though, is because aside from the bad quality control fron Fiios, the product did make a noticeable difference in sound quality through my Sennheiser HD280 pro headphones. I'm not an audiophile so the best I can describe it is that with the E7, music sounds clearer, more distinct, and more \\"three dimensional\\", it feels like one step closer to listening to music live. It didn't make a dramatic difference, but it is noticeable and worth the money.
B005LAII8K|4.0|I Compare this movie to inception because tht was the last sci-fi action movie I saw that was better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a lot). This is a solid adult sci-fi flick. The first act of the film is intriguing and shows a lot of promise. It plays out a little slower more in a drama fashion or the middle third of the film. And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.<br /><br />As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind. It's a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I would go with low expectations and you might find that there are some interesting concepts at play (poor Seth).<br /><br />Loved the way the film was shot. The audio mix is good and the editing is pretty great (Pulp Fiction style time structure). This will be a good Blu-Ray no doubt.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is a good book, I don't think that it is as bad as people have let on.  I have enjoyed reading both of these and now have moved on to number three.....:)
034580404X|5.0|Very well developed charactors. A bit racy so these books are for adult audiences. The plots are well written. I would highly recommend it.
B002RHL8DC|5.0|I got this for my grandson and I have to say I watched the whole series with him over a period of two weeks. We were hooked. Robert Carlye anchors this series for certain. Anyway, I am not a sci-fi expert but I really enjoyed all the episodes.
0525953728|3.0|This book is split into two parts.  The first 150 pages discusses the training SEALS go through and some of the prior raids Owen was a part of.  The problem is he is not specific enough discussing the training or other raids.  He probably could not go into the details because of confidentiality concerns (and law) but it makes for a very vague and lackluster read.<br /><br />The last 150 pages deal with the UBL raid.  This is very interesting.  I am very happy someone finally wrote about this because it obviously a major moment in world history but I don't think it justified an entire 300 page book (with one half of said book spent on other stuff).  Owen and these SEALS are obviously heroes but overall, this book is so so.  He basically covered all the important stuff in his 60 minutes interview and when a 1 hour TV special goes into as much detail as a 300 page book, you know the book isn't that great.
B00402FGEE|5.0|I got this for my grandson and we watched all the episodes over a period of two weeks. Robert Caryle anchors the series for certain but the other actors were very good also. So we, like many others, hope more seasons will be added.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is very useful, and it is very customizable. I love the fact that the alarm sound start off in crescendo, it's a soft awakening. Then to finish it off, to turn it off one has to solve a math problem.  Just to make sure one is fully awakened. One can also choose the type of music to use in the alarm.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movies was the best one we have seen as a family in a really long time.  We always end up seeing \\"Family Movies\\" that are not really age appropriate for an 11 year old.<br /><br />This movie had so many different age groups in it and you could tell that everyone really enjoyed themselves.<br /><br />This would be a perfect Family Movie Date Night, Romantic Date Night, Group of Friends, Little Kids and Friends, really any kind of groups could have fun with it.  My theory has always been if you don't have fun and everyone else around you is, well the movie was fun but maybe you weren't.<br /><br />We will definitely be going back to see it again and can't wait for it to come out on DVD
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Amazing it was so good i couldn't even put it down to finish reading an other day, wish it was longer though
B0030A0ZD4|3.0|I'm an avid MJ fan and I can say that I instantly clicked the 'buy' button when I saw my favorite movie, \\"Moonwalker\\" on Blu-Ray. Let me say that I was impressed visually as I have this movie on DVD and I can clearly say that this version is so much sharper and clearer almost as if you're watching this when it first came out. However, since this happens to be my favorite movie, I was quick to notice the edits made in the movie to hide any 'child abuse' and anything 'drug related' which makes the edits look funny to me because its blatantly obvious where they were made. I can say that I kind of regret my purchase a bit because those edits were honestly unnecessary and only was on screen for like 5 secs in the original unedited movie.<br /><br />Due to my disappointment in this, I had to rate the product this low and it would've been lower if not for the fact that the picture quality is brilliant. I recommend that if you're buying, to buy at your discretion if you care about having an unedited movie. If you do not care for edits and looking to get the movie regardless, then by all means go ahead. As for me, when there happens to be an unedited version of this movie on Blu-Ray, I will purchase it in a heartbeat.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great pictures love it wish there was more free packages to download especially ones for holidays other than that very nice
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Perhaps the most anticipated movie release of the past decade, and it works beautifully. Luckily, Marvel and those associated with the films have understood that gratuitous eye candy is not enough to carry a film.<br />So what we get is a good story with some tension thrown in. And by that I don't mean just between the heroes. To me one of the best and underrated aspects of the story was the tense, almost adversarial relationship that Nick Fury had with the \\"Council\\". Jackson beautifully portrayed the struggle Nick Fury had between keeping faith in his team and caving in to what the 'politicians' (ie the Council) wanted. Nick is the middle man who is getting blamed by both sides, and he has the toughest job of them all..being wedged between to factions, all the while trying to keep the peace, as it were.<br /><br />As far as the meat and potatoes of the movie:<br /><br />Stark/Ironman: Downey the main vehicle for humor, plot points and action...Ironman's appearances were done with the typical flair that we love (Stuttgart scene). Only fitting, as Downey's Tony Stark has become one of the most enjoyable characterizations we've seen in a while.<br /><br />Thor: His \\"it's never too late\\" mantra towards Loki was twofold...from the perspective of an Earth Guardian, and as a sibling who cares for his brother...almost a luke skywalker-ish performance...remember 'Jedi' where Luke never quits in trying to reform his father Darth? same concept. Thor's actual dialogue was less than the others, but Hemsworth makes it count. The only thing I would have liked was a little more detail on how/why Thor came to earth and knew Loki was still around.<br /><br />Banner/Hulk: Ruffalo did bring a nice dynamic to the role. As another reviewer said...he is like 'old faithful'..he is going to 'blow' just not sure when...only issues I had ): The Hulk...with a perm??? lol!! Also, this hulk looked far less menacing than the Edward Norton Hulk...He reminded me more of the Ang Lee Hulk. The Edward Norton Hulk was ripped, very intimidating, and downright scary!..this hulk not so much...<br /><br />Rogers/Cap: They made sure to dissipate any ridicule of the costume early on, in the scene with Coulson, and of course Stark's almost constant jabs toward Rogers/Captain America. Evans brought a nice dynamic...as a cool but passionate character who was not afraid to have his core beliefs questioned...<br /><br />Widow/Hawkeye: There were hints that something is there under the surface, and it was briefly explained but not in depth. To me this made it even more effective, without a maudlin, cliched \\"She/He saved my life, I owe him/her everything\\" moment. It was implied and that was enough. They did a good job of not taking these two characters out of their element in the action sequences...and that was a huge plus. It would have been ridiculous to see either of them performing acts comparable to what the other (super-human) heroes were doing,action-wise, and it worked just as is.<br /><br />Loki: what I liked was that Loki came across as an almost bi-polar villian. You see moments where his facial expression almost says \\"What have I done?\\", where for a brief instant he just might say \\"I was wrong, this is wrong\\"...but his greed and lust for power trumps it...very subdued Smeagol-esque performance if you will.<br /><br />This movie has sent the benchmark for Super hero movies and any forth-coming movies will have some big shoes to fill. It is a very well done movie, and the key is that the moments with the characters interacting are just as enjoyable as the very well done action sequences...can't go wrong here!!d Norton Hulk was ripped, very intimidating, and downright scary!..this hulk not so much...<br /><br />Rogers/Cap: They made sure to dissipate any ridicule of the costume early on, in the scene with Coulson, and of course Stark's almost constant jabs toward Rogers/Captain America.

B008220DIC|4.0|\\"The Master\\" (138 min.) is the latest film by Paul Thomas Anderson, who has previously brought us must-see movies like \\"Magnolias\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood\\". In this one, Anderson examines the lives of Freddie Quell (played by Joaquin Phoenix), a down on his luck loser-like WW II veteran who has major trouble adjusting to life after the war. Much of the movie takes place in 1950. After drifting around, Quell drunkenly stumbles onto a ship where Lancaster Dodd (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is holding court. We soon find out that Dodd is the leader of a cult-like movement called The Cause, and as directionless as he is, Quell soon becomes part of the movement.<br /><br />Much has been made about whether this movie is a thin-veiled tale of/take on the Scientologist movement, but for me that is really besides the point. The movie instead focuses on the inter-relationship between Quell and Dodd, and at that, the movie truly shines. Yes, Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a great performance as the Cause leader, but Joaquin Phoenix simply blows everyone off the screen with his jaw-dropping performance. You may recall that he seemingly went off the deep end, and then some, in 2008-2009, captured in \\"I'm Still Here\\", only later to be revealed as just yet another performance. There are scenes in \\"The Master\\" that reveal/confirm Phoenix as being one of the best male actors of this time, check out the scene where he is jailed along with Hoffman, and Phoenix just goes beserk, just wow. As an aside for Radiohead fans, Jonny Greenwood scored the musical soundtrack (as he did in Anderson's 2007 \\"There Will Be Blood\\").<br /><br />The movie concludes on an open-ended note, and I suppose that is just right, as there can be no clear conclusion for these flawed characters. But more so than the story are the amazing performances in this movie. Besides the lead actors, Amy Adams also brings a steely, yet brilliant performance as the wife of Dodd. This movie is MILES away from your Hollywood standard fare. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ood standard fare. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B008XX6J92|5.0|I've been relatively happy with Streisand's quantity of releases in recent years and mostly happy with the last 2 releases of new material.  But they don't match the special quality of this album which covers so much of Barbra's life and development as an artist and person.  You can hear the different periods of time in Barbra's voice in this case making her the unexpected actress of her own life.<br /><br />The additional studio voices included between some tracks is a great touch.<br />This review is being written from the first listening point of view, in real time.<br />The clarity on vinyl is astounding!<br /><br />STREISAND:  RELEASE ME<br /><br />Being Good Isn't Good Enough - 1985<br /><br />Sweeping Streisand - a difficult melody but executed perfectly.

Great intro.<br /><br />Didn't We - 1970<br /><br />From the first three notes that open this recording, you are mesmerized by the instrument of Barbra's voice and the incredible control that she possesses.  After knowing the live version for all these years it was great to hear another version for comparison.  I love the energy of the live recording personally, but this is a grand Streisand period piece.<br /><br />Willow Weep For Me -1967<br /><br />This collection's playing order is not presented chronologically and that's fascinating.  Streisand's voice changed constantly and is still changing to this day.  The phrasing was much different in the late 60's Streisand voice and delivery was truer to early Broadway roots.  You hear that \\"Gotta Move\\" voice in this recording.  Works perfectly.<br /><br />Try To Win A Friend - 1977<br /><br />This would have fit perfectly on the \\"Superman\\" album, the sessions from which it is culled.  The growth in her delivery from less Broadway to more pop is amazing, and again, vocal control is incredible.  The actress had also grown as much as the person at this point, and Streisand was in a tremendous hot streak in 77.  A great relaxed recording again showing great versatility.<br /><br />I Think It's Gonna Rain Today - 1970<br /><br />The first of the songs released for the public to hear from this release, I initially was not a fan of this recording.  Almost too stark but fits where Barbra was in her recorded history.<br /><br />With One More Look At You - 1977<br /><br />This was the song that made me a Streisand fan originally, from \\"A Star Is Born\\".  I feel that the live version recorded on film has much more strength and passion - and that had Barbra rehearsed more for this recording, I'd like it more.  I love the lyric - and there are times the performance is nearly spot on with the film version, but the other variances seem uncomfortable a couple of times.  Great song, but suffers from a poor arrangement.<br /><br />Lost In Wonderland - 1968<br /><br />Vintage Streisand - as only she could really do at the time.  An original performance that showcases exactly why Streisand was like nothing anyone had ever seen before.  The arrangement is spectacular.<br />How Are Things In Glocca Morra? / Heather On The Hill - 1988<br />Would have fit in perfectly in any of the Broadway album series events.  Again, a spectacular vocal from Barbra - and I'm so happy to hear it.<br /><br />Mother And Child - 1973<br /><br />The elasticity of Barbra's voice here is amazing and I'm pretty sure one of her highest recorded notes.  I think it would have fit into the \\"Life Cycles Of A Woman\\" project well, but only conceptually.  The duet with herself, which worked so well on \\"One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home\\" does not come across as great as that piece of work did.<br /><br />If It's Meant To Be - 2011<br /><br />A shining gem of a tune, this Bergman tune left off of \\"What Matters Most\\" is a fantastic choice to plant on this collection.  Great performance and with it included of the flow of Barbra from nearly 40 years immediately before, you are psychologically reminded that this talent is still there and capable of doing what it has always done.  A great choice to include in this project.<br /><br />Home - 1985<br /><br />A song that has leaked out on bootlegs for a while, this version does include some additional recorded done in May of this 2012.  A great performance by Barbra - should have been on any of the Broadway series.  Nice to hear it updated and sounding as it should.<br /><br />Five Stars - really great, and Streisand fans will revel in it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a really fun game.  my son and I love to play it. I recommend it to anyone who likes arcades.
034580404X|1.0|This book was the most disgusting thing I have ever read.  It is not a love story, but rather a sex story, and an X-rated one at that.  I believe it is terrible our young impressionable children, teenagers and even innocent adults can be exposed to this type of perversion.  Can you imagine your son or daughter reading this trash and then attempting some of the things told in that book [perhaps on an unwilling participant??]  Shame on E.L. James.  Due to her perverted mind, I, nor many of my friends will never purchase another book written by her.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|A great way to kill time this game is very entertaining. Its a great rpg given that I'm playing it on a kindle. it has a few flaws but I heavily critique my rpg's.
B0085MNZ66|2.0|maybe it's because I can't sleep that is making this game not work for me ... it started out simple - I get the concept but then I ended up stumped on how to not mix colors on some boards ... there is no instructions - no tutorial - no explanation as how some of these boards are able to be completed ... can you jump the blank spots?? is there some trick to make the colors not blend??  I am very glad I did not pay for this - maybe with some sleep I will figure it out. I had no trouble downloading or playing the game on my kindle<br /><br />Update! I figured out where my brain wasn't getting it - it won't change my rating as this is a poor copy of other apps I have played. I will say, now that I figured it out better that the blending of the colors is an interesting addition to this type of game.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie in 3D.  There were several \\"wow\\" moments with stuff coming out of the screen, but more importantly the special effects overall were incredible and really put you in the action.<br /><br />There was a lot of humor for adults here and some of the one liners are true keepers.<br /><br />If you're up for some action, laughs and explosions, then look for further.  For a mere $19.99 you can own multiple disc versions of a great movie.  I think that's cheaper than any family of 3 would have paid when it was at the theatre.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is exactly what it says it is - with a twist from the special coins and prizes. it is stupid but so is the carny game!! it is a good time waster when you don't want to think.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|So I first heard a sampling of this CD through a online streaming station. everyime one of the songs would pop up i was always checking to see what it was from. So i checked out the entire CD. totally with the money. Very powerful songs.  If your a fan of soundtracks and scores this is a MUST HAVE
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it had good games but when I got to one I had 30 seconds to do the objective. most of them are easy, just a couple I cant get past.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is trully a masterpeice of drama mixture of suspense triller elements thrown into the movie.  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey did such an amazing job on this movie many scenes just made my jaw drop open and left me speechless.  Plus the music of Nine Inch Nails with the song Closer and Gravity Kills song Gulity enjoy those songs so much as I watched the movie.  So if you love your suspense triller movies with lots of drama thrown in then pick this movie up and watch it time and time again, or even with your buddies and watch and see the scenes that will make you speechless just like they did to me as I watched the movie.  But in closing no matter how much time passes it will forever remain a masterpeice of classic suspense trillers.

B0045HCJT4|5.0|The writer of the movie Soldier was excellent.  And the people who made the movie did not make any silly changes that would have destroyed the integrity of the work.  Kurt Russell was at that moment in his life when he was able to devote almost two years to working out several hours a day in the gym to get ready for this role.  Check out the scene where the settler family wake him up and he stands in the doorway looking SO BUFF!! heh  I also love the woman who played Kurt's friend.  She was also the beautiful Roman matron in Gladiator.  This woman makes men look good!  She is a wonderful actress and volumes go on without her even needing to speak.  I love the scene where she offers the medicine to a horribly wounded Kurt and gains his trust just by how she waits for him to accept it and the look on her face.  One other thing I love about this movie is that there is no soft porn scene - which every modern movie seems to feel compelled to include.  I call it the \\"obligatory sex scene\\" and always fast forward through it because, ... it's boring.
0316069884|5.0|This book was...well, woah.  It was an intense read that gives graphic detail (squeamish be warned).  I recommend it to ANYONE, vegan to carnivore.  If you're worried about an author who tries to shove vegetables down your throat, have no fears.  The self-entitled 'selective omnivore' is a friendly and relatable narrator.  I can honestly say, even though I knew about food processing before, this book totally changed my outlook.
B007ZH9P0C|5.0|Contrary to a few gloomy folks who are obviously misinformed, this song, along with \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" and \\"Turn up the Radio\\" all reached #1 on the billboard chart. Madonna has no \\"weak\\" songs and any naysayers are no true Madonna fans in my opinion. This, like all her songs, ROCKS! After 30 some years Madonna is still breaking records. MDNA has again appeared on the Billboard top 200 after dropping off. The concert is breaking records and making the album climb the charts again. It is being set to be certified Gold in the USA, FINALLY! I ADORE MADONNA!! And for those saying her career is over....She has now broken the record of Elvis Presley and The Beatles in #1 hit songs! The last three off her new album MDNA!! So to sum up....MADONNA STILL ROCKS!!!! And so does this single!!!
0525952926|4.0|This is the second book of Ken Follett's century trilogy, after Fall of Giants. Winter told the story of the second generation of main characters in Fall of Giants. New love stories, new conflicts, and all of them intermingled with the wars and politics of 30s and 40s. Follett is a master storyteller who has demonstrated his ability to build a web of story elements with many characters, through his previous bestsellers like Pillars, and World without Ends. Winter is a book as good as Fall of Giants, and as readable too. Once you passed first two chapters that paved the stages for the stories, 4 main plot lines in Germany, UK, US and Russia has extended. And it was hard to put it down.<br /><br />The only flaw in the book is that the characters were always at the right time, at the right place to witness the main historical event happening. Although it is great to see these events in the eyes of these characters, it makes the book a bit less convincing. This is the same problem happening to Falls of Giant. However, given the background of these characters, each of event could have happened. It's just that they all happened to these people who have been closely related is too much coincident.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent book, highly recommended, and people haven't read Fall of Giant should start from that book. Otherwise, you will miss some of the critical information that the book assuming readers already know.<br /><br />A solid 4 star. Among the best of historic novels in this decade. I will rank World with out End higher. World is the best among Follett books.<br /><br />I almost felt lost when I finished the book. Can't wait for the 3rd book. Hope I don't need to wait for 3 more years.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the book. There was never a dull chapter it stayed interesting. This book is a real page turning.
0525953728|5.0|With all the media induced controversy about this book, going in I wasn't sure how I felt about 'mark' writing this book.  After reading, I would have been disappointed he did not.  Amazing how my understanding of the events were so wrong.  Also appreciate a peek into a world I know little about.  If you are skeptical, read the prologue and then make up your mind.  Highly recommend.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This one, unlike other Reacher adventures was a fairly fast read. There were some improbabilities but I read primarily to see how Reacher handles himself and how he thinks through any situation he finds himself caught up in. I don't object to his decisions but am content to follow along and learn what he will do next. Reacher did not disappoint me in this story.<br />I am, however, disappointed to learn that Tom Cruise will be playing Reacher. I don't care about star power but want to see Reacher, who is a big man. According to an interview on his website, Lee Child accepts the moviemakers' artistic license but I don't. I'd much rather see Tom Selleck or a talented unknown play Reacher than to watch a movie that has scenes that have to be filmed from below to make Cruise look taller than he is. I suppose that's what they'll be doing. I also imagine that it'll be difficult to make Cruise come across as smart or as rough as Reacher is.

159315724X|4.0|Simon Sinek's \\"Start with Why\\" gave me the perfect solution to my frustration with the business plan terms of Mission and Vision. I have collected several corporate examples of Why to share with my customers. For example, Southwest Airlines' WHY is \\"provide affordable air travel to the average American\\".<br /><br />I lacked an easy way of explaining the difference in mission and why. Darren Hardy solved that for me on page 63 of The Compound Effect: If I invite you to walk a 10 inch by 30 foot board for $20, you'd likely do it. If I made the same offer but the board now connects two 100-story buildings, you'd likely not do it. But if the other building is on fire and your child is in it, you'd cross the board for free. The former is money-power. The latter is why-power.<br /><br />My other take-a-ways from this book include:<br />1. The person or organization with a clear, compelling and white-hot burning WHY will always defeat even the best who do HOW well.<br /><br />2. You will NEVER change your life until you do something daily.<br /><br />3. Routines are common amongst high achievers. Jack Nicklaus' pre-shot routine never varied more than 1-second.<br /><br />4. NEVER ask advice of someone whom you wouldn't want to trade places.<br /><br />5. Be the guy that says \\"NO\\". Don't go along with the crowd. Consistent with my life proverb \\"Success is NOT logical\\".<br /><br />6. Instead of stopping a bad habit, define something new to add to your life or business that is healthy.<br /><br />7. To stand out, send Thanksgiving cards, not Christmas cards. I bought some but believe it or not, they were very hard to find.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The trilogy is filled with explicit sex however the story of an abused little boy and how he tries to come to terms with a \\"normal\\" life is excellent.  The banter between Anatasia and Christian is filled with humor and her \\"inner goddess\\" is laugh-out-loud comical.  Very enjoyable!!
B006DHAT5K|3.0|In spite of its mixed messages about female sexuality, What's Your Number is surprisingly funny and even touching. Anna Faris plays Ally who hopes to find a date to her sister Daisy's (Ari Graynor) wedding. After reading that most women who have twenty or more sexual partners never settle down, she is determined that her next lay be \\"the one.\\" To prevent raising the number of men she's slept with, Ally enlists the help of her philandering neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) to track down her exes hoping they improved over time.<br /><br />One of the film's problems is its unintentional similarities to the superior Bridesmaids. The heroine has mixed feelings about a wedding, meets a man who encourages her to follow her artistic sensibilities, and struggles with unemployment. (\\"Struggles\\" is an overstatement; considering their financial situations, these characters have remarkable apartments.) Even the opening scene contains a gag that is nearly identical to one in Bridesmaids.<br /><br />Still, the movie is more irreverent and amusing than most romantic comedies. Farris is hilarious as Ally, a young woman who makes many mistakes but never runs out of optimism. Evans is fairly appealing as Colin, the obligatory rogue with a heart of gold. Since he admits that he can hardly spend time with a woman without trying to sleep with her, she doesn't consider him an option. Instead, she rendezvous with an assortment of ex-boyfriends and flings, played by a pleasing array of actors. A large part of the movie's appeal consists of her awkward interactions with men played by familiar faces such as Joel McHale, Chris Pratt, Zachary Quinto, Martin Freeman, and Anthony Mackie.<br /><br />The film also focuses on Ally's relationship with her family. She feels out of place with her more conventional sister and perfectly coiffed mother, in spite of their close relationships. All this, of course, channels towards her inevitable lesson about love and being herself. Many women will identify withher grapples with relationship advice, the media, and questions about a \\"normal\\" modern woman's sexual appetites. The movie touches on the thin line between giving someone a chance and trying to force a relationship.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie undermines some of its more progressive themes. It certainly includes sexist stereotypes, not to mention weightism. Ally is meant to be a disaster, but she often looks perfect and is shot sexually. (To be fair, Colin is naked throughout most of the movie.) When it comes down to it, though Ally doesn't fit into the film world, she is still a man's ideal woman. She isn't high maintenance, enjoys watching and playing sports (in one scene, she engages in a sexy one-on-one basketball game--in her underwear), and is up for almost anything.<br /><br />There are definitely moments where the film crosses the line into poor taste. The whole thing is difficult to take seriously. The \\"comedic\\" music makes the movie feel as though it should have a laugh track. But What's Your Number ultimately conveys the \\"life is messy: embrace it\\" message with (mostly) good-natured humor.
0393343405|3.0|This book was fun to read, I always love Western classical history, but its thesis is close to  nonsense.<br />  Stephen Greenblatt (a Professor for 30 years at my alma mater California Berkeley) greatly overstates the case that the discovery of ancient texts on philosophy somehow triggered the Renaissance  which led to the World 'becoming Modern'.<br />  in particular, he suggests the beginnings of the modern  world, built almost entirely of (Western) achievements in Science and technology, and the Economic Industrial revolution that followed them,  can be traced to  15th century finding of the Roman Lucretius descrition in the 'The Nature of Things' about the Greek Epicurus' ideals, among them:<br />*There is no Divine design, all religions are superstitious delusions,<br />*The Universe was not created for Humans,<br /> *Everything is made up of invisible particles and that<br />*the highest goal of human life is the enjoyment of pleasure and beauty, the minimization of pain, and<br />* the expression of wonder about things we do not understand.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br /> We wish the Modern world was so simple.  My view of Modernity is that humans, for the most part, are still intrinsically the same as they were 500 years ago but it SCIENCE and Engineering that have transformed the planet, understading disease, minimizing needless death,  so that the planet is now filled it with 7 billion people, who can connect with, entertain, educate, argue and yes, occasionally, kill the others.<br />  Isaac Newton was not inspired by Renaissance humanism, he was just a very devout Englishman who realized the laws of motion and Gravity.  The great scientists of the 19-20th centuries who understood quantum mechanics and the nature of the atom - to create Atomic bombs, computers and iPhones -  never needed to know that some Roman 2000 years ago had realized that all things are made up of invisible particles.  (many Sanskrit scholars from India will similarly tell you that the concept of the atom was mentioned there first - an equally disingenous claim).<br /><br />  Even the claims about the obvious limits of religion 'invariably cruel'  and the satisfaction that must be found in Science and wondering about the Nature of things - are not original, and not particularly revealing about the ultimate nature of modern man.<br />  In particular, I feel that the great challenge for humans - in the ancient or the modern world 2000 years later - lies in the NOT being  able to ACCEPT  what they already REALIZE, that the Universe is entirely indifferent to them - this could range from your loved ones not loving you back or a massive Asteroid taking out all life on Earth tomorrow.<br /> There is no Good or Evil - only ambiguities in between.  Here the certainties of Science do not help, because human beings cannot use it to accept what they may  have fully realized about their  pathetic, short lives.<br />  Paradoxically,  the Modern World then has only brought human limitations in to a sharper focus -  We know more about ourselves than we ever have, but still  unable to accept what typically bothers us most -  more or less the same place we probably were when Lucretius wrote 'The Nature of Things' - 2000 years ago.

B0068THAGY|5.0|Occasionally, I get challenged by someone about a review that involves a children's movie - as if there were some magical demarkation between that and crap. There isn't. If you can't see that simple fact, then you have my sympathy for having blunt perceptions and an apologist mentality.<br /><br />A good film is a good film - period. There isn't a golf handicap for movies; a special pass for marginal, ineffective or failure.<br /><br />There are numerous fantastic productions that are specifically geared toward children that are simultaneously amazing films. Think about it for a second.<br /><br />'[[ASIN:B005KQVDH8 The Goonies]]', '[[ASIN:B002ZCLH5S Explorers]]', '[[ASIN:B000VBJEFK Ratatouille]]', '[[ASIN:B000031EGV Jumanji]]', '[[ASIN:B0055B7IPE Up]]', '[[ASIN:B0034G4P4O The Adventures of Tintin]]', and the list goes on and on and on. And consider budget conscious or sublime productions which sacrifice nothing when it comes to quality storytelling: '[[ASIN:B004K00NN0 The Sandlot]]', '[[ASIN:B00005AUJS Hope and Glory]]', '[[ASIN:B0012Z361M The Red Balloon]]', etc.<br /><br />Again, funding isn't the issue. Quality in filmmaking is the key discussion every...single...time.<br /><br />So this question/challenge isn't about my adult perceptions. It's whether or not a film is a winner, middling, or just bites. It's not a fault for pointing out that [[ASIN:B008XBCJ34 The Emperor Has No Clothes]]. Why attack the messenger?<br /><br />This amazing and completely engaging film is a perfect example of quality with no discounts for being geared toward younger audiences. Just a flat out enjoyable, fully constructed, and deftly performed production that just happens to be a kid's flick. In the vein of 'E.T.', a movie whose magic of storytelling, childhood adventure and personal sacrifice will hopefully embed itself deep into the hearts of youths everywhere. A hopeful prediction: Thirty years from now and all those new middle-agers will fondly reminisce about Super 8 and how it affected their lives, changed it even. Very much like Star Wars did for many of my generation. Well, a hope anyway.<br /><br />The story opens with a gang of misfit teens and the tragic circumstances that begins a summer that no one will ever forget.<br /><br />It's 1979 and the small town of Lillian, Ohio is about to undergo an unimaginable trauma. Joseph Lamb is one of a quirky group of kids whose big dream is to win an amateur movie contest. But their innocent days end suddenly with the death of Joe's mother at the steel foundry. Now an only child, along with his devastated deputy sheriff father, they struggle to go on without the heart of their lives.<br /><br />Still, as kids will do, they try to forget. Not with malice, but because we all know that children are children for a reason. For them, life goes on. And Joe finds comfort helping his friends with the film project. So it comes as a double shock when he learns that his buddy, the conspicuously boisterous director, has finally found a girl to play the co-starring role in their zombie flick. Shocking, not only because he found a girl, by itself a noteworthy miracle. But because of who she is, or rather, who her father is in relation to Joe himself. He's the man indirectly responsible for his mother's death.<br /><br />But young Joe is insightful enough to understand that Alice wasn't at fault and smartly holds no ill feelings. That she's also the most beautiful girl in school also softens the surprise. So, newly installed as the lone female to the troupe of goofy buds, the gang rolls on, both literally and figuratively as the film becomes their summer adventure. Guerrilla moviemaking, using standing sets without permission, is pretty common for young directors and the gang is no different, taking advantage when and where they can - including an opportunity to film one night at the rail station. But it will be a night like no other.<br /><br />Collectively, they nearly all get killed in the process of accidentally capturing the spectacular train crash near the town limits. Having been so close to the explosive wreck, they're amazed to be alive. They're even more stunned to realize that someone intentionally crashed the millions of pounds of rolling steel stock. Bizarrely - it's someone they know - their school science teacher. And he's still alive.<br /><br />Soon the local authorities like Joe's dad are quickly supplanted by the military. And camouflaged US Air Force personnel carrying assault weapons and various strange gear appear on the scene.<br /><br />Something is terribly wrong.<br /><br />Things quickly spiral as more and more odd events begin to occur. All their dogs go missing. The power grid fluctuates with no explanation. Miles of transmission lines and microwave ovens disappear; even entire car engines are torn out of the bodies of vehicles. Worse yet, there are reports of people who have just vanished. As the town begins to realize these events can't be easily explained away - panic sets in.<br /><br />Yikes.<br /><br />An incredible film - period.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- When anyone challenges me to explain great acting - this is now the film I reference. The train sequence, as young Ellie Fanning switches 'on' her character. That is *exactly* what it means to be an actor.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- This was a reward for my hard work. I literally spent a solid year completely avoiding any review, comment or notation regarding this film. Trust me, in this Information Existence, this was no easy task.

Had absolutely no idea what the film was about, who it starred, or even what theme the film could be categorized in. Pure ignorant bliss. (a more appropriate term would've been 'flick virgin' - but that somehow seemed vulgar) &lt;g><br /><br />- \\"Just so you know - I'm massively stoned right now.\\"<br /><br />- \\"Drugs are so bad!\\"<br /><br />BWHAHAHAHA!

0439023521|4.0|Hunger Games is exceptionally well written with great character development, rich context of settings, expertly crafted dialogue and action; however, the actual story is awful and ferocious, as children are pitted in a fight to the death arena \\"Hunger Games\\" for the entertainment and utility of a futuristic oppressive government.  The children become killers in the arena engaging in brutal warfare against one another as they are spurred on by the evil \\"Gamemakers.\\"<br /><br />I can't believe that this book and series is promoted as teen genre. Although it obviously appeals to readers, it certainly conveys graphic, horrible killing and savagery to impressionable minds. I'm not so sure we want our children meditating on other children killing each other for the sport of adults. Unlike Narnia, LOTR and Harry Potter, this series so far lacks the good v. evil theme that is apparent and defined in the other series.  Here there is good amidst the evil but it is all in anarchy.<br /><br />A book is set in what appears to be a godless society; however, godly virtues persist among some members of the population. There are very moving and emotional scenes of virtue.  In this setting, where does the inspiration for virtues of love, sacrifice, loyalty and faithfulness come from? This seems to be a contradiction in the overall meta-narrative of the book, but on the other hand, maybe that is the point.<br /><br />This is an very entertaining book but the substance is also very troubling.
B0068MNO4S|4.0|***Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />This film struck very much the same chord as Oliver Stone's '[[ASIN:B004FQX59I JFK]]' - an extremely well-executed, high quality production that, if my read is correct, a consensus majority of academics and historians dismiss.<br /><br />I claim absolutely no insight into Elizabethan Politics and any struggle for the British throne four-hundred years ago, but simply judge this as a standalone production. Additionally, I have a zero stake in the on-going battle between Oxfordians and Shakespearean Traditionalists. So tossing academic molotov cocktails at my review gains you nothing. Jusy sayin'.<br /><br />'Anonymous' is a sumptuously crafted and textually rich film; one of the few movies where I can say I truly enjoyed this period of history without bloodshed. It's not populist opinion, but I tend to prefer modern interpretations of the Middle-Ages that involve a bit of bladework, shields, flails, and a truncheon mace or two. Not necessarily all-out warfare, but the 16th and 17th Centuries without plagues, fecal-filled streets and the occasional strutting wench tends to wear on my patience, 'The Tudors' notwithstanding.<br /><br />A superbly staged drama with fascinating suggestions of a lost history, illuminating several arguments and posits about the authorship of the works attributed to William Shakespeare. Again, this review simply addresses the film itself and not its place in history. There's real enchantment involved as Director Roland Emmerich deftly and completely pulls us into a time of political turmoil and royal intrigue - and punishment by death for any who dare expose or challenge its secrets.<br /><br />One of the court, Sir Edward De Vere, The Earl of Oxford, has for the entirety of his life disavowed his heritage - dodging court politics and avoiding fiscal endeavors. Why? Forced to suffocate his true calling - to write - he draws out his days with no effort to maintain his estates or manage his affairs. The passion he's forced to sublimate kills his sense of life, becoming listless, bored and withdrawn. But despite a lifelong effort to resist the urge of pen and quill, his passion overcomes his better sense; secretly reaching out to established playwright Ben Jonson, he makes a deal. Paid to be a cut-out, Jonson will front for the noble, allowing his words to be publicly fielded and enjoyed while the earl maintains his anonymity and proper societal standing.<br /><br />And that's how things would've stayed, except, a confluence in history is about to take place.<br /><br />As the rule of childless Elizabeth The First reaches its twilight, the battle for the throne of England dawns. And it's Sir Edward who stands at the nexus.<br /><br />With no legal heir, various factions begin to plot their choice for the throne. None more ambitious than Robert Cecil, prime counselor and advisor to the crown. A machiavellian plan put into action by the infamous humpbacked bureaucrat, intent on insuring his continued existence at court by installing a distaff cousin to Elizabeth as the heir apparent, circumventing her majesty's expressed wishes for his own benefit. Her isolation Cecil's greatest tool, as the hump whispers lies and half-truths in order to maintain control of the royal succession.<br /><br />His plan requires the removal of the one of the leading candidates, Sir Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl Of Essex. And guiltly by association, Sir Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton - unknown to all but three people - as the illegitimate child born of the union between Edward and Elizabeth.<br /><br />After the failure of a direct action assassination attempt, Cecil plots to have Robert and Henry accused of treason against crown and state.<br /><br />Cornered with no visible way out, the pair seek out Sir Edward for advice. Having insinuated himself to young Henry as a family friend and court ally, it's his sage wisdom that has guided his son over the years. And to save both from the executioner's block - he intends on exposing the treacherous plan to remove them from the line of succession.<br /><br />In a final bid to reach the queen's heart, Edward employs his only skill - the written word. Quickly producing \\"The Tragedy Of King Richard The Third\\" - a thinly disguised jab, scathing admonition and outright mockery of his hunched nemesis. Edward's plan is to inflame the populace, delivering vox populi, vox dei - as the people are already aware of the seedy dark manipulations to install James VI Of Scotland as their new king; a northern royal that many English feel is a foreign-born usurper only remotely related to the bloodline.<br /><br />However, his plans go awry with the unintentional interference by the angry and jealous proxy. Unaware of the larger game being played and hurt by Shakespeare's undeserved fame and accolades, Jonson inadvertently alerts the power brokers of De Vere's intentions. Outmaneuvered and outplayed by Cecil - the execution of the Earl Of Essex as a traitor means his efforts, both private and public, are dealt an unsurvivable blow. He's lost all. His attempt at saving the British crown for an Englishman, giving Henry a place at court, and preserving his legacy are utterly destroyed.<br /><br />All that remains are his words.<br /><br />Oh yes, almost forgot about William Shakespeare. In this proposed alternate history, an insipid and illiterate stage actor who bumbles into the secret of Sir Edward's playwright proxy. With moronic bravery born out of ignorance and avarice - grabs ahold of the notoriety, revels in the infamy and happily blackmails Sir Edward for hush money to maintain the popular pretense. That's it. A hack whom history should've placed as a footnote, instead stands at the illustrious center spotlight, heralded as the greatest English writer in history.<br /><br />And in the context of this production: Dramatic irony that Sir Edward would likely find quite amusing.er's block - he intends on exposing the treacherous plan to remove them from the line of succession.<br /><br />In a final bid to reach the queen's heart, Edward employs his only skill - the written word.

B008H6GH8I|2.0|As a fan of the Resident Evil series since the beginning, I was very disappointed here. Besides the fact it wasn't scary, or spooky, or even startling, it just came up short all around.<br /><br />The first thing I was really annoyed by in this movie is it doesn't go 5 minutes without having a lame scene that was obviously put in just for the benefit of people watching in 3D. Objects are thrown right at the screen and the whole movie slows down. Even when watching in 3D, this is just obnoxious and really breaks the atmosphere of the film. It happens in every hand to hand combat scene too, and I think it really takes away the awesomeness that could have happened in some of those scenes.<br /><br />The second really annoying thing was the abundance of lame one-liners our hero Leon spouts at random times. It made the entire movie feel cheap and corny.<br /><br />The third annoyance I found was, during the credits, it was playing scenes from Resident Evil 6.<br /><br />I won't even go too into the story and how crazy it was. Even compared to the live action Resident Evil movies, this one made very little sense.<br /><br />Lastly, and I mean this, *SPOILERS*<br /><br />There were barely any zombies?! It was pretty much an hour of one guy with the ability to control lickers using the lickers to fight a bunch of T-103 Tyrants. And Leon was there too. Roll Credits.

B004LROUNG|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and while not all of them have been quick,light, fun reading, The Litigators, is by far the best of his that I have read.  Before Litigators, the King of Torts, was my favorite, so I must have a love for Mass Tort Stories....  Each character of The Litigators had their own unique qualities and I found myself loving everything about them.  Looking forward to many more to come Mr. Grisham!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is an \\"easy\\" straight forward narrative that puts the spotlight on the physical and mental training endured by the highly selective candidates that ultimately earn Seal membership.  Although not a primary intent, this book depicts the immeasurable sacrifice each member of this elite brotherhood is required to make -- thus providing the readership with an elevated sense of appreciation of our military warriors.  Given the dedication and skills of these often unsung warriors, it was inevitable that Osama Bin Laden would pay the supreme price for his evil.
0375703764|4.0|Oftentimes when I run across a book thats heralded for its ingenuity or otherwise \\"ground-breaking\\" character, it comes with a certain level of pretension and self-awareness.<br />What Mark Danielewski has created, on the other hand, is a book free of such pretensions, and full of a vast and untouched array of original themes and characters.<br /><br />The book starts off with a rather ominous warning from the notably unreliable narrator, Johnny. This introduction, a warning against the contents and their risidual effects on whatever psyche that dares to delve into them, creates an almost immediate desire to do just that.<br />Such a play for curiosity seems almost unneccesary, as the book itself, overflowing with page-after-page of footnotes, faux celebrity interviews and Jonny's own oft-times non-linear and downright-unrelated tales of drunken debauchery, provide an interesting break to the scholarly tone of the main story. It's a sometimes needed break, and revealing tidbits that point at a much softer side are later revealed more fully in the contents of the back pages.<br /><br />Navidsons exploration haunts us with subtle horrors, peaking out from the seemingly mundane and slowly but steadily evolving into borderline Lovecraftian nightmares. It takes some time to build up to the true \\"horror\\" of the book, but the progress is worth it as the tagline of \\"psychological thriller\\" makes itself immediately apparent.<br /><br />The characterizations can breath a bit cliche, at points. Johnnys character, an artistically-inclined tattoo shop assistant, can come off a bit dry. At first glance he seems to fit the trope that most new horror stories give to their protagonists-<br />an outsider, a drifter, and almost always one with a tragic backstory, loosely arranged and built with the specific purpose of instant, poorly-developed depth.<br />But, like most of the characters (who all seem to fall victim to this first-impression) that too changes with the progression of the plot.<br /><br />Danielewski's pseudo-scholarly examination of the (possibly) non-existent film explored in The Navidson Exploration rings with an almost eerie realness. The reader gets the sense that what they have in their hands is a legitamite examination, rather than an attempt at forgery.<br />One of the many accolades that can be given to Danielewski's writing is the complete originality composed in the individual narrations. There is truly a sense that each character is their own, and never do the writing styles presented by the narrators become muddled or lacking of distinction.<br /><br />All in all, a difficult but worthwhile read.

B00338QENI|5.0|I am really looking forward to discussing this in book club.  I don't usually like non-fiction, but this was a great combination of real life science and drama.  I hope we have a good turnout for book club because I can't wait to hear what my friends thought about the doctors, scientists, Henrietta's family and the author.  In addition to the actors, the moral and ethical decisions as well as the intriguing scientific discoveries should provide plenty for discussion.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|I'm a long time A-team fan and I've been waiting 30 years for there to be an A-Team movie. Those of you who are also hardcore A-team fans know there's been a lot of rumors through the years.<br /><br />When this one came out, I was not eager to watch it. In fact, it took me all the way up until September 2012 to watch it and the reason was because of course I wanted original actors (or as many as there could be) and I really didn't have much confidence in these actors. I was immediately reassured when I saw Stephen J. Cannell's (RIP) name in the opening credits as a co-writer.<br /><br />I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was spot on except for one, and that was Hanibal's character. I know Liam Neeson is a great actor but he just didn't make a good Hanibal. Hanibal is a more calm, laid back and collected cat. He's almost effortless when he's working. I just didn't see that here.<br /><br />The others were great. Especially B.A.s character. Although what's up with all this \\"Bosco\\" stuff. His name is B.A. Not Bosco! And where's the gold?<br /><br />I have long wondered how they would do an A-Team movie. I mean... just an episode takes up nearly an hour and that's only one case. It'd be pretty boring if it was just one case handled in the movie but it wasn't. It was wall to wall action from start to finish. It was very suspenseful and exciting. It wasn't the same original story as the original A-team but heck, it's been 30 years, I'll cut them some slack on swapping out wars.<br /><br />This was a very good movie and I'd love a sequel.<br /><br />Just one little fun fact... wait until the very end of the credits for a nice little surprise that original A-Team fans will really like. I'm not talking about the extended version. The standard version has it. Wait for the end of the credits.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|The much anticipated Downton Abbey Special delivered the highlight of the Christmas TV viewing schedule in style. There was plenty of action with the central plot featuring Mr Bates on trial for murder at a time when convicted murderers were often hanged and the impact of this on the Downton Abbey household above and below stairs. However, there was a good measure of dramatic sub plots featuring blackmail, romance, ambition and betrayal - in fact all the things one would expect from Downton!<br /><br />This is probably the best ever episode of Downton Abbey so should definitely not be missed.<br /><br />The timescale here took us from the end of 1919 into the beginning of 1920 so this will be the starting point for Season 3 which should hit our screens later in 2012. Downton Abbey Series 1 attained critical acclaim and earned the series the title of the most popular costume drama since Brideshead Revisited almost 30 years ago - given the number of period dramas both ITV and BBC churn out this is quite an accolade. Reviews for Series 2 were more mixed although personally I really enjoyed it, but few would have had much to complain about with this two hour special. This has hopefully set the standard for Series 3 which we now know will include Shirley MacLaine. I cannot wait to see her playing opposite Maggie Smith!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its a really fun game to play and see how well people can draw lol I live the game love it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The much anticipated Downton Abbey Series 3 starts in Spring 1920, carrying on from the superb Christmas Special which was set over the 1919/20 holiday period.  The first episode picks up with Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley at last about to get hitched, but as usual there is quite a lot going on at Downton both above and below stairs and you just know that nothing is going to go smoothly.<br /><br />Shirley Maclaine makes her appearance as Martha Levinson, Lady Grantham's American mother. As usual, Violet, played by Maggie Smith manages to set the scene with some rather pithy comments.  Martha has no time for the stuffy English and their traditions and is not slow to voice her opinion.  Clearly she was introduced as a foil to Maggie Smith and the interplay between the two does work very well as one suspected it would.  Violet seems to manage to continue to dominate any scene she is in.<br /><br />There are plenty of dramatic moments in the new series, as life on the Downton estate returns to more as it was shown in the first series, before the First World War when it served as a convalescent home for injured servicemen.  However, there are new challenges for Downton in the post war period.  The interaction between the family and those that serve them `below stairs' continues to be a rich source of story lines for the script writers and is a major contribution to the success of the show.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is the most successful costume drama from British TV since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago - and this is quite an accolade as they produce a lot of this sort of drama in the UK.  Regular viewers of Downton will have been holding their breath wondering whether Series 3 could possibly keep up the very high standards of the previous episodes.  However, we need not have worried and few will be disappointed with the latest series.  You really wonder how far Downton can go - personally I would not be surprised if it runs up to the 1930s in due course so hopefully plenty to look forward to!  The really good news is that we know there will be a two hour Christmas Special in 2012 and although a fourth series has not yet been announced it will be very surprising if it does not follow.<br /><br />Although the UK issue of this DVD does not include the Christmas 2012 Special, it is very likely that the US one will - certainly the North American Series 2 DVD did include the 2011 Christmas Special.  US buyers would therefore be advised not to order the separate Christmas 2012 DVD until this point is clarified as they may well find it is included with Series 3.  The UK DVD also includes 68 minutes of extra features which one would expect that the US DVD will also include.  The special features are Downton Abbey in 1920, The Men of Downton Abbey, Two Weddings, an Interview with Shirley Maclaine and Behind the Scenes - The Cricket Match.opefully plenty to look forward to!

0307887898|3.0|The lean startup gives a lot of common-sense advice to entrepreneurs starting anew as well as teams within large companies wanting to operate somewhat independently. There are some concepts in the book - especially about identifying the correct metrics to help sustain the business - that one can apply in any context large or small. However, in trying to address such a large and varied audience, the scope is too generic and diluted. Also there are a lot of buzz phrases such as \\"vanity metrics\\", \\"disruptive innovation\\", etc. - all more or less fuzzily defined and repeatedly used for effect.<br /><br />If you are looking for a defined process to attain a sustainable, growing business, this book can serve as a starting point; then you would need to define exactly how to translate these principles to your specific case, which is what I guess the author intended. The author illustrates his principles with a lot of anecdotes and case studies, but I found them superficial - interesting, but not especially helpful if I were to start my own business.<br /><br />I found the writing style repetitive and self-serving, with too many references to the author's consultancy on the same topic. There are also a lot of annoying and pointless references to other chapters within the same book, such as \\"As you will see in Chapter 11, ...\\" or \\"As we saw in Chapter 2, ...\\" etc. This book could have been condensed into about half of its 290 pages, cutting out waste as it preaches.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend it as light reading if you like reading business self-help books - not sure about value for money though. I personally read a borrowed copy.

B0059XTUVI|4.0|I'd heard concerns that this movie wasn't as good as it could have been because too much time was spent showing Thatcher's mental instability at the end. But I think the way it was done, it worked, and I don't think too much was made of it. It was a unique way to tell the story of her life both internally, in terms of her deep love for her husband, and externally, where she didn't show her feelings.  I don't know if the \\"iron\\" lady is an appropriate analogy for Thatcher. Iron tends to mean strength to me, and I don't see strength in someone who is rigid, unyielding, and convinced she is right about everything.  Thatcher considered those who disagreed with her politics \\"too cowardly\\" to do what she believed must be done, and that is just massive invalidation of the opinions and expertise of others.  The movie is timely in that it shows the results of following the kind of political philosophy Thatcher shared with her friend Ronald Reagan and that is being advocated, though in more extreme form, by Romney and the Tea Party GOP these days. It shows what happens when you impose such politics on a country - the people rebel and Thatcher became the most hated prime minister of all time.  She would have been thrown out of office had she not had the sense to resign, although she was never able to be open to the positions of others. As offensive and poor-equipped to lead as she turned out to be, the sequences that show her hallucinating her husband's presence serve to bring out the vulnerable humanity in her, and far from being too much of an excursion into her mental instability, are what makes this a really great movie to watch.  The only thing that was missing, and a very big omission in my opinion, was to see what the response of the Royal Family was to Thatcher and her politics and to have some response from them. For that reason I gave it four instead of five stars.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I just watched my new Blu-Ray of THE AVENGERS, the box office blockbuster of the year. Are you kidding me? THIS was THE blockbuster of the year? Seriously? It is a cluttered vague incomplete line of story telling with a fair first half and gravely disappointing second half.  JOHN CARTER is light years a better sense of story and marvel of the imagination than this canon-blasting insanity of The Avengers. The movie-going public was duped. JOHN CARTER is a much better story and vastly superior made film. The comparisons are not even close. I've watched JOHN CARTER fifteen to twenty times. It is immaculate, and it is precise in every detail. It is better shot and better edited than The Avengers. Far more went into making JOHN CARTER, and it touches the culture and our civilization much more than what is assembled as an adventure of the super heroes. The musical score alone for JOHN CARTER is so superior, and it is definitely based on 'higher vibrations' and force of imagination that truly transports. I am comparing these two films as one was oversold, the other undersold. I've now read the first three of the John Carter of Mars stories, and while this screenplay is structured for film and does not follow exactly the \\"Princess of Mars\\" storyline, it captures the same \\"transport of the imagination\\" and all of the character identities, the landscape, the civilizations, and the realness of each of the story elements. The casting could not have been more perfect. What Burroughs has captured, and filmmakers put on screen, was a language (of Barsoom) that is entirely believable; and the storytelling of the film makes both the language and this world as real as the written word and as real as any language in the history (as I know it) of our world here. Blockbusters like The Avengers don't even come close to doing that, but they are readily 'sold' on the public and garnish the box office numbers to loosely 'edifiy' their film. JOHN CARTER has legs of it's own. And more. MY RIGHT ARMS!!! You have my metal,  John Carter!
B007TK77QE|5.0|Never having read an HP, I wasn't sure what to expect. What I found was a masterpiece, a huge panorama of a small village, peopled by the whole social spectrum. It's a wonderfully humane book with moments of great sadness and great humour.  It may be presumptuous to say about an author who has sold 450 million books, but she is truly an amazing writer.  So many people have described the sadness of leaving HP, but I'm sure that for many there will be no less sadness after leaving Pagford and its population of real (warts and all) characters.<br /><br />I think it's a mistake to judge this novel, as many have, as \\"a book by the author of HP\\", as though that was the extent of her range.  It's simply not.  It's a fine novel, even an important novel.<br /><br />The scene-setting may require a bit of work for the first 30 pages or so, but once this is done, the reader can enjoy an immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking book.
0525953728|4.0|This is a Great story, and contains some very interesting days in the life of a Navy Seal BUT it is hastily written and is so limited that it only asks more questions than it answers. It is VERY apparent that the author was writing it under extreme stress because of the National Security limits. I think he did an Excellent job of NOT telling secretes but it was definitely a rush writing and that is very apparent. I do appreciate him stepping up with this and commend him for taking this step.
0345803507|3.0|Third and last (thank god) in the Fifty Shades erotic romance trilogy revolving around Christine and Ana Grey.<br /><br />There are a couple of short stories at the end: \\"Fifty's First Christmas\\" is about the first Christmas Christian experiences with his new family while \\"Meet Fifty Shades\\" is Christian's side of his first meeting with Ana. Too bad James didn't come up with this when she first wrote [[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades Trilogy, #1)]].<br /><br />My Take<br />Of the three, this is probably the best written from a technical standpoint. It's also the most boring as it is essentially a \\"day in the life\\" and we trip along, la-la-lah, until the story is interrupted by a few dramas: Ray's car accident, a kidnapping, a pregnancy, and Kate's worries. Yes, we finally learn how Elena came into Christian's life and there's a tidy-up with a couple of old \\"girlfriends\\". Superfluous padding that serves to point up how easy it is to rile up Christian.<br /><br />We get to see Ana get a backbone and take action to protect her own. Unfortunately, the backbone is only partly accompanied by any maturity. She and Christian are fairly well matched in that they are mature in different areas so they can figure out how to balance the weaknesses of the other. If only they can match that balance with responsibility and understanding. They both are such children sometimes.<br /><br />James misses a number of opportunities to make this a better story. Taken as a whole, the Fifty Shades Trilogy falls down. I really enjoyed the first one as James played my emotions, caused me to empathize with her characters. The second was a disaster. As though James got too cocky and thought she could do without an editor. This one. The last is the equivalent of a broom and dustpan sweeping up the loose ends.<br /><br />I thought Ana was pretty stupid with her ultimatum to Christian. She knows how vulnerable he is. And she still hasn't matured enough to allow anyone to explain anything to her. She expects so much from Christian but isn't prepared to offer him the same. Admittedly, Christian has his own problems he needs to work on. But at least he tries which is more than I can say for her.<br /><br />Romance is blossoming on several fronts in this story. Besides Ana and Christian, that is.<br /><br />I do enjoy their emails!<br /><br />The Story<br />It's Christian and Ana's wedding day and we enjoy their honeymoon. It's their return to the real world with Ana wanting to continue to work even as Christian freaks out about her safety and Ana's desire for some independence that provides the excitement as they struggle to mesh their separate personalities into a couple.<br /><br />Ana has her issues with Christian's overly controlling nature with additional drama from Hyde as he pushes for his revenge on several fronts.<br /><br />It's Ana's surprising news that really brings their problems to a head.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Christian Grey is a self-made billionaire who has combined the control he learned from Elena Lincoln with his own innate intelligence to create his empire. Jason Taylor is his main security; he has a young daughter, Sophie, who lives with her mother. Ryan is additional security. Gail Jones is his housekeeper and she cooks during the week. The parents who adopted him are Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey and Carrick Grey. Elliot is his older brother who is involved with Ana's best friend, Kate, and Mia is his younger sister who is involved with Ethan, Kate's brother. Ros is his second-in-command at Grey Enterprises.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is the new Mrs. Grey and determined to continue with her career in book publishing at SIP. Nor does she want Christian to \\"give\\" her a job. Lucas Sawyer and Prescott are her security people. Ray Steele is Anna's stepfather and the man she considers Dad. Carla is her mother on her xth husband, although Bob seems to be a keeper. Jos&eacute; Rodriguez is her best friend from college, although he'd prefer to be more; Rodriguez Senior is his father.<br /><br />Gia Matteo is the architect who is revamping their new house and she has designs on Christian. Jack Hyde is Ana's former boss at SIP; Christian had him fired for sexual harassment of Ana when he tried to put the moves on Ana in [[ASIN:0345803493 Fifty Shades Darker (Fifty Shades Trilogy, #2)]]. Elizabeth is one of the editors at SIP. Hannah is Ana's secretary at SIP. Leila Williams is Grey's nutso former sub; Susannah is another.<br /><br />Detective Clark is handling the case. Dr. Greene is her gynecologist. Elena \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" Lincoln is the older woman who initiated Christian into the world of BDSM. Dr. John Flynn is Christian's psychiatrist.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover continues the theme of the black background shading into a speckled charcoal at the bottom. This time the featured image is a set of shiny new metal handcuffs--one of Ana's favorite toys. I can't help but think it would have been more appropriate for the handcuffs to be open, reflecting the title.<br /><br />The title is very accurate as Christine is Fifty Shades Freed, letting go of his secretiveness and acknowledging what has shaped him in the past.he'd prefer to be more; Rodriguez Senior is his father.<br /><br />Gia Matteo is the architect who is revamping their new house and she has designs on Christian.

0316228532|1.0|I tried soooooo hard to read this book.  After 60 pages, I gave up.  I really wanted to like it, as I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan, but alas, I could not.  I knew it wasn't going to be Harry Potter, but I didn't know it was going to be so unlikable.  The characters were all horrible people who I didn't care about.  There were long passages that made no sense.  I read them several times but never understood.  You practically need a dictionary to figure out what J.K. Rowling is saying.  I am an adult, but the foul launguage and crude sexual references were too much for me.  I couldn't figure out where the plot was or where the book was possibly going to I stopped reading.  I'm sorry to say it, but I think fans of J.K. Rowling are going to be let down! :(
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I suppose a lot of writers make my mistake: that assumption that submitting your manuscript to Kindle's conversion program means it reproduces said manuscript in the same carefully laid-out and polished form in which you finished it.<br />Well.<br />When I saw what really happened, my blood pressure spiked and I went looking for solutions, pronto. Enter Building Your Book for Kindle.<br />The little book saved my behind, kids, muy pronto...I might recommend that it be edited a tad more aggressively, for better brevity, but it works well as it stands.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|New review - 3D blu-ray (watched 12/7/2012): Ok, so the one thing I did enjoy in the original viewing was the visuals of the movie, and that was in 2D since I didn't want to drive farther and pay more to see the 3D version.  However, shortly after release on Blu-ray, Black Friday came and the studio was blowing these things out already for 12.99 and since I am a huge fan of 3D I bought it.  I have about the best setup for viewing 3D at home one can get: DLP Projector (No cross-talk, ghosting) bright lamp (1600 Lumens), highly reflective large screen (retro-reflective 1.8 Gain gray, 120 inches), and eye level projector placement (maximizes light output of projector returned to the viewers).  Also I have a 7.2 speaker setup so compared to the neighborhood cinemaplex I was guaranteed to have a better audio and visual experience.  It turned this turd into a &#34;watchable&#34; movie to the point that I can say I will re-watch it in the future - but always in 3D.  I'd revise to 1.5 stars but Amazon does not support that capability so it stays at 1!  You may have a better experience If you love Damon Lindelof's writing in general.  To me he's a hack that has no idea where his plots are going so leaves holes you can drive a semi through, then allows his viewers to make up whatever they want as the reasons and finally, he may even take those ideas and build them into the sequel or the next TV season.  Example: Here's what it would look like if Lindelof was writing the pivotal scene in Se7en:  Set scene: Freeman (Det. Somerset) chooses to leave the box closed while his partner Pitt (Det. Mills) waits. Pitt: &#34;What's in the box?&#34;  Freeman: &#34;Guess.&#34;  Pitt: &#34;Why don't you just tell me what's in the box?&#34;  Spacey (John Doe): &#34;Even I don't know. Remember Schrödinger's cat?&#34; End Movie.  Original Review: I went into the theater with zero expectations, and came out with poo on my shoe. I scraped it off, but the stench was imprinted on my brain. Luckily, in the aftermath of seeing Lethal Weapon 3 and 4, Alien 3 and 4, Matrix 2 and 3, and Star Wars ep. 1,2, and 3, I've trained myself well on how to do a &#34;mind wipe&#34;.  Now I'm getting more anxious about Jackson and his 2, strike that, 3 Hobbit movies... p.s., plenty of other reviewers have covered in depth all the reasons why this movie reeks, so I chose the more visceral route.

B005ZO6NRA|1.0|I grew up on Conan comics, so my perspective is biased in favor of this classic barbarian. That being said, this movie is simply terrible! While I must admit the actor playing the part of Conan of Cimmeria does do justice to the comic book illustrations, everything else - script, plot, acting, etc. - was an insult to die-hard fans. You will be better off watching the original with Arnold Schwarzenegger (at least you can excuse the short falls because of when it was made) . This was a lazy remake that, even though I saw it for free, leaves me feeling robbed - 113 minutes of my life I will never get back. Unless you are watching drunk / high, or you get a kick out of really bad movies, look elsewhere for worthy entertainment.

B004J64QSI|3.0|I prefer the 10th Anniv. edition (with Michael Ball as Marius, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, and Lea Salonga as Eponine), but this edition was tolerable and most people will be happy with this one.  Nick Jonas performed as Marius well enough, but he was clearly out of his element and not up to the vocal quality of the rest of the cast; but he could easily serve as the celebrity professional guest star as Marius in a high school or community college production where he would shine.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|This is a very good representation of a supertramp concert, a good selection of songs, well played and very enjoyable. The video quality is not super high def. but i don't think it detracts from the concert. The surround mix could be better, but it is still very acceptable.

B0085MNZ66|2.0|Like others said, no instructions, tutorial or help menu, and I also gave up at level 6. (If someone's figured it out please tell me.) In order to undo you have to drag up the Kindle menu and use the back arrow  which is annoying -- there's no reason they couldn't have &quot;undo&quot; and &quot;reset&quot; buttons on the actual gameboard.<br />  On one of the levels I unlocked the &quot;science bonus&quot;, but have no clue what that did. I went to the Bonus page and there a bunch of irregularly shaped unmarked boxes; clicking on them did nothing. If you click on Science it takes FOREVER to update the page, and then the only change is the colored circles become squares. I suspect that using Science mode might use the rules for combining light rather than paint, but the game certainly doesn't explain it.<br />  This was just a frustrating game to play, even for just the first 6 levels. Also, the second picture in the Photos section is incorrect! If you try to connect the blue to green, it'll turn gray by passing through the violet.  Why would they demonstrate the game with an incorrect screenshot?

0316228532|3.0|(2.5 stars) Focusing on life in the very small community of Pagford, perhaps similar to the small communities Rowling herself knew as a child in Gloucestershire, Rowling emphasizes the pettiness, the rivalries, the back-biting, and the cruelties of \\"ordinary\\" life as people try to cope with the messiness of existence as it unfolds. There is no magic here to offer any hope of change, no wizard to sweep down and offer aid, either to the characters or to the reader, and as the action progresses, with its focus on the unpleasant and often violent aspects of many lives, the reader is forced to examine the elements of chance which can devastate everything that one might dream of.<br /><br />Barry Fairbrother, a banker in his early forties, dies of an undiagnosed aneurism at the outset of the novel, a victim of a genetic defect. He leaves behind a wife and four children- and creates a \\"casual vacancy\\" on the Parish Council, which governs the community. Sixteen Council members deal with a variety of community issues, including the proposal to separate an area of Pagford called the Fields from the rest of this picturesque community and make it the responsibility of Yarvil, the more industrialized community which is its neighbor. A second issue involves the closure of a drug rehab facility located near the Fields, from which most of its clients are drawn. These clients are a financial and social burden for Pagford, since they vandalize bus stations, streetlights, footpaths and public seating, all of which must be maintained by Pagford. Inhabiting low-cost housing, these residents are also viewed as belonging to a completely different social class - lower economic level, less education, less sense of social responsibility, and somehow less worthy of the efforts by Pagford's citizens.<br /><br />Rowling introduces over thirty characters in the first fifty pages of the book, providing enough brief but specific descriptions for each character to participate in the plot, which quickly unfolds on several levels of simultaneous conflict. Husbands and wives fight, spouses fight with their lovers, children and parents fight, teenagers fight with each other (sometimes resorting to bullying on the internet), teenagers fight with teachers, and two children fight simply for survival. The issues relating to the \\"casual vacancy\\" on the Council create even more conflict.<br /><br />The style which was so effective for Rowling when she was writing Harry Potter is less effective in this \\"adult\\" novel. Some characters are memorable for some aspects of their characters without being unique, while on the level of plot, the conflicts and crises, based on real life, are already familiar to devoted readers of contemporary fiction and often feel trite. At five hundred pages, this novel gave Rowling many opportunities to introduce broad themes and develop them with sophistication and attention to universal values. Instead, she gives us a long novel which is sometimes exciting on the limited level of plot, but which remains on that limited level, never soaring into broader realms of wider scope. The characters here sometimes feel like paper dolls, limited by their rather stereotyped depictions, while their sheer numbers prevent the author from developing subtleties that make them come alive.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|No, really. Signals was about technology throughout and this one is about life's journeys. Signals has always been my favorite album by cohesiveness alone but this one is now second. I loved Vapor Trails for the first few years of it but I finally agreed that it had sound issues. Snakes and Arrows, I tried to like it and thought I really did but now, Clockwork Angels has surpassed both by miles. The sound is back and the songwriting and the essence of Rush is back. Everything a Rush album should be, this one takes the cake. They even surprised everybody with several great ballads. Honestly, the only ones I skip(not because they are not good songs but because of the sound)are Caravan and BU2B. Too harsh sounding, IMO. They corrected that with the balanced sound of \\"Clockwork angels\\" the song. And the rest of the songs flow perfectly after that.<br /><br />Rush has done it right this time, again.

0062183591|4.0|What I liked about this book is that Ariely beautifully engages you along the chapters on different aspects of human behavior in regard to honesty and dishonesty. The book is obviously enriched with and backed by data and an impressive number of experiments in this field. I'd really like him to do some experiments and write something on psychology and politics, the major components of politicians' behavior, and the relationship between psychopathy and politics.

B0096YBEIS|4.0|Like many reviewers I am a long term fan of the group,both collectively and sigularly. My feelings about this album is that it is very smooooth.It is a great listening album, with the influences of each member can easily be heard. Being a big fan of Chuck Loeb,I'm pleased with how he has been able to integrate himself into the band. While I'm not a big fan of his wife Carmen Questa,his influence has led the band in a different direction,which is just great. The hub sill remains Bob James,one of the finest musicians of our generation. For this band to last 20 years and still evolve is a testament to him and the real pros who have contributed over the years.I'm sure there will be some who will pan this album. Don't listen to them!

B008JJM88Q|5.0|this app is amazing. its so ironic how it actually works and the genie can guess anyone your thinking whether their real or fiction! &amp; the majority of the times its correct :) I cant stop playing sometimes ; I recommend this .. you'll be surprised!
B008UTV6S8|4.0|I've been a fan of Paul since childhood. Despite that, I consider myself hard to please in terms of Paul Simon albums. Because I respect Paul's work so much, my expectations are high. I have to say, my high expectations are mostly exceeded by this live album. It's an amazing set of music, played with the verve (and speed, on many of the cuts!) of much younger cats.<br /><br />First, the set list is amazing. What other pop/rock musician but Dylan has produced an album in his 5th decade of performing that can match Simon's 2011 album \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\"? That achievement is recognized with four live cuts here - noticably, twice as many as the Simon & Garfunkel-era tunes included. Elsewhere, there's at least one cut from all of his studio albums. (The exceptions being Songs From The Capeman, She's The One, and Surprise, the first two of which I'm happy to see ignored.)<br /><br />Many highlights emerge, but my favorite is \\"The Afterlife.\\" It's such a low-down groove, it threatened to blow up my sound system just now. The sound on the album in general, in fact, is so good, I wonder if there was some post-live tweaking. If they played every note of this live, I'm amazed.<br /><br />Most of the set is very upbeat. Mr. Simon seems focused on a) not relying on his Simon & Garfunkel past, and b) not allowing himself to be pigeonholed as a \\"soft-spoken acoustic singer/songwriter,\\" which is probably still how much of America thinks of him. He seems eager to present himself as musically alert and vibrant. And he succeeds.<br /><br />This is also the best \\"live Paul Simon\\" album available, it should be noted - with the exception of the Simon & Garfunkel reunion album from 2003, \\"Old Friends\\" - [[ASIN:B00064VQBM Old Friends Live on Stage (2 CD)]] - which I still play quite often.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's adoptive brother Loki from subjugating Earth. You see, Loki makes a deal with the leader of the Chitauri. In exchange for getting the Tesseract(an energy source with unlimited potential) for them, the leader of the Chitauri promises Loki a Chitauri army with which he can enslave the Earth with.<br /><br />I was wildly skeptical about this movie, truth be known. Despite the fact the movie received rave reviews and made billions at the box office, I didn't think Joss Whedon could pull off a convincing Avengers movie, regardless of what people thought. There was too many variables there with which, to tie together, to make a good movie without someone getting the short end of the stick on screentime. I figured this movie would be like The Transformers, Battleship or something of the like and have tons of explosions and pointless action sequences, making it not amount to much. Although it did have both, it was never pointless. Whedon actually pulled off a cohesive & convincing Avengers movie. It was, definitely, no Dark Knight movie but it wasn't intended to be. I was quite impressed with it because it turned out to be nothing like I expected The Avengers movie to be. I was given something completely different and I really liked that.<br /><br />I only have two gripes with the movie and they're small gripes. First, the movie started off a bit slow. When I expected it to pick up its' pace a little bit, it just lulled there yet, by the second hour, it started its' gallop into an all-out running up to the end. If I had of blinked, I would've missed some great parts in the movie. Second, I was somewhat disapointed at how they changed everyones' outfits. Especially, Captain America and Thor's outfits.  Change is constant, I know, but why mess with something that-previously- was nearly perfect for them. I really liked the Kevlar look of Cap's previous outfit. Oh well- you can't have everything you want, I guess.<br /><br />Marvel's The Avengers is, without a doubt, a great piece of cinematic history. It makes me wonder, now, just how Warner Brothers plans on pulling off its' Justice League movie. I enjoyed The Avengers movie and really really look forward to next chapter in their ongoing saga. Was that really &#60;Spoiler Alert&#62; Thanos I saw grinning an evil grin at th end of the movie? Whether you're a comic book fan, or an action fan; you'll find lots to love about this movie. &#60;Thumbs up&#62;the Kevlar look of Cap's previous outfit.

B008I3QZKU|4.0|My husband and I are huge Killers fans and we pretty much just have one of their earlier albums playing in our vehicle 24/7. So we were stoked when Battle Born was released.<br /><br />At first listen, I was disappointed. On the surface, it's not quite as catchy or edgy. It's a bit toned down from their previous material, in my opinion.<br /><br />However, three or four more go-rounds with it in the car and I'm a fan. Is it their best album overall? Not quite. A little too much synth for my tastes. (Honestly, it sounds more like another Brandon Flowers solo album than the Killers, which isn't at all bad thing--just unexpected). But it's great, and a few of the songs definitely rank up there with the best of them. Brandon Flowers' voice sounds better too.<br /><br />My favorite: \\"Runaways\\", \\"The Way it Was\\", and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb.\\"
B0085MNZ66|5.0|this game is really fun any one out there should play okay please just play I swear it is really really fun bye oh 5 star review

1476712042|5.0|This book completely sucked me in from the first few pages. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a book as much as this one. It was a breath of fresh air for me. I loved Travis and Abbys story. I hope you do too!

B000JIHP88|1.0|We are sooo disappointed and upset.  As a child, I grew up with Fisher Price.  In fact, as an artist, I have even incorporated the classical toys in my Motel Series paintings; however, their quality has gone to the toilet.  :(<br /><br />We purchased this mobil for our baby as she has had sever acid reflux and we were hoping it would help soothe her.  It DID!  She LOVED to watch the animals go round and round in the little increments of time that allowed her to be at her 30 degree recline... This all lasted less than a MONTH!  :(  :(<br /><br />Not only are we angry about the consumer \\"rip off\\" we are also VERY angry about the WASTE that will go to the landfills.  SHAME ON FISHER PRICE for making such a crappy, throw away product.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book is good but is very limited on details.  Lone Survivor is 10x better.  Very quick and easy read
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Nothing you expect to happen, happens. Read it. Keeps you thinking and turning the page over and over.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What an awful book... badly written and just plain dull... I read it because I was curious about all the hype.... wished I hadn't now
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Simple game that is good for wasting time when you want to be mindlessly entertained. I unwind with it after work until I run out of coins.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was an enjoyable film that I wanted to see in the theater. Glad that Amazon had it for rent. I would recommend it to anyone that missed it.

Bush just didn't want to tell the world this because they needed a reason to keep us in the middle east.<br />This book is complete fiction and was written as a CIA coverup story.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|The Kindle ESV Study Bible is easy to use and to navigate through. There is a wealth of information which is easily accessed. Study notes and concordance references have hot buttons within the text, so can be read easily and then return to the passage being studied.  The supporting material (maps, charts, graphs, etc.) are very good and the ability to zoom the maps is quite nice. This bible contains the most information of any I have read, which combined with ease of navigation makes it the most useful. I do recommend the use of a stylus over ones finger.
034580404X|5.0|I bought the trilogy of 50 Shades.  I loved every minute of reading and didn't want it to end.  The characters of the book are ever present on my mind and in my sub concious.  I'm not usually much of a reader but these books captured my intrest and the story line kept me coming back for more!!

B0058VA2U4|5.0|WORSHIP MUSIC is one of the best moments from the legendary HARDCORE THRASH METAL band ANTHRAX!!!!!! The return of Joey Belladona to the vocals is one thing i gotta notice...Joey NEVER sounded BETTER!!!!! IT's AMAZING!!!! and the songs are the classic ANTHRAX style with a modern feeling, that creates a unique new MODERN MASTERPIECE!!!!! EARTH ON HELL, THE DEVIL YOU KNOW, IN THE END, THE GIANT and JUDAS PRIEST are among ANTHRAX best tunes.... if you liked old classics with Joey like AMONG THE LIVING, SPREADING THE DISEASE and PERSISTENCE OF TIME, you will love WORSHIP MUSIC!!!!!

WELL DONE, ANTHRAX!!!! BRAVO!!!!!
1476712042|5.0|I loved, loved, loved \\"Beautiful Disaster\\"! Well written. Both romantic and a little heartbreaking at the same time. I highly recomend this to anyone looking for an addictive read.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|Yes, it could use some instructions, but isn't trying to figure out a game just as much of a fun challenge as the game itself? IMO that's part of what makes for a great game.<br /><br />Works perfectly on my Galaxy Nexus,  JB Sourcery rom
B005CRQ2IU|3.0|After 25 years this book remains fresh and vital. It plays more as a period piece written in contemporary times. The story is a compelling one, a page turner, but also one that leads the reader to reflection upon the multitude  of viewpoints through which we learn the whole tale.<br />This book is at the top of everyone's list , and deservedly so, with thousands of reviews praising its excellence.<br />I love this book.<br />However, the dismal performance of the kindle app in delivering this ebook is appalling. The download was woefully slow. Panel view is either non-functional  or nonexistent, which is particularly galling as the strict grid layout of this book would seem to be made for this feature. There is even no manual zoom function.<br />On the plus side the app does keep track of which page I'm on.<br />My disappointment with the performance of the app with this book will influence my future purchases.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm enjoying this game a lot,  it keeps me occupied during work . I recommend it to anyone who wants to pass time during the day
B008JDAC7G|5.0|buy this you will not regret it! not sure how i got it for .25, rock on!  fun and well put together.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I love this app. It runs great on my kindle fire. I find myself saying &quot;just one more&quot; and the next thing I know, an hour has gone by. I'd say you can only stump the genie about 5% of the time...it really is amazing how many characters it can figure out- and not just current figures in the news or popular culture.<br />My son in college also downloaded this app and he and his friends have a great time wasting time with it.

0385344333|1.0|Child's recent novels are so darn inconsistent.  I really enjoyed his previous novel, The Affair.  Intriguing plot and interesting characters.  Of course it followed Reacher in his early days when he was a young whippersnapper.  As reluctant as I am to broach the subject, it may be time for Jack to apply for Social Security.  Wanted Man reminded me a lot of Nothing to Lose where the only thing I lost was my valuable time reading about Reacher walking between Hope and Despair for about 300 pages.  This time instead of walking, he is driving in a car all over Nebraska and Kansas and everything seems to occur at night. Hate to say it but this is a really boring read.  And for the life of me, I still don't understand the threat posed by the terrorists.  Something about banking credits that could be called upon at any point in time. Ludicrous. And let us not forget the importance of blue dots on the doors in the terrorists' hideout. I do agree with one of the other reviewers that in fact Sorenson's character was far more interesting than that of Jack. Anyhow, hope springs eternal and let us maintain faith that Lee gets down to business and puts in some real effort for the next Reacher saga. Caveat emptor.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Powerfully written and well told.  Fans of the show will enjoy it regardless of which they delve into first.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's highly addictive fun, and fortunately I do not think it ends and that also means you can never be too good. I think it's a good game as well as challenging I can not think of anything bad to say.
B0030B624E|5.0|This movie is way too funny to be a 'scary' zombie flick.  Well done, and gross enough to be fun....
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I was impressed with this app.  It was easy to understand and I was very happy with it.  Thank you.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Another great story by David Baldacci. I'd finish a chapter and have to go to the next even though my eyes were telling me it was time to fall asleep. A good story of the lengths a person will go for the almighty dollar. Money is the root of all evil would be another good title of this book.
1612680011|5.0|I read this book a few years ago as an ebook. As with all the books I really enjoy I wanted to have a hard copy along with my kindle version. If you're a parent you HAVE to read this book. It will help you in how to discuss and teach your children about money. And if you don't have any children it's still very relevant for you. It's an easy read, written in a story format about the author growing up. Don't buy that Starbucks coffee tomorrow, but this book today.

0984183523|5.0|Thank you very much Victor for your book!<br /><br />OFFERS UNIQUE INSIGHT AND ADVICE<br />This book offers unique insight and advice on case interviews within the management consulting industry.<br />It's quite easy to read, as it's written in a very conversational tone.<br /><br />I'D LIKE MORE INFO ON PROXIES<br />I wish though that it contained more information on what Victor calls \\"proxies\\",i.e. references and/or assumptions from which to build on, such as the number of NYC inhabitants. Useful information regarding proxies in management consulting could be around: types, guidelines and how to collect/compile them (e.g. from trade associations, websites).<br />So, to complement Victor's book on this topic, I'd suggest the book Guesstimation - http://www.amazon.com/Guesstimation-Solving-Worlds-Problems-Cocktail/dp/0691129495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1348877559&sr=8-1&keywords=guesstimation.

B007TK77QE|1.0|21$ the price of kindle edition????? Why??????<br />Why on earth would anyone buy this book? Is it made of gold?????
0385344333|3.0|We all love Jack Reacher who is the quintessential American antihero.  We even miss the man he used to be but I haven't loved the last two books.  Maybe Lee Child is just worn out with our favorite protagonist, Jack and his yearly adventure.  In the last two novels it seems that the plot lines are either less than intriguing ('The Affair') or bog down at the end ('Wanted Man').  I hope Mr. Child just needs to take a two year break to think of something else or go on an adventure himself.  I hate to say goodbye to such a different hero but it seems our time together is running out.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love having this app for my kindle fire...but it usually takes a couple of failed tries before it loads up. It also tends to freeze on me too while I'm using it, too. Other than those issues, it's a must have app for all pinners.

B005LAJ1H2|4.0|Edit of review below: Question to Amazon. I bought this DVD set from Amazon. Disc 5 is flawed, as noted in the review. How do I get Amazon to replace the flawed disc??? Thanks for attending to my request.  --  Herman Trotter (Amazon customer)<br /><br />We love the series and think the text, casting, acting and direction - even the incidental music - are wonderful.<br /><br />  But in our copy of Season 2, Disc No. 5 was flawed and would not eject from our DVD player. We tried every day for more than a week, but while we could hear the eject mechanism running and trying to send the disc out, nothing happened. On the 10th day, having made our player unusable for all that time, it miraculously  ejected and we could see flaws on the playing which were probably the reason for all the problems. Could you replace this flawed Disc 5 for us????
B006QVRX9S|5.0|I bought this CD and t-shirt set for my mom for one of her birthday gifts.  She enjoys it.  The CD has all her favorite Beach Boys songs and then some.  I found myself liking a few of the songs I'd either forgotten about or wasn't very familiar with.  The shirt is a very bright yellow, which is cool.  She plays the CD a lot, and she said she will probably use the shirt to sleep in as it is a little too big for her.<br /><br />I think it's a nice set for casual fans, and collectors might want it even if they have all the songs already.
B008Y6WPXC|2.0|If you loved \\"The A Team\\", you'll love this movie. Cartoon like characters, dialogue straight out of \\"He Man\\", zillions of rounds fired with the good guys relatively unscathed and girls who dig it when a fella can put the smack down on a small gang made me look for B.A. or Face to show up in the black van.<br /><br />  The plot was of course ridiculous. When first you, like me, find yourself saying \\"wait, that can't happen ...\\", understand this will occur to you untold more times and let it go man, just let it go.<br /><br />  The 40 to 65 year old characters' personalities and actions would embarrass any self respecting pubescent teen. \\"Granddad why are you getting a skull tattoo\\"?<br /><br />  As a complete movie \\"The Expendables\\" is sub par, 2 stars at best.<br /><br />  To be fair, if the plot, characters, dialogue and believability are not important to you, and your demands are impervious heroes full of machismo ducking thousands of rounds while things go boom, this may just be your kind of film.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use and very quick to sync across all of my devices!! I use it all the time for both short term reminders and long term lists.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|have made a mental note never to purchase another book written by this author.  The dialogues between protaganonists are unlikely and stilted and the story lines are unreal.  Never again and certainly not at the premium prices charged by this author's publisher.

B005P06AAO|5.0|I have nothing negative to say about Season One. Buying it totally beats watching all the commercials on MTV.com. It still has the bleeping of the words that's slightly annoying but other than that it's great! Shipped quick too!

1565114205|2.0|As a sales manager who manages a team of sales people, I have learned that in today's sales environment, consultative selling is the only edge you have over your competition. Traditional sales techniques do not work as effectively and are outdated. I give \\"Spin Selling\\" 2 stars for scratching the surface on consultative selling. The only thing that kept me listening to the audiobook was hoping to hear something I hadn't already learned from the Sandler Selling System. It didn't happen. I suggest buying, \\"You Can't Teach A Kid To Ride A Bike At A Seminar\\" The Sandler Sales Institute's 7-Step System For Successful Selling By David H. Sandler. You will be glad you did and you may want to buy your sales force a copy as well. If you are serious about being the best you can be in sales and eliminate many of the things that turn sales into an emotionally challenging job, Sandler explains how. Please note: I DO NOT work for Sandler and have no horse in that race. This is just objective, solid advise that amazes most people like myself, when they discover the well kept secret of Sandler. But really, we don't want too many sales people using Sandler, especially the competition!

B0081HLM2E|4.0|Well crafted, creative and intelligent movies tend to more often than not come out of those northern Scandinavian cold, dark climes. Must be those winters.<br /><br />Plot: Story revolves around a professional corporate talent recruiter who also sidelights as an art thief meant to gain extra income that his insecurities and self doubts require, he believes, to support a trophy wife. Things, as you can imagine, don't always go as planned and add to that the additional twisty complication of, \\"Just who is doing the hunting?\\"<br /><br />Criticism: For English audiences that have to follow subtitling and scenic nuances at the same time; some of the subtleties and twists may be missed or difficult to follow. I had to go back a second time and view the critical near last scene to resolve some inconsistencies. Also, probably due to editing, and a bit to scripting, the character development and general flow of the movie seemed uneven, rough or rocky at times. The ending, in particular, seemed rushed and some loose ends still seem loose.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Absolutely pathetic attempt at adult fiction from J K Rowling. I purchased the book, read about 50 pages and trashed it (returned the book). Rowling has gone overboard with foul language to set herself apart from the kid's book style of the excellent Harry Potter series. The setting is horrible, characters boring and storyline will put you to sleep. The dialogues go on and on talking drivel about the same topic for 30 pages. Useless trash. I vow never to read another Rowling book just because of the way she has deviated from her strengths in this misguided attempt. Waste of time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book in my book club and was frankly very surprised at the turn it took as I had not read anything about it prior to ordering it on my Kindle.  The whole book surprised me.  It is not an eloquent book but it held my interest nonetheless.  It is contemporary, almost trite, but the dialog is [[ASIN:B006LSZECO Gone Girl: A Novel]]believable.  The ending though disappointing was probably an accurate reflection of highly dysfunctional and bizarre relationships.  I recommend the book for a light beach read.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|A fun dungeon crawler, but if you don't want to buy extra weapons and items it can take some repetitive grinding to get equipment good enough to progress in later levels
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This series continues to have great acting and marvelous suspense (what will happen next?) In some ways,this show is like a Greek tragedy and the family dynamics are riveting. One can only wait with baited breath for Season 5-where do we go from here?
B008FTAAG2|4.0|A couple years ago I was trying to find a female vocalist that could do it all from hard core to soft textures.  This album, Blood, continues to  show this band can still bring it.  There are only two songs I don't listen to on it but am very satisfied with their work on this one overall.  She has an amazing voice and shows she can keep up with the best of them.  To truly understand this band and understand their true potential I would highly recommend their other albums as well.  After hearing Maria's voice you'll understand.  She has a way about her that will keep you wanting more...

B000W93CHC|1.0|Absolutely a waste of time. Was a watered down recycled version of the first book  Insultingly repetitive and lacking any new themes, I felt angry at myself for having wasted both my time and my money on this book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I read a lot of the 1 star reviews and I was just bewildered how people can have a problem with this movie. Christian or not, the point is clear: men should love their wives and kids. Period. How could anyone have a problem with that?<br /><br />This movie is obviously done on a smaller budget. I get that, but I don't care. They did a great job considering what they spent. Even more impressive, then, is the number of lives being impacted by such a small budget.<br /><br />I'm reminded of the old hymn that says, \\"Little is much when God is in it.\\"
B008602KQI|5.0|If you haven't read the book yet, this movie is great.  If you read the book, or like me the whole series, multiple times, you will think the movie is good but really wish that the movie that you created in your head while reading the book was available instead!

B0086700CM|2.0|this game is a little fun at first but gets very boring after a while. I do not recommend it.
B008CP93S0|3.0|There's one thing about Hollywood movies that never stops throwing me: cleverly conceived story ideas whose characters and twists carry at least a germ of plausibility are suddenly freighted, at the midpoint, with contrivances and stock situations that derail their charm and turn the movie back into a conventional plot-driven vehicle.<br /><br />Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are both as funny as we know they can be -- and the screenplay does a fine job of giving them a credible (and even hilarious) reason for ending up in the commune where most of the movie unfolds.  It was also quite witty to cast Alan Alda as the aging hippy who owns the place.  Eventually, though, the movie's plot twists get a bit hokey and the story of a New York couple forced by straitened circumstances to flee the city (and with it the materialist responsibilities of the rat race) to \\"discover themselves\\" becomes encumbered by stock situations and villainies.  Basically it runs out of gas.<br /><br />Still, we downloaded it for $1.99 and at that price it was well worth it.  One last thing: there's some surprisingly dirty language and situations.  They didn't bother me or my wife, but if you were entertaining the idea of watching *Wanderlust* with your kids (I was personally grateful my 15-year-old daughter wasn't present) you might want to reconsider.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|OMG!!!this game is amazing ..I love it soo mucch I totally recomend this for kindle fire.....!!!!!..love....get this also works on fones have it on my sisters:)

B004UID2LC|2.0|it was working amazing .... then it just stopped letting me download -.- i have downloaded many songs and videos and i use it for school alot but now that it doesnt work its useless. im done.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game but should be able to earn credits faster with out having to post to facebook all the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a completely fantastic book. i would recommend  it to anyone. the story just grabs you and draws you in the whole way through!
B008ALAHA4|3.0|I upgraded from a 2011 MBP to a 2012 rMBP. With my old computer I had an extra power adapter. In order to use it on the rMBP, I had to purchase this adapter which is fairly priced at $9.99.<br /><br />In short, it does what it says. That is good. However, I was a little concerned about two details.<br /><br />1 - It has a lot of packaging and reading materials.<br />2 - I felt it was a little big, not sure what is going on in there, but would have been nice to be half the size.<br /><br />Any other vendor, I would give this a 4 star review. However I expect more from Apple.
B00887490Y|2.0|I do not leave reviews but after watching this I have to say's what kind of society to we live in where its ok to take people kids because they are not living as high and mighty as others. Why not just help the parents. Do you know how many small town kids who lived in trailer or worst make it out of that. Or a ghetto. Or even the rich kids who commit suicide or kill others. This film is a slap in the face to every hard working. Mother every hard working family who hasce some troubles but still love there kids and try to give them everything. Let social services do that job by this movie saying someone should kidnap someones child because rich society does not feel like they are raised right is wrong. By the way I'm middle class. And was raised. In new York. Without a silver spoon and my kids have more and will gain more knownledge by everything around them. As I continue to grow myself. This is sickening. Not a bad movie but in bad taste.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I got the new kindle fire hd and was looking for an app that could take pictures and videos.  It worked for a while and I could even put my pictures that I took on my computer, but for some reason it stopped working because of a camera error.  Tried reinstalling, no luck.  But I was excited that I at least found something that could take pictures.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't like the direction this book was heading in the beginning, but it still held my attention. I guess I was mostly worried that it would take the wrong pathway and ruin the entire trilogy for me, but no worries ... I can go on to book three and enjoy it. From the moment I picked up the book I had one hope and the author met it.<br /><br />I only had one issue with the book, a reaction at the end that I thought was a little overplayed, but overall, I really enjoyed the book and can't wait to read the next.<br /><br />Though I've never been big on dystopian novels, they're really growing on me.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0093HDV20 inDIVISIBLE]]
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My 10 year old daughter and I LOVED this movie.  She loved the brave heroine, I loved the amazing animation and plot lines.  However, my 5 year old son was very frightened by all the \\"big-growling-bear-chasing-someone-through-the-woods\\" scenes.  Must see, but let the little ones watch something less exciting.
B00000G3PL|4.0|Good action flick's. Recomend the searies, even if it is older movies. I, like the relationship of the characters, working off each other. Some of Danny Globers best work.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is an exciting game and really fun to play. I didn't lose interest once and really enjoyed playing every night. No problems on Kindle Fire. There are lots of hints available and a zoom in the hidden object parts, so you never feel lost or like the game is too difficult.<br />My only complaint is that towards the end of the game, you have to tap back and forth between MANY scenes to get the tools or objects you need in order to complete the tasks and move forward with the story. For example, I had to go through 14 scenes (yes, I counted) to get an axe head, then go all the way back down into the tombs to use it.<br />Having said that, I would play this game all over again - graphics are great, the characters talk and you have to use your brain!
0385344333|4.0|There are a few constants with Reacher books. One, Reacher is usually trying to get from point A to point B with as little cost as possible because he doesn't have a job. Two, somewhere between the two points some idiot decides to get in Reacher's way. And, three, the idiot dies.<br /><br />The book opens with a dead guy who was murdered and Reacher on the side of the rode trying to hitch a ride to Virginia so that he can meet up with the girl he met in 61 hours. Reacher manages to get a ride with a group of three in the car. What Reacher doesn't know is that all three are liars (he figures that out pretty soon via his uncanny observations and using that magical mind of his). He also learns covertly in the car ride that woman passenger is there against her will and that she is a mother. That's all it takes for Reacher's hero complex to kick in. The story that is told after those revelations is pretty good. Since all three passengers in the car are liars, there are at least three different stories for Reacher to uncover. The uncovering is pretty good, leading to a conclusion that has a couple of surprising deaths, expected deaths, and as usual a story so complex only the mind of Reacher could figure it out. To tell any more would just ruin the book with spoilers. Just know that you won't be disappointed

The quality is top notch and assuming you don't have any easily grossed out friends, it's perfect for display.  Oh, and it also has Season 2 inside of it.

B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I must of seen this movie 10 times and it never gets old. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who liked the books
B006G3MZRQ|2.0|The story started off pretty good but got more and more unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous at the end.  The acting and dialogue were good, especially Nick Nolte.  But the melodrama got so thick at the end I could barely stand it.  It also started to get tiresome listening to Tommy grunt and snarl at everyone all hunched over like a cave man.  And, what a surprise, he turns out to be a war hero who never took credit for saving someone's life so the whole crowd is cheering for him.  That by itself...yea, okay; but added to all the other unbelievable stuff; no.  If the writers had consulted a group of high school boys, they probably would have recommended that.  Then how the fight turned out in the end: could it have even been attempted to make it more dramatic and moving?  What else could have been thrown in there to aim for a higher crescendo to make it by far the very most dramatic sports movie of all time--since that seems to have been what they were aiming for?  Maybe the other guy's daughter could have been taken hostage and he has to win to save her life, but at the same time Tommy actually had organ damage and would die if he was hit again.  Sound pretty good?  I mean, that would be even more dramatic right, and more dramatic is better.  This movie could have been good all the way through if the writers had shown a little bit of restraint, but they didn't.  It is possible to overdo something so that it just becomes dumb, and despite the good elements of this film, it could not have been much more overdone in the end.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|This needed a good, brisk editing. It reads like a book that was brought to the publishing company in shoe boxes.  Scenes don't go anywhere or repeat one another.  Dialogue meanders, nothing was examined for a balance between action and reflection.  Nobody smoothed it, shaped it or fitted its parts together.  It's like a movie that was edited by its director, who found every inch of film he shot to be worthy of inclusion.  I wonder if Lee is doing his own editing now.  He shouldn't.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|i couldnt put this book down. the build up from the first 2 books continues right through this one. non stop action but it does leave one big unanswerd question at the end.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|This entire production is a series of jumps between clips of 1 to 7 seconds duration - usually about 3 to 5 seconds from one viewpoint and then JUMP to another camera.  It made me physically ill.  This kind of spastic \\"cinematography\\" is what I would expect from a 6th grader with ADHD.  For a \\"major motion picture\\" to be produced so badly is an insult.
B000FBJHEO|1.0|Couldn't get into it. The irritation was that the writer was obviously impressed with himself and how much more intelligent he is than the rest of the world.
0525952926|4.0|I have been waiting for this book with baited breath since reading the first of Follett's trilogy two years ago. I remember feeling so frustrated to have to wonder about the characters for two long years before the unfolding of the next part was available. It seemed incredible to me to be teased with such a marvelous first only to have to agonizingly wait for the second. Once it finally showed up I inhaled every word in less than a week.<br /><br />It's a well done book but disappointing in that I found a number of questions as I read along. Knowing Follett's pension for accuracy, now and then I found his use of terms questionable. Why would an English lord address his parent as \\"Dad\\" rather than the uptight, typical English form of \\"father?\\" A small wrinkle in the dialogue but it bugged me for pages because it seemed out of place and definitely incorrect.<br /><br />One of the tendancies in Russia is to refer to the same person by different names.  There are so many characters  that it was frequently difficult to remember who was who especially when the story focused on the Russians.  Thankfully Follett recalled particular incidents to identify previous events and attempted to keep the players from becoming so overloaded with detail you lost track of who was who.  Still, between all the historical events and how he threaded the stories from one to the other I often found it confusing to keep everyone straight.<br /><br />I suppose this book suffers from the malady of not measuring up to its predecessor no matter what.  Makes me wonder if the third will fall into the same traps of so much with so many.  Would it have been better to have delved deeper into incidents with fewer folks?  Would all three books have been better and more impacting if similar stories involved more in depth coverage with less people to keep track of?<br /><br />Follett is a master storyteller and his ambition to cover this monumental amount of history the way he has is admirable.  I thoroughly enjoyed Winter of the World and look forward to the third in his series but, I'm not dying of curiosity this time.  I can easily wait another two years to get the rest of the story.
B009IF7JRA|5.0|This was an awesome show, but I am little annoyed that fox thinks it can show an ad before the each show.  I paid to watch commercial free.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|I thought this movie was very interesting.  A good story, and well made movie.  Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is a great match for being a younger Sam Shepard and I liked that Butch Cassidy/James Backthorn had some ethics about who he would and wouldn't rob.<br /><br />Watched this online via Amazon.com and the picture was sometimes blurry - not sure if it was them or my internet provider, but thought I'd mention it.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Shipped and delivered very fast.  I loved the movie and the songs in it, so I decided to buy the soundtrack... Now I can't stop singing and rocking while I'm driving.  If you liked the 80s rock you will definately like this.
B0068THAGY|4.0|At first it reminded me of the Goonies but it was different. I thought about \\"IT\\" but it wasn't that either. The bottom line is that it was it's own movie and a pretty good one. While it didn't have the most original plot line it did have a few new wrinkles and it did make you care about the characters, that's important. No really big name actors but they all did a good job. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Elle Fanning, She was terrific! I won't go into all the details, you can read that in the other reviews. And actually I think the best part is I can watch it with my grand kids. :) Well, the older anyhow it is PG 13.

B008NW67E0|5.0|I just finished listening to the new album all the way through for the first time and it does not disappoint. There were many chill-inducing moments of brilliance. You can feel every emotion, heart beat and drop of sweat as these guys laid it all out there. They pick up what The Waterboys started 23 years ago with their brilliant Fisherman's Blues album: acoustic music full of heart and soul. The addition of The Boxer cover was very nice on the deluxe edition as well. Buy this and then go see them live.

B007G51UV0|1.0|So this is my second Z77 V Pro motherboard from Amazon cause the first I was told by tech support was defective and they wanted to rma it.  It was one week old and had the same issues that the second one has.  Does not wake from sleep state and then keeps wanting me to select boot device after I restart it.  I'm told by tech support to disable features so it would hopefully work, that doesn't.  The wifi go doesn't even work.  The manual says you should be able power on via keyboard (pg 3.26) but doesn't exist in the bios.  WFT?  Tech support is useless.<br />Unhappy and stay clear.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I love the Kurt Wallander mysteries. They are the smoothest, easiest, most interesting reads. Wallander's personal life and day to day details are included without wordiness. I haven't even finished this book yet, and I am giving it 5 stars. I'm sure the kudos go not only to Henning Mankell (Author), but also to Steven T. Murray (translator) for accomplishing this.<br />Jeani

B000007NZ5|5.0|I once believed that any Black Sabbath that did not include Ozzy was not truely Black Sabbath, or worth while.  Then I gave the Dio era a try and enjoyed the hell out of it. Later, I gave Tony Martin a listen and I really enjoyed his contribution as well.  Headless Cross is my favorite from the Tony Martin era.  However, I really enjoy The Eternal Idol, Tyr and Cross Purposes as well.  I encourage any Sabbath fan to at least give Sabbath's post-Ozzy/Dio offerings a try.  Headless Cross is a great place to start.  Enjoy!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Considered briefly giving this review a 1 or 2 star review so MAYBE someone would read it; but I'll just vent for the sake of venting. I have other bluray movie releases that have a sort of pop video/info setting or selection that makes for a very enjoyable movie experience, some of which you can select during and then see a behind the scenes feature. I don't understand why this Marvel Second Screen thing is not ON the bluray so it can be watched on my TV. I don't have the control of my two eyes for one to look at my laptop and the other my big screen TV. Also I seriously doubt the website will be active in 5-10 years so I can still use this feature. I usually am one of the people who likes to look at pre-concept art, drawings and story boards, yet instead of having it on the disc playing or selectable as a special feature it's a download ??? - and don't even get me started about it only being Itunes/Ipad garbage...at least it was accessible thru the website - for now<br /><br />Oh yeah, the movie was awesome.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|The fourth season changes Dexter from the cold thing of season one to a married father of three living in the suburbs.<br />However, Dexter still has \\"special needs\\" but much less time to take care of them.  This causes problems with Rita as some things cannot be explained.<br /><br />John Lithgow plays Trinity the most successful serial killer ever encountered.  This is a complex and freighting look at a monster passing as normal.<br />Dexter determined to kill Trinity is fascinated by his lifestyle while questioning how much danger he represents for his family.<br />Trinity and another kill, create more questions as they heighten his fear.  The interplay between Trinity and Dexter is great fun to watch.<br />Two fine actors create a believable relationship based on complex personas with similar needs.<br /><br />There is major character development in this season as Debra, LaGuerta, Batista and others become more of real people and less of plot devices.<br />Dexter's family life is a second but important storyline that cannot be ignored.  The marriage is having problems due to Dexter's \\"special needs\\".<br /><br />So many things happening this is not the season you can skip.  While not all of it is good, all of it is worth watching.

Both are looking to find their younger brother's killer.<br />As the deputy spins out of control, Dexter and the ADA grow close.  In time, they start working together cleaning up Miami.<br />Jimmy Smits is outstanding as the driven Miguel Prada, trying to maintain his persona.<br /><br />This is a well written season full of black comedy, police work and several good story lines.  As always, the acting is excellent.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very well written, first hand account of the mission that led up to and included the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. Offers a different view of what transpired during the mission that is different from the White House's report.

B00457X7XQ|4.0|I can highly recommend this book. If you're into computers or into crime/thrillers, this book is for you. A really nice story that pulls you in from the first few chapters. The scary part is that it's fiction, but everything is realistic enough for it to really happen.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Following Cut the Rope, Cut the Rope : Experiments is a great game. I like how they added in area objects or devices to make it more interesting. At first, I didn't like at all.

B0096HID5M|5.0|Loved this movie! I especially loved the music...I was born in '89 so I missed the whole 80's era but my parents made darn sure I listened and appreciated many old school songs. So this wasn't like the first time I've ever heard this music and I was very surprised (in a good way) that the cast was able to pull them all off so well. As soon as a get paid again I'm buying this soundtrack because I was that impressed.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you either love it or you don't, but I absolutely loved it! It was pure entertainment and it's nice to watch a movie and just enjoy instead of worrying about the plot or anything else. Plus, there was great music involved! A win, win movie all around  :)
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good game, but on Kindle Fire there are some levels that are impossible to win due to timing issues:  you can't throw your first rock fast enough.  That cost it a star.  Otherwise, great time waster.
0307592731|2.0|I chose this book because I live near and have hiked portions of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  Because it has been on top of the best seller list for quite a few weeks and Oprah selected it for her book club, I was encouraged to read it, even purchased it in hardcover, something I rarely do.  What a disappointing read!<br /><br />Strayed's focus is on glorification of out-of-control sexual behavior and heroin use.  I would not recommend the book, especially to young people.  Further,  she walked sections of the PCT, not the entire trail.  While I'm not putting her down for that, I just state reality.<br /><br />The best, most authentic  parts, of this book are about her mother's life and death and her young years living in poverty, which could have been written 15 years ago.  Those sections of the book touched me.  I appreciated discussion of the people she met along the Trail, but overall, I came away lacking trust in grand reviews and reviewers listed on the cover.  I appreciate that Strayed feels she found herself during the 1100 miles she walked, but I had looked forward to not being able to lay this book down.  Was I wrong!  I plodded through the book.<br /><br />My neighbor, also female, who has hiked more of the PCT than I have, has been planning to do all of it.  I loaned the book to her because she's well-down on the borrower list at the local library, and asked her to talk with me about it when she finished.  Yesterday morning, after having the book two days, she handed it to me over the front fence.  I said, \\"How was it?\\"  Her response, \\"It wasn't well-written, she didn't walk the PCT, and I'm trying to decide why she waited so long to tell us about her early sexual exploits.  She wrote about those with such pride.\\"  I had expected her to give me reason to change my earlier opinion, but I came away feeling sad that a fellow Oregonian had gotten such rave reviews for a generally mediocre effort.<br /><br />I'm going to be more cautious about \\"best sellers\\" in the future, will stick to books that got much less praise like John Daniel's, The Far Corner that really inspired me about the Pacific Northwest.s\\" in the future, will stick to books that got much less praise like John Daniel's, The Far Corner that really inspired me about the Pacific Northwest.
B003LD9P4K|5.0|Watched 40th Anniviversary concert this week on TV & had to get a concert on blu-ray. Husband picked out Montreux & glad he did!!! Encore on now and it's the best Monteux concert since \\"Yes at Montreux\\". \\"Yes\\" is my standard that all music is  rated against and starting out ELP was a modest 1 point behind. That changed while engrossed in this one!  During the show my rating kept getting closer to Yes!  Carl Palmer is a showman like Wakeman! AMAZING!  You must have this!!!! No regrets! You will gain a lot of respect for their talent! Buy it now!
B0049J2CKE|4.0|This is a really cute kid's movie, and it has enough plotline to keep the adults entertained as well. It only had a little violence (mostly in the beginning), And one or two kisses. The fact that they drank wine throughout the movie didn't bother me.<br />I'd recommend watching this, with or without your kids.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I pre-ordered this with some trepidation.  When she first mentioned years ago that she was writing a \\"political fairy story for adults\\" I didn't think I would be fully on board without more details.  When word came earlier this year that the book would drop during the eight-week \\"sweet spot\\" before the Presidential Election in the United States I grew leery.  There are a lot of political issues about which Rowling and I seem to generally agree but I felt that the danger of this being a bleak polemic was high.<br /><br />When the download was delivered to my Kindle on release day the font size error made reading difficult.  But I'll read anything; I've been known to hide under the sheets with a flashlight and a magnifying glass to drink in a really great read.  I struggled through the first \\"day\\"; a bleak prologue describing the mundane sadness of the hero's ordinary life, ending with him dead face-down in a pool of his own vomit while his wife of nineteen years crouches by, disheveled and weeping.<br /><br />Good times!<br /><br />(oh, at one point Rowling--presumably not wanting to use the word \\"car\\" twice in one sentence--refers to the vehicle as \\"a people carrier\\". Awkwardness, meet Trying too Hard)<br /><br />I ended up returning the Kindle version, giving it up as a bad job.  My 1-star review on GoodReads was greeted with foul language, hate mail and cries of \\"no fair! You can't review it if you didn't read it all\\".<br /><br />I maintain that one can state equivocally that one does not like a book once you've read enough of it to get the general feel of tone and language.  It's not possible to analyze the whole work, of course, or to discuss themes.  But it is indeed quite possible to make up one's mind after watching  Bored Barry and disinterested Mary take the people carrier through Tweetown to the inevitable brain aneurysm, barf and bawling.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The writing was clean and precise.   The story was compelling. I n ow see what all the hubub was about. Can't wait to start book two!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP!! Yes, a couple of issues, but I've came to the conclusion, my phone, after 2 years, hates me!! I've never had any issues, and I will continue to use this one!!
B0085MNZ66|3.0|I like the game concept. The first three levels are way too easy though. After that I discovered that you can't play this game on tablet. The entire game board does not display. If this gets fixed I'd definitely give it another go.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, Reacher was everything I expected him to be, a cross between Clint Eastwood and the Hulk. I can't wait for the next one.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this is an enjoyable time management game for hello kitty fans of any age.  if you've already beaten diner dash and sally's spa, this is comparable.  recommended!
1401234542|3.0|To start, all of the New 52 was supposed to be a relaunch that is new-reader-friendly. This book picks up right after Blackest Night and not many people will not understand the story. At first, during the war with Sinestro's Corps, it was fantastic. However, when it shifted over from Doug Mahnke's art to Mike Choi's it was just disastrous. Choi's art is just horrible. Very light, in contrast to Mahnke's dark pencil lines.<br /><br />AVOID, until you read:<br />Green Lantern: Secret Origin<br />Green Lantern: Rebirth<br />Green Lantern: No Fear<br />Green Lantern: Revenge of the Green Lanterns<br />Green Lantern: Hal Jordan--Wanted<br />Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 1<br />Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War Vol. 2<br />Green Lantern: Tales of the Sinestro Corps War<br />Green Lantern: Rage of the Red Lanterns<br />Green Lantern: Agent Orange<br />Green Lantern: Blackest Night<br /><br />Then you will understand this book and the series.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|Please don't get me wrong. This is by no means a bad film and it does tell Miller's story without changing it much. That is certainly a win. I simply expected this film to be more engaging.<br /><br />The ingredients are all there, but the filmmakers didn't take it to the next level. Frank Miller's edge, wit, style and intensity are all watered down in favor of moody set pieces and static scenes. I wish the director would have incorporated more combat and martial arts instead of so much mindless automatic weapon fire. Most of the action choreography consists of gang members standing in place and rapidly shooting their guns. That's noise, not action! The volume control for my remote got a better workout than most of the henchmen.<br /><br />The animation is mostly attractive and at times it resembles an episode of Batman the Animated Series, but for mature audiences of course. Some of the toon-shaded computer generated effects made me feel trapped inside a sub-par video game. This project should be treated with epic reverence rather than bargain budget tactics.<br /><br />I felt at arms-length with the protagonists throughout the story and that's something that does not happen with the novel. The voice talent is serviceable, yet the screenwriters neglected to add enough character development for the voice actors to work with and it shows.<br /><br />Again this is not a bad movie. It's just not among the best Batman animated pieces I've seen. I anticipated this pre-order more than any other in my queue. I wanted to love it! Instead, it will likely collect dust on my the back shelf of my Blu-ray collection.  The source material deserves better than this. I'm going to pull out Miller's novel and read it again this weekend. C+
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|Great movie, however, with the blu ray 3d release the digital copy was SD only. Other new releases I have recently bought have included an HD copy as the digital copy. Also all four discs were were only in two slots, basically discs were stacked on top of each other. Disappointed in the packaging.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed the series very much. It contained the essentials to keep you interested.There was mystery, romance,and a thriller. Each book kept me coming back for more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|All I can say to these men is thank you and job well done.  I'm glad they are watching our backs.
B0072HDP9M|5.0|I've been meaning to read this for years, and finally got around to it last week.  Now that I have read it, I've included it in my Kindle collection of classics, alongside Anne of Green Gables and Little Women - I get the same feeling of family, of closeness, of kindness, and of positivity from the world of the Whistle Stop Cafe....<br /><br />Having watched the movie (several times) Idgie and Ruth are dear friends of mine already, but it was wonderful having their relationship explored more fully, I watch the film in a new light now that I KNOW the nature of their relationship, and the (unspoken) awareness and support of the town was a joy to read about.  A larger 'cast' of supporting characters gave the book a richness that was like adding cream to cake, not always necessary, but so very enjoyable.<br /><br />Well worth a read if you love a story with well developed characters and a story with a strong heart.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game really does seem like tons of funand even though I am only on level 3, it is still just such a time catcher!
B000W15B24|5.0|I love The Man Comes Around, a powerful song about the truth of Messiah's return. Hurt and many of the other tracks are great just like everything that Cash made.
0345803485|1.0|Except for the last 15 or so pages, this is a weak book on many levels:  tepid plot line, stupid characters, trite sex scenes, limited vocabulary.  The narrator, Ana, is a neurotic dunderhead who whizzes through fifty emotions in a single conversation.  It's a book for Mitt Romney Republicans who aren't getting it elsewhere.  Hooray, however, for the mediocre author who's made gazillions from it.
1440503257|1.0|I was really disappointed that the recipes in this book do not work like they say.  I have made quite a few, and not one has turned out.  I am a very good cook, so it's not me that is the problem.  The fudge was goopy and never set right, the truffles never got firm like they should, etc.  My daughter wanted to help me make a lot of these recipes and finally she went back to my own recipe cards to make the items in this book, but in order to make them work.  It's a great idea, but really, not a good book if you actually intend on making the items.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Despite its controversial nature, No Easy Day is an in depth look at the best of our Special Forces, the Navy SEALs, and what life is like as such through one man's eyes. The war goes on in the Middle East, and every day are our forces are deployed there to keep America safe. Regretfully, we as a nation go about our business and don't often realize the sacrifices these men and women make. We owe them a tremendous dept!
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This movie reminded me of the film parodied at the end of Mr Bean's Holiday. It is so pretentious and awful, it will leave you in stitches....and I'm a film buff.  We turned it off after the first twenty minutes or so, and are still muttering \\"....mother....? \\" to each other...and collapsing in laughter.  The photography was pretty good, however, so I think this film is perhaps best appreciated by viewing its promotional stills, or watching it at 6x the clock speed, on mute.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Seriously could not put this book down!! The tension between Ana and Grey is gripping and you will dying to keep reading.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It took me longer than usual to finish this book. The book started well, but about half way in, I realized that the main characters were so unlikeable that I didn't really care what happened to them. The ending was especially unsatisfying. It was just like an M. Night Shyamalyn movie, and I don't mean that as a compliment. I'm just glad that I got it from the library. It certainly wasn't worth $13.
B004UID2LC|1.0|if you have a kindle fire like I do. dont waste your time. it fails to download more then 6 videos for me -w-
B0085MNZ66|2.0|No instructions, no tutorial, no hints. You're on your own. The puzzles I played with Test Drive weren't too hard to figure out, but I know that I was missing some strategy and ended up getting stuck. It just doesn't seen very engaging.<br /><br />I'm appreciative that the developer hasn't yet reviewed the game and told us how overwhelmingly exciting it is. :)
B007MG360G|5.0|This game is as fun as the other two games made but only wish they had more updates like the other games
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire is the perfect game to play when I want to spend time with myself and get things off my mind or when I'm waiting to see my doctor, waiting for the bus or for my date to arrive....and I can play all by myself!!!  its great!! I'm totally satisfied! !,
B006VSP906|5.0|Hitchens has given us another tour de force, all the more devestating for being his last. I loved the book, but missed him on every page. Will we ever have a more brilliant, funnier, more rigorously honest man in the world of literature, debating, TV appearances, and on and on? His wife's closing essay made me cry.<br />Adele Riepe
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps daughter entertained and I like it too!  lots of fun games and unlocks more as u go! definately worth trying!
B003RS7CT4|4.0|I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this episode.  I grabbed the cat and became flaculent on its wicked little head.  Do dah, do dah
0307719774|4.0|What a great idea! Was very excited to receive this! This is a compact sized book, but it's not very heavy.  The cover is made of some thick, sturdier, cardboard type material, but I like it. The gold foil around the edges probably won't hold up for 5 years, but that doesn't bother me.  It can be a little cramped writing in this journal, especially on the left hand side of the book, where it doesn't lie flat (I'm right handed), but it's doable, and I've gotten used to it.  Not all of the questions are particularly thought provoking, and you are given 4 lines to answer each question, but I like it regardless, amd I think the idea is very cute! Some sample questions are: \\"Did you kiss someone today?\\", \\"What would you like to ask your mother?\\", \\"How much spare change do you have?\\", \\"Are you hard working or hardly working?\\" etc. There's good questions with some duds here and there, but overall I'm very pleased and would definitley recommned this to someone who wants to start a journaling project without too much effort.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Wish you could level and purchase guys faster. Other than that, it is an ok game to pass the time.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|Pretty simple game. Some people seem to have gotten stuck on level 6... it's all about the order in which you do things; just because it starts red doesn't mean it can't finish orange.<br />4/5 because the undo function is tedious (on the fire at least) and from what I can tell there's no reset button.<br />Other than that, it's fun, simple, and offers a challenge.
B009IJJ712|4.0|When I first saw the ads on CBS for this show I thought \\"can't they come up with anything new?\\". I was pleasantly surprised with this adaption of Sherlock Homes. In this version it's almost as though Mr Homes is a autistic savant in his rather rude behaviour and his his abilities to pick out clues, trends, and usually draw the correct conclusions.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy playing the game. Building is fun. Even my kids and grandkids enjoy playing. They fight of who's going to play when they get out of school.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I love this game! It is so addicting! The picture isn't that clear; a little fuzzy; but to me that doesn't matter. The controls are a little hard to get used to; but once you figure them out the game is VERY fun! I do not have the full version; so you only have one person; one car; one track; and a few other things. The free version is still really fun!
B005HSL626|3.0|the game itself is terrific, but it has a bunch of ads, and it never opens. Please fix, I love this game, plus it's free.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I loved this movie. I love the cast, the storyline, the action; all of it.<br /><br />I bought the 2 disc set for the special features, the gag reel in particular. Imagine my surprise when it came in the mail and all of the actual \\"special\\" features were on the Blu-ray disc. No disrespect to Blu-ray but I really would've liked to know that the special features were Blu-ray disc only. I would've totally just bought this on iTunes and saved myself the disappointment.<br /><br />Movie was still awesome but this was a total let down.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I read a good chunk of this at the bookstore to see if it would be something that is worth the $30+.  I never made it through the whole thing, so I'm not the best judge on the overall plot, but I can say unequivocally that the writing style is flat and the characters are dull and unimaginative.  Many people seem concerned that the book is being compared to Harry Potter too unfairly, but the author's previous work shows us what she is capable of, and she is falling short by miles and miles.<br /><br />First the content.  It's not the F bomb that bothers me.  It's not the sex or the violence or the gritty death.  I'm a big girl, I can handle it.  What bothers me is how these things are slathered into this story as the driving force of the book and thrown in where it doesn't make sense.  Every page has something the author decided was \\"adult\\" and shocking, as if to tell the world that she doesn't want to be associated with those darn kids' books anymore.  It's the literary equivalent of a child star posing for a smut rag.<br /><br />Further, nothing could interest me about these characters.  Nothing.  Pagford is populated by shallow, dull people living pathetic lives.  I'm sure that's the point she was trying to convey, but the reason I read is to be inspired, uplifted, entertained and to learn something.  A town full of shallow idiots doesn't make enough of a point.  I'm familiar with the plot, even if I didn't waste my life sitting through the whole book.  No one gets redeemed.  I skipped ahead to a suicide and a health issue I saw from a mile away.  Life sucks, is that the point of this book?  Thanks, Captain Obvious.  In the part I did read, characters have stereotypical thoughts and motivations, much of which is relayed through telling and no action or emotion.  Not the way to start a book.  This book is like looking at a window with cling decals on it: transparent and flat.<br /><br />Now as for the writing style, Rowling has always been a little weak on the basic mechanics of how to write fiction.  She gets wrapped up in pointless description, would rather tell than show and her sentences are often clunky.  Her work could almost always be about 200 pages shorter.  However, in the past her world was imaginative and her characters likable, more or less, so I could deal with it.  Here, without likable characters or a compelling setting, her flaws as a writer stand out as almost the sole focal point.
B004UID2LC|2.0|it keeps searching amd when i updated it it deleted all my videos and i cant even download any back! was workinf fine at first but now suckz!
1933308087|5.0|I received my copy yesterday.  The book is beautifully laid out and organized.  I appreciated the blocks done in modern fabrics with that Jenny Beyer touch.  Some of the print is difficult to read because of the type style and gold color however this is a great go to book for block design ideas.  I thought that the plastic templates provided were helpful for recreating a block design.  I can't wait to get started recreating some of these blocks in my next project.<br /><br />love this book would recommend it to any quilter.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Provided you read the book and are privy to how the story goes then this is a good complement to the book and works well, if you haven't read the book you will have missed all of the soliloquys that transpired and may have a difficult time understanding the story.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Do not buy this movie in any format until you know, for fact that, the additional 60 minutes cut out of the theatrical version, are added in. The theatrical version of this movie (if you're an Aliens and Ridley Scott fan) will feel rushed and choppy. So many pieces of the narrative are left hanging and the characters appear as shallow as a B-movie horror flick. \\"Hey that guy died. Was I supposed to care about him?\\" All of the digital pre-releases are talking about an additional \\"60 minutes\\" of footage that can be viewed. But are they IN the movie. Immediately after seeing this movie in the theater my impression was \\"that would be a completely different movie if it had like another 45 minutes in it.\\" Not that I'm some kind of film genius, but if you had this cast, this story and the brilliance of Ridley Scott, would you make this short, pretty, drop-in-the-bucket of a film? Give me the full directors cut of this film or it ain't gettin' added to my queue. (Like LOTR I'm not going to have the theatrical AND the full versions sitting on my shelf)
1416987118|5.0|Our 3 year-old grandson smiles all the way through this book. Because of the rhythm and repetition, it is easy to memorize and becomes very interactive. We read part of the sentences and he fills in the rest. He get so excited. I'm sure it won't be long before he is \\"reading\\" pages all by himself. We have a copy to give to our 2 year-old grandson and one to keep one at our house, too!

B0090P98Z4|5.0|Very fun game. for a free app, surprisingly entertaining. of course, most of the good weapons have to actually be purchased, but so far it's a good time.
1846972043|5.0|This is a story for children but it can still be read and enjoyed by adults.  Precious Ramotswe, even as a child, was interested in solving mysteries.  When food starts going missing at her school she is sure the boy accused by the rest of the children is not the culprit.  Can she manage to find out the truth?<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this little book as it has all the hallmarks of a No 1 Ladies Detective Agency story.  The attention to detail and the way Precious knows whether people are lying or not just by talking to them.  I recommend this to anyone who likes a good story - whether you are an adult or a child.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Regina never disappoints! This is an amazing album. Highly recommended. From \\"All the row boats\\" to \\"Jessica.\\" Regina has progressively become more poppy but still holds true to her original style.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent, it's time for the truth to come out. Not the junk Washington want's us to believe. I down loaded it on my Kindle Fire and couldn't stop reading.  I didn't see any classified data in the book all common knowledge.  Drive on.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Great animation, weak story. There wasn't anything great about this movie other than Johnnie Depp and even he can't turn this into something that it's not.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection is near perfection. The characters are very well fleshed out and complex, and the pacing is dead on. How we learn what the purpose of the silos, through the characters individual awakenings, is brilliant. All I can say about the story without giving away any spoilers is the old adage \\"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions\\".....
B0085MNZ66|1.0|I downloaded and attempted to load the<br />Game only to have it crash at the splash screen every time. This is unfortunate as it did look entertaining

B008XOXGL0|4.0|I been following these guys since they first ep's which amazon doesn't sell anymore which is also very funny because a lot of these songs are from those E.P's. But nevertheless this is a great album the pressing of the music sounds good on vinyl except the pressing is a bit sloppy the vinyl wasn't cut right. The price this vinyl is going for is a bit crap. Since it docent come with an mp3 download it shouldn't be this high and you can get it for a lot cheaper at a local record store, I got mine for 12 bucks.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book dug deep into the spiritual soul of the reader.  The experience of the character in the book made the reader look into their own soul for their beliefs.
0061146307|4.0|Newly orphaned, the wealthy Baudelaire children are swept off to the home of a distant relative, the mysterious and cruel Count Olaf. Though no one believes them, the children know he will do anything to steal their fortune, and they must stop him or lose their lives. I've wanted to read the Series of Unfortunate Events, and this first volume firmly lives up to but does not exceed expectations. It's short and simple, but it sets the tone for the series: a strong and self-aware authorial voice which is a dark mirror to the moralistic Victorian children's book narrator and its progeny; a gothic sensibility concerned less with indulging in fearful pleasure and more with wallowing in misfortune, which is its own way a delight. The exaggerated squalor, cruelty, and the frustration of adults (whether they be dangerous, disbelieving, or simply ineffectual) is well balanced by modestly believable and strongly self-reliant characters. In all the book is a success, but its selling points--voice and atmosphere--will not be able to sustain the series on their own. I enjoyed this beginning and I'll pick up the next volume, but I hope the rest of the series offers something more substantive in the way of character or plot.

I attmepted to contact the Seller on three separate occassions via his email address in the span of three months, and never received a response.  THIS IS NOT anywhaere near Seller's service response history, BUT A ONE STAR is my vote.  No courtesy of a reply, or any attempt to resolve this issue. DO NOT RECOMOMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE!!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Perfect action ride, with a plot that keeps you engaged. This along with the fact that there are some amazing heart pounding moments make it a must watch.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|Too many stars to list.  Non-stop entertainment.  Watched it for years and now I'm going to buy it.  They don't allow this kind of language or violence in newer movies.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Can't wait for the next two books in this trilogy. a wonderful escape! Much beeter than the cathedral stories. Actual history and a bit of romance. Loved it!
1892005034|5.0|This book is a great tool for learning how to communicate effectively. It shows us that when we're emotionally triggered, it's usually because a need of ours isn't being met. But if we can learn to uncover that need (which puts responsibility of our feelings back on ourself) and verbalize this to the other person, along with the emotions we're feeling, they are more likely to \\"hear\\" us, instead of becoming defensive.<br /><br />One of the things I love about this book is it really urges us to take responsibility for our emotions and actions, instead of blaming others. (And in my experience, that's a lesson that many still need to learn)<br /><br />There are also many excellent real-life examples of this communications tool (or language) in action. Great book!
B0038P59A0|2.0|I've read the books and seen the Ronald Howard movies.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. hardly fits my picture of Holmes at all.  And tho I sometimes like Jude Law very much (as in \\"The Holiday\\"), he made a poor Watson with the script given him.<br /><br />On the plus side, my wife and son liked the movie for the comedy.<br /><br />I'm not paying for the sequel.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is not just a mindless pusher, there is some skill and physics involved with knowing where to drop your coins and predicting how the others will move. I have enjoyed it quite a bit.
B0086700CM|4.0|When I'm playing if my hand gets even near the pause button the game sort of stutters. Its annoying but other than that I love it!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Extremely touching as well as informative. I am a huge fan of  Ken Follett and he did not disappoint. I cant wait for the next installment.
B000HEWEE4|2.0|I think they started with a good idea for this movie then couldn't figure out how to film it so that it isn't just totally confusing. It's charming of course as it was meant to be and the characters are sympathetic but it just never really gets off the ground as story telling. Either it's a fairy tale or it's not. They couldn't seem to make up their minds.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I cant put it down I keep wanting to unlock more and more stuff I used to love this game at arcades and now I can play it anywhere
B000683VI4|2.0|I just thought this movie was boring. I enjoyed the parts about the old couple but when it switched back to the young couple I just didn't find them appealing or believable. It is not a movie I would keep in my library or ever look at a second time.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This book started out really suspenseful and I enjoyed it in the beginning. The deeper I got into the book the more invested I was so of course I finished the book, but he seems to put details in that could be left out because it doesn't add to the story. I started skimming through the last few chapters because he just added way to much detail and the action was to drawn out for me. Overall an okay read if you can get over the useless detail and the not so great ending.
076780421X|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I usually don't care much for romantic comedies.  This movie is extremely well done. The supporting cast is excellent. The story is very believable and well presented. It's touching and it's funny.  What could have turned out as a piece of junk actually came out as an excellent movie. I first caught part of it on t.v. then was able to find a used VHS copy. As soon as I could find it on DVD on Amazon I ordered it.  I'm not a fan of either of the lead stars so why I think this movie is so great is beyond me. It's the little moments that get to me and there are many, many of those little moments. This is one of those movies where the perfect story and the perfect cast for that movie with the perfect director just come together. Nothing is forced. It's all natural. Slapstick in places - yep - but tender too. I'm sure you'll like it.

B00003CXV4|2.0|I guess my title is basically all I have to say about this movie. The original was wonderful. This is just pale by comparison. Don't waste your time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|After dating my boyfriend (who is in the military and has been deployed x2) this book and answered alot of questions that he doesn't like to talk about or can't. In no way does it give any weaknesses to our military however it answers questions I have had in cretain areas. I enjoyed this book very much and was brought to tears at one point due to the sacrifice of these men and women. LOVED IT!! and definiately recommend to everyone.
B008O037RG|5.0|Mumford & Sons never fail!!! This album  is ridiculously amazing! Including songs like 'below my feet' my personal favorite! And ofcourse their new single 'i will wait' and another favorite 'ghosts that we knew' 'lover of the light' and 'lovers' eyes' 'AMAZING!<br /><br />Their sound transcends what's out there filled with beautiful melanchony yet robust sounds of unique instruments. Their lyrical metaphors and arrangments of their verses. GENIUS!!  Anyone can enjoy their pure talents. This year they better win the Grammys!!

B0085MNZ66|4.0|Looking through reviews generally tells me what to expect, and then I try it for myself to see how it stacks up. Usually, there are some mixed comparisons, with a lot of complaints holding true for everyone. This game is a lot like what everyone said: no real instructions, a fairly difficult learning curve, and a bit of functionality problems with Undo and Reset on Kindle Fire. However, the one major point that absolutely made this app a keeper for me is the fact that the developer actually read the reviews, and then gave honest, helpful responses to the users with complaints. That, alone, made me keep this app, and I'll certainly be keeping my eye on One Lives Left to see what else they might do in the future.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good graphics.  Movement is a bit sloppy.  Also, required fee for better advancement is unfortunate. Being able to replay a level would be great.

B006LSZECO|4.0|My first book by this author and I was impressed. Engaging and thrilling with great details and very well written. While I couldn't put the book down, the \\"twist\\" at the end did leave me feeling a little unsatisfied. I grew to have a favorite character and in a book that was all about good vs evil, the end was a bit of a compromise. Overall, though, an awesome read.

0525478817|4.0|There are tons of books written about kids with cancer--both fiction and non-fiction. And when picking up this book, I wondered to myself what else could really be said about this. What was the author going to contribute to this genre of literature.  Boy was I wrong!  I thought that John Green did a masterful job telling the story from the perspective of a 16 year old girl--Hazel--who knows she is dying. There really is not a cure for the form of lung cancer she has.  The only question really is how much longer she has to live.  And then she meets what can only be described as an amazing and unique guy named Augustus--another young man who seems to have beaten the cancer he had some years ago albeit at the cost of one of his legs.  He not only mystifies her but also brightens her day as only one teenager can do to another. Hazel really hadn't know love before and was introduced to it by Augustus. They become close, spend so much time together, and then tragedy strikes in many forms.  Without giving away the key elements of the book I will say that you will likely be moved to tears as you read of Hazel's struggle with her illness, her feelings for Augustus, and her desire to just be a regular, normal teenage woman.  A very worthwhile read and I highly recommend it.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|Seasons one and two: This is a REALLY engaging show, well-written, funny, and with a great ensemble cast. OK, some of the legal cases and scenes aren't real, but it's a TV show for entertainment, not reality. I really enjoy the characters and how they interact with one another. How can you not love Harvey? And not feel for Louis? (Ok, that was a bit tongue in cheek.) In addition to being very well-written, the filming and  production is well done as well.  Yes, I love it, and I don't feel that way about many television shows. My  20 year old son started watching it first, and got me hooked. Can't wait for season three!
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Loved the books and love the movie even with the changes from the books.  Michael York and Jenny Agutter are enjoyable in their respective rolls.  For entertainment it fits the bill.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy this game because it is amazing. Sponsered by actual youtubers. One con is that this game is 7 dollars, notch please put the free version on the kindle fire.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I would love to read this book. I am a J.K. Rowling fan. However,my rating of the book is due to the price. I think the price is way too high. Amazon is taking advantage of the J.K. Rowling name. I will read when it is as reasonably priced as other best selling books.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|product was what i expected.all the dvds worked perfectly fine,not a scratch on any of them.quality was good,package wasn't damaged.i would definitly purchase from this seller again.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|This awful awful remake of an absolutely perfect movie known as \\"Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory\\" reminds me of the equally insufferable \\"Cat In The Hat\\" starring Mike Myers and \\"Toys\\" starring Robin Williams some years back. Just wasted, empty time. Johnny Deep's character casts Wonka as an effeminate sociopath emotionally and psychologically crippled by a repressive childhood. It's just not believable. It felt like the incredibly overrated Johnny Depp trying to act weird and creepy instead of the character being so. There's no laughs. There's no warmth. There's no suspense. The musical numbers are plain dumb and desperate. It's a complete fail. There really was no need to remake Wonka. Gene Wilder's performance was pure genius. Depp's Wonka is simply a case of bad acting to a poorly written script. I don't care about the book and whether this film sticks closer to it. It STINKS.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Doesn't get much  better than this. Sync notes  to internet to be able to view them on internet connect device.
0061452068|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It really is an optimistic view of the future, a view which I share.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a great read! I love that Chris tells it like it is, and doesn't care what people think. It's funny, and sad, and everything in between. It's nice to get a glimpse of the war through a soldier's eyes for a change, instead of the media, because we all know how they like to sensationalize, even if it means their facts are way off base! I'd love to read more!
B004UID2LC|2.0|This was the GREATEST APP EVER til it stopped working. WHY ? &quot;Youtube&quot; WHY? Please fix ASAP! I just can't go on without my &quot;YouTube&quot;!!!!! Ok I can go on,  but I gotta have my YOUTUBE!!!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|A wild and edge of seat experience.  Tied in all the other Bourne movies well.  Great scenery and photography. I hope we keep getting to see more of this series!
B003LL3LHO|3.0|This book was a fun read. I won't recommend it for its literary value, its writing style or even its plot, but I enjoyed the references to people and places I have encountered in Tyria, and not having played much GW1, I found the background and lore it offers quite interesting. Recommended to those who like the game and for some reason or other aren't currently playing it.
0440246008|2.0|It is a testimony to Lee Child's talent that I had to read 3 of the Reacher novels to decide I'll never buy one again. This is a hero who easily seduces ladies, but does not want any commitment, evolves in an atmosphere of horrible gore peppered with a bit of sex, and plays judge and jury, usually killing the \\"bad guys\\" himself rather than relying on the justice system. This was the exact formula of Ian Fleming for James Bond.<br />What makes Reacher different? A tint of the sixties. He is drifter who only gets a new shirt in each book, and he has no interest in money. A killer, nevertheless. From one book to the next, I went from the impression that the hero killed in a moment of indignation to the realization that this is the main theme of each book, because the Bond formula is so successful. The problem of a formula is that one gets stuck with a hero that cannot change. Some writers are successful at making their hero evolve with each book: they divorce, the get happy or unhappy, they age, they have a life. Reacher cannot change any more than James Bond: he is the formula.<br />Once you understand the formula, everything becomes predictable, and for this book, you will guess the pathetic ending 200 pages too soon. I am not risking another one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has sooooooooooooooo many games to choose from hmmmm. let's see there are hard games fun games gun games it's awesome
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i was looking for a simple calculator for my kindle fire and came across this one. didnt know what to expect but in my math class i used it and it worked very well for a free app. i think it would be great if you kept it free! basic calulator but works GREAT!!!! :)
B0088749CW|2.0|The Tall Man tells the story of the small town Cold Rock, and, of course, the infamous Tall Man that abducts children without a trace; Jessica Biel's character, Julia, becomes a victim of the Tall Man and races to save her son. At least, this is the first half of the film. Soon, the audience is thrown twist after twist after twist.<br /><br />First, technically speaking, I really liked the film. It's beautifully shot in a great location for a film with such a dark subject matter. The acting was decent, and the music was great. (although I'm almost positive I've heard some of it before.) Now, the first half of the film was great. We are introduced to the Tall Man and his legend through effective news clips and town talk. Then, we witness a thrilling abduction filled with tension and some jump-scares. But what starts off as a promising thriller/horror film eventually turns into a conspiracy/mystery/drama film. To be honest, I feel like it quickly loses its focus and foolishly throws its chance away to create an iconic horror character. (I really think the Tall Man could've easily worked as a horror character movie, just imagine a giant man creeping through your home and abducting your child.) It does have some great twists, but some of them are just too far out or predictable. Also, there's a scene where Julia rants about how the system doesn't work and about politics, which I felt was unnecessary although it does slightly relate to the film. My final complaint is that it drags on at times; when you think it's over, it actually packs in more. I did like the actual ending and the touching monologue, though.<br /><br />Overall, although it starts off well, The Tall Man is ultimately unfocused; and, personally, I feel like it doesn't effectively use the Tall Man (he's barely seen or used) and misses a crucial chance to create a horror icon. I'd recommend a rental before a purchase, as of 9/29/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.<br /><br />The Tall Man has strong violence and blood, no sex or nudity.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|Simple yes, fun yes. I see a lot of potential in updates for this game. I love the fact that the permissions are not intrusive.

Very repetetive.<br />Kept reading to see what happened between the 2main characters.<br />Sex scenes were so numerous and so repetetive that I skipped through most of them on the 3rd book

B006P96PAO|5.0|Love the message of this movie. It's truly biblical in everything. A must see for all that want a Godly and healthy family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like the book because it made you think about the way the world could be,it was also easy to read.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|A movie for all ages with a message that is very relevant to our future.  We LOVED it as an adult family and all our children and their children have, too!
B003Y74KCK|1.0|Looks nice but is very flimsy. It does not stay in place. The case does not fit the phone snug like it should. I replaced it after a week .
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It is interesting in that it gives you a good understanding of the work of the navy and their roll in the war on terror. I find the author uses too many abbreviations that are difficult to recall from chapter to chapter. The book could be shortened significantly. he rambles on too much in the past until the final climax which is the attack on the compound.
B000268D1K|5.0|I was given this album back in the day by my older sister, and the remastered disc proves that this music is just as amazing, raw yet sophisticated & cutting-edge as ever.  The Stones are still doing it, but this 2-disc compilation is their early, and in my opinion best work.  This item was received in due time and in perfect condition.  A great price for some of Rock's greatest music.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Excellent read connelly has done it again and wrote a outstanding story.   lots of twists and turns   i did enjoy this book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are at all interested in the Military, Special Operations, SEALs or the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden, this is a must read. Even if you're not into that stuff it is still a great book, hard to put down. You will NOT regret reading this book.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I was surprised to find a game that was this fun for a change. It is refreshing to have a game that i enjoy.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The only reason I give this 4 out of 5 stars is because I was tired of every chapter blaming the liberals and bashing the liberal media for what happened. This really started to get old after a while and, in my opinion, actually started to take away from the story a little bit. That being said, this is still one of the best books I have ever read and would recomend it to everyone! Especially if you are interested in special operations and SEALs, it gives you a great insight into what these guys go through in training and on missions. Even if you're not into military stuff, this is still a great book, hard to put down, and at the very least makes you proud to be an American.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|Won't install on my DROID4,  either. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book transports your imagination to that which exists in the minds of those who still think fairy tales are based on something real and that monsters might exist. A very good read. Hard to put down.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I didn't purchase this through amazon because I happened to stumble across it at Target. It was $29.99 which I thought was an awesome deal considering the doll alone is usually at least $20.99. It has seating for 3 dolls, 2 fit on the couch and 1 on the chair. It comes with the Clawdeen Wolf doll, a table, chair, couch and coffee shop, along with accessories such as treats, cups, cash register & a book.<br /><br />It's a freakishly fab awesome value, great for a birthday gift, christmas present, or as a treat for your monster high fan.
0525953728|5.0|The sacrifices these soldiers make for our country everyday and so much is unknown because all are so humble, amazes me. We should all be so greatful.
B006O6F932|5.0|I have to admit I was a little skeptical about purchasing this for $80 and having it be flimsy or cheap. After receiving this from Amazon On The Vine program, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. When we, my 11 & 13 yr old daughters and myself, took it out of the box and assembled it we all agreed this Monster High School set is AWESOME!!!! I thought it was fairly easy to assemble, for the first time it took maybe 30 minutes probably less. My daughters assembled the bleachers, the lab cart, and the desks and tables all on their own without help. It unfolds so easily, I was however frustrated at first because it seemed like the stairs wouldn't lock into place and the wall of the creepateria seemed to heavy like it kept leaning. However, if I would have looked at the directions closer, I would have seen looking at the front of the dollhouse(with the 2 doors), on the right side there is a little hand that you lock into the side of the other front piece(with the casketball net). That definitely makes a huge difference and then lets the stairs stay locked into place and stopped the front side with the casketball court from leaning. After initial set up the house can be set up and packed up in minutes.<br /><br />In my opinion this set is pretty sturdy, it has floors and contrary to what I read in another review the furniture stands up just fine. The walls and outline of the floor are constructed of plastic and the floors are a painted cardboard. There are 6 plastic useable casket shaped lockers, that are built in on the one wall, that actually come with adorable skull paddle locks that you can hook through the locker and the locks even open and close and you can put things in the lockers. The table it comes with is perfect for the Creepateria and easily fits four dolls at it. The top half of the Creepateria looks small but observing my girls playing with the set, they actually had 2 dolls sitting with their feet dangling over the edge and one doll standing behind the DJ booth (which when turned around is a trophy case) and another doll standing up. With all 4 dolls on the small top level it held in place well with no leaning whatsoever. It stayed sturdy.<br /><br />The casketball net easily attaches and the bleachers easily fit 4 dolls. Two can be placed on the top row and 2 on the bottom row and the bleachers do stay standing with or without the dolls on them. Also, the dolls stay seated on their own without having to hold them.<br /><br />I don't think I saw it mentioned but if you only unfold the dollhouse partially to only show the classroom side but not fully unfold the creepateria side, the opposite side of the classroom wall has a ghoul's room (restroom) pictured.<br /><br />The whole set is very roomy and the dolls fit through the doorways with plenty of room to spare. The accessories included are really cool too. It came with:<br /><br />approx 80 assorted stickers, 2 gargoyles, 2 books, dico ball, 8 flat pumpkin shape lanterns, casketball net & ball, DJ booth(that reverses to a trophy case), 6 skull locks, table, lab cart, 2 desks, 6 skull locks, bleachers, spirit staff & stand, trophy,plaque, 2 diaries, 2 pens, binder, clear canister with removable lid, frog, 2 spiderweb railings, a ladder that folds and creepateria food that consists of : 2 tall drinks, 2 bowls of food, a cauldron and 2 small cauldron shaped mugs w/drink.<br /><br />I would say this Monster High School set was a huge hit with my kids and a must for any Monster High fans. It is definitely a well made product and if I had to spend the money on it I would have to conclude I wouldn't have been disappointed with the product. It came with plenty of accessories and opens up to be quite roomy. In my opinion it is made pretty sturdy and I love the fact that it closes up to fit under a bed or lay on a shelf in the closet. It is true the accessories don't fit in it when it is closed up, but if they made it to close with the accessories it wouldn't be as compact as it is.<br /><br />Approximate Measurements:<br /><br />When opened the 2 rooms combined measure approx 31\\" wide and 15\\" in depth, the middle wall is roughly 13 1/2\\" high, containing casket lockers and a doorway on one side and classroom with beakers & chalkboard on the other. The creepateria is roughly 16 1/2\\"wide and the classroom is roughly 15\\" wide. The top floor is roughly 12 1/2\\" wide by 7 3/4\\" depth with the wall being 12\\" high at the highest point.<br /><br />When closed: It measures roughly 18\\" high,at highest peak, 15 1/2\\" wide and a 4\\" depth.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Okay, I'm interested. Enjoyed the Harry Potter series. Like what I've seen of Ms Rowling in public. Book sounds interesting.<br /><br />But 17.99 for an ebook???<br /><br />Can we please have sensible ebook pricing?<br /><br />Won't be buying this until it goes under 9.99 :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the app for Pinterest and use it on my Kindle. The only thing I don't like is the inability to change the default board cover. If you can do it, I haven't figured out how to yet.
0345803507|1.0|I can't even articulate how horrid this woman's writing style is.  Empty.  Shallow.  Repetitive.  Trite.  Cliche.  Dull.  It's like she simply copied various phrases and sentences from other romance novels and put them together along with a terribly childish and unrealistic story line.  Really, it's like reading a preteen's diary.<br /><br />Flat characters.  Mary Sue, Mary Sue, Mary Sue.<br />Unbelievable events that seem pulled out of thin air.<br />Empty conflict between characters that MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.<br /><br />In short, nothing happens in the story.  It's all filler and fluff, and badly written fluff at that.  After forcing myself through the first book, I had to skim through the last two.  I skipped almost all of the \\"sex\\" (I can't even call it that - I don't know what it was), and most of the character interaction between the guy and the girl.  Trust me, there's nothing there worth reading.<br /><br />The epilogue seemed to be even more poorly written than the rest of the story, and the bonus material was downright embarrassing.  This author has absolutely no idea how to get into a character's head in a believable, authentic way.  She's just repeating things she's read from other works.<br /><br />. . . this woman is very, very lucky that I did not pay for her garbage.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I LOVE Pinterest anyway. This app is good for casual use, but it sometimes had problems loading. And you cant do certain things like edit boards and board covers. But overall good.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is great when it works, but it tends to crash often. That is the only con I experienced while using it on my KF
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am so happy i ordered this movie when I saw it on Amazon. I watched it in 3D when it came in the mail and was not dissapointed. The artwork on the cover is really cool. And I can put the digital copy on my Itunes. Over, this is a fantastic buy, and I would highly recommend it to anybody on the fence.

B0083Z614S|5.0|I was really really happy with this book. Great story!! Definitly going to look for other books by this author.
B007THA4FI|2.0|To start, this is my blog before I read a significant portion of the novel:<br /><br />\\"It's no secret to those who know me that I am not a huge fan of the Harry Potter novels. I have all of them except the last two on my shelf but couldn't/didn't read past Book II. Since so many hailed the novels as children's books that adults can enjoy too, I decided to give them a read years ago,because I love the fantasy genre so much. Then later after the first couple of movies I decided to watch the first, I fell asleep. That was the end of my effort to try and like Harry Potter. Needless to say, if the novels encourage reading in children, that alone is reason enough to throw some admiration JK Rowling's way. So yesterday, JK Rowling enters the adult fiction genre with her latest book, The Casual Vacancy. I am going to read it so I can write a review and since I was never a fan of the Harry Potter books, I might actually like this one, we'll see. After reading all of the \\"professional critics\\" reviews I must agree with a person who criticized the critics in the comments section of a blog saying:<br /><br />\\"These reviewers have just made themselves look stupid. I imagine a 10-year-old HP fan would would have a similar reaction. \\"Where is Harry? What about Dumbledore?\\" They are professional critics who should be reviewing the book for what it is, not what it isn't.\\"<br /><br />Some of the reviews include:<br /><br />\\"And forget trying to find a ­character resembling Harry or Hermione.\\" --Henry Sutton, the Mirror<br /><br />\\"It's that the characters in The Casual Vacancy feel so much less fully imagined than the ones in the Harry Potter epic.\\" --Michiko Kakutani, the New YorkTimes<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter fans may long for a few more unicorns, though.\\" --David Sexton, the Evening Standard<br /><br />(I'm mentally adding in many of the Amazon reader reviews as well because many of the 1-star reviews were due to the pricing and/or by people that didn't read one sentence of the novel, which is not fair, especially when there's a sample available for free. Those comments (I won't dare call them reviews) are for chat forums not the review section)<br /><br />I may not have liked the Harry Potter books that I read (or movies I attempted to watch) but at least I have the sense enough to start reading it knowing full well that it's not a children's book & that it is in no any way related to Harry Potter. Surely, the famed, erudite book critics of the New York Times, LA Times or  New York Daily News received the memo that The Casual Vacancy  was not Harry Potter Book VIII, right? What were these reviewers thinking?  Many of the reviews are simply unfair. This book has to be read with a fresh set of unbiased, non- Harry Potter spectacles and evaluated on it's own merits. If the writing is dull or characters under/over developed fine, but references to the Harry Potter world are ludicrous. I can completely understand those who simply don't like this book, for reasons unrelated to the Harry Potter series, but when I see reviews replete with statements about hogwarts, magic & wizards it's more than disappointing from a professional reviewer. You just can't compare The Casual Vacancy to Harry Potter because there is no comparison. Last I checked...that's called comparing apples & oranges. Now obviously, this is not the case for every review, but many of them have this bias. I'm going to read this new adult novel from J.K. Rowling, but you better believe, that if I don't like it, it will be simply because it's not a good book, not because a lingering nostalgia & appetite left over from Harry Potter needs to be fed. Ijs...\\"<br /><br />Now that I've read some of this novel, I can state that based on it's own merits, I don't like it at all. It's dystopian plot/setting is not the problem but rather her ability to keep our attention w/o graphic sex, pedophilia...etc. I don't have a problem with such topics but when the writing is poor, inclusion of such things screams \\"excuse my bad writing, but the story is good/has shocking elements\\".I didn't make it through the entire book (and I read fast) because it just was not worthy of my time but I read enough). The characters are underdeveloped, the dialogue is boring, there's too much profanity (for my taste)& some of the figurative language is weak (Sliced his head like a demolition ball\\") - Really J.K.???. There's not enough sentence structure diversity (many sentences start off with \\"Barry said....Barry____...(for example) - she needed to change it up some, sorry. The only reason that I didn't give it only one star is because I can think of books that are worse. I'm not going to say that she should go back to children's fantasy as some have suggested, because there are a lot of famous authors who simply have that one (or more) bad book (and that's somewhat arrogant, could any of those reviewers have written this book better?), but most certainly a course on writing fiction for adults would be my recommendation to her. Hey, as a writer myself (soon to be published)I know that no matter how many books one sells or how famous a writer becomes, you never stop learning. The day you think you know it all is the day that you fail. Now, I'm not saying that's her attitude by any means, but writing for adults is different from writing for children and I'm just not sure she understands that. Adults/Young Adults are just as concerned about the writing as they are the story/creativity. I applaud her effort & tackling a new genre for adults & hopefully the next adult novel will be better. As for me, I won't abandon J.K. Rowling altogether but I hope the writing is better the next time around & not mediocre yet successful in sales because of her name's staying power. Hope this is helpful.<br /><br />[...]ings screams \\"excuse my bad writing, but the story is good/has shocking elements\\".I didn't make it through the entire book (and I read fast) because it just was not worthy of my time but I read enough). The characters are underdeveloped, the dialogue is boring, there's too much profanity (for my taste)& some of the figurative language is weak (Sliced his head like a demolition ball\\") - Really J.K.???. There's not enough sentence structure diversity (many sentences start off with \\"Barry said....Barry____...(for example) - she needed to change it up some, sorry. The only reason that I didn't give it only one star is because I can think of books that are worse. I'm not going to say that she should go back to children's fantasy as some have suggested, because there are a lot of famous authors who simply have that one (or more) bad book (and that's somewhat arrogant, could any of those reviewers have written this book better?), but most certainly a course on writing fiction for adults would be my recommendation to her. Hey, as a writer myself (soon to be published)I know that no matter how many books one sells or how famous a writer becomes, you never stop learning. The day you think you know it all is the day that you fail.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game to exercise you brain, and the free hints help with the really hard puzzles. It has a great look and feel as well.
0671449028|5.0|I love this book.  It is creative and has great pictures.  The rhymes throughout are sweet and it has a good rhythm. My daughter is not yet a year old, but I hope that she enjoys it as she grows as much as I like to read it to her.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|i realy love this.<br />most of the zombie movies, serie's i look sceptical becaus all movies look the same. but this is something special that keeps you hanging to the screen and i realy love to watch it
0316228532|4.0|FIVE STARS (Though Amazon is only allowing me to give it 4 for some reason).  I finished reading this book about eight hours ago, and I find myself still haunted by it.  A gritty version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" set on a street much like Privet Drive, it is a challenging book.  Yes, it is a tragedy, foreshadowed from the beginning, but elaborate plot twists are not the point.  The point is the characters.  You won't like them at first, and you are not meant to.  Rowling unveils the way in which we are all cabined off from compassion by our own self-centered dramas.  She takes you on a journey of your own failings, and it's a cruel and unfortunately accurate journey.  But then she surprises you with compassion, even for some of her most unlikeable characters, even for you.  For example, this sentence:  \\"How awful it was ... the way tiny ghosts of your living children haunted your heart; they could never know, and would hate it if they did, how their growing was a constant bereavement.\\"  All she asks is that you have the compassion for others that she has shown for you.  You finish the book with a series of \\"if onlys,\\" because so many of the characters have the chance to avert tragedy, and fail.  If only, you can't help think, Hagrid was there, with his pink umbrella -ella -ella.  But this is the real world, and somebody like us has to rescue the boy under the stairs.  Rowling doesn't leave us without hope, however.  As in the original \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" you also finish the book with an indelible sense of what one imperfect person CAN do.    After you read this book, I suggest you meet someone like Krystal, perhaps starting here:  [...]
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I've built LEGOs for the last 20 years of my life and this is by-far one of the best construction sets out there.  When I was little I dreamt about owning the Lego Space Shuttle, and after reading some of the reviews on this particular set (compared with the 10213), and I agree that this is even better than that one (more accurate and some cool features).  From the moment I opened the Amazon box, I was stunned...the packaging is huge and very pretty. ;)  All of the bags are the standard lego bags, and the instructions are in two packets.  Also, the stickers are pretty detailed as well.<br /><br />I will say that Amazon had an amazing deal on several lego sets including this one, and I've never received a brand new lego set where each block was about $0.05 each (I paid $78.00 for this one).  Since I was still looking to buy this over the last couple of weeks, the drop in price from $99.99 to $78.00 just made me commit faster.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain set and perfect for any one over 12+ and will go great in any Lego set now and in the many years to come!
0553381695|3.0|The story is interesting but tons of buildup. I don't know if I'll read the next book. But if you're in for a long, winding story that jumps around quite a bit, this is a good book. It has the same feel as the Sword of Truth and the Wheel of Times series.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Its a awesome game MUST GET GAME!!!!!!One of the best games I have on my kindle fire!!!! and the good part is that it's free!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best way to waste time since the advent of Angry Birds, and this app makes wasting time on the go very, very easy. Wish it loaded a bit faster, but that's my only complaint.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|GENIUS!! Can not speak highly enough of this film. It has all the elements for a classic -well written, well acted, well directed, and supremely edited film.﻿ I am so appreciative that Tim Burton put his money behind this one, and took the risk many other producers would have passed on. Fantastic choice for cast -with strong characters. This film is full of meaningful one-liners that speak to the better part of our humanity. Outstanding Action sequences and cinematography. Truly an AMAZING film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a simple calculator. Very handy. I use it on my kindle fire. I haven't had any problems with it at all.
1609611543|5.0|I've been trying many of Dr. Davis' recommendations and results are occuring.It is<br />a strange thing not to have wheat in my diet and I used to eat those whole grain<br />breads every day like most people. I got several new flours in several alternate<br />recipes are edible on the first try. Jalapeno Cornbread is great with gluten free<br />oat flour, almond flour cookies and a egg base bread mix I got on Amazon. Many gF<br />item are available on Amazon and in regular grocery stores too.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love this movie, but I love every movie that Sherwood puts out. It is great family entertainment. It makes you think about whether there is more you can do to be a good person or a good parent. I think every Christain should watch this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Won't repeat all the rave reviews; simply put, one of the best I've read!  Tried to read to a chapter end, turn off Kindle and go to sleep... Got up a hour or so later because I HAD TO see what happened next... Great book, great characterization, and best of all, a really great read!!!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|After the first bock I'm glad I read on to darker cause it has more of a story to it! Worth a read.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Repetitive, lacking in a true storyline, and raunchy. It seems the writer's vocabulary is limited, she uses the same word over and over again to describe Christian.  She has already stated he is mercurial numerous times, but she keeps repeating it over and over.  The over and over sex scenes began more bearable as I skipped over them.  If only there was a storyline that included more than sex, this book just might justified as the best seller it is.<br />I was given the trilogy via gift card so I decided to read it to see what the clamor is all about. If I were to think about purchasing this book, I would pay attention to my inner god as she was holding up a neon sign above her head that said: \\"Move along, there is nothing to see here.\\"
B000002G8J|5.0|I love his easy, laid back grooves and his soft, smooth, sincere vocals.  What the front photo 'promises', the music inside delivers: a homey and familiar place to relax and enjoy ourselves.  From beginning to end it pleases as no other E.C.  album has, until his latter day collaboration with J.J.Cale.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I will admit that I purchased this trilogy out of wondering what the clamor was all about. I also have a standard premise that I will not stop reading a book in the middle of it, even if I am not impressed. I am giving this book 3 stars simply because 3/4's the way through this book a plot actually seemed to emerge. I am not impressed with the BDSM lifestyle and pretty much find it disgusting. I do not have fantasy thoughts about this lifestyle and it does not interest me. I will admit that as this part of the book began to evolve I was actually ready to not even continue reading it. There are parts of this book that I did find attractive and stayed with me, but overall, if I were to think about purchasing this book, I would pay attention to my inner god as she was holding up a neon sign above her head that said: \\"Move along, there is nothing to see here.\\"<br /><br />P.S. I have given in and I will be reading the other two books in this trilogy and writing individual reviews on each.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|The camera work in this documentary is truly exceptional. It's equal to the quality of the fish and skill of Jiro and his sons. The underlying theme of dedication to (perhaps) the point of obsession is what left me with an unsettled feeling. I truly admire the skill and artistry of what Jiro does, but I don't know if I sensed that the sons held the same depth of love for the work.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Chris
0316228532|5.0|This is a novel in a very English tradition; it has echoes of Dickens, of George Meredith, of Evelyn Waugh. Post-World War II, it has notes of John Mortimer's Paradise Postponed and more than a few hints of Martin Amis. Rowling sets her nominally political tale about a local concil election in a setting that contains both the beauty of a traditional English village - Pagford - and the grit of an industrial city - Yarvil - inextricably linked, as the history of England includes the green and pleasant lands and the dark Satanic mills. She people both towns and tells the interwoven tales of many families, contrasting the middle class and the poor. What is unique about this book are the combined voices of the teenagers who inhabit it: Krystal, Andrew, Sukhvinder, Fats, and Gaia. These are young people struggling to survive and find a way to successful adulthood - some will make it and some won't. While Rowling can be somewhat humorous in portraying the imperfect adults in this novel, she is serious about the children and depicts them with knowledge, empathy. The most poignant character is the most desperate, Krystal Weedon, who came to remind me in many ways of Bill Sykes' Nancy. She is a true English heroine for modern times. The conversations of flawed parents and their desperate children are gripping and memorable. I cried at the end of this book and I'm not sure at all why reviewers are calling it a black comedy.  The images of Krystal and her young brother Robbie at the end of the book will stay with you for a long time. HIghly recommended.
0812548094|1.0|It´s a shame that I bought the first box set with the 3 first books in the series. This second book is better that the first, but it still terrible, just terrible. Hard to finish. Very child-like (not for adults). It is not a believable story. And in case you are wondering, I love Game of Thrones, The Wheel of Time, The Name of the Wind series, and The Way of Kings. SO it is not that I do not like fantasy, only that I did not like these books.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Underated, somewhat unknown but what a powerful man! I saw him in 2009 during his last tour and he puts on a show which better than men a third of his age.  It was a  rich and fulfilling show.  Leonard is your man!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds Fever! Keeps me company on days that drag and it gets very addicting.  Good for that time you have nothing to do...
B008B0QH5S|4.0|I clearly remember in March of 1986 first hearing \\"West End Girls\\" and thinking, in my 13 year old brain, who is this? I have never looked back. A late entry to the new wave movement of the late 70's/early 80's, the Pet Shop Boys came along around the time Erasure came along, and together, they have stood the test of time.<br /><br />I don't understand the negative reviews or the glowing reviews. \\"Elysium\\" is a solid Pet Shop Boys effort, but it is neither their worst offering or their best offering. Each of their proper albums is pretty good with a few great ones in there.<br /><br />It didn't take me very long to like \\"Elysium\\" at all. In fact, musically, it is similar to 2002's \\"Release\\" and, yes, 1990's \\"Behaviour\\". It's not a crime to compare it to those two albums because the truth is, that's what this album is similar to. It seems every decade the boys take time out to make a softer, more reflective and moody album, and \\"Elysium\\" is this decade's offering.<br /><br />\\"Leaving\\" starts the album off in that somber mood discussing a love that has ended but still haunts the protagonist. \\"Invisible\\" looks at aging and how someone who was once considered the life of the party is now 'invisible' to everyone--much like the duo's career in a way, especially in the U.S. \\"Winner\\", the first single, is a rousing anthem tailor made for the summer Olympics earlier this year. \\"Your Early Stuff\\" is a wry and witty look at Pet Shop Boys critics (including their early fans, too, I suppose)--it's not unlike \\"Yesterday, When I Was Mad\\" from 1993's \\"Very\\" in terms of sarcastic bite. \\"A Face Like That\\" is vintage Pet Shop Boys, probably the one track here that most closely resembles something found on \\"Please\\", \\"Actually\\" or \\"Introspective\\". \\"Breathing Space\\" is just that--a ballad about taking time out in your life to get to that zen place in your mind.<br /><br />\\"Ego Music\\" is yet another scathing commentary on today's musical artists and their fake generosity. \\"Hold On\\" is the Broadway musical track, replete with backing chorus. \\"Give It A Go\\" is the most unusual track here in that the boys attempt what sounds like a Motown throwback, and I actually liked it--something different, and that's a good thing. \\"Memory Of The Future\\" is a nice electro number. \\"Everything Means Something\\" to me, is the weakest track here, but its presence does not detract from the overall feel of the album. Lastly, \\"Requiem In Denim And Leopardskin\\" is a familiar sounding Pet Shop Boys track that I believe is about the demise of either punk rock or 80's hair bands.<br /><br />So, is \\"Elysium\\" \\"Please\\", \\"Actually\\", \\"Very\\" or \\"Bilingual\\"? No. Those are their finest works. Is it \\"Introspective\\" or \\"Fundamental\\" or \\"Yes\\"? No. Those are their weakest works. Really, I think it comes closest to \\"Release\\"--good, a change of pace, but not their best work. At this point, I issue a challenge to the boys--make an album no one would expect--an \\"Achtung, Baby\\". It's not like you have anything to lose at this point. Everyone knows what to expect now, so throw a curve ball. I have some ideas like working with Trent Reznor, Dido, Rick Rubin, Barry Gibb, Annie Lennox, George Michael, Howard Jones, Thomas Dolby, OMD, or if you really want modern, Skrillex. The possibilities are endless, really. I liked \\"This Used To Be The Future\\" from the bonus disc on \\"Yes\\" with Phil Oakey of The Humand League--that was brilliant.<br /><br />Anyway, here is how \\"Elysium\\" compares with the Pet Shop Boys' previous works:<br /><br />1986 Please: Four Stars<br />1987 Actually: Five Stars<br />1988 Introspective: Three Stars<br />1990 Behaviour: Four Stars<br />1993 Very: Five Stars<br />1996 Bilingual: Four Stars<br />1999 Nightlife: Four Stars<br />2002 Release: Four Stars<br />2006 Fundamental: Three and a Half Stars<br />2009 Yes: Three Stars<br />2012 Elysium: Four Stars<br /><br />1986 Disco: Three Stars<br />1994 Disco 2: One Star<br />2003 Disco 3: Four Stars<br />2007 Disco 4: One Star<br /><br />1995 Alternative: Five Stars<br />2012 Format: Four Stars<br /><br />1991 Discography: Four Stars<br />2003 PopArt: Five Stars<br />1995 Alternative: Five Stars<br />2012 Format: Four Stars<br /><br />1991 Discography: Four Stars<br />2003 PopArt: Five Stars

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love the game.  Very addicting and can forget time spent.  For the price, its worth it.  I highly recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Glassic King, almost as good as \\"IT\\" and better than \\"The Stand\\". He definitely does his homework when researching an era. I like that he referenced locations from his other novels.
