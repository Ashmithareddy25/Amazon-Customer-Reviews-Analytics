B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun and challenging.  A nice change from the pigs!  Instead there are birds, monkeys and other surprises, along the way.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|How can you rate a classic like this.  If you love this movie you need it in Blu-ray.  This is a must buy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked this book the most.  The book was very hard to put down.  It also is one of those books where you need to be a bigger person morally.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|What a great story that was supported by intrigue and detail that did not require sweeping landscapes or epic battles.  I enjoyed every moment and most important it kept me turning the pages.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|You will enjoy this film perfectly drawn,clear audio,good voice acting and a excellent story.<br />I believe part 2 will be as good.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|How do I exit this app?! No menu bar on kindle fire.  I tried reinstalling with no luck. Lost all of my data. Anyone else having this issue?
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I was definatly disappointed that Avast! will not work on my Micro Cruz tablet running android 2.2. I hope they write a program for it as I have used Avast since 2006 with total confidence. There is no better program available and with updates every 4 hours Ive never caught a virus (knock on wood). I use Avast! at home and install it on every computer I sell.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Great movies and it works great on my dvd.  As always Amazon delivered it when it was supposed to.<br /><br />The were no flaws on my DVD, brand new in the package.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
0525478817|3.0|The novel itself is great, but I received the book with a large scratch right through the front cover. It isn't in the best quality, especially when it's intended as a gift.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show. Waiting for more. Very intense, thoughtful. 12 more words for what ???. The show is good. I am not a big writer or talker for that matter. So, what would more could I tell you?
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Now I see why Tatum Channing gets so much hype :). If you like to see men with beautiful bodies (exception is Matthew, Yuk) strut across a stage, this is the movie for you! Not much to the plot and the acting was fair. I showed parts to my elderly mom and she thought it was porn or x-rated. Nothing of the kind. In this man dominated world, women bodies are always on display in the movie and tv world. Rarely do we get a movie that displays men bodies to admire. It was a reason why Team Jacob/Taylor Lautner got so many fans when he took off his shirt. I say Magic Mike 2!!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Caught this on tv by accident one night and just had to own it.  Great story, great cast and the quality is amazing
6304698623|5.0|&#34;A Little Princess&#34; is a hidden gem ostensibly geared for the little girl audience, but which parents will find joyously entertaining as well. It's takes place in a boarding school in WWI-era New York City — not something you'd expect for a children's movie but the kids won't care and adults will find the period settings wonderfully lush down to the smallest details. (If green is your favorite color you've come to the right place). You can find plot descriptions elsewhere, but the great strength of the story – and it's all about the story, isn't it? – is the main character's (Sara Crewe) spirit, kindness and creativity. This is one plucky kid. She's an inspiration to the other girls at the school as well as those viewing this rich, wonderfully shot film. I bought the DVD to watch on Thanksgiving day with my three small nieces, ages 8, 6 and 3, and all but the little one were totally enthralled by it. This is a different type of &#34;princess&#34; movie, one that focuses on character rather than crowns and gowns. My nieces were talking about it long after the final credits rolled. Exceptional movies about the trials, tribulations and emotional bonding of young boys (&#34;Stand By Me,&#34; &#34;Sandlot&#34;) are more common. Similar movies for girls – not so much. &#34;A Little Princess&#34; is one of those rare films that will thrill young girls as well as stand up from all angles simply as an exceptional movie experience.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys CD sets a tone in our home that is relaxing. My children beg to put it in and we listen to it over and over and over again!
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I love this movie and I love Barbra Streisand. She is a remarkable actor and director. I try to see everything she works in, including TV.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|this was purchased for a friend who enjoys Susan Boyles music.  I know she will be thrilled. choice of songs seem appropriate.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was utterly amazed when I discovered The Piano Guys!  What talent!  What originality!  Each rendition of each song is masterfully played and beautifully arranged.  My 10 year old son is also a HUGE fan of them.  Try to pick out a favorite song....I dare you.  They are all awesome.  Check out their videos on their website or on YouTube.  Their website includes a snippet of the song and artists.  I can't say enough wonderful things about their music.  They are extremely talented and masterful at their craft.  And what great role models they are......all family men!
B000ELJBAK|4.0|All I'm gonna say is this: If you like the guitar work of David Gilmour, you're going to like this CD. Yes, it's dark and moody sometimes, but hasn't he always been? Just trust me, you will like it; and now, with the bonus feature of the recent re-mix, it's a win-win.
B009IF82SK|5.0|One of the funniest and best written shows on TV.  Sheldon and the crew are brilliant!  I recommend to anyone wanting a good laugh...
0765365278|5.0|This is exactly my kind of book.<br /><br />At first the sheer size of the novel was a bit daunting. At just over a thousand pages I've gotta say that I drug my feet a bit getting started--but let me tell you, once it picked up (which did not take long) I began to dread how close I was getting to the end.<br /><br />This world is a richly-built and thoroughly thought out one. The setting is a continent called Roshar whose countries are under constant threat of war. Theirs is a history full of lore and religious instability and as a result most people are unsure of what is true about their nation's past and what isn't. The land is cursed with severe weather known as \\"highstorms,\\" which are basically severe hurricanes and with these hurricanes comes a lot of myth and mysticism. It is not high-tech space age fantasy, but at the same time it is not entirely Tolkein-esque either. Just an alternate world with people like you and I living without industrial age technology but where \\"stormlight\\" (a byproduct of the highstorms) picks up the slack. Most of the book takes place in a war camp and in what is essentially a library, two places that are easy to relate to as the necessities of either don't differ much no matter what your surroundings.<br /><br />I fell in love with the entire main cast of this novel. And the minor cast. And the villains. Just...wonderfully written characters, all of them. Oftentimes fantasy writers fall prey to making their characters too perfect. Too heroic. Too ideal. But all of Sanderson's characters were really well fleshed out and, more importantly, very flawed. He was very good at showing their inner turmoil regarding the sometimes horrible things they were doing. And he delved right into all of the politics and strategical maneuvering that goes on in the upper (and lower) echelons of society.<br /><br />And he did a good job of mixing action with intrigue, theology, philosophy, and just all around solid discourse that leaves the reader reflecting on one's own life and world. The surprises and twists revealed at the end make the anticipated wait for the next book torturous. Supposedly not going to be out until November 2012...I think I will need to murder the friends who turned me on to this book without warning me that it was a series-in-progress. Gah!<br /><br />All in all, if you have even a passing interest in fantasy, I recommend picking this one up.ting on one's own life and world.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this on Amazon when it was on sale for their Musical deal of the day :) and what a great purchase this was! I was wonderfully surprised when I saw on the box that this also includes the 45th Anniversary Soundtrack CD! I had no idea that it was also included! I was so happy because I was about to buy the CD too! Also, I collect music boxes and I loved that a hand painted music box was part of this collection. I love this collection, it has so many wonderful goodies and well worth the price. Even though I got it for a lower price than what it is now, it's still totally worth its current price. I bought this along with the Singin' in the Rain collector's edition box set which costed twice the $$, but hands down this Sound of Music box set was the better purchase. Totally satisfied with my purchase :)
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It is not in his top ten, but a fair to good read. He has written so many excellent books, maybe my expectations were a little high. I will continue to buy his books..
B009LA1R34|5.0|Es un disco que tiene varios ritmos musicas conocidas y otras no, pero la verdad es un exelente disco con la musica la canciones, interpretacion, y sobre todo que no te aburres que lo pones a cada momento y no te aburres.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|this is a great album; beautiful music, awesome arrangements, and each song has it's own style. Myself, my husband and my kids all love the Piano Guys on YouTube. Listening to the CD is the next-best thing.
B00ADYYY50|1.0|I was really anticipating this album.  I loved Rolling Papers and Taylor Allderdice, but his lyrics on ONIFC are bad to the point of being distracting.  He lacks his usual flow and cadence, the words don't rhyme well, and the content is completely vacuous.  The production is pretty good, but he really phoned in his performance on the lyrics.  Too bad.
030758836X|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read, and I have read thousands. There is no character in the entire book that I cared one wit about, and would not have been upset at all if they all bit the dust. The ending was as big a letdown as most Steven King books.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Imaginative, great graphics and challenging.  Good for all ages, however,  very young children may find it too frustrating.  I would recommend it for children 6 and up.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Was a bit slow at times but over all glad I watched it. If you like the bond series you will enjoy it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I enjoy listening to this album from The Piano Guys.  It makes me feel like I am listening to music from Heaven!  It uplifts and inspires.  I can't wait until their next one comes along.
B000VZV58U|4.0|great album great songs great beat great vocals great to hear early tom the band sounds tight if you like tom petty you will like this album
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bought this book to take on a long trip.  Couldn't put it down.  I just bought the prequel and hope it is as good as the first 5 sections.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE this album, and I have been playing it constantly since it arrived! I have so many people who are now listeners. For the record, this is amazing study music!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Dying for book three - Entwined In You - to come out!  Gideon and Eva are made to be together.  First series I read after Shades and thought it was terrific.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It started with the Cello Wars on Youtube and we have seen every video since. My whole family loves the music and we debate which song we like best. The music is even more amazing when you realize it is just 2 guys a piano and what seems like 100 different cellos. This is fun, family friendly music.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is totally incredible. The music, the ambience... you feel the love they themselves feel for their music spreading through every recorded chord and sound. This is the perfect Xmas gift for the music lover! Greetings from Québec, Canada!
B000FC10MU|4.0|Very interesting ride.  Would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story.  I will be reading more books by this author in the future.
B004SBULWE|4.0|You want to save battery life and wireless airtime... you need a task killer ... unfortunately. many apps will come back to life after killing them... but this is a way of at least knocking them down temporarily
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our whole family loves this CD and loves to watch \\"The Piano Guys\\" on Youtube.  My two boys (age 13 and 10) ask nearly daily if they have posted a new video or song!  Enjoy!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows but I'm not always able to watch and they stopped showing the first few episodes on demand. This is my go to site for all things!
B000R3E2WW|4.0|This movie was so good, it left me a little down at the end.  A great perspective and character came to life.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If I could make a wish for the perfect way to fill my heart with peace and joy I could not have wished for anything that is better than this new CD.  I love their music, I love the arrangement, and I love the peaceful, happy way I feel when I listen to it.  Thank you Piano Guys!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|What a good movie. Not only for the boys but girls also. We all enjoyed it and like to see it over and over
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love Will Farrell and I love Zooey Deschanel they are a knockout comedic duo. Elf is my favorite holiday movie.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|So happy that they made a red, curly hair girl movie. Its about time. My girl has curly hair and she was so happy about the girl having curly hair.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good easy read...typical Grisham book. If you are Grisham fan you will like this. If you try to over analyze the plot, you will be disappointed. Just read it and enjoy....
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|See what I wrote for Sea Change...ditto  Love all his movies!!!  Need more Jesse Stone movies!!!  Share them with friends and relatives!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is fresh sounding music with a combination of classical and pop. I've seen their music videos as well. They do a great job.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I don't like the fact that it left me hanging!!!  The story was well written and gripping but it just suddenly came to an end without any conclusion.
0525952926|5.0|As with all his books, I couldn't put it down. He is a very compelling story teller. I can't wait for the next one!
B004SDEP38|5.0|Great app for my tablet, I use it almost all the time. Very good app I like it very much
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is the most bestest most absolutely best MLP game ever! I cant think of another MLP app that could possibly ever beat it! not ever!
0767817710|5.0|Who doesn't like a woman that can shoot just like the guys and also look good doing it. My wife really likes it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|You hear a song on the radio and you think... gosh, what song could possibly top this one?! Well, there is proof that when The Piano Guys touch a song, potentially mash-it-up with another or give it a PG twist - it can get better. This album is the proof! I first watched their youtube videos but couldn't resist buying their music. It is totally worth it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This does a good job I use it on my tablet, and I love saving music from you tube on it.
B0061S073A|5.0|Before I found this app my 3 yr old figured out how to access Amazon videos on my Kindle Fire.  He managed to buy $140.00 worth of cartoons in the ten mins I was in the kitchen making lunch for him while he was in the dining room.  Now with this app we no longer have to worry about things like that happening!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like this app, the basic app came with my tablet by default this is a great update to it
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys take what many people would consider elevator music and make it fun and interesting. Their passion really does come out in their songs. Awesome!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great app for my tablet, I use it almost all the time. Very good app I like it very much
B0062W5U32|4.0|Complete and cheaper than paper version.<br />Easy to use on iPads.<br />Could be better: tables and drawings when we use zoom.
145551389X|5.0|Terry Richardson did an amazing job capturing Lady Gaga in her most intimate time.  This book is wonderful and highly recommended for any Gaga fan!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I liked this book because it focused on the exponentially-growing power of the internet.  It depicts Google as a paragon in both technology and the way it treats their employees - I wonder to what extent this is true.  The book is snappy, but the plot didn't all hang together for me.  It is cleaver and imaginative, the ease at which things get handled is a bit unbelievable
B005SV9X22|5.0|lady Gaga is such an inspiration and I love this DVD of her performance at Madison Square Garden.  Perfectly perfect!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I loved the album! I have the album on repeat while I'm working out at the gym. I love both of their voices.
B005HSL626|5.0|honestly guys you had this question coming at you for a while now. At of all the fruits you put a watermelon being cut in half, while your competitors use a more likeable fruit, the apple for example, apples are the fruit of America and the peach is the fruit of Georgia, but that isn't the case you should use a unique unknown fruit like a corndog maybe you would get better reviews. thank you for your time.
B000IDJNIY|4.0|Lisa Bonet is amazing, and Robert De Niro is the perfect choice.  And, I'll watch anything that includes Mickey Rourke....he is just great in whatever.....
B00020BVXI|2.0|I was expecting 3 disks... only received 2. Will be sending this product back. Now I need to find the correct item in time for Christmas.
B0012PDVUS|5.0|There aren't enough stars to rate Blade Runner appropriately.....this is one of the all time best ever movies made.  It ranks up there with Star Wars, Grand Canyon, and The Quiet Earth.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|If you are a fan of MItch Albom's books you will not be disappointed with this one.  Insightful, thought provoking, and as always, impossible to put down until you are finished.
B009EE5SQ4|4.0|I love this movie; I watch it often, just because it is so good when the bad guys are so bad and the good guys are so good and right wins in the end.
B001EN71CW|5.0|A Great series that was way to short.  It is like an outer space western.  The Character are very entertaining but the series ended before some of the character backgrounds were explained.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This game is great. Highly addictive if you like puzzle games. I would have given it 5 stars if the automatically progressed to the next puzzle. Right now you have to do it yourself. Other than that it is great.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I received a Verso Prologue E-Reader Cover from Amazon Vine for my Kindle Touch and liked it so well that I ordered the same style for the Kindle Fire I just won on an author's blog. (Lucky me!)<br /><br />I love this cover. It is absolutely gorgeous. Like a fine old book with a rich Cabernet, \\"animal-friendly leather\\" embossed cover stamped in gold. It is fashioned with hand-distressed markings...like that favorite old volume tucked away on your bookshelf. Inside a microfiber lining protects your e-reader screen from scratches and four silicone elastic straps, guaranteed for the life of the device, hold it securely in place. A pocket on the inside cover holds tickets, receipts or whatever.<br /><br />This Verso Prologue is larger, designed to fit the Kindle Fire (standard version, not the HD).<br /><br />The cover easily stays open and flat for reading, yet closes snugly without a clasp. It is small enough to fit handily in my purse but smart-looking enough that I want to keep it out. I am delighted with both quality and performance. Never has my Kindle reading experience been so much fun.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1400096936|5.0|Since other reviewers have provided basic plot recaps, I will skip that. Often I hear people say that they don't \\"waste time reading fiction\\" and only read non-fiction.<br /><br />Power of the Dog is a perfect case of a story well told that perfectly illustrates why the war on drugs has been an absolute failure, yet politicians continue to pour trillions of dollars down this black hole.<br /><br />Anyone who reads this book will see the wisdom of legalizing drugs and taxing it, the same as we do alcohol and tobacco. Once legalization happens the cartels will no longer have a reason to exist and almost all of this horrible violence and corruption will stop. Plus, of course, an expense will immediately be transformed into a profit center, a source of tax revenue.<br /><br />Of course, many people have long wondered why the alcohol prohibition only lasted 10 years before everyone realized what a mistake it was, and why the war on drugs is now 40 years old and it is no more successful at getting people to quit using drugs than prohibition was successful at getting people to quit drinking.<br /><br />Perhaps a lot of people have not thought about it much and have no clue why we continue, what the real connection is between various seemingly unrelated \\"news events\\" and just how much of a cash cow this has been for certain agencies who want to continue the cash flow of this failed war.<br /><br />I have never read a more compelling narrative about why we should change. This is one of those books I could not put down once I started and highly recommend it as a good read.
1444737090|5.0|I read this book while travelling by plane.<br />I very much enjoyed reading the story!<br />I would highly recommend the book if you are in<br />the mood for an easy read and uplifting story.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|so good... buy this movie. It will not disappoint. Action packed and funny and I need four more words... bye
B008FSCNTK|4.0|At first listen, I wasn't sure I liked this CD because it is not what you would expect to hear from Diana Krall.  But I shortly found myself tapping away at the steering wheel (yes, I was in my car) and very much enjoying the complex instrumental interplay that supports her sultry voice.  Good stuff!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I bought this as a companion e-reader version to the unabridged classic.  It is a great read to have in your digital library.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Exactly what I required; syncs with Google Calendar and provides all the look forward/back that I have requested to date. Highly recommend!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|So far this book is thrilling as the previous 2. I can't put it down. She is an awesome writer
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Few animated movies bring me to tears, but this one did!!! My ancestry is Ireland/Scotland and this movie really hit home with me!! It also reminded me of my granddaughter!!<br />You really must watch this!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I'm so glad Disney made a Highland Princess!!! I love the movie, it's currently my favorite. We watch it constantly around here
B00A19Z75S|5.0|I've often assumed that super successful people succeeded because they were exceptionally talented or were very intelligent. After reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, I realized what a huge mistake it is to make this assumption. It has the tendency to make me want to give up or not try as hard in my endeavors, because, what's the use if I wasn't born with the necessary gifts?<br /><br />  After reading Outliers it appears that talent is the least of the three elements needed for the upper echelons of achievement. Proper preparation is also required, but these two factors are not enough without the most crucial element: opportunity, the one thing that's almost completely out of our control.<br /><br />  As for talent and intelligence, consider this: In 1921, the creator of the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Lewis Terman, sorted through the records of 250,000 elementary and high school students and selected 1,470 children whose IQ scores were between 140 and 200 (100 is average, Einstein's was 150). He tracked their progress for the rest of his life and found that the majority ended up with ordinary careers. He was compelled to conclude that there is no connection between intellect and achievement.<br /><br />  In addition to intelligence and talent, one must have the proper amount of preparation. Before the Beatles became world-famous rock legends, they were given the chance to play in Hamburg, Germany between 1960 and 1962. They played at a club that required them to perform eight hours a night, seven days a week. The band performed live an estimated twelve hundred times before they took the world by storm in 1964. Most bands don't perform twelve hundred times in their entire careers. Several studies have concluded that 10,000 hours is the magic number for proper preparation.<br /><br />  \\"The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything...In study after study of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and what have you, this number comes up again and again...It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.\\"<br /><br />  But the most important aspect of success for these outliers is opportunity. John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan and eleven more Americans born in the 1830s are on the list of the top seventy-five richest people of all time, a list that includes Cleopatra, the last Czar of Russia, Nicholas II, and Bill Gates. Twenty percent of the people on this list were born in the same country and in the same decade.<br /><br />  And speaking of Bill Gates, he, Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer, Steve Jobs, and many of the tycoons of Silicon Valley were all born between 1953 and 1956, which put them at about twenty-one years old when the first personal computer hit the market in 1975. If these two groups of over-achievers had been born a decade earlier or a decade later, they would have never been in the right place at the right time. They would have missed the revolutions that were taking place.<br /><br />  According to Gladwell, success follows a predictable course. It's not the smartest or most talented who succeed, and it's not simply the most prepared. It's people who were given opportunities right at the time that they were most prepared to capitalize on them. In order to really succeed, you only have to be talented or smart enough, you have to be well prepared, and most crucially, you have to be given the opportunity.<br /><br />Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"udy after study of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and what have you, this number comes up again and again...It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.\\"<br /><br />  But the most important aspect of success for these outliers is opportunity.

0425263908|4.0|Loved the book, was compairable to Fifty shades of gray, with a softer story, would recommend reading to anyone who enjoyed fifty shades of gray.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I didn't like this movie! I don't know what the big deal is! It just didn't do it for me! No I don't have a reason!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|As I've said in other reviews, I only give 5 stars for life-changing, awe-inspiring books. This one I own in paperback and electronic version, and have recommended to anyone who will listen. This one is a life changer. Read it!
B000SEGEKI|5.0|The expectations were high, and I must say they delivered for the most part.  There was some really antiquated stuff there, and there was some Java stuff there (I have an aversion to Java), but aside from that, it had some pretty insightful stuff.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have a new found love for classical music because of The Piano Guys. I have an appreciation for it like never before with the musical mash-ups they've created. I dabbled with instruments as a kid but have recently signed up for lessons again. These guys have inspired me and reminded me how much I love music. I love watching them play as well because they put their emotions into every song. Great job guys, Thank so much for doing what you love and loving what you do. But most of all, thanks for sharing it with the world!
B00338QENI|5.0|Even if one is not into the science of the story, the real life events and experiences of the Lacks family are a compelling read.

B003K1EYM6|3.0|I purchased this for its ability to transfer video and photo to my IPad without having to go through iTunes.  The iOS 6.0 change to power output from the iPad does limit the usefulness when I am using CF cards from my canon eos.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have seen the videos and watched, and with this album I can enjoy it on the stereo system. If you are going to listen to this album, put it on a high quality sound system where the dynamics can be heard. Simple, amazing, music!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I learned more about the country and the civil War than I had since high school.  And i actually paid attention in high school. I learned something too about the song Battle Cry of Freedom, and the novel Ben Hur.  And now I can keep Stanton and Seward straight.

B005HSG3U6|1.0|Someone, please, state in the description somewhere that it only fits Kindle Fire and NOT Kindle Fire HD 7.  This product came up when I searched for Kindle Fire HD 7 cover and I assumed it would fit.  Amazon is good about returns and all, but I'd rather not waste my time ordering, returning, and re-ordering another product.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Came in perfect condition after shipping. Appreciated the speedy delivery and excellent service and plan on doing business again in the future.
B000F9RB8K|4.0|Though its a modern film, it's one the reminds me of the grand movies from Hollywood.  Well acted by Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt

B0013ND36G|3.0|Enjoyable movie that helps to better explain various aspects of the overall movie story.  Schwarzenegger still works some movie magic in it as well.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|I loved the way he developed people in the book. They became real to me as I read the story and the plot was very envolving.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|It shows its age from the aspect of the special effects, but will forever remain a favorite movie of mine
B007V65R54|5.0|I really like this book.  But I have a math degree.  If you throw out all the readers who are driven by statistics, I am sure the book gets a lower star average. Then again, I believe the book is geared for those with a slightly better understanding of odds.  So, maybe we should throw out all the readers that are not statistically driven and we will get the true signal, giving this book a 5 star.
B000L212HC|5.0|A wonderful and well acted movie. First time seeing it you'll never imagine where or how it'll end. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both great in it
B0053JJLLC|4.0|At first I was not sure about people being shrunk down into the micro world but it didn't take long for me to get caught up in the story. Micro took me on a very exciting adventure through a world that we walk over every day. It's a thrilling race to safety through an unknown land with terrifying creatures.<br />Another good read from Michael Crichton.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|By far this is the best of the Terminator movies.  Well worth finding the uncut/directors version for the additional scenes

B004G6TD8Y|4.0|\\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" displays Emerson, Lake and Palmer at their most pretentious and ostentatious, but I mean that in the kindest way. Their rendering of the Russian classical composer Modest Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" is an over-the-top example of prog rock at its arrogant, exploratory best -- or worst, depending on your point of view. Here's what I mean by that: Purists are going to hate it, and by purists I mean people who are purist classical music fans and purist rock 'n' roll fans. Both camps include individuals who think the two forms just should not mix. But non-purists are going to recognize it for what it is: A rock band with extraordinary musical chops attacking a classic with a mixture of reverence and aggression.<br /><br />ELP consisted of keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist/guitarist/vocalist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer. Collectively, the three of them were interested in all kinds of music, from classical to folk to rock to jazz and even blues. Lake also wrote some lovely pieces in the singer/songwriter mode, such as \\"Still ... You Turn Me On\\" and \\"From the Beginning.\\" Emerson had the strongest background in classical music, while Palmer was especially at ease playing jazz.<br /><br />Oddly, on this recording, Lake's performances stand out, which one would not expect, given that his focus lay elsewhere. Emerson and Palmer often drew a great deal of attention because they were both regarded as virtuosos on their respective instruments. But people then and now tend to forget what an accomplished musician Lake is, especially as an electric bassist. His growling, snarling undertones here may not be as flashy as the playing of his bandmates, but he drives the music very hard when that approach is called for.
B00A5052YE|5.0|This an excellent album, I like almost every song! Alicia doesnt disappoint on this album so you wont regret your purchase as you may with others.

B002VQ7PVS|4.0|In England, single mother Ruth is listlessly working on her doctorate, so happy with her job helping foreigners learn English that she goes for long periods forgetting her scholastic goal.<br /><br />Then her mother gives her the first part of her autobiography to read, and Ruth's life is turned on end. Sally Gilmartin is really Eva Delectoraskaya, a Russian refugee recruited before WWII as a spy for Britain. Her main assignment was in the United States, putting out propaganda to force the government to come to England's aid.<br /><br />Now, it's thirty years later, and someone is after Sally. Someone who doesn't want her to tell the truth about what really happened in America.<br /><br />Sally doles her story out to Ruth in folders, preparing her for the time when she begs Ruth's help to flush out her would-be killer.<br /><br />The first person section of the story is Ruth's. It's fascinating to follow her rather mundane existence with her son and students while her mother slowly seduces her with a third person account of forays into the minds of spies.<br /><br />The weak point of the plot was the fact Sally allowed Ruth access to her true story. It seemed to me Sally would want to keep her daughter safe from the people she feared most. Yet she deliberately drew her in. At the end, she does mention she didn't think of the harm that might come to Ruth, but with her background, her protest hangs rather feebly.<br /><br />But overall, it's one of the better books I've read lately.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Honestly, I didn't think TDKR would look that good on the KFHD. Once I saw the graphic, I said to myself this would be fun.<br />Pros:<br />Virtual joystick 10/10<br />Moves and softness 10/10<br />Voice Over: Original which makes it even better since the actors played their parts respectively.10/10<br />Another good point, the game doesn't freeze.<br /><br />cons:<br />Not yet found
B0016OMFPW|4.0|Nice....easy, cool jazz. I like Hargrove. This CD has him playing like he is enjoing what he's doing. I really like this music. Earfood is just that.  Music that tickles your ear.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you in your toes, a different twist at every turn. Messed up but decidedly understandable. Love isn't perfect. It's close to a nuclear reaction..
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love to listen to music while I study. I prefer instrumental music and this is great. Their mashups of classics and newer music make it fun. Easy to put on repeat and listen to multiple times. Check them out on youtube, then buy the CD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This author sure knows how to keep you reading all books in the series!  After reading this one, I had to find out what was going to happen in the third!  If you can put this book down and put it out of your head, you are stronger than me!
1439152802|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and although it took me a few days to get into the book after having had just read a different genre (I had been reading a lot of books recently that were historical fiction about various English rulers from 13th to 16th century and all the drama around the Tudor family, etc) I found that once I was 1/4 into the book...I couldn't put it down.  I read the rest of the book within a week!  Morton did a great job building all the characters in the book and connecting them without giving away their true connections and the mystery that the book tries to reveal until just the right moment.  I didn't feel like anything dragged on or was repeated, unlike some other books I've read when you wish the story would just get to the point and reveal what is happening.  The family and all the things that happened during WWI really helped to make the story interesting and believable.  I've also read some of her other books and enjoyed them too so I'm glad I read this one.  You won't be disappointed!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would give this app 5 stars, I just don't like the ads at the beginning of each game.  But that is what I can expect for getting a FREE App.  Other than the ads, this is a fun, typical solitaire game.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I saw it twice in theaters when it first came out and pre-ordered it way before it was actually released. It is one of those movies that, though it is intended for children, I can watch over and over again and still find hilarious and and heart wrenching every time.<br /><br />I did have an issue with the shipping because it was lost in transit somewhere and never came in but one call to Amazon and they got it all fixed up quickly and painlessly and sent me another copy free of charge that came in the very next day. I am very happy with the product and the company in general.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I just wanted to read this to see what all the hype was about.  I didn't care for all the detailed you know whats - but it was the underlying story...the behind the scenes story that kept me reading.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|this is a great CD - lady antebellum is such a great band and the music is loved by almost anyone/everyone!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|No trouble loading, no trouble finding friends, not as much advertising as being on a PC.  I love it!  I especially love that it is FREE.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is a very good show to watch online through Amazon. The price was reasonable & the picture quality was good. But since this show is often shot in dark settings, it is sometimes a little hard to see clearly. I should have tried it in HD even though it's more expensive, I probably will next time.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I don't understand why Amazon did not include a camera/video already installed in the Kindle Fire.  Very disappointing.  I am glad that it wasn't more than $2.00, but really, the price we pay for the Kindle Fire it SHOULD have been already included.  &#62;:-(
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My 5 year old was OVER THE MOON when he saw this game!!<br />I love these angry bird games, and I do not think  you even need to play with the cards and the rules and can just enjoy this as a stand alone toy!<br />I like the building aspect of the cards, for fine motor skills and problem solving with the younger kids.  Build what you see, and great activity in itself!<br />The blocks are great sizes, the details on the pigs and birds very engaging for fans of the game.  I like the addition of the \\"breakable\\" space helmet on one of the pigs for this version.<br />WE are fans of these games in our house.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't believe that this book was better than the first.  The first book was really good!  I was up until 2 a.m. reading this one because I could NOT put it down!!!
1439127700|5.0|Very informative and I recommend this book to anyone who loves politics.  Put a lot of interesting information on very complicated men and politics into an interesting read.  You may think you know;  but oh so much more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the first book reluctantly.  The second book I read because the first book lead me to it and then I was hooked.  Now after having finished the third book, I am glad it is over.  It was an exciting ride while it lasted, but I was glad to get out.
0061726834|5.0|Imagine a world where there is no love. Love is a disease. Love causes too many problems in society--jealously, anger, destruction. One must be cured of this \\"deadly disease.\\" The government dictates and controls everyone. Once a young adult turns eighteen years old, you are mandated to be fixed to erase the feelings of love within you. At this point, you do not have a choice in your life once you undergo the surgery. After your evaluation, you are matched with a mate and given an appropriate career that will suite you best. Your entire life is planned out for you. You do not have a voice in your future. New York Times bestselling author Lauren Oliver paints a unique, dystopian tale of a young girl, rebelling against the norms of society, for true love with an outsider from the Wild.<br /><br />\\"They say that the cure for love will make me happy and safe forever. And I've always believed them. Until now. Now everything has changed. Now, I'd rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years suffocated by a lie.\\"<br /><br />Lauren Oliver, born and raised in New York, grew up with two literature professors as parents. Persuaded to be creative early on in the arts, she began to develop her love for writing to expand on her love of reading. After creating sequels for the books she loved, she started to write her own stories. She began working at Razorbill, a Young Adult division of Penguin books, where she began to write her own story. Soon after, she decided to quit Razorbill to become a full-time writer.<br /><br />Going into Delirium, I had such high expectations because I previously read and loved Oliver's debut book Before I Fall, also a New York Times bestseller. Delirium, however, exceeded my high expectations with an intriguing, unique dystopian story with both lovable characters and a gripping storyline. The concept was crazy for me to read about at first, since I could not possibly imagine our society without love within it; this made the book both interesting and highly enjoyable to read. The dystopian genre is one of my favorites to read; after reading Delirium, it became one of my favorites of the genre.<br /><br />The beginning begins a little slow, which makes it a little hard to get into the story and relate to the characters at first. However if given the chance, the plot quickens by the middle and will leave you longing to know what will happen next. I was entirely engrossed, after the slightly slow beginning. I physically could not put the book down at one point and continued reading, until I reached the heart-pumping, unexpected ending. If you find yourself a little confused and bored at the beginning like I was, my advice to you is definitely continue reading. because it will quicken and get much better--to the point that you definitely will not regret finishing. Oliver does a great job of developing the backstory of Delirium, by beginning each chapter with little snippets from their law, history, and handbooks as well as quotes and poems of the society's culture. The first chapter begins with one from their law book, \\"The most dangerous sicknesses are those that make us believe we are well. - Proverb 42, The Book of Shhh.\\"<br /><br />Set in a futuristic Portland, Maine, Lena Holloway considers herself to be an average girl, no one special. About to turn 18 and graduate high school, she cannot wait to undergo the surgery to remove her of the disease of love, amor deliria nervosa, which the government believes to be the source of all the society's past problems. Her mother's death occurred because of the failure of love. Wanting to be like her cured older sister, she just wants to get the surgery as soon as possible, so she can be \\"normal\\" like the rest of society and to rid herself of the grief and pain she has felt her whole life. Her schooling and The Book of Shhh have taught her of the symptoms of catching the deliria of love. She does not know any better but to acceptthe preaching from the government. Anyone not cured of the disease is considered to be a rebel. The Invalids live in the Wild, a restricted area lying outside of Lena's perfectly controlled world. Traveling to the outside is strictly prohibited; a guarded, electric fence prevents this from happening--but not always...<br /><br />\\"Love: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That's what it is: an edge; a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.\\"<br /><br />Lena has never conversed with a boy, let alone touch one. Her society does not allow the two genders to interact or be in the presence of one another, until they are cured. However when Lena meets an older boy from the Wild, she begins to question everything she once thought she wanted: a set future with a suitable husband and a stable career that was handpicked for her by the government. Lena's best friend always rebels by sneaking out to listen to prohibited music and hang out with boys. Lena disapproves... until she meets Alex. She starts doing the unimaginable, begins to fall in love with the boy from the Wild.<br /><br />Starting to break the rules for once, she starts secretly meeting Alex at night. She begins to fall deep for the boy pretending to be cured. Alex tells Lena of his past and of the possible future for her if she decides to escape and refuse the cure. She begins to imagine her life in a new light. Having practically nothing to lose, she makes the brave decision to leave her society, she has always known, for the Wild with an Invalid. Coming up with a plan, they decide they will escape to live in the Wild together. Lena has never felt so sure about anything in her life before and cannot stop the spread of love that has infected her heart and soul. Their plan, however, does not go as intended. Caught and forced to stay in her house a week before her operation, Lena starts to lose all hope, until Alex comes to rescue her. They make their escape for the Wild, but it does not go as planned...<br /><br />\\"I run for I don't know how long. Hours, maybe, or days. Alex told me to run. So I run. You have to understand. I am no one special. I am just a single girl. I am five feet two inches tall and I am in-between in every way. But I have a secret... I love you. Remember. They cannot take it.\\"<br /><br />The combination of romance, action, drama, and mystery in the plot made Delirium very easy to fall in love with, which also made the ending very powerful and sad. If you get as attached to the characters as I did, you will have tears in your eyes when you finish. The cliffhanging ending will make you want to immediately read the second book of Oliver's trilogy, Pandemonium. Overall, Delirium was everything I was expecting and more. From the unexpected twists to the amazing characters and great story, you will not be disappointed. The intended audience is for young adults but can be enjoyed by all ages. I absolutely recommend picking up a copy immediately if you love dystopian stories or just, in general, love a great read.the preaching from the government.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Watch out!  This is a very addicting game, but it is very fun for all ages!  Good way to kill time, or waste time.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Loved it! good Cd and getting the live version too was a wonderful bonus! Bought it for 1 song and ended up liking the entire CD!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Awesome collection of stars! Seeing all these characters together makes for a great comic action movie. The story flows very well. There are only a few minor areas that don't work, but the intensity of the film and comedic moments make this a very entertaining action film.
B0011AQLZQ|3.0|I really liked these movies overall.  I signed up for something on Amazon and got a free video download and chose Harry Potter.  It could be because this movie is not HD, but the quality of this product did not even seem DVD quality.  In any case it looks terrible even on my 14-inch laptop screen that boasts 720p quality.  I subscribe to the Amazon Prime service and I've found the streaming gives very good quality video, so I was surprised at the grainy quality of this video available from their download service.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Fun movie. Even better than the first. Lots of action all over the place, lots of gadgets/technology. Better flow than the first one.
B00846REIS|4.0|Really great read. I'm a huge 50 Shades fan but this is right up there with it. Definitely recommend it!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent book and something a bit different. Following a man's fight for survival was compelling reading. A true page-turner. Highly recommended!
B000YHE4AG|4.0|The combination of Bob Newhart and Will Ferrell gives the movie comedic heft.  Zooey Deschanel's singing and her transformation from cynic to a person caught up in Will Ferrell's enthusiasm is fun to watch.  If you have a chance to see the live musical production it is worth the experience.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I discovered the Piano Guys on YouTube and immediately fell in love with their music. They put a unique modern twist on classical music. This album is no exception. Each song has a unique soul in it that makes you want to move with the music (at least that's how I feel) It is well worth the cost and more especially if piano/cello music is your thing. Even my brother who is a sworn opponent to any classical music says the piano guys are \\"not bad\\"
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this better than on a regular computer!  It worked the first time and is very quick.  I would recommend this game!
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a great way to kill time when waiting for an appointment or when your brain needs a break from work. It's fun, challenging and short!
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations.  It actually had a very good story line in addition to some really nice looking men!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does what it's supposed to do! sure comes in handy especially sinse I gave up my smart phone to cut back expenses. This does the job great!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is so wonderful. I play it around the house daily. My kids love it. My friends love it. The Piano Guys are amazing!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love Susan Boyal. this album is very subdued, beautiful, soft music. It isn't a new spin on her style but I love it just the same.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great speedy delivery and product was in perfect condition. I am a big fan of the series and I am glad to get it at a great price.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|It was a good sequil to the first Hangover, but not quite as funny, as it follows the same theme as the first one.  Still worth getting.
B005KMX866|5.0|Chris Isaak is new to me.  He really signs these Sun song great.  I am amazed how much he sounds like the original artists.
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver's The Signal And The Noise is a useful introduction to key issues in forecasting.  Its primary benefit is in introducing a healthy dose of skepticism into our understanding of forecasts, which as he points out are often misinterpreted - even by experts in the field.  It does, however, have a few flaws that keep it from reaching its greatest potential.<br /><br />The book is clearly organized between a first half, which focuses primarily on problems with forecasts, and the second, which purport to provide suggestions for improving them.  In practice, the distinction becomes a bit muddled, as Silver hesitates to provide many definitive statements or proscriptions.  But the structure generally functions well.  Silver does a good job of leading the reader through a number of fields such as weather forecasting and earthquake prediction while pointing out the underlying issues that prevent such estimates from being more accurate.  Perhaps his most important points relate to those that make the reader a better consumer of forecasts: the need for a strong theoretical foundations for statistical models and the numerous surprising ways they can go wrong.<br /><br />That said, there are two issues I have with the book.  First, it forces several overlapping but distinct topics into a single volume.  Silver is a Bayesian forecasting evangelist, and he references the benefits of this approach repeatedly.  But despite a good basic overview of this concept he lacks the space to provide much information on the alternatives or to do his argument justice.  I would have preferred that Silver have left this topic for a more complete technical discussion, likely in another book or essay.  Similarly, the sheer number of examples means that we often jump from topic to topic without a common thread to pull us along, providing the appearance of a series of essays rather than a single argument.<br /><br />Second, Silver appears to overextend his argument in the latter half of thebook.  He often points out that \\"unknown unknowns\\" - variables unknown to the forecaster - complicate models and lead to surprising and inaccurate predictions.  However, he sometimes pushes this point too far into the realm of political economy and thus draws conclusions that appear accurate but often provide little guidance as to how to manage such forecasts or whether unknown unknowns might be incorporated into Bayesian analysis ex ante.  As just one example, he critiques anti-terror intelligence communities as failing to perceive 9-11 despite an analysis suggesting that a large-scale terrorist attack, like a surprisingly large earthquake, might be plausible.  Yet he is unable to articulate how analysts might have incorporated relevant unknowns into their models before the fact, as well as how they might plausibly prevent it using statistical analysis (knowing an attack is a low-probability possibility is very different from understanding that an attack may occur in a specific place at a specific time using a specific methodology).  Silver acknowledges these facts but does articulate how they undercut his prior critique.<br /><br />Overall, The Signal And The Noise is a strong book and a good read for anyone who must act as a reader or judge of statistical forecasts.  It will not replace technical discussions of statistics but is an accessible and readable jumping-off point.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I have been a Star Trek fan forever and this remastered set is a must add to the library of any Star Trek fan. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is due to the quality of the cheesy plastic sleeves that hold the DVDs which are flimsy and can break easy which is a stark difference from the attractive and space-aware outer cases.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Seriously! the worst. all Disney and Pixar do anymore is slop together junk and make a ton of money off of us lemmings.<br />at least I didnt waste too much money or gas.<br />thank god for streaming. Even my daughter thought it was lame.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to  be. I was very happy to have watched this movie.  Even happier that Amazon gives you 48 hours to enjoy this rental, unlike itunes.  I am going to watch it again now.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|One of those movies fun enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.  My 10 year old completely enjoyed it.
B009SQRL4U|2.0|Seemed like a no brainer that my house would love this movie, but halfway throuh both my kids (ages 4 and 8) went to play something else with daddy and I fell asleep. Not what we thought it would be at all
0449014509|5.0|My son and I listened to this book together, on CD.  We both agreed that this was the best book of the Heroes series.  The reader was very good, also.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter and I have been waiting since the day we heard it was coming out (a long time to wait!) and I couldn't be happier with the result! we love the Tinkerbell Character being portrayed as a tomboy and I love having her as an animated roll model for my little girl. Two thumbs WAY UP!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|i would tell anyone, this is one of the best movies for family & dog lovers since (old yeller}!  .
B00005JKHP|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephew.  However, I have seen the movie before, and I like it.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|This has to be one of Scott's best films in a long time.  The problems with the plot people had I understand and I did too but when I saw it a second time, it made a lot more sense.  It all hinges on the robot character ... if you watch the movie again, watch him carefully ... and what I thought was interesting, and I'm sure the screenwriters and Scott were aware of this, but we the audience, like the human characters in the film, are so used to automatically excepting anything a machine tells us, without ever considering that perhaps it is either wrong or is trying to - in the case of the movie where machines have developed to this high level of intelligence - manipulate us ...
B004FOA84A|1.0|I bought this one thinking it was  going to be as great as The lost City. It did not even come close. I would not waste my money on it. I did not look at the reviews. I will next time. Never ASSUME anything. I have played the lost city 3 times, thats how much fun it was. This Grisly is just that, Grisly.<br />TJ Harmon
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works and doesn't wiggle in the slot.<br />The one that came with the kindle was wonky.<br />I'm happy with it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Keeps your attention the ENTIRE time! This author is amazing! It's like watching TV how she describes things, without being boring on the descriptions.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It has cool games on it and really easy to get coins!! A great vaule for a free app to play:)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thought that Grishsman had returned to the excellent themes he had in the past.  A much better read than his recent books.  Back to the expected level of such a prolific writer.  Excellent
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I did not know what to expect when i viewed the film. It was entertaining and enjoyable. The acting  was alright. Not academy award material, but enjoyable. The story line about killing young kids by bigger and older kids, was hard to swallow, but there were no gruesome scenes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of his best.  Mitch Rapp returns to top status.  A great and quick read that is totally engrossing and could not put it down
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The movie was better than i expected. The story line is believable and the cenemontoghery is very good. I would recommend this film to everyone.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys made it again.<br /><br />Listening to their music is always a joy. Their quality is exceptional and the music choices are fantastic.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I love all the Disney/Pixar movies, and this was no exception. Funny, exciting, some drama, but thoroughly entertaining for everyone.
B002RI9UKE|5.0|this is a great book.. once i started reading it i didnt stop until i finished it... congrats to the writer
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|This was a good movie, not great. Very entertaining and the ending was awesome. Christian Bal has been a great Batman, and Tom Hardy was phenomenal as Bane.
B0076DELIG|5.0|M. Connelly has never disappointed. I have read most of his work. Black Box is riveting until the last word. Once again, I now must wait for his next novel...they are like dessert..over too soon!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is one of the best games in the world I think eyery one should get this app minecraft.
B008ADUHKW|5.0|Alice Munro's short stories are getting better and better. The characters are complex and the endings are compelling and surprising. The theme is not so much love and life as attachment. The characters attach to each other in many unusual, intriguing, depthful ways. Some people are not able to connect and be intimate at all. There are very old lovers and platonic relationships. The stories at the end are based on Munro's life and I found them fascinating as well. They are not as sharp and vivid as the other short stories, but I felt privileged to know about Munro herself. I found myself savouring and reflecting on the stories most evenings. It's a wonderful read.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 8-yr-old grandson and I have been watching this on TV during the Christmas season for years. I finally decided to get it on DVD so we can enjoy it commercial-free. Love the movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My all time favorite music. This stuff gives me chills. I have it in my car and even my daughter asks for it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My family is a huge fan of The Piano Guys.  I bought the album for my 8 yr old for Christmas (at his request.)  This album is amazing.  These men are so incredibily talanted; their music is fun, catchy, and uplifting at the same time.  I'm excited to see what they come out with next!
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I love Three Days Grace and this CD did not disappoint me.  I liked every song on it and that is very unusual.  Great!
B008602KQI|5.0|My review for this book is the same for the other one. I enjoy what i have read up to this point
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm so glad I read this book because it gives everything a proper ending.  And I liked the ending.  Very cool.  Good job.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have not had much time to read it, but so far find it to be good. Glad i bought it
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The Twilight series is one of those series you can read over and over again.  At least I can.  I re-read Breaking Dawn again just before I went to see the movie even though I knew it wouldn't be quite like the movie.  Great book.  Love the ending.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I loved this! The blend of music is just perfect to my music collection when I need to wind down and just relax. The music makes my heart smile and isn't that what all music should do?
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What a classic! Love this around Christmas time. We had this on VHS but I wanted it on DVD. So we got this one and it came fast and as descibed. Brand new in plastic.
0345803493|5.0|i enjoyed the whole fifty shades trilogy! it's a great love story as well as a sexy novel you must read!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If it is a step by step guide that you are seeking, to build a book for Kindle - this book takes some beating. Everything you need to get you ready and published on Amazon. Within one month of reading this book, I uploaded my first kindle book. I now have two more ready for upload and three on their way. How is this for results?<br /><br />I totally 100% recommend Building Your Book for Kindle by Amazon/Kindle.
0345803507|5.0|i enjoyed the whole fifty shades trilogy! it's a great love story as well as a sexy novel you must read!
0762777931|5.0|How many people can say that the &#34;Diet&#34; books they have read are both Informative and Interesting. Well, I can now.<br /><br />Crazy Sexy Diet is not about dieting. Rather it seeks to inform humanity about the benefits of educating oneself about various sources of foods and how to utilize them for the benefit of our wellbeing and the way we feel.<br /><br />I recommend Crazy Sexy diet to everyone - especially girls in their late teens and early twenties. The information contained herein is what we all need to know as young women BUT often don't find out until we experience a health scare or worse.<br /><br />Check out the Author's cookbook &#34;Crazy Sexy Kitchen&#34; I bought both and LOVE Kris Carr's fresh approach to food and wellbeing.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to become informed about how to get the most out of your body, mind and soul. I invite you to purchase these books today. You will be thrilled that you did. Just like I was.
B003Y5H574|5.0|i love romantic comedies and this one definitely hits the nail on the head! funny, soft, and just all around great!~
B000YDG5W0|2.0|This product looked stylish, and they were made of recyclable materials, which is also a plus. I ordered them for my boyfriend, knowing how much he wanted this pair after doing a lot of research/comparisons. When I got them, they were such low quality, not at all what I expected when ordering from Timberland. First of all, both boots were scratched during the shipping, which I thought was strange, given all the padding. But, oh, it scratched with even the most delicate touch of my nail. How could this been good for the outside?! Then, when I had my boyfriend try them on, they did the loud squeaking of shoes that are manufactured too stiffly. He wore them inside for the next few days to maybe \\"break them in,\\" but they never stopped that awful squeaking. For the money I paid, and the reputation of Timberlands, I expected a better product. We decided to return them and find a more durable boot for the Michigan winter.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|The best make-up book I've ever purchased.  I've have purchased several other books over the years but this is my favorite.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't like sci-fi but was desperate for something to read on a long flight. Hubby had bought this book and suggested it so I gave it a try.  Couldn't put it down!  What an amazing idea Hugh has spun into a world. Fascinating. Now I am on here to buy more!  Great story, great writing, great adventure.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I started reading Sharp Objects early one Sunday morning. . . and I did not quit reading until I finished it about 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. I had previously read Girl Gone, which I will admit is a much more developed novel, with an unusual technique. But I found for a first novel, this was excellent and a real page-turner.
B0035RFYT2|3.0|Figurine was a lot smaller than I expected.  My grandson picked it out on his wish list, so I just hope he will be happy with it.
B007PPE086|5.0|she plays with it everyday and she let her friends play with it too then she put it next to her
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I have always been a Bee Gees fan and these cds have all my favorite songs on them.  Would definitely buy this again!!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|she  watch it  everyday and every night then she it every night she just loves to she loves the<br />thank you
B000001EYW|5.0|This cd is really good.  Has a lot of really good songs on it.  I am a big Bee Gees fan!
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the storyline. I love the theme. I just love the entire movie in itself.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm going to need one after playing this to level 10 in one night. This is the original coin dozer so be sure to download it!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Il Divo are just too too wonderful their voices blend beautifully.  Such talent .  Cannot wait till next cd comes out .  When will that be?
B000000XBC|5.0|The order came two weeks earlier than stated and with no damage to the order.  I look forward to ordering from The MusicShop again, I'm very satisfied with service.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait. I love history and British Series. The characters are warm and realistic.This is as good as it gets.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|A graduate thesis seminar!  I read it on the recommendation of others. It was a struggle for me to finish it. Turgid
B0052UZIFA|5.0|An all thime favorite Game.<br />Dancing zombies Rock!<br />Crack that code if you havent.<br />this game is enjoyable. and i love the<br />music video in credits.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Although I have the 10th Anniversary concert from Royal Albert Hall, I watched this one on PBS recently, and fell totally in love with it as well.  It was so interesting to see some familiar faces in other roles.  The music is still wonderful, the words still stir me to tears.  As soon as it was over, I knew I had to have it in my library.  It was also great seeing people from the original 1985 cast at the end.  Colm Wilkinson can still hit and hold that high note at the end of Bring Him Home.  It gives me goosebumps every time.  This is well-worth the money.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|at it's best.  Heard this album, well a cut from it, and sought it out, then after getting this got all their albums.  After you hear this you'll be amazed at how many places on TV [commercial, shows] that use these guys.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Randy Couture is an awesome fighter and even a good sports anouncer, but acting is definitely not his thing. He ruined the first movie for me. Everyone in the movie has a type of character that they act out. Randy doesn't at all because he can't act. This movie he definitely has fewer lines, but he still sucks. lol.<br />Aside from that, it was a pretty cool story and had some good action scenes. But seriously, one really bad actor ruins a movie for me.
1451627289|5.0|I'm not a big Stephen King fan, but really loved this book.  I was 10 years old when President Kennedy was assassinated, so I remember those times.  King did a great job of describing the feel of the time.  I also loved how he alluded to some of his other books.  The story itself was totally engaging as well.  I had a hard time putting it down.  A really good read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It helps if you see the Youtube movies first, to get the amazing imagery stuck in your head. The Piano Guys musical style is unique and transcendent, to be sure, but the addition of visual beauty make the songs meaningful--like an outstanding movie score.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I got to the third section,  despite many glitches along the way. I got to the road where the fallen tree blocks the way,  and you use the axe to clear it. I did that,  and the road is cleared,  BUT NOW THERE IS A SQUARE WITH A PICTURE OF A BRANCH AND THE AXE THAT STAYS ON THE SCREEN.  It 's on EVERY SCREEN. I cannot do puzzles since it is blocking the view. TALK ABOUT A MAJOR MALFUNCTION!  If I cannot get it to disappear,  then I would have to uninstall and reinstall. If that 's the case,  I won 't reinstall. Just let it go until they can fix the problems with an update. WAIT ON GETTING THIS ONE UNTIL IT WORKS! UPDATE: The axe issue was fixed, but the wood pile needed for the moonshine was not there.  So, reluctantly I uninstalled and reinstalled, and it is working fine! EXCELLENT GAME! Love this type! I have upgraded it to 5 stars!
0671027344|5.0|This is probably one of my most favorite books. The movie is great too, but the book just has an incredible message.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Not as full funny as I thought it would be...some parts made me laugh but most didn't...disappointed...really liked the others.
B008KWHM6U|5.0|This album is great! There's not a bad song on it, and they all fit together beautifully. Best song: Ocean
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I first watched this with my granddaughter when she was just 2 1/2--I purchased it on VHS.  We watched it over and over again. She's 16 now and I bought it for her in DVD for Christmas.  As a matter of fact I bought 3--I plan on giving one to a friend for her grandson and one for me to keep.  I watched it by myself when it arrived and was still enchanted by the magical snowman and the Christmas eve journey.  I think my granddaughter will be surprised to see it again after all this time.  I recommend this for anyone from 1 to adult if you believe in magic and wonder.  It's only about 30 minutes long --- so it's good for a young child.
B000007492|5.0|Came on time. Would buy again from this vendor, product came as advertised have used this item worked fine beings back lots of memories
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I've never doubted that there is life after death.  My mother had an experience long before it was written about and quite frankly was frightened by the fact that the medical staff was saying that she had died and she saw them working on her body.  She kept telling them that she wasn't dead, but couldn't make them hear her.<br />My dad had a long conversation with his deceased mother the day before he died.<br />This book, however, being written by a previous non-believer, may make others take note and explore just how much our Savior loves each and everyone of us.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Star Trek Voyager is is one of the best Trek Series. Storylines for the most aprt are easy to follow and mostly well thought through. Star Trek Voyager
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I don't know why I've never been a Rod fan before but this Christams album has changed my mind.  It's really good and like his duets with the other artists on it also.
B008BO61BE|5.0|This type of metal , melodic metal is the finest most well sung and created type of metal in existance. Most critics agree that this was jp's finest hour. I love all their music though, and even enjoy the early seventies more hard rock priest. I already had the first remaster of this one , but this was worth the upgrade, it has four more songs and a whole dvd of the u.s. festival show from 1982. Priest did everyting right here, they should have never tried to do speed metal , which is a inferior brand of metal. (see painkiller) but even that was superior to most bands in  that genre. This one though is filled with classic tracks from the band: 'screaming for vengeance', 'electric eye', and many others. This one had not a weak song on it and it is one of the finest examples of harder melodic metal ever made. GEt the newest version. Frankly if record companies had brains they would have released lots of packages like this back in the 80's. Why wait 30 years? ten years was long enough , and now many of the people who first bought this are middle aged. Young people though should be happy to grab this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Can't stop playing and should be sleeping. Games like this are so much FUN! It will be a while before I burn out on this.
B005VXK5RY|2.0|Liked Volume I better.  Was expecting more of the same.  This Volume is totally different.  More like rockabilly instead rock and roll.  Must have been some of their earlier stuff.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I really enjoyed this game it is a different take on most bubble pop type apps. You win tools hidden in some bubbles and other types of bubbles such as stoned will help you in your challenge. I like the variety colors and the difference of play from most games of this type.<br />Overall I would recommend it and kids will enjoy it too.<br />Florida Mom
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Good.  Plenty of twists and turns to keep you watching.  The actors were great.  Worth watching again.  And I don't watch many movies twice.
0984380213|5.0|Great book with VERY realistic scenario for planning and keeping accountability. I bought my partner one and he thought the same!
B005USZYDU|5.0|A slightly different Grisham but an enjoyable read.  I noticed there are more  Theodore Boone  novels.  I'll read them too.
B001F0N0ZG|3.0|I have viewed this storyline  many times so I almost know it by heart.what surprised me was the editing which left out many important events;some of my favorites.I felt drained after viewing this because it was unsatisfying as it usually is to me.If the show had been shown in its entirety,it would have been great but the poor editing and deletions left me feeling cheated.Now I have to purchase the reat thing.
B00846REIS|1.0|I was curious about this book, now  Ifound  it the most boring book I have read for a long time. How many times does this main character need sex. The whole book is about how hard up she is for this man, even when they separate at different times, there is always, the touch, the feeling, the orgasm, and even more. I thought I had to finish it for the next order from kindle. Of course if you are a sexaholic,you will love it. I think it was actually a satire about sex and sexual pleasure. Skip everything else and just read the sex scenes. It is all the same
0783240287|5.0|My daughter was auditioning for this show and it was perfect addition to our musicals collection.  Auditions are over and she was a shu in.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas and when I opened the package I was so happy with what I saw.  Very adorable and cute and great quality.  Will make the perfect stocking stuffer.<br /><br />A perfect gift for a little girl, she will love it!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It was a great book. I never saw the end coming... Total surprise. Not too long; I have a short attention span and this was a good length.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|This mouse is perfect for me. I wish it was available in a cordless edition, but it's lighter this way so it's a trade off. With a traditional mouse, I can only last a couple of hours before my hand becomes too weak to even hold the mouse. This mouse immediately solved all of my problems and works beautifully.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Very talented, very entertaining.  Making music is obviously their passion.  It is great to see such talented musicians who enjoy what they are creating.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I loved watching this group of talented musicians on the Sing Off and was not disappointed when they came out with this christmas album. I rate it five stars even though I wish it had more music on it.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This movie isn't work watching. Although I love to look at gorgeous men and I'm a huge fan of Matt Bomer, this film was awful! There was barely any storyline and the way the movie was written they made it sound like all male dancers are drug addicts who sleep around a lot and use bad langauage. I personally know a male dancer and he's a sweet wonderful man and nothing like the guys in this movie. I hated all the drugs and bad langauage. I was hoping this movie had some romance in it but it was nothing about hot young sexy guys romancing. It was about hot young guys getting high on drugs, thinking they are the world's gift because they are young and hot and about them sleeping around a lot and I don't mean in a romantic way. I mean in a sleezy way.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The story never slowed like season 2. Great continued character development and plenty of action and suspense to keep you glued to the screen.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the sequel to Bared to You. It's actually a far better book than Bared to You because it has much more of a storyline besides the characters just having constant sex and arguing. However, it's not anything like Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. This book is not about BDSM or a D/s relationship. It's about two abuse surviors who have serious emotional/mental baggage and inspite of that, they manage to stay together and love each other deeply. In the first book, Bared to You, I was not feeling the &#34;I can't live without you&#34; love connection between Eva and Gideon. But in this book, Reflected in You, it became much more evident that they love each other so very deeply that they will do anything for each other. It's a great story and I'd definitely put it up there with Fifty Shades of Grey, but just be aware that if you're looking for a book series about BDSM or a D/s relationship Bared to You and Reflected in You are not what you are looking for. If you just want a great intense love story with a lot of erotic love scenes, then then Bared to You and Reflected in You will hit the spot perfectly.
B0083EM24C|5.0|Just listen to the album before you buy... I think it is worth it, but I liked Manners slightly better.
B00846REIS|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but...I got tired of all the arguing the main characters do in the book. Also, I had read many reviews that this book is similar to Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James, no it is not in my opinion. This book, although a great story they I enjoyed, didn't have the &#34;I can't put this book down&#34; quality that Fifty Shades has. Bared to You just doesn't have all the exciting things going on in it like Fifty Shades does. I also just didn't feel the &#34;I can't live without you&#34; love connection that I did with the characters in Fifty Shades. Originally I thought this book was going to be similar to Fifty Shades but Bared to You is not about BDSM or a D/s relationship. Instead it's about two people who are very physically into each other, who are emotionally damaged and drive each other crazy with their emotional insecurities and immature jealousies to the point that they spend an extreme amount of the waking hours arguing. Don't get me wrong...I did enjoy the book enough to finish it and continue to read the sequal, &#34;Reflected in You&#34;, which by the way, is a far better book than Bared to You as it gets more into a storyline.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|At first, I felt some pieces had been written clumsily, but the characters and story kept me attached and interested.  Part way through the book I started to appreciate how well she had knitted everything together.  It was well done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great love story. A little kinky but great. Anastasia is one lucky girl to have found Christian Grey and has fallen head over heels.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|i love it i love it i love it! i have been watching them  now for about 2-3 weeks now! every chance that i get i have been poppin' another one of the episodes in!! i have  2  or three left. i  am savoring the moments before i put those last few in!!! because i want to make sure that the mood is right and plus i figure out where i am gonna get season three from!! i have season one and season two!!! i love it i don't want to play the last few episodes because season three is ?????
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Amazing album with such an original and inspiring take on music and composition. From the instruments to the sound mixing to the videography, all of the Piano Guys define what it means to be artists in the truest sense of the word! There is one thing horribly wrong with this album though.....it ends.
B00138KEZ4|5.0|Best Christmas cd ever, love it! Great renditions of my fav holiday songs. I could listen to it all year long!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are truly amazing and their music is so uplifting. They put me in a good mood and lift me up when I am down.
B0030E5NLE|5.0|This record came in quickly after I ordered it and was in great shape. It was wrapped in bubble wrap to prevent damage as well as preserved in original packaging. It even came with an external online download link to the album which was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this to any Vinyl collector, or music fan in general. This was definitely a great buy!
B008OTTRXU|3.0|If you listen to the clips before buying, you know what you're getting.  Some songs are better than others, but was good price and overall happy with the purchase.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read. Well written  I didn't think this couple would ever get together.<br /><br />How did the groom get so rich?
B000ID37KO|4.0|The Birds was weird and a little scarey. The acting style was oddly fascinating, understated I guess. I really didn't like the ending, just seemed like they just called it quits.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|Really awesome Collectors Item. I LOVE SOUTH PARK...GREATEST TV SHOW IN MY BOOK.<br />Well to start, the box was sent undamaged.<br />The packaging cover is beautiful with Eric on a pile of money and Kenny with empty pockets.<br />From what I can see \\"Mohamed\\" is printed on the Monopoly Board (F-ing Funny). the corners have the original Monopoly pictures, but to me kinda sucks that its not something South Park. I gave it 5 stars because anything South Park is worthy of it.<br /><br />I cant really comment anymore because it is still unopened under the Xmas tree.<br />14 days to go till my SouthPark-Xmas.<br />After Xmas we all will be waiting for South Park: The Stick of Truth (Coming 2013/03) and the New Season to start.<br />Merry Xmas Everyone!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was the first book I read by Card. I really enjoyed it and have recommended it to all my kids and my siblings and to anyone else who is a fan of a great story. I can't wait to see the movie in March 2013!!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|What a great movie. Cant wait for part 2.<br />I am a great fan of Frank Miller's Batman series and have been hoping that someday someone will make them into movies.<br />This is one every collector should own especially on bluray because there are more Special Features than the one on DVD.<br /><br />Worth having on Bluray and in your collection!!!

It is not a single miracle on a single morning but the miracle of transforming EVERY morning that will change your life for the better.  Hal's no nonsense approach is easy to follow and works on the FIRST day.<br /><br />I could write a review a mile long, but as my title states,<br />\\"What are YOU waiting for...?\\"<br />Get the book NOW and have a Miracle Morning TOMORROW!<br /><br />I did  :-)

B008XX6J4C|5.0|From my three year old to my hard to please mom everyone likes to listen to this music even if they don't know the original songs they base them on.  I've listened to and played John Schmidt's music for years.  It's great to have pop music from classical instruments and get everyone excited about it.

B006IYFCIM|4.0|Currently, I am a student at Carlow University and I am working towards a Master of Science degree in the Fraud and Forensics program (MFF).  Dan Ariely's book: \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\\" was a required text we had to read during one of our courses.  A link to Carlow University's graduate program is listed below:<br />[...]<br />Overall, I like that Ariely's book is told as a story (some personal) rather than textbook theory.  It is an easy, interesting read testing different hypotheses.  Joining Carlow University's MFF program has broaden my insights, I now question whether statements have scientific evidence to back up theory.  Ariely conducts multiple experiments to test theories; one major finding he uncovered was that instead of a small amount of people lying a lot, it seems that everybody lies a little bit, and just enough to maintain a positive self-image.  The thing I like about this book is that he makes his experiments interesting.  One experiment Ariely conducted was to see whether or not people who wore knock-off designer items were more prone to cheating.  I will not give the answer away but his results lead to the \\"What-the Hell\\" effect which is built on the perception that if you cheat on one thing, it will cause you to abandon your efforts all together.  For example, does cheating on a diet make people throw in the towel altogether?<br /><br />Below is a link to a recorded seminar Ariely had done to give an example of one of his experiments about testing lies. \\"Our Buggy Moral Code\\" is a good introduction to some of the research Ariely has conducted.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The thing that I did not like about Ariely's book is the population he used to conduct studies.  For example, since the designer items he used were woman sunglasses, he used all women to conduct the survey.  From what we have learned in the MFF program this could make the experiment bias and the results may not be as accurate as what they are portrayed.<br /><br />As for my future and what I would take from this book/course in the real world is a quote from Ariely himself, \\"We are going to take things from each other if we have a chance...many people need controls around them for them to do the right thing\\" (p. 5).  This statement verifies the need for education in white-collar crime in order to set up prevention and detection controls, along with Certified Fraud Examiners to investigate white-collar crime that happens in company's.  Ariely's research, along with other scholars, verifies that people will steal, skim, or launder money when the opportunities arise. Overall, Ariely's research is interesting and even if not required for a class it is a good read on behavioral analysis.<br /><br />-Mandy McKnightom this book/course in the real world is a quote from Ariely himself, \\"We are going to take things from each other if we have a chance...many people need controls around them for them to do the right thing\\" (p. 5).

B007THA4FI|2.0|I have not quite finished the book & can't decide where it is going. I must say that JK has a good idea of the seedier side of life & the people who live it. To be fair she does have a great deal of insight into the minds of her characters.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Being a list freak, i tried several notepad apps for the Kindle Fire.  I found most to be either too limited or buggy/slow.  This is by far the best.  Has all the good featured, and runs like a champ.  Love the way it is integrated with Skitch.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Love all Kelly Clarkson's songs. My favorite<br />song is this album has to be the &#34;Dark Side&#34;<br />Also Don't be a girl about it!!! Laughed the first time I heard this song!
B001NXDIMK|4.0|Season 2 is almost as addictive as Season 1 of Damages. However, William Hurt is terrible, godawful. He mumbles & broods, is mannered, and has some weird accent--like he's been imprisoned in Russia for 20 years. Everything he does screams: \\"I'm Acting\\". He was so great in \\"Body Heat\\", but there seems to be some BH curse (look at Mickey Rourke & Kathleen Turner). Only Ted Danson escaped that movie to become better. Unfortunately, he is in the background of Season 2. Glenn Close is still ruthless & dominates every scene she's in. Rose Byrne is okay. But when she walks around with her serious \\"I'm a bad-ass\\" face, it's almost laughable. The most annoying character is Patty Hewes' son. He was a serious misfit in the first season, now, after a few weeks of strict boot-camp, he's the perfect preppie son. Not sure what the point of him is. To humanize Patty? Nothing could humanize that frightening woman. Despite these complaints, it's one of the best cable series out there (w/ Breaking Bad, Deadwood, 6 Ft Under).<br /><br />I deduct one star because as evil as Patty is, we still should be rooting for her to win. When we discover she hired hitmen to kill an associate out of paranoia, then nothing separates her from the Kendricks, Frobishers, &  corrupt cops she goes after--who do the exact same things. A series where everyone is evil, vain, corrupt & paranoid. And yet the damn thing is thoroughly addictive.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|THis is a one Album that is a must have if you are a Broadway fanatic!<br />Love the show. Saw it twicw. Once on tour and once in NYC!<br />My two fav. songs are popular!!

I also listen to it when I want to relax, or smile, or feel uplifted, or just bask in the glory of true talent. I love these guys!

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Every performance is &#34;spot on&#34; in this coming of age movie. I highly recommend this movie to the mature teenager on up. Many moments are heart warming AND downright hilarious. It will be a treasure in my library for years to come. Note that this movie is NOT for those without a quirky sense of humor!
6305428042|5.0|This is a great fun movie for older children and a good movie to watch with the family.  I think some parts could be a bit scary for little children but older children I think would really like it.  A really good Holloween move to watch as a fmaily.
0316228532|4.0|\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" follows a rather large number of characters and the relationships between them, against the background of a local election for a position vacated by a sudden death.<br /><br />My first idea when trying to describe the book was \\"it's a poor people's version of Middlemarch\\". And I mean that as a compliment, obviously, since being anywhere near the same league as Middlemarch is a great achievement for any work of fiction. Rowling is more clumsy and less subtle than Eliot -and her prose is not as beautiful-, but what they have in common -besides the use of microorganisms seen in a droplet under a microscope as a metaphor for an isolated, complicated society (ha! I totally spotted that)- is their throughout commitment to the coherence of the inner lives of the characters, and the main point: a vindication of uncelebrated lives.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy seems in the beginning somewhat awkward and stiff, the characters don't appear to be properly fleshed out and the reader worries that the moral of the story will be hamfisted. But it gets better as it progresses, especially as the teenage characters become more central to the story. They are very well written, they come to life effortlessly, and the author uses their relationships with mature characters as the main means of giving nuance and complexity to the latter.<br /><br />By the time the ending comes around, you are already deeply invested in the characters and you hope that the interlacing of their destinies would culminate with something great and good and restorative. But as some characters get their hope back, or gain some more control over their lives, others have everything taken from them or learn how misguided their projects were. The book doesn't end with some great hopeful statement -as one might expect given my comparing it to Middlemarch-. We get an illustration of how the under-priviledged, unloved, shunned and despised character left a mark on the lives of others, but the narrator doesn't take over to comfort us with a quotable ending line. Nevertheless, it feels right.<br /><br />All in all, The Casual Vacancy is a good book -at times even very good- and I can't wait for more.
0743201140|5.0|Shipping was super fast and this is a great book for anyone looking to find out their strengths and not focus on weaknesses like everyone always does
B00A23MYCC|4.0|I bought this! Not rented. Actually bought...but not the unrated. I figured the R would be enough. It was. But all those years I told my kids they should not waste their time on Family Guy and to now learn that Seth MacFarlane is a genius. Kids, i was wrong. Sorry.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I also brought this as a gift for a friend she loves this show all she talks about she has been wanting this for a long time and im glad i could make her happy by finding this on amazon
B0090EHVMC|1.0|Once again, Hollywood tries to interject politics into a kids movie.  The Lorax was boring and over-politicized.  Don't waste your time or money.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|For a BB's fan since 1964, you are grateful for at least having the opportunity to buy a concert in Blu Ray (not movies, history, etc), a CONCERT. True, it's only half a concert, but...better than nothing.<br />Really hope that the producer hear what the fans are asking for, the full concert. I don't care if they name it \\"part 2\\" or \\"parts 1 and 2\\". I will buy it!!!!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love Firefly and bought this one day on a whim. I'm glad I did. This is a great series and I'm glad to now own it.
B009DJB9HC|2.0|I've bought all three BCC studio albums and this one is their weakest effort by far. I'll be the first to admit I'm a HUGE fan of Bonamassa and I know Derek and Jason are both very talented. That brings me to Glenn Hughes. Whether you love him or loathe him (there appears to be no middle ground amongst BCC fans) the guy can still bring it, vocally. His voice is still unbelievably strong for someone who's now 61 and lived the life he's lived. Unfortunately, at my age (52), it's like nails on a chalkboard to me. I literally cringe when I hear GH sing/scream. It seems like he's constantly trying to show off how good he still is. I get the same impression when I see singers on American Idol. (\\"Look at me! Look at me!)<br /><br />I still think BCC 2 is by far their best album. GH is more subdued and Joe and Derek have more of a presence on BCC 2. I also agree with an earlier reviewer and think Joe should take some time off. I love the guy but I'm beginning to wonder how much gas (i.e quality, original material) he has left in the tank. Driving Towards The Daylight was easily his weakest album to date.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Great movie, would recommend to anyone!! It was a favorite of mine from childhood and I was happy to find out it was as great as I remembered.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I am obsessed with Criminal Minds. Am I warped? haha. Seriously, this show is amazing. I have only had nightmares once or twice from the really creepy stories. I just keep coming back for more. It is always interesting and captivating, and, well, the men are nice to look at, too. Each character is so different, and the respect they have for each other is inspiring. I like to think there is a real cast of them in many places in the world doing what they do and fighting the bad guys with as much determination as these guys. I hope this show continues for a long time.
034580404X|5.0|AWESOME AND AMAZING BOOK I LOVED IT. WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY ONE THAT LIKES VIVID MIND.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|i bet this game quickly but I really liked it. To my surprise, and unlike Fishdom by the same company, their was a unique picture puzzle at the end of each &#34;level&#34;. That kept my attention. The level of difficulty on that puzzle was to easy though. It was fun and interesting, but too easy.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this game.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Overall, I'm really pleased with this record and I have almost no criticism and the criticism I might have is constructive anyway.<br />I do see a lot of people offline and online saying a second album on such short notice wasn't really needed, but Up All Night was a 2011 record in the UK so it wasn't really a new release if you were a follower of the band on the X Factor. Typically, bands will release new records a year to two years apart at most, so I was not surprised with how quickly this record dropped.<br />Anyway, the boys said in an interview that they wanted the album to sound more like the live show with real drums and guitars and they really have accomplished that. I feel like they moved from pop straight into pop rock.<br />I'm also really glad that Louis has a lot of solos because he didn't have too much on the first record. Not only that, this album really shows off the entire bands true vocal talent, and that they have come a long way.<br />What I like about the album as a whole is that it is very nostalgic and it uses a language that really paints a picture in your mind for every song.<br /><br />As far as the track list goes:<br /><br />1. Live While We're Young<br />As far as sound goes, I feel like this is a graduated version of WMYB, but the message is completely different. Which is good, because I hate it when the first single on a bands second record directly relates to the first single from the first. After hearing the rest of the album, this is my least favorite, but it's still good.<br /><br />2. Kiss You<br />Easily the most infectious song on the album, in my opinion. This was the first one to get stuck in my head out of all of the tracks and it's been there since. There are so much dynamics in the vocals.<br /><br />3. Little Things<br />This song is the perfect pick me up. I think the goal of the song is kind of what WMYB was doing too, but this one runs a lot deeper. The cool thing about it, is that Ed Sheeran did write it, but One Direction made it totally their own. It doesn't sound like an Ed Sheeran parody, and that's a good thing. And although a ballad, it does fit in with the rest of the album.<br /><br />4. C'mon, C'mon<br />This one paints the best picture in my head out of all of them. I can literally see a couple in a venue falling in love, and it's a really romantic picture. It's not about hooking up at a club, it's about falling in love instead. I like songs that paint a picture like that.<br /><br />5. Last First Kiss<br />The high vocals in the chorus are executed wonderfully on this track, I think I noticed that above all else.<br /><br />6. Heart Attack<br />Another one that's easily relateable. To me, the second most infectious song on the album. Also, very vocally dynamic, much like Kiss You, but with a different message. It kind of has a 80's pop feel, but it still has that rock aspect which sets it apart from typical pop songs.<br /><br />7. Rock Me<br />This makes the change in genres for the band very apparent. It's ironic because the song is called Rock Me, and it's got more of a rock feel than anything on the album. I'm pretty sure this was done on purpose, and it works in the songs favor. This one I think has a very nostalgic feel. The guitar in the chorus is awesome, especially with the harmonies on \\"hit the pedal, heavy metal.\\" It flows so well together.<br /><br />8. Change My Mind<br />What I like about this one is how emotional it is, which is executed wonderfully in the vocals. I can really feel this song when I listen to it.<br /><br />9. I Would<br />Another song written by a group and made into something One Direction-esque. I would not have figured out that McFly penned this one, had Tom Fletcher not said something on twitter. I guess it was kind of obvious in comparison to McFly's `Obviously' because it's kind of similar lyrically, but hardly.<br /><br />10. Over Again<br />This one does sound like an Ed Sheeran cover which worries me a little bit. It's hard totell whether or not 1D or Ed would have executed it better, or maybe it'd be kind of even just because they did do a good job on this track.<br /><br />11. Back For You<br />For me, lyrically, this is a better version of Big Time Rush's \\"Worldwide\\".<br /><br />12. They Don't Know About Us<br />The melody to this song is always the first to get stuck in my head after I listen to it entirely.<br /><br />13. Summer Love<br />Very different from the rest of the album, but it somehow fits in. I think this is the song that sets this album apart the most from the last. I feel like with this one, One Direction really proved themselves.<br /><br />As far as bonus tracks go, I love how they all fit in with the bands new sound. A lot of time with bsides, they're trying to hard to be like the old record, but these ones stay consistent. This is good because their new sound is much more well developed.<br /><br />14. She's Not Afraid<br />Another one that paints a vivid picture, a little better than C'mon, C'mon. The chorus is very catchy.<br /><br />15. Loved You First<br />Once again, the flow of the chorus is what makes this song. I love the way the chords go behind the vocals.<br /><br />16. Nobody Compares<br />Usually songs with really long chorus's are boring, but that is not the case here. I especially love the guitar on the verses.<br /><br />17. This one sounds like a cross between something you'd hear on UAN and Take Me Home. I like the verses much more than the chorus, but overall, it's a good song. Definitely a melody that will get stuck in your head.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Challenging but fun! I love to customize my tanks and the game play is challenging enough to keep me engaged.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this game.
B009VB97EY|3.0|This movie is ok if you have nothing else to do. But it  doesn't have much of a plot and the acting is just so..so.  Decided to watch it because of the hype.  Shouldn't have wasted my time.
B009FXIICK|5.0|This is an exact duplicate of Zookeeper for DS game play style, which is just as it should be. I believe, if I go back into my memory banks, that the DS version had a story mode or something like that, but all I care about is the game play! and it's there!<br /><br />Everyone who complained about the graphics and blah blah... this is too classic to complain! Enjoy the game play and let it go!
8866131342|4.0|I love all things Moleskine.  This was the first time I've purchased this style of planner and am really pleased with the purchase.  It's small enough to throw in my purse or laptop bag and it's not bulky.  Enough space for my daily events as well as a notes page on the right side.  Would highly recommend.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a well written and thought provoking read about the walk through life. Made me wonder if we all shouldn't take a long walk and reflect on our own lives, come to terms with our demons and move on with peace and love.  Funny at times, sometimes ironic and like Chaucer's journey, the people Harold meets along the way are instrumental in his journey.
B008J34466|5.0|-my favorite CD this year, I loved it !<br />-well written lyrics, great melody<br />-each track feels truthful<br />-vocals are on point<br />-It's great to see how Pink continues to evolve as an artist....I can't understand why she doesn't receive half the accolades she deserves. She nevers cheats her fans by given half-as* performances or albums.<br />I strongly recommend this album especially for those who love good music<br />(Parents: if they have a clean version of this album get that copy instead)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book of the Crossfire series, was great!  Getting to learn more about Gideon's past and how deeply he loves and cares for Eva was wonderful.  The intensity between Eva and Gideon is beyond hot, and I can't wait for book 3!!!!
B003UBTX7C|3.0|This is by far the worst of the Camel Club series.  Club members involvement in this one is at a minimum and that sucks.  Another sucky issue is that the new head of intelligence is the same as the old one who was killed in the preceding book; just change the name, the character is the same.  And, low and behold, when you are in desperate need of a plot point or two, just have the boss either try to kill you or beat you up or whatever.  Just a total lack of imagination.  Then we supposedly have 6 hired Russians at Murder Mountain and low and behold, seven Russians are killed!  Count them.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Ke$ha is as usual, catchy, carefree, and just a little bit sleezy. Definitely a good buy if you like her other music. Nice music to drive to.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|giddy with excitement as I watch each episode.  The quality is great and there is so much stuff to watch.  The extras are great too.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It was everything I had hoped for. A sleek case along with all the great batmans. Everything looks and works great. Couldn't have asked for more.
B003UESJH4|5.0|You know, I was a child in Canada and had to listen to the King's speech every Christmas day before we got to open our gifts. I never knew he stuttered.<br /><br />The story  was so beautifully presented and I have watched it a number of times.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It cooled down my pc exactly like it was suppose to. Helped me OC to over 5.8 and stable. Highly recommended
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book was enjoyable to me from the standpoint that I grew up in Canada during those years of  WW2 and have friends from the UK who were sent out to the country to avoid any bomging of London.  We also have friends living in the Channel Islands who went through the war years there as kids, and have heard some of their stories and seen the Bomb shelters.<br /><br />The author wrote a creative narrative weaving truth and fiction and made a fun story to read.
1469984202|5.0|I don't know how much time Hugh Howey spent planning out this series, but while there are occasional logic gaps, there's nothing so obvious it pains the brain too badly*, just small things like -how are they repairing the grow lights?  The story is engrossing, the characters are interesting and distinct (love that!) and the world he creates now lives in my mind with the same legitimacy as middle earth and Spinner's End.<br /><br />After this five part book I quickly picked up the two prequels even though I was in a crappy cell phone location and using my Bionic phone as a reader.  I had to read them!  I can't wait till the last one comes out...<br /><br />*I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan, in fact my appreciation of anything fiction is limited to the solidity of the plot which is why I loved 'The Hunt for Red October' and couldn't stand 'Rainbow Six'.  My consciousness sniffs out gaps in logic and no matter how immersed I am in a story - there's a part of my mind that will suddenly interrupt with a \\"WAIT WAIT WAIT - how exactly would this PhD in science and technology NOT know that fuel and batteries have a limited shelf life!?!\\" which just KILLS my read. The created story can have magic and imagined technology as long as it's internally consistent** which requires the writer to think through their creation and do a little pre-planning prior to writing.
B001RNO7D0|5.0|Great shoes!  Very comfortable and long-wearing.  I use them as a replacement for everyday tennis shoes.  As they are a little warm in the summer, I also purchased the mesh version and both are still very comfortable.  If these ever wear out I will buy another pair.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is amazing. These two guys sounds great!  It's amazing how much fun these guys have while making creative beautiful music
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This was an alright movie, but as one other reviewer has pointed out, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. The injury subplot in the beginning seems crafted out of thin air just to have something that Bruce has to fight to overcome. The villains, too, seem much less alive and fleshed-out than previous installments, even if you disregard Ledger's performance of The Joker.<br /><br />There were a couple twists at the end that were good enough to draw my interest back, and it was entertaining, but not the exit I'd liked to have seen for this series.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Easily the best album I've heard released in 2012 and quite possibly in the last several years as well. This band has an incredible amount of potential!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|We watched with our 9 yr old. He enjoyed it - It opens up some further questions but a fun movie to get into the Christmas spirit,

B0052UZIFA|1.0|This needs to be upgraded to HD for android tablets. It looks horrible! Like 1980's TV horrible. Pixelated crap. My iPad looks 100 times better than my galaxy tab.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|I bought it to view streamed video on TV. Half of the reviews here were positive, so I gave it a shot. No luck. I got the sound, but the screen went blank and didn't register any signal.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Bought it for my phone and Kindle.  I like having the battery status info in the status bar.  You can customize what usage lifespan info appears with the battery icon.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|If you want to learn again how the human spirit perseveres in the face of adversity, read this book. Mr. Kamkwamba tells a story of triumph in the face of poverty and lack of resources without a trace of bitterness and with tender humor.
1582701709|5.0|This book will TRANSFORM everyone's life who allows themselves the privilege of reading it!!!  *GREAT THINGS AWAIT ANYONE WHO DOES!!*  :) :)
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Interesting graphics -- more like dusty balls than bubbles. The physics are pretty good when bouncing off side walls and such, but balls will occasionally pass through target balls to get to an empty space -- usually to my advantage but still minus a star. Nice strategy element introduced by having to drop special balls to gather their capabilities, e. g., chainsaw ball. No ability to swap next ball with the one on deck though, so minus another star as I find that really adds to play strategy. No idea how many levels are available as I've just downloaded and played a few. Overall, great FAOTD.
B000E1OI7G|1.0|I'm so disappointed to what i got from the dealer. The version i bought is a &#34;Criterion collection&#34; with 2 discs special edition. But what the dealer mailed me was not just a single disc edition. But it also the illegal version!!!! the dealer printed the cover by himself and it doesn't fit the box at all.<br />The disc inside the box wrote &#34;disc 2&#34;. obviously the &#34;Disc 1&#34; is disappeared!!!! (I can provide photos to prove it)<br /><br />And in the delivery description dealer wrote was from UK. but finally it was mailed from Mexico. It made me need to pay extra 16 Pounds for the VAT and handling fee costs!!!!<br /><br />I definitely request to refund including the VAT fee.<br /><br />What an irresponsible dealer!!!!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the piano guys and the music they create. Every song is beautifully composed. It is evident that they love what they do. It is a joy to listen to.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|This album was a surprise in many ways.  Of course, there is nothing like the sound of Crazy Horse belting out the electric distortion and that was a welcome sound for my ears.  Interestingly enough, Neil Young takes a variety of American folk songs and turns up the metal to bring them up to date.  What was really surprising was the lyrics to these songs; I've heard them over and over but never really listened to the words.  Some of these older songs tell quite a grisly tale of Americana; even some that seemed like children's songs.  So, get ready for a walk through American history, from the old to the new.  I found this work to be almost a political satire of American history, so check it out and see what you think.  Of  course, all intellectual babbling aside, it's good to hear Neil Young and Crazy Horse ROCK OUT!!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was a bit surprised because the box case was a bit shady like they were burned from someone's home. When I opened the box the same thing w/ all the DVDs. The pictures printed on the DVDs looked a bit pixelated. I am still giving it a 5 though because the DVDs work well and that is all that matters! Plus I am a big Daria fan!
1401937519|4.0|Our book club decided to read this, as many were fascinated with the near death experience and subsequent healing from stage 4 cancer that the author describes.  What I have found intriguing is the way the author captures the sights and scents of her amazing life in Hong Kong, India, and the time she was experiencing and out of body near death event.  For the curious and for those who just enjoy a good red, I would recommend this book.  Highly engaging with short chapters for those who like to finish one up before laying their head down on the pillow at night.
B0065FFMR0|2.0|After watching about four episodes, I skipped to the last few just to see the outcome, but it wasn't even a surprise. Just not my kind of thing, I guess, and I don't understand why it's rated so high by so many people. Three or maybe four stars (questionable), I could understand, but not five.
B009LY72LQ|5.0|I purchased this (and one additional set) as Christmas gifts for my almost 7 and 8 year old girls. The pricing is eight ninety nine, which is much cheaper than in store which I was shopping them at Target at I believe there it is twenty two. I have only just recieved these today, and can say that mine did come with two torsos, two heads two sets of arms and legs, it did however only come with one wig. I'm not too worried about only one wig especially with the pricing, and being \\"Monster High\\" dolls who says they all have to have hair anyway! Will try and update after they get some play time.
B007PFD90G|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Rushdie's writing since my late teens.  His memoir makes me appreciate so much more how he stood up for freedom of expression and of the written word.  This book in intensely personal at times, full of his usual humor, and brings to life the emotions and experiences he has chosen to share.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|My son is in the Navy so I had to watch this movie.  It was wonderful even though it was very sad!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After only reading the first book The Hunger Games it just wasn.t enough I had to have more of this Fasinating story ,so I ordered the trilogy book and enjoyed it from cover to cover...however dinner was served late on a few nights...Great read.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It's a great book on dissecting the ins and outs of cooking. I would have preferred more material on language dissection, but since this is a book on cooking, it's a good bonus!
B00881VLCE|4.0|This  Game is fun but hard if you are good at solving things than this is the right app for you!!!!
0811879542|5.0|This is the best book you could ever find<br />it's for kids but the guy's a genius, fun and smart, this is really the best book ever.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|AMAZING! The Piano Guys are innovative, creative and so talented! I love ALL of their songs and look forward to more to come!
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Heard Joe on PBS one night, listened to two albums worth of samples and bought'em. Some of the best blues-rock fusion I've ever listened to. How did I miss this guy...
0061438294|5.0|I found that this book is an amazing read. It was very interesting and captivating. I enjoy reading books like these.<br /><br />I don't really read body language, but I was very interested in the subject. I only knew a couple basic body language reads, but this book added a lot more to what I knew. Very good stories as well as pictures to help show the read as well as stories to show the body language displayed by others. There might or might not be more different body language reads, but this book does a good job telling you a lot of them.<br /><br />As I was reading this book, I was always thinking about events that happened where the body language was displayed by others as well as myself. This made it a lot easier to cement each body language into my memory.<br /><br />Even as I was watching television shows (not reality), a majority of the time, their body language was actually on cue with what they are portraying. But if you want to practice, definitely watch live television like the news or talk shows.
B005AC65TS|4.0|Heard John on PBS one night with Joe Bonamassa, and just had to check him out. How did I miss this guy...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really enjoyed the cd and I listened to it on my way down from college. I wish there were more cds because every single song is unique and gives you a different feel of music. The Piano Guys can very well integrate classical with \\"popular\\" or modern day techniques to help everyone enjoy a diverse amount of music.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like that there are no ordinary pony's there.  They are all different.  I like the cutie marks.  Awesome and cool.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|I was unable to view this film at all, saw not 5 minutes before it was cut off, kept crashing on me
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I liked the idea for the movie. I would imagine it pretty close to how those Chicago boys<br />tried to do business back in the day. The characters in the story were hardcore for sure.<br />Could have done without the heart felt, boy girl crap. Wasted to much time that could<br />have been used for more shoot outs and ass whippings. The character that Shia Labeouf<br />played should have been dropped from the whole movie. No entertaining reason for the<br />character at all. Real cry baby. I got real tired of the back and forth between him and his girl friend.<br />The two older brothers were what needed to have more time in the movie.  If the movie had<br />had more grit from the two older brothers and less whining from Labeouf's character I would have given<br />it a much higher score.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|it's a funny book but I think the author wrote it way to fast I read it in about 30 minutes and I'm in sixth grade
B004SBX112|5.0|WE are addicted to angry birds. Seriously we need help. Its a problem.. Hahahaha.... my 4yr old wants to quit school and became an angry bird :) Awwesome goals!!

B0066WJLU6|5.0|Pretty cool I suppose. Works nice on nights you wanna find things in the dark and the kids are all passed out in you and yours husbands bed.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have to say I really missed John Corey's character. This is typical Nelson Demille and I really enjoy his sarcasm and wit. Yes, John Corey is arrogant, egotistical, and sarcastic but that is what drives his motivation. Some great one liners but if you didn't like the previous books of this series, you will not like this one.
0061906220|5.0|Cute book, and quick shipping!! My lil guy loves this book. He can read it front to back and feels pretty proud of that!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|In my retirement I have decided to revisit titles from my youth.  No disappointment in Treasure Island.  A &#34;treasure&#34; in itself.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|My 13 yrd old son begged me to watch it with him, I did and was surprise that I liked it. Although it reminded me of Lord Of The Flies with the violence among the kids....ehhhh
0385536828|3.0|I enjoy McEwan's work and read pretty much all of it.  Only exception here is I find him somewhat repetitive.  But cracking story and interesting period.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Susan Bee<br /><br />Really enjoy the circus like feel of this movie.  It is genius how they brought new idea's to an old story.  The mirror being her own reflection of her own common sense was over the top brillent!  And lets face it, Julia Roberts??? Heck yeah!
B0018OFNHC|4.0|Good movie to watch how Pacino and Penn mature and expand as actors.  Great plot, good action, unexpected ending, with love thrown in.
B0045EJY90|3.0|This CD player may not satisfy.  Don't get me wrong.  I really wanted to like this. Many will find it a great solution for their ears and their system at a great price for the features.  Maybe 90% of you will, but this review is for the 10% who can tell the difference.  When my first \\"quality\\" CD player (Rotel) died just after it's 5-year warranty was up, I decided CD players were all the same and basically disposable, so I stayed in the $100 range after that.  This time I decided to purchase this TEAC player because of the USB port with decent DAC, the overall positive reviews, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews on the big brother TEAC PD-H600 (thinking there may be a quality trickle-down). I received the product and let it burn in for a few days before making any judgment on the sound.  As far as features go, I greatly appreciated how it operates.  I really missed having all the standalone CD player features while using a DVD play-it-all unit.  The USB works fine, as long as you remember to select tracks using \\"Enter\\" from the remote instead of \\"Play.\\" Remote is small and could be better designed, but I got used to it.<br /><br />I casually listened to it a few weeks and just felt that something was not right.  I compared it with the Sony DVD player this was to replace, and found it less colored, but with an appearance of less bass (it was there, but maybe a little thin).  MP3s played great, but they might have been better recordings than some of the 80's era CDs I was playing.  Yet I was experiencing listener fatigue, and noticed violins sometimes sounding strident.<br /><br />Finally I took it in to a local audio store to compare, and they pitted it against the NAD C546BEE ($500) with USB and the Rotel ($700) without USB.  Still, I was having trouble identifying exactly what I was hearing.  I compared the Marantz 6004 with USB and (personally being a little turned off by NAD in general) took it home for an audition so I could take my time comparing it to the P650.  There just aren't a lot of options under $1k.<br /><br />The Marantz is a beast!  Heavy and huge.  Display scrolls track info of more recent CDs unless you begin by selecting a later track.  You have to select USB from the unit as it is not an option on the remote. Remote is well-designed and easy to use.  Now to the comparison.<br /><br />My home system revealed quite clearly what the problem was.  Upper midrange and into the treble was excessive, making the player sound louder than the Marantz.  It also caused the violins in early chamber music to sound strident.  The Marantz was smoother overall and clearly better sounding with fuller bass, and yet...also not quite right.<br /><br />Moving away from classical to classic rock and pop, I found most of the music sounding better on the Marantz.  The TEAC made the piano in Aqualung sound worse than the recording really is while the Marantz made it listenable.  But would you believe this? Well-produced albums like the Alan Parsons Project and Chip Davis's work on Mannheim Steamroller were clearly better on the cheap TEAC.  My 7-year old daughter put it best when describing the sound on the TEAC:  \\"It just sounds like you are really there.\\"  That was it!  The Marantz is dull and doesn't \\"punch\\" when it's supposed to.  Cymbals and snares don't spit the way they should.  Chip Davis on the drums is relegated to the sidelines.  I feel removed from the sound, while the TEAC lets me feel like I'm there, more spacious.<br /><br />So could I be satisfied with the TEAC? Adjusting the treble tone control down while playing the TEAC a bit helped, but not enough to cure the problem for other types of music.  Yet the TEAC also sounds like it has more reverb or something like it in that troublesome mid-to-high range, and that can't be corrected by tone adjustment.  Playing pop music showed the Marantz a clear winner because of this feeling of reverb or echo in the TEAC.  My wife even noticed the difference clearly, and she doesn't care--just wants this to be over!<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'll be returning the TEAC.  I also will not be purchasing the Marantz 6004 (though I could definitely live with it if I wanted to).  So a simple foray into a USB MP3 solution left me amazed at the inadequacy of CD players in the below $500 tier.  What to do?  The TEAC PD-H600 is no longer available and doesn't have USB. I would love to hear the Parasound zcd in this price range, but suspect I would not be satisfied.  Emotiva looks interesting, but no USB.  Besides, no one locally carries them.  What do you do? Keep buying cd players and then paying return costs? So after much deliberation, I decided to give up on USB and just burn CDs until I find a reasonable MP3 solution.  I just ordered an open box TEAC PD-H600 that just came available from OneCall for under 600, so hopefully that will satisfy (keep checking, they come available every so often).  Wow, I never expected to find myself in that price range!<br /><br />System used: Arcam Alpha (2) and Paradigm 5se speakers (both from 1989).  Still blows me away after all these years!<br /><br />Thank you stacy42 (despite your detractors, you are spot-on in my experience with these players), Sam's Play Around and all the critical reviewers of Marantz and TEAC products.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Product came quickly, and in great condition.  We played it on our DVD player, and there are no scratches or issues.  Thank you.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Up there with Rudy, Remember the Titans, and the Natural!  Love the message, love the attitude. Have watched it many times before, but rented it for my Fire on a recent plane trip, perfect!  Made the trip go fast and felt great afterwards, highly recommend this movie!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love the fact that I can do a puzzle without wondering where to put it. I did puzzles all the time but had to keep moving them when I needed the space. All the good places with good light are used often. With my kindle I never have to worry about light and I don't have to store the puzzles in my closet.<br />With this app being free how could it get much better?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a must read for any teen or adult! I was a little hesitant to read it at first (I like fantasy stories better) but once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. TPOBAW is truly one of the best, and most inspiring books I've ever read. It touches on many topics about being a high schooler, and has strong, unique characters that intertwine perfelectly into this beautifully written novel. It's a story that will be everlasting in my memory. If you enjoy the book, watch the movie as well. Although it's a little different, the message is still portrayed perfectly, and the actors did a fenominal job of bringing the story to life.
0684857219|5.0|Great book, full of so much information an techniques, it has been such a great addition to my workouts. Being able to just tweak what I already know has allowed me to increase my gains. I definitely recommend this
0547884591|5.0|The book showed up this morning.  Not sure what the mailman was doing here at 7:30 am?, BUT..  I flipped it open and felt inspired to immediately try out the scrambled egg recipe.  So I dove right in.  The whole time making them I just KNEW they aren't going to come out good but I'm following directions the best I can anyway.  Basically to prove the book wrong and to solidify the fact that I suck at cooking.<br /><br />So.. lo and behold!  Best scrambled eggs I've ever had by a long shot.  Certainly the book, at the very least, improved my egg making ability by 5000% in under 10 mins!
B000641D2Y|5.0|Good show to have for the holiday. We know you can see them on TV But it fun to have your own.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season will not disappoint! The action is great and the characters continue evolve. The is the best show on t.v!
B00005LOUP|5.0|My family really enjoy this show. It is really good show to add to your holiday collection. Good Christmas show...
B002ZG9846|5.0|Worth the price and came in as I wanted. The buyer shipped it correctly and on time as well. Good job
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This monitor arm has great flexibility for mounting options is easy to adjust and does everything I need it to. I use this arm at my desk for work and I adjust the height several times a day. I both sit and stand at my desk and it has plenty of adjustment.
B00A03WBVI|4.0|Many of the critics say this was just not right for a second CD. Still, I found plenty to enjoy. A couple of songs are a bit ridiculous with lyrics. How did those boys do it with out laughing? Especially, ROCK ME. Hopefully, Harry's hair isn't too big now from all the hoopla of this new CD.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|No way to start or restart another game after you fail a level, you have to close the app and open it again to keep playing.
B00979OL5A|4.0|We love playing this game more than we like watching the movie. The graphics are nice and the movement and action are better than a lot of games. Add in the fact that it was a free download and it just keeps getting better.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I am a big Woody Allen fan and just love his unique story lines.  Not all have been box office successes, but I appreciate the genius mind behind the script and behind the camera. The beauty of Paris has been captured in this film and the story line is great in bringing to life the historical characters of that era. Again his choices of music are a joy and contribute greatly to his films.  I love his comedy and his insight into relationships.  I feel that the people who don't get his humour or sense of irony are missing out on so much.
B0086700CM|3.0|My son plays it alot more than I would but it has good graphics. Once I get the hang of it on the tablet I am sure I will enjoy it also.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Ordered for a Kindle Fire because my old one is worn out. Defintely need covers for your kindles if you drop them as I do.  I&#34;m sure if I do not like I can return it to Amazon as I have never had any trouble with returns. Came as described and on time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive and I really wish I had it on my laptop also. Once I started playing it I couldn't stop.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|This is an extremely good album. I can't really think of any song that I didn't like, no filler in this album. Highly recommended for any Deftones fan.
B009P5S11G|4.0|\\"Talk that Talk\\" was the first Rihanna album I'd ever purchased; not because I wasn't a fan but because her singles were so hit and miss. In my opinion, talk that talk was a great album. It had a lot of energy and grit and a great balance of the two.<br /><br />It's easy to appreciate the hurt and heart she's put into this album. Though most of her albums have a common theme (tragedy and triumph), this one feels as if she's giving the audience more of herself by being completely exposed.<br /><br />\\"Get it over with\\" is all written within a hidden text and beautifully so. It is one of my FAVORITE songs on the album. It allows the listener to relate, let loose and vibe with the synths of the track and the meaning to be taken in this subliminal tone. Though at first I initially thought it was an interlude, as a track it definitely holds its own.<br /><br />\\"Love song\\" (only because I am so against FUTURE and everything he's about) is garbage. I understand the need to collab/market with a new up and coming artist, but FUTURE was a horrible choice.<br />If T-Pain murdered Auto-tune then FUTURE is the serial killer that's yet to have been caught. Ghastly..<br /><br />\\"Diamonds\\" is obviously a hit, as is \\"Fresh off the runway\\" especially for those of you who are club heads. I myself enjoy a good beat from time to time, though the lyrics are lacking.<br />\\"Stay\\" and \\"What now\\" are great ballads. She delivers a very convincing emotional performance.<br /><br />\\"Lost in Paradise\\" is a great closer. It's light and hearty, which gives the listener a chance to reflect on the journey they've just taken. There were some up's and downs...happy times and sad, but in the end...RIRI will always come out on top.<br /><br />A-
B007EECSFA|5.0|I liked this book because it so accurately captured the essence of peoples' lives both during and after the war.  Also, it had an amazing turn of events that you wouldn't expect.  I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate the product of a skillful writer.
0395389496|5.0|I love that a CD of the story was included and an ornament. It makes the book extra special and a great value for the price!
B00A0SMTXS|5.0|I loved it, Kate beckensale is simply amazing, Jessica biel just as amazing!!!! Colin Farrell just as good if not better then Arnold
0802473156|5.0|This is a wonderful book that allows you to learn about yourself and your spouse. It also helps you relate to others and the way they express love towards you.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is the best show to come out of a network in a long time. I normally stick to my HBO series, for production value and \\"edgier\\" themes, but this show satisfies immensely. The production value and writing style is right up there with the best premium channel series, and next to \\"Game of Thrones\\" it is my favorite tv show of the year. Even better, it is actually family friendly. I bought this for my parents when my dad was ill, and I knew they were a bit bored. Since their favorite show is \\"Dancing with the Stars\\", I figured it was a bit of a risk. They loved it so much they couldn't stop watching it from the first night, and stayed up late just to see what happens. It kept them entertained and my dad kept thanking me over and over for sending it. Of course I had to get one for myself as well! I think this show will appeal to LOTS of different ages and tastes in your house, I would recommend it to anyone...
B0090SI42Y|5.0|Can't wait for the Blu-ray, saw it twice in movies loved every minute.  RZA acting needs work but great movie point blank period.  Can't wait to see what is next. Wu-Tang Forever.
B008AITJ24|3.0|The writers of Bones have definately lost focus.  Bones used to be edgey.  Season 7 does not compare to the bold episodes found in at least the first 4-5 seasons.  The quality of the recording is great, the loss of so many episodes because of Emily's pregnancy is disheartening.  The price per episode really goes up.  Still, if you have watched them all like my wife and I have, they continue the saga.  Few new viewers will be interested.  The long term viewers will buy it.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|AWESOME show and the first season is quite an introduction to the serial killer with a conscience.  Highly recommend to all.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Totally entertaining followup to a great first season. Former characters in new roles add a devilish twist. Fantastic storytelling and plots.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game! Great way to relax after a hard day at work. Easy to play and fun!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Assuming,as usual, this author has diligently done his research, he paints a vivid picture for the minds eye. To the point you are on the task force taking out the Panther... brilliant and humorous
B00004Y87O|5.0|This inspired a video game series, man! What a good film. Every movie about prisons in the 2000s is based off this movie. Russel is genius in his character; soft spoken, hardened veteran, convict, and sex symbol. Freakin' Issak Hayes! hahaha. Amazing.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Buy this and chill out have a laugh remember the good times.<br /><br />They don't make movies like this anymore. A must own no doubt.
0307387178|5.0|Brings to light the story of this naive and intelligent young man. Krakauer is a great writer and this books shows it.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|It was a very good movie great special effects and good fight sequences. However, it leaves a big gap between the last movie. It leaves the viewer bewildered as to what is actually going on for the first 30 minutes of the film. Then it seems like it goes back to the first movie and it's self discovery all over again. Parts of the film actually seem to come straight out of Watchmen and it seemed almost like I was watching Night Owl and not Batman. In my opinion it just seems like the director built up a huge climax in the second film only to have it quickly fall into a disorderly finale.
0930289234|5.0|Wish I could get my hands on the original comics but this graphic novel compilation is superb. Amazing story and anyone interested in reading anything that has to do with anything needs to pick this up.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Found this fun and interesting.  I did get the accompaning app for this but am unable to get it to work
B000MCH5P4|4.0|If you can take its pace, this movie is worth it. The story arcs are great, the characters are built well, and the direction is almost flawless. Again, not for everyone, but if you're into slowly-paced story building, give it a try.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|Tim Ferris must be obsessive compulsive.  The strange but fascinating experiments he conducts and the interesting findings he shares make this an entertaining, as well as a very informative read.  Despite not following his advice properly and having a number of &#34;cheat&#34; days I have still managed to get remarkable results.  Even if you do nothing and just read the book it will be a boon to your experience on this planet.
B00005JN0T|5.0|It's cheesy, it's hollywood, it's Will Smith. But it's based on amazing short stories and I love it. Whatever. Will Smith is still and will always be the man.
B0064BWE8U|1.0|I consider this to be a light, cheap, fun-filled kind of book. It's $18 for the Kindle version.. you've got to be joking me. It's worth about $7.00 max. I gave it one star simply because of this. This novel is light and a quick read, but for $18? That's a complete joke.
0553278223|5.0|Bradbury was a genius and this work shows it. Recommended to anyone who loves novels in general, but especially to sci-fi fans... which seems to be everyone now-a-days.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|This app constantly wants to be updated but will never complete the update process on the Kindle Fire.  Very annoying to constantly be reminded of the update.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|One of his best roles, if not his best role. The direction of this movie, the cinematography is superb. Everything about this movie is great. Lewis' lines are delivered with perfect cadence. Some times he's so scary with his delivery, you have to laugh to avoid being afraid.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys make fantastic music.  In many cases I prefer their covers to the original songs, such as What Makes You Beautiful.  Code Name Vivaldi is a fantastic track that gives me goosebumps.  The entire album is really wonderful.  It is great to listen to artists with real musical talent.  The skills it takes to put together these arrangements amazes me.
B000OVLBHG|4.0|Huge fan of Heinlein but never read this book. The movie is still amazing; after many viewings, I still love it.
B000F3T7X8|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's, but I somehow managed to miss Japan.  I've heard about them for years, because I listen to Dali's Car, and I'm a fan of Duran Duran; Japan always seems to come up in discussion of these artists (for good reason).  Recently, I've become a fan of Ryuichi Sakamoto, and through him of David Sylvian.  That pathway led me finally to this--Gentlemen Take Polaroids.  I'm now incredibly frustrated that I resisted the siren song of Japan for so long, for this album is a masterpiece of the New Romantic--sonically, a fascinating mixture of pulsing 80's synths, suave vocals, insistent beats, and amazing bass work.  Sylvian's voice is different here than it is now--less mannered, less full of vibrato, but still rich and smooth, a perfect counterpoint to the excellent songcraft on display here.  This is simply a perfect encapsulation of all the promise that the late 70's/early 80's cutting edge pop had to offer--danceability, mystery, excitement. Highly recommended for fans of anyone that I have name checked above, and for anyone who enjoys great 80's music.  Masterful.
B00005JL78|5.0|The short story is infinitely better, but this adaptation is still worth watching. Tom Cruise, despite his mental state, is a fun actor and the story arc of this movie is worth watching.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love everything about this film you will stay awake with all the action that is a good thing!<br />Do see Taken you will love it!
B000ZN802W|5.0|Can't remember if I read the book first... regardless, this movie is a great adaptation of the book and story of Chris Mcandless Hirsch plays the part so well; naivety with a hint of absolute intelligence. Hal Hobrouck (sic) is insanely good in the 10 minutes he's in the film.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|I still love hearing Annie Lennox sing. From her early work with The Tourists, to the classic tunes with the Eurythmics, and her early solo recordings, she has given us some great, memorable music. But I'm not hearing anything on this album that remotely ranks among her best songs or makes me go \\"wow!\\" There are a few good songs, and Annie gives them her typically heartfelt vocal treatment. Emotion and soul still counts for something. But again, the tunes are just okay to good; I don't hear any classics or things you would expect other singers to cover. I'm sure this will please most longtime fans, but unlikely to win her any new devotees.
B0000029DD|5.0|If Buckley's falsetto doesn't get you teary eyed, then you need not listen. But, in my humble opinion, this is one of the best albums ever. Every song is a joy to listen to; though sometimes melancholy, the bitersweet tone of the man's voice is superb. Amazing song writing and he definitely put Hallelujah on the map as a beautiful piece of work. Cohen's haunting piece is made even more somber and sweet by this wonderful artist.
B006VGGAC4|3.0|Well I am two thirds of the way through this book and while it's no masterpiece of prose, it is highly readable and very intersting so far.<br />Of course Arnold paints himself with gold throughout as the \\"immigrant done good\\" to the point where you start to question the credibility of his version of events.<br />However,his entreprenurial side is actually very impressive, and I was surprised to learn he was a real estate millionaire before he ever made money from movies.<br />Say what you will about his recent fall from grace, Arnold has packed a lot of living into his years (Perhaps the political years will be of least interest to non American readers)and overall it makes for an intersting story about a driven and focused individual.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is polarizing, but so is everything. Whoever thinks this movie isn't funny has no funny bone. I thought we were all born with one...
B0091VTNZC|5.0|I really enjoy this new classic. I love this movie. It is a great movie for the holidays or just to watch at anytime.
0887081770|5.0|My kids (ages 4 and 6) love all of Eric Carle's books and have since I can remember.  All of his books are must-haves for the reading collection.
034580404X|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I have read all three books twice.  It was a great price and delivered in a timely fashion.  Nice transaction.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book.  Would I read it again?  No.  What can I compare it to?  No clue.  Some of it was mindboggling and almost unbelievable - but it's a book.  Entertaining?  Yes.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|After reading the book, I was a bit disappointed as the movie did not give much of the backstory of the why A.L became a vampire hunter. But it was ok
B00846REIS|5.0|Ahhhh...book 2.  Love it.  Loved book one.  Along the lines of 50 Shades, but almost better.  Gideon was impossible not to fall in love with.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My order got damaged when it shipped, so I let the company know, and they gave it to me for half off! What a deal!
0805092447|4.0|My son did a section at Kindergarten based on this book and wanted to have it at home to read.  Both kids love reading it.  Great addition to our collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Picture quality is great! The case seems to be sturdy and has a leathery feel to it. I guess this is meant to give you a sense that you are touching Batman's mask.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I almost liked this series better than 50 Shades.  Almost.  The characters in this series also have issues, but at least they both do and I felt like it was more equal.  Hard to put these books down.  Can't wait for the last one in the series to come out.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|this is a really fun game, easy to get and challenging at times. it will keep you entertained for hours.
0399213015|5.0|This TINY little book is a classic, of course.  My kids love reading it and now that they are starting to read on their own, it's a favorite.
B000005ALP|5.0|I just loved this CD! The songs are creative, they not only sound good but have a good different message in the lyrics. I recommend it!
0060254920|5.0|This book is a kids' classic!  Bought it for my son when he was in kindergarten, and again for my grandson 25 years later.  Really encourages their imagination.  Excellent illustrations.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album.  Was down and out for a while, didn't know if I'd make it through the week, but this album pulled me off the ledge. This music is way better than suicide.
B003N0XDT4|4.0|I'm an intermediate audiophile and multi-instrumentalist who bought this as an addition to my MIDI/ASIO set-up. For the price, it's an good starter. Charge out of the box takes a while(about 3-4 hours), but the battery lasts a LONG time, depending on how often you use it, as it ook close to 2 weeks before I could do a full battery cycle, and charges as it's plugged into the PC. In the box you get the basic stereo cable (3.5mm-3.5mm audio line-out) so if you plan on using it with an IPOD you'll need to purchase the L9 line out dock, if you're big on audio quality, which is assumed if you're considering a portable amp in the first place. Comes with USB cable for PC hook-up. Bass? Fuh-get-about-it! It has 3 levels for bass, I'm good with 1. I would suggest a good pair of phones that have been sufficiently 'burned-in' before you go and start pushing the 'lows'. It's about the same size as an IPOD classic, maybe a few mm thicker, not too heavy. For more info, FIIO has a site, specs are laid out well but good luck with the write up/user manual as it is poorly translated(?). My 'minus a star'  is for the equalizer; only bass adjustable, no user manual(though it is fairly simlpe/intuitive), and the fact that I feel it should include an LOD... Otherwise, I'm very satisfied.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you love his previous books, Rick Riordan scores again! Honestly couldn't put it down, and I'm 21! Can't wait for the next one :)
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I orderd this cable because i lost the original one.  Love it because I can also charge my blackberry and other devices.
B007NMN2US|4.0|Another xmas gift for daughter.  looks amazing!<br />Exited to see her reaction upon receiving it.  Looks just like in ad.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I can't sleep when I'm not in my own bed at home. So when I travel, I use this app to help me sleep. Loops perfectly without noticeable flaws, and there's plenty of choices for sounds, something for everyone. If you're having trouble sleeping, give this app a try, it sure helps me when I'm out of town.
B001LXIDVS|4.0|It has not been opened due to it being one of our daughter's xmas gift.<br />it looks fine. packaging was fine
1609611543|5.0|If the average person understood what is in this book and applied the principles, their health would take a quantum leap.  For both the professional and the typical patient, this is pure gold.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I bought this to replace my older individual DVD's and get everything into one box set. The video and sound is what you would expect for the age of the movies. Do not expect 7.1 surround sound.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|First watching it on the kindle was great.  Good picture & sound. Now for the movie. Loved the cast of characters. They played off each other so great. I watched it 2xs. But if your going to watch this movie make sure you watch the &#34;super hero&#34; movies that came before this one.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Having had the privilege of visiting Beijing this summer and seeing some of the area where all of this took place really made this story come alive.  The descriptions are so accurate of the area.  You can truly feel the pain and frustrations of the investigators and the families.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I downloaded the game & played it for like 5 mins & decided to get rid of the game. However I kept playing cause I wanted the next prize. Now several months later I still have the game.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Just great to see Jimmy and Robert still standing and performing after all the coke, horse ,pills, booze , ect ect and still be alive and well  just putting out the music like that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Being from the Detroit Area I had not heard of Rodriquez until I saw him on 60 Minutes.  What a treasure we have here!  This is a wonderful CD - the music and lyrics are great.  Now I want more!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My daughter introduced me to this series and I could not stop watching it. It has everything a woman loves!!
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Purchased as a gift! So far no complaints so I'm happy!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been listening to the Piano Guys for around 6 months now, it all started with Cello Wars (which is still one of my favorite songs/videos). Ever since I heard that first song I have been addicted to listening to them. They have some of the most creative and amazing sounding music I've heard and I'm picky about the musicianship of the bands I listen to. They have a multitude of methods to play various instruments and have a unique sound to them. I absolutely love these guys! For anyone who is fan of classical music, instrumental, or just really well done music I would suggest getting this CD!! Take a listen to them on Youtube and see for yourself.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Purchased as a gift! So far no complaints so I'm happy!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I discovered the Piano guys last year. They are my absolute favorite music to listen to. I listen to them EVERY day. The music they play is so uplifting, it brightens my day! Some times it makes me cry, in a good way. Love you guys!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Purchased as a gift! So far no complaints so I'm happy!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This movie was boring.  Very little action from Batman, who<br />spent most of the time whining and sore from old age.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Purchased as a gift! So far no complaints so I'm happy!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. This really keeps the screen from sliding. Hands free!  Less money!  Gma can now be hands free!  She's happy
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Purchased as a gift! So far no complaints so I'm happy!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I am a huge admirer of these guys. I found them on YouTube (well, I have been subscribed to Kevin since he was a beat-boxing cello player in Japan!) When they came out with the Christmas album, I knew I had to pick up a copy to mix into my Christmas playlist. It has been a great addition!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is definitely better than the movie. I would read it again and I am still waiting to read the next one in the series.
B0086700CM|4.0|My girls love playing this game.  It is fun and addictive.  The one thing I've noticed as they have advance in playing is that there are no black female characters.  Please create a black female character that they can use while they are playing this very fun game!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|You need to add this CD to your collection. I love their Youtube videos, incredible photography and music. But what enticed me to snap up their CD as soon as it was available was the impeccable musicianship. Their music stands on it's own, and is as pleasing to the ear as their videos are to the eye. Their joy of music, their mirth, comes through in their playing so that I listen to them over and over again. My wife has taken to playing their CD all the time as well. Both of us agree it was money well spent!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am so happy to have found The Piano Guys. I have young children, and it's so nice that there is music out there that all of us can enjoy. What's even better is that their music videos are so family friendly. It is a rare thing to find music that can be enjoyed just as much by me, as by my one year old. I bought this CD and my children will be getting it for Christmas and I can tell you they will be so excited and this will become our new \\"on the road\\" tunes. Check out their youtube videos and then come back and buy their CD. You won't regret it.
0307949486|3.0|Kind of a mixed bag.I liked the Swedish setting. I also enjoyed the main plot, the 36 year old mystery of the disappearance of Harriet Vangar, set up as a kind of a 'locked room' mystery.<br />I didn't like the framing story of Blomkvists libel trial and the roller coaster fortunes of his magazine. Once the main mystery is solved the book continues for another hundred pages or so. Especially as it comes with a large dose of 'Journalist as society's saviour' vibe -yuck. I also didn't care for the character of Lisbeth. We get it: she's tough and rebellious- she even has piercings, tattoos and wears leather! Newsflash, so does my 50 year old neighbour. And every time they encounter some insurmountable obstacle, here is Lisbeth's magic computer to save the day! Deus Ex Apple. But the main mystery, with all the Vangar family's closets full of skeletons, is enough for 3 stars.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|I like this one, but maybe it's time for Sam and Dean to no always be upset with each other.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|I love the video quality of this set.  However, the audio, simply coming through my television, has to be turned way up to be able to hear it.  I suppose this is because it is designed to be run through surround sound systems, which I don't have.  Other than that, the set is great!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Packaging was in perfect condition!!  So happy that the quality was perfect!  Will purchase from buyer again. I got this set plus another movie for less than The fifth season would have cost me at a store.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I decided to buy the album after hearing a few of the songs on Youtube. All very good stuff. Like anything, there's a few songs that I didn't get into, but that was made up for by the majority of great songs on the album. Definitely worth the $10.
B00198X0VS|5.0|You put these two guys in a movie and you know what your going to get. It is so funny. And the special effects are awesome, I love it and the other two are just as good.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I love fairy tales and am always interested to see someone's different take on them. Thought this was a good spin on it. Charleze Theron is amazing as the evil queen and it's nice to see Kristen in something other than Twilight.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Wanted to see this movie and missed it at the theater.  Now I have it in my collection.  It was a great movie and I will watch it over and over.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Once again she's back with another amazing album! She brings an array of music, from club beats to her always powerful ballads. Love Her!!! Can't wait to hear what she does next.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really enjoy the Piano Guys' music! Their music has such emotion and depth, and they have put some amazing twists on some well know songs. I listen to them while doing homework. If I'm having a bad day, I go watch them on youtube - Steve could make anyone smile.
B008J34466|4.0|I thought this CD was pretty good, one of her better ones for sure. She does her thing as usual.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for any adult.  It's a wonderful story about a boy who lets go of most things society thinks are necessary for living a happy life.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Not a bad album. It's got all her best and a few new songs too so it doesn't disappoint if you're a Kelly Clarkson fan.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was almost certain I was going to buy this CD for myself earlier this year. As it turns out the CD is on Spotify, and I haven't stopped listening to it. Good guy Piano Guys. So I'm going to buy this cd for a friend for Christmas.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I teach elementary school Physical Education and was teaching basketball lessons. Thhis movie is a great movie for children and adults alike.
B007PP2J9I|1.0|The book tries to be a detective/thriller but doesn't succeed at it, instead you're left with a predictable story and main characters who just have a lot of luck because they're &quot;the good guys&quot;. Quite boring. When the geeky, IT and security aspects come into the plot they're interesting but just don't support the story, to me it always felt like a side-track.<br /><br />I read the whole book because at times I thought it would get better only to be disappointed later on. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|What more can I say? This movie is brilliant. I rented it for 48 hours, and I'll probably watch it at least two more times while I have it. Note: if you don't at least get a little misty throughout the end montage, you are not a human being.
1574216988|5.0|Get this book. It improved my skills and provided a lot of new ideas. Get it today. You will enjoy it too.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Most of what I would say to review this film has been said.  It you rate films by special effects, shoot em up, kill them all and abuse their women folk, then this is not for you.  This film gives you a good, warm feeling throughout. Not that it doesn't touch briefly on the \\"seamy\\" side as most of the babies in the church look just like Colm Meany's Morgan the Goat, though why Morgan hasn't gone to war is not mentioned. The only drawback is the Irish actors playing Welsh characters and occasionally slipping up in their accents.<br />If you don't speak Welsh you miss a very delightful comment by Williams the Petroleum.  When the Englishmen's car is sabotaged they push it to the local garage. Williams breaks a rod and says, \\"I see what's wrong with your car but I don't know what you call this in English. In Welsh we call it \\"bethyngalw\\".  There is no more comment on this.  Bethyngalw in Welsh simply means \\"watchyemaycallit\\".<br /><br />Good film to watch with others.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Update October 9, 2014: I just purchased my third Snugg case. This time for the IPhone 6. This new model outdoes the previous ones. As in my previous review I am still impressed with the wearability of the case. The first one only wore out because of my harsh treatment of the case, but it absorbed the abuse with no damage to my phone. The only complaint I had with the previous cases was that my wife had trouble getting the phone out if she wanted to use it. This new case has rectified that problem. She finds it simple to use. A terrific case made better.     -------------    Have had the Snugg for a few months. Bought it just because it was the only case available when the iPhone 5 came out. I worried that it wasn't real leather, a number of reviews pointed that out, but it wears well. I, also, worried about the elastic (an essential item for getting the phone out--it is snug) but, so far no problems. I now have consolidated my wallet and phone into one compact item that easily slips into my pocket (with the help of a broccoli rubber band to attach bills to the Snugg).    Despite how tightly the phone and my credit cards fit into the Snugg, I have learned ways to quickly remove the phone and cards. I, certainly, don't worry about them falling out accidentally.    This is a good, inexpensive case.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I'm surprised by all the good reviews of this one. It's poorly written, trite, and has two-dimensional characters. About a third of the movie takes place in the office of the therapist, with Steve Carell in the utterly miscast role. These scenes alternated between cringingly embarrassing and snoozingly boring.<br /><br />Meryl Streep was terrible in the role, and Tommy Lee Jones was really hard to look at. Watching them pretending to try to have sex was just painful!!!<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this, as Meryl Streep is one of my faves, but I was glad when the closing credit rolled.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire Hd .  Don't know why everyone else had problems.  Maybe they fixed the problem.  I really like that it alerts me when the battery is low.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have the fantastic ability to take modern music and put a classical spin on them. Whether your taste of music is Bach, Coldplay, film scores, or David Guetta- You are in for a treat. As an individual who appreciates all types, this is the perfect album.
1401224792|4.0|FABLES WEREWOLVES OF THE HEARTLAND was a story I found pretty entertaining though regrettably not up to the usual par. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to Fables, so I liked it. It was certainly more than a bit campy at times (although in an unintentionally hilarious way it seemed to be playing it COMPLETELY serious) kept me reading it all in one sitting since to the story's credit it was very well done in regards to action and pacing. That's why I've given it 4/5. I'm a really big Fable fan and if you are too I'd give it a recommendation, particularly if the Fables story featuring Bigby's WWII adventures interested you. I found that one interesting so I found this book to be worth buying. On the chance you didn't feel engaged by that story, it might be best not to give this a buy or wait till the library carries it.<br /><br />**The Rest of this Review contains SPOILERS**<br /><br />I feel that I should talk about the artwork first. I always love Craig Hamilton's work in Fables, since he worked on one of my favorite stories \\"the Last Castle\\", he has a very distinct detailed style that I like to see. The other artist listed as the other primary artist here Jim Fern did great as well. I found the art to be very nice here. The cover was also nice, though it's different from the usual symbolic covers of Fables, BUT I like it cause it depicts a moment from the book while still leaving mystery and intrigue.<br /><br />Although I love the work of these artists, the art presented a major problem in this book in regards to the consistency of the character design. Quite a lot of characters have one hairstyle/hair color then a completely different one a few pages down the line. In a story where the inhabitants of this town are mostly fair skinned, blond, and blue eyed (to fit the story parallel to the idea of an Aryan race) it is pretty difficult to keep track of so many blonds who's features are inconsistent. For example, Arthur Harp begins the story with light brownslicked back hair then after a flashback his hair is pale blond, then after about a chapter of him not appearing for a bit his hair is parted in the center with the back and sides shaved which looks NOTHING like how he appeared prior. I had to ask myself if this was an entirely different character when he changed so drastically. And this isn't the only example, it happened with quite a few more like Carl and Orel. I know these artists have talent at drawing unique faces and hairstyles, it shouldn't be so difficult to choose one for a character and remain consistant to it.<br /><br />The story begins with Bigby scouting for a new territory to become Fabletown after Mister Dark took it over in the previous main title stories. If you're a fan of ABC's series Once Upon a Time, you may notice something of a shout out to Storybrooke of Once Upon a Time when Bigby mentions \\"The Maine possibility turned out to be impossible for a number of reasons.\\" It seems like a reference to how Fables was in the works to be an ABC series before the idea of OUaT came out. Just what I thought.<br /><br />While in Iowa Bigby comes into contact with a Wolf Pack spawned from his blood and two prominent figures from his WWII adventure. His former-enemy an ex-Nazi biochemist Sieglinde and his former war buddy Sergeant Arthur Harp. During this tale Bigby finds out that after the two seemed to have died their bodies absorbed enough of his blood to gain his healing abilities and werewolf form. Through forming connections with Bluebeard and using Sieglinde's expertise in blood work they started their own race and city in Story City. I thought this connection to Bigby's past was a great opportunity since I had always liked the story of Bigby in the wartime, but it was underdeveloped in certain important parts here, particularly Harp's character, he was war buddies with Bigby yet that entire aspect of their past and the interesting werewolf-spawn connection takes a backstage to the town's problems;which I found much less interesting.<br /><br />About the town's problems there's a group of characters in Story City who plan to overtake Bigby and feast on his body in parallels to the Death of Christ, but to be honest that wasn't really given enough time to resonate as anything more than a reason for Bigby to create piles upon piles of werewolf carcases. I suppose it didn't really have to be anything more to be honest though because Bigby is a character who can make a flimsy premise fun to read. And to its credit this book was fun to read.<br /><br />There are some prominent plotholes this story had that I feel are big. The most glaring one is the introduction of werewolves being adverse to fire. Now that would be all well and good; however, in the very same book we have Sigi and Harp's survival at Castle Frankenstein (which exploded and BURNED) explained by their werewolf healing abilities. That's one big oversight and I'm pretty surprised that this didn't strike anyone involved in this story's mind as being crazy.<br /><br />Overall, I'd still give it a recommendation to read it at least, since it's the Fables universe and even the stories that are heavy on plotholes and light on deep story and connection to the main plot deserve a viewing. It may not rock your world but I think most will agree that Bigby made the story at least enough fun to be worth your time.
0761171703|5.0|Having visited New York on more than one occasion I always found it hard to convey to other people what kind of place it was....until I found Jordans project! His absolute love of New York City is evident in the stories he tells with the dancers in each of his photographs! He brings New York to life on paper, and its a joy and inspiration to behold! Once I realised that the project extended beyond New York I was hooked and now have an added 10/20 must see places on my extensive travel wish list. I love Jordans whimsical nature and his explanantions of how and when these photos were taken just adds to the charm of this book! It will stand alone as a tour de force in photography, but that wont stop me hoping for a Dancers Among Us, phase 2!!!
B00917IQFY|5.0|This set is the first Graham Parker has done with the Runour in 30 years,and the reunion is one to celebrate.Parker settles for nothing short of that ideal punch to demonstrate his feelings and music.The best one in all is \\"Arlington is Busy\\",which pretty much is explained in the title.I don't know how long he's been busy with this,but it falls into the same category as his other fine works-\\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\",\\"Heat Treatment\\",\\"Howling Wind\\".His voice has mellowed over time,but still finds a way to bring it out nicely.His fans wont be disappointed.
0810989956|5.0|I gave this a solid 5 stars because this is a greta book for kids and especially Diary fans. To be able to write and finish your own book. Finish the comics started by Jeff Kinney. Plenty of pages to write your own diary. Kids will love this book. He should make another.
B000H5TH1Q|4.0|When it comes to contraversional items,this movie certainly has them,in one big bite.The main character is a peeping tom with a telescope,who discovers a killing by the pervert that an attractive woman lures in her abode.He discovers later that the style of the killing is related in a very set way,and could be heading for Holly,an erotic actress featured here who figures this guy(who presents himself as a movie maker to get her attention)is just plain crazy/creepy.Everything backfires as he tries to help her-I wont give away the details.Factual as they try to make it appear,the communications between most all of them are unsettling.They all make a fantastic effort in all of it,however,and is one of Melanie Griffith's best ever.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|My son loves this movie and quite frankly, I like it too. Its very enjoyable. Moves quickly and my son never moves. Love it
B000XXTCF8|5.0|I bought this after previewing the songs pretty much out of curiousity.I wanted to see how much I could possibly get in one set that I could relax with in my MP3.These songs are fine examples of the best of his past works,although they are all worth it in their own way.Nothing short of great songs from 3 decades from the tuneful,soulful poet/musician.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys put an incredible amount of passion and soul into each song, not to mention an awesome amount of creativity.  Sometimes I just put their songs on repeat and listen to them all day long.<br /><br />Every song is a brilliant masterpiece.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one!!!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|This is the reunion concert with 3 of the 4 original Led Zeppelin members.The other is Jason Bonham,the son of the later drummer John Bonham who does a fantasic job.They do the loudness in many styles,including some where Jimmy Page uses a bowstring on his guitar.A celebration not to be missed!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|More enjoyable than the second season, I cannot wait for the remaining episodes, everyone should watch this series you will not be disapointed
B000W11JGG|5.0|Go back to your review section ....I already reviewed this....possibly more than once.seven more words? Get your act together.people. Ghaad!
B0019IB0II|5.0|Whether you are interested in the scientific specifics or not, this book offers a first hand account of how fragile we are, no matter what title we have or accomplishments are under our belt, and how we can all benefit from being a little bit gentler with others and ourselves. Great for people in the medical community, teachers, or anyone who wants a better understanding of self and a greater capacity for empathy towards those in need of help.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The author pulls it off.  Good read, draws you in and doesn't disappoint.  I knew I would like this author after reading her dedication to her Father.  See for yourself!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I am nine and this book is awesome. It plays a really big role in helping me learn new words.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Like millions before me, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />My only word of caution, especially to young readers, is that the theology is misleading Hence, one should not form any lasting opinion about any of the world religions presented in this book. Afterall, it is a work of fiction.<br /><br />Other than that, Life of Pi is a great read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the BEST applications I have downloaded.  It is very user friendly and great resources!!!!  On top of all that it is free!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Over the years, I'd been keeping up with Steve Jobs and his numerous ventures, so it was nice to read the whole story in one book. Most of all, I appreciate the balanced view Isaacson presents.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I purchased this CD as a long time listener of the Piano Guys on youtube and was not disappointed with the quality. It is hands down better than listening free online. My sons also really like the Piano Guys. I love that my boys are inspired to create music for others and that they are interested in classical greats in part because of the creative composition on the Piano Guys! Can NOT wait for the 2nd CD!!
1439190275|4.0|has great guidelines and much common sense..i use most of the recipes weekly and make alot ahead of time also...
B009HV2JT8|5.0|my suggestion on this movie is simple, if the name doesn't catch you don't watch it, if the name appeals to you watch it, it's a good movie but I have found that people who are turned off by the title will 98% of the time hate it while people who think it sounds good 100% of the time love it. The action is great in this and lets face it we all know Lincoln wasn't a vampire hunter but it's fun to think that, hey there could always be a twist in history. It's just a fun movie not made to be taken serious, though I have found people who do :/
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We've enjoyed this CD by the Piano Guys very much.  It's peaceful, uplifting music that always puts me in a good mood!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Does Morrison ever do anything badly?  If so I haven't heard it yet.  I just wish he'd feature some more of the great sax that's on so many of his albums.  No matter.  If he makes it I will buy it!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Rating the trilogy movies this one falls in last place. It's not that it's bad but it didn't have the appeal that Begins and Dark Knight had IMO.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Great melodies, great lyrics, great guitar.  What more can you possibly be looking for?  Oh, yeah, great vocals.  You rule, Bonnie!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The piano guys have a gift for making ordinary songs extraordinary. Every song on this album is beautifully written and beautifully played!
B004N9DVW8|5.0|So happy Amazon had this movie! Loved watching it with my girlfriends! Such a funny and uplifting movie that made me smile
0761163808|5.0|An amazing, ingenious creation!  Each page of this book comes alive with motion - like a paper video player - with an engaging animated clip of an animal in motion. What a wonderful way to learn about nature, or just to have a fun experience up close and personal with the great beasts of Africa.  Already bought 2 copies as gifts for my daughter's friends, and watched many delighted reactions as grown-ups admire the copy I have on my desk at work.  It's really \\"next-generation book,\\" a little treasure for anyone who loves optical wonders and smart art.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game on my kindle, It has provided me with hours of addiction.<br />I also play on my computer, but it is great to have on my kindle so it can travel with me
1452110581|5.0|The person who wrote this book, also author of the Sally Forth comic strips, obviously understands cats and their personalities. I was afraid the poems might just be &#34;cutesy,&#34; but they are cleverly funny and all very different. This is a great &#34;small&#34; gift, or stocking stuffer for cat-lovers on your Christmas list.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The piano guys are amazing! I could listen to their songs all day! I play their cd when I'm painting or even  when I write. Truly one of the most inspirational musicians out there! Can't wait for their next album already!
B005LAIHY0|1.0|An endless series of missed opportunities, inane plotting, poor acting, feckless directing, and banal writing, punctuated by some very good special effects. And now Scott intends to direct a second Blade Runner movie too, apparently in an ongoing effort to ruin his reputation as one of the most important science fiction directors of all time. God help us.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Good sci-fi movie. Decent acting and superb visual effects. I would defiantly watch this movie again. Worth renting it for sure!
B009A9EPLM|5.0|I ordered this CD based on the movie trailers I'd seen.  It arrived promptly - two days before I saw the movie. It was a good price and I've enjoyed it several times  I'd recommend this to anyone who is a John Williams fan and to any history buff.  In fact, I've already recommended the CD and Amazon to several people.
B009LREA1S|4.0|Was defiantly not disappointed in this move. It's almost 3 hours long and the time flew by watching it. Great movie!!
B009MF56GC|5.0|best action movie series since the 80's and it just keeps coming and coming right when you need another action movie fix. Real nice to see the gang from the old movies chewing up bad guys the way they do. Wife and son like it also as it does what a movie is supposed to do, makes you forget what's going on in the real world and spend time with family.
1423140605|5.0|My son has been asking for this since it was released. Hope he can wait til christmas to open it.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|love them..... Went to see them back in the day.  lol  Think I was 12 yrs old.  So glad My mom got the tickets for my Birthday
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Ordered DVD to be shipped to same address as many other purchases but this one said non deliverable address, so went to Walmart and gladly paid $5 more just o get in time for Xmas
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you're looking for amazing music to just chill to, dance to, or just for whatever I HIGHLY recommend choosing The Piano Guys music! What a great group of guys playing so well together. Finally found a CD I'd buy. It's been a few years... :)
B000JQTWPO|5.0|With twists and turns that keep you guessing, The Moonstone is a delight from start to finish. With fabulous characters and a riveting plot, I could hardly put it down. The Moonshine and Woman in White count among my favorite books. It's a shame that Willie Collins didn't write more full length fiction.
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|Pretty mediocre moon phase app. All the essentials are there. Nothing special. But this app hates Zinio for some reason. Whenever I open Zinio, this app force closes and freezes up my phone for a few seconds. Not worth the trouble of you're a big Zinio user.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|awesome movie had me laughing the whole time i plan to watch it again soon definetly a purchase i dont regret making
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Not completely through book, but it is providing insight into a very important about our history, I had never heard before. I had always heard about the criticism about McClellan, but never realized extent of his cowardice and self serving ways. That fact that Lincoln and his cabinet put up with him, reveal how weak the Union side was in military leadership. The loss of Lee to the south, was devastating.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest used to be just another one of those social media sites that I avoided. But upon getting the app for my Kindle Fire its been easy and convenient to find and upload items to my boards and discover a world of possibility.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app!  I can get radio stations locally, nationally, and around the world!  Really a nice thing for those who travel a lot.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game. I have player it foe hours at a time and cant get enough. I love this Game.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Loved the book it fills in a lot of gaps in the story line for all who wanted to know how masterchief was created this will answer all questions. Looking forward to reading the next one.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Excellent lyrics<br />She always amazes me with her bad girl style and intruiging lyrics I can relate to them..her music keeps me afloat
0385344333|2.0|I haven't read all of the Reacher books, but I have read most of them. This series one of the view mainstream series that I try to keep up with, but this book was just disappointing.  It's possible that Mr. Child has taken this character as far as he can.  Maybe in the next book, he will finally make it to his destination.
0307477479|2.0|i am a regular amazon surfer, and the fact that this is the first time i have taken the trouble to submit a review is one measure of what a grossly over-rated piece of humdrum fiction if find \\"goon squad\\" to be. warnings to prospective readers are in my opinion very much in order.  i bought this on the basis of the excited reviews and impressive prizes, but abandoned my first attempt at reading it about a third of the way through out of sheer tedium.  i've now given it a second shot, but after getting a little past the halfway mark i skipped to the last chapter to see if anything of consequence ever happened, save myself further boredom and put the poor damned thing out of its misery.  this is not a terrible novel, just an ordinary and deeply mediocre work of absolutely no distinction, destined for permanent oblivion.  the writing is perfectly competent but otherwise in no way impressive or enjoyable.  the fact that such a book made such a splash and won big prizes is troubling, suggestive of serious malaise in the world of \\"literary\\" fiction.
B005UA0FLE|3.0|This album contains a few really good arrangements, including a remake of the Drifters' White Christmas.  Some of the album, though, sounds like Bubl&eacute; is phoning it in.  A couple of the songs, such as Santa Baby (Santa Buddy) are so cheesy that they are downright hard to listen to.  Overall, there's enough here to make it worth listening to, but it doesn't take full advantage of the talent Bubl&eacute; exhibits on his other albums.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a hard game but it's a fun time had by all. I would suggest this game to everyone, young or old.
630587493X|5.0|Requiring a specific number of words for a review is silly.  I love this movie and that should be enough.
B007JMW46U|4.0|Twelve well written,clever stories<br />I just wonder if they are completely fiction.<br />Did Doyle read the newspapers Holmes did and<br />Base those stories on the news articles?
B009O07NBQ|5.0|In the middle of November 2012, I discovered that Decca Records was, for just a couple of days, streaming the complete \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" score on their web site. There was only one catch: For copyright reasons I couldn't pause the music or skip tracks. Oh -- and it's one hour and forty-five minutes long.<br /><br />To quote Bilbo in the film: \\"Fair enough!\\"<br /><br />I dived right in and listened to the whole lot. As it happened, I was right in the middle of re-reading \\"The Hobbit\\", and the movie isn't out yet as I'm writing this. But that doesn't matter. Good music should be able to stand on its own, and I think Howard Shore has pulled it off again with this epic film score.<br /><br />Later I got more chances to stream the music at a more leisurely pace, and this time took some notes.<br /><br />So, without benefit of having seen the film apart from a few snippets, here are my initial thoughts and impressions. I already have the CD on order. Even if I should never see the film at all, I will still love this music.<br /><br />*** Potential spoiler alert ***<br /><br />I'm assuming that you're somewhat familiar with the plot of \\"The Hobbit\\" as you read this. I'll try not to give too much away, and will hint at certain things, but consider yourself warned -- I can't keep everything secret.<br /><br />Abbreviation key: LOTR = \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; FOTR = \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"; TTT = \\"The Two Towers\\".<br /><br />01) My Dear Frodo (8:04)<br /><br />  The CD starts out with a pastoral sound, Shire music as in LOTR. Then, no doubt as an older Bilbo narrates or remembers events long past, the music takes on a more ominous military quality with drums and trumpets. There is a haunting chorus, leading into a Moria-like Polynesian choral chant.<br /><br />  Could this be a flashback of the Battle of Azanulbizar at the gates of the Mines of Moria? This, in the backstory, is where the Dwarves avenge the death of Thorin's grandfather Thrór, and killAzog the Goblin. It sets up the great enmity between Dwarves and Goblins (Orcs), so central to this movie trilogy's plot, so would be a logical move on the part of the screenwriters.<br /><br />  But no, it seems this is the attack on Erebor instead. An interesting choice of music, in that case.<br /><br />02) Old Friends (4:29)<br /><br />  This track starts out with more familiar Shire music. It's easy to imagine Gandalf talking to Bilbo at Bag End. There is a snippet which in FOTR indicates Bilbo getting a bit flustered, so likely means the same here. Bilbo doesn't like where the conversation is going. It smacks of Adventure, and decent Hobbits want nothing to do with that.<br /><br />  The music gets a bit more ominous towards the end.<br /><br />03) An Unexpected Party (3:52)<br /><br />  I can just imagine Bilbo dealing with a bunch of Dwarves showing up on his doorstep by ones and twos and even in a heap all at once. Guess who's coming to dinner?<br /><br />  There is a new, recurrent playful theme here that slowly picks up the pace as the guests arrive and the pressure mounts inexorably on the host.<br /><br />04) Axe or Sword (5:59)<br /><br />  This track starts with one of the new themes, one that is already starting to sound familiar to me just from listening to the first track. I can imagine Bilbo, Gandalf and the Dwarves discussing serious business and probably recounting key events in the past, such as the coming of Smaug and Gandalf's encounter with Thorin's father.<br /><br />  This new theme -- I wonder if it could be the Erebor motif? It certainly serves as a Dwarf theme, and we'll hear it again and again.<br /><br />05) Misty Mountains (1:43)<br /><br />  If you've seen the previews, you've heard the haunting Dwarven chorus \\"Over the Misty Mountains Cold\\". This tune becomes a major theme for the film. \\"We must away ere break of day.\\"<br /><br />06) The Adventure Begins (2:05)<br /><br />  A hint of Shire music. I can picture Bilbo leisurely waking up the morning after the party, and suddenly learning that he's late for a rendezvous at the inn. The sprightly music somewhat resembles that of Merry and Pippin fleeing from Farmer Maggot in FOTR.<br /><br />07) The World is Ahead (2:20) -- Called \\"Blown Away\\" by the streaming audio player I listened to.<br /><br />  Perhaps Bilbo is being wafted like a leaf down the road, with no way to make it stop as his new adventure begins to unfold. This music resembles that of \\"An Unexpected Party\\".<br /><br />  And then the heroic Misty Mountains theme emerges for the first time. This, like the heroic LOTR Fellowship theme, will sound very good with epic landscape shots.<br /><br />08) An Ancient Enemy (4:58)<br /><br />  This is serious Mordor-type music, as at Mount Doom -- along with the Dies Irae motif. There is a dark chorus sung in an ancient language. Three guesses who the enemy is. But where is he?<br /><br />09) Radagast the Brown (4:55)<br /><br />  An ethereal boys' chorus, befitting a wizard. This is followed by some somewhat nervous-sounding string music. I can imagine Radagast riding along on that crazy sled of his, briefly shown in the previews. It's a major sight gag, so I won't spoil it here.<br /><br />  The music grows darker and more menacing as the track progresses. Perhaps the wizard is discovering the growing threat from the forces of darkness?<br /><br />10) Roast Mutton (4:03)<br /><br />  Three very large, nasty customers are having an argument: are Dwarves and \\"Burrahobbits\\" best boiled, roasted or squashed into jelly? Stay tuned.<br /><br />  There is another recurrence of the heroic Misty Mountain theme mid-track.<br /><br />11) A Troll Hoard (2:39)<br /><br />  Some key ancient Elvish weapons are discovered here, which will play a major role throughout both trilogies. The music aptly fits the mood. The themes all seem to be ones we've heard before, though played in different ways.<br /><br />12) The Hill of Sorcery (3:51)<br /><br />  Startswith the Shire theme, then moves on to Radagast. What dark things is the wizard digging up, and how fast can he get away? More Mordor music, like that of Barad-dûr in LOTR.<br /><br />13) Warg-Scouts (3:02)<br /><br />  Pounding drums and threatening music. This scene isn't in the book, but it appears that the Dwarves aren't going to just waltz into Rivendell without a fight. Hints of the Lothlórien theme right at the end.<br /><br />14) The Hidden Valley (3:52)<br /><br />  This is certainly Rivendell music, as we've heard in LOTR, complete with Elvish chorus. But, there are plenty of variations we haven't heard before.<br /><br />15) Moon Runes (3:20)<br /><br />  Likely, Elrond discovers something on Thorin's map that can only be seen in certain types of moonlight. The music, starting out, has a shimmering quality which Howard Shore has used in the past to depict moonlight -- for instance, in TTT when Faramir discovers Gollum fishing in the Forbidden Pool at night.<br /><br />  More snippets of the Dwarf theme.<br /><br />16) The Defiler (1:14)<br /><br />  Starts out with more brazen Dies Irae stuff.<br /><br />17) The White Council (7:20)<br /><br />  Most likely, the wizards and other mighty ones in Middle Earth are worried about recent developments, and meet to discuss the matter. The Lothlórien theme appears again, telling us that a certain important elf queen is involved.<br /><br />  Slow, ominous Dies Irae music appears more than once, along with creeping Mordor Orc music and a slow version of the Barad-dûr theme.<br /><br />  Like the \\"Council of Elrond\\" in FOTR, this must be a lengthy talking scene. The whole history of Middle Earth will likely hinge on what is discussed here -- and what is decided.<br /><br />18) Over Hill (3:44)<br /><br />  Starts with muted Misty Mountain heroic and Erebor themes, then Lothlórien, then the Shire.<br /><br />  As the party sets out from Rivendell, we hear the full flowering of the heroic theme as in the originalHobbit trailer from December 2011. I can expect to see some incredibly awesome mountain vistas here, just like in FOTR.<br /><br />19) A Thunder Battle (3:55)<br /><br />  I almost felt like hiding under my bed to escape from the lightning, the rain and the stone-giants. Or maybe I'll just take refuge in this harmless-looking cave right around the corner ....<br /><br />20) Under Hill (1:55)<br /><br />  This is pounding Orc music in 5/4 rhythm. Our friends are taking an unexpected detour.<br /><br />21) Riddles in the Dark (5:21)<br /><br />  \\"What has it got in its pocketses, Precious?\\"<br /><br />  One key musical cue in this track is \\"The History of the Ring\\", which tells us that Bilbo has just found something momentous on the floor of a cave. This innocent happenstance will eventually Change Everything.<br /><br />  Then we hear some familiar jittery, twisted hammer dulcimer music as Bilbo finds himself conversing with a strange creature with a penchant for talking to itself.<br /><br />  The wistful Sméagol theme also puts in an appearance.<br /><br />22) Brass Buttons (7:38)<br /><br />  Bilbo has to squeeze through a tight doorway, and totally trashes his waistcoat.<br /><br />  More jittery music, and more hints of \\"The History of the Ring\\", as Bilbo tries to outfox his new nemesis. Then we hear another dark Polynesian chorus as Bilbo finds a much bigger set of obstacles between himself and daylight.<br /><br />  Later, we hear a bit of Sméagol and then the Dwarf theme.<br /><br />23) Out of the Frying Pan (5:55)<br /><br />  More of that brazen Orc music and Polynesian chorus. Our friends have really got themselves in a tight spot, as this first Hobbit movie draws towards its finale.<br /><br />  And then we get just a hint of the Nature theme -- a boys' chorus -- associated in LOTR with Ents, the Riders of Rohan and giant eagles. Is someone coming to the rescue? The music turns more hopeful.<br /><br />24) A Good Omen (5:47)<br /><br />  Starts with very happy music with another boys' chorus. It gives me the sense of flying, with the potential for more awesome aerial vistas.<br /><br />  The music ends with a sense of dread. This adventure is far from over.<br /><br />25) Song of the Lonely Mountain (4:10)<br /><br />  This is another version of the Dwarven chorus in Track 5, this time sung by New Zealand artist Neil Finn and his two sons, and featuring anvils as percussion. I believe it covers the start of the movie's end credits.<br /><br />  I've heard this one a few times so far, and have trouble getting it out of my head. It's not at all like \\"May it Be\\", \\"Gollum's Song\\" and \\"Into the West\\" in the LOTR trilogy, but it works.<br /><br />26) Dreaming of Bag End (1:49)<br /><br />  Hobbity music as the title might suggest. I would guess this covers the remainder of the end credits. I'm one of those people who will sit through it all, just to soak in the music.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />To me, movie epics like \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and, now, \\"The Hobbit\\" are like giant music videos. I love the way composers like John Williams and Howard Shore weave tapestries of music from basic themes, representing various characters and organizations or even whole civilizations. Howard Shore certainly hasn't lost his touch.<br /><br />Shore reuses musical themes where it is appropriate, and comes up with new themes as needed. We can expect more of the latter as the trilogy unfolds, and new lands and peoples come into play.<br /><br />If this music is any indication, I feel pretty good about the movie. There ought to be plenty of drama. And I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment in December 2013.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I think what these guys do is such a gift! And the joy that they get out of it permeates the music and is infectious! I would highly recommend this album!
B005K17RU0|5.0|doesn't slow down my device, nice graphics, very user friendly layout. Just wish it had better widget selection, and maybe a live wallpaper
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read.  The end is a little harsh but at least it is more plausible than a fairy tale ending.  I really enjoyed the entire series.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Watched Sherlock Holmes as a kid; then my kids watched it when they were kids.  Now Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make it worth watching again.  Fun movie!
B005GSVFAK|5.0|Toy Story 3 is a great movie whether you're 3 or 30. The video quality on both the standard and 3D blu ray is superb and another great one to show off your TV.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I had never read or heard of the Green Lantern until I watched this movie. I found the movie engrossing and fascinating. Although the movie did not follow the comic book story of the origin of the Power Ring (based on my post-movie research) it was still a captivating storyline. I liked Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively as the lead characters. Some of the &#34;superhero&#34; movies have pathetic plots but Green Lantern kept my interest. For once, the main villain was not human but another entity.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love the avengers, Great casting and love going back to my comic days, love how the actors put there own spin on it.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I like the book very much. For the most part it moves along through the volatile and complex life of this very creative genius.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I love how it tells the begining of K  Not so gorey but very nice but short. Managed to tie up loose ends.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|This movie fills in alot of the blanks with the entire Alien story. Very good and enjoyable. Finally understand a little better what was going on. Although it does raise more questions than it answered. Good nonetheless.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|Not a great movie. Too silly to be a serious Sherlock Holmes mystery. Don't waste your money on either of the two Robert Downey, Jr. versions.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Probably the best show on TV in the last 20 yrs. Great story lines and acting. Fantastic show. I would pay to watch this and I did when I missed a few episodes. Ran to Amazon to catch up on this great series. Absolutely love it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read John Grisham's books for years and always enjoy them.  The Racketeer is fun to read as you don't expect what is coming next.  So just get your copy and enjoy the ride.
B0095T3H2U|5.0|It arrived on time, and without damaged. They get a ten out of ten on the scale. Will continue to use them in the future
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is a great love story that I am pretty sure everyone dreams of. This is something I wanted as part of my collection and glad that Amazon had it in stock.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great continuation to the series. The love story between Gideon and Eva is complex and a page turner. I can't wait to read the conclusion in &#34;Entwined in you&#34;.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These two men are extremely talented!.  Their music is truly uplifting and inspiring.  And after you're done listening to their CD, be sure to check out their videos on YouTube.  I wasted an entire day the first time I discovered them, watching all of their videos multiple times because I just couldn't stop myself!  Spectacular videography in some beautiful locations.  I can't recommend this CD enough!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It is a very good book. I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this to people who don't mind a lengthy read and like fiction. It was a very touching book about the way of survival.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys' music is absolutely incredible! How they can turn these songs into something better than the original is beyond me, but they do it.  I pre-ordered the album so I could have it the second it came out; I've listened to it everyday since then.  These guys are really talented and you'll absolutely love their music.  I highly recommend their album... it'll be the best $10 you ever spent. :)
B008K8VDPU|3.0|You can only play 2 notes at a time, no 3-note chords. &#34;keys&#34; are small (on my Kindle Fire) so kind of hard to use, but fun.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This instructional manual is actually pretty good.  Yes, there is a video form of this book, however, it can never hurt to have a paper version of it on the go if one needs a reference.  From start to upload, all is included within the pages of this text.  I recommend having a quick glance at this book before actually attempting to even write a book for kindle.  This can save tremendous amounts of time later on, because one can preformat his or her Word processor document to suit Kindle devices.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love her soulful voice.  It really touches my heart to see someone so young produce music that feels so old.  I look forward to her future endevours.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The entire movie was a joy to watch.  My granddaughters saw the lesson to be learned by the consequences of one's actions.<br />A very good way to teach children to stop and think before doing anything in anger.  The graphics were also great.<br /><br />Dotty Stocky
B008XX6J4C|5.0|One of the bands I'm really happy I found. I'm a cellist myself, and watching Steve play inspires me so much...actually, I found a lot of good friends because of this band :-)
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|While it was already a long movie, I'd still like to see more story line or action in various scenes.  Overall, it was very entertaining.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I live this app and use it on my devices: computer, work tablet, personal tablet (Fire), phone and PC. I've never had problems with it syncing, and find it easy to use. I love being able to type a grocery list from one device and have it with me on my phone. I highly recommend it.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I LOVE this album. I've had X-kid stuck in my head since the album started streaming about a week ago. All three are great but this one is easily my favorite of the three. Definitely recommend picking this one up
B003L77GGK|5.0|If you are not a fan of a little gore this may not be the show for you.  For those of you who love a little spooky in your day though this season continues the Supernatural run of ghouls and ghosties with just enough tongue in cheek comedy to make you truly enjoy finding out what dunnit.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book!  I didn't want to put it down!  Funny and romantic and sweet, I just wish it was a little longer.  The plot may sound like something you've read before but it has a different twist to it that I really enjoyed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Addicting, highly recommend it. I read all 3 in about a week. Anyone could like it, very fast paced and an easy read
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well written, an enjoyable read, my book club selected this book for the month of December.  Thought it would be entertaining yet light and at times funny.  I was not disappointed.
B003B5M0PO|2.0|Was very dissapointed, was kinda short kept and expected more storyline or maybe more detailed specifications.<br />I expected more to be honest :(
B00633W614|5.0|The sins of the Father really draws the reader into the action and makes the reader try to anticipate what comes next. I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy.
B009GESJH2|1.0|Whar garbage.I have a couple of friends that like thiz ignorant dbag rip off artist. They insisted on making me listen to a few songs. I laughed so hard I was crying. I honestly thought they were joking. The lyrics are so unoriginal and cliched. Just completely corny and embarrasingly bad. The music is slick, overproduced generic fluff. Uggh....I was born in and live in Detroit unlike this lying suburbanite. If you want some real Detroit Rock And Roll stick with Jack White...Detroit Cobras...Black Milk...Blanche...The White Stripes...The Racontuers etc. etc....steer clear of this un-original generic mudic for the masses. This moron is as much a rebel as Clay Aiken is.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Good fit does as described glad I purchased it.  Came quickly easy to attach. Satisfied with purchase would recommend to others.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Don't know what it is, but liked this installment way more than the previous two.  Brolin as young K is hilarious and believable.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Another good movie to add to the series, if you liked the first one I think you'll like this one as well.
B007TR1R1I|5.0|Terence Davies has outdone himself. Between the musical score and the sort of gritty, grunge (hard to describe) lighting and film effects used here and there - it set the perfect ambiance for this profound, dark, psychological passion play. Rachel Weisz is exquisite, as always... as she plays this vulnerable role to the hilt, and her co-stars Tom Hiddleston and Simon Russell Beale are nothing short of the perfect counterparts. All of them offer up flawless performances - each fueling the others further and taking their characters deeper and deeper as the story gets more involved. This is a must-see for its stunning performances as well as the beauty of the finished film itself. I truly felt as if I were transported back to post-war Britain. Lovely piece.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game for $.99. It's the best Solitaire game yet. I have several other Solitaire games, but none comes close to this one.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|In great condition. I love owning the cd. Most of the songs are up-beat, and great if you're looking for something to dance to.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like this app. works great on my kindle fire and its great fun .. keeps you busy & lots of fun
1416583408|5.0|I love this book. It shows you the mechanics behind a dog through science without too much annoying jargon. I would recommend it to any dog owner or dog fan.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|My teenaged granddaughter and I loved watching this movie..we all know hard it is to get teen girls to watch anything these days LOL
B001UV4XWY|3.0|Was in good condition. The movie wasn't that great though. Though the seller doesn't have control over that. I read the description, and it sounded good. It wasn't but the shape of the movie was and it's not like they hyped up the story line.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It has many levels that are quite challenging. I have a hard time putting this down!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Fascinating glimpse into the gradual fall of the British aristocracy. I love every minute of it especially the interior shots. Great acting and as smooth of a series as I've seen.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I've liked every release this you lady has put out. She's one of the best at her craft. She will more than likely win a grammy on this one as well.
0307120007|5.0|We went through two of these books when our son was a baby.  It was one of his and his cousins favorite books.  I just had to get one for a great grand daughter.
B0014O1ODS|5.0|This book was a gift for my girlfriend who told me she had lost her copy - and could not find another, I am glad I found it here!
0679809015|5.0|Chunky books are the best!  This is a fun book for a toddler and can take a beating.  Children love to open the doors and see what is inside.  Easy book for young readers to read to small siblings as well.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is really fun. it might not sound that cool but it is really time consuming. there are very little adds so thats good when small kids want to play. you should really get this app
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a great edition of the movie. If you are interested in purchasing Legend, buy the Ultimate Edition! Not only do you get the better known American version with music by Tangerine Dream, you also get the director's cut which includes some footage I had never before seen. A great movie, a great buy!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Lots of great actors in strange character roles, gorgeous set decoration and costumes, hilarious dialogue, all the hallmarks of a great Wes Anderson film. I could watch it over and over.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It will only load the first dozen or so posts, and then will not load any more.  Very buggy on my brand new kindle fire hd 8.9&#34;.....disappointing
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Overall I was entertained with this movie. The cinematography was the best part. Well, Chris Hemsworth, what is not to like.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I thought this film was the right length & cute.  Its storyline captured  a different timeline & different culture was made to be entertaining for all age groups.  Just so easy to download from Amazon video & watch.  Nice to relax on a Sunday afternoon when you have the time.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I just want to know what happens next! I can not wait for the next season to come, wow is it three more months? I am sure it will be worth it. I like the way anything can happen in this story.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Movie is different.  Storyline excellent.  Loved the dog.  Love watching these kind of movies. It was well deserved Oscar.  Everybody should see this movie.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Product arrived on time & functions as described (color & specifications) on the site..<br /><br />would definitely suggest anyone...<br /><br />Feels good while wearing.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Love  every song so does my mom  hope you make number 2 soon<br />great having some of her new songs too
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow wow that all I can say!!! Have to read book number 3 !!!going to buy it right now !!!
B009LRE040|3.0|very slow start got better in the end. not a movie i need to see more than once. wish i did not buy
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie! I bought the digital copy to have on my kindle and ipad so the kids and I could watch wherever we wanted too.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Liked the characters.  Learned a lot about the WW1 era.  Follett brings his characters to life. Recommend to my friends.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|We loved this mini series on youtube and were completely stoked that it was released on DVD and Blu-ray so that we could own it, and watch it whenever we want without having to worry about not being able to find it on the internet when we want to watch it a few years down the road.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great story and very quick read. Liked the short chapters, realistic dialogue and characters. Highly recommend it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|this was a good purchse, no problems what so ever. It was a gift for a friend and he loves it.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|the kids and the adults all liked this one. story was a bit predictable but its based on a classic fairy tale.
0345529057|5.0|I love the show so I just had to buy the books and I love the books even more. It has been a long time since I have read a novel series since I've been unable to find a series that I'm interested in. I flew through one novel now on my second  and of course I will reread since the devils in the details!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What's not to love? These guys bring a fun-ness to the music. I have been a fan of Jon Schmidt for about 10 years and teaming up with the Piano Guys has just made everything better! People of all ages and interests will love this music! Just get it. You won't regret it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Every song is absolutely amazing!!!! The songs are beautiful and I literally have listened to every song at least fifty times by now.  I would recommend this cd to any music lover!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is a good read for almost anyone. It is imaginative and still realistic, somber and still inspiring. Salaam.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I love this book. I've read it to all my kids. This is a book I could read over and over again
B000Q3648S|1.0|The inside cd holder was shattered in one of the sides. The cd fell out and the inside looks very ugly from the scratches of the shattered plastic. The music is amazing, but to pay 25 dollars for a malfunctioned case was a huge let down. I bought the cd for aesthetic purposes, but was left disappointed.
B000068FWC|5.0|It has not been opened as yet as it's a christmas gift, it came un-opened, new in package and was shipped very fast. I know the recipient is going to be thrilled with it.  I love this album from fellow countrymen of mine,  it brings back so many good memories for me.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The picture was really done well and the special effects were great.  Had a  lot of stars in it also.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are great!  This is one of my all time favorite albums I have.  These guys put their own twist on songs, and put a video with it that actually goes along with the music.  The music and the videography are amazing.  If you haven't listed to them yet, check out their youtube channel.  You won't be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think this is a good game for little kids and it helps your child grow<br />in education and imagination plus it will save you time
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This is such a creative and fun game to play with a group of people of all ages! My nephew loves playing this game and I like how there are 3 levels to choose from.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is great love it cant stop playing can you make a game that is of our time with the latest weapons like tanks armored cars battle ships etc. thanks for the cool free game
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Great on HD....Love Robert Downey Jr....<br />Special Effects were good especially in HD and large screen at home.  Love Amazon
B007SGLZP8|3.0|&#34;The Racketeer&#34; has a so-so plot that borders on the ridculous.  Definitely not one of Grisham's best.  I would recommend he stay with the nlegal world and stay out of organized crime.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I bought a much less powerful battery pack charger a couple of years ago...the older version (not an Anker) would barely charge a full battery, and over time it did not hold a charge at all.  It was only good for about a year.<br /><br />This batter is much more powerful - charges fast, and charges my cell phone even faster.  Fully Satisfied.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I purchased this CD and it is now one of my favorites. Sometimes I listen to it in the car instead of my XM radio station. I love the songs because they are just the right mix of classical and contemporary elements mixed together in each of the tracks. If you are thinking about purchasing it, then stop thinking and add it to the cart now. You will be very happy that you did.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Instrumental and lyrical density, in the best tradition of Rush, but somehow this album hits me on an emotional level more than their other albums (I'm a Rush fan since 1979).  It's hard for me not to listen to \\"The Wreckers\\" without closing my eyes and just...being there on a ship during a storm, moments away from hitting the rocks and being subjected to the marauding hordes on shore.  It's hard for me not to listen to the title track without actually looking upward and trying to spot the angels.  It's hard for me not to listen to \\"Wish Them Well\\" and forgive a certain person who caused me more than a bit of grief not too long ago.<br /><br />I could go on in the same vein for each of the other songs, but will spare you.  Suffice it to say that this is among the very best Rush albums.  The only way to say whether an album is *the* greatest is with the hindsight of time, but I believe that in just a few years, this will be considered a classic, essential Rush album.  Yes, it is that good.<br /><br />The older these guys get, the better they get...I do not know how they do it.  Neil is his usual otherwordly self on drums; Alex's guitar is on fire, and so are his fingers; Geddy's bass playing leaves me slack-jawed, probably because I'm a bass player myself and he makes me (and everyone else) look stoopid!  Each of the guys gets multiple chances to solo, riff, and just plain rock out with the others.  More than anything, Rush makes me smile.  What a great band!<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying this album, just do it.  Consider it an impulse buy...I don't care, just buy it, I implore you.  Listen on auto-repeat, with headphones, until it sinks in.  It'll take a while, but believe me, it's more than worth it.
B0098460O4|4.0|Well, I saw a performance on youtube and was impressed enough to by a whole CD and was not disappointed. I don't think you will either. Pop and Opera music combined from two people who seem to genuinely love to sing.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|It was a little different from what I expected but I am enjoying it none the less.  Can't wait for his new album.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I liked this movie, not as good as the 2nd but still a great film. My only wish is that Blu-rays like this would offer the itunes copy too. not just ultraviolent.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love it.  My son was counting down the days until this came out.  He's played it daily ever since it came out.
B008G59IKO|5.0|Green Day's second album in the trilogy and its fantastic I got the CD in great condition and I listen to it alll the time.
B000002MP2|5.0|Classic old school album.  I think its better than new stuff, but either way I recommend.  Quick Shipping and arrival right on time.  Thanks again for the great music.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Would have given five stars, but the volume crescendo function does not work for me when launching Pandora as the alarm. Otherwise excellent app that I use as my daily, primary alarm.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Loved how they pulled all the different Marvel comic characters together into one movie.  It was a fun, action romp.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I love it its easy to work whit it and its amazing or I like the way it is and that it show me the information
B007SSDS24|3.0|This movie didn't have much more to it's plot than it's preview showed, and the scenes shown in the trailer were the majority of the intense scenes in the movie.  It was a good story and well acted, but it just seemed like it needed a little more depth/intensity to it's plot.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I love the way I can do what I like the way that just turning on one button and then everything star
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The first Expendables movie was interesting to see all the past action hero's come together and poke a little fun at themselves. But this just turned into a total farce and these guys are either not good enough actors to carry off the comedic aspect or were embarrassed and just not trying.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|I just love how it works its amazing idont make any trouble using it and its just simple and I love it and I recommend
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is a great read and a must read for us Bosch fans.  I've been on the hunt with Harry Bosch since picking up The Black Echo 20 some years ago.  Michael Connelly is one of the greatest US crime writers of our era and, I don't think it's to much of a stretch to say, maybe any era.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love it just sometimes I wish to don't need to have my computerer on for use this but its amazing how it works
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always enjoy Grisham books. Wish he could write faster. One of my favorites is Skipping Christmas. Buy this one, it is funny.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game has plenty to do that is free!  I just wish the details of play were clearer.  More info about how to earn extra coins, benefits of making friends, etc.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Such brave young men. I was fasinated by all they have to train for and how very hard thier missions are. These guys are the best. The book was an easy read, could not put it down, will read it again one day.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I didn't get what this was all about. It was an OK mystery (how did the girl get off the island?) but by the end, you don't have many options. Musta been smuggled out by someone. Huh. And the rest of it was interesting about Sweden with little literary bits of color and scenery. But over all, would a ward of the state really do something like that to her overlord (or whatever)? Maybe I'm in a mood but I expected a more compact story. I guess it meandered too much for me.
B004JK61K0|5.0|I have an older Android v2.2 phone and the default email client was always sub-standard and lacked configuration options.  It often got confused because my 3G didn't connect fast enough.  Instead of re-trying a connection it would freeze and I'd have to kill the email app.<br /><br />K-9 Mail addressed all of my complaints with the default generic email client on my phone.  K-9 is thoroughly configurable, it never freezes even if 3G hasn't kicked in, and it has nice features built-in like IMAP settings for GMail so I don't need to run multiple mail apps.  Highly recommended!
B000JZ3TYA|1.0|This movie was very slow and very difficult to understand the actual plot. I fell asleep within the first half hour of the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show on TV. That's all I can say,Watch it and Love it or your brains are only good for a light snack.
B0012HQKZE|4.0|How Alec Baldwin constantly had a supply of dry mini cigars and then cigarettes as well as matches is a mysety to me.<br />Lighting huge fires in the wilderness elements just isn't that easy.<br /><br />Bear scenes were great though.
B0009UC810|5.0|Gone with the Wind, Singing in the Rain, Casablanca... The Blues Brothers. And indeed, this fun film is a class, at least IMHO. It's one of those movies I can watch over & over- or at least fast-forward until I get to my favorite scenes.<br /><br />Great music, great acting, great lines, action, cameos...what more could one ask?<br /><br />Mrs. Tarantino: Are you the police?<br />Elwood: No, ma'am. We're musicians.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This must be THE BEST &quot;Tap to Walk&quot; Adventure Game for Android.<br />The story is nice and intriguing,the graphics are a great mix of real life and fantasy...<br />IT'S AN AMAZING ADVENTURE, you really find yourself wanting to figure out more... i started playing it while i was in bed ready to go sleep... later on i realized it was past 3am and i was still playing it.<br />No need for Walktrough, the game has the perfect amount of Difficulties and Clues on how to solve,them... yes, it took me some hours to figure out some stuff, but this game is so nice that,is also good to go just take a virtual walk.<br />TOTALLY LOVED IT<br />I wish it would have lasted even longer, but i look forward for another Game of this kind by this Developer<br /><br />DEFINITELY I RACCOMMAND IT TO EVERYBODY
B003VIWO9I|5.0|The tale of the cunning man the witch and the hare, classic Pratchett to weave folklore, fear and funny together.
B004UPANAI|4.0|I am a big fan.  Enjoyed it, especially for such a great price. The storyline easily followed and the action kept me interested.
B009VB97EY|4.0|the plot isn't all that great, but who buys magic mike for the plot? its worth it even with no plot.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I know he says his mount her had him tested, but he is. These folks are solo funny. Starting watching it because I was bored, now I just purchased seasons 1-5 lol.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|app won't open on my android phone, get Sorry! message saying it stopped unexpectedly. If I don't get a reply from the developer I'll have to delete it.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This reminds me of my childhood. &#34;Transformers, more than meets the eye...&#34;  This keeps me young. Loving this. Some people may say don't make another, but I hope they do.
B004I744AS|5.0|I was so excited to find a free dictionary to use when doing crossword puzzles.  I can type in a word or phrase and it is so helpful.  Love it!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I downloaded this through my computer - it said it would be available on the library on my kindle.  I checked - it wasn't there.  So I tried to download it through my Kindle.  My Kindle says, \\"this has already been downloaded, check your library\\".  I check the library again, not there.<br /><br />There's not obvious way for me to \\"cancel\\" the computer-initiated download that obviously failed.  I really am regretting getting my Kindle Fire.  :-/
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Enjoyed the series, enjoy being able to pick it up and have it not only be higher quality, but at a more reasonable price. Can't wait until the other series are out on Bluray!
0194325385|5.0|There are many explanations about thousands of words, and how they should be used in order to make sense, whether with a verb, or with a substantive, adjective, etc., and a great and easy to use CD.<br />I strongly recommend it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's got a cult following, which grew to a popular culture following. It's space. I like space. Makes this one shiny collection, don'tcha think?
1594744769|4.0|I've really gotten lucky the last couple books I've read.  They've been quite original and that's hard to find in fiction books these days.  For me this book started out kind of slow but it's all required information needed to make the whole story make sence.  The story revolves around Jacob, his relationship with his grandpa and the journey he goes on to finally understand his grandpa and all the fantastic stories he told.  The pictures included in the book absolutely add a creepy factor to the story that I loved and I can't wait to read the sequel.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Bear McCreary did an excellent job taking over for Richard Gibbs who scored the Miniseries. McCreary's take on the Battlestar Galactica Universe was rich and full of character.  The soundtrack is mixed with low-synth percussion action tracks, a beautiful opera, muzak, and string orchestral to convey the feeling of a scene. I loved the use of drums in this soundtrack portraying a sense of action and slow-pace.<br /><br />I liked that there were no real bombastic score for the first season, as the first is just a continuation of the haunting pose set by the miniseries as humanity tries to out run the Cylons in their quest to rid the universe of humanity.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third and final Hunger Games book was riveting to the very end. I know it had to end, but I really wish the series would continue on forever!
0385338686|5.0|My other half loved the characters introduced in the Sophie Kinsella series and wanted to read everything she had ever written.  She read this particular book within a day and was disappointed that she had finished it so soon.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|absolutely no one is better than the black keys. i have recently discovered them for myself even though i have a friend who  has talked about them for some time. man, was i missing out on so much! great bad, great CD
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business REALLY Got my husband moving!! Loved it
B0038BBA4I|5.0|i asked myself &#34;where have i been living this whole time that i am just now discovering the awesomeness that is mumford & sons???&#34;
B008JAGG38|5.0|I always loved the American Pie series, but I was unsure because sequels never do so well, but this was impressive lol.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE LOVR LOVE The Piano Guys!! And I'm not the only one. My baby loved them in the womb, and still does out of the womb a year later. My husband is a huge fan too. They're brilliant and so creative! Buy this album! You won't regret it!! :)
B0090EHVMC|5.0|For never reading the Lorax as a child I enjoyed the movie. It provided a good lesson. Heartwarming and family oriented.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Purchased Battle Born the day it was released.  Has a different flavor from past albums and I LOVE IT.  Saw them in concert two weeks ago.  The energy from Brandon, Ronnie, Dave and Mark was incredible!  The play list mixed new and old, and I would see them tomorrow if I could!  I love every song on this album.  WELL DONE, KILLERS.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The first book in this series was wonderful and I would read it again.I recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have followed The Piano Guys for some time... They are entertaining and their music is fantastic.  Had attended several piano concerts when it was just John playing the piano.  He is witty, funny and incredibly talented!  Now with all the guys talent coming together, LOVE their arrangements and songs!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing. Their youtube videos are always awesome, and the music is always more awesome. Can't miss with these guys.
1439152802|4.0|The more I read this book, the more I liked it. Kate Morton crafted an excellent tale, building it gradually as she included pieces from 2011, 1941 and even earlier. The characters and the story line come together with surprises that feel &#34;right.&#34; I'm glad I read it and will recommend it to my book group.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Great movie, but extra special on blu ray!!!  Thanks ...incredible sound quality, too. Just a fun movie, good to watch over ...and over
B007V2UGPE|2.0|The game is a side-scrolling hack-and-slash. It is repetitive and I did not find it very engaging. Your only options are moving right or left, and using a special ability. The attacks are automatic, you cannot jump, duck, or block.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this book twice and will probably read it again! Don't judge a book by its movie...although the movie is quite good as well.
B0026145WK|5.0|I love Daniel Craig, and this is yet another example of his acting ability, his versatility.  It's full of love, action, intrigue and grief.  I cannot wait to see the second one when it hits DVD sometime around January 15th! :)
1419705849|5.0|Both of my boys have read all the books in this series and love them.  It's humor that they get and they said it has good details.
B00338QENI|5.0|Page turner.  Uniquely woven story of a poor black family and a medical institution's treatment of African Americans in the 50's. Skloot's telling of this family's history and Ms. Lacks' contribution to cell research is remarkably informative and well written.  One of the best books I've ever read..
0671449028|5.0|Love all of Sandra Boynton's books and this is no different.  I love getting her books as baby shower presents... they are never a disapointment.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Recommend this album for people who like Avett Brothers and Dylan type music.  Very good first album...looking forward to seeing them live this week!
0525478817|5.0|I *LOVED* Looking For Alaska and before The Fault in Our Stars none of the more recent John Green's quite measured up (though they are all great) but this... this is John Green at his best.  What I love most about John Green is the beauty, cadence, rhythm of his write.  I love to read his novels aloud. They ready like finely written verse.  Add in his ability to bring wit, humor, and charm to a book that on the surface seems like it would be entirely depressing and in my opinion this book highly deserves every award its won.  Well done John Green.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Terrible errors can't evev draw or guess the drawing of your friend. app crashes before I can even try to hit go for the next round.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|For me this is like a new classic film.  I was skeptical about the cast but I left the theater impressed and wanting to watch it again and again.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Great show, unfortunately missed the first two episodes so downloaded them from Amazon in HD, excellent price works great on my iPad!
B0041D843M|5.0|&#34;The China Study&#34; has proven to be an excellent guide and welcome addition to our library.  We have taken it to heart in our kitchen (pun intended).
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have such an amazing talent in writing music, modifying music and doing fun and amazing videography!  My family LOVES their music, in fact because of The Piano Guys, in no small part, my kids are highly motivated to learn to play music on their instruments of choice.  Keep up the great work!  I tell people about The Piano Guys every where I go.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These over the head are light and don't fall out like earbuds.  Bass could be better but what can you expect.  Price is great!
B009FZFONO|5.0|great! now I love zombies! Great show with lots of twists and turns.  Some stuff a little ridiculous...like the girl having a different outfit on in every scene at the end of civilization but overall great!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Once in a while someone writes a great book and every aspect comes together in this one. i can't remember reading a better book.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I just opened this CD and it does NOT contain \\"Fade Into You\\" as the sticker on the front of the CD indicates.  I purchased this CD specifically for this song.  The other 2 song listed on the sticker are on the CD.  Was it pulled last minute?  Why?  So many viewers of \\"Nashvolle\\" are in love with this specific song and, given how it was presented on the show, it \\"ties\\" the cast together.  Watch the clip and, shame on whoever left it off this CD!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a really cool game. A great way to unwind at the end of the day, and you don't even have to feel guilty as it is like a mini workout for the brain.
0451232577|5.0|Ken Follett is a tremendous writer, and you won't be disappointed with his latest installment. His story lines are gripping, and his characters are outstanding. Highly recommended if your looking for a great book that will have you begging for more at the end of each page.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Here are the good points about the game:<br />The colors are vibrant and the graphics are very well done. It's very cute and colorful. There is always a goal to work toward, so it doesn't get boring too fast. The mini-games are fun, and the developers were strategic in allowing you limited amount of times to play the games. You can only play when your ponies are ready to play them, so each time you get to play, you look forward to it and try to do your best. And here is a point that could be seen as good or bad depending on the person: the further you progress in the game, the longer it takes to build and purchase stuff. But fortunately, the game seems to progress even as you are not playing. So while I am waiting for the next thing to do in the game, I can go do other activities so that I am not just constantly playing this game while neglecting everything else. Then I can come back and get back into it. I like that.<br /><br />The bad points:<br />I really like the game, but it is hard to enjoy because it is always crashing. The game just closes itself on my kindle for no apparent reason. Also, the same darn ad comes up in the beginning for Monster Life or whatever. It's a big ad that takes up almost the whole screen, and it freezes your whole game when it shows up. For it to do this once is enough, but it does it every single time I open the game. Little ads at the bottom of the screen that don't interrupt your game are okay, but this one is big, and it has to show up every time you open the game before it lets you play. Isn't it enough to the developer that I am already playing one of their games? Yet they feel the need to interrupt with a huge ad every time. I deducted a star because of these annoyances. Otherwise, if you are an MLP fan, you will love this game.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered this cable for my 4th gen Kindle. I Love that the cord is longer than my phone's charging cord, making it easier for me to read with comfort while the kindle charges. I also love that it is a USB cord making it versatile, I can plug it into anything that has the USB port! I would recommend this to anyone with a Kindle who needs/wants an extra cable.
B005FISBTO|4.0|This show is awesome. If your looking for a show with the great combination of Law and Order and something a bit more gory, this is it. Truly one of the great shows on television.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I love batman so when I saw it in the app store I got it.it turns out I don't have enough space now I'm kind of hummed but I have a kindle fire.I deleted all of my games to get it.so check product info before you try to get it

B009FZHYKU|3.0|Since I have never read the books, I am sure, I do not understand everything, The group is almost gone, so move on. need new story line.
0345529057|4.0|What a terrific series! Truly enjoyed reading it before catching up with the HBO series. George Martin is a terrific storyteller and these books truly offer something for everyone. A great read that would make a great gift!
1419705849|1.0|say too much because it was of course for my kid. seems like all the kinds of books disrespectful to adults but whats new? he was happy but burned through it in no time at least he's reading at a very high level:)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was longer than expected. Author should have said why he could not commit easily instead of waiting almost until the third of book.<br />She was good though, would read again.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|This game is soooo painfully slow, I just - can't - play it any more! Seriously, every time I click on an item to pick it up, someone has to tell me the story of their life, or worst, that chick keeps flirting with me! Where is the option to tell the girl, \\"Listen, you are cute, but we are about to die, so how about you stop teasing me with your 7th grader school ground flirtations until after the bad man stops trying to kill us!?\\" Check the facet, \\"Oh Jumpy, want to shower with me?\\" Anything on the night stand, \\"remember when we were kids? Do you like me?\\" What's that by the bed, \\"SLEEP WITH ME! Just kidding, you pervert!\\"<br /><br />It's like all the crap personalities from Saw, with none of the relief of the brutal murders! And this at only about two puzzles in (however, easily two hour of crap dialog) - does it get any better? I've tried to play it for the last month, on and off. I tried it sober, I tried it drunk, I tried it whilst slamming my head into a tree trunk.<br /><br />The graphics are fantastic, the story premiss is interesting, I love point and click games (a la Deja Vu and Shadow Gate), and this is one of those, but I can't stand this formula of 10 paragraphs for every one action. Pickup an item, pages of dialog that are unrelated, move to a room, 10 pages of dialog that aren't related. And worst so, it's dialog you'd find only in tween love dramas. Good luck! I give up. Time to burn the evidence.
044022425X|5.0|I love the Outlander series and was pleased to see the inclusion of the Mohawks as part of the story. The main problem is, however, that the Jesuits were out of New York by the late 1680's when England declared the region to be under English control and they threatened to execute any Jesuits found in the area (accurately fearing them to be spies for France). Most of the Mohawks relocated to Canada where one of their own, Kateri, was to become the first Native American saint honoured just a few weeks ago in 2012. The ones who remained in New York became Anglican when the most western church at the time, Queen Anne's Chapel, was built west of Albany in 1713 after four Mohawk chiefs went to England, swore their loyalty to the queen and received promises of a church, a minister and a silver communion set that is still used to this day. The inclusion of the longhouse, the Jesuit and the Mohawk culture, however is done very nicely and accurately sensitive even though it is 100 years out of time. The relocation of the Tuscaroras to the New York vicinity also occurred in 1720, long before it is in the series. By 1770, the Mohawk Valley had 300 Mohawks surrounded by 3,000 settlers, and they lived in log houses not longhouses. These Mohawks fled NY to Canada with the British when war broke out and the warriors from Fort Hunter did participate in the action at Fort Ticonderoga and afterwards under the leadership of Joseph Brant's cousin, John Deserontyon (An Echo in the Bone). After the war, Brant established two reserves for the warriors. Deserontyon's followers, 104 of them, relocated to one of the reserves and today the band list contains over 8,000 qualified descendants. There are 5 other Mohawk reserves also in Canada. The Tuscarora live in both Canada and on a reserve near Niagara Falls, NY. I think the Drums of Autumn and the other books in the series do an honour to these groups, even though out of sequence with reality, but still done with respect to their plight.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|All star cast and funny at times.  But also very predictable at times.  I have to admit I was a little disappointed but still happy we watched it.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|I had only heard one song by this band but Amazon had a $1.99 sale on albums for Cyber Monday week so I decided why not? I was pleasantly surprised. The lead singer reminds me of almost a Janis Joplin type with some good solid soul in her voice. This is a very good solid album. Especially considering most of the mainstream garbage that get rammed down our throats over the airwaves. It is refreshing to hear some genuine musicians putting some passion back into music.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Book is really living up to my expectations. I was concerned about potential quality as the author has been putting books out at a much faster pace.
B00138KCC4|5.0|Had this album when it came out almost 20 years ago. It is a classic and still very much relates to today's current events. It doesn't gets old.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I'm a huge fan of this series, but this one is not up to par.  Connelly seems to be running short of ideas as to what to do with Harry.  The book sputters to an awkward and unconvincing conclusion, in which Harry's rescue from certain death occurs by way of the improbable and hugely coincidental arrival of a character who had been set up as his nemesis.  In the final pages, Bosch gleefully relishes the villain being turned into a quadriplegic in a violent accident, a response which leaves a bad taste.
B003E20ZQA|5.0|I loved this book, Patti writes her story as beautifully as she wrote her poems and songs, she never holds back it really is warts and all. Reading just kids made me hungry for more information on both Smith herself and her constant companion Mapplethrop. It's a book I know I will re-read each time appreciating it on a new level.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I introduced their music to my mom. She loves them just as much as I do! I first heard them on youtube and was hooked. Now I'm taking Cello lessons. I blame it on the Starwars video they did.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked this book. Certain parts dragged on a little too long, and there were a couple of times I thought the behavior of Travis was a bit excessive, but overall it was a great book.  I would recommend to friends/family.
B00005JKYI|5.0|who doesnt love kevin bacon? this movie is a classic if you havent seen it now is the time! awesome movie
B0012GMXBK|5.0|Love this offering from the boys in Accept, excellent song writing and killer guitar and who can forget the vocals of the great Udo
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really like reading anything Vince Flynn writes, and &#34;The Last Man&#34; is no exception.  It is obvious there is room for a sequel to this thriller, and I await with bated breath for its release.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Hope Springs is an Incredabilly griping story. Movie was great and there couldn't have been better actors that played the roles. Jones and Steep were at there best!
B003KGBISY|5.0|ok. it's not the only samurai movie you should ever watch but it's defiantly one of the top films about samurai in my opinion.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the PianoGuys! They have so much talent and bring instrumental music to a whole new level. They are AMAZING!!!
B004GVUPFE|4.0|It's a fun logic puzzle--you try and move the blocks around to get the correct shape into the highlighted area in the fewest moves possible.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is nice being able to pick your game - choices are random, winning or against someone.  No complaints here!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really like this game, but every time I update it the more the game freezes on me. At this point I cannot play the game while traveling. I get thrown out of the game each time I try, whereas before I could play where ever, when ever. Now I need to have wifi to be able to play which is really annoying. Its a disadvantage for me as I play my games more while traveling to pass the time. I still get thrown out of the game while playing even with wifi. I hope these issues can be resolved soon or I will delete this game.
0345803493|5.0|I have read many romantic novels, but this one seemed so well thought out and enjoyable.  I can't understand why I'm so affected by Fifty Shades.  The sex was good, but sort of redundant in  descriptions.  I guess there are not enough words in the English language cover all the feelings and emotions of desire.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I haven't really read any Steven King books so I thought I'd try this short story. Loved it! Each chapter is a different person but makes the story easy to read. Now I'll have to check out his novels.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is actually my 6th time watching this movie, it's that great.  This is coming from a DC Comics fan tho, so...
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Faotd can't pass trying thouse out. Not the best but will work for killing a few min. Glad it was free.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This movie was pretty good.  There was action and excitement everywhere.  So much so that I forgot I don't care for Tom Cruise very much.  Enjoy!
B003K16P3M|4.0|A great read and finally a YA book that has some length to it. Most novels seem to end too quickly but this story kept me captivated from page one to the end.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is the best original tv series in a long time that everyone in the family can be entertained.  I watched season 1 marathon style and had to catch up to the current season.  I love how all of my favorite and not so favorite characters pop up.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This was sent as areplacement for the original which did not work with  my knidle, well the replacement also does not work , So now I have 2 USB power chords that DO NOT WORK..I am charging with the wall charger for my Wife's Kindle Fire.. DO NOT BUY THIS
1932735410|2.0|I started preparing for the PMP exam in Sept 2012 and used Rita's 7th edition to start with.  She has missed several aspects and are promoting their own processes.  After passing the PMP in Dec on the first try, if I had used Rita as a sole source, the i was guaranteed to have failed. There is a perception that Rita is the only way you can pass.  I can surely say that is a false message.<br /><br />Strategy is to use this as a initial starting point and focus on the PMBOK; the reading is fairly straightforward.<br /><br />The exam is really tough and I do not recommend any one using PMP Prep as a basis for preparing.  Farnedale is closer to the exam and does a great job in level setting the knowledge.<br /><br />The book lacks a key aspect which is how each process areas flow into each other and the interactions.  This is covered by PMBOK and i felt this was a real negative.  Rita needs to stick with what is authorised methology vs trying to create her own.<br /><br />Frankly, there are tonnes of folks selling courses and materials; each is trying to make a lot of money from students.  This is also one of those.  Avoid PMPFastrack software, in my humble opinion it is overrated and extremely expensive and not worth the grain it is being premiumed for.  PMZilla site has good support of short notes and additional material key to succeeding.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This ap works flawlessly for me and always provides the weather information I want.  I would highly recommend it to anyone interested.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|People claim that they were fooled into thinking this was a live action movie.  This is a completely baseless accusation.  It amazes me the lengths people will go to blame anyone but themselves for their mistakes.  All the information is on the page.  Do the people who were fooled read?  The director is not Chris Nolan, the actor is not Christian Bale, and the format says animated.  Where is the disconnect here?<br /><br />Anyways, the movie was excellent, and it was a good adaptation of the comic book.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I have just gotten used to a story being laid out beginning - middle - end that i really struggled with chapter one. I was a little upset that the story just stopped mid chapter and started the next chapter on a dime and left gaping questions unanswered. Once you get past the first chapter you sort of get used to the writers style and start enjoying the book. Each chapter is written a little bit differently than the last and you have to adjust to the style and cadence to really enjoy the story. Once you get used to the different styles and the story fragments start piecing themselves together you find yourself really enjoying the book.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is the best app ever. very entertaining. my only wish is they updated the puzzles more often. highly recommend
B0014H32MG|5.0|To be honest i didn't even know &#34;The running man&#34; early 90's film was based off a book until it came on TV the other day and i watched the opening credits. I told myself it was definitely something i needed to check out. The book is fairly short for a Stephen King book but of course it was written as his alter ego Richard Bachman. Don't expect the book to be anything like the movie with the exception of the characters names. Ben Richards is more of an anti-hero in the book but you can't help but find yourself root for him anyways.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|I really loved the first Ghost Rider, but Ghost Rider: Spirit f Vengeance is a disappointment. It is so far from the original storyline. In the first movie, Johnny Blaze made his deal with the devil by pricking his finger by accident, but according to the sequel, he cut his hand on a broken bottle. The appearance of the rider is different as well. In the first movie, the skull was white, he worn a jacket with spikes, and hs chain wrapped around him. He was out for justice, but not \\"HUNGER\\" or ANGER. His motorcycle was totally different and sleeker as well as a little scary, but in the second, not as menancing as the first one. His  Penatence Stare suddenly has become an angry hunger. The rider was created for justice, not revenge. The write of the second film must not have seen the first part or completely disregarded what was in the movie. If there is a #3, I hope they do a better job!
B00849CADE|5.0|No se como clasificar este libro, sencillamente ES. Allende describe el país en que vivió, en el que actualmente reside y el que encontró a su regreso al Chile de sus amores. Desde mi país, vemos a Chile como progresista, gran exportador, orgulloso y autónomo. Desde el año en que se publicó este libro al día de hoy, ha avanzado hasta alcanzar niveles jamás vistos en Latinoamérica. Para empezar una mujer presidente, este hecho contradice lo dicho por I. Allende. Era uno de los pocos de esta autora que no había leído. Su prosa sigue siendo vigorosa e interesante. Estoy deseando que publique uno nuevo, pues su última novela, El cuaderno de Maya lo he leído 3 veces!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This was simply a potboiler from Grisham.  Illogical plot twists never fully explained.  Things didn't flow logically.  It was almost as if Grisham selected 10 words from the dictionary every day and set himself the goal of making sure they were woven into story. Always anxiously await a book from this author.  This one was not worth the wait.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to share recipes.  Everyone I know that uses Pinterest finds is helpful and fun and it has so many different things on it.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This was so far below DeMille's standards.  it was a potboiler of the worst kind.  Yuck.  John Corey behaves like a smart-ass, petulant junior high twit who somehow in a paragraph or two manages to &#34;dispatch the bad guy&#34;.  It was absolute drivel.  Don't waste your money buying The Panther.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I found this book helpful and already lost 5 Lb in the last 2 weeks.  I am a diabetic and use a insulin pump.  By cutting down on Carbs I have reduced my insulin use.  I have been trying to lose weight for several years this is most encouraging. ----------------- RICH
B002RI9UBS|5.0|COULD NOT STOP READING THIS THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE STORY AND WILL MAKE A GREAT MOVIE AND HOPE IT IS AS GOOD.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I think this app is great but your deskription says that uou have the new hoth episodebut you havent. Pleas do so. Thanks
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I actually know these people - thanks to the incredible skills of the author who brought them all to life!  I don't suppose it was right of me to be chuckling through most of the Hawaii section but the dialog is so wonderful, just couldn't help it.  It is really a serious forward and backward look at our screwed up world and if it all comes true, well, we were warned.  Thank you David Mitchell!
0525953728|5.0|Good take on the day to day life of a Seal.<br />These men are the best of the best for our nation.<br />I felt as if i was there with him and his crew.<br />I did recommend it to one other person and she enjoyed it also.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot as it made me laugh and lifted my spirits.<br />It was a littl over the top as far as stimulation went, something happening<br />with sound and action every moment just about...but the whole generational<br />Santa thing was insightful and fun and slightly dysfunctional and challanging,<br />which made it easy to relate to. And ARthur, with the heart of gold and the faith<br />of a child really shone through and inspired the Santa in each of us. And one<br />more thing, the Scottich accent was dimensionally awesome and brought a lot<br />of character to everyone! Thanks! and Merry Christmas to all!
0062082353|5.0|Very informative. Placing one in the battle itself.<br />I personally felt the cursing should have been left out.<br />I understand that is how G.I.s talk i was one many years ago.<br />I thank Chris Kyle for his service very much.<br />He and all the other service men and women who have and are serving our country are true heros.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that can handle the bad language.
B0098VXE50|3.0|I enjoyed watching the film.  I liked the edgy side of this fairy tale.  It is told much more in a Grimm fashion instead of the gooey, Disney fashion.  I like that Snow White had to fight the witch/queen.  I liked the Huntsman and William and how only the one who had won her heart made her wake up.  There will be some who may disagree on who that should have been!!!!  There was one thing left decidedly undone.  I believe on purpose, but because I like films to have all things decided and final at the end it lacked the romance for me that I thought would have been nice since this is a fairy tale after all.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man<br />I thougt it was a great book...I would definitely recommend it to anyone that likes this type of subject matter.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, after amazon rental I will be sure to go out and buy it on blu-ray
B00632HWOG|1.0|Too intrusive. Wants to know everything on my phone, even things it has no business knowing. I won't use it.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I love this movie and I love Ryan Reynolds! My son thinks it is an awesome movie too, so I can't wait to see his face when he gets it on Christmas!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|So how do you follow up to a debut album that had nearly half the songs released as singles, two of which \\"Grenade\\" and \\"Just the Way You Are\\" hitting #1?<br /><br />Upon first hearing \\"Locked out of Heaven\\" and then seeing the album cover featuring a Gorilla in front of a jukebox, I was very worried that the pressure put on Bruno was all too much...  That is until I listened to the entire cd (steamed on his website) and then realized the brilliance of it all.<br /><br />Unorthodox Jukebox is as Bruno mentioned in a recent interview, \\"taking all I've learned in the past two years and pushing myself lyrically, musically, and having fun creatively...\\" The result -  10 track collection that crosses many genres and styles appealing to the widest possible fan-base. If you want old-school, listen to \\"If I Knew.\\" Reggae, \\"Show Me\\", 80s dance music reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean, \\"Moonshine\\" and power ballads like \\"Talking to the Moon\\", hear \\"When I was Your Man\\" (already slated as the next proper single) \\"Young Girls\\" and \\"Natalie\\" are sure to be future classics and show Bruno at his finest, delivering upbeat pop songs with extremely catchy hooks....<br /><br />I strongly recommend purchasing the DELUXE EXCLUSIVE EDITION (which sadly is available only from another U.S. retailer) as it includes an additional 5 tracks, which give you a more complete picture behind the making of this album.<br /><br />Track 11 features a debut with Esperanza Spalding called, \\"Old and Crazy\\", Tracks 12-13 are the original demo versions (vocal and guitar) to \\"Gorilla\\" and \\"Young Girls\\" while tracks 14-15 are two excellent remixes: the bass-driven remix of \\"Moonshine\\" by the Futuristics and a reggae infused mix by Diplo of \\"Locked Out of Heaven.\\"
B001AXU1CS|5.0|My 17 year old daughter loves this movie, so when I found this edition at such an awesome price I just had to buy it for her for Christmas!
B008CP93S0|1.0|Too raunchy for my taste.  Would not reccommend this movie.  Still like Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd though - just not my cup of tea.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I watched the 1st episode on Netflix and was looking to catch up on the 2nd one (the episodes that were already screened).  5 episodes into the 2nd season, they have managed to maintain the suspesne and drama.  To see if they can continue.  Needless to say the Amazon ordering process was seamless - from click to watch in a few seconds.  However, the quality of the picture with Netflix seemed to be better.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I really love Mitch Rapp & the character he portrays. He is tough, mean & no nonsense but gentle & respectable.  I love that he kills for the benefit of the country that he & I love, the USA. My son, a Marine got me into reading this seris.  He & I agree with Mitch Rapp's  attitudes & practices.

B00A2H9L2E|3.0|When the original Silent Hill movie was released, I was more than a little bit skeptical. I mean, how could you possibly capture the relentlessy terrifying atmosphere of the games and transfer it successfully over to film? Fair enough, the film wasn't nearly as scary or as engrossing as the games were, but for a movie based on a videogame, it was surprisingly good, great even.<br />The success of the original silent hill movie made me hopeful that the sequel would be just as good, if not better than the first film. And while Silent Hill Revelation never quite scales the heights reached by the original film, it's an enjoyable tale with some very impressive and spooky moments sprinkled throughout.<br />First thing I have to commend are some of the casting choices. The gorgeous Adelaide Clemens is perfectly cast as Heather and I can't think of anyone more fitting to play the silent hill 3 heroine. Sean Bean was criticised in the original movie for his poor american accent. However he performs much more admirably in Revelation and his British accent is almost impossible to detect. One cast member who didn't impress me however, was Kit Harington, better known as Jon Snow in HBO's stunning drama series, Game Of Thrones. While Kit is excellent in GOT, he basically sleepwalks through this movie, with poor line delivery and some scenes where he just seems to not be putting any effort into his role. But overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting quality in the film.<br />A lot of the plot will be familiar to anyone who has played silent hill 3 but there are enough differences to keep the story interesting to even those who have completed the game multiple times. Without spoiling anything, Heather Mason and her father Harry(not their real names.) are on the run from a strange cult who want Heather to return to silent hill for unknown reasons. For the most part I enjoyed the story in Silent Hill Revelation. The pacing is a bit all over the place at times and the ending was dissapointing in my opinion, but overall the films plot had enough to keep me interested to the end. Whereas the original is often criticised for being too long, this film suffers from the exact opposite problem. At just over 90 minutes, SHR just doesn't have enough time to effectively develop it characters and story. In my opinion, another half hour of run time would have made a world of difference.<br />An important aspect of the games are the terrifying environments and creatures you meet while playing. SHR pretty much nails these very important points. The environments are beautiful and disgusting at the same time and the creatures are just as freaky and abnormal as you'd expect..<br />I've been thinking long and hard about what rating I should award this film. I was considering awarding it four stars for a time, but four stars generally signifies an excellent film which Silent Hill Revelation certainly isn't. However, I also don't think it's deserved the critical mauling it has received. I enjoyed it and I certainly wouldn't mind viewing it a second or even third time. If that doesn't deserve at least three stars, I don't know what does.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Interesting plot.  It's like 'Prisoners of War' only American style.  I liked the show but there was too much cursing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have a 1 year old who can barely talk, but he can ask for Piano Guys. My 3 yr old and older children love them, too, though they all prefer the videos. Since they're making specials with PBS hopefully a DVD or Bluray will come out someday, but for now this is music I think is actually good for my kids, and they can all agree on what to listen to.

0345803485|2.0|I had read a lot about this trilogy and was pretty darn sure it wasn't going to be my type of book.  Several friends warned me off of it but one good friend loved it so I decided to cave in and see what this was all about.  First off, I didn't think the book was as poorly written as I had heard.  I've read a lot of independent authors and I had to quit reading more than a few stories due to how poorly they were written or edited.  I did find this first installment to be boring.  After the first steamy scene or two, those even became repetitive.  I didn't like how mousy and accepting Ana was with Christian, although I did like her character other times.  Now Christian...darn it.  I just didn't like him.  I never grew to like him much over the next two books either. His back story is very sad and yes, it explained why he was so messed up but it didn't condone his behavior as an adult.  I never really bought why he thought Ana was so special and different from the previous women either.  Still I did read the entier book and was suprised by the fact that it was (even with my complaints) better than I had expected.  Still my book preferences tend to be more toward action and suspense and strong female urban fantasy charcters who fight for whats right and don't take stuff from their men...and lets face it, Ana is the exact opposite of that.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|ThePianoGuys are now my favorite musical group. They can take autotuned pop music and make it beautiful. They can take classical pieces and update them to make them exciting. They can bring movie themes to life, sometimes better than the movie! They are so talented and creative and their music is amazing, relaxing, beautiful, and inspiring. There's a song on this CD for every mood. What makes it even better is the FUN they have with every song! All you have to do is check out their YouTube channel and see how they always have a have a sense of humor and a grin on their faces while playing their instruments. I can't wait for their future installments!<br /><br />A great gift for a music lover of any kind.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Prometheus is a great addition to the sci-fi genre. It delves into existential themes while delivering thrills, gorgeous scenery, and excellent performances. One important thing one must realize before watching this film is that while it is based on the Alien franchise (and it does a great job of alluding to it), Prometheus is not a prequel. Instead, it better thought of as a story in a parallel universe. Apart from that, if you're going to buy the movie, you might as well get the 3D/BD/DVD combo because this film was meant to be watched in 3D and it is splendid, and you get all the cool extra features. Its worth it to sci-fi fans, and fans of the Alien series (as long as they dont watch thinking it is a prequel)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this album after being introduced to the Piano Guys by a friend, as it was so worth it. I love everything on this album, and if you've ever seen one of their videos, you know that they love what they're doing, and that comes out in the quality of the music.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy is one of the coolest film series ever. That's all I have to say about the films. This trio-package is awesome though. It is beautiful and it comes with a cool booklet full of artwork. This is truly a must for fans that just can't get enough of the bat.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie advances the story of his First Law world in exciting ways, taking it into the realm of the western and even throws in a little steampunk to boot. One of his most beloved characters returns as well as a few others and we get a tale that's a fun mix of Unforgiven meets the Searchers meets Deadwood with swords instead of guns.<br /><br />Shy South is a farm girl who returns from a trip to market to find the farm burned to the ground and her brother and sister taken by  some group of outlaws that steals kids. She goes in pursuit with her farmhand Lamb, a big, hulking, scarred north man who backs down from every violent encounter, but he changes quickly as they pursue these bandits and the mayhem begins.<br /><br />On the way they meet up with a bunch of characters including Nicomo Cosca, Shivers, Friendly and some new faces including Temple, a lawyer in a lawless frontier.<br /><br />Its entertaining from start to finish, I was waiting all year for this book and was not disappointed.

B0084670FU|1.0|Babel's story line is a sermon/rant against a couple of important US policies - those involving immigration and guns.  There are no heroes in this story.  Well, there is almost one - the nanny.  But she also is drawn into a casual clandestine encounter.  Then and later she is less than dependable in regards to her charges.<br />This movie is unnecessarily graphic about sex, mostly in relation to a couple of children's interest in and experimentation.  That is just the hook that is supposed to draw people in, I suppose, though it nearly made me turn it off.  I wish I had.  Graphic violence is also treated w/ shocking casualness.

B007REV4YI|4.0|Ok so right up front I've never been a huge bond fan. I saw quantum of solace before I saw casino royale. I did not really enjoy quantum of solace but rather enjoyed casino royale. So I went into this not really knowing what to expect. I must say I was rather impressed and entertained.<br /><br />The story starts out with an intense chase scene that grabs your attention right away. It may have been over the top a bit but still it was awesome. Through the chase and a risky shot, Bond is left for dead. Of course he survives but remains \\"dead\\" to the world until he sees on the news that MI6 has been attacked.  It seems that the terrorist behind the attack is always one step ahead. This film deals with Bond trying to prove to M and himself he still is the agent he always has been. MI6 is coming under heavy scrutiny for losing classified information all while \\"M\\" and Bond's relationship is stressed throughout the film.<br /><br />Bond finally tracks down the terrorist behind the MI6 attacks to find that it is a former agent assumed dead.  This agent is a cyber terrorist who has immense power and a vendetta against \\"M\\". He tries to recruit Bond but fails as Bond brings him in only to discover this was his plan all along. The films follows Bond, \\"M\\", and the terrorist Silva to a gripping and entertaining end.<br /><br />The soundtrack is amazing. I literally can't get enough of Adelle and the Skyfall song. Action is great...maybe a little less action than some of the other Bond's but nonetheless great. The story is very very personal. Which I actually liked. I must say that this is a great film that every action fan and bond fan must see.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins and team show masterful dedication and precision when it comes to their approach on drawing the conclusions presented in this book.  Using Aristotelian logic and Socratic questioning, the team's bias had no part in the analysis of what it takes to go from good to great.  But, what transcended the business jargon was the undeniable fact that this is also a book on what it takes to make a mediocre life, a great life.<br /><br />Collins' use of straightforward diction allows Good to Great to be digested by age groups ranging from high school on up.  It speaks to the common man, even though its information is derived using some of the most successful companies and corporations in the world as the context.  Constant repeating of each principle allows for greater understanding and absorption of the key factors.  This repetition only adds to the flow of the book, demonstrating the compounding affect the factors have on the overall success of Good-to-Great Companies.  All the while, holding onto the relationship between these principles and a fulfilled life.<br /><br />In conclusion, Good to Great is closed very elegantly by Collins, were he states: \\"When all these pieces [principles] come together, not only does your work move toward greatness, but so does your life.  For, in the end, it is impossible to have a great life unless it is a meaningful life.  And it is very difficult to have a meaningful life without meaningful work (p.210).\\"  Hand in hand, work and life stroll happily - or miserably - together, each working off one another like a couple deeply in love.  There is a way to extract the most joy out of life and Collins reveals a way.  Are there other ways: absolutely.  But, what holds true no matter the process, it begins and ends with passion.  Find that passion, act on that passion, and take your time.  All other successes will come naturally.  Or so says Collins...
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Liked the music and the story line from the past. Brought current with modern day situations and added a bit more humor; nice touch.  There were a few lags but made up for with next dramatic scenes. Could have done without the sexual references...no needed!  I grew up watching the soap, every late afternoon, after school and Depp really portrayed Barnabas well and the Dr. was spot on! Was a worthwhile rental.
0375869026|5.0|I first wanted to read Wonder after catching a glimpse of the cover on my library's website.  I knew nothing about the book at the time, but I was struck by the illustration of a boy's face with a single eye visible.  Having grown up with a close relative who was visually impaired in one eye and had lost the other eye to an abscess after a botched surgery, I could not perfectly relate to Auggie's circumstances, but I had long seen the pain and shame my relative faced, just as I had seen many people stare in shock or even horror.  Needless to say, I was certainly invested in the idea of a book that wanted to examine life from the point of view of someone who was considered disfigured by others.<br /><br />Having now read it, I am happy to say I was not disappointed at all.  I thought the author managed to write a very compelling story that depicted character depth in both Auggie and his social circle.  Best of all, the book neither stooped to making Auggie a distant object of pity nor did the book come across as making the reader feel guilty or implicated for any negative reactions the 'average' person had to Auggie or might have to a real-life Auggie. Auggie's pain was certainly portrayed, but there was so much more to him than that.<br /><br />While some reviewers have expressed that they did not like the alternating narratives, I thought this enhanced the story. This is partially for something I mentioned above, which is that the book - by focusing on other points of view besides Auggie's - makes this NOT a treatise on appreciating and being kind to people who are supposedly 'different' from us, but it gives voice to the other perspectives as well.  And in doing so, (I believe) it shows that it is natural to feel conflicted when you are the loving and protective but oh-so-conspicuous family member of someone like Auggie, just as it is natural to be surprised and even uncomfortable when encountering something unusual to you. Because of this, I thought the stories of Auggie's sister and some of his friends were so crucial to the book, particularly as a catalyst for discussion of these issues amongst children. For example, I think reading about another child's less-than-ideal initial reaction to Auggie can allow for more honest reflection from readers about how they might have reacted in a similar situation. The book never sets up a precedent that people must - or do - respond perfectly all of the time, but it does emphasize growth in almost everyone.  That is what I think is so powerful about it.<br /><br />(Powerful enough that I cried a few times while reading this children's book.  As a new mother, I also bawled when I read the part about Auggie asking his mother why he was so ugly.)<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.f Auggie's sister and some of his friends were so crucial to the book, particularly as a catalyst for discussion of these issues amongst children.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|I got this book on my Kindle, since Tom Hanks was making a movie out of it and he doesn't make bad movies. I felt like I was slogging through molasses every time I turned the kindle on and read it. It was a tortuous tale of a man who had a stroke (?) and his hallucinations during his recovery I think but I'm not at all sure. My mom had some crazy hallucinations during her stroke- perhaps there's a movie there? Hmmmm. I think I missed the point. Perhaps a college offering could explain it to me.....

0316228532|1.0|Let me begin by saying I LOVED the Harry Potter books!  Rowling created a fanciful world in those books in which one could lose oneself.  Her language was so rich, and she painted such amazing word pictures in such deep hues.  She brought children's books back into the category of literature.  So it is with GREAT disappointment that after forcing myself through almost half of The Casual Vacancy, I close it and give up; I will not and cannot finish this book.  Boring, boring, BORING.  There is not one character in this book (and there are probably too many to choose from) that I remotely begin to like.  The language feels forced; the word pictures are dingy at best.  If this books paints a picture of the English countryside and its people, I don't want to visit.  (If I could give it no stars, I would.  But they won't publish without at least one.)  Can I have my money back?????

B0083H6AQA|4.0|In all honesty, this film isn't for everyone and it is a period piece based on French author Guy de Maupassant's second novel, 'Bel Ami' (Beautiful Friend), also known as 'The History of a Scoundrel.' I'm sure these two factors will scare off some people or appear on the surface to be boring, but the truth is both the novel and the film are well worth the money and the time to read and to watch; trust me it isn't as literary as it is made out to be, and both are a lot of fun, if for a bit you can leave morals and ethics at the proverbial door, and just let yourself enjoy it for the debauchery, the sex, and the immorality of it all.<br /><br />The film itself is well made, with an amazing period piece wardrobe and settings true to the time period. The director's Declan Donnellan and Nick Ornerod, best known for their theater work, artfully bring this novel to life on the screen, mixing the nuances and intimacy of theater, with the broad scope of film craft. The lead cast of the film, Robert Pattinson, Uma Thurman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Christina Ricci, and Colm Meaney, give stellar performances, worthy of mention. And for anyone that's been in doubt about Robert Pattinson's acting ability, this film is a shining example of his true talent (As are 'Little Ashes' and 'Cosmopolis,' which I'd highly recommend, as well).

B008602KQI|4.0|If you enjoyed Suzanne Collin's novels then you will most likely enjoy the film version, as well. Much like the novels, to someone well read and/or someone who is a film buff, this is a fresh-take and entertaining film, but truly not all that original in concept; the same argument can be said of the novels. To a new generation without an extensive knowledge of books and films, it probably seems original and fresh, though; and let's face it themes get redone countless times in various generations, so this is not unique to Suzanne Collin's novels or the 'Hunger Games' film. While I enjoyed the novels and this first film in the series, in all honesty, I've seen this theme countless times, as I mentioned in both novels and films prior to this series, and done much better quite frankly. But for what it is, it is a fresh take on an age-old theme, it is entertaining, well made, and for the most part, well-acted by the actors.

First of all I appreciate anyone who serves our country so thank you Kyle. I so badly wanted to like this book but it was so badly written! I did finish it but it was REALLY hard to get through. I did not like Chris Kyle even a little and by the end of the book I was boarding on more then just not liking him. I do understand that he had a job to do but the way he describes somethings left me cold and sick to my stomach. Even the way he was towards his kids and his wife. Just not a man I care to know and one I know to much about from reading this now.

B005O59C0K|5.0|Frank Sinatra became a teen idol on the Columbia label during the early 1940s and a movie star in the latter half of the decade. He sold a lot of singles, but his career stalled in 1950 as he suffered both a hemorrhaging of the vocal cords and a debilitating depression. It was when he moved to Capitol in 1953 and started releasing \\"concept albums\\" that his popularity skyrocketed again. This was music for adults, and they responded by snapping up Frank's LPs by the millions. The selection of songs displayed sophistication, their interpretations demonstrated great depth, and the orchestrations, from brilliant arrangers like Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins, and Billy May, are without parallel even today.<br /><br />Between 1955 and 1960, six of Sinatra's Capitol releases were certified gold (selling more than 500,000 copies), and one, \\"A Jolly Christmas,\\" went platinum (over a million copies). Four of these bestselling albums (\\"Come Fly With Me,\\" \\"Come Dance with Me,\\" \\"Nice 'n' Easy,\\" and the holiday disc) appear on this European compilation from Real Gone Jazz, which includes half of Frank's 16 Capitol LPs on four CDs. They range from the lighthearted \\"A Swingin' Affair\\" to the despairing \\"No One Cares.\\" My favorite record is the breezy \\"Come Fly with Me,\\" but they're all terrific.<br /><br />While there are no liner notes for this compilation, the sound is crystal clear, and the low price is the frosting on the cake. As wonderful as \\"Eight Classic Albums\\" is, I look forward to Volume 2 and the remaining Capitol albums, particularly the joyful \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers,\\" and two dark, brooding sets about lost love, \\"In the Wee Small Hours\\" and \\"Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely,\\" which must be counted among his finest achievements.<br /><br />A full list of tracks and timings follows:<br /><br />CD 1: A Swingin' Affair (1957) / A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra (1957)<br />1.

B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show. This was the first thing i downloaded to my kindle and it played great on my kindle HD
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I love Carrie Underwood.  Her voice is just amazing and she stand for so much.  She is a great role model for young girls.  There isn't a bad song on this album.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano guys have AMAZING music.  My whole family loves to listen to them- even my 4 kids.  The music is so inspirational, relaxing, but yet uplifting & energizing. ( I know those sound like opposites & they are, but that is just how amazing these guys are - they can pull all of that off in 1 song!!!)
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Having been a Soundgarden fan since early high school, I wasn't sure what to expect from their comeback album, the first in 16 long years. Not only has technology, the bandmembers' age, and MTV changed; the musical landscape itself has transformed tremendously since the mid '90s. The fading grunge scene has all but died, paving the way for countless uninspired bands like some kind of cruel slash-and-burn cycle that began with a beautiful forest but ended with an ugly cold jungle. However, in the midst of said forest, there has always been a garden. Sometimes serene, sometimes abrasive, sometimes not even appearing at all, this garden is more or less the genesis AND revelation of alternative heaviness. Obviously, this palindromic force is Soundgarden. Reforming in 2010 with a new compilation album, their reunion generated a lot of feedback, but the &#34;new&#34; songs on the album didn't really generate much buzz. Likewise, their song for the &#34;AVENGERS&#34; soundtrack was fair as a standalone rock song, but absolutely stale and generic for a band with such unprecedented power and unpredictability. Was Soundgarden still able to kindle the fire they'd created long ago? I treaded cautiously but enthusiastically while preparing for their comeback album....  The lead single, &#34;Been Away Too Long,&#34; makes a LOT of sense. Perhaps too much, as it almost seems like a blatant marketing attempt to get everyone charged up with a kick-ass rock song that disguises an album that may otherwise not be representative of Soundgarden's uncompromising sound. Thankfully, that notion is false. In fact, &#34;Been Away Too Long&#34; is one of the lesser tracks on the album. &#34;Non-State Actor&#34; has a funky drive and a hell of a lot of attitude, and in my opinion, it's the REAL album opener. &#34;By Crooked Steps&#34; introduces Open-D (DADF#AD) tuning to their sonic catalog, with superb results. It has an almost dissonant time signature, but with repeated listens, it becomes apparent that it's subtly fantastic work- much like the album itself. Then there's the album's absolute masterpiece- &#34;A Thousand Days Before.&#34; It begins with a serene, meditative guitar riff that'll make you crank the volume until a surprise ditty makes you jump out of your seat (it happened to me). An almost wistful track, the song will make you feel romantic, reminiscent, and powerful at the same time, as Chris sings, &#34;Here in the cold, where no one stands beside me/ I'll be on my own side, you know where to find me...&#34; It's an anthem for the loner in all of us. Other highlights include the creeping &#34;Blood on the Valley Floor&#34;(with a riff that's cerebral and slugging), the eerily mortal &#34;Bones of Birds&#34;(with an anthemic chorus reminiscent of &#34;Blow up the Outside World&#34;), the folky &#34;Black Saturday,&#34; and the epic &#34;Rowing,&#34; the album's closing song that manages to be simultaneously soothing, unsettling, and leaving the listener thirsty for more.  All in all, this is an album that takes TIME to grown on the listener. It lacks the hooks of their previous albums, including Down on the Upside, but you know what? This album is more rewarding, more precise, and more confident than ANY grunge album released since Screaming Trees' 1996 opus, &#34;Dust&#34;. Listen for yourself. It may take weeks, months, years to fully comprehend this album. In a sense, that makes the listener hope that the sheer mystery of this release will never dissipate.  Final Score: 8.1/10
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This music is awesome and inspiring!!!! I would say is the best piano music I have ever heard. Very creative and enjoyable to listen to.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She doesn't like to read but loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. Whatever books that entice her to read are worth buying.
B0035RFYT2|5.0|Great pose.  Excellent sculpt.  Perfect for whatever you're buying a little wolf figurine for.  It'd be great for kids too.  Perfect size for a G.I. Joe animal (example: Timber for Snake-Eyes).
1419702238|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She doesn't like to read but loves these books. Anything to get her to read is worth buying.
B002GL391S|5.0|El maestro Kurosawa goza de muy poca fama en el mundo Hispano,  pero si usted ya lo conoce y ha visto alguna(s) de sus películas, entonces es probable que  le agrade ésta a pesar de ser muy diferente a sus producciones anteriores que se caracterizaron por un gran grado de realismo.<br /><br />Aquí en cambio Akira Kurosawa -a punto de terminar su carrera cinematográfica- se adentro en el mundo de la fantasía, una fantasía artística muy diferente de los productos comerciales y superconvencionales que al menos a mi ya me han aburrido por ser tan repetitivos: desastres, superpoderes, monstruos, etc.<br /><br />Esta película podría ser su producción mas agradable a la vista por los hermosos paisajes que nos muestra, además de ser muy relajante en ciertos segmentos y es que esta película es una colección de sueños, tal y como lo dice el titulo.<br /><br />La ambigüedad abunda en este filme a lo largo de sus historias cortas, así como fines librados a la imaginación de público. A mi agrada este estilo, que es un poco popular en el Lejano Oriente, aunque aquí ene l occidente ciertamente no lo es tanto. Mi mejor recomendación es que usted vea este film dejándose llevar por la fantasía de su ambiente de sublime cultura japonesa y oriental en su trasfondo.
1400069181|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm now even a bigger fan of Toms and Blake Mycoske.  I listened to it on audio and found it very entertaining.  There are a lot of great ideas on how you too can start something that matters.  An inspiration and highly recommended.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My daughter had to get her hands on the next Wimpy Kid book.....and the new ebook version worked out great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long while. Chalk full of symbology and in depth looks at major religions. Very graphic at times but the story is an excellent one.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|I thought the movie was great and would recommend it.  Bought another one for a Christmas gift for some friends
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We have been enjoying the Piano Guys for at least a year now. Our almost 2 year old daughter frequently asks to listen to or watch the \\"guys\\". Having this album is a great addition to our musical library. Especially enjoyed hearing the new piece \\"Arwen's Vigil\\" for which there has not been a video released. Beautiful piece! Great compilation of some of their great covers. Certainly one to get.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It was pretty good.  pretty much what I was expecting from MIB.  It never fails to make me laugh.  I would definately watch again!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Excellent, but I didn't quite &#34;Love it!&#34;  I was glad to see Kirk as a young rouge - it added a lot to the character.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Great production. One of the best series I have watched. The twists and turns make you want to watch more.
0385536828|3.0|I am a longtime fan of McEwan and I was a bit disappointed by this one. I read it in one sitting, it definitely kept my interest up, and the psychological insights were spot on as they usually are. I really enjoy McEwan's female protagonists because they sound so convincingly female.  However I felt that overall something was lacking. For one, the ending is not satisfying, it leaves a lot of doubt and the story really did need a resolution in my opinion.  Secondly, I felt that some characters were pointless and other more important characters were not explored enough. If you are looking for a \\"good\\" read this is miles ahead of the typical stuff out there. McEwan has a mastery of the English language that sadly most current American authors do not. However it is nowhere near his best work.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I'd rather use the mobile website instead of this app, at least with the website I can get my whole news feed!
1439152799|4.0|I checked out the book-on-CD version from the library after reading the great reviews from this site. To my surprise, I almost gave up listening early on because the first few CDs were slow in story development due to the extreme details that seemed overbearing to me. It was also not easy to follow the story due to the back-and-forth changes in time frames, especially when all characters were read by one narrator only. I actually fell asleep listening to it so many times that was quite ridiculous. Fortunately, I convinced myself to continue and I have to say the best part was at the last CD when finally everything made sense and the ending was quite interesting and satisfactory.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My friend Laura recommended this book and I am so glad she did.  Laura and her husband Rob are NLP Master Practioners.  They are life coaches who help people find the root causes of their disease or anxiety. [...]  After the death of my husband, I was lost and lonely.  I was afraid to love again mainly because I didn't feel loved.  In the words of Gary Chapman.  \\"I had an empty love tank.\\" With an empty love tank, I couldn't see how others were trying to tell me that they loved me.  Gary Chapman's book, allowed me to see how people speak love.  Some people show love by doing little things for them.  Others by buying gifts; others by words of encouragement and affirmation; others by spending time with them; and still others by touching/hugging etc. This sounds so simple.  It is.  But not everyone speaks the same language. Learning to speak the language your loved ones speak and knowing what love language you speak is the challenge and the secret to being in love with all those you love. Thank you, Laura for this recommendation.  And thank you Gary for writing this book.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|Not bad for a web-series/video game movie. Definitely way better than any of those movies you'd see on the syfy channel.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I read on another review that this was the Temple of Pharoah version of Bubble Shooter. I used to play this all the time on POGO games and loved it. Awesome spin on a great classic.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|My brother's family will love this not just for the holiday but for years to come. Thanks! I remember watching a couple of these in the theater with the same brother. LOL
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was so similar to Fifty Shades of Grey it was difficult to finish. Sex scenes were steamy and exciting but rapidly became redundant. The emotional baggage they both carry is a little too much for me, especially how they turn to each other for gratification in such a violent way, it's just plain disturbing towards the end.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fresh story line. But if you want a cheap thrill that you will walk away from feeling dirty, this is the book for you!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best Zombie book I've read.  If you are a fan of the Walking Dead series you will love this book!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed season 1 and am excited for season 2. Overall the season was great but I'm a little worried about how they continue the story in season 2.
B0019IB0II|4.0|The description of her stroke happening form her point of view was a little scary for me to read. Her recovery shows the amount of retrainable brain available when hard work and persistence are evoked.
B000AS4L16|5.0|Shoah is a great film, and an important one, not to be missed. But it's not a good one. I watched it over a 4-month period, mostly in 2-hours stints. It's over 9-1/2 hours long. Claude Lanzmann intended for the viewer to see it in one sitting, perhaps with a short intermission.<br />The average viewer won't recognize it as a film - a movie - at all, but as a document, which is what it really is - a document that's not only a testament to the horror, cruelty, inhumanity and suffering perpetrated on the Jews by the Germans and Poles in World War 2, but a testament to Lanzmann's perseverance, anger, discipline, fearlessness, energy and sense of justice. Yet all that doesn't necessarily make a film that's very watchable or even effective as a purge or as an education. Lanzmann chose very deliberately NOT to include archival footage in his film - of which an enormous amount exists: footage of the starved and doomed and dead and dying, and of their oppressors, where they lived, how they were tortured, marched, transported, rotted in the streets. Instead, his film comprises interviews with survivors, Nazi soldiers and administrators, endless interviews by people who look normal, sane, even healthy, witnesses, and of the empty concentration camp fields, towns, villages, forests, railroads, factories, cities, and rooms that remained (as of 1985, when it was released to universal acclaim, and during the many preceding years of research, filming, travel, editing, and planning) after the Holocaust was over. If it was ever over. In my opinion this intellectual or aeshetic approach to telling the story was a poor one, and fails to horrify the viewer. And horror is the only proper response. Shoah merely fascinates, outrages, pains and infuriates. But in my opinion only an up close and personal recreation of the worst horrors that are recounted and are well-documented by thousands of historians, the Nazis themselves, artists, and survivors could come close to reminding. We need tobe scarrred the way a brand, a tattoo might do - future viewers have to feel in their blood what human beings were once - and still are - capable of doing to others in the name of ideology, bureaucracy, politics, government, righteousness, race and what Amitav Ghosh calls supremacism. Blood should run from the screen. That aside, Lanzmann's film hypnotizes the attentive viewer with information and memories - and the absence of both - much of which come from the mouths and faces of the people who made or saw or felt it happen. What was it like for mothers and sons and fathers and brothers to watch their kin be tortured and murdered and walk naked to their deaths? Shoah can only  make you imagine: it does not traffic in the gruesome, the specific, the flesh. It tries to make do with language and imagination - and with silence and emptiness Nevertheless, Lanzmann's dogged, relentless pursuit of these people - murderers, officials and victims alike - across continents and countries is breathtaking and awesome, and some of the sequences, such as his having people sing the same songs they did in the camps, or drive the same locomotive on the same rails, or force their recollections through sobs and tears, have become famous and iconic images, even though, in my opinion, they aren't as devastating and heartrending as they're meant to be. Because the viewer is overwhelmed with information, with repetition, with hearing what he expects to hear. Overwhelmed but not injured, educated but not changed. And yet: what else could Lanzmann have done with his nearly lifelong, obsessive effort to keep these memories alive, to confront the remaining agents of horror - the faces and voices of what became unspeakable now appearing as common, sometimes ignorant, self-interested survivors whose very continuation into the present day seems an affront to humanity and biology. Can people live with such pain? With the inadequacy of words, of translation, the limits of memory? Can people stillsmile so heartlessly or pitiably, or be so helplessly, hopelessly willing to remember?  Can everything be explained, justified, transcended? The film itself came out 40 years after the Holocaust - and so much had already been forgotten, buried, outgrown and overgrown, denied. Now it's 67 years later. Where in the world - in theatres, on television, on mobile devices, in schools, in libraries, in churches and mosques and synagogues - will Shoah be shown? Who will ask for it, or assign it, or even believe how or why it was made, especially when all popular commercial imagery now makes the calculated, industrial, sadistic, low-tech violence of those times seem paltry,slow, unimaginagive, exaggerated and even boring by comparison? When the next Holocaust occurs, who will care about this one?
B00338QENI|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me. It was amazing to me how this poor little woman ended up deeply entrenched in the most advance cancer research, and her family was unaware of all that was happening. Great book!

0545265355|5.0|I bought these books for my son after much nagging and anticipation. He loves them. I think he has read the series now like three times. Kinda hard to yell at him for not doing his chores when he is reading. Better than watching TV or playing video games.<br />Signed,<br />Happy Father

0307949486|4.0|I read this book in German and it was great - hard to put down and he kept me guessing until the end to see who actually did it. Some may be complaining about too much background story, and I admit, since I have never been to Sweden, it was hard to imagine the places, however, I think it was necessary to put them in the book. You have to understand why the he can go to Hedestad and how it is connected to the players in the book.
0553124986|5.0|I dont like to review books because i rarely purchase books for pleasure.  However the book did make it to me so good job.

B008JAG2AA|5.0|I was pretty sure the American Pie series had jumped the shark several sequels ago, but this was a pleasant surpise, with plenty of new material and surprising originality.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Witty humor, orginal plot, and lots of fun.  Some intense scenes of peril that were a bit much for my 3 year old, but overall, my kids loved it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These fine musicians are creative, passionate, with a sense of humor while keeping close to and honoring the intent of the composers. They are a credit to their talent, families, Church and country.. I am so pleased with the manner in which the music which flows from their imagination has the ability to soothe my troubled heart when most needed. This album continues with their legend.<br /><br />Thank you so much for the hours of pure entertainment guys<br /><br />Karolyn Gillum

B00004XPPK|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE...RITA HAYWORTH AT HER SEXIEST...GLEN FORD<br />GORGEOUS.  THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THEM AS THEY USED TO. RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I am not interested in any HALO games or anime, but this was really good. They really should continue the movies just like this one, not animated:) Glad I rented it!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is actually the first (and last) book of the series that I've read.  I purchased it because I had watched the movie which is based on this novel and I wanted to know what happened in part two (whether the same or not)  without waiting for the movie.  After finishing the book, I went out and saw the movie- was not disappoint on either count.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You start out with very basic boards... thinking where is the challenge going to be, then you find it.  I agree it is addictive.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It takes an interesting approach being told from the perspective of a 5-year. What could have been simply a depressing and harrowing tale of abduction, turns out to be a hopeful tale that demonstrates the power of a mother's love and strong survival instinct.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|No matter what my mood or the context of the day, The Piano Guys are AMAZING!  Theirs is perfect music for dishes, studying, baby sitting,dancing, baking or just sacking out on the couch, listening!  Anyone who has (or desires) an ear for good music should be listening to TPG!
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I bought this to make centerpieces for my wedding and it works perfectly.  I did not use the tapper as a video I watched on YouTube demonstrated a hot water/cold water method.  This product can create a perfect score and is simple to use.
B0091LS07E|3.0|Maybe Girl On Fire was that album where every artists tries something new and forgets what got them there. In Alicia Keys' case, thats this album. I'm a huge fan and have seen her live in Oakland, Santa Barbara, San Jose, and Oakland again. I'll see her again next time she tours but not to hear any songs on this album. I've listend it to it twice and still am not feeling it like I did on her previous albums. I also did not know Girl On Fire was a duet with Minaj which ruined it for me. Where is the Woman's Worth or No One, Love Is Blind, Un-thinkable equivalent song? It's not here on this album. They are all slow and ballad type and some with too long piano intros. If you've been a fan prior to this album you'll likely stay a fan because you know Keys' track record and potential. Unfortunately I don't think new fans were gained by this album.<br /><br />I'm just confused with this album when compared to her previous. There aren't any songs that make me (30 year old whiteboy) uncontrollably and rhythmically bob my head like so many songs on each of her previous albums. I'll give it another listen but actually think I'll run through Element of Freedom and As I Am again.
B00005RG6B|5.0|The fact that this was their most produced stage show makes this a must have. I am ordering this for my son. I saw them live many times and want my son to experience it too. A must have for the fan.
1451627297|2.0|Every book that is super long carries its own demons I always say. 11/22/63 does just that. I went into this book expecting one thing and was given another. Now to be honest, this isn't my fault. The book's title clearly states that it is called 11/22/63, the day that Kennedy is assassinated as many know. Well, to point out this is an extreme case of false advertisement. A more suitable title would be: Screwing around in History from 1958-1963.<br /><br />It has been quite a long time since a single character frustrated me so much as did Jake Epping/George Amberson. Every time I turned around I was letting out huge sighs at how silly this man actually was.<br /><br />Let's start off with this knowledge. He knows that he will be heading into the past to change history. He talks with the owner of the portal about the Butterfly effect. He even states himself that he knows full well that his actions, and when I say actions, I mean any action: Ordering toast, talking to someone, his mere existence in a time not of his own can cause serious ramifications down the line. So with that knowledge, what would a normal person do? Not what Jake Epping does, no sir! He decides that he will start teaching at a school. Interacting with dozens of children an hour, every hour, for two solid years. Not so bright for a teacher I say. That poor butterfly must have died it flapped its wings so hard.<br /><br />So armed with his idiocy and for some reason the thing swinging between his britches like he is some teenage boy meeting a girl for the first time he continues to be silly for several years in the past.<br /><br />Stephen King implements an idea early on that \\"Time\\" is trying to stop him from preventing the main character from changing history. By even suggesting that idea, it opens the door to the claim that if that is the case that \\"Time\\" would be daily hindering him, since the main character is preventing an history from running its course every day, for five freakin' years.<br /><br />Now, if the book had a fitting title that claimed it was more of a man's interactions with people in a small town in the \\"land of ago\\" rather than tricking you into thinking the main point of the story is about preventing the assassination of a president then I would have come in knowing the full nature of the book. Also, the length of the book was a little too long. This nearly 900 page book has within its pages a really good 400 page story. Too much detail goes into, in my opinion, really boring events. A school play (which brought everyone to tears), a football game, a school dance, the lindy hop, a wedding, a funeral, another school play (which of course was supposedly amazing also), eating bacon, driving on the road, another dance, watching a fight, having sex with a boring smoker woman who comes with her own set of issues. Yes. That's right. Those scenes have to be the worst! I tried to skim through as best I could, but couldn't help stop what can't be undone. Because why you must ask? Because the past is obdurate. Yep, by the way you're gonna end up hating that word, and I hope you can come away from the novel and not have your world shattered by the mere mention of the word \\"poundcake\\" ~shudder~!<br /><br />This book by far misses the mark for me. The book takes place over the course of 5 years, it shouldn't feel like I spent 5 years there myself. So many times I caught myself saying, \\"Come on, let's go!!\\" Every day was described in epic detail far beyond the capacity of its need. \\"I pulled out my pen, took off the cap, wrote down something, pondered what I wrote, opened the drawer of my desk, put the pen therein, closed the drawer, I picked a booger from my nose and flicked it to the floor, and marveled at the sound it made. There was ka-swoosh as it collided with the carpet, I stood, stretched my legs that were by now aching, I realized I needed the pen so I put the pen in my pocket, walked to the door, twisted the knob, it creaked loudly, opened the door, walked through the entryway, pulled the door closed, pulled my keys from my pocket, retrieved my keys, locked the door, put my keys back into my pocket, walked to my car, pulled out my keys again, unlocked the car, the hinges squealed like a pig at a butcher's shop, closed the door, sat on the bucket seat. Then I forgot why I got into the car to begin with, did I need milk, or was it eggs. Perhaps I should got back inside and see what I wrote down. I opened the door.\\" It was scenes like this that grated my nerves. It was like someone followed this guy around and dictated his every movement.<br /><br />King really needs an editor, a good one too, that can go through his manuscripts and just start pulling out all the fluff, and that might have made all the difference in the world for me. I'm sure many people probably loved it, but because of the flaws I came across this book ends up as just an average read.e door, walked through the entryway, pulled the door closed, pulled my keys from my pocket, retrieved my keys, locked the door, put my keys back into my pocket, walked to my car, pulled out my keys again, unlocked the car, the hinges squealed like a pig at a butcher's shop, closed the door, sat on the bucket seat.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|Seller was great, but this Lifeproof case was horrible for my iPhone 4! Not only is it nearly impossible to get the cheap plastic film screen top to adhere without bubbling, but you can barely swipe or push keys through the phone. The \\"Silent button\\" on the side (turns the ringer off/on on the iPhone 4) would NOT work at all. And the worst part of all is the muffled sound, no matter what I tried, how many video tutorials I viewed or support areas I went to for help. I do love the Lifeproof tutorial videos on their website though, which is a shame bc they're great and fun/helpful. And the case was indeed waterproof when I did the water test. But what's the point of having a waterproof phone that you can't hear callers on (and they can't hear you), nor hear your music etc?? No thanks...I have a toddler who has tossed my phone in the toilet, and I also live at the beach (50 yards from the water), but I'd much rather take my chances and keep my phone functioning. Shame this case was such a dud bc I was excited. Hope someone invents new FUNCTIONAL \\"waterproof case technology\\" very soon. What a pos. (And I really hope this seller refunds my credit card asap!)
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It's about a raunchy Boston teddy-bear that comes to life and gets high with with his 35 year old best friend when they are grown up.  You should know what to expect, and best picture ain't it.  However if you like the dry, often sarcastic, humor presented by The Family Guy this movie is hysterical.  Despite the funny antics it has a message about responsibility and growing up and actually can strike an emotional cord.  Worth a watch or two, just not with your kids.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod has moved into a wonderful realm now with his singing and this album really shows it.  One of my favorites

B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great movie, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law worked great together as well as in the first Sherlock Holmes movie.  Very entertaining, great graphic effects and lots of action/suspense.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I bought this because this is one of my favorite classic movies of all time. Yes, the accents and the actors are as spot on as they can be.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Story too predictable  characters not deep enough. The mother character is the same one from the notebook. Storyline similar.  But I do love sparks books.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I love the cast. The jokes are fantastic if you get them. Great movie to just sit back and relax.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is so addicting and i cant stop playing it! Sometimes it is challenging, but thats why i like it. Very good app. I really recommend it!
B0035WTJFW|4.0|More of a question than a review. Does this most recent blu-ray release come with a digital copy? I love this movie and want to add it to my blu-ray collection. At the same time I'm also trying to build my digital library. So it would be very helpful if someone could let me know if a digital copy is included.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|gets me up in the morning ' very cool.  I love it don't use any thing else just this. awesome
B009E3EY38|5.0|As a long time fan I must admit that I was not sure what to expect after so many years and after some not so great previous &#34;reunions&#34; of some of the original members of Led Zeppelin. But this show completely blew me away. The 3 original members, Page, Plant and Jones, all deserve credit for great performances. Jason Bonham on drums was the only way to do this show. A great set list, a great performance, awesome show!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I ordered my copy the first day it was available for preorder - stupidly assuming that the company would ship on or about release date. I checked the order this morning and they aren't bothering to ship it until next effing week! I think the most appropriate term I can apply to this transaction is epic fail. What is the point of ordering early? For a $2 savings? So underwhelming.<br /><br />The movie, however, is great. Critics who dismiss it for the lack of Damon's participation are missing out on a really fun ride. I'm a Renner fan, so he could read the phone book for 2 hours and I would still be thrilled. I read an article where Damon poo-pooed the movie because of the focus on drugs and where could they possibly take the franchise after this? Any-bleeping-where they choose because they're not hamstrung by a whiny operative lamenting over his identity and once found, then what? Whining about how they keep coming after him? Sounds like sour grapes over a film that delivered just as much enjoyable entertainment and a more relatable hero as all three of his combined.
B009AZZ6H8|5.0|Awesome, Soundgarden is back. It's great to hear these guys back together. The more I listen, the more I enjoy it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|fun to see where you are at on your battery life. Easy to download and for free Go and download the app and have fun.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is terrific!  It makes you use your head to figure out the clues and collect artifacts.  My six year old loved it as well!
068817776X|5.0|While this woman did not endure the hardship of one of the death camps she did endure the psychological, emotional and physical hardships of losing her family and being completely unsure of anything in her life.  At any moment her identity could have been found out and she lived to tell the story.  It's a fascinating yet very sad view of the entire era that she lived.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in that time in history.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The price of what this cost makes this a great deal. I seen some people were complaining about not having extras, nice collectors cases,etc.  That's also why your not paying much. Who has time for 10hrs of directors opinions anyways? It's not like this is Lord of The Rings or anything.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|This movie was not nearly as good as the hype. I felt like it was very short and cheesy and lacked the adult disney humor in their older movies -- that let adults enjoy them as much as the kids do!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very exciting story and it show you the human complexity and love and sorrow. Recommended for any one and for any age
B001LOU8ME|5.0|This is a great live album, from the hey-day of live albums.  This line up includes Michael (of course), Cozy Powell, Paul Raymond (also ex-ufo), Chris Glen, and Gary Barden.  Michael's playing is excellent...the whole band rocks...and this package includes bonus material, like Cozy's drum solo.  Awesome stuff.
B006LR0XLM|2.0|I couldn't find this nor the gotomeeting app in the Amazon app store as prior yet they claim it is available on the web  i even tried downloading from the web but no go. This is like false advertisement.please fix!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought a cd for our family and two as gifts for this holiday season.  My 10 year old (cello player) listens to it all the time in the truck on the way to school and I love the twist on these already great songs.  Amazing cd. Thanks piano guys!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Action from start to finish, though I do believe information about missions that should be in secret still should always remain secret but since the Obama Administration already develged information already. It doesn't matter. This guy and the ones that did this mission did an amazing job and its amazing what they go through on a regular bases doing missions that we will never ever know about.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those that want to know about DEVGRU, SEALS, and the Special Operations Command in general.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like how it tell me the power level in any color I want. I also like how it tells you the power level depending on how your using the tablet: reading, web, music, movies...etc.
B002VCR03A|3.0|this is my first from this author..I didn't like this book much mostly because of its pace and grasp of graphics...the story moved too slow for my liking..very stretchy...and secondly all the climax was very short..when the moment for the author came to fill in her words and put in the fight scenes..they did not happen at all and the book came abruptly to an end...I assumed that Leck would have been better prepared since all the kingdoms new the strengths of Katsa's grace...it was a boring climax...I would not recommend this book if you are an action lover..
1400052181|5.0|I was very surprised when this book came up on our book club reading list.  Could not put it down.  Quite a fascinating read and the author did an amazing job of including every aspect of this woman's story....medical, personal, financial, emotional aspects of what this family dealt with.  Read like a novel, but was accurate in every detail.  Loved it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|OK its December and im seeing complaints about the newsfeed back in October and it STILL isnt fixed??!! Come on now...
B005M61PGA|2.0|Love the voice as always, but the songs don't move me like her earlier cd's.  I was expecting this cd to knock my socks off based on the hype before its release but not even close. Not worth the money.  I recommend it only because it is Katie Melua, after all,  and you don't mind overspending to complete your collection.
B005LAII94|4.0|[[ASIN:B00A6N8F4Y Savages]] is a film about two successful Laguna Beach, CA marijuana dealers that are amongst the top of the business. In addition, they are friends from High School. Ben, played by Aaron Johnston, is a Buddhist, incredibly giving, and the more gentle of the best friends. Chon, played by Taylor Kitsch, is the more outspoken and hard-nosed of the two, amplified by his background in the war as a Navy Seal.  Both best friends/dealers share one girlfriend, O (Blake Lively), who ends up playing a pivotal role in the plot. O, in addition, serves as the narrator throughout the 130 minute film.<br /><br />Things grow awry for the Laguna Beach boys when the Mexican drug cartel wants to be a part of  their lucrative business. The cartel assert their corrupt power and authority by holding O hostage until Ben and Chon meet their demands. O is the most important facet of either of Ben or Chon's life, so they know they must devise means to save their beloved. Using both Elena (Salma Hayek), the top of the cartel, and her no. 2 Lado's (Benicio Del Toro) thinking against them with the help of a corrupt DEA Agent (John Travolta), Ben and Chon end up rescuing their mutual gal-pal.<br /><br />The film was one I highly anticipated seeing, but failed to grace my hometown.  After viewing, it was not a film I would envision Oliver Stone directing, but I was pleasantly surprised as the film was better than I expected it to be.  The film is 'savage' itself in many ways, give prominence of sexual situations, substance use, and violence/gore. Perhaps it is the plot and some of the plot's savagery that leaves some room for criticism, particularly given some of the mixed reviews on amazon.com in particular.  It is not a crime film for the faint of heart as the graphic nature will turn off many. Quibbles and nitpicking aside, all-in-all, [[ASIN:B00A6N8F4Y Savages]] is worth watching and I would gladly view it more than once.

B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Bruno Mars anticipated sophomore album Unorthodox Jukebox follows 2010's Doo-Wops & Hooligans.  At only 35 minutes, Mars oscillates between musical styles pushing the envelope during that short duration. Many of the experiments work well while some are fine attempts that fall short. Flaws aside, Mars has grown more confident as a vocalist. His soulful vocals atone for any miscues showing the mark of true musicianship. Although flawed at times, Unorthodox Jukebox yields more than enough bright spots to please.<br /><br />\\"Young Girls\\" opens with bright production even as Mars sings about his vice of `women.' \\"All you young, wild girls,\\" he sings both dramatically and ambivalently \\"...you'll be the death of me...\\" \\"Young Girls\\" is solid start to Unorthodox Jukebox finding Mars's voice laden with emotion.<br /><br />\\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\" is lifted from the hangover of \\"Young Girls\\" and its own success as the effort's promo single.  An `in-the-pocket' groove established from the top of this cut is nothing short of addictive. The production is solid; balanced, the cut never feels under- or over-produced.  Solid songwriting  (\\"cause you make me feel like, I've been locked out of heaven/for too long, for too long...\\") and a strong vocal performance from Mars puts \\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\" over the top.<br /><br />\\"Gorilla\\" shocks, epitomizing the cut most warranting a parental advisory label. \\"Gorilla\\" makes a bold analogy, though it doesn't completely work successfully ultimately. Giving the R. Kelly a run for his money on this risqu&eacute; cut, Mars deserves credit for his ambition and shock-ability. The cut nearly works, but falls shy of its mark.<br /><br />\\"Treasure\\" atones for a bold \\"Gorilla\\" rewinding back to the neo-soul days. Mars likens his lover to `treasure' whether it be in noun, verb, or adjective form: \\"Treasure, that means what you are/honey you're my golden star/I know you can make my wish come true/if you let me treasure you...\\" Bruno's chivalrous songwriting and performance on \\"Treasure\\" serves as antithesis to \\"Gorilla.\\"<br /><br />On \\"Moonshine\\" Mars embraces pop/rock crossover, given an 1980s sound cultivated by the production. As always, a big chorus unifies the cut soundly enough. The song ends up being solid, though not the album's most exceptional showing.  Mars embraces stripped production (piano accompaniment) on \\"When I Was Your Man,\\" contrasting \\"Moonshine's\\" busier production work. Vocally, Mars is soulful and quite commanding as he sings about his ex \\"dancing with another man.\\"<br /><br />\\"Natalie\\" is a marginal `shock' compared to \\"Gorilla.\\" Here, Mars brags about \\"digging a ditch...\\" for a gold digger and gets dramatic on memorable lines like \\"I spend your lifetime in jail/I'll be smiling in my cell...\\" On the bridge, he introspects what the audience can predictably fill-in: \\"I should've know better cause when we were together she never said forever/I'm a fool that played in her game...\\" \\"Natalie\\" is creative, if nothing else.<br /><br />\\"Show Me,\\" one of the album's more indulgent cuts, finds Mars switching to reggae.  While it marks a stark contrast to \\"Natalie,\\" the cut is overly `affected' in the tropical style, particularly where production is concerned.  \\"Money Make Her Smile\\"  atones for the misstep, sporting some of the efforts strongest production work. Mars remains strong vocally and resolute within his performance: \\"It's not that complicated, so this won't take a while/you see money make her dance and money, money, money maker her smile.\\" Little quibbles here.<br /><br />Retro-soul closer \\"If I Knew\\" finds a forward-thinking Mars rewinding back in time, though by no means anachronistically. By the end, the bass and drums drop out and Mars is only accompanied by electric guitar.  This stripped nature further only elevates the Mars's soulful, gritty vocal performance.<br /><br />All-in-all, there are many positive moments showcased on Unorthodox Jukebox.  It is not the definitive pop or R&Balbum of 2012, but there are plenty musical moments cultivated on this effort to appreciate. Alongside those more triumphant moments, there are also flaws, many of which lie in the lack of cohesion that is Unorthodox Jukebox. That said, it wasn't named that title for no reason, and even that `coverage' serves as some atonement for impropriety. Maybe not touch down, but minimally a field goal. 3 ½ stars.of 2012, but there are plenty musical moments cultivated on this effort to appreciate.

B005PK1G76|4.0|Good stroller organizer. plenty space for bottles, cell phone, snack box, etc. the strip is sturdy and easy rape around the stroller hand held area. Use it every time when I have a walk with my baby..
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I heard a lot of negative things about this, but I was fully engaged through about 96%of it. It did go on a bit, but McEwan can carry that off. He's a pro!
B000SE0OYA|5.0|The toners are perfect.  No spillage and they set off the notification of flashing lights and let me know when the toners need to be replaced (many of the generic or refills do not).  I'm very pleased with these toners... I need reliable toners since I do weekly Church bulletins (300 copies).
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I don't know why I love this. I am 63 and should know better. It's a challenge I guess. Who doesn't love Star Wars.

0061900656|5.0|I purchased this book for my nephew, who is about to become a big brother in a few short weeks.  I have not read it to him or seen him read it yet, but I read through it and think he will like it very much.  The story is very sweet and the illustrations are adorable.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A great laugh!  A &#34;curl up on the couch&#34; with popcorn and a few good friends to feel good movie - loved it!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I loved Christopher Nolan's entire Dark Knight Trilogy, and found this to be a worthy follow-up to The Dark Knight.  Granted, no superhero movie will probably ever touch The Dark Knight.  But DKR is a fun watch and I loved the addition of Joseph Gordon Levitt :)
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This a wonderful story. I enjoy Richard Ford's writing (Bascomb trilogy, etc), but the writing in \\"Canada\\" is special with the story being told through the young boy.

However, these three always make me feel the gift of giving, love and peace in my heart.<br /><br />Miracle on 34th Street also reminds me that at one time when I was young people still cared about their fellow man if only at Christmas time.  It is my all time feel good movie.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I couldn't get past the first few pages. There just didn't seem to be any point to the story, if you can call it a story. Maybe it's like Moby Dick, and it gets better after trudging through the first 200 pages. I was going to go see the movie; based on the few pages I read of the book, now I'm not.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Tired of Kiera Knightly starring in everything lately.  Otherwise, the story was good and the huntsman, of course, was great.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|The view into the WWI era is quite fascinating, but the story moves slowly. It's an easy book to put down. Not as engaging as Pillars of the Earth.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Acting was good, it dragged a few times during the chasing and fighting scenes, got a little tired of it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Listening (and watching) The Piano Guys just makes me happy!  :)  The mixture of creativity, talent and humor make them so fun to watch and listen to.  They are mesmerizing!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and entertaining game.  Always challenging. Played at home by everyone in our smartphones and tablets. It would be nice to open up to new routes
B009K916ZK|5.0|It takes a little DisplayPort on a Mac Mini and provides an interface to connect a standard VGA monitor to it.  I used it to connect our Mac Mini to an older 19 inch LCD monitor (5x4 aspect ratio) and didn't have any issues.<br /><br />I bought the genuine Apple model since I had read a few reviews about the off-brand units not quite measuring up as far as quality and compatibility were concerned.  Knowing Apple, I don't find it hard to believe,<br /><br />Otherwise, this little adapter works fine and I can't find any reason not to recommend it to others.
B007G5K066|4.0|I have no clue about the movie when I started watching it. I've never read the book either. It was slow. But as the movies goes it became interesting. I finally understood what it was when the movie ended. Now I have the need to watch it again and enjoy every little moments. I believe it will be better second time around. But I enjoyed the first time also. Excellent casts doesn't hurt either.
B009GED3HS|1.0|After bouncing back last season from a slump that had been going on too long, this is a return to overly broad humor and poor characterization that has been the shows biggest problem.
B0081BU42O|5.0|but like all of Iain M. Banks' 'culture' novels, it's funny, deep, thought provoking, sexy, and action packed.  This guy is my all time favorite sci-fi writer, and his twin brother Ian Banks is my all time favorite fiction author.<br /><br />Update:  I finished the book, the ending is quite action-packed, and the ultimate conclusion is satisfying.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for a co-woker...She loved it...I have it also.  Disc is perfect.  Thank you.
B0086449YA|5.0|I was not aware of this artist, but after listening to samples of the music on amazon.com, I knew my sister would love it as a birthday gift.  And she did.  She was very happy to receive it, and I know she will enjoy many hours of listening.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is an absolute must-see for zombie lovers. This series has one many awards and really sucks you in. I have no complaints here. It's worth buying on Amazon because you will spend more on it at any other store. Never had a DVD arrive in less than perfect condition from any Amazon seller.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|My sister was more than elated to receive this CD package for her birthday.  I am not aware of the band, but after listening to samples of their music on amazon.com, I knew my sister would love it.  And she did!!!
0307719774|5.0|This product is so cute. It is small like other reviewers said but I don't mind that at all. I'm going to start writing in it on the first of the year! Purchased an extra one for my cousin in college.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was very excited about this album coming out. The Piano Guys make incredible music. I did get their \\"Hits Vol. 1\\" album before I got this, however, and the two albums do have about half a dozen songs in common. Even so, they are inspiring songs, especially if it is your first exposure to these great artists. I was impressed by the newer songs, especially \\"What Makes You Beautiful.\\" They definitely make this song their own here. I can't describe them any better than they describe themselves: they like to put \\"a classic spin on new things, and a new spin on classic things.\\"
B000F8O35U|5.0|I had a great experience ordering this product and watching the movie they shipped it actually two days earlier than promised...
B008ENA74E|3.0|The book is interesting, but not well written (no book of 288 pages should have the word \\"surreal\\" in it at least 5 times).<br /><br />Also, it begs for more information on the aftermath of Mr. Smith's departure - what happened to Mr. Smith and what, if anything, happened to the principal players at Goldman.<br /><br />Perhaps he held that part of the story back for a subsequent book.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Works just fine. Would be nice to have a feature that permits labeling a task as ongoing/daily, so that it could be automatically populated into the &#34;today&#34; list.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Without any reservations I recommend this DVD set to anyone who want to see the power and majesty of the greatest band ever. Yes I am a fan for over 40 years and have seen LZ 11 times at the LA Forum 73-77. I have owned hundreds of boots too but this show moved me in a unique way. No need to review the set list it flows extremely well, just buy and enjoy
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Denzel Washington is excellent regardless of the movie and he fits the role of Eli to a Tee. I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of the movie and anticipated the end. However, I missed it and the ending was a pleasant surprise.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|It is an amazing film. Full of creativity and special ways to tell a story.<br />I thing that this movie is a piece of art, very well done with humor and romance.<br />I really enjoy myself watching it.
B004N66XYE|5.0|I am forever amazed at the quality of the television programs coming out of England. Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs are two great programs. I am now starting to buy other programs with the same result - superb programs that are a delight to watch!
159420411X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I believe it is a very insightful text on why forecasting is difficult, and what are the biggest challenges of doing it right. I particularly enjoyed the weather forecasting chapter and the piece that gives a non-technical introduction to the Bayesian approach to probabilistic thinking. If anything, the book would have benefited from a more elaborate numerical example of refining forecasts using Bayesian updating, but perhaps that's just my geeky side talking.
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|Bruno mars  has some talent,  however he is  basically a music making karoke machine. if he wants to channel a  hint of the 60's its there with a wink to a James Brown or Jackie Wilson or Elvis Presley.  or in the 80's  with  Michael Jackson,Prince,Bobby Brown, George Michael,the police and Sting. or in the 90's with R.Kelly, and a  few others.  its  cool and cute, but after a while it gets predictable and boring  because the cat has no idenity of his own and the songs while polished and formula driven, lack an ounce of a original vibe or pressence and it tends to leave alot to desired. he has well produced songs as to him being a  good songwriter. production is key and  he uses it to his advantage.  problem for ears of mine is that i have heard this song and  dance before and by better cats who could hybrid there influences and also cover there tracks a bit better.<br /><br />Mars is basically an instrumental music making version of puffy or basically following the lenny Kravitz blueprint of covering the buffett of all you like and sponge and never being accountable for being original.<br /><br />Mars to me will be more remembered as a songwriter and producer on other acts than his ownself and that is one jukebox that will keep the checks coming in, meanwhile the songs will 9 times out of 10 sound like somebody else you dug  3 times better the first time around.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an exceptional book and an even better story. From the first page to the last, the drive to keep turning them, to get the answers you were looking for(wether they were good and happy or tragic) I just couldn't put this book down I loved it!  Usually in books and stories like this my mind is always jumping to the next twist, the anticipation and success of figuring it out before it happens, is like an internal game.  But something about this one just had me flowing with it, much like the characters I was a boat with out a sail following a current with only a drive to know guiding me. I think that is due to the simplicity of the writing, not insulting, I'm praising the fact that it's just simply written well. From the first page and first steps taken on the stairs to last page on those same stairs. The details, literary details were never over embellished they were honest and good. Once described, I was in the silo I knew the silo, I was a part of the silo.  I recommend everyone, wether you're a fan of this genre or not to read this series.  Normally I don't reference parts of the book in detail because I hate when I read a spoiler, but I promise this isn't a spoiler. When the author explores the meaning reasoning and basic existence of dead pixels in a screen, I was blown away at how subtle yet philosophically poignant that was, to me those few pages sealed my love for this book.
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|Christina  Aguilera  is one  of  those talents where i keep  expecting her to  go full  Etta James and expect a classic song or albums, etc. instead of getting her doing corny 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from  lightweight acts. hearing an  album like  this  shows me how desperate  she is to be accepted as to making an artistic  statement.  she has the kind of voice that should be running things and easily showcasing her skills with far better material. autotone,and this  voice don't go. she is more known for being a judge on the  voice than this corny material she is pushing out.she outta be doing a Linda Ronstadt  as to trying to compete with Rihanna. Xtina is better than this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A great continuation of book 1.  . .  an imaginative view on how life could be if we continue on in the socialistic way we're going.<br />Very easy to read . . . and kept me enthralled and wanting to keep ready.
B00006HBUB|1.0|The dvd did not work!!!!!!! !! !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! !! ! ! !!! !! !!! !!! !!!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|This is truly an awesome musical && story...once you see it you will want to see it again and again!
B000ICXQF6|4.0|It was a very good movie - I have seen it before and it was nice to just be able to watch it again!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|It was a gift for my best friend.  We share a love of the movie and she was surprised and loved it.  Thanks.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Another awesome book by Agatha Christie with twists and turns galore with a surprising major one in the end. It had it all--a tennis player/dancer, inn worker, handicapped man with lots of money and heirs, some old friends of Miss Marple's who find a dead body in their library. It takes Miss Marple, 2 or 3 policemen and a retired Scotland Yard man to solve it.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Works beautifully.  Just ignore any rebate offers from Gigabyte.  Once you've purchased the product, the company feels no obligation to honor its rebate pledge.  Don't waste your time.
076790592X|5.0|I have read this book several times, and my adult daughter has not read it, so I bought it for a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  It is the perfect gift, and one that you can read and reread  over the years.<br />As with everything you order from Amazon, it arrives promptly and in great condition.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you are fan of the classic Harry Bosch genre, this is a good read. Interesting prologue to set the stage for the current case, all in all I found it very enjoyable.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is a very good app. it is amazing. it is awesome. I like the graphics and i like the horses.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The characters in this book are delightful with slapstick scenes and the story unfolds to a conclusion that<br />made me cheer for the good guys....whoever they were.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like flow free because its not to easy it can get really hard but that's your choice so I guess you should get it.  but thats my opinion.
B005H0IW76|5.0|Of course I love Michael Buble but his Xmas cd was exceptional .  I bought two one for a gift.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|What can be said about the original John Carpenter's Halloween that hasn't been said already? The Blu ray version is cleaned up and looks great. The bonus features are almost as cool as the movie. In my opinion, John Carpenter does the BEST audio commentary. I complete but never boring breakdown of each scene: How it was filmed, little mistakes that are hidden.<br />The best part is, you can hear the BEST horror soundtrack in DTS! Turn the lights out and turn the sound up'
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This was bought as a christmas gift for my son and it came fast and in good shape and i know he will enjoy
B003F3PMYI|2.0|Loved the message but felt it had a bit too much fluff for its content. Lot of academic example, would have loved a few more out-in-the-market cases.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|One of the reasons that I wanted to read this book was to compare it to the movies of the same title. I found some similarities and some differences and very much enjoyed the search for both.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm aware that I'm prob to old to be playing this (14) but its just so much fun! I downloaded it on my kindle fire and there's no problem except when I'm not connected to wifi the mini games run a bit slow :)
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The app works pretty good on my HD7.  I'm a first time tablet owner and I learned a lot by reading the free [[ASIN:B00AL92NOG Camera Visual Guide (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] but I think it should be free like others say.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is a classic at my house. Will Ferrell's innocence and enthusiasm are very endearing a not a little bit infectious.
0345522478|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:B00A6VAPCQ Borne of Mist (Mistborn Chronicles)]] & [[ASIN:B00722UOPK Calling Down the Wind (Elementals)]], I'm always foraging for a good read. This first book in a modern Druid's adventures in Arizona satisfies. My favorite character? Oberon the Irish Wolfhound, who's nearly as dear to me as my own hounds and every bit as good a conversationalist.<br /><br />Of course, Hearn chose a great protagonist to carry this series. Twenty-one something Atticus, the Druid in question, keeps both wit and sword sharp--to this reader's delight. Throw in rising conflicts between a mixed pantheon of gods along with the usual suspects of urban fantasy, and I can't wait to read his next one--and the one after that. Best of all? Hearns writes well and keeps the story elements aligned and galloping forward. This proved such a romp--for which I give thanks.
