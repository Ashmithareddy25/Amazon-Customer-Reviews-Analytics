0765325950|3.0|---  tl/dr - It's flawed, but better than nothing. You should buy it, but don't expect perfection.  ---  There were rumours, when Jordan died. Some said he left extensive notes, which his widow could give to a new author. Some said he left nothing except the instruction to let his series die with him, unfinished. After reading this, the final book, I honestly don't know which rumours were true, but in any case, I doubt this creation was what Jordan had wanted. It is riddled with problems:  1) In his first attempt at Jordan's world, the ill-named &#34;The Gathering Storm&#34;, Sanderson very often failed to capture the voices of many of the characters, most of all Perrin and Mat. It read like a fan-fiction sometimes. In this book, one rarely comes across the same problem. However, it is still off sometimes, and one's immersion slips every time it happens.  2) I have a hard time imagining that Jordan's carefully built plot would culminate in so many moments that were not exactly &#34;Deus ex Machina&#34;, but were so contrived as to feel almost the same. The ending is the very worst of these. And what's even worse is that so many of these occurrences are not entirely explained to us, while we read. We're just told that they happen, and are left to accept them.  3) The lack of explanation doesn't stop at large events, and even trickles down to the small details. Rand &#34;does something with the one power&#34;. He does &#34;SOMETHING&#34;? Maybe if we're seeing things from the point of view of another character, one that cannot see weaves. Then it would be a dramatic device. But that's rarely the case. Too often there's a lack of detail which I supposed could be explained by a desire for brevity... or at least, I hope that's what it was. The alternative would be a lack of caring on the part of the author, and I really don't want to think that.  4) Still on the matter of writing - The author's presumed desire for bevity clashes very often with a different recurring problem - His infatuation with similes. EVERYTHING is a simile to this man! Everything is like *insert something florid, usually involving some made up word, here*. A person can't just reach out and grab someone, passionately, or desparately, or off-handedly, or indifferently. He has to reach out and grab him like... &#34;a bear reaching for a fleeting fish in a crystal clear bubbling brook&#34;. It really is tiring.  5) An extension of his insistence on florid over-complicated similies is his insistence on squeezing made up words into EVERYTHING. Jordan had some regular plants, regular animals, regular birds. Sanderson seems to have never heard of them. It's as if he thinks the story is happening on another planet or something. And what's worse is that he sucks at inventing these made up words. Where Jordan could make the old tongue appear lovely and almost real, in Sanderson's hands it feels like the made up baby-talk of someone with a bad cough. He just does NOT know how to use it, and it grates while you read. Oh boy, does it grate.  And finally... Not to give too much away, but the ending blows. There's no sense of closure. No real sense of leaving things done. When the book ended, I actually found myself flipping back and forth and going &#34;WHAT? Is that it??&#34;. It desperately needed an epilogue, and there was none to be had. Everything else I could excuse, but that was the worst problem of all - that a series like this should end on note like &#34;Is that it??&#34; is a shame beyond description.  However... Even though it was hugely flawed, even though it was annoying beyond words, I'm glad I read it and I'm grateful to that talentless hack, Sanderson, for writing it.  If you were unfortunate enough to have fallen in love with the WoT series while there was still hope for it to end under Jordan's guidance, if you can't go away without an ending, this ending is better than what you would otherwise have gotten, and it is MUCH better than no ending at all. I would recommend buying this book.  To use an image which I'm sure Sanderson would approve of, in form though probably not in substance: This book and its two even lesser siblings are as flawed as the patch that covered the Bore. The more you poke at them, the more they fall apart, but hell, it's better than if there was nothing there.
B00332CWLW|5.0|A friend recommended this book, and though I love Irish writers such as Colm Toibin and William Trevor, I did not know about Colum McCann. Now I plan to read everything he's written. This is a wonderful, multi-layered book. It takes many stories and weaves them into a very satisfying whole, the only linking factor being the famous Twin Towers tightrope walk by Philippe Petit. I could not bear to put the book down, and read it in every spare minute. The quality of the writing is superb, often lyrical, and McCann brilliantly captures the voices of a cast of very diverse people. Above all it is a great book about New York, a city I knew well during the period in which the stories are set.
B007F0IXD4|5.0|I love the book, and I love everything Gaiman so I can hardly give you a fair and unbiased review outside of me telling you that it's brilliant! I'm actually reviewing the 10th anniversary Kindle edition, and just for the fact of it being  $1.99 how could you not buy this?
0312966199|5.0|I'm just so amazed that I'm loving Herriot's books so much. Never did I think that I, at age 66, would be loving animal stories so much, farm animals in particular. And Herriot feels like a friend now. I feel as though I'm right there with him at the farms in the English countryside. I'm rooting for him when he's treating these sick animals or helping with the birthing of animals. There are also some domestic animals in this book--dogs, cats, and birds. I love all the stories. The stories which are the most interesting to me involve both an animal and Herriot. Reading about cowboys who lasso animals isn't interesting to me. I find that I'm losing the gist of the story--who's he talking about? The cowboy? The steer? The pig? And do I care? But when those middle-of-the-night calls bring Herriot out to those farms where he must make life and death decisions for the farm owners and miracles can occur, then I can engage in the story and my world disappears. For the moment, I'm Herriot and I want nothing more than to see this calf born or cow healed. I love hearing about some of the people--particularly the kind and caring ones. Some of the selfish ones who avoid paying their vet bills anger me. I want to say--\\"Keep warming my heart, Herriot, with the bright and the beautiful; I wish I didn't have to think about the pettiness of people. Let me just get lost in your world of medicine and four-legged and feathered friends. It's a welcome respite from the world.\\"
B00FFHG6KQ|2.0|This game really started to agitate me when the settings kept messing up. I'd set them on rookie and they'd play like hall of famers. It would be been a acceptable if it was a free game, but it wasn't. I don't recommend this game to people who like graphic games.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I love Community. It's a great ensemble of very different people who somehow click perfectly. This show is very, very silly, but the stories and the characters are intricately connected. From the pilot on, I cared about these people and wanted to see more of their damaged lives in this ridiculous school. And I don't think the show would be the same without the Jeff speeches. Brilliant. And the Troy and Abed relationship is priceless. After a friend bugged me to watch Community, I watched the first three seasons in 10 days. I couldn't get enough of it. I bought the first three seasons three times: For myself, and for gifts for my friend and my son.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The app is 1.5 gigs but kindle fire can only hold 1.1 gigs in apps. So it is impossible to download on to your kindle which doesn't make any sense for a kindle app. This seriously needs to be fixed.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read, I am so glad I did not purchase the entire series... trying to make it through this book was physically painful. I liked the characters, and although the plot was underdeveloped and extremely predictable it would have been alright if it weren't for the horrible writing style. Clearly I am no novelist, but I have read my fair share of Young Adult Literature and feel compelled to let you know that in comparison to other YA novels available this one is complete crap. Again it was not the storyline or characters that I found absolutely foul, but the writing. The authors attempts at creating vivid sensory experiences can only be describes as an \\"epic fail.\\" I don't know what it is about her use of similes, but they really annoyed me. I have included a few of my least favorite to give you an idea of what I am talking about, \\"...the scent hit Clary, soft as the padded blow of a cats paw\\" or \\"she could see the lights of Manhattan burning like cold jewels.\\" Burning like cold jewels... really? The scent hit her softly... not for me. The book is full of unoriginal/boring/clich&eacute; descriptions/comparison like these. I will not be reading any more of her books.<br /><br />If you need a good YA novel to read, try Kresley Coles Arcana Chronicles - start with Poison Princess. She has an entertaining writing style that I thoroughly enjoy. You can even try it out for free...

B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I watched his movie after reading how many people liked it and how \\"awesome\\" it was. Even terms like \\"brilliant\\", \\"great\\" and \\"epic\\" came up. I usually take these kinds of enthusiastic reviews with a grain of salt but my expectations had been high nonetheless. So I tried sitting through the whole screen time. But I just couldn't and left the theater after 30 minutes. A \\"Transformers vs. Godzilla\\" style flick really can't be taken serious lest considered to be entertaining. I was bored out of my mind and was constantly laughing because the movie is just so ridiculous. Maybe it's great fun for kids to watch but I'm definitely way past my teenager years to be able to enjoy dull, uninspired battles between huge, clumsy robots and huge, clumsy alien-dinosaurs. Even the CGI-effects couldn't make a difference. Pacific Rim has decent effects but it's just an over-hyped B-movie with a poor story and wooden acting. Monstrous aliens had been the main theme for cheap horror flicks in the 80's. I'm surprised someone's actually bothering enough to give them a comeback. It even looked as if the studio went back to putting people into foam + rubber suits to play the monsters - just like those old Godzilla movies.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I have two of BOB HEIL'S microphones designed specifically for amateur radio use; one of these Heil microphones cost $71.00 and the other $187.00 and when compared to this $25.00 microphone in ON THE AIR TESTING ......... not ONE ....... I repeat ..... NOT ONE reception report came back giving the edge to the &#34;Heil' microphone over this microphone!  They were equal in every respect!<br /><br />THE ONLY PLACE where I could find a difference -- and it can be somewhat important in some circumstances -- is REAR FIELD REJECTION is VERY VERY SLIGHTLY WIDER on the &#34;Heil&#34; -- NOT A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE in my circumstances.  Again - in MY circumstances it DID NOT create a problem and I rate this microphone as being 95% the equally if not higher when compared to the &#34;Heil&#34;.<br /><br />If you are looking for a SUPERB microphone for AMATEUR RADIO USE (verify it will work on YOUR rig of course!) this is a SUPERB alternative to Bob Heil's SPECIALTY LINE designed for amateurs. DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR you will receive a great on-the-air microphone that will rival ANY microphone hyped by Bob Heil.  Sorry Bob - but it IS true!

I found it difficult to take his role seriously and his acting left a little to be desired but afterall he is young and learning. Storyline predictable. It was all about Jaden getting his feet wet and experienced to follow in his father's foot steps both on and off screen.

Like any sensible person who believes they've taken up residence in a haunted house, they move. Right! Wrong! So the ghosts pack their bags and move with them. Oh great more guests! Then comes the geeky pair of paranormal investigators. So we finally get to the answer of what is causing the coma the ghosts what the boy. Gee I never figured that was coming. Did you?  His astral projection and his spirit has left his body without really knowing it's gone. If he doesn't come back soon he'll be lost forever, taken by the strongest of the creepy phantoms, a blood-red fiend who provides the most terrifying moments. It turns out that Dalton inherited his gift from Dad, who has repressed his own childhood encounters with out-of-body flight, but must revisit the dark limbo where all the specters lurk in order to reunite his son's body and soul and this is all done by the kids birthday. So that's all I'm going to tell you and you must see the picture but all in all it's a great picture.

B008SOS63S|5.0|Why 5 stars?  Because Joe Bonamassa is out of this world!<br />He has other guests joining him on this dual-disc set (You will  have to buy it to find out who they are.), but there is no doubt that Joe is the best, and this set of CDs will let you hear every note of this young man's (33 years old, I think) genius.  Some of the cuts on these 2 CDs you may not like, but there will be others that you'll love, and you'll play them over and over again.  Joe plays guitar like a Master and sings like a modern-day angel.<br /><br />I'm not musically trained myself, nor do I play an instrument, so I can't give you a detailed technical critique. But my big Italian family (who claim Joe as one of our own) has and still does include many musicians, among whom there were several guitar players and singers (My father was one).  They're Bonamassa fans too.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A heart wrenching read and so difficult to swallow the reality of the situation.  When we see a lion pounce on a helpless gazelle and think how awful,  but that's what makes them animals.  Perhaps we should look to the atrocities we humans commit on our own kind.  When will it ever be time for mankind to treat each other with love and respect, for without it we are far worse than animals because we have the intelligence to know better.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|What can I say after reviewing &#34;Bonamassa - Live at the Beacon?&#34;  Read that review and apply it to this CD.  I'm crazy about J.B., and you will be too (assuming you like good, loud and some not so loud, boisterous blues, jazz, and rock with a beat).  &#34;Dust Bowl&#34; gives you 12 tracks of good music--12 tracks!--and you'll love every one of them.  If you have never heard Joe play guitar and sing in person in New York (Where else would he go live to thousands first?) or on public television, you've got to buy and play this CD before you listen to &#34;...Live...&#34;  Joe's unique style makes his music sound incredible; you'll find yourself listening to it all the time.<br /><br />P.S. To the ladies out there:  He is really cute and sexy too. (Bet Amazon will delete this line.)

0061950726|4.0|I  liked the history behind this wonderful read.  I had never heard of the orphan trains until I read this book.  The story is wonderfully written and I loved the author's pictures and synopsis of the historical aspects of this time in our history.  Having taught Kindergarten for many years, I found it so hard to comprehend the fear and loneliness these children must have endured.  The book also demonstrates the resiliency of the human spirit against such tragic odds.
B00E8KC5HY|5.0|Rene Jacobs surely has his detractors, chiefly when he conducts works from the Classical period (most of the controversy centers around his recordings of Mozart). Listeners will find him either revelatory or sacrilegious--I belong to the former camp, though criticisms are certainly not without merit. If his work with Mozart seemed off-putting, fussy, or frantic, rest assured that such problems are not found here. Jacobs, indeed, built his reputation on conducting Baroque. With Bach's St. Matthew Passion, Rene Jacobs has returned to his element. Recall his brilliant early recording of Bach's Christmas Oratorio for Harmonia Mundi, secular cantatas, and motets. This recording is interpreted in the same vein: solemn but forward-thrusting, reflective but dramatic. It is just the right mix that puts this record in the same league, or perhaps in a league above, longtime favorites such as Herreweghe's, Gardiner's, or Br&uuml;ggen's. It is one of those special St. Matthew's that can bring even an irreligious man like myself to his feet.<br /><br />Jacobs, ever the iconoclast, attempts to bring listeners closer to the sound world that Bach would have known. The result is a breathtaking experience in which Harmonia Mundi's sound managers work with Jacobs to create an uncanny sense of space. Bach's St. Matthew Passion, after all, is a monumental work requiring two choirs and two orchestras. Essentially, the Passion belongs to the \\"dialogue cantata\\" tradition (think about the dialogue aria in \\"Wachet auf,\\" BWV140), where a central feature is two soloists `speaking' to one another. Bach augmented the idea for Leipzig's Good Friday services by having two choirs in dialogue with one another. Of course, this presents difficulties. We know that the St. Thomas Church in Bach's day had two choir lofts: the larger, main loft toward the rear, and the smaller loft up front above the altar. Due to the circumstantial evidence we have left (e.g. the removal of the smaller loft's organ and reorchestations--see Christoph Wolff's book, \\"Bach, the Learned Musician\\" for more details) we can infer that the first ensemble was in the rear loft and the second was up front. Today with our sound recordings, we typically hear the first ensemble in our left speakers, and the second ensemble in the right. This recording, however, is engineered to put the first ensemble \\"behind\\" you, and the second \\"in front.\\" Listen to the famous opening number, and picture yourself sitting toward the rear of the church facing the altar. You may notice the second choir and its soloists sound more distant; soloists from the second ensemble sound as though they're singing from a distance. This may take getting used to, but this probably replicates Bach's intention of exploiting the acoustics of St. Thomas Church as they existed on a Good Friday in the 1720s-1740s. Listen to a turba chorus with prominent double-chorus writing like \\"Weissage uns,\\" and note the effect of separating the choirs out in a larger space; one truly gets a sense of Bach at his innovative best. This aim at acoustic accuracy is a feature that makes this recording truly special.<br /><br />The Akademie f&uuml;r Alte Musik-Berlin plays with clarity and liveliness. There is a certain pulse, especially in the full-sounding, expressive bass section, that keeps the tragic plot moving forward while remaining solemn. The RIAS Kammerchor likewise sings their parts sensitivity to the text: turba choruses are dramatic, as if they were from a Rameau tragic opera, supplementing the powerful narrative forces of Wener Gura as Evangelist. Surely, the narrative abilities Gura exemplified in his Schubert lieder are a transferrable skill to Bach's Passions. Johannes Weisser has grown into a strong baritone since his breakout performance as Don Giovanni. Bach's expert composition of Jesus's recitatives paints a complicated, almost operatic image of Jesus that is at times noble and potent, but other times human and vulnerable. Weisserproves he is up to the task. Sunhae Im and Bernarda Fink are a joy to listen to, as always. Rising star Topi Lehtipuu is a strong tenor, and I do hope Jacobs, or perhaps another conductor, will utilize Lehtipuu's effortless lyric tenor as an Evangelist--in the St. John Passion perhaps? The boy choir in the first and last numbers of the First Part is simply heavenly.<br /><br />The tempi here are notably moderate. Detractors of Jacobs's Mozart should be pleased at this. Jacobs's Christmas Oratorio, secular Bach cantatas, and motets likewise didn't feature the rapid shifts in tempi or dynamics that many listeners took issue with in his Mozart. For example, the famous opening double choir \\"Kommt, ihr T&ouml;chter\\" clocks in at 8-and-a-half minutes, on par with comparable recordings of the St. Matthew. Jacobs is indeed at home with Bach. Some interesting artistic choices here include the lute obbligato in \\"Ja, freilich--Komm, S&uuml;&szlig;es Kreuz,\\" rather than the usual viola da gamba. This famous aria did, in fact, have a lute obbligato in the earliest version (which included only one continuo section for both ensembles, and no soprano in ripieno for that matter!) The version with viola da gamba is included in the appendix. The soprano aria \\"Aus Liebe\\" is taken at a slightly quicker tempo, but so much the better. Many recordings dangerously border on ponderous here; some are taken so slow that the listener loses a sense of melody. Sunhae Im tackles this deceptively difficult aria with birdlike ease and control. The secco recitatives are supplemented with a lute. There is little evidence historically for such an addition (Likely, Bach's first ensemble had an organ and the second had a harpsichord, as in the recording by the Dunedin Consort on Linn Records.) Interestingly, Jacobs also added a lute continuo in the secco recits in his Christmas Oratorio. Nonetheless, it is musically effective. Further, Jacobs freely moves between using a full chorus and one-voice-per-part (OVPP). Chorales are sung with the full power of the RIAS Kammerchor, while some turbae are judiciously scaled down according to the text. In the liner notes Jacobs lays down his apprehensions of using OVPP for choral numbers, and he does so persuasively (though I still belong to the OVPP camp). Indeed, among musicologists and fans of Baroque church music, it is a topic as divisive and hot-button as American party politics. We may never know whether Bach used a full chorus or OVPP, but in this recording Jacobs finds an appealing, dramatic, and judicious middle-ground between the two opposing musicological camps.<br /><br />In comparison to the competition: it is more dramatic than Herreweghe's, much cleaner than Harnoncourt's, less rigid than Gardiner's. I estimate that this will be the recording that I reference as the standard for Bach's magnum opus for quite a while. Absolutely not to be missed.he is up to the task. Sunhae Im and Bernarda Fink are a joy to listen to, as always. Rising star Topi Lehtipuu is a strong tenor, and I do hope Jacobs, or perhaps another conductor, will utilize Lehtipuu's effortless lyric tenor as an Evangelist--in the St. John Passion perhaps? The boy choir in the first and last numbers of the First Part is simply heavenly.<br /><br />The tempi here are notably moderate. Detractors of Jacobs's Mozart should be pleased at this. Jacobs's Christmas Oratorio, secular Bach cantatas, and motets likewise didn't feature the rapid shifts in tempi or dynamics that many listeners took issue with in his Mozart. For example, the famous opening double choir \\"Kommt, ihr Töchter\\" clocks in at 8-and-a-half minutes, on par with comparable recordings of the St. Matthew. Jacobs is indeed at home with Bach. Some interesting artistic choices here include the lute obbligato in \\"Ja, freilich--Komm, Süßes Kreuz,\\" rather than the usual viola da gamba. This famous aria did, in fact, have a lute obbligato in the earliest version (which included only one continuo section for both ensembles, and no soprano in ripieno for that matter!) The version with viola da gamba is included in the appendix. The soprano aria \\"Aus Liebe\\" is taken at a slightly quicker tempo, but so much the better. Many recordings dangerously border on ponderous here; some are taken so slow that the listener loses a sense of melody. Sunhae Im tackles this deceptively difficult aria with birdlike ease and control. The secco recitatives are supplemented with a lute. There is little evidence historically for such an addition (Likely, Bach's first ensemble had an organ and the second had a harpsichord, as in the recording by the Dunedin Consort on Linn Records.) Interestingly, Jacobs also added a lute continuo in the secco recits in his Christmas Oratorio. Nonetheless, it is musically effective. Further, Jacobs freely moves between using a full chorus and one-voice-per-part (OVPP). Chorales are sung with the full power of the RIAS Kammerchor, while some turbae are judiciously scaled down according to the text. In the liner notes Jacobs lays down his apprehensions of using OVPP for choral numbers, and he does so persuasively (though I still belong to the OVPP camp). Indeed, among musicologists and fans of Baroque church music, it is a topic as divisive and hot-button as American party politics. We may never know whether Bach used a full chorus or OVPP, but in this recording Jacobs finds an appealing, dramatic, and judicious middle-ground between the two opposing musicological camps.<br /><br />In comparison to the competition: it is more dramatic than Herreweghe's, much cleaner than Harnoncourt's, less rigid than Gardiner's. I estimate that this will be the recording that I reference as the standard for Bach's magnum opus for quite a while. Absolutely not to be missed.
1476727651|1.0|Seemed like King wasn't trying to scare, but rather to DISGUST. That's a cheat - it's bad horror, not clever scary horror.  Also seemed like he was trying to pull out all ths stops - everything he's learned in last 30 years of writing - and just dumping it on if he thought it might get to you and get a rise out of you (usually to disgust you  since that's probably easier than making someone scared)- whatever it took even if it didnt' hang together.  Also tired of eveyrone talking in the same voice; what I mean is that I don't mind dialogue with s*** every other word - but does everyone speak like that?  Seems too unrealistic. It was worse in Under the Dome - but here too, too many characters spoke in the same crude way (thank heavens Abra did not at least). It's lazy too- like one could say ok, the True Knot is the extreme on the  bad side of what the good Shining is - but it's not developed that way. Instead True not just seems like an arbritrary (disguisting, not scary) villian that could have been plopped in any sequel, rather than made a better fit to the shining ability (and book of the same title). Maybe he had that in mind when he first started, but couldn't bother witht the effort it would take to develop that properly. Why bother when we all rush out and buy it even if its garbage?  I could also see this work being crafted. This is never a good sign when reading a book. For example, I was acutely aware that he writes simple easy to understand sentances. How come I've never  noticed that before? The book also seemed patched together- the author note at the end he wrote  (which I liked alot by the way) sheds some light on this-outside researchers thelped him know even the details of his own earlier book, so I guess  he had to weave stuff together from a variety of others.  maybe I've just outgrown him. Shining was my first King book. Ironically, I read it because of the movie King hated  but that I found very scary - he should thank Kubrik though because it lead me to read every King book for many years and I'll bet it did for many others as well.  There were a couple of good things in Doctor Sleep- there was a great line about Catholoic education =- something about how if you get them young, they are yours for life, no matter who they become. But that was a wonderful commentary overshadowed by other stuff, almost all of which seemed thoughtless. I agree with another poster that first half more engaging than second half. If it was anyone but King, I actually would have stopped about page 150 but I stuck it out to the end. Boring.  I won't say not to read it because if you're like me and read the Shining, you just feel compelled to know what may have happened to Danny. It's like not being able to not look at a car wreck. There are so many reviews, no one will read this, although I expect its one star rating will get a bunch of \\"unhelpful\\" ratings, as all one star ratings get from people who don't even read them. I wonder if King changed his writing style after his accident, or perhaps he's just exhausted what he can offer this genre or maybe there's not motivation to write somethign really good.  for me, it did do one good thing: it provided closure. With this sequel to the first king book I read, it will be the last king book I read. Fitting end to the King era. No matter. I'm sure he's, as the saying goes, laughing all the way to the bank.

0345529057|5.0|Not much sense in describing it.  Those who love sci-fi or fantasy are making these books best sellers.  Read on.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I guess I give about 4 stars. Takes a minute to figure out what is next some times. Just a different layout than what I usually play.
0553801473|5.0|All sci-fi and fantasy fans will want to read this.  It's a monumental work that's keep you glued to the book until it's done.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I love this film  Cute, funny, action packed with a moral through out.  The casting spot on.  Jack Back as a panda, Angelina Jolie a sleek and powerful tigress Dustin Hoffman as the Master, Ian McShane as TaiLung  PERFECT  This one for all ages
1444737112|5.0|What a wonderful read!  This is not a story just for cat lovers but one for any of us who, at times, need to understand the plight of others and their struggles for recovery.  It reveals the reliance that people and animals have on each other.  To see how James worked on changing his life around and his honesty in sharing that with the reader brings us into his life, and, of course, Bob touches us from the moment we meet him.  So happy that they found one another and that their story moves us to so many emotions!  Best book I have read in ages!
B000W7FDBM|5.0|I'll admit I was late to join the Harry Potter parade.  I am sorry I waited.  It is enjoyable and is true to the book.  The cast a perfect fit, almost as if Ms. Rowlings had the actors in mind when writing the book.  Enjoy the magic

1476727651|3.0|Maybe I expected too much from this book because I found it disappointing on some levels.  I've been a Stephen King fan since the beginning; I remember how excited I was when I 'discovered' him and Carrie.  I've read every one of his books since then, and been more or less happy with most of them.  This one, however, leaves me feeling a bit disappointed.  Maybe I'm subconsciously comparing it to The Shining, which is my all-time favorite King book -- and there's little likelihood it could possibly live up to that experience.  Whatever the reason, all I know is that I found myself thinking \\"hurry up and get on with it\\" while reading Doctor Sleep.  While the premise is interesting, it just doesn't take off for me.  It tends to ramble a bit in parts, Danny's alcoholism, while it would obviously be a life-altering situation, is mentioned to the point of being redundant, and the True Knot is never truly explained.  Even Abra doesn't totally work.  Danny is a better drawn character, and you can tell that King genuinely cares for him, but other than having the same name, and a few mentions of his childhood at the Overlook Hotel, he could be a whole new character because The Shining is so far removed from Doctor Sleep.  It isn't a BAD book by any means; there are many absorbing moments in the book.  But, in my humble opinion, it isn't a GREAT book either.  It isn't even in King's Top Five.  All I can suggest to readers is don't expect it to even come close to living up to The Shining.  On second thought, try to not even THINK of The Shining when you sit down to read this one.
1476733953|5.0|Great book, will definitely read the whole series......couldn't find in local bookstores yet.......so glad I found and ordered on Amazon.....looking forward to getting next book

B000TGJ8AS|1.0|I order only closed captioned NCIS series...I read your description and the first thing you mentioned was that it was closed captioned...my husband is deaf and really needs the words to follow the action...we love this series, and not all of them are as advertised...which can be very disappointing when you are geared up to have a nice evening of watching NCIS...season three was closed captioned, and we were hoping to go to the next season to follow the story....we are very disappointed....can you check and see if there are any closed captioned season 4 dvds?  we will return your other one if you have one...look forward to your reply, thank you...
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|It's really hard to continue a story so many years after the main event. I think Fielding did a decent job in her sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary, which I *loved*, but this attempt is a difficult read. Basically, we don't want Bridget to be totally immature after so many years...but readers want something similarly fun (& a love story). A hard trick. Instead, I really enjoyed [[ASIN:0989427218 From Finland with Love: A Novel]], which had a lovable, bumbling heroine in search of love and felt like a cross between Nick Hornby and Bright Lights, Big City. I really did laugh out loud with that; sorry to say that I can't say the same for Mad About the Boy.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|Fast service, this is a very good product. Thank you for the service you provided. The music is great and quality sound
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|was just as good the as the times I saw them  during the season.  blu-ray makes it even better. Would definately buy the next season.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|The very FIRST experiment was a bust. I couldn't believe it. Not a thing happened and I was totally focused and positive that it would. I was ready and confident something would show up in the 48 hour time frame. However, one of the 2 days ended up not being so good at all. Not one good thing came out of that entire 48 hours and I am so surprised because I was genuinely open to receiving.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed when nothing happened and actually lost more faith in the \\"FP\\" than I had when I started reading the book - and that is a big let down. Not even sure I want to keep reading the book and/or try any more of what seem to be ridiculous experiments.<br /><br />Author said write it off if nothing happens on the first one....really...well how are you supposed to believe to go on reading the rest of the experiments and think anything else will happen with any of the others if the first, simple one didn't prove a thing. At least that is my take away from it.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie is tasteless, and boring. If you have seen the amazing film Moon you'll instantly recognize that this movie stole the biggest plot twist in the movie DIRECTLY from Moon. They didn't even hide it, at all. Then for some good measure sprinkled Independence Day in. The acting is terrible, the effects are just polishing a poorly written turd. Just do yourself a favor and watch Moon first if you somehow read this before watching this horribly unoriginal garbage.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect with this movie.  If Morgan Freeman is in it, it has got to be good, right?  Damn right is was.  The special effects in the movie are the best I have ever seen, they are mind blowing.  And if you want a surprise, well, this has the surprise of all surprises. BAM!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There is literally nothing else to say other than wow. John Green is amazing and this book sucks you in and keeps you enthralled throughout the whole thing...a happy observer of this beautiful and tragic story.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|It's decent how it amplifies the colors and how it turns them into a pdf right away. Good app, thank you!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|We all hear how many problems thiis movie has before it premier, but I really diidn´t care, because this movie hold me to my seat for the length of the movie. We can see Pitt no like a heroe but both father and husband and is for this reason, the love for his family He accept this mission.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|It's just perfect. The sound, the cover, CD, everything. Demos that are on the CD are also a valuable insight.
B00632HWOG|2.0|The application allows me to review email subjects and folders content. However I was not able to use if to read actual content. I needed to configure my own
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Entertaining from start to finish. Would not recommend to anyone under 14, due to startling images and several intense scenes. That said, I loved it and saw it several times in the theater. I enjoyed watching my friends squirm and jump at scenes I new were coming up. Hoping there will be a sequel !
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Quick and sample installation/setup. It immediately recongnize my wireless printer. I was able to print asap a picture from my gallery. The only inconvenient I had was when I wanted to print a document. A popup came stating that HP needed to convert the file in the cloud to printed and I was asked to register my self. I did not like that my documented needed to go to the cloud neither to register myself...something which I still don't do. I still have an HP Touchpad Tablet with WEBOS and has already the capability to print to a wireless HP printer with no need to use any cloud or register my self to any printer service from HP. Why is so different for Android?

B008LD09LS|4.0|My son received this as a gift for his 10th birthday.  He was so thrilled.  There wasn't any assembly required, other than charging the battery and then placing it in the drone itself.  It can be flown using a miriad of devices including a smart phone, a kindle or any other type of tablet.  I would recommend navigating with a tablet as the controls on the phone are quite small and can't see the picture as well as it is so small.  It was easy to get it airborne, and it hovers quite well, but flying it is a different matter and doesn't react as well as we thought it would and have had some collisions with the house and trees as it wasn't responding according to our input.  I am hoping this is just because we are new to using it and have to get used to it more, but so far can't make it stop and turnaround on a dime, or fly and land precisely where we want it.  Maybe just some more practice it what it needed.  Time will tell.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Arrived on time! Love the movie! Also a plus that the ultra violet version comes with it. That way if I am on the go the kids can watch their favorite movie!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I knew someone would eventually come out with something like this. It's so nice to be able to just plug it in to the TV and stream shows. Hate to have to have a big Xbox or whatever to stream from. This eliminates the need for that. :)
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I rarely get to watch Supernatural and found purchasing the entire season was easy and a great idea. It's such a awesome show with great characters and story line.

0345545338|5.0|JOHN GRISHAM never disappoints me. He always writes a good fast read without profanity and sex.  He never clutters the story with unnecessary smut.
B002U3CCKQ|2.0|I really enjoyed Sharp objects, that's why I bought this book, but here all the characters are overly pessimistic, and the book's plot is not that good.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Despite little similarity in our upbringing or life circumstances,  I related to these characters as though we had been tethered together all our lives. McKenna weaves a thick blanket of a story, and covers us in its musty misery. She is a skilled story teller, allowing just enough fresh air to sustain the reader.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|qreat fun and I really enjoyed the story line and the graphics were incredible throughout the whole Game wonderful and will recommend
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love the game can't get enough of it! Very happy with it and is highly recommended to everyone to get this game.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Lightning Bolt is one of those albums that you can't listen to just one song. This album was definitely worth the wait.
0345529057|5.0|Some of my favorite books, I was blown away by the narrative and sucked in instantly. I would recommend this book to anybody that is a fan of fantasy or drama, or just diplomacy in general.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|It is a gift or our son and he is loving it. The back stories, the copies allow him to play it on any of his gadgets.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its fun and good game. I enjoyed the game. I had fun playing the game. Its a good game to play. You should install it. Its fun

B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|I waited years for this book to come out and am heartbroken. I downloaded this audio book yesterday morning and by the evening I was in tears, mourning with Bridget. I love Bridget's character and never would of in a million years wished single parenting on her. While I realize that there are no such things as \\"happily ever after,\\" I was disappointed that the newest book skipped the last 20 years of her life. I would rather have read about those years than her cougar years. Fielding could have done a better job with this book. What's with all the Twitter too?
158270208X|3.0|I am grateful for receiving this journal but cannot seem to muster gratitude for receiving the &#34;Thank you&#34; edition that does not have all the gold embossing.  I now see a photo of this edition when I pull up the Gratitude product on Amazon. The edition with all of the gold embossing intact appears to have the words &#34;gratitude&#34; imprinted on the cover.  I would have been delighted to have been given a choice of editions instead of having the choice made for me.  This now explains the several customer reviews that mention the missing gold lettering/embossing.  I think the partial gold embossing is meant to look worn but it just doesn't pass muster.  Otherwise, I would have given this product five stars.
B00FKQ38OE|5.0|No Lie, this is the Paul McCartney album we've been waiting for. From the 1st minute of \\"Save Us\\" I knew, I just knew that the sound I had been waiting for was here. I'm not a big Jeff Lynne fan and he ,in my opinion,  messed up \\"Flaming Pie\\". Paul's voice has sounded kinda of muddled in the last few albums but this one is spot on. He had Giles Martin working with him, Giles did an awesome job on the \\"Beatles Love Project\\" and he's got Sir Paul in the right place here. Even if you have never owned a McCartney album but you like good music this one is  for you.

B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I've liked much of Gladwell's writing and this one is up to his usual standards. He makes two very clear points compellingly. Being a strengths-based and solution-oriented therapist, I found some nice arguments for my hopeful approach to people in this book. It's a quick read.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|In our opinion, this is the funniest, best written comedy on television, and we can watch the episodes over and over and still laugh as hard, as well as pick up on things we missed the first time around.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|I have had hidden ideas holding me back from being as successful as I would've liked. Through the techniques and subjects taught in this book, I've been able to identify them, release them and move forward. Now I don't feel conflicted when I think about my business.
B0053O89U6|5.0|Best comedy on TV, and we thoroughly enjoy watching reruns of the episodes and still laugh just as hard as the first time.  It has stayed fresh and hilariously funny through all the seasons.
B00ARAO720|5.0|Good action, great story...very much worth watching. Kind of knock off of a couple other similar stories, but it kept up with them and held its own.
B0058RN85O|5.0|Hands down, best comedy on TV, in our opinion.  It deserves the Emmys and other awards it has been winning every year!
B000HZGCEG|5.0|Timeline has fun with the go back in time and change the future by not even addressing how things changed when one never returned but lived happily ever after. A little too much hysterics, almost to the point of distraction. But Lady Claire's and Merrick's fast developing relationship with their occasional humorous exchanges made up for it. Fun to watch.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Metallica was a fun band when I was a kid. They're the kind of band you outgrow when your balls drop and you discover good music. I remember how they were so anti corporate, but then when Cliff Burton died they put out a video, got a taste of wealth, and haven't stopped selling out since. I don't begrudge anyone selling out, I mean I would. But these dudes make Paris Hilton pause and say, \\"Wow, you guys are spoiled and out of touch with reality.\\" If Cliff Burton hadn't passed, he would still have left the band during Injustice For All... at the latest. These dudes should be ashamed of this film. They all come across as spoiled little children. The only monster in Some Kind of Monster are four undeservedly monstrous egos. Playing scales really, really fast doesn't make you a genius, just technically proficient.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Why would such a not a TC fan get so wrapped up with his movies?? Great writers, great stories. He just keeps doing it right. This was simply a fun show to watch. A nice blend of humor and seriousness, mixed with outrageous action.
0802473156|4.0|I love this book and I ordered another copy for my cousin who is going through Chemotherapy to keep her busy throughtout her treatment. My only problem was the table of contents and a few pages after that had black ink smeared down the left side of the page. It looks super embarrassing and cheap so I never gave it to her as gift and had to go buy it from Target instead. But overall the actual book is amazing and I recommend to anyone who is married.
0891419063|5.0|Intense. Heartbreaking. Horrifying. Mind-boggling.<br /><br />This book was quite a read.<br /><br />Sledge's descriptions of his experiences on Peleliu and Okinawa are incredibly honest and straightforward--there's no sugarcoating or glorifying war. He puts emphasis on how miserable, ghastly and appalling the fighting and living conditions were, and how wasteful and tragic the immense loss of young lives was. His book is a striking demonstration of how \\"war is hell.\\"<br /><br />Despite all the atrocious things he wrote about, he did have some warm, humorous and inspiring stories to share that were a good reminder that he and the other marines were all just young guys, and many of them were quite admirable and heroic.<br /><br />I'm glad he was willing to share his (and the other marines') story so that what happened, what they accomplished and what they sacrificed will never be forgotten.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far I like game.  Not too hard but still interesting enough to hold my attention.  It lets me cover more than a couple levels before I get disgusted cause I can't go any further.
039916409X|5.0|After starting the book I remembered watching her Tapping for $50,000 video.  I decided that there was nothing to lose, so tap, tap, tap.<br />The next day, I started to research a re-fi for my home.  On the phone the agent quoted my house value for about $60K more than my estimate.  This certainly made me smile. Then, a week later and three more days of tapping, the actual appraisal went up another $68K.  Reading all about the process and rationale behind tapping and attraction is terrific, but it is when you just say the words and do the tapping...that's when you get to have the real fun!  --Mary from Say and Do

B0082A3HTQ|4.0|Is a very good sound track. is not as others which has a lot of instrumentals or a lot of poor quality pop or very knew pop songs. The instrumental score of this movie is very good, you can use it long with very knew good intrumental themes in low sound ambient, and the pop side except EWF, that is very famous, very good but also very spread, is very good also, fresh music for listen or for be used in parties or as low sound. in fact, a very good record.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It is typical romantic story.<br />Makes you laugh at some parts.<br />Very light and nice to read.<br />It's okay to read to pass time.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Cute app that is so addictive. The only challenge I have come across so far is that after playing an extended amount of time it will throw me totally out of the game and take me to my main screen. The game itself is tons of fun for folks of all ages. Highly recommend.

An adult Kent talks to a Priest for advice on how to handle his secret identity.  It is hard not to roll your eyes.  These pretensions are put in place to validate the Superman character in our contemporary culture, which is flooded with various takes on superheros and action characters.  This is like the post-post modern Superman, trying to retrofit many aspects Dr. Manhattan into the original mythos.  The problem is, Dr. Manhattan himself is pretty dated at this point.  We've evolved past the singular all powerful superhero, and moved onto to comic book characters with more complex inner lives.  All that said, director Zack Snyder delivers solid action sequences throughout this movie, a decently developed subplot driven by Lois Lane, and solid antagonists for Superman in his fellow Kryptonians.

B009DT424Y|1.0|Got this to use with a Bose wireless mini speaker. Got it to pair once after much trying . But couldn't do it again. Also the echo was terrible and prevented singing with music from another speaker. Returned it effortless to amazon at no cost and got full refund quickly. Still looking for a wireless mic to pair with my Bose Minii
B00A77II0U|4.0|The plot is a little muddled and a little unlikely but this is absorbing and entertaining.  The puzzles were good. Some a little challenging.  The HO parts were really well done.  It could do with a little less gratuitous prompting. If users want hints they can get them.  You have to be willing to go along with the way the game goes and not get picky.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|The soundtrack is faithful to the movie, so you can continue to follow the plot by just listening to the songs.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|A nice plot with no conflict.  Some clever puzzles.  Very good looking. Long enough to be interesting.  Might be a little too sweet for some.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie and the 3D visuals are simply stunning.  My only word of caution is to make sure you have a 3D capable Blu Ray and TV, but if you have that it is great.  I will never watch a movie like this in 2D again.
B0056UHSYK|3.0|Oh David. I had such faith! Alas, this is pop-rock wannabe. His last album was so good, but this one (alas!) is not so much. His vocals are as strong as ever, but the songs sound like they came from the same generic blender.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie and the 3D visuals are simply stunning.  My only word of caution is to make sure you have a 3D capable Blu Ray and TV, but if you have that it is great.  I will never watch a movie like this in 2D again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|very good product, good quality and appearance, easy to install and configure, good price and good alternative to more expensive products
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Haven't been able to see the movies, yet. Seems my Blu-ray player is not connecting with my computer, not allowing the movie to run. Well, it will happen one day soon and I will have my first Blu-ray experience.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story was written in a moving style and the author did a great job with the story line.  I hope you enjoy this as I did.  I hope that there will be a sequel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am captured by this series.  Looking forward to the next chapter.  I will find it and start it immediately.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Another very good CD...I would recommend this to anyone.<br />Unlike Paradise this one can be listened to by any age group.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has taken a plot that essentially boils down to a cat and mouse game between telepathic vampires and a recovering alcoholic attempting to protect a child with telekinetic and precognitive abilities, and he makes it absolutely believable.  It is King's continued ability to make the surreal real that keeps his readers coming back for more.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Excellent!  Love it ! Love it ! Love it! She is a very unique artist and am pleased with CD!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I love going to the tournament jumping the horíse. so close to real life it'll blow your mind
B002I9Z89Y|4.0|If you are a Star Trek original series fan, there is no better way to enjoy it than on Blu-ray.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very touching and it made me cry which doesn't happen often while reading a book I recommend this book!!!!!!!!
B001TH16DS|4.0|If you are a fan of the original Star Trek, Blu-ray is the best way to enjoy it.  It gets a thumbs up from me.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've been using this app for months on my kindle and all of a sudden it just won't work please fix it
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I knew it would leave me hanging like that AIA book. Now I am like Hazel, wanting to know what happened next. If she died too like Anna in AIA. I hate you, John Green for ending it like that. &#62;:( Whatever.<br /><br />And as much as I really wanna hate John Green, I don't. Not really. Like the AIA book (this book is just a fictional book and doesn't really exist, it was just mentioned in TFOS book), I know that it just feel right to end like that. It's appropriate. Although it just leave me wanting to know what happened with the other character... I'm okay with the ending.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars got really high praises from almost everyone I know from Goodreads. My real life friends (those who had already read the book) says that I would love the book and will cry like they did. Well, yeah I was expecting it to be so epic. WHAT? Put yourself in my shoes and of course you'll expect something high from it.<br /><br />Did my expectation meets the book's praises from everyone? Well, yeah! But not that much. I mean, first part of the book, I'm waiting for the crying part. And got nothing. But that's okay. I told myself, it's just the first part, of course there's no crying yet. Middle part, still got nothing. Although I'm quite satisfied with how the story is developing.<br /><br />I love Augustus, love Hazel, I like them together. I like how they try to be with each other even with all the sickness they both got. So yeah... Slightly last part (maybe between the middle and last part of the book), I got a bit shocked. Because well he relapsed. I guess that it is a possibility even though they cleared you at first and still clear for a long time.<br /><br />Also, I don't like how Gus told his friend (forgot his name) and Hazel to make an Obituary for him. It just breaks my heart. Still does whenever I think of it, like right now. I'm a bit teary eyed remembering how and what they wrote for him in case he dies. I would never be strong enough to write about myloved ones for their funeral. I would never be strong enough to tell them to write one, in the first place.<br /><br />But that last part? I freakin' cried. WHY?! Why... It's just so sudden. I turn the next page, on the next chapter... HE DIED?! WHY?! JUST. LIKE. THAT. I was like. WHAT?! :((( and then I love the letter he made for the author of AIA. It was really for Hazel. How he felt for her. It's just so... heartbreaking. Because he's gone and all that. And I feel what Hazel was feeling while reading the letter.<br /><br />I feel like there's more to the letter when it got cut off. Yeah. It ends with the letter. But I really feel that there's still some message left. I do think it was cut because Hazel dies too. Yeah. Sad. :(<br /><br />I don't really like reading books where one of the main characters die. That's why I never read Nicholas Sparks books anymore. But anyway... The plot of this TFOS is really good. The characters are well created, well-thought.<br /><br />It shows what happens to people who have cancer. How they feel. I know it might not be what they REALLY think because they might lose hope... but this book is about learning to live while you can. Hoping that one day you'll be okay. That SOMEONE is still there to love you unconditionally. Who support you without question asks because they love you so much. It's not just about the person who got cancer. It's also about the people around them. Their loved ones trying to cope, it might always be rough... but again... Don't lose hope. I know it is hard. SO hard and SO EASY to just give it all up. But if you could still can... DON'T.<br /><br />I might be interpreting the book wrong... but that's how I felt after reading it. So that's just my opinion and you are entitled to yours too. :)
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It reminds me of Super Mario Bros, it is a very fun game. Keeps us busy from time to time
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Really worth the money great time passing, addictive game. Wonderful for any age. I love it ! Buy this game !! It's kind of like Candy Crush
B00B671W6W|5.0|I've received my Anthrax Anthems CD on time in good condition and good quality sound. I'm also happy with the price thanks.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|this game is a fun game but it is plainly missIng so much which is a shame but this game can still be enjoyable and fun
B000001EUR|5.0|I want to thank you for sending Scorpions Love at First Sting on time and in good condition. Good job keep up the good work.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|Don't waste your money. Thin characters, thin plot line. Where did they get, \\"Historical Thriller\\"? Many facts were not well researched. The story is set in 1940. However, the author makes too many references to items not invented or developed until the 1950's or later. Not much history here. More like a bad dream.
0765325950|3.0|The book gave good finish to the series. Some of the threads very truly great (I especially loved everything involving Pevara and the black tower.) There were some nice surprises (Demandred finally got into action.) Unfortunately, the book was to short.  Several threads that had long been prepared, e.g. Alivia helping Rand to die, were resolved way to quickly, thus shortening the enjoyment of the volume substantially. I liked reading it, but I wished it had been two volumes just so everything could have been dealt with in more detail.
1476727651|5.0|If you liked the shining you will like this.  This is a sequel to the shinning and retains some of the same characters.  As usual King has a way with words and keeps you wanting to continue reading.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really enjoyed this one, although I didn't get completely sucked in like I did with City of Bones - the intriguing love story of the first is pretty much not present, although there are still some love-triangle elements, it's a little weird now with the sibling angle.  Keep hoping it will come out that they are not blood related as I really want Clary and Jace to get together!  Lots of action though, and it moves the Valentine plotline along well.  Definitely going to keep on reading the series.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The writers have very interesting stories. Enjoy how all of the characters mesh and joke around with each other.<br />Love all of the facial expressions, too.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|While a little more disjointed than its predecessor, the film is staying mostly true to form and is representing the original vision of the late Gene Roddenberry quite well.  It is to be hoped that futur plots can be shored up in what promises to be a very rewarding franchise.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Makes me want to go read the shining all over again!  Really great read had a hard time putting it down.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Amazing game love how you can compete in the collision ?  Found some awesome codes DV117 and 2years that will give you 35 gems I think. It either 35 or 25 30.Have fun
B00865P3AS|5.0|These guys are great and really get the room pumping.  If you like pop music and/or cello this is a must!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down, and that's such a rare feeling for me to have. I can't wait to start the next one.
0785168109|5.0|Packaging is awesome it totally keep the book perfectly.The book really nice, it is a teasure for all of the Iron man fans!
B00A85EMVK|3.0|I love the movie Top Gun and was excited to see it in 3D. I figured that with all the aerial flying scenes the 3D would look pretty cool, however I was very disappointed in the 3D although the Blu-ray was fine.  The 3d was less than spectacular, maybe because the movie is several years old..  I would not recommend buying this for the 3D.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very fun game for the whole family. It is easy to learn and play. You gain coins the farther you make in the game then you can unlock additional features like New vehicles and courses.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was hoping I could put my computer screen onto my TV, but you can't really do that.  It only works with a handful of apps.  If you have a smart TV then there is not much use for Chromecast.  If you have a dumb TV then it probably has value.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Good to see at home when no cable is available<br /><br />Great story bad screenplay, direction is mediocre and special effects from the 80's.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|If there is anyone who does not need a plan B, it has to be Van Morrison. I have most of Van's recordings and they have never disappointed me. Born to Sing replaces a CD which was damaged & the fact that I chose to purchase it again, speaks volumes!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Beautiful story that elicited a range of emotions from happiness to sadness, even anger (at the character who showed a total disregard for any human in the way of his life's dream - to capture the bird).  Definitely will buy and suggest to all I know to watch it.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|This book is absolutely terrible.  Briget is boring and the theme is dull.  How many times do we have to hear about nits and crabs?  Do we really need all that dialogue from the children and why oh why would she kill off Mark Darcy?  There was no need to write this book since it has nothing interesting to contribute.  The thing to dowould have been to expound on her marriage and the beauty of leaving behind the singletons.  Don't bother buying this book.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I am an amateur Photographer and needed something simple to remotely operate the shutter on my Nikon D3100.<br />I found a few products but decided to stay with Nikon for the camera.<br />Remote works great. On the D3100 the receptacle is not as described in the literature near the bottom of the connector bank. It near the top. It is not a problem since the plug only fits in to one of the connectors.<br />The slide switch to keep the shutter open for longer than 30 second exposures in &#34;Bulb&#34; shutter setting works flawless.<br />I'd highly recommend this switch to someone who does not wish to shell out extra money on a wireless system.<br />Sadly the cable is only about 3 feet long and cannot be extended.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was looking for a book during down time while on vacation -- like while on the plane. Added features were that it's a book whose movie is coming out and heck, I read Hunger Games. Main complaint, as with Girl with Dragon Tattoo, is that the first book in trilogy is a complete story while then the second book is cliffhanger and therefore  n incomplete story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I put off reading these books because I didn't want to be thrown in to yet another whirlwind of heartache, fear, anger, triumph, love, and complete terror that came with reading 'Harry Potter'. I was so involved with those characters and I didn't want to lose another set of 'friends' like I did when the series was over...but, dang it, they pulled me in.<br /><br />I loved this book. I wouldn't want my little cousins reading it until they're at least 15, but I doubt I can stop them.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I'm still wondering why it took me so long to watch this show! I'm watching episode 8 right now and I'm really obsessed with it. AHS is one of those shows that you get addicted with since the very first episode. The way the stories are told is so unique, and when you think you know something, everything changes with crazy twists (something I love about TV shows that always leave you clueless about what's going to happen next), and the acting is great too, the whole cast is terrific! My favorite character is Violet. The special effects, the scary scenes and the drama make this show one of the best horror shows of the last few years; it has a little bit of something, it's just not horror and blood, you get to see a psychological side of the characters before the craziness shows up.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for an awesome show, you have to watch this! You won't regret it. Can't wait to catch up with seasons 2 & 3.
B002WJI66C|4.0|The Boo we received is only about 3.5&#34; tall which is perfect for my Son's other plush Mario but note the discrepancy on the size for what we received.  No problem for us as my Son loves it in any size!
B00DW1WR14|5.0|While I agree that Pearl Jam have changed their style on the past two albums, I like it. There are times I do miss the longer 5 minute tracks,  but everybody needs a change. That being said this album is really good. Sirens grew on me a lot and I now love that song. From start to begining this album is really catchy. Is it their best? You know the answer to this question. But it's a really creative album and the packaging is solid. Pearl Jam always have great artwork.
1846573785|5.0|Never listened to an audio book and I really enjoyed this. I look forward to receiving Darker and Freed in the mail
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Fast moving and interesting concept on how to take advantage of the witness protection program. Clever story.
B004K4IZ54|3.0|Every list of \\"Best 3D films\\" has this one in one of the top spots so I assumed this would be the definitive 3D movie for my home viewing experience. This did not live up to my expectations. I had seen the movie before on a regular 2D bluray and was \\"wowed\\" by the visuals, thinking the whole time - the 3D version of this must be amazing. The effect is actually very subtle and it feels like they have many missed opportunities in scenes that could have had way more depth. Overall neither the movie or the visuals are bad, my 3 stars are for the employment of 3D in this movie.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Pacific Rim was never designed to be anything more then a fun popcorn flick with awesome fights between giant robots and giant monsters. It delivers on that most defiantly but it also manages to have some great character moments to. Charlie Day, Ron Perlman and Idris Elba all stand out in their roles, while the main 2 characters more or less fall into place. That doesn't distract from the movie because this isn't supposed to be oscar winning acting. The movie is everything I could ever hope it would be. Is it my favorite movie ever? No. But its still a fun thrill ride worth getting back in line for again and again. And on a plus note the 3D is very good for a converted 3D film. Prolly the best 3D film of the summer. I feel this movie will be more appreciated in years to come but for now use your own judgement and just let the fun wash over you.
B004S5C43E|4.0|Archer is of course a great story teller, and his use of historical facts to weave the story of Mallory on Everest was really good. found it hard to put it down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Started off like I had it figured out.... until about a third of the way through.  The no idea at all.  But it all ties together very nicely.  Good story like the rest of his.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery Manor seems like a good hidden item game. I have  been playing for two days and seems I have barely scratched the surface. I do believe that it will take a long time to get to the end  if there is one...
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Twice it has stolen all my accumulated rre fish and treasure chests.  Don't even try to find customer service.  It does not exist.
B00BMNM4H6|1.0|it wont download on my kindle fire and I have no idea why. and this is very frusterating and I need help.
B000RIWB16|5.0|if you are not aware the vinyl mix is different than the cd mix. so it's worth picking up both if your into vinyl.<br />the only problem i had was the copy i recieved was maybe a VG cover. a little dinged up but i bought it used without any kind of description so that was what i get looking for a bargain i guess. anyway like i said the album is great.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|Ghostbusters (Mastered in 4K) (Single-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra Violet Digital... one of my favorite classics of all time now in the best format that is available at this time what a gift this would make this holiday season?:)
B0040X46TE|5.0|Soothing music.  Have played again and again.  Amazed at Iz's voice and talent.  Also bought Facing Future and just as good.
B008F2AKUA|5.0|Greatest Hits: Huey Lewis And The News - This is the best collection of songs by Huey Lewis and The News there has yet to be released its a good item for any fan.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|great movie, great cast, has funny bits thru out. Cant wait until part II comes. I also hope that Downing comes back for Iron Man. No one else can play his part.
B00ENIR864|5.0|I just got this app, and I am loving it.  Everyone should have QR scanner on their device.  It is one of the most useful things that you can have.  My first scan was in magazine, that took me to link of a performance at the Kennedy Center, and that link, linked to other clips.  What can be done with QR codes, is amazing.  And this app is free, you can't beat that price.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is a fun game. I like to play while I'm waiting at appointments and its a great time waster.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a beautifully, well written book. I was completely enthralled and couldn't wait to turn the page to see what happened next. I give it 5 stars.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This book helped me to understand what it means to live in a Muslim world as a woman. It also helped me to understand how the difficulties have made the women stronger than women in other parts of the world. It reminds me to pray for them everyday, that they may come to know the loving God who love them so tenderly.<br />The evil will never win the battle.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Shipped early, performs as advertised, easy set up/install.  Needs more content providers - that's the only drawback.  I really like it and would recommend it.  I think they will expand the content providers along the way.
1476727651|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but Stephen King has not disappointed me yet and I have read almost all his books.
B00BT70J0Y|5.0|This is fantastic! Reiner was one of the great conductors of the 20th Century, and here is his Chicago RCA legacy. This is like some of the Columbia or RCA \\"Original Jackets\\" collections of the past, but on steroids. That is its strength as well as its weakness. Yes, you get all the original album art, notes, etc. Major plus. The downside is that this set could have fit on far fewer CDs. For example, I have the Beethoven 5 & 7, Corolian & Fidelio overtures on a previous release all on one CD. Here they are scattered about on three. Same goes for the Strauss tone poems. So, if you are a Reiner fanatic and have many of the previous Living Stereo or DSD releases, you will notice this scattering. That being said, who cares? The old Dvorak Symphony 9 had a bunch of CD \\"fillers.\\" Now those are back in their original context. So, a few nitpicks, but everything is in order here, a fantastic legacy set. All of the Living Stereo recordings recently released on DSD are here in Red Book CD mix, and they DO sound better than much of the rest. But, hey, it all sounds great for its age, and many of these recordings have NEVER been surpassed - like the Strauss, Bartok, and many of the \\"Pops\\" CDs like Vienna, Iberia and Spain. The physical box presentation is very much like the recent RCA Toscanini set - sturdy box, nice book, but about 3-4 inches shorter than that set in size.
B00F8LPH90|3.0|Was a good and awesome game until it crashed my kindle . Fun game. So please please fix bugs. So I can play this again.
B009K916ZK|1.0|did not work on MacBook air,  and did not work on my Lenovo.  looked rigid,  but simple never worked and I am now outside USA so not worth sending it back
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I prefer this app. It gives you hour by hour weather and you can add zip codes to check other locations.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I really like the app. The Nexus 7 FHD 2013 screen is wonderful.  And the app is beautiful. I ran into a big but about liking it today. I was looking for information about grouping books in collections. I could do this on my 3rd Generation Kindle device and I can do this on my desktop, and I now have found that I could do this if I had an iDevice, but I cannot create collections or otherwise group my books on Android.  This makes no sense.  I knocked off one star for this. I might have marked off more just for having the feature in the iOS App but not the Android, but it is a pretty good app otherwise.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Not sure about the naysayers.  This is a great album and I have been listening to NIN since their first release. Love the progression.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|It's been a while, since we've had a truly angry Elvis album.  This one's a gem.  The writing is perfect.  The Roots add great musicianship and really help Elvis to once again show his versatility.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My 9yo read it in about a week. She couldn't put it down. She is a huge Percy Jackson Fan.
B0061S073A|3.0|It does it's job in keeping your child from making purchases online, but when your child hits an ad, it closes the app they were using and brings them back to the program page. I wish it would just cancel the ad link and go right back into the program. It's especially annoying when my child is looking at interactive storybooks and the ads are right there on the page next to the things she is suppose to touch. I am constantly having to stop what I'm doing so I can restart the book and put her back where she was. There are also plenty of glitches, but based on the lack of safety apps for kids, this is the best program that I've found
0062202081|5.0|Book was in perfect condition!! Brand new and awesome price. Lots of info about Justin, and lots of colorful pics also! My daughter loved it!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My three year old daughter loves this game, she might not get it all but loves feeding the horses. It had great graphics.
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|This is the worst game ever you can't play 2  people at a time which stinks also  you will all ways win it is to easy
B009PEKRY6|5.0|After hearing &#34;Ready or Not&#34; and liking its beat, I decided to buy this album to hear the rest of her songs. I was not disappointed with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Although I prefer her acoustic performances which you can find on YouTube which have less pop characteristics, the songs on the album were still good to listen to. She has a rather unique singing style in that it is very rhythmic with a just a touch of hip-hop which actually accentuate her singing. Overall, while most of her songs deal with popular music topics like heartbreak and etc. they don't seem like generic ones that you will forget in a week or so.
1401300901|4.0|The story is so romantic and interesting. I like it way better than the movie. There are something's that are just better with your imagination :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to play, but I wish that you could buy more with coins rather than having to save gems for everything. Enjoyable regardless.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This has been said many many times but, this is the best game on the Vita in my opinion. It has an interesting story that combines RPG and anime elements into a perfect blend of fun and serious tones. There are new S Links to be established in the game over the PS2 release. This game has provided me with something that I have been missing which is some great turn based combat in which I can strategically select the actions of the characters unlike certain new entries into JRPG franchises (I'm looking at you Final Fantasy....). Persona is very niche, so to say that it isn't for everyone but if you miss a good ole' JRPG experience then this game is a must for you.
1934429821|4.0|I didn't know this author, but his illustrations were so good that I decided to investigate a little bit and this is a good biography book with good price. It seems the best work of this man is very expensive and rare to find... I would love a bigger type, but there are a lot of illustrations.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|I went into this expecting a combination of Starship Troopers and Blackhawk Down, but I came out wishing I had just watched Blackhawk Down again.  If you still want to watch this, I suggest skipping the first 20 minutes.  They're entirely unnecessary - it's like a race to hit every action movie character cliche they could think of, from the grizzled sergeant who's two days from retirement to the buck private who's about to get married to the brash young rebel who doesn't respect your authority.  The rest of the movie just rises to the level of mediocre, with a roughly equal balance of adequate action and tedious moments.<br /><br />I'd honestly be fine with all the cliches and the extraneous shaky-cam (During scenes where it's just two people sitting and talking? Really?) if they weren't constantly combined with an overwrought, super-serious score. The music in every scene of this movie seems to be saying, \\"These people are HEROES, America!  They are dying for your sins!\\"  I'd be okay with that in, say, Flags of Our Fathers, but it feels ridiculous in a movie about shooting guys in rubber bug-man suits (or their CGI equivalent).<br /><br />And I hope the real marines aren't this whiny -- \\"I know the fate of the Earth is at stake, but I still want to take a minute in the middle of this firefight to talk about my feelings!\\"

B0000042GM|4.0|I have these on vinyl and don't think that the digital remastering makes them sound significantly better on CD. Although it is nice to have the complete works, I find myself constantly distracted by the poor sound.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This introduces the shock of the Native Americans when that big white sail came over the horizion and the Spanish found the gold and oil. The love of nature, the belief of continuing on after death, the beauty of pure nature is stupendous in this fictional story.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As you say don't look for reality ,just interesting fast paced action and lots of planning<br />Just another good one. I recommend for fun and fast reading.
B0009XNUK0|3.0|The variety of songs was wonderful but the different recording sounds hindered the joy of all that was on this CD. But I do understand that recording music has changed tremendously throughout the years.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a great book and a wonderful story.  This book is full of hope.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A book filled with many surprises.  I could hardly put it down.  I would highly recommend the book.  I love Kate Morton's books.
0756655307|1.0|I totally get it about the whole super hero \\"movement\\" but if you are considering buying this book for a kid under the age of 21 AND you at all confess yourself to be a \\"christian\\" buyer beware, there are so many demonic undertones in this book that it may create spiritual warfare in your home. There is even a satanic 5 pointed star in the book. I had to send it back immediately as I'm not going to open a door into my kids mind, soul nor my house. I have to protect my child and set some boundries. I allow superhero's and all they represent to a degree but this book is way over the top for any child under 21.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I truly enjoyed this new perspective of Jesus the man. I chose to read this book because I was familiar with Reza Aslan's earlier work, No God but God, and appreciate his ability to intelligently tell his story in an easily understood format. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone whose mind is open enough to be able to separate and accept Jesus the man from Jesus the Religeous icon.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie stands out from the rest in the abundance of &#34;feel good&#34; moments that it has in it. It focuses only on the one family that doesn't get ripped apart by zombies and has its own interesting twists in finding the cure. On top of all this, there are some seriously cool action shots that only a genius writer could have thought up. In my opinion, this is Brad Pitts best movie yet.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Wow, what a sequel!  SOLID enough to stand on it  own as a towering piece  of 14th century historical fiction.  I was captivated with the story and ignored many of my daily tasks in order to continue reading.  I hope that this one is made into a miniseries as well; the Pillars of the Earth show was very well done.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Of course! Awesome chick flick! The book was great and the movie was great! I thought it was very entertaining.
B00166BL6Y|4.0|I've been a fairly big Jethro Tull fan since walking into a Hasting's Record Store in Corsicana, TX way back in 1980.  I was young, thought I knew everything about Rock...you know, the typical 18 year old.  While flipping through the albums, Kiss, Ted Nugent, The Cars and such, I noticed the music playing on the store sound system was something I'd never heard, in fact it was in a musical style I'd never heard.  It was smooth and pretty, with a very interesting vocal.  I kept shopping, but listening...finally I had to go ask the guy behind the counter who they were playing.  &#34;It's the new Jethro Tull album&#34;...and that's my introduction to Ian Anderson and the boyz.<br /><br />&#34;This Was&#34; was originally released in '68, way before I even had a care for Rock N Roll.  I probably purchased their &#34;This Was&#34; album in the mid to late 80's.  I recalled liking it, as it was just way more Bluesy than most anything else I'd purchased of the Tull catalog.  I probably had &#34;A&#34;, &#34;MU The Best Of&#34;, &#34;Broadsword And The Beast&#34; and &#34;Aqualung&#34;...at that tyme.  I was kind of surprised at the Blues sound, instead of all the flute leads.  At the tyme I was just starting to appreciate what Blues meant to Rock as I was starting to listen to Eric Clapton and was now beginning to understand what Led Zeppelin and Cream had done on some of those songs I really liked, but didn't really know what I was listening to.<br /><br />This new and updated release of &#34;This Was&#34; with two discs, one the original Mono the other updated Sterio Mix.  Overall I thought it was a purchase well worth the price.  You can get it cheaper than Amazon is offering it for though.  I'm sure neither disc is going to become a regular play at home or in the car, but it will get played.  It is good.  But, it is not &#34;Aqualung&#34; or really like any of the other Jethro Tull releases since.  I'm having difficulty recalling what &#34;Stand Up&#34; sounded like.  Ireally liked their rendition of Track Two &#34;Some Day The Sun Won't Shine&#34;, like the harmonica and overall blues feel.  Track Three &#34;Beggars Farm&#34; is an inkling of what and where Jethro Tull were headed.  &#34;Move On Alone&#34; is still a little bit on the English Blues side, but to me it is closer to being an R&B styled song of the tyme.  &#34;Serenade To A Cuckoo&#34; is a slow moving smooth instrumental highlighting Ian's new found instrument, the flute, and it's pretty good.  Track Six &#34;Dharma For One&#34; starts off featuring the flute, but then becomes a drum highlight which becomes a jazzy little sound towards the end of the song.  &#34;It's Breaking Me Up&#34; Very sweet Blues playing guitar and harmonica with good delivery...this might be my favorite song on the album, then maybe not.  &#34;Cat's Squirrel&#34; is a five minute instrumental that allows everyone an oppertunity to show off some of their skill.  It rocks at moments, but kind of bluesy at others.  &#34;A Song For Jeffrey&#34; is probably going to be the most familiar song from this album for anyone who's listened to some of the Tull Compilation Sets.  I really like the vocal delivery to this song.  &#34;Round&#34; probably a Jazzy flute type instrumental.  &#34;Love Story&#34; nice, maybe another one that shows where Ian and the boyz were headed.  The remainin tracks on this disc 2 are bonus tracks. &#34;One For John Gee is a nice instrumental.  All the bonus tracks are worth a listen.  Then I feel most of Jethro Tull's catalog is well worth a listen or two, most of it that I'm familiar with still gets played every now and again.  For anyone who is interested in finding something that is mostly the hits and familiar tunes, I'd highly recommend &#34;The Best Of Jethro Tull; The Anniversary Collection&#34; 36 songs for only $16, can't go wrong.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Unexpectedly thought it was fantastic.  I didn't really have very high expectations to start with, but, I thought it was great.  Leo does say one phrase that started to get annoying.  Other than that, I really enjoyed it!
B00007KWHP|5.0|Fragile (1972): Yes it is a Great Album, Yes it has some Classic Standards from the AOR FM radio days of my youth, Yes it is very well Produced.  As mentioned in previous reviews of Yes releases, I've had the &#34;Yes Album&#34; since 1980 and &#34;90125&#34; since it's release in '83.  Loved them both and they both got quite a lot of play on the old turntable and of course on a 90 minute Maxell cassette tape in the car.  Being that I never dove any deeper into the Yes catalog until mid 2013, I find myself judging all their other material against those two works of art.  I started to give &#34;Fragile&#34; four stars, because in my personal opinion I like the &#34;Yes Album&#34; and &#34;Close To The Edge&#34; and &#34;90125) just a bit better.  But, maybe that is not the proper way to view their work, so I'll just try and rate &#34;Fragile&#34; on its Own Merit.<br /><br />&#34;Fragile&#34; opens with a great song for any tyme period &#34;Roundabout&#34;, eight and a half minutes of sheer bliss.  &#34;Cans And Brahms&#34; is something that I might not have appreciated had I heard it back in my youth, yet it would have stuck with me through my musical evolution...it is just a short little lesson or Xperience in Classical Music, which might take an interested listener on another adventure.  &#34;We Have Heaven&#34; seems to fit well with the whole album flow, but if there is a cut on this album that is going to annoy the listener, this would be it.  It has a very repetitive, almost childish, line throughout the entire minute and forty seconds...I'm probably just missing an intended point. Track four &#34;South Side Of The Sky&#34; clocks in right at eight minutes.  I do not recall ever hearing this song played on the AOR FM stations.  I'm going to say this is one of those somewhat overlooked gems, that those in search of the next Popular song would dismiss, but those who actually listened to this album or tape straight through would have enjoyed Immensely.  I really have enjoyed finding this one. &#34;Five Percent For Nothing&#34; is a very short intrumental that just takes the listener from one song into the next.  That next song &#34;Long Distance Runaround&#34; which is another AOR FM Staple.  My only wish is that this song was another one of Yes's eight minute long works.  Great guitar, Great Song.  &#34;The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)&#34; follows, actually it pretty much is the closing of &#34;Long Distance Runaround&#34;, mostly an instrumental with an interesting smooth delivery of Schindleria Praematurus during the final fifty seconds.  So, you put &#34;Long Distance Runaround&#34; & &#34;The Fish&#34; together and you have a six plus minute song.  &#34;Mood For A Day&#34; Steve Howe introduces the listener to some samplings of what sounds like Spanish Guitar styled playing, it might be a European style...it is very pretty and easy on the ears.  It is little things like this that make listening to an entire album versus just picking through the popular hits so worth while...not all albums have that quality though.  Enjoy the ones that do.  Track Nine &#34;Heart Of The Sunrise&#34; is yet another overlooked gem that I have no recalection of ever hearing back when Yes was getting air play.  Could be it is a regional thing, but in the Dallas/Ft. Worth and Houston areas I never heard it.  This song could easily be considered Classic Yes, clocking in at eleven and a half minutes, and it just flows so smoothly.  At the closing of this song it has a connection to the ending of &#34;We Have Heaven&#34;...I don't personally understand the intent of the connection, but it is there and probably means something.<br /><br />The Bonus Tracks: &#34;America&#34; (Paul Simon), this is a ten and a half minute version of this cover.  Very good and I think I prefer this version to the shorter (Single Version)...but, that's just me.  Towards the end of &#34;America&#34; (9:50 mark) they quickly go into what sounds like a Santana Latin Drum rendition...kind of cool.  &#34;Roundabout&#34; (Early Rough Mix), I don't think most listeners would be able to distinguish this version from the original, to me it sounds pretty much the same...and that's good, real good.  Since I never listened to this album way back when, I have no reference point for what the album should really sound like, but I feel the two Bonus Tracks are welcomed additions to the original release.rum rendition...kind of cool.  &#34;Roundabout&#34; (Early Rough Mix), I don't think most listeners would be able to distinguish this version from the original, to me it sounds pretty much the same...and that's good, real good.

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was good.  I thought the end was entertaining with the twist.  I wouldn't watch it again, and I am glad I didn't see it in the theaters.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I'm nearly all the way through this newest Bridget Jones book. .I had to come here to figure out if it was just me that thought this book is no where near the level of the first two.  I'm not feeling the smart,  witty,  yet lifes-a-wreck Bridget of years back.  The writing isn't as clever,  it's almost hard to decipher what is going on.  I personally hate the turn the author chose to make here,  instead of a catch up type book with possibly a little twist,  it's depressing to see Bridget slogging into the next chapter in her life.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son fell in love with this mobile! It keeps his attention long enough to get some short jobs done around the house. I don't have any complaints about the product. I thought I was ordering a new item, but there was some dust and dirt in the crevices that suggested it wasn't new. I would have returned it, but I haven't seen it in any local stores. I cleaned it and used it. I will be hesitant to order any other baby toys from amazon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the back and forth style of the story set up.  What a sad, pathetic relationship evolved, with no peace in sight. They were together for all the wrong reasons.  I did not like the ending.
B00000IQV7|4.0|Bought for wife and grand daughter. Both enjoyed this movie. I really appreciate the fast shipping. Got it in time for the weekend.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved reading this book - love the story, and also the story within a story of Simon Snow. It was delightful - by turns funny and touching, and always nerdy in the best possible sense. I absolutely recommend Fangirl.<br /><br />Regarding the Kindle version: I'm perturbed to see that there are (at least on in my phone app) no italics within the text. I suppose I wouldn't know that if I didn't also have the hardcover... but it bothers me. Sometimes the specific word emphasis is IMPORTANT, oh ebook formatters -- I encourage you to fix it!

B002HR1W1K|5.0|Hot Fuzz is hilarious. That's not a cop-out or a lazy review, that's simply the best way to put it. It simultaneously is the epitome of and sends up the action genre as a whole, referencing Shaun of the Dead, Bad Boys, Point Break, James Bond, and countless other action classics and tropes.<br />Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing, and when combined with Edgar Wright, they are simply unstoppable. Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest movies out there.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This movie is being filmed in my hometown with nick dunne being played by Ben Affleck and Tyler perry being played by nick dunne's attorney . I am loving the film and I'm a extra in the movie. Yes I'm going to be in the movie how.awesome is that. But any way this is a awesome read and I love it so many twists and turns. But a awesome read.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|Loved the first book....wanted to love this book.  It was so so so boring...I literally skimmed through half of it and didn't miss a thing.  I'm not even bothering with the 3rd book at this point.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|but this one is good.  had to add it to the collection.  still like the first few seasons better.  it was more about being funny rather than jumping into each others beds.
B000002JSN|5.0|If I were to meet someone who had never heard of Led Zeppelin, had never listened to any of their music, and wanted to know who they were, I would send them first to _Physical Graffiti_.<br /><br />The entire scope and range of their truly astounding music prowess is contained in this record.  No other single album from their career can compete with it in that regard.<br /><br />I actually think this is a better record than the Beatles' white album, and that's high praise!  Once a highly successful band embarks on a multi-LP recording, it's all too easy to allow that extra space -- not to mention the latitude granted by the label -- to allow for some overindulgence… think &#34;Honey Pie&#34; and &#34;Revolution 9&#34; from _The Beatles_, or a good bit of The Clash's _Sandinista!_.<br /><br />There's none of that here.  Even when they push the envelope -- for example on &#34;Kashmir&#34; and &#34;In the Light&#34; -- they manage to stop just short of excess and rein you in right when you feel you're about to go spinning off into the stratosphere and losing the grove.  Perhaps only the Grateful Dead are better at riding that edge than are Led Zep on those tracks.<br /><br />But the bulk of it consists of solid rockers, their trademark crunchy blues rock, some wonderful acoustic numbers, and just plain fun stuff.<br /><br />Rather than using the double-LP format to indulge their extremes, they used to serve up some truly wonderful material that simply hadn't fit on previous records, in the way  that Tom Waits later would for his &#34;all shake&#34; triple disc album _Orphans_.<br /><br />Look, here's the thing…. if you're into '70s rock, get this album.  If you're into Led Zeppelin, get this album.  If you're into good popular music, get this album.  If you're into rock and roll, get this album.<br /><br />That's really all there is to it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great Stephen King read. It's right up there with the shining and bag of bones! Scary and yet sorta warm. You don't have to have read THE SHINING to get the story but it really enhances the read.Now we know what happened to little Danny(Doc) Torrance

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I found the book to be extremely informative on Wash,D.C. history.<br />The climax was totally unexpected.<br />The anti-climax and throughout the book there were many thought provoking statements. I found myself nodding my head at some of the comments. Things I had previously thought and different ways of looking at life and the afterlife.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Great picture, excellent plot. Cinematography is outstanding. Orlando Bloom was an excellent choice for the main actor. Liam Neeson did a credible job as his father.

B008K7RGA2|5.0|I’ll start by admitting that I’m not a fan of the voice of Bryn Terfel. He just doesn’t have that lyric quality required of Italian opera lead players. But, then, he’s not a lead. However, I must also give credit, where it’s due. Scarpia is a rogue, miscreant and rapist, who gets his pleasure from making others miserable. Terfel’s physical characteristics, combined with his depiction of Scarpia’s personality, provides the most realistic and honest Scarpia I’ve ever seen. Terfel’s facial expressions and tone of voice, as he spoke to Tosca or anyone else, could not have been more accurate. His bass/baritone voice was, also, just perfect, for this role. He is as perfect, for Scarpia, as was Maria Callas, for the title role, in the 1964 Tosca. If you’re old enough (yes, I’m an old guy), to have enjoyed Callas’ live performance of Tosca, you were fortunate. It was one of her last, at her peak.<br />Angela Gheorghiu’s voice is still excellent, in this opera, although you can hear that she is just a hair’s breadth past her peak. Nonetheless, the only voice, which was better, in this role, so far, was that of Callas. Unfortunately, the audio and video recording technology of Callas’ era did not preserve the quality of Callas’ live performance; although, if you’re fortunate enough to own the 33⅓ RPM vinyl LP of the Callas’ studio production of Tosca, you have gold. The only one I think may do a better job of Tosca is Anna Netrebko and, if she ever decides to tackle the role of Tosca, you can bet that I’ll be standing in line, to purchase that one.<br />Jonas Kaufman, as Cavadossi, is at his vocal peak and absolutely excellent.

B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|At first was worried about the spoiler of Darcys death but after reading it realized that it had to be done. There would be no way I would have been interested in the book if Bridget had a happily ever after. Life isn't like that, it has it's ups and downs. I know some readers thought that Bridget acted too young and immature but in my experience no matter what age you still have those same insecurities as when you were young no matter how latent. I fell in love with this older Bridget just the same way I fell in love with 30something Bridget. Must read !

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The action was non stop, even though Pendergast seems invincible.  I thought the Corrie Swanson story line was a good diversion from the other characters.  The description of the car salesmen was perfect, especially for anyone who has looked at cars recently.  I can't wait for the next one.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I'm not much of a movie-goer, but I like Judi Dench so I picked this up on the recommendation of a co-worker and what a nice surprise.  Well written, directed and acted by everyone involved.  I now have four all-time favorite movies: Gone with the Wind, 2001 a Space Odyssey, Airport (the original - not any of those awful knockoffs) and now this.

B00DSTBMMU|2.0|Admittedly, I'm not much of a fan of pop-country.  Sheryl sounds like she's doing an Emmylou Harris impersonation, then a Loretta Lynn impersonation.  It has what I don't like about most modern country-- affected voices and accents that aren't the singer's real voice.  While there are a few clever and funny lyrics, the album suffers from too much trite cookie-cutter country writing, as well-- thematically, and in the lyrics chosen.  I'm sure Sheryl had some songs saved up that were just too country for her other albums (which often have a bit of pedal steel or Tele twang), and as the album title implies, an old affinity to country music.  But except for maybe one song, she never really sings her heart out in her own, full voice.  That voice has been evident on her albums/tours that emphasized rock, pop and R&B/blues, and it gets lost in the country genre.  Or else I just hate trite pop country so much that it means this is the first album of hers I don't like.  Anyway, I'm glad I borrowed this one, and bought all the rest.  I give it a two because I love Sheryl Crow and can't bear the thought of giving her a bad rating for anything but taste in men.

B00A5IXI7O|1.0|I watched this after reading the book.  There were no women in the book.  There was nothing but women in this film.  Hitchcock absolutely ruined a very engaging book by not only sexualizing everything and everyone, but also by completely overhauling the plot.  Emptied it of its substance, I was constantly explaining to my family what was going on and why.  Without knowing the book, they were barely hanging on.  I am as disappointed as anyone ever is after reading a good book only to have the film come along and trash it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I hope the movie is as good as the book. I loved it and couldn't put it down. I knew there would be a twist in the middle, but never would have guessed it would have turned out like it did. Definitely give it a try!

B009NFHF0Q|2.0|After reading The Graveyard Book, I expected something very different. This was confusing and I'm still not sure what it all meant. I wanted a light hearted fun to read book- this was not it!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This album is sure to grow on you. Ive been a Korn fan since i was 13. With the return of head, korn went back to their signature sound. Im not a huge fan of electronics. Path of totality was a bit too much for me. There were a few good songs from that album. However, they should have left it as an EP. There electronics all iver this record. Unlike path of totality, they're blended into the music instead of overpowering the bass and guitars. Couple of my favorite tracks are victimized, punishment time, I wasn't born yesterday (bonus track).<br />The dvd is well worth it. It's an hour long documentary. Any true korn fan will buy the deluxe package instead of only watching \\"reconciliation\\" through youtube. The dvd goes into head coming back to the band. Inside the studio with pre-production and actual studio recordings.<br />Great to have head back! They seem so refreshed and awakened! Can't wait to hear what's next!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game and lots of fun to play..still waiting for the new update to hit the kindle so hurry up so can enjoy more
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|I have been a Trivium fan since ascendancy and a dedicated fan since shogun. VF is a great collection of what they have done and where they are going with future albums. The production value is top notch. Mathews vocals are stronger than ever, the music is more aggressive than their previous effort (in waves....I absolutely love in waves), another bass solo from Paolo. I dont think it's fair to pick any favorites,  but I will name 3...at the end of this war, through blood and dirt and bone and finally villainy thrives. These three songs have creative vocal patterns and awesome lyrics (villainy thrives).<br /><br />For some, this record might need to grow on you. At least give it a chance!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Holy freaking SHeeeiiite! This book is AMAAAAZING! Chock full of weirdos, psychics, crazed killers, losers, and one beautiful girl with the Shining in spades. I really liked that King finally wrote about his own experience of addiction and recovery through the character of Dan Torrance. As they say in the 12 step program:<br />FEAR: face everything and recover.

B005723JSQ|5.0|You can find this review and others on my co-owned blog Boricuan Bookworms [...]<br /><br />I had seen this book numerous times in Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, in endless places! And I thought, \\"Hey, this looks like a good book\\", and bought it.<br /><br />The story starts with the main character, Poppy Wyatt (Yes, that's her name), and she lost her engagement ring! :O To top it off, it's a heirloom, and she's meeting the brainy and intimidating in-laws that afternoon. Plus, her phone got nicked (robbed), the only medium to contact her if when they find her ring, plus her life. \\"Relax Poppy, stay positive! It's not the end of the world\\" might not be enough. When she finds a lonely-some phone in a bin, it's public property, so she snatches it! The downside of it, it has an owner of a really important business who's not willing to share. From wedding issues and business catastrophes, things do take a turn when you share a phone.<br /><br />I found it to be a weird kind of story, since I didn't find at first how the book could have any story at all when Poppy was already going to marry and all that. As soon as she finds the ring, it ends. But no. This story takes you to more than that. We see how this perfectly happy character turns to be insecure, but independent at the same time. Funny, caring, sensitive, and always there to help, even if it doesn't turn well some times. And Sam Roxton... *drools* You can see more of what I think in the first My Perfect Boyfriend Meme. He's very straight-forward, but generous and kind at the same time.  And sexy... Some times one would think he's a snob of a business man, but he isn't. That's his way of being on work, but outside, with Poppy, he's different.<br /><br />“Getting something out of him is like getting blood out of a stone”.<br /><br />(Probably the funniest thing that describes him hehehe...)<br /><br />The themes are really fantastic. We see various aspects as to how people can be around others that make them feel inferior, and how one should react to those situations. How a misunderstanding can change your whole view of something, and how we have to take things slow; not to get overwhelmed with the moment and not think it through.<br /><br />The plot in general was okay, kind of like mixing humor and crime/mystery--something like Stephanie Plumb but with its own unique style--plus bits and pieces of romance here.<br /><br />The characters were astounding. Other than Sam and Poppy, I loved the in-laws, parents of  Magnus. Sophie Kinsella made them look so annoying and dislikeable, it was amazing. I like it when an author manages to do that, to make you think a certain way of characters that are the \\"bad guys\\" in a way.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good novel for you to laugh, smile like an idiot in the middle of the night (guilty), and have a good time. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes  a good chick lit book with romance and plenty of humor. And if not, then try it either way cos this was my second book of chick lit and I liked it haha.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Review by Jennifer Madero :)
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Love it! Vince Gill is the best!<br />What a voice.What a guitar player!<br />Met my expectations and then some.<br />He seems to just get better with age,like a fine wine.<br />His band has been with him for years.They are all so excellent.<br />So happy with this purchase!
B0027MJU00|5.0|O.M.G. What a mindblowing novel Gosh! Wow wow wow just freaking wow. A hundred rounds of applause to Gillian Flynn please. A thousand times better than I expected of this. I even cried--dunno why haha--when I discovered who did it. I even pounded on my bed and screamed \\"I knew it!\\". Well, I knew half, but the other was so obvious; right in front of my face! I am pumped to read more of this author, hopefully soon. And more crime books. I love em now.<br /><br />You can find this review and others in my co-owned blog Boricuan Bookworms [...]<br /><br />I've never read a book with the themes of Crime, Mystery, and Thriller as the main things (that I remember).  But I had heard so many good things about Gillian Flynn, I had to read one of her books. Since Gone Girl wasn't on sale on the store, I picked this one up.<br /><br />Libby Day is the only survivor of a massacre that killed her mom and two older sisters, all apparently done by her fifteen-year-old brother as part of a satanic ritual. She testifies that he killed them and he's sent to jail, while she's handed down to everyone from aunt, and a lesser group of relatives--second cousins and great-aunts and friends of friends--again and again. All this every year until she's eighteen-years-old to inherit $321,374 as a result of all well-wishers who'd read the poor story of little-seven-year-old Libby Day. That is, until she's thirty something, after 24-almost-25 years later, she's running out of money. No job, no studies, just a little house; she has to find a way to make more cash. And it ain't growing from trees. But it comes easy when the Kill Club offers her money to join one of their meetings to discuss the mystery of the unresolved \\"Satan Sacrifice\\" she lived. Maybe not so easy, because while trying to earn more money, she meets with the one person she always doubted to see, her brother Ben, and try to find once and for all the true murderer of her family.<br /><br />From the first line, I was hooked. I knew this books was one I was going to enjoy. I admit I was  a bit skeptical with the whole Satanist issue in the description because I don't like to read of those things. But that barely ever appears, at least not as the main focus, just one of the things that make you suspicious of who's the real bad guy. From the latest books I've read, most of the heroines are pretty normal gals that are nice or normal. Not Libby. Even she admits it.<br /><br />I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it. It's the Day Blood. Something's wrong with it. I was never a good little girl, and I got worse after the murders.<br /><br />From the beginning we have this image of Libby Day and how mean she is. But how much? I liked her characters so much. She was this girl that didn't care so much as to anyone, didn't care about the world, was mean and selfish, and still, she was so frail and sensitive to when it came to her family, but also mean about them too at times. We was so wonderfully made into this three-dimensional character that you can't help but like and feel appealed to because of her situation and how she manages.<br /><br />The rest of the characters were also made pretty solidly. You saw them as they are with their obvious traits, but you also had in mind how Libby saw them, and even if it felt wrong, you still felt strongly about disliking them! And that shows me how great Gillian Flynn is in her writing to make me be the character and not only read about him or her. And the sisters, Michelle and Debby along with Libby, these aren't good girls. They might be younger than ten-years-old, but these aren't the nice girls with pigtails you see in movies as being angels. These girls are so twisted, you won't be able to imagine all kids as being innocent. Along with the rest of the small girls mentioned in the book. There's no pretty covering-up here.<br /><br />Not all authors canmanage to make the different point of view thing work, but since this is a crime and thriller story it helps to keep the reader more on edge. One point is Libby's as of now this day, another is of Ben Day and Patty Day, the mother. These last two appear as the day of the accident goes by until it happens and you see it all FINALLY. But as Libby goes uncovering tracks to see who is the murder, you get these hints and clues from Ben and Patty, that only make you doubt even more! It's amazing how one thing can lead to another until you have a big mix of disastrous proportions that make everything go to h*ll and back. How a tiny thing to your eyes can be bad to another's.<br /><br />This book made me want to read more crime and thriller stories. Which I've been keeping at a distance because I thought they were boring. They're not. Or maybe it's all part of Gillian Flynn's magic writing style.<br /><br />Another thing were the descriptions. Nothing here is censored or painted as pink lilies and magic and fairies NONE AT ALL. The descriptions are so vivid, bloody and disgusting it makes it all the more real and make you feel inside the story. Here's an example without spoilers :<br /><br />\\"More potent nightmares followed: Michelle was cooking pancakes, and grasshoppers were floating in the batter, their twig legs snapping off as Michelle stired. They got cooked into the pancakes, and my mom made us eat them anyway, good protein, crunch, crackle. Then we all started dying--choking, slobbering, eyes floating back into our heads--because the grasshoppers were poisoned. I swallowed one of the big insects and felt it fight its way back up my throat, its sticky body surfacing in my mouth, squirting my tongue with tobacco, pushing its head against my teeth to escape.\\"<br /><br />If you like a good crime and mystery suspenseful novels keeping you on edge, read this. Though, I don't think this kind of book should be read by anyone young if they aren't mature enough to deal with strong topics like sex, dead, language, and behavior. Plus descriptions like the ones above. However, they aren't too frequent, but some don't like them nonetheless.  Also, to people who are strongly affected by the emotions conveyed by the author, like hate for example. I was warned to read this around happy people because some of the readers get gloomy with this read. If you are like this, read it around happy settings. If not, you'll be good enough.<br /><br />And last but not least, that ending. OH GOD THAT FREAKING ENDING! I cried in that ending. Not because it was sad, or happy, or anything at all. I cried because IT WAS SO OBVIOUS.<br /><br />The suspense in this novel is so strong, there are so many suspects you have no idea if to think Libby was the killer and she didn't remember or if Ben is the real one, or someone else. You are clueless until the last few chapters things are more clear but still it isn't. It's amazing. Truly amazing. And I cried because I knew it, in a way. I suspected at least, among the very long list of my other suspects... I think my mom heard me scream when I ended it and all was freaking clear.<br /><br />Rating: 5 BIG AND FAT stars
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As always this was a good read.  I've read 'The Shining' multiple times and watched both movie versions more than once.  So it's good to have some closure.<br /><br />Some elements of the story seem to have been lifted wholesale from 'Salem's Lot'.  And 'SL' was mentioned several times in this story.  Was King recycling old ideas and thumbing his nose at us, or providing continuity?<br /><br />Read it and decide for yourself.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|It normally takes me a few listens before I really start loving songs, very few ever catch me the first time.  This album is no different and if you aren't a huge fan after one or two tries, give it a little more time.... they'll grow on you.  I'm currently LOVING Pendulum and Yellow Moon, which are unique and nothing really like anything I've heard before.  Both songs have a wonderful atmospheric sound to them.<br /><br />Sirens, Mind Your Manners, Getaway, Future Days, Lightning Bolt, & Infallible are also excellent tunes.  I think most of these songs will sound great live, which is the most important thing for PJ fans who go to shows.  Sirens is a lovely ballad with a nice guitar solo (hoping for extended solos live ie Crazy Mary and Rearviewmirror).  Mind Your Manners is a quick, short, punk song which sounds better the louder it gets.  Future Days is a beautiful, emotional ballad reminiscent of The End and Just Breathe off the last album.  Getaway, LB, and Infallible are all great rock tunes which keep the pace of the album from getting too slow and are easy to digest.<br /><br />Not a huge fan of Swallowed Whole or My Father's Son yet, but I might get there someday.  They seem to have some potential, but I just don't gravitate to them.<br /><br />The only two tracks I don't like are Let the Records Play and Sleeping By Myself.  The first is catchy, but I just am not a fan and the music sounds like ZZ Top with a country twang.  Maybe it'll be a hit at the country line dancing bars, I don't know.  Sleeping By Myself is actually a really good song, on Eddie Vedder's Ukulele Songs album.  Here it is too poppy and almost happy sounding, which just sounds weird to me after hearing the stripped-down original about 50 times. People who haven't heard the original will probably appreciate it more.  If they were going to borrow an EV solo tune, I'd rather have seen what they could have done with an Into the Wild song.<br /><br />The album is definitely harder/faster/morerocking at the start and really softens up at the end.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent as always.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this album and I think it will hold well up over time, especially compared to the more recent Pearl Jam albums.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|The ensuing is my own track-by-track take on Elton's new album followed by an overall summary of it as a whole. It's a long read, but hopefully you'll still be awake by the end of it. Enjoy!<br /><br />Classic ★★★★★<br />Excellent ★★★★<br />Good ★★★<br />Mediocre ★★<br />Poor ★<br /><br />1. Oceans Away<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Weight of the World\\".<br />\\"Eight Hundred Dollar Shoes\\".<br />\\"I Need You to Turn To\\" or \\"First Episode at Hienton\\" in the piano playing style of the second verse.<br />· A sparse, beautiful homage to WWII vets and the elderly that sets the tone for the rest of The Diving Board: This is Elton's show, and no one else's. His singing here is emotive, intimate at points and sounds quite sincere. It's a much more inspired opener, in my opinion, than \\"Weight of the World\\" on Peachtree Road; maybe not as good as \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" on Songs from the West Coast, but certainly on a par with \\"Postcards from Richard Nixon\\" on The Captain & the Kid.<br /><br />2. Oscar Wilde Gets Out<br />Rating: ★★★★1/2<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Come Down in Time\\".<br />\\"Where to Now, St. Peter?\\".<br />\\"The Trail We Blaze\\".<br />\\"Hell\\" (Made in England outtake).<br />Something from Fleetwood Mac or Billy Joel.<br />· One of my faves on this disc. A bit wordy, but I love the dark lyric, haunting piano lick and angry vibe in this one... it feels engulfed in a sense of sadness. The absolute best part is the staccato-pumped bridge where Elton and the 2CELLOS go all-out in intensity.<br /><br />3. A Town Called Jubilee<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Ballad of a Well-Known Gun\\".<br />\\"Rotten Peaches\\".<br />· This is one of those that's had to grow on me with repeated listens. Great, rousing chorus with a slight sense of urgency and some vibrant imagery throughout the rest of the song. I especially like the airy verses, immensely clever piano playing underpinning the chorus and his equally fancy piano playing in the instrumental.<br /><br />4. The Ballad of Blind Tom<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Not a Tea Dance\\" from the Billy Elliot demos.<br />· An aggressive, punchy and dramatic piece backed by a driving rhythm. The cinematic lines are some of the best on the entire album. There's sneaky backing vocals going on over in the left channel of the chorus here if you haven't noticed. The melody, and rather the chorus, does bear an initial and slight resemblance to \\"Not a Tea Dance\\" - but once you get over that then it really doesn't matter because \\"Blind Tom\\" itself is just so alluring. I think what really would have made this one for the ages is Elton just going completely mental with a song-ending piano solo from another planet... oh well!<br /><br />5. Dream #1<br />Rating: ★★★<br />· A piano interlude that ends somewhat abruptly, yet it's decent enough and I tend to look at it as just a nice palette cleanser. Nothing special.<br /><br />6. My Quicksand<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Someone's Final Song\\".<br />\\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\".<br />\\"Make Me As You Are\\" from the Lestat demos.<br />\\"Nothing Here\\" from the Lestat demos.<br />· The weakest link at first; not an instant pleaser... but it grows on you with each listen. It's complexity brings to mind Blue Moves' deepest and most serious material: dark, European stuff that's painful (in a good way) and heavy to listen to. And just imagine a younger Elton singing this one; it's so good... his current raspy vibrato can be so distracting at times to the point where it unfortunately doesn't serve this one much justice, depending on a person's tastes of course. But that jazzy instrumental section is 'out of left field' alright on an otherwise classical-leaning track.<br /><br />7. Can't Stay Alone Tonight<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\".<br />\\"I Know Why I'm in Love\\".<br />\\"Take Me Back\\".<br />\\"Turn the Lights Out When You Leave\\".<br />· The most accessible song on the CD. It's rock-solid with superb hooks and a breezy, country feel. Bouncy, swaying and instantly catchy with vocals sort of resembling Neil Diamond's in a way (!). The lyric is trite by Bernie's standards, but Elton reaches deep down into his bag of killer chords to make it work somehow. I believe it's the perfect followup single to \\"Home Again\\"; whereas \\"Home Again\\" is slow, serious and somber, CSAT is just the complete opposite: midtempo, loose, casual and a real toe-tapper. An AC radio Top 12 single, at the very least.<br /><br />8. Voyeur<br />Rating: ★★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Rocket Man\\" (live).<br />\\"The Retreat\\" in those last few seconds at the very end.<br />· The centerpiece of the album; it's an enchanting thrill ride that builds to a fever pitch before finishing off with a similar, if not identical piano lick from the `80s B-side \\"The Retreat\\". Deceptively colorful bass playing here and a booming bass drum in that echoing coda. Bernie's most intriguing lyric and perhaps Elton's most ambitious vocal in the entire set, but too sophisticated to be a single... it needs an actual chorus in order to achieve any measure of success on the radio. Despite that, it's the one song on TDB that I'll consider to be a truly classic album cut.<br /><br />9. Home Again<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"The Bridge\\".<br />\\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\".<br />\\"The One\\".<br />\\"Gone to Shiloh\\".<br />\\"Tonight\\" in those last climbing piano notes at the very end.<br />· Well-crafted with a feeling of longing; it's soaring chorus sticks in your head as it grows on you with repeated listens. It's a really nice reminder of or tip-of-the-hat to other lead singles from the past such as \\"The One\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\", and his pianosolo in this one is probably the most attention-grabbing on the entire LP.<br /><br />10. Take This Dirty Water<br />Rating: ★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"If There's a God in Heaven (What's He Waiting For?)\\".<br />\\"Boogie Pilgrim\\".<br />· Suffice to say, it hasn't grown on me. The lone misfire here and a near dud in my book; its strength comes from being a `mood' piece rather than as a nuanced standout with satisfying twists & turns like the others. Lightweight, with a repetitious and almost monotonous melody. Solid performances all around though, and I know there are some people out there who think it should be a single, but it's not adventurous at all and a bit of a throwaway... sorry.<br /><br />11. Dream #2<br />Rating: ★★★<br />· Another pretty, short piano interlude that basically serves as another palette cleanser, but just a little more developed this time around.<br /><br />12. The New Fever Waltz<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Belfast\\".<br />\\"Seasons\\".<br />\\"Carla/Etude\\".<br />· In terms of painting a vivid picture, it captures some of that old Elton magic from his early years. Charismatic and enticing, and the arrangement on it is captivating without being overwhelming. Lovely.<br /><br />13. Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)<br />Rating: ★★★1/2<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"The Wasteland\\".<br />\\"They Call Her the Cat\\".<br />\\"Just Like Noah's Ark\\".<br />· Another lightweight tune, yet it's miles more interesting both lyrically and melodically than \\"Take This Dirty Water\\". An obviously decent amount of energy in a blues jam that just lacks pizzazz; there is a groove here which sounds way too familiar, so that there may lay the problem. Surprisingly enough, it's still undeniably one of the more commercial-sounding tracks on an otherwise uncommercial album.<br /><br />14. Dream #3<br />Rating: ★★★★<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Madman Across the Water\\".<br />\\"Sixty Years On\\".<br />· The third and final piano interlude, and the most innovative one at that. Tension-filled and stark, and the most developed of the three... it's the definition of musical excellence and the gold standard of which we've all come to expect from Elton as far his skills on the keyboards go.<br /><br />15. The Diving Board<br />Rating: ★★★★1/2<br />Son(gs) of Your Father or reminiscent of:<br />\\"Blue Eyes\\".<br />\\"Idol\\".<br />· \\"Blue Eyes\\" reincarnated. His vocal phrasing here is sassy and full of swag, and the song just glides, dips and darts its way into your breaking heart with this one burning question: 'Fame and fortune may be awaiting you, but are you ready for fame and fortune?' One of his most mature recordings to date.<br /><br />Bonus tracks:<br />1. 5th Avenue: ★★★★1/2<br />· Ambient, classy and regretful. Definitely worthy of inclusion on the LP as a replacement for \\"Take This Dirty Water\\".<br /><br />2. Gauguin Goes Hollywood: ★★★1/2<br />· Sweeping and romanticized, with some cool horns and strings peppered in. Slightly more engaging than \\"Candlelit Bedroom\\".<br /><br />3. Candlelit Bedroom: ★★★<br />· A tad pedestrian but still pleasant nonetheless; a poor man's \\"I Want Love\\".<br /><br />Album rating: ★★★★ (4.25 rounded down to 4.0)<br />· By a slim margin, The Diving Board is Elton's best studio album since at least 2001's Songs from the West Coast. It is an effort that is way more impressive artistically and greater as a textured whole rather than the sum of its parts. If anything, this album deserves praise for having the balls to defy most casual fans' ideals and expectations of what a typical latter day Elton John record should be, which is instantly likeable pop music that is ultimately underappreciated and decisively forgettable in the long run. TDB \\"feels\\" poignant and isn't aimed at a lowbrow audience, and it begs to be memorable and much longer-lasting in people's consciousness with repeated listens. Itevokes fond flashbacks to both Elton's '70s and early '00s output, particularly albums such as Elton John (1970), Tumbleweed Connection (1971), Madman Across the Water (1971), Blue Moves (1976) and the aforementioned SFTWC - yet it ultimately establishes a distinct identity of its own as a confident, 2013 version of Elton looking to think a bit outside the box and create a set focused more on substance rather than commerce or pleasing the masses.<br /><br />With that said, if this album lacks anything - it's missing the presence of that classic EJ sound, namely his touring band's backing vocals and Paul Buckmaster's string arrangements; and let's be honest: quite a few of the melodies here do ring like slight variations of songs he's done before. However, T-Bone Burnett does triumphantly fulfill his vision of a crisp, simple and warm production, and the reliably polished storytelling by the legendary John/Taupin songwriting team is immensely entertaining here.<br /><br />TDB is not anywhere close to being a masterpiece, however I do believe it's destined to be an enduring album that will be much more appreciated as time passes by those people who've already dismissed it for its supposed shortcomings.<br /><br />Next single: \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" (Radio Edit) 3:46<br />Song to remove: \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" out with \\"5th Avenue\\" in instead, and then \\"Home Again\\" switching places with \\"Voyeur\\" in the tracklisting:<br /><br />01. Oceans Away<br />02. Oscar Wilde Gets Out<br />03. A Town Called Jubilee<br />04. 5th Avenue<br />05. The Ballad of Blind Tom<br />06. Dream #1<br />07. My Quicksand<br />08. Can't Stay Alone Tonight<br />09. Home Again<br />10. Voyeur<br />11. Dream #2<br />12. The New Fever Waltz<br />13. Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)<br />14. Dream #3<br />15. The Diving Board.<br /><br />What's next: Elton's done his stripped-down, piano based album... so now what? I think his next step should be an attempt at a more pop/rock oriented sound, and an album along the lines of a Honky Château or SFTWC; perhaps also following Paul McCartney's lead on his latest in using multiple producers (T-Bone, Patrick Leonard and someone else?), and having Davey & Nigel play on several tracks with Buckmaster presiding over the string arrangements.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Don't normally give 5 stars as a movie rating but I was totally blown away with this. I heard it did horrible at the local box office which I understand. To that disappointment I still went for the Blu-Ray purchase and all I can say is that this movie is visually orgasmic. I won't spoil anything. All I have to say is at least watch it in high definition and you'll be amazed. The story was solid, action was on point, and overall it was a solid movie! Must Own!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Truly an amazing account of the author's  NDE.<br />It has all the more impact having been written by a noted neurosurgeon.

B009GIPDQS|4.0|It's entertaining - much like I'm sure the inevitable movie will be. I did enjoy this, I couldn't put it down. I do recommend the book
B005K01VZS|5.0|I just went through another loss in our family. Comfort and peace surrounded me when finishing the beautiful words. Thank you.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|ITS AWESOME I LOVE IT ITS MY FAVORITE GAME EVER I LOVE THE THREE OF THEM AND ITS MORE FUN IF YOU HAVE THE THREE OF THEM!
037032921X|3.0|I bought this book because I thought it would be a decent read, since it is a classic and all. My honest opinion is that it is not completely terrible... it is the only book in my life that I had no trouble putting down and even leaving half unfinished for months. The subject matter is obviously morose, the life of children told from the point of view of death himself. To heap on the misery they are poor well beyond todays standards of comprehension and living in the midst of war to boot. There is some great character development, but it all seems pointless. The writing is actually kind of fun and keeps you from being absolutely depressed. Not a good book to take along on vacation. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|reminded me of A war movie, so I didn't watch it at first, but the second time I was glad I did, allot of action, and special effects
B00821PCJS|5.0|Very entertaining and fast moving! A lot of twists and turns, and good character developments. It keeps you coming back for more.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|this turned out to be A good movie, A little slow at first, but it picked up, kept me entertained
B002WY65VU|5.0|Funny, witty and the actors did not let me down with moments I let out a laugh.  The story  flowed well, the actors portrayed their roles as if this really happened.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I try to read whatever my kids are reading, which can be an interesting exercise. My daughter loved this book. I had a hard time finishing it. The writing is better than your average dystopian teen romance, if a little overwrought at times. The concept is interesting and, I must admit, quite plausible. I found it to be somewhat tiresome, slow-moving, and lacking any real story other than &#34;girl living in awful society meets gorgeous rebel boy, falls in love(against the law), plots escape&#34; which we've seen before. The theme, I guess, is &#34;teen true-love conquers all.&#34; Being a middle-aged adult this sort of thing gets old really fast. But for teens, it's the cat's meow. The author knows her audience.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I do not give 5 stars. Just this once. I am 70 and a librarian. No one could guess how much I have read.  It is the humanity in this story that lifts it above even the best of memoirs including Mary Karr, Cheryl Strayed.
0783233477|5.0|The acting was superb and it was an interesting story... certainly different but attention=binding.  I certainly would recommend it very highly.
B000005HFH|5.0|This excellent compilation takes me back to the 50's-60's if only for a while... As a lover of jazz/classical/reggae music coming of age in the pop/rock/rap 80's-90's era I have explored many ways to experience this romanticized period of time. Whether spending an evening at City Lights and Vesuvio reading, drinking and writing or listening to impromptu jazz in Alto Bario-Lisboa, Copenhagen, Amsterdam (and other European places), NYC, Chicago or even Fullerton - this music along with a good slow beer or two is the simplest way to get the feeling of that time period for me. Chet Baker's singing (which is often simple and raw but yet vulnerable - on the edge of...something) and horn/piano playing (fast/fun or slow/thoughtful) bounces back and forth between slower sad/reflective songs and faster hopeful/uplifting ones. His \\"living in the moment\\" style creates a powerful mood that must be experienced in the proper setting and mind set...enJoy!
B0014BY72Q|5.0|This movie is a blast from the past.  Though made in 1976, and some of the effects are obviously miniatures, the plot, action, and characters keep you involved.  Even in a &#34;perfect&#34; utopian society, people can lead hollow, meaningless lives.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It was better than I thought it was going to be. I really liked their take on the twist .
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This is a good entertaining Baldacci which for some reason seemed a bit uneven in pace. I liked the middle better than the beginning or the end.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Character acting very good. A suspenseful series in the first two seasons, season 3 is not as good, hope they are not going downhill.
039916409X|5.0|I've heard about EFT tapping for years and was always intrigued, but I just thought it seemed too lightweight to handle lifetime issues.  Not true!  Margaret is one of many EFT-related teachers out there but her work goes deep and seems to hit the 'sweet spot' of issues that have blocked a lot of people for years.  I've spent tens of thousands of dollars over my lifetime for therapy, workshops, healing sessions, books and CD's you name it-  and yet my problems persisted.  I won't say EFT made my life pain free or problem free BUT if you do the tapping work CONSISTENTLY and keep with it, something inside will shift that changes the way you relate to yourself and others.  I have no idea how tapping on meridian points can shift a lifetime of dysfunctional thinking but it's a very powerful tool if you do it consistently.  Things that used to push my buttons now barely register.  I don't feel so overwhelmed by my past and have been able to move on from things that used to work me up into a lather for days.  I was my own jail keeper and kept myself shut down and locked away for decades.  When I really started to tap on the old hurts and fears and shames and kept digging at these thoughts/issues as they surfaced, something shifted inside.  Yes, I'm still me but with a hell of a lot less internal baggage.  Try this book.  You have nothing to lose but a few bucks and a some time spent on tapping sessions.  And then promise yourself you will do the work and stick with it, that's the hardest part but it's the deal maker or deal breaker.  But if you do this work, there's freedom on the other side.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|I can't believe Del Toro chose this over The Hobbit. A jumble of CGI effects put together around a poorly conceived plot.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it for travel!<br /><br />Blue screen does not blind me at night.<br /><br />I like all the different options for screens and alarms.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a great way to pass the time. if you can't own a horse this is the  best way.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I just had to put this one down.  Clary drives me nuts!  She totally ignores everyone's advice, and constantly does things she's been specifically told not to do!<br />It's like she has no self control, and just does whatever pops into her mind.<br />Nevermind that people can get hurt or killed by her stupidity, she's gonna do it anyway.<br />Besides that the book was fine.  I just want to grab Clary and tell her to stop and think!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Wonderful characters.....fascinating story that is well told......<br /><br />Thank you for the great books that you have written....I'm always sorry when the book ends...
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Charlotte Bronte is the consummate story teller. A story of loss, love and redemption.. is it any wonder that it has been a favorite of so many over the years, and has been presented so many times in movie and television specials. This is a story that one can read again and again and enjoy it thoroughly.
1742204147|5.0|I got this book for traveling in Japan for a month, and it really helped my allot planning! It has many useful tips, and what I really liked was suggestions of what to do in each city. When it came to Tokyo I had some trouble, because the city is so insane big so I got lost several times. The pull out map of the metro system helped some. But this map is not the entire truth, as it's impossible to get all details there. If I could want for something more in these guidebooks it definitely would be more pull out maps! In Tokyo you might need to buy a better map or use a GPS since the city is so insane big and complex. Would have been nice if the \\"survival\\" tips was collected more in front instead of here and there. The layout of the book is excellent with nice pictures to give you some ideas.
B001TKK39S|1.0|My one-star rating has nothing to do with the music contained herein. The reason I'm so negative is that this box contains CD-R's rather than CD's. One can tell this by Sony's CD-R symbol which is located just above the bar code. It looks like a backwards letter &#34;C&#34; made with the stroke of a paintbrush. Shame on you, Sony, for not being clearer about this--in fact, shame on you for issuing CD-R's at all! And shame on you, Amazon, for not making this clear to your customers--but then again, you tend to always be shady when it comes to this issue.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed this first film of Despicable Me, characters were all funny and refreshing, and I don't usually like animated films too much, but this one was special!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|For someone who is very scattered often, this is helpful to be able to visually check how low the battery is.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|I purchase this item for my son's 6th birthday.  He had great fun assembling the set all by himself.  This set looks awesome and perfect to be used as a displayed object for my son's Ninjago themed party.  The box said it is for &#34;8-14&#34; year old children but it was not too difficult for my 6 year old son.  He completed the set with 2 hours and it gave him a great sense of achievement.  It is a bit pricey ($60) but I don't regret the purchase.  Totally recommended.
B000002USN|1.0|After I found out about both Duet sessions were not really duets but studio and technical composites, I gave both of my CD's away. I was just so disappointed.I also felt cheated. I'll just remember him with my older LPs/CDs.
1891252089|5.0|New to the style of yoga, I bought this book because my instructor uses it.  It has excellent photos of the sequence of poses and is very helpful when practicing Ashtanga yoga at home.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I am a musician, and this film touched home with me about how random the business can be.  But more than that, it was well produced, and the music included with the film was excellent.  It lead me to purchase the two CD's that Rodriguez had available again after all these years.  A humble man with a strong message, whose time had come in the 60's but not in his own country.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|The movie is great, which is why it gets five stars. But the collector's edition isn't worth it. Instead of a statue, it's movie case with an open back. And the statue itself is smaller than a regular DVD case. Don't spend the extra (at the time) $15.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|The kids watch this movie on every road trip we go on.  Great for family movie night!  Arrived quick and was watched just as quickly.
B008MM9630|1.0|The game kept freezing up or it would just close. Some if the time I could do anything at all. Do I deleted it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|love this chromecast , only one big draw back is there are not enough apps<br />google  said they are coming then i'd would give it the fifth star.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I have enjoyed this app.  The 5 by 5 grids are too simple for adults, but are great for children.  I have completed the 10 by 10 grids, and am about to start the 15 by 15 grids.  The 10 by 10 were fun but not too hard or tedious.  I got this as a FAOTHD and would recommend it.  Considering the enjoyment so far, you could do a lot worse for just $1.99.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|plays so well in the descendants movie, however it can stand out on its own laurel!<br /><br />it's like a drug..want more and more!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|She's great with all the little accessories you get. Would highly suggest for more of the double digit age group cause of all the smaller pieces.<br />If you dont have anything Sailor Moon but want something to satisfy your desire this is it.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I absolutely love the Blu-ray + UltraViolet sets they make these days. Plus a DVD is thrown in in-case you take is somewhere and they don't have a blu-ray player or if you expect to purchase a blu-ray player in the future and want the DVD now. And for the 3 viewing options you get with this product it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Totally worth it!<br /><br />Plus it's an amazing movie, what else could you want from it?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|My kids and I are easy-to-please users.  We aren't doing anything particularly demanding, so keep that in mind as I ooze enthusiastic about Chromecast.<br /><br />LIKES<br />--price.  Low price and it solves a lot of our demands.  We have more televisions than we need, and we now want to use them watch ChuggaConroy and other LPs; or Michelle Phan.  The Chromecast lets us do this from every laptop.<br /><br />--easy to install.  Okay, the hardware is super easy to install.  The software is bit stupid and doesn't have great directions, but even stumbling around like I did, it didn't take more than 10 minutes to set up.<br /><br />--once you have the Chromecast software downloaded, you can easily cast videos or whatever using the Chrome browser.<br /><br />--works on MACs, works on PCs.<br /><br />--LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that I can set something to cast to the TV, and it is possible to turn off the sound and action on the PC so I can continue to blow up jewels and/or piggies.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />--I wish the instructions had been a little clearer, but I think Google spends so much time making sure that no one can understand their SEO policies that they've forgotten how to write concisely.<br />--doesn't support 'locally' stored media<br /><br />We have simple needs and thus are VERY PLEASED with this inexpensive toy.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/fur-mom
B009LDD1X0|5.0|best comedy on tv, they play well together. They remind of the old<br />tv comedy of early tv, Good cast that you can tell that they love<br />what there doing.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I borrowed this movie from the library and really, really regret not seeing this in a movie theater. My mouth was agape throughout the entire movie. The scenery was so incredibly beautiful for an animated movie. The story is really cute as are all the characters. Great family movie.
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|Trivium is somewhat of a polarizing band among metal fans, have been since the release of \\"Ascendancy.\\"  I understand everybody isn't going to like any particular band, but I'm not sure I understand the vitriol behind some of the criticism they've received over the years.  It's obvious this band has an abundance of talent, and deserve respect for that alone, regardless of how you feel about their music.  Well, Trivium once again displays that talent indubitably on \\"Vengeance Falls.\\"<br /><br />First off, yes, David Draiman's influence on this album is noticeable; however, it's not too intrusive on Trivium's overall style and sound, at least in my opinion.  I'm not a big fan of Draiman or Disturbed, but his coaching of Matt Heafy seems to have added extra depth to Heafy's clean vocals. The guitar work is top notch as usual. Big fans of \\"Shogun\\" might be slightly disappointed as Trivium have once again chosen to forgo the intricate, technical and lenghthy song compositions displayed on that album for a catchier, more 'to the point' approach. To me, this is less of a weakness and more of an evolution as the album contains plenty of complexity to keep listeners enthralled throughout it's entirety. Nick Augusto has really grown on me and offers some good drum sections on this album. I still miss Travis Smith's drumming immensely, but Augusto's style works well with what the band is doing these days.<br /><br />The album gets things started quite nicely with one of the singles, \\"Brave This Storm.\\" Intense opening with a very catchy verse riff. \\"Strife\\" has one of the best choruses composed by the band. I'm not a fan of the production on Heafy's voice during the verse, but overall a great song, especially live. \\"Villainy Thrives\\" continues the trend of infectious choruses and the bridge contains an intense vocal barrage of threats to rapists, abusers and murderers. \\"Incineration: The Broken World\\" is easily one of my favorite Trivium tracks. From the great chorus and vivid lyrics to the crafty guitar rhythms and three consecutive solos, one being another fantastic bass solo from Paolo Gregoletto with Augusto's ferocious double bass laden drum attack in the background. Overall, not a perfect album, but a nice blend of all Trivium has offered us over the years. I give it a hard 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Standout songs on the album are, in no particular order, \\"Brave This Storm,\\" \\"Strife,\\" \\"To Believe,\\" \\"Villainy Thrives,\\" \\"Incineration,\\" and \\"Wake.\\"lyrics to the crafty guitar rhythms and three consecutive solos, one being another fantastic bass solo from Paolo Gregoletto with Augusto's ferocious double bass laden drum attack in the background. Overall, not a perfect album, but a nice blend of all Trivium has offered us over the years. I give it a hard 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Standout songs on the album are, in no particular order, \\"Brave This Storm,\\" \\"Strife,\\" \\"To Believe,\\" \\"Villainy Thrives,\\" \\"Incineration,\\" and \\"Wake.\\"
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm giving Chromecast 5 stars for 3 reasons:<br /><br />(1) It installed easily, using the adapter to fit in my TV's tight spot;<br /><br />(2) It set up and worked on the first try, seamlessly accepting my wi-fi; and<br /><br />(3) after weeks of use it's still working great, on the first try, every time I switch from TV mode to use it.<br /><br />This product is worth the $35 cost.<br /><br />You do need to be (somewhat) wi-fi literate because you need to get the Chromecast to &#34;talk&#34; to your wi-fi.<br /><br />All of this and Amazon also delivered it in just 3 days even when I selected free (longest) shipping.

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Once you get the motions down, this game is super fun and easy. My neighbor's kids absolutely love it and have tourneys whenever I bring out my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />**Note, Kindle Fire Users, you can turn off the &#34;Blow Airplane&#34; game by using the settings menu.**
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Classic movie, worth watching! I haven't finished yet but will soon enough. This is a Spielberg movie for those of you that don't know so there is quality in it. It's a fun little ride, beware there are some elements in the movie that are probably not suited for kids ages 11 and under. But that all depends on your child and how you choose to parent. The elements I speak of are language from a few of the kids, a kissing scene, and one of the characters is disfigured which I guess to some can be scary.
B006R1T40I|4.0|I have quite a few releases of Bonnie Raitt's and have loved them all. I hadn't purchased any releases of hers in the past 5-7 years and was missing some new sounds from her. I played this and it has the same sound of Nick of Time and Luck of the Draw (my favorites). I'm glad to add this to my collection,
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fantastic for the price. I don't remember seeing any ads except for the one asking me to rate the app, which I was happy to do because I have used it many times and it works well.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|One of the greatest, straight-up, action films I've seen in a long time. Literally, from the intro to the ending, every scene is written, performed and shot pretty darn spectacularly. And i can't forget to mention the imaginative music from the Chemical Brothers. They brought an interesting and dark feel to the film comparable to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.<br /><br />The cast is on point and the lead actors (Ronan, Bana, and Blanchett) perform above and beyond expectation. Don't waste any more time not watching this movie.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|I enjoyed watching the third installment of the Iron Man series. While its not as good as the previous two, I feel that you will enjoy it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very fun and hard to put down.  The only slightly negative that I have, is that the score for the game you just finished is hard to read behind the background of the &#34;you won&#34; overwrite.  I have only played it a few times, but all in all, I really am glad that I purchased this game.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well designed and works well with Google Chrome, YouTube, and Netflix.  The only draw back is the need for more apps for video streaming.  I have a Roku which has many apps but love the size and simplicity.
0792838068|5.0|I saw this movie on tv a few years ago in passing and fell in love. I love both the leads and was instantly rapt with the subject matter. This movie is very emotional and will leave you in tears by the end, however, it will cause you to think from beginning to end. This may sound a little morbid, but this movie is uplifting to me and causes me to realize that life is better than it looks.
B000002PC6|5.0|I have to admit I am a big big fan of ONJ, she put so much joy in my heart with her music in the 70's all the way through the 80's! My favorite Olivia song is \\" Make a move on me\\" I bought this album when it was first released in 1981, and still have it! No regrets when it comes to the lady that had the biggest song of the 80's which spent 10 weeks at No. 1, I love Olivia Newton John and always WILL!!!!!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I never thought I would find a really fun hunting game on my kindle fire HD, then I found this game! Trust me you will have a lot of fun with this game!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you like action you will enjoy this movie. Crank up the surround sound and immerse yourself in the action.  A very enjoyable and I've watched it many times!
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Like any official Apple product, it works.  It is kind of annoying that Apple changed the magsafe connector on the new laptops.  But the old was was just too fat ;)<br /><br />I bought a few of these so i can use all the Apple power cords I have acquired over the years.<br /><br />The trickiest thing with these is that they are tiny, so make sure you don't lose it!
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|Joshua LOVED this toy that couldn't be found anywhere but on Amazon. Pricey! Compared to retail but worth it for because it was all he wanted!!
B005LAII62|5.0|This movie had me instantly. It was so sweet and had such heart. The story is great and had me crying at the end. I had forgotten about the character controversy until that scene. Which I must admit even took me by surprise, but it was a very minor point to the film as a whole. I think this is a great film for families with children 9 and over. There may be some wariness about death and ghosts, which may require a conversation before viewing the film and definitely after. This movie surprised me about how good it was and I regret not seeing it in a theater. This movie stole my heart like the live action Wizard of Oz and the animated Hunchback of Notre Dame. I will definitely be watching this film for years to come.
B004VD3YIM|3.0|The app works just great on my Kindle Fire HD. I am very pleased with the results. The problem I am having is the bane of the Amazon App Store. UPDATES. The Google Play version of this app is V5.0.4 and has a number of enhancements that I really would like to have. Multiple cams audio, 2-way audio for my setup, H.264 codec and many others. Please update this app so I can enjoy all these new features and this review goes to 5+!<br /><br />StevieJ
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game with excellent graphics! One of the best hunting games I've played in the market. There should be an option to sell old weapons for cash though.
B00EUEWRUI|5.0|This is not the only footage by far... Rockpalast recorded them in July 1985 and the footage is a complete concert, and available, if only through bootleg sites. Exactly the way \\"Black Masquerade\\" appeared legally many years after being a boot for so long. But this footage is from Sydney, apparently, and not the Paris Rockpalast show. I'm buying it, but haven't purchased it yet.

B00ELIKDXG|5.0|This is the second adventure of Alex and Katie in these reworkings of old Russian tales by Julia Gousseva. The story is not only entertaining and beautifully written, but it has the magic and wishes that all children love to hear about, as did my son when I read him this ebook. We were both happy to have spent time in this magical world with Alex and Katie, and are looking forward to another adventure with them.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I first saw this movie on Netflix a couple of months ago and could not stop laughing. Without giving too much away, this is a typical young people go on a road trip in the woods and end up dying. Yeah. It's the way they die that's the twist. Think the car scene in Pulp Fiction. After watching this I immediately wanted to re-watch it because I was laughing at the most ridiculous scenes. My daughter and I have added this to our Halloween movie program we do every year. Trust me, this movie is very entertaining.

157421327X|1.0|Ms. McNeill's series is sold one half chapter at a time. Her entire series should be compiled into one book. This is not a reasonable price for half of a chapter.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|You shouldn't get this app. Since it's free, there are only like two colors and they're yellow and green! There's nothing fun to do and you have to paint EVERY SINGLE FINGER where as in other nail games you just press a button and your design goes on every finger! There are also constant adds popping up when you're trying to play the game! Don't get this app.
B004X75RK4|5.0|It was good clean fun. A very enjoyable film. Ryan Reynolds is sizzly and Sandra Bullock performs beautifully in this romantic comedy!!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started to read it.  Typical Child/Reacher story but always enjoyable with a few different swists.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|I'm a big fan of martial art movie and of course movie where Jet Li is in. This movie is very intense Andre used of arts is splendid. I recommend watching this movie. Also watch the House of the Flying Dagger.<br />Another movie of his is Tai Chi Master (1993) it's an old movie but it doesn't lose it edge when it comes to fighting scene and plot
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a splended book. I would love to read another like with this kind delight. I would rate this at a 10 if i could
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I've been a fan of NIN since the beginnings so it's no surprise that Mr. Reznor manages to make another amazing album to me.
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|If you like Charles Bronson, then you will love this movie. The cast is good and so is the plot.<br />The scenery is beautiful, and the match up of Bronson vs Lee Marvin is awesome.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|Kindle Fire HD - 8.9&#34;<br /><br />Sometimes in the middle of the day a person just needs to take a nap and drown out everything around them. Turn on this app, select your mood (tunes), and relax away. A nice selection of sounds to choose from that loop constantly. You can turn one or ten... your choice. Plus you can actually adjust the volume of each sound in case the bells are too loud or the thunder is too quiet.<br /><br />Aside from wishing there were a few more tunes (types of music) to choose from, the one annoyance is that this app uses only portrait mode. That means when the Kindle is propped up in its case, which is landscape, the app doesn't turn. Not a big deal except when you are trying adjust it on your nightstand as you doze off for a while. Overall a good app to have, even with the ads.<br /><br />Warning: Sounds may appear more realistic than you realize. Fell asleep once with the claiming rain and thunder one time only to wake up a short time later thinking it was pouring rain outside and that I left my car windows down. Took a minute to figure out where the thunder was coming from as I looked out at a clear blue sky when I jumped too my feet to look out the window.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I bought this, being somewhat in shape already, but wanting another workout to use via Amazon Video that was quick and effective.  I've been taking classes at my gym, and am in pretty good shape.  I've done the Ripped in 30 before so I had a realistic expectation.<br /><br />Even though I'm in decent shape, this still delivered a tough 20 minute workout.  I definitely broke a sweat and felt like I'd worked out.  I am totally glad I bought this.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Its not an actual app for google search. but instead you have to go to the Internet for the searches. I thought it would search on the app, buy I thought wrong. ill be looking for another search engine for my kindle fire.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|I love this show is has everything the crews bikes aren't that nice though other then that I love it
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like the charging cable with it's USB plug and, the little charger Adapter that is available as well which gives one to option to charge either with the computer or the AC  receptacle !
0399159347|4.0|I have read all the books by this author, and every one is a different story, well written, with characters that draw you in.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />What is the secret of the husband?  Without giving anything away, its a secret that you are desperate to find out as is the wife, Cecilia.  You might have an inkling prior to the reveal, but even if you do, the story continues along with supporting characters, all soon to be entwined with each other as their lives go on in a leafy suburb of Australia.<br /><br />This is a book that just lends itself to reading in 1-2 sittings.  The writing style means the story flows well and effortlessly, and its just an enjoyable read!  Simple!!<br /><br />I also highly recommend another book by Liane Moriarty \\"What Alice Forgot\\".  That remains my favourite by this author, so if you don't love The Husbands Secret, there are some other great reads by Moriarty.  And unlike some authors who seem to rehash the same storyline every time, this won't be the case with her books!
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|FAOTD - Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;<br /><br />Free Version - Has ads, but nothing too distracting. The board and the controls are straight forward, just like the real game. You have a few different levels to choose from so you don't get bored. The only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars is that the controls seem to lag a bit plus its hard to move (slide) your finger fast enough to block or deflect a shot. On the easier levels its not too big of a deal, however on the Insane level every millisecond counts if you ever want to score. Still a fun game to place once in a while.
0307010856|5.0|I got this book for Christmas when I was 4 years old.  My Aunt, my sister, and my mother read this to me until they were blue in the face.  I Loved this book.  I still do, so I bought it again.  The original copy was eventually thrown away in my late teens when the cover was gone and I realized I could quote the entire book from memory.  This is so much fun to read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love playing this game everyday after school and building my city even more everyday. I love thinking I am the mayor of my little city.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|I was sorely disappointed with this. There was no plot, no reason for almost anything that happened. You have a pretty standard set up and then the script goes no where with it. It is simply gory for gore's sake, which I find unimpressive at best. There is no real character development or depth. It was a waste of my time.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I really don't think kik deserves 1 star cos it used to work just fine until now. I don't know what's wrong with the app. Maybe it's trying to update but they need to fix it, please.
B008JFUR10|1.0|Buy this movie if you're ten years old or have a mentality to match.  It's not worth any more characters.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|FAOTD - Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;<br /><br />The speakers are great the device, and listening to anything with headphone is nice as well. However, no system is complete until there is an EQ installed to really get some depth out of the sound. Whether it is just playing music, or playing a favorite game, this little app enhances the quality of audio many times over. Highly recommend this app (free if you can find it) if you don't have an EQ on your system already.
0316219266|5.0|I just completed reading this informative and enthralling look at the history of Amazon.com.<br />In my opinion, Brad Stone (via this title) has created the *definitive* compilation of information of both Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com.<br /><br />If you have ever read his pieces on Businessweek, you'll know that Stone has an extensive network of former and current Amazon employees to leverage in providing accurate, and exclusive tidbits of information about the company.<br />The Everything Store is a continuation in the same vein as the aforementioned pieces, albeit in much lengthier detail.  (If you are worried that this book acts as a conduit to praise Bezos, please allay your fears as this book shows positive and negative aspects of both Bezos and Amazon.com)<br /><br />The book briefly discusses Bezos' up-bringing, and the idiosyncrasies exhibited by him at that presage his rise to power.  It continues to talk about the formation of the company, and Bezos' initial vision and continues through the history of the company with an emphasis on how Bezos kept control of Amazon.com through a rotating door of investors, employees, and sub-ordinate executives with conflicting ideas.<br /><br />As someone who is very interested in the story of Jeff Bezos (who is considered to be a media recluse) and in the continued success of Amazon.com, The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amzon was a thrilling read that I completed in a single sitting!
B00FK8NHS4|4.0|I started reading Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta mysteries at the beginning of the series and during this process I've gotten to know her characters quite well.  Unfortunately, as this long-running series about medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta neared its midpoint at number ten, I began to dislike all of them.  Rich, beautiful, intelligent, sensitive Dr. Scarpetta kept getting into trouble over and over again because she didn't know how to pick her friends.  I really wanted her to stop functioning as everybody's doormat.  I never did warm up to her genius niece, Lucy and her long-running sexual identity crisis.  The major male characters were all jerks.  FBI profiler, Benton Wesley had as much personality as a block of wood.  Ex-cop, Pete Marino was frankly repulsive.<br /><br />What kept me going was Cornwell's plots and the really fascinating forensic backdrop of this series.  It was an education in forensic pathology to watch Dr. Scarpetta meticulously search for clues in her refrigerator full of corpses, without having to smell the actual smells or see all of the icky stuff that the author so vividly describes.<br /><br />In this 20th entry of the series, Scarpetta is still functioning as the universal doormat, but Benton, who is now her husband unbends enough to call one of the villains a t---ball.  Male chauvinist, Pete Marino falls into a neat plot twist caused by his own boorish proclivities.  Lucy, the world's richest know-it-all looks to be finally settling down with her barn full of planes and helicopters.  There are lots of interesting corpses--older women, this time--and a really vivid underwater scene where Dr. Scarpetta retrieves one of the victims of a serial killer who tangled with a giant turtle well after her death.<br /><br />I still had to plow through lengthy descriptions of designer clothes, designer coffee, designer sunglasses, cars, and helicopters, and there were patches of indigestible dialogue--\\"'There are any number of volatile organic compounds that could render someone unconscious,' my chief toxicologist says.  'Toluene, carbon tetrachloride, one-one-one-trichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, provided you use high enough levels.'\\"--but Dr. Scarpetta's careful decipherment of the language of the dead and the hunt for the serial killer kept me reading \\"The Bone Bed\\" well past my bedtime for a couple of nights running.ounds that could render someone unconscious,' my chief toxicologist says.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|I like how it handles the Kindle Fire, but I don't like that the color wore off right away.  Had I known, I would have been careful to lay my Kindle on the black side.  Now I am disappointed that my Kindle MicroShell looks ugly and dirty, though it is not dirty, the wear makes it appear that way.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My granddaughter and I enjoy playing this game together. She can read now and loves reading everything to me. Great game, thanks
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you follow Steven King books, then this is a must. I always wondered what happened to the young boy Dan Torrance with the great gift of the \\"shining\\". It is a great and fast read, you will be recommending it to all of your friends.
039916409X|5.0|I was skeptical about tapping, but Margaret's encouraging no nonsense approach has changed my life. I have uncovered some hang ups that kept me from my greates potential and released them. The change is dramatic! I highly recommend this book!
B002JXK5VU|4.0|This is a SyFy ( really liked when they were SciFi) goodie. A very interesting concept of a town for America's most Brainac science type nerds. There are always adventures and wierd things happening in this small town. Mostly the plot centers on the science projects and inventions getting lose on the good people of Eureka ( and possibly the world), and the not so Brainac/ non nerd local sheriff solving the case and saving all. I know, not so brillant a plot, but enjoyable and decent FX ( for a non premium channel). Try it, you may like it.
1609611543|4.0|dr. davis' book is definitely an eye-opener for anyone wondering about how \\"good\\" wheat is in any form.  it's not.  i'm neither a doctor nor dietitian, but this seems like a very thoroughly researched topic, that sadly is very depressing.  i'm an obese fella and love good quality breads and such.  I've learned like sugar is sugar in any form, wheat is bad whether white, whole grain, organic and whatnot.  gluten-free is no better.  dr. davis recommends quitting cold turkey, and if you can you're a better person than me.  my complaint is 3/4 of the book is all the problems wheat causes, which are many, but only spends 1/4 of the book with healthy solutions and options.  I would have liked it more 50/50 or so.  if you're going to rip on a food product, you should spend equal time building up a supportive alternative.  since wheat is in about everything in a grocery store, it's not an easy transition to make and more positive information would have been helpful.  but all in all, this is an important book to read.  it will make you look at what you eat and how you shop totally different.  if not, you're a wheat zombie!!!!  highly recommended book.  I see he has a cookbook out too that i'll have to check out.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Good price for the DVD. Cute-Childhood memories!!  My 3year old loves it so life is good!!! this is now a part of our family DVD collection and loving it
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The worst book in the world!it utterly sucked good bye by bye by bye by bye by bye by bye
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Initially I had mixed views about this movie, which was a simple case of over anaylizing things. I kept trying to figure out why more long range weaponry wasn't involved  and why the two mechs that did have them (Gypsy and Striker with the plasma cannon and chest mounted cannons) just ran up to the beasts instead of firing on them at a distance. Well I got to thinking of it more and the reason is simple: If the monsters were safely shot down froma  distance, it simply wouldn't have been much of a movie. There of course would have been problems with this as well, the plot of the movie has them resource drained. They've already spent so much on the Jageurs as it is and they've spent so much on the 'protective wall'..more expensive weaponry would have added additional expenses to their already draining resources. And there I go over anaylzing again..<br /><br />The visuals-as always with Toro, are excellent with his typical ridiculous level of detail that you'll either have to watch multiple times to notice, or watch the special features. An example would be tiny bikes, tv's, etc being used as debris or the pistons moving under the Jageurs' armor plating.<br /><br />I'm not sure what other movie some other reviewers were watching, but the CGI is actually well done and the dark/rainy scenes do not interfere at all. All of it is very clear to what's going on, even in the underwater fight. The monsters (and mechs) do not have that obvious fake look that some other cgi movies have, they seem to move with actual weight  and with a sense of force behind their attacks and the director and his crew were very careful to keep them reasonable realistic, porportioned and scaled consistently.  I did not find anything 'off' with any of the cgi.<br /><br />The acting was decent-good. My only complaint about this is that 'Newton', one of the comic relief scientists, should have been toned down just a bit. The other one was much more believable though. Overall, all of the acting was decent enough to not be worth any complaints other then what I mentioned, so I'm not going to change the rating just for this very minor issue. Others have complained about some of the characters being cliche. I can see how that is, especially with the Russians..but really, it's not a problem considering that they get very little screen time. So again, no issue.<br /><br />So while this movie genre is not typical of Toro's work, I'd say that it is up to his standards and worth atleast a rent. If you like Kaiju films and/or mechs-then it's worth a buy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its ok just for the go but on the computer its much better because on the computer you can do much more on creative mode
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Missed this one when it was on Fox. I am glad I have it on my revolving playlist for videos. Very nice procedural show involving the FBI and of course a plot by an entity for world domination. The twist of course is that this procedural involves some very freaky/fringe science. The cast is good, the good guy &#34;mad&#34; scientist is great in that role. Overall, a very enjoyable show.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is my first review. However I am inspired to write one because this book was so engrossing, well written, and such a beautiful story that I must share my thoughts. Very well done. Please read it.  You won't regret it.
1405911662|1.0|I hated the way it was written.  I read one chapter and quit reading.  Very poor writer!!!  I won't read that author again.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the final book but to.often I had trouble with action versus psychological thought. An examples the peacekeepers are at the door and you decided to drift off and think about Prim. However,the finality was well conceived.

076115678X|5.0|I am growing my hair back in after going through chemo.  I have curls like I did when I was young, before I started coloring my hair and it straightened and thinned.<br />As I am discovering how to care for the curls I bought this book to see if it would help me.<br />I am happy to say that it has many tips and tricks for the newly curly.  I guess if you have had curly hair for a while then  you know that you should not use a towel on your hair as it pulls and ruffled the cuticles.  I did not know I should treat my hair like fragile lace or cashmere.<br />I really liked this book and it is much cheaper than all the wrong products I have tried, mainly the ones with silicones. Who knew?  I have very fine curly wavy hair, it is now a 2C I think, still learning. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging! Ready for more rooms!! Not too difficult but very addictive! My whole family was getting in on the fun!
0765325950|5.0|I was thrilled to read this book. I don't know how anyone could complain about it. I thought the end fitting and I really haven't been filled with emotions like I was with this book in a long time.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I did not like all the Jay Z music...isn't it supposed to be set in the 1920's?? I didn't get it. Why would they have \\"booty dancers\\" and rap music in that time period?? It would of been a great movie without that. Too confusing.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Short story but scary. This is classic Steven King. Liked all the characters and I got the popular culture references.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Steelheart. It bears many of the hallmarks of a YA book, but sets it in a world that could easily be expanded to stories of a more epic proportion. In fact, I hope it is. But well worth the read. It is another brandishing of Sanderson's thrill-centric story telling, plus a few unusual stabs at a new style of humor and a teenager's point-of-view.
0375869026|5.0|Great book!!! I read this to my 9 year old son every night and we loved it.  Wonderful story and lesson about being different.  Loved the way the story was told from different characters.  This is a must read! I already bought this book for three other people and have told many others about it.  Glad I came across this one!!

I can't play ONE video but others wise it worked fine I hope they can fix the bug I really loved this app but I say you should get it if for some reason you cant play video's on your Internet then get it it works really well for a while
B00881VLCE|5.0|UPDATE: 11/29/13<br />The force close issues have been fixed (for the most part).  Once in a while I will experience it, but rarely. Also, haven't lost any progress in a puzzle due to force close issues. I changed my review to 5 stars ...from 1 star. Thankfully, the developers are taking care of their customers. I've purchased more puzzle packs and also removed the ads.<br /><br />Original Post:<br />I have been using this app for a long time. It worked good on my kindle fire and then an update was made in approximately July and then I started having intermittent force close issues. Now another update has been instituted 10/14/13 and I can't use the app at all.  Keeps force closing all the time. Un-installed and called Amazon for a refund! Had enough.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great story and an awesome follow up bout the kid from The Shining, hope there is more to come about Dan Torrance.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Absolutely love these books!!! Their a great read and they have a beautiful story line!!! Has the right mixture of everything: love, mystery, action, secrets, family history's that are tied together, etc! Must read if you haven't :)
039916409X|5.0|I have been following Margaret Lynch's work for the past few years and I find her book very deep and effective.

B00DOPEGAS|5.0|Handmade, wearable art is an enduring and endearing fashion expression of school-aged youth. From headbands and string bracelets to duct-tape bags and knotted scarves and hats, all manner of original designs and functionality sweep through the schoolyard year to year.<br /><br />This season, the big thing is the \\"crazy loom,\\" a pegged board on which small bands can be attached to create a variety of colorful rubber-linked bracelets and necklaces. Give into this craze and purchase this item for your child or family. Not only will they learn to follow pretty intense directions, they are rewarded for doing so with an intricate and beautiful design. The loom builds a positive feedback loop into their efforts as they share experiences and product samples with their family and peers (right now, I'm wearing two of the dozen or so bands my kids made me).<br /><br />You know a craft is something special when both 3rd-grade boys and 5th-grade girls are coming together on the playground to swap ideas, compare styles and trade bands. The loom opens up this kind of cross-age and gender participation and skills building. If only art class provided this kind of artistic and colloborative fun.<br /><br />Peer acceptance and social groups are important influences even at the elementary level. Encourage your child's positive growth and development of this kind of \\"social learning\\" through this unique and affordable fad.

140006922X|5.0|I've read a good deal about the period addressed by Reza Aslan in his book which, at this writing, is still ranked high in the NY Times bestseller list.  He obviously did an enormous amount of research on the origins of Christianity, reflected in his extensive notes on each chapter.  Despite the Fox News interview questioning Aslan about how a Muslim could write a book about Jesus, the book itself is pure history, the author clearly without an axe to grind.  Doesn't even mention Islam or the mention of Jesus as a prophet in the Qur'an.  I found of special interest in the book, the description of the critical role of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in the year 70 in determining the future of what would become the Roman Catholic church.  The book clearly identifies James, the brother of Jesus,  as the true leader of the followers of Jesus after the crucifixion.  The rival movement led by Paul--who never met Jesus and experienced him only in his vision on the road to Damascus and by intuiting his spiritual messages--was the version of Christianity that survived and was adopted by Constantine as the principal religion of the empire.  The original followers of Jesus, all of whom remained Jews, became the losers when Titus's army leveled Jerusalem in the year 70.  And of course the winners are the ones who write the history books.  This history by Aslan sort of sets the record straight
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I could not put this book down. Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is a pleasure to dive into. The subject matter is fascinating , loved the story. Another home run for Elizabeth Gilbert.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I had no idea what was coming as I read this book. That doesn't happen very often<br />and I appreciate when an author can surprise. I bought the next installment as soon as I finished this first book.<br />Read this book first. I'm liking this author and the series.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Horrible horrible horrible audio quality on this blu Ray disc, heard it was officially recalled by the label/studio. I returned it for a full refund. I'm hoping they correct the matter and reissue the disc so I can repurchase it the way Madonna edited it to be seen.

B00DSY8D36|1.0|I downloaded this app for my MacBook Pro on 10/13/13.  It has failed to work on my MacBook.  I have tweeted my issue.  In addition, I have emailed support.  I sent an email with the PDF files that I was trying to open.  I also included a video showing the app is not working properly.  It has been 3 days.  This is beyond frustrating that I cannot get the proper support to resolve the issue.  I contacted AppleCare, and they stated everything is working properly on my Mac.  I cannot believe that I cannot receive assistance with an app that I purchased.  This is ridiculous.  I purchased and downloaded another app that is very similar to this one and it works perfectly.  More importantly, I have left a review of this application giving it another terrible rating.  The likelihood of this app succeeding after my App Store review, tweets, and Facebook comments posts is very slim.  Clearly, customer reviews are very important to consumers.  I am beyond disappointed in how the support department has ignored my issue.  Furthermore, I have requested a refund for this app.  This is the worst experience that I have had with an application.  I have hundreds of applications on my Mac, iPad, and iPhone and all of them function as stated except for the one from your company.  Each time this app crashes a crash report is sent to Apple.  Does your company receive a copy of this report?  I am going to guess that you do receive a copy of this report.  Apple is a very innovative company in the number 1 brand in the world.  I can't imagine why you haven't reviewed the crash report.  However,  I was advised by AppleCare that I can callback with my case number and they will begin a process to investigate my complaint in detail.  I will be contacting them today!<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Toya Hayden

0131480057|4.0|This book is amazing. I maintain a server that sees a lot of traffic, and can only afford to have a VPS. This book has shown me how to deploy a server on Linux, in a CPU friendly, and secure manner. This is not a book to simply teach you the ins and outs of being a sysadmin, but is an amazing reference for those of us who have enough experience to understand what we need to get done just aren't sure of the best way to do it. You might end up going from cover to cover (which wouldn't be a bad thing as this book contains a wealth of knowledge) but instead you will use it as the need arises. I keep it next to my desk just to be safe.

B004JMY312|5.0|Our 6 year old loved it.  No nightmares to worry about!  :)  We will watch this again and again!  :)
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I so am hooked on this show!  The characters draw you into their world.  The story lines are always building on each other leaving you wanting to know what is going to happen next.  Both seasons are a must  watch!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very good construction and packaging. Very good interface.<br />Limited (at least for now) to youtube, netflix and google movies. Hoping the functionality will be extended in the future.<br />Much better than the rikomagic stick I had before it.
B00EK3EFEA|4.0|As a massive fan of Bible Belt and The Velveteen Age EP, I was looking forward to this release. More-so than many other album releases of the year. I am not disappointed in the least bit. Diane teased fans with youtube and twitter samples of some of the released songs so I'm not a stranger to a handful of tracks, but I am ecstatic to have them on CD finally.<br /><br />The sound is MUCH different when compared to her previous releases due to the life experiences she has undergone since the release of her first album. It's sort of an ethereal, 80s midtempo, soul/pop clash. Works beautifully for showcasing her voice as well as her natural melody-forging talent. Within one listen there are numerous parts of this album that I was caught up on and couldn't stop humming.<br /><br />That being said, the one-star deduction for me comes from a slight lack of variety. When listened to in segments the album is brilliance! However as an entire album the tracks begin to blend into an almost continuous song with separate movements and segments. This is most likely due to the midtempo nature of the entire album. Nonetheless it isn't a major problem.  The sound engineering (although I'm sure it's intentional) sounds muffled and a bit demo-like in places. This is a personal preference. Works wonderfully for some songs but for others it can be distracting.<br /><br />Don't even get the standard edition. PURCHASE THE DELUXE EDITION to get the full album experience. I don't know why Adelaide didn't make the standard cut or Hold On A Little Longer. Both are perfect examples of Diane Birch in her element.<br /><br />Lighthouse will be the crowd pleaser, with an Adele-like melody and sound.<br />Unfkd is one of the most poignant and moving songs she's ever released.<br />It Plays On, is (from my interpretation), written about her recent breakup. Listen for the emotion.<br /><br />Highly recommend the (deluxe edition) album.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch story, just excellent.  I look forward with anticipation for each new Michael Connelly Harry Bosch or Lincoln Lawyer book.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|Yes , there are the common songs one is familiar with but then there are a lot more I have never heard anywhere else which are even better IMO than the best known ones. For example Lovers Live a Little Longer is superb and has some unusual lyrics! Ha! Kisses of Fire absolutely thrilling. Amazing to find these lesser known songs that are easily as good as Dancing Queen or almost as good as One Of US. If you are an ABBA fan and you don't have this, shame on you! Ha!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's the real thing for ios and other devices! Not like them countless fake copies people have been getting. It's not the same as Xbox 360 version or the PC version but still pretty decent but slowish on update. Which is undetectable seeing how there is about 4 or 5 people on the PE staff. Never the less she's getting better and I expect to see her suppress her only competitor survival craft which has more to offer for less but it pretty buggy imo.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I and probably most people bought this with the dream of watching locally stored video on my TV.  My PC and Laptop are in other rooms from where my TV sits.  I'm not moving my laptop to be near the TV whenever I want to watch a stored video.  There's no room for a laptop except for the floor and with a 7 year old child and a dog running around the house, that is not going to happen.  The Chromecast would solve this problem.  But Google is being a butt-head about letting developers release there apps.  This device was released on July 24, 2013.  Today is 16 October and still NOTHING.  When an enterprising individual came up with his own app to play locally stored video, Google killed it with an update to the Chromecast.  For Google wanting to be more open with this device, it takes a backseat to it's precious partners who have yet to get off the stick.  Third party developer's have Apps waiting in the wings and Google is the roadblock.  As for the FEW available apps, they do work great.<br /><br />So, my advice is DO NOT BUY until Google is ready to let the ball roll.  Keep checking back here for newer reviews that will then sing this thing praises.  Then you'll know it's time to buy.  For now, my $35 is wasted.  I haven't used in in almost 2 months.  It'll sit there for now.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Fantastic movie!!!  Terrific plot with lots of action.  Everyone should take the time to see it.  Hope there are more.

B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This game was really interesting. The storyline was one of the best of all games I have played. The mini games are a workout for the brain but not overly difficult. The game was long enough that it was definitely worth the price I paid for it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Definitely would recommend to everyone. Engaging writing and kept me on my toes. Can't wait to watch the movie coming out soon.
B003UPPO2G|1.0|I purchased this to download into my I-pod, and also enjoy on my computer in my I-tunes collection.  OK, so I did not open it for a couple of months.....very busy summer.  Can you imagine my surprize when I discovered this is not a CD, but a DVD.  Yes, I can watch it on my DVD player, but am so disappointed it cannot be downloaded into my I-pod.  Buyer beware, as it is now well past the date I would have been able to return it.  Live and learn I guess.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|You'll absolutely love this version of the endearing Emma, presented in the best way, retaining the witticisms, romance and surprises, true to the book yet well developed. Highly recommend.

B00FPH51LQ|5.0|RIPD is a very entertaining movie. The plot is fresh and new.  Ryan Reynolds is a police officer who is shot by his partner, Kevin Bacon over some gold.  Next, we see Ryan being pulled upwards into the sky and continuing on through a tunnel that opens within the clouds.  As he's spinning around in this tunnel within the clouds, he sees other dead people all around him also being pulled upwards through this tunnel. The tunnel pops him out and into the office of Mary Louise Parker. She gives Ryan a choice of either going to face judgment or joining RIPD Boston. She says the tour is 100 years, after which he'll face judgment but with a good recommendation.  Ryan accepts and is introduced to his partner, Jeff Bridges.  Jeff's character is a law man from the 1800's who was also shot dead by his partner.  The two go after a \\"dead-o\\" and stumble onto a plot to reverse the tunnel that takes the dead up to judgment.  If the plot is successful, it would cause all the dead people to rain down and pollute the earth.<br /><br />A reviewer said he thought RIPD was too similar to the Men in Black series.  I disagree. In the Men in Black movies, the partners are people who are alive and are enlisted in an organization to capture aliens. In RIPD, the partners are people who are dead and are trying to capture dead people who have escaped judgment. Also, the plot in RIPD is about Ryan and Jeff stopping this tunnel from being reversed.  So I don't think RIPD is similar to Men in Black at all.  The plot is fresh, new and very entertaining.<br /><br />Also, I thought Jeff Bridges was extremely funny.  Ryan Reynolds did a good job and fit the character he was playing.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Very nice CD. Always amazing to think what could have been if this song writer had gotten the attention he deserved back in the 60's and 70's.. Shipped quickly and was received in good condition.

B001MSMULG|4.0|A good read, character development was excellent.  We can understand the personal torture Gabriel is enduring at the losses he has faced because of the career he has chosen in The Office.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a great CD. It arrived quickly but there seems to be a slight skip thru out the CD. Other than that, its a beautiful CD. So glad I purchased it

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Everyone checked the ego's at the door. They did an amazing job re-creating Georges' songs. You couldn't have asked for anything more.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I recently returned from London England where I finally got to see and hear the play \\"The Jersey boys\\" produced by the genius Bob Gaudio.  The \\"sound\\" that made the Four Seasons famous a lifetime ago was rekindled for my longing to hear it again.  So when I returned I looked for my albums in vain and bought this \\"The Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons\\" to compare with the original Broadway Recording I purchased at the Prince Edward theater in London.<br />It is beyond me how Gaudio/Valli Productions found this talent and created an outstanding musical show.  I was totally entranced with the music and lyrics that were ignited from the shelter of the corners of my mind. The people next to me in the theater were astonished that I sang all the songs with the cast.  Surprisingly, I was also impressed I knew these songs backwards and forwards.<br />Comparing the album to the cast recording: the former is a pieced together album from recordings at different times over thirty years. Not all are at the same volume and have to be adjusted slightly.  However, compared to the quality of the latter, it is excellent.  Compared to my recordings I produced for my convertible by copying my 45s on my Norelco cassette recorder in the late 60s, they are outstanding.<br />Speaking of such, this album brings me right back to cruising the lake in my 62 red with white rag-top Chevy Impala with the top down. Although much of those memories are washed and suppressed by the trauma of being drafted for the Viet Nam War, these images come back with this music.  While many were going ape over the British imports, many of us identified with the blue collar sound of these Italian American Northerners.  We have never left them----God Bless Bob Gaudio, Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons.
039916409X|5.0|Margaret Lynch is a fabulous teacher and author. Her books and tapes have revealed and help me overcome numerous obstacles in my journey to increase my income. I would recommend Margaret's teachings to everyone who is really interested in getting to the root causes that are keeping them from increasing their wealth and income.

159448385X|5.0|I love the author of this book &#34;Khaled Hosseini&#34;. His writing is so detailed and enlightening. To learn of the forced traditions and living conditions of the afghan people during their civil war has shown me a new insight on the people and children and there suppressed and impoverished lifestyles.There are so many homeless children and orphaned children.

B0083VP2KQ|5.0|Planet Dinosaur by the BBC is a fascinating look at Earth during the time of the dinosaurs.  It uses sparkling and spectacular graphics to depict the predator -  prey relationship between the various types of dinosaurs, and makes you feel as though you have a ringside seat to these epic conflicts.  The series showcases many different types of dinosaurs, including ferocious carnivores, docile herbivores, and a mixture of in-between creatures.  What I found so interesting about this series is the variety of unusual dinosaurs that I had never even heard of!  This is no depiction of the typical Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Velociraptor - rather, it shows creatures that heretofore have only been known to researchers and paleontologists.<br /><br />The graphic depictions are interspersed with scientific analyses, showing bones and other fossil records and where they were found.  The series does a nice job of contrasting the different time periods and the different creatures who inhabited those time periods.  When you realize the overwhelming variety of dinosaurs that have existed, and how much we actually know about them, you will be astonished.<br /><br />The series is divided into 6 smaller segments, each about 30 minutes.  The narration by John Hurt is perfect - understated but just enough to keep you focused on what you are seeing.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this series to any dinosaur fanatics out there - you will not be sorry!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it. Couldn't put it down. These are my kids books and I'm completely obsessed. I am buying the next book immediately.
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />There's no denying that Shakespeare's influence is slowly fading year after year. For most, his work is simply too difficult to comprehend when majority of readers read for pleasure. However, there are others, like Joss Whedon, who continuously try to keep the legendary poet relevant. I'll admit, before sitting down to watch Much Ado About Nothing, I was unfamiliar with the play. You see, I too find Shakespeare's writing a chore to get through, but I still find myself constantly drawn to his work. His stories always manage to be both grand and unbelievably simple at the same time, which is probably why I have this irrefutable attraction to his plays.<br /><br />As one would guess, Much Ado About Nothing is very similar in that regard. Taking place in Messina, Sicily, the story follows a group of individuals who are surrounded by love, lies, and deception. Claudio (Fran Kranz) and Hero (Jillian Morgese) may seem like the main couple in the beginning, but as the story progresses, a greater emphasis is put on Benedick (Alexis Denisof) and Beatrice (Amy Acker). Now, as with any Shakespeare story, there are a lot of characters and most, if not all, are important in their own, individual way. Also, there are multiple stories that intertwine to form a much larger narrative. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of absent information which leaves a lot of room for confusion.<br /><br />Therein lies my biggest complaint: Much Ado About Nothing seems tailored to the familiar. Those uninitiated are left to fend for themselves in hopes of gaining the slightest understanding of the story being told. The plot is always advancing, but the viewer is left without any back-story or explanation as to why these things are happening. As if adjusting to the Shakespearean language wasn't difficult enough, I now had to put together the pieces of a puzzle with just a few lines here and there of what \\"might\\" have happened. Most ofmy understanding came from assumption and it wasn't until I researched after-the-fact that I actually grasped the story in its entirety.<br /><br />With that said, though, it's hard for me to be too negative because it's just so damn enjoyable. Maybe it's the fact that it was filmed in black and white or maybe it's because of its overwhelming simplicity, but it's such a joy to watch. Even when I only had a minimal understanding of what was going on, I was having the time of my life. The characters, the world they inhabit, and the story that surrounds them is so grounded that you would think you were taking a peak over a neighbor's wall watching these events unfold.<br /><br />It should be noted, though, that I wasn't a fan of Whedon's choice to modernize the setting. The language, mannerisms, and cultural traditions present in the story didn't always mesh well in this modern, suburban area. Another thing I noticed was that these modernizations weren't always consistent. For example, in what I can only assume was a police station, they had these ancient looking surveillance monitors, but they had nice, flat screen computer monitors. Then the interrogation \\"room\\" wasn't closed off by any walls or two-way mirrors. It was just open space for anyone and everyone to see and hear what was going on. An argument could be made that the setting is a few decades old, but there were two or three iPhone sightings so that couldn't be true. It was really odd.<br /><br />Finally, as a whole I felt the casting was solid. There's a pretty lengthy cast -- and more than a few familiar faces -- so I won't break them down one by one. I will say, though, that they were all consistently good. However, at times, I found that the delivery of their lines sounded a bit sarcastic. Almost to the point where it sounded like they were mocking the source material. Also, there were a handful of instances where a scene felt very... fabricated. Most of these were found in the more emotional sections of the story, so it doesn't wind up bringing the film down too much, but it did break the engagement that was built up from previous scenes.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.2/10 - While it may have its faults, Much Ado About Nothing is truly a wonderful film. Not only does it tell an engaging story, but it does so in a way that really sticks with you. While I can't comment on how well it relates to the original play, I can say that is a blast to watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in Shakespeare.
0385350864|3.0|I knew the book had gotten bad reviews when I bought it, but I still had to read it and discover first-hand what had happened to Bridget since we last heard from her. While the criticism isn't entirely undeserved (yes, it's too long, Fielding recycles a lot of old jokes, and the new jokes/pratfalls don't always work), there's a lot to recommend this book. Fielding's writing is still delightful, there are some genius observations and turns of phrase that made me laugh out loud, and there were several parts that moved me to to tears.
1476727651|5.0|Great follow up to a great story and a very fast read. I liked finding out how Danny turned out and was glad the book had a good ending.
1250038820|5.0|Joys and sorrows, laughter and tears, beauty and ugliness are all found by Brandon Stanton on the streets of New York.  The title says it all, Humans on display as they are displaying themselves.  Buy this book!  It will renew your faith in humanity,
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing . It is so addicting and I love the minions and despicable me 1 and 2. The only bad thing is the lag. But honestly I believe it's my internet or WiFi connection. Anyway, LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Multiple combinations allow you to find just the right sounds to lull you off to sleep. Not everyone will like them all but the sounds are pretty true to what they are named. Great app
B0091REZMW|4.0|Not bad for a free app...especially if you can be patient and don't buy extra energy, etc. Check it out!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love playing the game and my Great Grand Daughter; who is only 18months old; loves playing it with me. She knows all the names of the fish. We have a great time.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Now THIS is how one writes a political/terrorist thriller. I can only hope that ALL the other authors in this genre take note and take lessons from THE MASTER of suspense and action and informative storytelling. I LOVED learning all about the use of drones in the war on terror. It's fantastic how Forsyth weaves all that knowledge into his story. EVERYTHING and every word from this author furthers the story. And guess what? He didn't have to use SEX to sell his bestseller. Forsyth is simply the BEST at what he does...writing fantastic stories that you don't want to put down! Mr Forsyth, may you live long and give us many more books to enjoy!
B004ODLUGM|4.0|I really  liked how the producer took such a great story book and made it into an adorable movie. Love the squirrel Mom telling the story to her kids. The rhyming words from the story fit perfectly with the artistic interpolation of the story. Really well done!!

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Price is right and its tiny, then you find out it needs to plug into the wall with its own power source. Wasn't willing to run a extension cord through the wall just for this little guy. kind defeats the compact size of the design. disappointing.
B00003CX95|5.0|Why do the Scotts dislike the English, even today...watch this film!  It gives life to a part of history that is often passed over.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|So I've seen some of my colleagues rave about DevOps and praising this book. Decided to read it after spending more than 11 years in Corporate IT, while last years in Operations. This is really refreshing for me but should be a mandatory read for all kids starting working in IT and all the middle to upper management where they believe IT is a forsaken function, just 'supporting' the business. Personally I like also this book taking stab on mentoring and value of trusted person that can help you (if you are willing and smart to follow advice).
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I had to read this book in stages, taking breaks to think. Are we moving in the direction of &#34;transparency&#34; that is a central theme of this book?  I couldn't help but compare the events of the book to the explosion of social networking sites where people post such personal information that not so many years ago was kept private. I'm as guilty as the millions of others devoted to recording the minutia of daily life.  We need to stop ..... Write letters and make phone calls. This book really scared me -- much like &#34;1984&#34; proved to come to be true well before 1984 arrived. It's well worth your time to read. Frightening!
B002RXVOX0|5.0|One of the best Dracula movies I've seen. Frank Langella makes the perfect Dracula. If you want a funny version, try Love at First Bite starring George Hamilton.
B0026ISUUQ|1.0|From the hindsight of 2013 it's evident that this movie is, as others have stated, unwatchable, both because of the technical issues (poor sound engineering, over-bright colors, hand-held camera, staccato-image effect, etc.) and the simplistic predictable plot.  Quality acting can't begin to overcome those deficiencies.  I gave up after 30 minutes.
1250038820|5.0|Buy a copy or two...YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !<br />This is the first book I have bought in years and I love it.  I have been a follower of HONY from the start and fell in love with Brandon and his photography.  This is the true meaning of storytelling.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|It wasn't worth going to see it in the theaters (glad I didnt), nor the $4.99 for 24 hr view. The background music set the stage so you knew what was coming. The acting was very bad for Will Smith Sr., but Jr's accent was pretty good and his acting was okay. The plot was good they could have made more obstacles in the way for the trip that Jr. had to take across the terrain. Overall seemed like a low budget film with unseasoned actors.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Wish I had not ore ordered. Will NEVER preorder a book again. Helen Fielding, in some misguided attempt at being clever, you have killed off the one character in these novels who is like able. So disappointing.
B003FC1752|1.0|After watching the original Poseidon Adventure I rolled this into my queue mainly out of curiosity of how Hollywood would goose the effects and story telling.<br /><br />Poseidon goes belly up in all ways - characters (vapid - you could care less about anyone), story (tension less), and EFX are phoned in. How can you blow the lead in of the oncoming wave? Ask Wolfgang Petersen who's obviously in it for a massive payday.

140006922X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was raised in a traditional Catholic religion, forced fed a biased bunch of gobbly goop.  This book helped bring me back to a  more realistic, comfortable spiritual reality.
1451627297|4.0|To be fair, if you read the negative reviews of this book (the one stars), they are pretty much dead on.  There are 300 pages in the middle of this book that couldve been condensed quite a bit. I think you can say that about many of King's books.  I read the first 300 pages in a day, dragged a little on the next 300, and couldnt wait to read the last 200.  It had just enough of that other-worldly scenario, alternate universe timeline sci fi stuff, mixed in with actual events from real history.  Some people may not have liked the ending but I thought it was great.  Again, Ive read lots of Kings books and I definitely enjoyed this one.  Just remember, I warned you about the middle of the book.

B00DW1WR14|5.0|Pearl Jam is on a winning streak right now. After 2009's brilliant Backspacer, I had trouble believing they could match its quality again. Boy, was I wrong. Maybe it's basic, and maybe it isn't very cool, but who cares? PJ is becoming Dinosaur Jr: they make records that are familiar and comfortable, but they also always bring their A-game when it comes to songwriting. This album feels youthful and energized like few other albums by artists this old. Brilliant.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|The people who design these sets are to be commended.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Assembling Legos is so good for brain development.
B004A2V3K0|4.0|Loooovvvvveeeee it. I have always been a fan of Bon Jovi, I will always be a fan. I absolutely love his music. He is one of the best from back in the day.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|To say that I enjoyed this book is an understatement.  I have yet to not enjoy something by Mr. Gaiman.  Expertly written and edited so really no need to say more than error rate was zero across the board.  Now on to the story...<br /><br />This is the story of a man who takes a trip back to his childhood home and tells the tale of when he was seven and became friends with a girl named Lettie Hempstock, who lives on the farm at the end of the lane with her mother and grandmother.  In the back of their farm is a pond that Lettie insists on calling \\"her ocean\\".  The name of the main character is never given and the whole book is written in first person point of view.<br /><br />The story in and of itself is very simple, but as with all Gaiman stories there's more to it than meets the eye.  What starts as a normal story quickly evolves into a tale with magic, whimsy and chock full of mythological references.  The Hempstock family is indicative of the triple Goddess imagery of Maid, Mother and Crone, the ocean is shown close to the end of the novel as the life giving waters from many religions, and the hunger birds harken to the mythologies of ravens and crows being evil, eaters of dead and carriers of souls to Hell.<br /><br />But don't let that scare you, as the story is an easy read.  In the epilogue Mr. Gaiman states it started as a short story and there's part of me that feels it might have done better staying that way.  There isn't as much character development as is normally expected with a Gaiman novel and there are bits and pieces that are left unresolved by the end of the book, and I can't help but hope that's setting it up for further stories in this world.  Throughout the entire story there's a feeling to it that is quite reminiscent of when I read Stardust for the first time.  And in thinking about it there are some similarities between the two, two separate \\"lands\\" being so close to each other, interaction between people of either \\"world\\" forever alteringeach others lives.<br /><br />Now don't go in to this expecting something more epic, such as Neverwhere or even American Gods.  It simply isn't that kind of story.  It's a nice \\"rainy evening, curling up with a book and cup of tea\\" type story, though it does have great potential for being more in depth and grand in areas.  Exploring the characters more, providing more character development, which is actually addressed in the novel by the main character.  All in all though a delightful read from a brilliant author.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|For the first time I'm disappointed with a product from Google/Amazon.<br /><br />This thing is a joke.  The synch of audio and video is horrid.  I know, I know, I did all that.  No joy.<br /><br />Google's suggestion is to move my wifi router closer to the TV.  NOT POSSIBLE.  If 3 feet isn't close enough then it's not possible to move it closer.<br /><br />I went back to my ATV3.  At least it synchs.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What I like in Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player, that you don't only stream movies and showes from Netflix, Youtub etc. but you transform your computer or laptop screen to a big TV screen. Installation is very easy (if I can install it, everybody can do it). No wiers or connection cables between the tv and the computer. You can evan use your phone. Good quality of streamed pictures, with very short delay of streaming between the computer and the tv screen, In general... I love it.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So glad I ordered this on the day it was first available directly from Amazon to import to UK shores. I got such a good deal considering the price hike now. I paid $54 which included everything from delivery to import fees and the delivery came within 5 working days from placing the order. Very impressed with the speed of delivery!<br /><br />The item itself. Definitely worth the price. Picture quality for netflix and google play movies is top notch. Streaming videos through laptops chrome browser is a bit patchy but I'm sure it will improve with updates.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this gadget!

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This is really an easy watch Tom Cruise movie, plot's not real deep and the action is good but not your typical non stop action. The science is believable and the plot twists are pretty good - it leaves you smiling! The cinematography (can't believe I used that word) is outstanding, very visually pleasing and it also has a great sound track as well - sample it here on Amazon.  No blood or gore, not scary or thrilling, just a good down to &#34;earth&#34; sci fi movie, that you can watch a couple times.

B0041T52S6|3.0|In the aftermath of Napoleon Dynamite there have been a number of other films in te same league. This film is one of them, but it just didn't do it for me. I found the gaming reality merger thing tedious after a while. I always enjoy watching Mary Elizabeth Winstead act...she was especially good in The Thing, but here she has to do her best with what I feel is weak material. I don't dislike the film and I can understand why some people love it. It doesn't work for me though. Also the dude plays bass in about the worst punk band ever.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Ugh. I thought the cheese would never stop dripping. Very disappointing movie for all the hype it got. The acting was some of the worst I've seen in a long time for a big box office production and the cheese factor was shocking. I want my money back for sure on this one.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Only two things made this less than a perfect movie: casting Natalie Portman as a supposedly brilliant physicist and the love interest (I've always found her to be stiff and overhyped), and the quality of the streaming copy through Amazon, which came through pixellated and choppy during the most explosive scenes.<br /><br />Other than that, the movie shines, as one would expect from Marvel. The storyline is strong, character evolution convincing, and of course the battle scenes and special effects were superb. I wish they'd given Sif a bigger role, but hopefully that'll come in the sequels.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|I have been waiting to read this book for quite some time as it sat in the center of a slowly diminishing pile of books.  Finally approaching this, a work by the man whose library I have read all but the one book he is so known for, I was satisfied and satiated as the mists of Ireland wafted off of the page and chilled my bones as similarly as the fog did to my ancestors only two generations ago.<br /><br />McCourt does some amazing things in this autobiography, mixing his broguish memoir with the muddy taste of poverty, death, and alcoholism.  We follow McCourt in his unparalleled voice as he takes us down the streets of his Ireland, brushing against fate, God, and the horror of the perfect circumstances that lead to tragedy after tragedy that scraped this poor family down the cobble bricks and through the dirt.  The beauty of the memoir resides in the way McCourt writes, and his words demand to be leaned in and listened to in a hushed corner of a pub or library.  Gorgeous in execution, tragedy, and scope, this book is a marvel that it so accurately captures the Ireland that our ancestors have told us about, reminisced over, and whose ghosts still haunt them.<br /><br />Much of the criticism of this novel lies within this - that it exists as an almost stereotypical view of the Irish experience, and brandishes this stereotype as a weapon, the hilt made of an unbalanced truth.  I disagree with this criticism, as it is McCourt writing a true-to-life account, to the best of his recollection, of his battle with the real terror that seemingly creeps around every corner in this text: poverty.  I can also attest to not agreeing with all of the praise - such as several reviews I have seen comparing him to Joyce.  This is also not true, for as much as I love McCourt and his work, he is plainly not James Joyce just because he came from Ireland.  Actually, he is nowhere close to Joyce, and I do not mean this as an insult, but merely the fact that as a memoirist who is documenting his youth, he is not a postmodern writer like the author of Finnegan's Wake and Portrait of the Artist.  He is just as much of an Irishman, though, and the pages are just as soaked with the art, culture, and brogue of the people.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and I will begin to recommend it to as many people as have recommended it to me.  It is beautiful, sad, and tragic, and makes for a document of a time that will never again exist in this form - but should be a warning of the dangers and horror of poverty, manic depression, and alcoholism everywhere.  Until then, well, `Tis.ing his youth, he is not a postmodern writer like the author of Finnegan's Wake and Portrait of the Artist.

B00DF92E7U|4.0|Stephen Stills is the star of this album. His vocal quality has suffered the past few years, but the gruffness of his voice works very well as a blues singer. He's probably become the guitarist that he's worked on developing since his CSNY days and there are some great solos here. Yes, the other two members of The Rides--Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Barry Goldberg--make the songs shine, but the spotlight is on Stills, especially on the songs where he sings lead. My favorite on the disc is &#34;Roadhouse,&#34; the first track. It establishes well what the listener is going to hear.

B007PFD90G|3.0|This book was a lot longer than it needed to be, and is nothing like Rushdie's other works.  There, I said it.  Now that that is out of the way, what I thought about it and why.<br /><br />The text surrounds the decades of his target of the fatwa on his head by the leader of Iran after the publication of The Satanic Verses.  The book is an incredibly long account of the day to day operations of his existence, hiding, transportation, and minutiae that came with the awful hair trigger pointed at his heart.  It focuses on his trials and tribulations as a writer, diplomat, father, husband, and all other considerations as he lived under this oppressive sentence from a stranger in a strange land.  People died as a result of his words.  It is horrific and tragic.<br /><br />This book was a cat crushing beast, and was likely that way as a result of his cataloguing of his day to day habits and anxieties - which most of the time were not entirely interesting to me.  That said, the book is a perfect representation of the life he lived.  A lot for nothing, a fear of words, the weight of the oppression.  In essence the book is a symbolic representation of the life he lived - an oppressive gigantic cumbersome weight, just for words and nothing else.  This part I rather liked, and learning about what he did for so long in such silence was illuminating, and a man such as myself would have lived through it much differently.<br /><br />I liked the main theme of the text:  Free Speech.  Period.  There is nothing that he did a better job communicating throughout the text than this, and there is nothing more sacred in the world and to humanity than the liberty to say whatever one needs to say.<br /><br />That said, I did not like the length at the same rate, even though I understand in many ways it was necessary.  I also did not like the fact that he wrote it in the third person - which may indicate a level of objectivity, however in terms of overall execution, the book contained a great deal of personal observations and opinions about the major players and characters in the text, so while it indicates objectivity, the book had some strong opinions on people - and that actually made me not very impressed with Rushdie in this instance.<br /><br />The book was good, although it could have been shorter with many unnecessary anecdotes taken out, or at least pared down to a more appropriate length for the type.  The work could have either presented itself as objective or subjective, but I was turned off when it did both.  As a document that promoted free speech and is a historical rendering of the author's side of an incredibly important cultural milestone of the 20th century, however, it is impressive.  I could not be more proud of Rushdie and his determination, resolve, and strength with such an important value that is not only his bread and butter, but also humanity's most precious value.t deal of personal observations and opinions about the major players and characters in the text, so while it indicates objectivity, the book had some strong opinions on people - and that actually made me not very impressed with Rushdie in this instance.<br /><br />The book was good, although it could have been shorter with many unnecessary anecdotes taken out, or at least pared down to a more appropriate length for the type.

B00D2PIUAM|5.0|The fact that Placebo is one of those bands that not only sticks around through the test of time; but they also get better with time.  Each new album they have is better written and better orchestrated to show the emotions of the lyrics through all their beautiful sounds that they create.  LLL is no difference.  Battle For The Sun kicked you in the teeth right off the bat and LLL does that, too.  This CD will get you fired up with some hard hitting songs.  It will get you reflecting on things with some of the more somber songs, like Too Many Friends.  This album has a song for every mood and like Placebo themselves, can be enjoyed by anyone from all over the world.  This CD is just fantastic and I'm so happy to have found a copy in America (Barnes and Noble).  I didn't wanna order it online as I didn't want to wait!

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Ocean at the End of the Lane is a minimalist book that accomplishes more than most fantasy novels do in a significantly short amount of time.  It is beautiful, stunning, and quiet, and Gaiman approaches some incredibly intimate elements of his past while dancing with the fantasy genre he is so commonly known for.  It is sweet.  It is humble.  It is terrifying and vindicating.  It is simple.  So simple that when the fantasy portion of the text came to light, and dominated some of the scenes, I was unsure of the impact on the sweetness and cordiality of the text - and felt just as fearful and bewildered as our narrator.<br /><br />Of course, where I get a little unsure of the work is in its execution of where the reality of his situation blurs into the fiction.  It is clear through his interviews and his wife's commentary on the text that it is somewhat autobiographical, but where?  Where does the magic meet reality - or better - where do the borders of the melancholy realities and the isolated life of the narrator seemingly blend in with the magical realism of the events that transpire between these sad and lonely vignettes?<br /><br />It was a beautiful little volume, and it is certainly a window into the life of being a man and an artist that I can certainly relate to.  Gorgeous, simple, and true, this book is a tiny little dive into the ocean at the end of the lane, and a mirror into the mind and souls of the creative, introspective, and artistic adult male.  If only it were really that simple.

B00DW1WR14|5.0|When my mail came the Saturday before this came out, I forgot that I had ordered this album back in the middle of summer.  That made my day right there! Owning this wasn't enough because I was really worried that this album would fall apart.  So many bands don't last as long as PJ has and so few of the ones that do last can continue not only making quality music, but making albums that tops each other.  Backspacer was by far one of the best PJ albums musically and lyrically.  Hearing the two singles from this, Mind Your Manners and Sirens, I knew that this album would have a feeling like you're riding on a wave.  Some songs are up and some are down.  Putting the album in, we are reminded that Eddie Vedder is one of the best singers of all time.  The things he does to his voice to squeeze new emotions out of the songs on this album are awesome.  You have songs like Infallible and Sleeping By Myself that will get you thinking.  There are hard rock songs and ballads.  it's a perfect combination for a perfect band.  I can't wait to start hearing these songs live.  Like a fine wine, Pearl Jam only gets better with age.  Lightning Bolt is a perfect example of that.

B00EUS9JF0|4.0|This CD both disappointed me and pleased me.  I was very pleased with the first half of the album.  This isn't rock and roll anymore.  When I listened to this CD I felt like I was in a coffee house or a quiet night club.  That also is why I was a little disappointed.  Paul has lost a lot of his edge and throughout this CD you can tell he's not singing most of it and has other people singing over him.  Which is fine because he's getting up there in age.  This is a great album.  Far from the best of the year and far from how great I hoped it had been.  Paul still has it, though, and a lot of the young bands of today can learn a lot from him, still.

B0022Q8CSC|5.0|The Godfather is a powerful story about the American Dream. I was afraid it would be dated.  I first read it almost thirty years ago. It was as thrilling and enthralling now as it was then. The Godfather is a slice of life in the infamous crime family, Cordeleone. We dioscover how it grew in the early 20th century to become  the flip side or darker verison of the American dream. Children go to college, and into the family business, only to become deeply entangled in the dark and sinsister world Costa Nostra. While parents may have intentions of having rise their children rise above the terrible things they were forced to do, this book proves that the lure of power is the greatest pullof them all..
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|One of the critical factors I've observed in a lot of things having to do with a retro 1980's pop production in contemporary music is generational awkwardness. While that type of production attitude is becoming more and more appealing these days,many people born in the late 80's and beyond simply hadn't developed that well rounded musical 60's/70's flavor that made 80's songwriting so vital: if one strips all the electronics and other instrumentation away,was there really strong singing and song craft underneath? Honestly? It's been somewhat hit and miss with the modern appropriation of the 80's sound. Este,Danielle and Alana Haim,natives of LA have had somewhat an advantage because the musical world and industry around them is so diverse and fluid-just about every style imaginable and record labels from indie to major to pick up on any talent with something to say. In the case of the Haim sisters,they got snagged up by Columbia. Working with two producers in Ariel Rechtshaid and James Ford-both adept in producing big name stars and more indie oriented acts these sisters-already a promising based on their debut EP,were off to the races on their full length debut.<br /><br />  \\"Falling\\" starts out the album with a wonderfully upbeat dance/pop number that's fluid enough to have a strong pop/rock flavor and keep up a slick funky groove. \\"Forever\\" adds a more upfront bass line to the sound as well a mild ska influenced rhythm that adds to the deeper groove and thick vocal choruses whereas \\"The Wire\\" adds a strong shuffling rhythm to their basic dancable pop uptempo sound\\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\",\\"Don't Save Me\\" and \\"Days Are Gone\\"-co-written by the very talented Jessie Ware all follow that same funky dance/pop flavor to them-and emerge as superb examples of the albums strengths. \\"Honey & I\\" is more of a singer-songwriter type number-with a prominent acoustic flavor and a slightly folk/jazz style songwriting that somewhat recalls Joni Mitchell. This approach showcases what dynamic songwriters they are. \\"My Song Five\\" and \\"Let Me Go\\" all have more swelling arrangements with a somewhat more Celtic type rhythmic flavor-making particular use of the trio's passionate and wailing vocal harmonies. \\"Go Slow\\" and \\"Running If You Call My Name\\" are the tracks that have the most obvious 90's pop/R&B flavor about them but,at the same time,that Celtic/European rhythmic attitude is still present-giving them a unique flavor all to themselves.<br /><br />  On this album the combination of the Haim's spirited vocals,the grooving guitar riffs,the handclap/synthsizer based rhythms and of course the terrific songwriting on every number makes this the idea example of an 80's style modern pop production done as close to perfection as any human being could ask. One of the things that really make it work is that it somehow remains contemporary as well-without so aggressively knocking one over the head with \\"newness\\" that it ceases to have any musical purpose. This group not having a very long history yet,I'd have to say this difficult quality to pull off that Haim seems to have might be based on their musical personality. It seems from a bit of reading that Haim are incredible live,and therefore on a list of groups I'd love to see onstage. This album was recommended to me by my friend Tom Carley who described Haim to me as something of a modern version on Bananarama. That might be as good a description as any. Yet Haim have a musical identity that is very much their own. They are of a certain generation yet are not bound by any of the needs for credibility that forced many contemporary artists of their childhood years into producing mediocre music that simply hasn't withstood the test of time by and large. This album celebrates the best qualities of the 80's pop era-once utterly condemned with pejorative buzz words such as \\"cheesy\\" and \\"irrelevant\\". And for this whole combination of factors,it's a great thing Haim and groups like them are around.s what dynamic songwriters they are. \\"My Song Five\\" and \\"Let Me Go\\" all have more swelling arrangements with a somewhat more Celtic type rhythmic flavor-making particular use of the trio's passionate and wailing vocal harmonies. \\"Go Slow\\" and \\"Running If You Call My Name\\" are the tracks that have the most obvious 90's pop/R&B flavor about them but,at the same time,that Celtic/European rhythmic attitude is still present-giving them a unique flavor all to themselves.<br /><br />  On this album the combination of the Haim's spirited vocals,the grooving guitar riffs,the handclap/synthsizer based rhythms and of course the terrific songwriting on every number makes this the idea example of an 80's style modern pop production done as close to perfection as any human being could ask. One of the things that really make it work is that it somehow remains contemporary as well-without so aggressively knocking one over the head with \\"newness\\" that it ceases to have any musical purpose. This group not having a very long history yet,I'd have to say this difficult quality to pull off that Haim seems to have might be based on their musical personality.

030014332X|5.0|This book is written in a way, it makes me happy, I love it and learn.<br />It has taught me how important it is to make simple, so that a 12 year old can understand, and I can absorb, and remember.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a great game but I have to admit at first I thought it was stupid I would watch my kids play the xbox version and listen to them talk about how great it is. I first downloaded this to my phone but the grafics weren't to great and I had no idea how to do anything on survival so I always played it in creative mode, well the kids showed me how to do all of it then I got my kindle witch made the game even better, the part I like best is multiplayer there should be more games like it, the updates seem to come last on my kindle than other devices but overall I am satisfied with the game itself. I play this game almost every day with or without the kids and I find out new ways to build every time!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|One day I looked up and realized it had been over eight years since Paul McCartney's last pop studio album of all new material [[ASIN:B000P2A242 Memory Almost Full]] came out. That had been a very likable album. As a matter of fact all of McCartney's studio albums since the turn of the millennium have been excellent. Typically he occasionally experiments with classic and electronic genres,sometimes under alternate names. But one of the things that occurs to me is that his longevity isn't based on the cynical viewpoint that he simply cannot age gracefully. It has to do with the fact that Paul McCartney still has enormous amounts of music left in him. Working with different groups of musicians who are inspiring enough to allow him to musically progress, McCartney has delivered an album here that is not only typically strong but surprisingly has many musical references that link Paul's music,old and new,through some unspoken musical stitch in time.<br /><br />  The enormous swells of bass,guitar and piano on the opening \\"Save Us\\" makes for perhaps one of the most musically dynamic uptempo rock song Paul has ever made. And rock it does at that. \\"Alligator\\",\\"Hosanna\\",\\"Early Days\\" and the more uptempo \\"Everybody Out There\\" are nothing particularly new for Paul-with their acoustic based pop sound. But they are done so wonderfully and really effortlessly. With \\"On My Way To Work\\",\\"Queenie Eye\\" and the title song,something really rather amazing takes place: that upbeat,melodic music hall based latter period Beatle era McCartney sound leaps back into the fore with the instrumentation and production being spot on,if of course recorded in a modern way. Beatle admirers will likely love these most of all. Who could blame them? \\"I Can Bet\\" is my favorite-an example of Paul's soulful and funky side,with a spicy Fender Rhodes piano in the mix. \\"Looking At Her\\" and \\"Road\\" showcase a modern electronic sensibility fused with McCartney's incomparable melodicism. \\"Turned Out\\" evokes a modern day Wings type of uptempo melodic pop rocker-another favorite of mine here. The folksy \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" and a beautifully melodic acoustic bonus ballad that I don't know the name two conclude this bonus edition of the album.<br /><br />  Some people with a great deal of expectations of McCartney may likely never have their dreams fulfilled by any new Paul McCartney album. Over the years his musical sound has grown and expended. But the core of his artistry essentially remains the same. The result is him being another of those \\"fine wine\\" artists whose music has aged gracefully and is best taken on its own terms. Personally this is a fantastic Paul McCartney album however you want to cut it. It has everything he does best musically-and done in the best possible way to boot.  Its not the Beatles,its not Wings,and its not any of the other albums McCartney has made within the past decade. What really brings this album to life is the sense of enthusiasm about everything. Even on the slower ballads Paul expresses the ideal mix of passion and ennui that keeps the energy flowing but acknowledges the point in his life which he is in. Even the Rolling Stones have to face it: they are not 20. There's nothing wrong with that-the idea of rock n roll immortality is of course an easy illusion. So Paul doesn't even go for that at all. He delivers all the gusto he came muster here,plus something extra as well. Due to the high quality of the bonus tracks,I'd advise anyone about to pick up this album to get this deluxe edition. In any way you can pick this album up,it's a very welcomed and delightful comeback for McCartney. Again,glad to have him back with such strong new songs!dern day Wings type of uptempo melodic pop rocker-another favorite of mine here.

1250038820|5.0|I follow Humans of New York on Facebook. This book is fantastic and the tangible form of what I have seen on my computer screen. The photographs are beautiful, the pages and color are close to perfect and overall, I don't think I have seen a better photography book.<br />I ordered 12 copies as Thanksgiving gift for various friends and family and received my copy today. I am planning on ordering more. Definitely worth every cent!
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|I now use this bluray when showcasing my home theater (especially to Rush fans). Before the CWA concert this year, everyone came over and we started the night with this disk. The surround is truly great. The only issue in my home theater with the sound is that at the start of the disk, there is very noticeable amplified electronic amp hum in the sound. I know this is from the recording (and not my equipment for example).
B00C1S945G|5.0|hadn't seen the shows in order, much better writing in the second year.  Looking forward to viewing season three in the coming days.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|I enjoy this game when I want to do a busy activity.  It makes me giggle which is always a good thing.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|after hearing reviews was concerned about quality, now that I have it, quality is good to great, youtube comes in at least at 720.  Happy with purchase
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|My son is 13 and we just finishes watching every single episode over the past many months. He absolutely loved them just like I did on reruns when I was 13. I'm amazed that he sat through every disk and wanted to watch them, that is truly the power of Start Trek. I'm considering now buying the Next Generation.

B000002MUN|5.0|This album has the clean, minimal instrumentation characterized by a typical Rubin production. The lyrics are more introspective and there are more slower songs, and the musicianship is very good. Wildflowers is my favorite TP album, and for this era I would start with this album (I like to think about four eras for Petty's music, so I would also go with Damn the Torpedos, Long After Dark, and Into the Great Wide Open from the other eras).

B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This is a review I wrote of this movie some time ago to save my friends from seeing it. I say at the outset there are spoilers and I've done my best to remove all the swearing:<br />If you don't want to read through a long review this is my advice, this is a movie by the numbers if you are able to tune out and enjoy an hour and 40 minutes of a theme not carried out well and no attempt at making art this movie will be okay for you.<br />Anyway here's my review of this movie: Well, this one is not bad folks but it sure as hell ain't good. They did not even try, they did not even make an attempt to make art or push the boundaries of the genre at any level. This isn't even a scifi film, nor a drama of a parent and son trying to connect...It's just grey, nothing there. The script is pretty bad, long stretches without any meaningful dialogue to drive through character development. It's as if they had a check list to make this film- trite use of dead relative to serve as spirit guide- check, ship goes off course and winds up in dangerous area- check, son must save father but father must impart wisdom to be saved- check, and both must overcome a haunting memory- check.<br />90% of the film Will Smith is either issuing a command, marveling at how his son is doing everything wrong, or having a fainting spell. I'm serious, the guy must pass out 4 to 6 times in this movie. I think Will Smith can act in certain roles- he's good at yelling and twisting his face up to deliver a laugh, but he just can't convey a reticent father trying to connect with his son. As such most of the movie he comes off as a fellow who could care less whether the kid lives or dies...and well, you don't like him much. That's an overstatement, with this script you don't care to like or dislike him. The son is pressed for time to save his father but really seems like he too could care less. Seriously this dude takes naps, goes on a Huck Finn voyage, and befriends a giant hawk all on the way to save his dad.Yeah, they contrived him befriending a giant hawk so in the third act the bird could save him. They anthropomorphize a giant hawk...sigh.<br />Anyway, after screw up after screw up, the son is like I'll get on with saving Poppa...and at this point, I could care less; however, I've paid for my ticket, popcorn, a big lemonade, and I'll take my lumps like a man. The kid then goes on to fight some amalgum beast you've seen in a ton of films...sigh...And I gotta say it, after seeing this kid through the 2/3rds of the film you know there is no way he is ready for this. He should die. He deserves to die. Seriously, both of them deserve to die, but he wins and I'm devastated.<br />During the last scene, the director just looses it, looses it completely. He doesn't know how to frame a scene at all. Extras in the film are supposed to be marveling at what this kid who screwed up for 2/3rds of the film just pulled off but the director fails to catch the screen of what they are seeing and the looks on their faces while they look at him. It doesn't matter no one would believe it anyway. Will lies on a medic table possibly dying (framed like 100's of films before- like every 4th episode of Greys Anatomy) and again, I found myself not caring. And well they put a big bow on it and a laugh to end the film (they use a call back to an interlude with a soldier from earlier in the film and well it was expected). Really, it's that bad.<br />So the film ends and I am rooted to my seat. No, I am not watching it hoping for an easter egg bonus scene as it closes, no I want to see who is responsible for this garbage....M. Night Shyamalan as director. Ahhh god, I should have known. This fellow seems to have gone out of his way to direct films as badly as possible. He is now well know amongst movie goers as the fellow that seemed to have such promise then urinated on movie fans, over and over. Then I see the script was written by, you guessed it M Night Shyamalan and this was a surprise, seemsto be the extended family of Will Smith. Everybody wanted to write a line. Given that there was so little dialogue this is entirely possible.<br />What's sad is they could have done something here. They could have taken the 'fear' theme and fleshed it out, but they didn't; in fact that &#34;Fear is a choice, danger is real,&#34; is unfortunately the best line in the entire film. They had a unique view point on fear and did not explore it- that fear marker was an interesting twist. They could have tried to make a visual masterpiece and hired a cinematographer that would have embedded every scene with mood, but they didn't. And they could have worked on developing a father and son relationship but they didn't. This was just grey because they didn't try on any level. I had no idea this was directed or written by M. Night Shyamalan. He got me this time but I'll be more careful the next time.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this solitaire game in spite of the repeated advertisements that come up between every game.  The best game is the winning deal segment.  Even when you know you can win it dose not always come automatically and you must replay the game a number to times to win.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I know this is bleeding edge, but with only streaming from Chrome on a PC and built in Netflix, it hasn't lived up to my expectations.  I was hoping I could stream from my tablet, but that is not the case.  Hopefully more streaming options will come up in the future.  Great idea.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />For the past decade or so, I've been waiting for a Pearl Jam album I could get excited about. Lighting Bolt certainly fits that bill after a decade of sub par albums. Don't get me wrong, Riot Act, PJ and Backspacer have some terrific songs, but they just didn't cut it as whole entities compared to anything since Binaural or Yield.  With Lighting Bolt, it seems the band is slowly returning to their earlier sound, or at least acknowledging it. Yellow Moon sounds like it could fit on Ten, while Mind Your Manners sounds like a cut from Vitalogy. The great thing about this album it is seems to be a little bit of everything, which 20+ years into it, is fine with me. Sirens is a terrific song, as is Infallible and Pendulum. I absolutely love Getaway. Is it their best album ever? Not really. But it's the best they've done in a long long time, which earns it a five star rating for me.

B00459EZLW|4.0|Good show. Shot a lot like the Shield and Battlestar.  Shoulder mount and steady-cam really adds to the sense of action. I just wish they had wrapped up the story and got to show you the ships ultimate destination and findings about the signal they encountered. Even if they did a movie wrap up, like firefly, that would be good too.

0374525153|5.0|This book, although written in English, is a beautiful example of German literature, from its form, the novella, to the atmosphere and world view; a haunting work of nostalgia by an author in exile.  For those who wish to get the spirit of modern German literature, this is much better than most translations, and it is a wonderful read in and of itself.

B009439E7O|4.0|Ill Nino is a band who has never really strayed far from their formula. Starting on their second album Confession, they stuck with the system they felt worked best, and have turned out some decent albums. Albums that have never sweeped me off my feet, but have occasionally caught me with their catchy songs. So when I saw the newest album, while I didn't jump to buy it, I knew it'd be an album I would want to get later, after I got all the other albums I really wanted.<br /><br />Well, once again it's mostly the same, with a just a bit more heaviness. Ill Nino tried to be a bit more heavier, and the one song that shows this change the most is their single \\"La Epidemia\\" featuring the singer from Emmure (a band I'm not too familiar with). Still, mostly the same old. If you've liked Ill Nino's previous works, there's no reason why should be a complete letdown, or a surprise. It's a safe album, and I'm okay with it.<br /><br />The biggest problem I've had with this album is that compared to the other albums, and this could just be me, the singer's voice seems to be a bit lower than the instruments. Something that I know other bands might have, but with Ill Nino, it really bothers me because almost all their songs rely heavily on the catchiness, and melody of the singer to really go into that \\"catchy tune\\" territory. I've played my CD in different players, and while some make it easier for me to understand the singer, the one I use the most (my car) doesn't seem to have the same effect. Which is weird for me cause I never have that problem with any other Cd I own. Other than that though I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Other than that, I did enjoy it a lot. Songs that stood out to me on this album on the first listen were \\"Forgive Me Father\\" and \\"The Depression\\".
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It has been a long time since I found a book I couldn't stop reading. This story is incredibly well written and draws you into each and every emotional twist and turn.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|It wanted me to download a 600mb file just to be able to play the game. No thank you, not worth it.
031623480X|5.0|There is no reason to stay &#34;stuck&#34; in an unhealthy lifestyle when information this valuable is available to us.  I feel that with Dr. Perlmutter and Dr. William Davis writing such great books, with clear and simple solutions to so many health problems, we just need to read the books and put the science and education that they offer us-----INTO ACTION.  Life changing information!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|&#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; is for me a meditation on the cyclic nature of relationships. The story spans centuries, depicting conflict and love between people played by the same actors, so that it seems as if the feelings are memes attached to certain faces which recur over the years. Or is it reincarnation of certain souls and their relationships which have to work themselves out over many lifetimes? Using the same actors as anchors helped make clearer the dynamics of the individual stories in a way that the book could not, which I liked. The second half of the movie brought the story to a cosmic conclusion that was not in the book (and at the end of the movie, unlike the middle in the book); I liked this while I was seeing it, but it is Hollywood-tidy, unlike the more complicated book. However, the movie experience is not a book experience, so I felt quite satisfied; I would happily see it again.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is a great game. You can earn credits in game for free. You can also get<br />double coins forever and there are 2 story lines. I say this game is a 5 star game I really recommend this game.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I couldn't stop playing this game until I got to the biggest level. SOOO amazingly addictive and easy to play!
B00D2I8E46|1.0|Costello's voice is an acquired taste.    If you are interested in smart hip-hop, I recommend the TheeSatisfaction EP.    [...]    Not a shill. Just really think this album is great. Guest appearance from John McWhorter.  Its pretty awesome.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|This is obviously NOT a coincedence. Many kindle fire users are having problems installing this including myself. Please fix, otherwise I think i<br />this game would be good.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Although I am sure the language has been updated, it was great getting to read the original Dracula story. Despite it being a horror story, there are good virtues expressed in the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic setup, need to keep it going. hopefully the themes get even more mysterious and mystical  as they develop. Would love to see a Indiana Jones style mystery develop to be solved.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's a well made and addictive game, I just love how On Nom make faces when he's about to be fed.<br /><br />Con: my fingers are too big, sometimes turning the wheels would cut the rope instead.<br /><br />___________________<br /><br />Es un juego adictivo y muy bien hecho, me gusta mucho como On Nom hace caras cuando el dulce esta cerca.<br /><br />Contra: mis dedos son muy grandes, algunas veces, si no tengo mucho mucho cuidado cuando quiero dar vuelta la llave o la rueda la pantalla toma como si cortara la cuerda.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Very happy with it

B008HJGPVO|4.0|excellent stylus overall, lots of tip options for lots of different uses. seems very durable although would be better if the tips could be replaced when they wear out(correct me if they can). My only complaint is that the stylus could be more responsive, it requires a small amount of pressure to register a touch and can be a disadvantage for some uses.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Just started watching and am so amazed how the relationships and cases develops. In my opinion, not too much drama like the Good Wife but keeps you on your feet. Also, I use the law knowledge I've picked up to anticipate their moves. Wonderful! I am on Season 2 now so I am very eager to see how things come together. Not sure why in the world didn't watch when USA Networks announced.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of the best I have read in a while.  The characters all came together in a unique way and the supense toward the end was great.

0399255370|5.0|I purchased this book for 2 sets of little cousins - all under the age of 6 - and I can't wait to see what they think of it.<br /><br />As an adult, I think it is a great book, with the unique storyline helping children learn their colors and they don't even realize it.  It also reinforces what color(s) make up the everyday items all around them...tree trunk is brown, tree leaves are green (most of the year), car tires are black, etc.<br /><br />Very clever book

B0000041XX|5.0|The Unforgettable Three Tenors. I first saw this performance live on PBS and was so taken with it I bought the CD but loaned it out and never got it back. I have been wanting to purchase it for a while and this item came from the seller, brand new in the original wrap, just as promised and ahead of the promised delivery date. I am very happy with it and anyone who is a fan of classical music will enjoy this unforgettable performance from Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti.

B00DG292SK|3.0|And I'm not sure I particularly like him as a person after.  He seems to be a very selfish, philandering, spoiled addict throughout.  I do give him credit for not whitewashing his flaws, but I am disappointed because I always liked his songs including his solo work.  Sometimes as a fan it's better not to know I guess.  I do wish him the best and hope that he finally finds some peace in all his searching.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|What Sir Paul fan could not love this new CD?  Not every song is amazing but there are definitely some keepers!  Love the title song \\"New\\"...  as an avid Paul fan (who purchases every CD as it is released), I would have to say that this is Paul's best collection in a while.  Amazon offers the mp3 download for free with the CD purchase which is awesome!  Buy and enjoy! :)

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|This chapter of Star Trek definitely caught me, compare to the movie before it. I really liked the improvement and while I'm not watching Star Trek series (only these movies), I would keep this movie in my collection and probably even recommend it to close ones.

B00FWLDHSY|4.0|First, the special effects in this movie are impeccable.  I had to convince myself I was watching CGI!  Incredible.  It was action upon action upon action that kept you glued for the entire 2 hours 11 minutes.  Wow.  It also started with an amazingly poignant social commentary.  The kaiju monsters were wonderfully done, the diversity and depth in creatures and characters and the plot was great.  The only things that brought it below 5 stars for me was the sometimes lack of using bladed weapons when fighting the monsters even though it was highly effective; the comic choppy fast pace it moves at times, and the sometimes stupid comments or plot turns like government decisions.  BUT, IT WAS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING BUYING BECAUSE IT'S WATCHABLE AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Just a tish below 5 stars!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game.  I love it .  It holds my full attention.  Try it it will hold yours too. It is not easy, but it is fun.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|\\"The Final Cut\\" didn't grab me on the first listen but I really enjoy it now.  I'm not going to get in the Waters/Gilmour tussle, I've truly enjoyed Pink Floyd. Many bands have 2 strong personalities or visions and we usually get some great music but eventually they break it off. Listen to the lyrics of \\"The Gunner's Dream\\" and \\"The Final Cut.\\"  There might not be as much guitar work as we'd like but listen and I think this CD will surprise.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I,enjoys, playing this,game. But there's something wrong with it, it, want light up on the screen, when I, turn it, on?
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|WOW!  This gun and accessories is designed so well it blows the already impressive other Nerf dart guns away!  it can be cocked with one hand (a HUGE improvement that helps young kids), it has a ring on the handle for hanging and clipping onto gear or letting other things be hung from it for accessorizing, and it comes with a holster that secures the gun and darts in great and easily deployable way.  JOB WELL DONE, Nerf!

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed to view PDF files on my new Nexus 7.  I checked out the Amazon App store and found the Adobe reader there for my tablet.  There were several other PDF readers to choose from.  However, I picked Adobe.  It was, as I expected, extreemely easy to use, intuiitive, fast, did all the functions I expected it to do--and it was free.  I have total certainty that the Adobe reader<br />will be able to read ANY PDF file (as they are the original creators of PDF)!  Why use anything<br />less?

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Having Evernote on cell, PC, laptop and tablet means my notes are always available. I can't even imagine getting thru a normal (busy) day without it!
B00ER23V1W|4.0|I'm not really going to weigh in on the merits of the score.  I like it enough to give it 4 stars.  What I think any potential buyer should know is that, as with the music from Kubrick's groundbreaking 2001: A Space Odyssey (with which this film shares a good deal of visual imagery), the film's score is partly made up of what I would call &#34;atmospherics&#34; akin to the music of Gyorgy Legeti which Kubrick used in 2001.  This kind of music can, to many ears, sound very unmusical, particularly when divorced from the visual.  Price merely produces a soundscape to convey the emptiness of space or the terror of being adrift in that void.  Buyer beware: there are certainly parts of this score to which you just can't hum along . . . . if that was your intent in the first place.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought this book was heart racing  and scary and exciting all in a great way so so far so good best book ever! Ps next time do like kind of a folk tale theme plz!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dear Mr. King:<br /><br />  I was enthralled by this book from the first page to the last.  It is probably the best sequel I've ever read, made even more delectable by the fact that it was such a long time coming.  I'm a longtime admirer, and I think this book is my favorite, although 11/22/63 is a close second.  I'm writing to let you know I'm humbly pleading, begging even, that when the media people come to you, that you insist that this book be made into a movie, like The Shining, and not a horrible television series, like the one that ruined Under the Dome.  If you must go for television, please consider HBO, as they've done a pretty good job of keeping close to George R. R. Martin's vision with Game of Thrones.<br /><br />  As with all of my favorite books, I'm going to miss Doctor Sleep now that it's finished.  All I can do is hope that when I need him, someone like Dan will be there for me.<br /><br />  Thank you for another thrilling journey of horror and hope.<br /><br />Yours,<br />A Loyal Reader
B007V4LBLU|3.0|Highly questionable film about aggressively drug using crowd of people. Some die, some decline, some question and herein lies the attraction. Questioning is possible, separation is possible. Success is possible. Nicely filmed and poignant.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Really enjoyed the entire book, and - &#34;spoiler alert' - was disappointed in the ending...  Anti- climactic? A let down? Non-descript?  Not exactly sure what I would call it other than a disappointment...
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Ender grows as a character and reflects more on the emotional torment of his past. Traveling from world to world telling truths and histories of the lives of beings, he finds purpose on a distant new world. A place to redeem himself, and restore a race he destroyed thousands of years ago...<br /><br />It's a good read, but not as addicting as the first.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Powerful and riveting, you don't want to put it down. Flick is an independent, fierce, patriotic character you will love. The story moves fast and you're pulled in quickly to the world of 1944 England and France at the height of the Gestapo's rule and terror across Europe. MAJ Franck, a German counter-intelligence agent is dark, brilliant, and a perfect rival for Flick, as she leads a high level (all female) covert operation into the lion's den. Her success or failure is vital to the Allied invasion. A must read!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's so small and unobtrusive. Much better than having a gaming console which takes up a lot of space (and I don't use anyway)!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Quick shopping....exactly what I wanted and no store has it! Happy! Came in ordinal package so I was sure it was new, as the ad read!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Not to challenging but fun to play with.  It does have some higher levels that i have not tried. yet.
B006DGOV9Q|2.0|The description said it would fit my daughter's phone, but the battery is slightly thicker than the factory model.  Luckily the Samsung back plate is slightly flexible and we forced it in and put the phone cover on with a bend in it, then covered with her generic phone cover, hoping it will hold.  The phone still has a short battery life but this must be something unique to her phone as i would not think the new battery would have the same problem as the battery we are replacing.  She should have gotten an iPhone
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app has a good variety of sounds, though some are not very realistic and can actually be distracting. I like being able to use the timer to sleep, though it would be nice to have the option for the sound to fade instead of just turn off. Other than that it is fun to mix and blend!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. What I found that pulled me into the novel the most was the psychological interactions between the main characters.<br />Just the twists and turns within the minds of the players in this story, and the ways those bends changed the outcomes in later chapters, made the next page something to look foward to reading.<br /><br />I have read all 3 of these novels, all in the span of about 2 weeks or so. Makes me wonder if there might be more coming.....<br /><br />Hoping there is more....<br /><br />Soon.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|I have done all  the cleaning on it and it till blinks at me. It is annoying. So I am not happy with it. I don't think it work properly.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a very fun and entertaining game.I think this game is very creative.WHAT I HATE SO MUCH is everything cost so many g-coins, and you only get one of them a day.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First I want to point out that TECHNICALLY this device is considered to be in BETA. That means that it is still being improved and developed.<br /><br />The downside, for streaming TO your Chromecast, is that you are currently limited to a small number of supported android apps and Google's Chrome Browser.<br /><br />The good news is that you can do almost everything you need to already with some performance issues here and there. If your goal is to stream Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music or other web pages you will be very happy. If you are looking to stream DVDs or other video files from your computer than you MAY be disappointed. It is possible to stream video files, but file performance may be lackluster and you have to play the videos through the Chrome browser - not a dedicated video play on your PC. Also, don't expect to be playing your android games or device screen on your TV yet. I have no doubt that will happen, but it currently isn't an option.<br /><br />I was also surprised that the mouse pointer isn't visible when sharing a chrome tab OR your entire PC screen. That would be an excellent addition for presentations.<br /><br />I really think there is a lot of potential with this device. Hopefully it will get better and better over the next several months. For now though, $35 is still a great deal for a very capable device.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I got this mainly for my kids to enjoy and keep them quite while on road trips etc.  They love it!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I got my copy of TWD season 3 and it is exactly how it appears to be out of the box. I've been a fan since the beginning but never read the comics til season 2 came out. The show stands out on its own from the comics and they're both good.The price is worth every penny for this show..currently checking out season 4! Hope they never stop making seasons!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love the book. Quick and quick read. Look forward to reading another jack reacher book.  Recommend this book to all.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I've always had a bit of mixed feeling toward Dreamworks' output.  While they've created some amazing films, they've also produced some mediocre, annoying films that I can't really stand to watch.  I rank movies such as \\"How To Train Your Dragon,\\" \\"Rise of the Guardians,\\" and \\"Megamind\\" among my favorite movies ever, while the endless parade of \\"Madagascar\\" and \\"Shrek\\" films mostly annoy me.  And while their animation and storytelling abilities have improved greatly over the years, their movies relying less and less on quickly-dated pop culture references and celebrity voice actors to cash in at the theaters, I still prefer Pixar for most of my 3D-animated classics.  Maybe I'm being harsh, but then again, this studio did produce \\"Shark Tale...\\"<br /><br />When I saw advertisements for \\"The Croods,\\" I was expecting a film a step down from \\"How To Train Your Dragon.\\"  I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while the film isn't a masterpiece, it's still very entertaining, visually creative, and even sweet.<br /><br />\\"The Croods\\" follows a family of Neanderthals, the titular Croods, as they fight to survive during the awkward pre-civilized days of the world.  Family patriarch Grug (voiced by Nicholas Cage) goes by the philosophy of \\"never not be afraid,\\" and he emphasizes this by forbidding the family from leaving the cave at night or from trying to explore beyond their homelands.  Teenage daughter Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) resents her father's rules and longs for adventure and something new, but gets a lot more than she bargained for when an earthquake destroys the family's cave.  Terrified and lost in a strange new world, the family reluctantly accepts the help of a wandering Cro-Magnon boy named Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds), who claims the world is ending and they have to get to \\"high ground\\" to survive.  Along the way Eep will find the adventure she's looking for, and the entire family, including Grug, will learn that there's far more to life and the world than simple fear.<br /><br />Like most DreamWorks movies, \\"The Croods\\" falls back on a big-name cast to carry it's voices, with such names as Nicholas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, and Cloris Leachman.  Thankfully, the \\"star power\\" of the movie doesn't threaten to overwhelm it, and the voices feel natural coming out of the characters' mouths.  Even Cage, who's notorious for simply playing himself in every movie he's in, does a good job as Grug.  Perhaps playing a voice instead of a face on screen helps him rein himself in a bit more...<br /><br />The animation in this film is great as well, easily on par with most Pixar films.  The environments are lavishly detailed, both the dry desert where the Croods are shown first living and the lush colorful jungles they traverse through in their search for a new home.  The animals in the film are a wild mix, each a blend of two different animals (turtle birds, land whales, piranha birds, dog lizards, two different big cats that are colored and modeled after an owl and a parrot respectively).  This can be a bit jarring for people who know their prehistoric animals or are used to the somewhat more realistic-looking critters of the \\"Ice Age\\" movies, but it does make the movie a visual treat.<br /><br />While not as imaginative a story as some (it's basically \\"The Land Before Time\\" with cavemen instead of dinosaurs), it's still a fun one, and the antics of the family help carry it.  The Croods are a delightfully, well, crude bunch, still establishing basic social mores and showing amazement and even fear at every new sight, whether it's fire or new animals or even something as simple as the concept of shoes.  And anyone who comes from a good-sized family, especially a multi-generational one, can probably identify with at least one of the characters, whether it's the rebellious Eep or the bumbling brother Thunk or even the stubborn but fiercely protective Grug.  Grug's eagerness to see his mother-in-law die can be a bit off-putting, though, and seemed to be a needlessly harsh running gag throughout the movie.<br /><br />While it's not on par with \\"How To Train Your Dragon,\\" \\"The Croods\\" is still one of Dreamworks' better CGI films.  It's visually fascinating, with fun characters and plenty of humor scattered throughout that doesn't lean heavily on pop-culture references to succeed.  It's definitely worth watching, and a great family film.  Probably best for ages 8 and up due to some scary scenes., though, and seemed to be a needlessly harsh running gag throughout the movie.<br /><br />While it's not on par with \\"How To Train Your Dragon,\\" \\"The Croods\\" is still one of Dreamworks' better CGI films.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|There have been a rash of strange murders where their victims wake up drugged and taped and the killer looms over them asking for odd amounts of money and talk about wasting time before he kills. Detectives Jessie Fairlaine and Max Larkin are on the case. There is an interesting twist that ties Larkin to the murderer. This had an exciting plot, not a boring sentence from beginning to end. This is apparently a first in a Max Larkin detective series and I look forward to reading more.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|i spent money on this i stopped playing after first day it was fun but it did not quinch the thirst for gta
B004FOA84A|4.0|Was worth the price I like games that make you think - was worth the price.  I hope they make more.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is similar to Apple's AirPlay, you can cast videos to the TV, but it didn't contain some App inside, so you have to use a Smartphone or a Tablet to cast.  Unlike Apple TV, without a phone or tablet, you can do nothing.<br /><br />Much worse, there are too few apps supporting Chromecast, in my iOS device, only Netflix and Youtube.  I don't have any Android device at hand, so I don't know how much Android app supporting it now.<br /><br />Anyway, it is not expensive, so 3 stars.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This film is a fantastic holiday movie. Beautifully written. Excellent cast (voices). The graphics are truly amazing. If you are looking for a Christmas movie for the whole family, look no further.
B00FEX2ZFG|3.0|I dunno,I guess after 33 out of my 43 years have been spent in a love affair with all that is horror,I have become desensitized to it all.For all the positive hype and claims of it being the scariest film EVER,I found it no more scary then the 1979 version of \\"Amityville Horror\\"(I refuse to acknowledge the existence of the modern version)Don't get me wrong,it was a nice little throwback to that film and others and I feel the quality of the product was good.Maybe not as classic and original as the 1963 version of \\"the Haunting\\" or Richard Matheson's \\"Hell House\\" but it did have some fun moments.Cannot complain about the acting or cinematography,effort was put into this.But it did fail to elicit any shudders,gasps,or lingering fears.I feel like I should have calmed my chomping at the bit to see this and waited till Amazon brought it down to the usual 2.99 rent/9.99 own.Lastly,please remember,this is just one Man's opinion.It is no more or less valid then those who claim this is cinematic greatness.If you managed to get the absolute chills from this film,then I kinda envy you.I am looking for the next thing to get me going but sadly this wasn't it.
0634022296|5.0|The book is a little bigger than i expected, and that is good, my bf loved it, every song is in there, it´s a great piece to collect, it has good quality paper too.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|Sir McCartney has amazed us once again. The behind scenes are extremely impressive. Another great addition to my library has its place
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|was given bad info..doesn't work with my older tv and can't use from my pc..i was told by best buy it would so its a 40 buck waste of money
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast has made TV interesting again.  Whether it is watch Netflix or Youtube it is great!  I have watched 4 seasons of the League,  Orange is the New Black, Breaking Bad, House of Cards.  I love that I can control the device from my phone. Love, love, love it!!
B008LVCKH6|3.0|Great characters. Interesting writing style, but long loooonnnng story which is occasionally repetitive. Overall worth the eras, but probably best saved for a vacation.
B000FBFML6|5.0|This book and series revives my love of reading for pure escape and wonder. I suggest it  with highest regards.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun it is awesome cool nice awesome sick dam cool I will get this app and it is free so buy it !!!!!  !!!!!!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I can not say enough about Michael Connelly.  Everything he writes oozes brilliance whether in a short form or complete novel.  He's the best
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It had been so many years since I read all the Tolkien books that I forgot most of it. Wish, however, that I had noticed it was a 3-parter. I would have waited till they were all out so I could see them all at once. Beautifully made, wonderfully acted. A pleasure to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Book was sooooooooooooo confusing lost me on many  different ways and level but was still kind of good and cool
B009RX7IX8|5.0|The writers have done a great job on this show. The cases that Castle and Beckett work are worthy of Perry Mason. Love the interaction between the main characters.
0385344333|2.0|I really was miserable for weeks after reading this book.  I have so looked forward to each Jack Reacher book being published.  This was a wasted effort.  Maybe Tom Cruise lack of talent rubbed off on Jack Reacher.
0060581808|5.0|Rereading this children's classic was a real treat!  An authentic look at what frontier life was like just a few generations ago. Ideal for reading aloud to kids.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I want to start by talking about Gideon Cross.<br /><br />Who is he you ask? Well, he is your friendly neighborhood entrepreneur, fully equipped with caveman tendencies. He’s young, gorgeous and super successful. He is a run of the mill control freak, with an unlimited income that allows him to track your every movement. He is a genetically blessed, and well-dressed (don’t forget well-endowed), billionaire.<br /><br />Need I go on? Well yes, I do need to actually. He is sex on two muscular legs, has the perfect body, and a black belt in dirty talk. Gideon Cross is the undefeated champion of foreplay, world-renowned exploder of ovaries, national lady bit dampener, and the master dropper of panties.<br /><br />Sorry, I may need a moment. It’s the dirty talk. Gets me right in the uterus. It’s hot (see Exhibit A).<br /><br />Exhibit A: “Wishing I were with you. I’d love to spread you across the hood and **** you real slow. Push my cock deep inside you. Give those shocks a workout”<br /><br />A glass of water might be nice. Feeling a bit parched over here.<br /><br />Gideon Cross would be nauseatingly perfect if it weren’t for the amount of messeded up he is. Instead he is supremely hot, severely damaged, and the dirty talk is probably the best thing about him. Mmmmmm.<br /><br />Sorry.<br /><br />And Eva, well, she’s some annoying blonde chick.<br /><br />All right, Eva does have her good qualities. She sticks up for herself. All these people try to control her life, but she’s spicy and tells them off. She calls Gideon out on his crazy when he slips into his creepy stalker pants. She’s aggressive (sometimes), independent (most of the time), and does not suffer from dead fish syndrome (ever). Also she get’s to have filthy, kinky, crazy, hot, sexy sex with Gideon (see Exhibit B).<br /><br />Exhibit B: “He wrapped my throat with his hand, gripped my hip, and thrust so hard into me that my feet left the floor.”<br /><br />Of course, Gideon proves his awesome, because he appreciates Eva’s active libido. He doesn’t want her sole responsibility to be the counting of ceiling tiles (see Exhibit C).<br /><br />Exhibit C: “You’re greedy and insatiable, and I love it. I love knowing that once I get inside you, you’re going to suck me dry. Then you’ll want to do it again.”<br /><br />They’re basically perfect for each other.<br /><br />Eva is equally damaged, which is why their relationship works well and is so healthy. I’m lying, it’s really really not. They are obsessive, jealous, co-dependent, dramatic, insecure individuals. But let’s be honest, it’s what makes the series so goooood. Admittedly, they both grow a little in this book. Which may be the reason for all the boring. Most of the intense dramatic mess is missing. Eva and Gideon alternate between really sweet to severely dysfunctional. Which meant I alternated between bored and fascinated.<br /><br />There wasn’t that much going on in this book. I did learn a lot about the contents of Eva’s closet. Soooo many outfit changes. I felt like I was in Clueless. Many gyms were frequented, many cars were driven, many lunches and dinners were had during the course of this book.<br /><br />I can’t even say that the book focuses mainly on Eva and Gideon’s relationship, because there is so much secondary character drama thrown in. Everyone has relationship problems. EVERYONE. At first, I thought it would be a good idea if every single character found themselves therapists. The amount of poor decision-making made me want to start eating my hair. And then I realized that they all already have therapists. So I thought that maybe when I finished reading, I would go and get myself one instead.<br /><br />This book left me in knots. I loved it. I hated it. I didn’t know what to think about it. Ultimately, it was a good read. All the elements expected of the series were there, even if they were interrupted by chunks of mediocrity. It was well written. The sex scenes were phenomenal. Eva and Gideon were intense, dramatic, and adorable. I’m giving it 3 Stars.<br /><br />I do recommend Entwined with You, particularly if you’re a fan of the series. There is no insane cliffhanger. There are definitely some loose ends, but nothing too painful. I can wait patiently until the next book.<br /><br />Side note: The BDSM notation is just there for decoration. This series is about two people who suffered horrible past abuse, and are attempting to function in life and in a relationship. The books are dark, sure. But the BDSM is light. It’s there, but barely. It’s not much of a focus point in the book. I think some people would be beyond irritated if they go into this expecting a romance involving BDSM.l written.

B008LV8TSU|5.0|I found this book in a very roundabout way. I had watched the movie by Hayao Mikazuki ( I hope I got the spelling right) and I love both versions on their own. Two completely different stories, I enjoyed Sophie's strength in the novel as her character developed and she became more sure if herself and her talents. My favorite bit is when she beats the fire demon with Howl. I could never get over Sophie helping out the witch in the movie. I would definitely suggest this for tennis and young adults. The connection in terms of understanding personal development, character, and integrity is superb!
0316069434|5.0|I can not say enough about Michael Connelly.  Everything he writes oozes brilliance whether in a short form or complete novel.  He's the best.  The Black Box is as great as the book that hooked me The Black Echo.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Wow this book is so very simplistic not a single plot twist that was not anticipated four chapters before.  The character development is one dimensional and the story advances far too quickly to pull you in.
B00EH0K9H8|1.0|As mentioned by previous reviewers, this pressing is defective, audio but no picture on either a Sony RMT B100A player or PS3. Very disappointing.
1476727651|3.0|I knew Steve King as a kid. He lived next door to my Grandparents. When Carrie came out, I realized that this guy I'd known as a child was a published author. How cool, I thought, and have since purchased everything he's written, because he's good—damn good. His novels either grab you right off the bat or they don't. This one didn't. Don't get me wrong, in the end I was glad I read it and happy with the purchase, but as a writer myself, I thought that there was way too much character development and it was very slow moving until about page 300. This novel could have kicked ass at about 350 pages, but there were, in my opinion, way too many wasted words. Even though it's a sequel to The Shining, I think he wrote this for people who have never read it. All in all, a great read, but most of his novels keep me awake and unable to put them down. I read The Stand in 2 days. No food, no sleep. This one took me a week.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|Will Smith needs to stop trying to promote his son's acting career. This movie is one of the worst science fiction flicks I've ever seen. There is more entertainment watching a 24 hour marathon of SpongeBob Squarepants.
B00009NQQO|1.0|This looked like a really cute toy for the bathtub for my 2 year old son to play with but it is nothing but junk. We have had it about 1-2 weeks and already the one suction cup broke and I tried glueing it back in but it still won't stay suctioned to the bathtub wall.  The 3 balls it comes with are OK but I wouldn't bother wasting any money on this product.  It's too bad because it is a very cute idea!
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie.  I haven't liked most non sci-fi movies about space.  Boring. I only went because it was the only movie available at the time I had available.  I was shocked to find this movie to be amazing on many levels.  Good plot.  Truly scary and tense ( and i'm pretty jaded). Very good acting. Incredible visuals.  And very thought provoking.<br />  BUT YOU MUST SEE THIS IN IMAX 3D. The 3d is essential to give you the feeling of weightlessness in space, a crucial part of the movie's experience.  And the IMAX  to give an appreciation of the magnitude of it all...incredible panoramas of earth or depicting the enormous emptiness of space sprinkled with stars.  As a backdrop to the astronauts, it makes you feel very small.<br />  Trust me.  You gotta see this.  No matter your taste, its sure to punch your gut and tantalize your brain.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|As with all of the anime I have seen from Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli the animation detail and colors are exquisite .<br />Story wise there are no spirits or magical aspects, so, it is different from his other fantasy films.  But as with most of his films there are interesting characters and the story line pulled me in to care what happens to the main characters.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Absolutely amazing album! I love every song! By far my favorite band of all time!!!  They're equally amazing live as well!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For the essential use of this app.  It's very well done. Very useful for those who are looking for something fee that really works and its worry free.  Well done and an awesome job.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I ARE VERY HAPPY THAT WE GOT THIS MOVIE!  ORDERING WAS EASY, WE HAD THE MOVIE RIGHT AWAY.  IF YOUR FAMILY ENJOYS STAR TREK OR SCI FI,  THEY WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I liked everything about it - the AA stuff, a new kind of bad guy, meeting new people with &#34;the shining&#34;  and how they all work together.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|This app does what it says it will do.  It tells you the weather, and when you connect to the internet, it updates. There is one major downside, though: it appears to drain the battery at a high rate, and slows down the charging process.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If show great features, weather, great  tones to wake up to . This clock is a very cool thing to have would recommend to anyone.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great read; got better the further I read. Can't wait to begin the next one. Bound to be good, too!
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I love this album! Every tune on it is heavenly! Many are from films Morricone has written the score for, so you will know them. This is the kind of music that soothes the soul, and can bear listening to over and over.
0920668372|5.0|This was the first book given to my mother when she found out she was expecting me back in 1990. She would read it to me every night before bed and to this day she signs her cards to me with \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\"<br /><br />When I found out I was pregnant with my son, this was the first purchase I made. I have such fond memories of my mother reading it to me and I'd love to share the experience with him. If only I could stop blubbering halfway through it. I love that this book is now published in both English and Spanish as well. My husband and I plan on raising our son bilingual so that he can easily communicate with both of our families. I was sure to buy a copy of each when I discovered it.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Enjoyed it but was offended by much of the use of God's name in vain.  People I associate with do not use that type of language...it was written so long ago that I just put up with it.  I think seasonal worker's still live in pretty much the same terrible conditions and mistreatment.
B000NQRE1E|2.0|Wasn't impressed by this moronic film other than the very beginning with the underwater scenes. Here you have a suicidal Rose that probably should have jumped and saved everybody the 3 hours watching this. How it garnered all those Oscars I will never know which is another story unto itself.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fay has a different, delightful way of looking at the world.  I enjoyed every minute of this book and hope she writes another one eventually.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|The absurd amount of CGI explosions, mind-numbing fight scenes, plot holes, some weird editing cuts, and a few other let downs just ruined the movie for me, I was extremely disappointed. I'm just bored with CGI and explosions every 5 minutes, the fight scenes were drawn out and boring as well, it felt like I was watching a video game. We get it Hollywood, computer technology has advanced enough for you to spend all your budget on making computer generated worlds and huge, shiny explosions, it doesn't mean the audience enjoys being bombarded with it throughout an entire movie. I want a story that grips me, I want to feel something strong for the characters, if I feel nothing for freakin Superman then you completely failed as a director/producer.<br /><br />I asked myself why I still prefer the original Superman (Christopher Reeve) to these latest ones and it's because these new Superman movies lack any emotion, it's all fake. Hollywood is catering to the small minded people and it really sucks.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The only thing I didn't like was there wasn't any inserts/booklets with info (just something I like so im not affecting the rating) Other than that for the price I got it for (dailey deal) it is worth it 10 times over!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the game because , the graphic is so good and you will the new Orleans version  and the part I liked about is characters
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This is a good movie and very heart touching. It's also educational. I recommend this movie as a family night watch.
0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan a great book for 5th graders on up. This book is about Percy who is a twelve year old who feels very out of place in the world. What he discovers is that he is out of place. He is not a normal twelve year old boy. This book tells of his adventures of figuring out who he really is and what a difference he can make. I really like this book because it is a fictional book that describes Greek mythology. It is a great way to learn about other cultures without having to get bogged down with lots of terminology.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great story with steamy erotic scenes!!!  Better than 50 shades!  This series is fantastic and is guaranteed to help a relationship in the bedroom!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great product does internal battery is amazing I can go about 3 or 4 days between charges and it's pocket sized and convenient.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I'm backwards, I saw the movie The Avengers and then started watching the Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America. I've never been a fan of comic book character movies but I did end up like the Marvel story line and now I'm hooked. Keep in mind I've never read any of the comic books so I never know whats going to happen until it comes out on the big screen.<br /><br />I like Captain America, he comes from a more simple time - back when it was OK to say I love God and my country. I like how he fits in with the Iron Man character. The movie is well acted and has a good plot, I've seen it twice.
B000ZBUY78|1.0|From the first use worked poorly, showed delays of a couple of minutes per hour. They had to send for repair.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Very good movie if u like slow old school gangster movies such as the godfather & American gangster. It's a classic!!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Poignant, sparing of verbiage. Very easy to live in the stories that she writes. Timeless and authentic in the emotions and feelings shared.
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|I bought this book based on the good reviews. but after reading the book, I kinda regret. I think I could use the money to buy a more interesting book. These four agreements are simple, understandable. For me, I have read the similar principles in somewhere else, this book is little disappointing to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so  awesome I mean the minion beach, guru's lab and all the other levels on this game is great. I really recommend this game.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Overall a very well written and rounded story. From beginning to end you get attached to &#34;Katniss&#34; and can easily follow the world she lives in. You get attached to the characters and their lives feeling pain and sorrow.
0446555002|4.0|Mystery of his wife is solved. A new antagonist arises! Future plot threads are created. One back story is filled in. I'm an SF fan myself... but these guys keep me buying books!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Well let me tell you this movie rocks the first blu ray I bought that was in 7.1surround awesome awesome awesome.<br />.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|FYI, Haim is wonderfully amazing live in concert. Feels like forever since I've heard an original and likeable sound, after hearing lots of synth pop lately. I like synth pop a lot, but Haim sounds fresh and soulful. It's also been a while since a whole album sounded great, rather than 1 to 4 good songs on one album (listening from a spectrum of artists). Get it and you will enjoy them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is grate get it as it is fun it is also a great way for you and your friends  to have a friendly contest
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Although this is a simple match tiles type game, the cube shape adds another dimension to play, and makes it more interesting than say, the standard Mahjong type game.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was  truly a life perspective changing book that I will forever refer to for the rest of my life
B00EEN7CAK|2.0|It was just a tiresome, boring movie. I don't blame the actors, I blame the subject matter and characters they had to play.  The most interesting part was what they stole. Still, not that that interesting.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This is a simple scroll and jump type of game, but the granny graphics add something special and hilarious to the mix. I highly recommend this game... plays smoothly and perfect on my GS3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the should have more updates,but uhhh well I really love this app. Nothing wrong but one thing, THE NETHER TOWERS ARE NOT MADE OF OBSIDION...NEED UPDATES...NEED UPDATES...UPDATES NEED 'EM
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app combines several features I want and appreciate. Works really well for me. I use it instead of my alarm clock, especially on the road.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This is a great example of this type of game. lots of fun to play, and keeps you interested. Plays smoothly with no glitches or problems on GS3.
B001Q8FRVC|5.0|This is one of the best album ever!!!<br />Each is better than other one!!<br />In each track we have a new sensation!<br />PURE ROCK AND ROLL!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game however I wish there was a way to earn more crystals. My daughter tries to steal my game while I am playing.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This would be a good addition to your art program collection. It is a bit different than most other offerings. Could use more instructions built in when first using the program, but it's worth learning.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a good story, very well written and very interesting. The story was easy to follow although the last part of the plot took a very different turn than what I thought was going to happen. All in all it is a good book.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Every time I hear the first single from a new OR album on the radio, I am hooked. This includes Native. One Republic continues to evolve and make great music.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|While there are a lot of good ebook readers available, this one makes it particularly easy to use with your amazon account, especially if you own a kindle already, and want to share the content with an android device.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Game is great although not that easy to go from level to level.Would suggest friends and family request this godd game.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I loved the basic concept of this book. Live within your means, save for the future. It's nice to be reminded of what's important. While I appreciate the numerous tables and graphs and numbers, I could have lived without them. I didn't need proof of the concepts from the author(s), as their credibility was well established in the beginning. I think all young people should read this book to set themselves up for success, and they should re-read it every few years to remain focused on the future.
B00594XOZU|1.0|If I could I wouldn't give any stars. It's stupid. Tried deleting and downloading so many times. Piece of garbage. Don't get this app. It's honestly a waste of time.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The most  realistic gun sound app ever. If you like this you'll love weaphones 1<br />Though I can never find how to update it.
0811875555|5.0|I absolutely love \\"Tangled\\" and this book is such a wonderful addition to my collection of merchandise. Full of beautiful concept art and interviews/stories from the people who brought it to life. Definitely a must-have for any \\"Tangled\\" fan.
0345529057|5.0|You can watch the series, but you can read what the writer created.  Great series of books.  My son is enthralled with this set.  He is a voracious reader.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am obsessed with this author he is funny and he always puts a exciting twist in every book he writes he is a gem. Thanks to him I am now fascinated by Greek and Roman history I can't get enough of this sequel series to Percy Jackson
B0058YPILY|5.0|Loved it wished season 8 was cheaper then I will be caught up but I can wait for the price to go down
B002VWNID6|5.0|I was very happy that I found this movie on here. It was a lot cheaper than the stores and I received it in a timely manner. I greatly enjoyed getting my movie. I love watching Robin Hood movies so I was glad to order this one. I was even glad to see that I could order this brand new on here. Very Happy!
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|If you are a Rod Stewart fan - then yes this is brillant.<br />The album brings back memories of the raw and rich talent Rod showed in his early years.<br />he bought to life the music we truly loved from him - delivering performances on this album that i believe revealed his love for performing, and yet also showed his humour with different versions of some classic
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great completely free language learning application. It plays sort of like a video game, making it very entertaining and simple. There are many languages to choose from.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|How a movie can rivet you without having little or no dialogue is cinematic genious. It's a classic. This was one of Tom Hanks' best roles.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|Builds on and improves on her previous album. There is a noticeable continuity between them, as she sticks with her distinctive folk/jazz sound and even covers Dylan again... but the songs are more polished, the musicianship better, she is just better at what she does.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great to see the weather on locations important to me at just a push to open this great application, great!
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|This book is written more like a combination of short stories. The themes are rushed and jump 30 years in some cases without fully developing each story. The author tries to link each individual story but the links are vague and weak. I really struggled through this book which was disappointing as I could not put the last two down
0812993845|3.0|I'm a big Sophie Kinsella fan, and I read her books for the fun escape from reality.  This one, though, strayed a bit too far from reality for my tastes.<br /><br />Lottie and Fliss are sisters who are both going through romantic turmoil.  Lottie is expecting her boyfriend to propose, and Fliss is recovering from an antagonistic divorce.  When Lottie's boyfriend shuns the idea of marriage, her story takes a dramatic turn.<br /><br />There are fun and engaging moments in the book.  And it's always fun to see how Kinsella's characters navigate through the story's twists.  Unlike other Kinsella novels, I didn't root for the main characters much.  An ok beach read, but not of the caliber of &#34;Can You Keep a Secret&#34;.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book does an excellent job of outlining the many problems that gluten consumption and over-consumption of carbohydrates can cause regarding the brain, central nervous system and beyond. It gives detailed explanations of why gluten is a health hazzard including the history and changes in wheat, rye and barley processing and crop modification, as well as why gluten sensitivities have increased in recent history. It also provides practical information about how to eliminate gluten from your diet, how much fruit and other carbohydrates are really needed to be healthy, how to protect the brain from many incurable diseases and how to increase your chances of maintaining a healthy mind and nervous system well into your golden years. Grain Brain includes diet plans and recipes as well. I recommend it to everyone I know who suffers from migraines and intestinal problems to Alzheimer's, CFS or Parkinson's, as this diet significantly improved the symptoms of my own neuro-immune disorder.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|This was an entertaining game. It's along the lines of Bejeweled and others like it. The music is soothing and the scenery is pretty. It was the app of the day, but after playing it, I would have paid a couple of dollars for it. I think it's worth that.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I had no idea what life was like in the camps, or really that they even exist. This will be the German concentration camps of our generation.<br /><br />Easy read and very entertaining.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|...no matter where you are. You can grab a photo from your folder, edit it anyway you want; black/white, sepia, contrasts, brightness, cropping and resizing is just as easy as on your computer. Great lil app.
0385350864|2.0|I love Bridget Jones, so much so that I got off work early today just to read this novel I have been waiting for. The novel where I hoped Bridget and Mark finally worked out all the kinks and were having a baby, only to have Daniel come in and mess it all up. I mean come on... third times a charm right? I wanted to be shocked by this whole book so I read none of the clues or hints dropped leading up to the release. But I hated this book and I don't use that word lightly. The book starts off talking about people and things COMPLETELY unfamiliar to me and in a way that looks like a vomiting Twitter feed. Once characters are explained I'm left thinking - why the hell so much later in life? Why am I getting invested in these new characters when the old characters are wilting away with little care? We missed all the good stuff?  Where it does pick it it stumbles into things unknown again and then the bomb drops... Fielding killed off one of the most beloved, ESSENTIAL characters of the novel. The death was heartfelt and meaningful I understand, but the other books felt me believing in love, no matter how difficult and meddled., but this book felt me thinking \\"Well I'll lose the love of my life, but I guess I'll have to move on.\\" This book left my heart sad. I understand Bridget is more grown up and a different woman, but I agree with other reviewers, she lost her heart.

Even more importantly, I love it because it is a product of a young man's dreams. Despite nay sayers and bumps in the road, he stuck with his vision, worked hard and now it has paid off. Well done, Brandon Stanton. You earned it.

B006H5120E|4.0|The 3D aspect was just OK. That due more to the fact that the movie wasn't filmed to be 3D so when they add that later it's fun, but not amazing. My husband had never seen the movie, and I knew he'd at least give it a try in 3D.
1250038820|5.0|I've been following HONY on Facebook for about a year and a half, and seeing the pictures posted daily was one of the best parts of my day. Stanton's pictures capture not just the people of New York, but the spirit of people everywhere. When my book arrived today my boyfriend said \\"now that's a coffee table book!\\" I just shook my head and responded, \\"no, it's actually meant to be looked at.\\" Going through it the first, of what I'm sure will be many, times, I laughed, cried, and stared in shock at the images. Brandon Stanton had accomplished something incredible- he has connected strangers in such a way that anyone, from a little girl in pigtails to old men playing chess, can show what it means to be a human.

B00506NRBS|5.0|This was one of the most important books I've ever read. And especially at this time in my life. I've been self-employed with a direct sales company for 34 years. I love, love, love being a consultant and servicing my customers. And I've been successful enough in management to drive free cars and win oodles of diamonds and other great prizes. But I'm starting to feel &#34;done&#34; with the management part and am certainly less effective at it than ever before. I believe every word you wrote...but that's never been a validated line of thinking in my world, even though I've always known it was my truth. I'm already spending much time thinking and tinkering with my next project. I believe this book was the permission I was seeking. Thanks, Derek.
B00C7BZYRO|5.0|The Spectacular Now is this years Perks of Being a Wallflower, and perhaps even better.  I headed into the theater without knowing the story or seeing the trailer (I had only seen its high reviews on Rotten Tomatoes), and I came out knowing I'd seen a great movie.  The movie has a great balance of drama and comedy that is hard to get right.  It is a bare-bones movie, with most of the scenes having to be filmed in one or two takes, and I think that helps the quality of the film.  Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley give great performances here.  You can tell this was a passion project, everyone working on the movie did it because they wanted to, not because of the money.  While the content makes me hesitant to recommend to young viewers, the film is a must for anyone that is in their High School or College years.  Ultimately, the film did not receive the attention it should have, so it's box office numbers suffered.  It will, like Perks, be completely overlooked come awards season even in what I consider a down year.  Still, make sure you see this one when you can.  The Spectacular Now is one of the best films of 2013 and proves that 'Coming of Age' stories still have plenty of life in them.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is an extraordinary book.  It is romantic, funny and horrific. I almost hesitate to recommend it.  Always compelling, sometimes unbearable , unique.  I read this then reread it .  Perhaps not for everyone but it still stays with me.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|The problem with this book is that it does not draw you in to its reality. There is no explanation for why a society led by such flawed people should last of thousands of years. Because of that, statements by the characters are occasionally nonsensical, like a young girl who talks about the \\"olden times\\" of a couple hundred years ago. There are no \\"olden times\\", everything else in the book talks about the kingdoms that have been there, unchanged for centuries. Some legends are discussed later, but they add little flavor or logic to the story.<br /><br />The backdrop is described without consistency. At one point someone is riding through an old Dothraki city, scattered with statues stolen from the kingdoms they plundered. This is the first mention of such kingdoms. How can the 7 kingdoms be so stable and all around there are civilizations springing up only to be plundered by the Dothraki? If such warring is going on, there should also be change as different civilizations come into contact with each other. But no such change is discussed.<br /><br />The characters, the Lords, Kings and Princesses act as if they are the ones that shape the world and keep it stable. But they are flawed and unstable people, superstitious, getting drunk, taking whores, murdering children and staging fights to the death. I could enjoy that fantasy, if it made sense, if there was something behind it to explain a burial hall of Kings going back centuries or a society that has survived while treating half its population like chattel (I'm referring to women). Occasionally a girl will complain about her arranged marriage, or express a desire to be a Knight, but why, if these characters have those thoughts, has nothing ever come of it from all her ancestors who probably had similar thoughts?<br /><br />In all of this, the people who are providing the arrow fodder, growing the food, and guarding the castles are almost completely ignored. Rarely are they ever mentioned and they only show up to open a gate or cause a problem for the elite to handle. I can only see the appeal of this book to the world's upper 1% or to young boys who think this is how the real world works.en a gate or cause a problem for the elite to handle.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was hesitent about this, I love some of Mr King's work and others, not so much. I loved the Shining, it's a genuine classic and one of the few books that truely freightened me when I read it (I've revisited it twice more since the original reading) and I was afraid the followup would be a disappointment. I was, thankfully, afraid for nothing, I was very satisfied with Doctor Sleep. Nothing could be as freightening as the original first read of the Shining, but this got as close as one could hope. If you liked the Shining, it's worth your time to read this one.<br />Thanks Mr King<br />:-)

B00E4W40C4|5.0|The Wolverine was very enjoyable. It was smaller in scale than most \\"superhero movies,\\" and that's perfect because Logan is decidedly not a superhero and a Wolverine film ought not to resemble a \\"superhero movie\\". The physicality of the action sequences was fantastic. The casting was great. Hugh Jackman is still perfect for the role after twelve years, but the Japanese cast members really stole the show! Hiroyuki Sanada was brilliant as the wicked Shingen.<br /><br />Of course, as a fan of Chris Claremont's original Wolverine solo story, there are some things I would have liked to have seen done differently with the story and character. However, considering that this is always the case with comic book inspired films, The Wolverine still does not disappoint.<br /><br />For those interested in a more critical view, an interesting and thoughtful critique of The Wolverine can be found here: [...]<br /><br />While I definitely enjoyed the film more than any other comic book movie in recent years, the author of the above review definitely brings up some aspects of the Wolverine character that could have been more present. Nevertheless, I highly recommend The Wolverine for any fan of the character or genre, or for anyone simply looking for an enjoyable and entertaining movie experience. The result is a movie that seems more deliberate and less erratic.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am fortunate enough to have recently seen an advanced copy of the extended cut. It is definitely an improvement on what was already a uniquely interesting film. The extended cut features more dialog among the Japanese charachters, a few new scenes that help with the development of the characters and plot, and an much-extended version of Logan's fight against the Black Clan.

B0090SI4LU|4.0|After watching this movie, then seeing the rash of harsh critics I was not amused.  I liked the movie enough to actually write a review. Here are some happy after thoughts for me. 1. Stephanie Meyers.  Didn't know who she was until I started looking for the book to read after I watched The Host. Now I know she's a well talented love story artist. 2. Max Irons. Yeah, Jeremy's boy... also think King Edward of The White Queen... I'd say we have another &#34;Irons&#34; to notice when weighing our entertainment choices.  3. William Hurt turns in another impressive performance that makes some spots in the movie that might have been awkward run rather smoothly. 4. After some time thinking about this movie, I believe Saoirse Ronan did an admirable job with a very difficult character to play. And 5. An actual character growth and change driven science fiction plot. If we had more of those type science fiction movies, science fiction would not be relegated to SyFy Channel's struggle for mediocrity.<br /><br />This movie jumps to the end of the worn out Body Snatcher plot to begin its story. Then it develops... characters meet challenges that change them, for better or worse. If you need a boom and a bang followed by million dollar CGI to hold your attention you might want to skip this one.  If you want to feel something and be entertained, even a heart string pulled here or there, this just may be one of your favorites.  I'm going to watch it again, if only to see if I can figure out where this harsh criticism is coming from.
B00180R06I|1.0|\\"Vampyr\\" is a 1932 black and white French-German horror film about vampires. It was the first sound film for Danish director Carl Dreyer (1889-1968), following his success with \\"The Passion of Joan of Arc\\" (1928). The film stars no one you ever heard of or saw again, but is notable for the photography from Rudolph Mate (1898-1964) who went on to 5 successive Oscar nominations between 1941 (\\"Foreign Correspondent\\") and 1945 (\\"Cover Girl\\"). Mate was a favorite of Dreyer and also worked with Alexander Korda and Karl Freund. He later turned to directing and made several memorable films including \\"The 300 Spartans\\" (1962), \\"When Worlds Collide\\" (1951), and \\"D.O.A.\\" (1950).<br /><br />It's impossible not to compare \\"Vampyr\\" with \\"Dracula\\" (1931) both of which are early sound productions about vampires. Dracula was one of the preeminent horror films of all time, and helped cement the position of Universal Studios along with \\"Frankenstein\\" (1931), \\"The Mummy\\" (1932), and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1932). But \\"Vampyr\\" pales in comparison to any of these films, and is more kindly compared to softer horror films like \\"The Black Cat\\" (1934) and \\"Cat People\\" (1942) which are more atmospheric rather than pure horror.<br /><br />There is an audience for \\"Vampyr\\" as is evident from the many positive reviews on this site. It's not the normal horror film audience and it's not for silent film fans either. Fans of German expressionism may find something to like here.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a long time fan of Mr. King, I've found that some of his later books felt \\"hurried\\" or rushed out just to get another \\"King Book\\" on the shelves.  Most have been good, a few not so good but this one is really great IMHO!<br />It was more like the earlier King's writing, but somewhat \\"kinder\\" and I'm sure that's not the word.  There were plenty of shocks and twists and turns.  More than enough to keep me reading long into the night.<br />I finished the book last night (or should I say in the wee hours of this morning).  All the ends were neatly tied up, the ending was just a little bittersweet..time does move on I suppose and for me, this is definately one of Mr. King's best books.  It made me remember all the reasons I became a fan of his in the first place.<br />Kudos Mr. King, story very well told.  Thank you for reminding me, you're one of the best.<br />Don't miss this one especially if you've visited the infamous Overlook Hotel!!<br />I'm very pleased with the way Danny grew up.  He's got a heart of gold and nerves of steel, his Mom would be proud.
B003FBMS4W|5.0|John Ford was such a brilliant director. This movie is so powerful despite all the little flaws.  Ford makes the actors come over so strong in their emotions and his camera shots just accentuate the drama and emotion.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This is an awesome book and I have read the books up to eleven. However I do think that this book AND BOOK NUMBER THREE ESPECIALLY is not for young readers at all. It has inapropriate content to the MAX. I do not recomend this book for readers under the age of fiteen. I suggest you go through health class first. If you want to read this series just make sure you know what is in it first.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I must say, Hollywood has reproduced the same kind of horror movies for generations, which most are pretty bad.  Every once in a while, a super movie is made and this is one of them.  I rank it up there with The Changeling, Poltergiest, Paranormal Activity and The Shining.  This movie has great acting with scary visual and sound effects to go along with.  It is well worth owning.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I decided to read this series after religiously watching the TV series.  The characters are really interesting.  I actually liked the TV series interpretation of what happened to Sean's career better.  Edgar was wonderful...fast forward to the last book in the series so far:  The Sixth Man; where Edgar is introduced.<br /><br />The story was very complex and I agree with another reviewer that the last 1/4 or so of the book was really bogged down.  None the less, I loved the book and would recommend it to any fans of the now defunct TV series because that is the only way you are going to get your King & Maxwell fix.<br /><br />You are introduced to Michelle and learn how Sean & Michelle teamed up.  It also gives you the background story of these two agents that was missing in the TV series.  All in all I really enjoyed it.  Baldacci is brilliant.  I have read one other series of his that I enjoyed, but not nearly as much as this one.

1451626657|5.0|I've read many books and without hyperbole, can mark this one as my most favorite.<br />I've read this book twice now and have gotten a different outcome each time.<br />The first time through I found it to be a laugh-out loud satyrical novel that was poking the ribs at the hard exterior of war fiction.<br />The second time through I found that there were much more profound and numbing moments that are absolutely beautiful to read and poetic. ( The scene in the hospital about forcing death to behave is amazing)<br />The wit, humor and absurdity of the characters is what drives this novel the most. In very few circumstances can you say that the plot of a book came second, but I find in this case that you spend most of the time marveling at the characters and lose track of what's really taking place.<br /><br />The book centers around a rather intelligent and lusty pilot named Yossarian whose major flaw is that he's wise enough to see through the nonsense that the chain of command is trying to feed him and decides to buck the system with hilarious results.<br />I'll keep it brief and just summarize by saying that I've never quoted so many different lines so many different times than I have with Catch 22.

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, and this is now my favorite version of it. The challenge of moving the action into the 21st century might seem to be daunting--after all the major plot point is accusing a woman for being unchaste on the night before her wedding. A 21st century Western audience might view the male characters all piling on to publicly humiliate the woman as totally out of proportion to the offense even if it were true.  But the deceived groom and the falsely accused bride are presented as both shy and unsophisticated people, put into an intolerably painful public display. It worked.<br /><br />What also worked that I have never seen done so well in ANY production of Much Ado was Nathan Fillion, as Dogberry and his equally brilliant Keystone Cop-style Watch. Shakespeare's clowns can be painful rather than funny to a modern audience. I usually suffer in silence as Dogberry does his clumsy constabulary duty. But Nathan Fillion's brilliant evocation of a Dogberry straight out of a noir cop movie made me laugh, laugh again and look forward to seeing it many times and laughing yet again.<br /><br />I haven't said anything about the Beatrice and Benedict in this performance--superb! Enough said.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show for the quality of the characters, the setting, and the historical background it shares.  The drama and tension and love between the characters offers the viewer some nail-biting moments as well as funny moments.  The show truly shows compassion for fellow humans and encourages viewers to take the high road in our own lives.  It is not all polly-Anna-ish for sure.  Displaying the classist thoughts of the era is eye-opening and outright disturbing but no surprise.  Overall love most characters and the great costuming and setting as well as the plot line.

And this bluray release is also amazing, it comes with bluray 3d, bluray, dvd and digital download in one package. Digital audio is unbelievable. But I am sure they will make another release a few years down the road with more extras just trying to take more money from us devoted fans, that's the way corporative studios work those days...

B0084QWB0O|4.0|Under most circumstances, I don’t enjoy reading books. However, this novel kept me interested with its characters, details, and saddening story of a true American hero. After reading this novel I have a much greater respect for the men and women of our armed forces than I did before. The courage that these men and women, especially the Navy SEALs, have is unreal. The acts that Marcus did to stay alive were not capable of ordinary people like us and his mere will to survive was extraordinary. If you are one who greatly respects and is interested in the duties of our armed forces or you are intrigued by survival stories, then I suggest that you read this. I gave this book four stars because of the reasons listed above, but while this book was well written and very interesting, it had its flaws. I was not fond of the chapters that talked about the training that the SEALs had to go through. I felt this subject should have been covered in about two chapters, instead of about four. That was the portion of the novel that I disliked the most, and other appearances that bothered me were very minor. Overall I did enjoy this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game•  visit this site everyday.  I am addicted lol.  BETTER THAN CANDY CRUSH.  Such a cute Kitty.<br />Sharon
B00DJZR46G|3.0|I've been listening to Elton religiously since 1969, and musically, this is the in finest set of compositions he and Bernie have released in 30 years.<br />I only wish they had asked someone else to sing it.
B00EO4SBSG|3.0|I was worried about the Dramen connection and I was right, sounds a little too much Disturbed.  My issue with Trivium is that they try to re-invent themselves on each release to gain a bigger following & payday.  The key to doing it is touring with the right bands, maybe touring with a more mainstream band..??  I like the band (killer live) and will continue to listen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|but I tried using skin stealer and it wont authorize it id like that to be possible if h could at some time
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was one of the best books you will ever read. I loved it from beginning to end. I really can't say enough about this book. It was a really good mystery and suspense story. Couldn't put it down.
B004G6009U|5.0|was great Disney film.enjoyed the  singing the action and  the great ending.It show evil and bad  never win. Great for kids.
B000002LIR|4.0|ROD STEWART-STORYTELLER/THE COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY 1964-1990: STORYTELLER racks up four disc's worth of mostly solid efforts from frog throated tartan rocker ROD STEWART including huge hits, near misses and a few obscurities. This ambitious tribute chronicles the raw RNB-fueled \\"hungry years\\" tackling SONNY BOY WILLIAMSON and HOWLIN' WOLF, his acclaimed folk phase that begat EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY and the morning after saga MAGGIE MAY, and later triumphs including passion pit ballad TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT, bawdy party starters STAY WITH ME and HOT LEGS, and controversial DA YA THINK I'M SEXY. A very fine interpreter given the right material, ROD takes on THE STONES' STREET FIGHTING MAN, SAM COOKE's TWISTING THE NIGHT AWAY and the honky tonk standard WHAT'S MADE MILWAUKEE FAMOUS (HAS MADE A LOSER OUT OF ME) with equal finesse; in fact, his last two chart singles at the time were MOTOWN oldie THIS OLD HEART OF MINE (in a duet with RONALD ISLEY) and an earnest, definitive reading of TOM WAITS' DOWNTOWN TRAIN. While far from perfect (LOVE TOUCH anyone?), at over sixty tracks, STORYTELLERS proves to be an in-depth, fun packed collection.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR CROAKS
B00000FC5H|5.0|Classic Album with All the great hits this Group produced. Great quality sound reproduction. Would recommend this album to all fans.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I went from a pair of wireless gaming headset(Logitech G930) to these as I was having a few issues with the USB headset working with a few games.  The sound difference was noticeable right away.  They are comfortable, though they seem to be a bit smaller cups I'm used to, or I have above average sized ears.  My only minor gripe is I don't care for the coiled cord but it's not enough of a hinderance in what I use it for to really complain.
B0034G4P80|5.0|\\"We fell into human myth and legend...\\" Snorri Sturluson would have enjoyed this movie! I didn't know what to expect - what a great surprise! Director Kenneth Branagh brings depth to the writers story, and Natalie Portman adds a classy element. She quotes Arthur C. Clarke, that \\"Magic is just science we don't understand yet.\\" And Science Fiction is a precursor to Science-fact. Of course Chris Hemsworth (excellent in [[ASIN:B002PMPTIO Star Trek]]) is perfect, but a real treat is Stellan Skarsgård as scientist Erik Selvig, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin (plus ravens). Erik might laugh at the thought that Thor claims the old stories are true, but after the two have a few boilermakers, Thor carries him home, saying \\"We drank, we fought, he made his ancestors proud.\\" Try Iron Man, Iron Man 3 first, and then follow this fun film with another ride, Avengers. We're looking forward to the sequel. Enjoy!
B009MO5960|4.0|Zombie lovers should buy it however, i would say Ep1-2 are more reasonable and based on game.<br /><br />Anyway love Zombie movie
B008JFUO72|4.0|Shane Black is one of the best screenwriters out there, and he comes roaring back with this extremely entertaining [[ASIN:B00EB6F1TY Iron Man 3]]. My expectations were low after the disappointment of Iron Man 2. The only misstep is the unnecessary pejorative use of the p word to a young child (&#34;liked you in the Christmas Story,&#34; hilariously quips Stark to another kid). Robert Downey Jr., brings depth and humanity to Tony Stark, decisively portraying Stark's Asperger's intelligence, unwillingness to have objects handed to him, and cutting remarks. Wonderful ending, surprising his young friend. The best of the trilogy. Enjoy!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Recommend to watch it and the graphic is auesome. Excited movie and fun<br /><br />please go for Bluray disc you will see nice movie
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|This film again features a marvelous team, who succeed in style and attitude. We even like the round ice-cubes in the whiskey. It's clever to weave in Section 31, from Deep Space Nine and Enterprise. As we have seen, Chris Pine is perfectly Kirk. Spock (Zachary Pinto) not only displays \\"multiple attitudes simultaneously,\\" we get to witness him releasing pent-up Vulcan savagery - beautifully executed. Benedict Cumberbatch is spooky in Khan's otherness, voice both fire and ice, and his threat \\"You should have let me sleep\\" worthy of Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n. It would have been a treat if the writers had trusted their capacity to build upon the narrative strengths of their first outing - like the Spock(s) discovering Khan deep within subterranean caverns (a special Trek term) on a planet intended to be a new Vulcan colony. Sad to see Pike (the great Bruce Greenwood) killed, super to see Trek fan/actor/historian Peter Weller have another trip in the Trek-verse. \\"Five years in space, God help me,\\" says Bones (the great Karl Urban). We don't want to have to wait that long for the next installment. Enjoy!
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Not kind of my style and my expectation of this move. I hope it should be the same as lord of the ring
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, but after enjoying Thor and Iron Man 3, had to give this a try. This is a rollicking ride! All I can say is you have to check out his ABC television series \\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,\\" where Joss Whedan finally gives us nerds our flying car in the gorgeous form of Lola, a classic red Corvette. The ACDC music is perfection, and when Stark is told he needs a plan of attack, his reply is perfection, \\"I have a plan: ATTACK.\\" What a great ensemble cast, from [[ASIN:B005H9B44A Thor]] alum Stellan Skarsgård and Jeremy Renner (superb in award-winning film [[ASIN:B0030MKGKY The Hurt Locker]]), to Harry Dean Stanton, who greets The Hulk with, \\"Are you an alien?\\" \\"No\\" answers Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk. \\"Well son, you've got a condition.\\" Great scene when The Hulk whacks the pretentious Loki around. He has anger issues. Whedan takes us on an explosive journey, pushing the boundaries of the cinematic experience. He clearly is influenced by the classic British \\"Doctor Who,\\" with UNIT and the TARDIS, etc, but takes everything to the next level. When Iron Man ascends up to another dimension, and then falls back to earth, we are with him all the way. Enjoy!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|This is the best US series that I ever seen. I love it watch 2 times from Bluray and TV
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Where does consciousness end and a conscious begin? This film is both highly entertaining and yet goes deep with such questions; a wonderful surprise - I didn't know it would be this excellent. The marvelous cast help make the story all the more believable. Andy Serkis is remarkable, emoting from within to create a superb character, and John Lithgow is poignant as the father of a scientist (James Franco) dedicated to discovering gene therapy for his father, who is losing his memory to Alzheimer's. Writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver lovingly integrate elements from past films, and the narrative is beautifully brought to life by director Rupert Wyatt. The pleasure of being a chimp swinging in the redwoods is vividly depicted. A fine film, we hope there is a sequel!
B0009P42S2|5.0|I actually loved this movie. As an animated movie. Not an Anime. Yes there is a difference. You want an animated movie look up Disney. You want an Anime don't watch this.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love cats. I have one. The colors are dark orange black and white. My cat is named Scarlet. She is really sweet. She has claws so she can scratch. She meows. But if she is hungry are thirsty are being hurt she meows. She has alot of toys. Her fur is really soft.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Maybe nobody noticed, but all characters and story lines end up pretty much in the same up and down flowflow. Either all characters I care about either go up or all go down, and usually all at the same time. One in the dungeon, one blinded, one in a pickle, etc. It gets predictable and somewhat boring after a while. Seen better books, but a neat read anyhow. It keeps one occupied and happy as long as one doesn't make the mistake to get into thinking mode too much. So as long as the reader can be content to happily drift along, it is a nice enough read.
B00425S1H8|4.0|I used this on a MacBook Pro so I could console to a Cisco 2690 switch.  I used ZTerm with it, and it worked flawlessly.  I really appreciated the length of the adaptor.  Combined with the serial console cable, it was long enough to reach high up on the racks w/o straining the USB port on my laptop.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|good game. can be addicting. I will get more games from G5!<br />love the hidden object scenes they are just long enough!
1439170045|5.0|i ordered Still Alice because i work with persons with dementia and Alzhiemer's disease. it is very well done, comfortable to read and insightful. fact or fiction, it is enlightening to imagine what is going on inside a deteriorating mind. the husband of one of my clients reports that his wife recently said to him &#34;Are you the one who gives me my medicine everyday? Please keep giving it to me and never leave me, OK?&#34;  the struggle with connecting then disconnecting must be as torturing as the struggle with being recognized then forgotten. i have my own personal copy and ordered these two to share with family members of those with whom i work. i hear positive reports from them as well. i highly recommended this book for anyone concerned with this debilitating disease.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold is one of my favorite authors.  Also one of the few who can make me laugh.  :)  (see she already won).This is the only novel that I remember that gives Ivan a point of view which I have greatly enjoyed reading.  Seeing Simon again was lovely.  And Tej is a delightful addition to the family.  A bit jarring to see Ivan referred to as Ivan Xav the whole book.  I want to see more of that them haut lady.. And I have a wish that Bujold would write about the occupation.  All the hints she drops are maddeningly provocative.  Eagerly waiting for the next installment.
159463176X|5.0|Loved this book because it immersed me into another part of the world I've never had much knowledge about. The universal symbols and meanings about people, struggles, and family longevity are applicable to everyone.
B000001C6M|2.0|Poor production. Very 80's. Very raw. The bottom line is if you love Slayer you have to have this because this is where it all began.
B006022HK8|5.0|going to see k. u. in concert next month...can't wait...did not find any song unlikable! probably will order the new &#34;fuse&#34;  album next.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This Seiko 5 is working great!  After wearing it for a week, it's still within fifteen seconds of the correct time, which is sensational for a mechanical watch.  At only 37mm in diameter, the watch is a little small by 2013 standards, but it's still masculine looking.  The nylon strap is very comfortable, and easily adjusted if the band feels a little too tight or too loose.  The luminescence on the dial isn't brilliant, by it's visible through the night.  My only complaint is that luminescent hour markers are all exactly the same size and shape, so it's a little difficult to orient the watch face for reading in the dark.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Our Kindles were getting hot while recharging and doing crazy things when we would open games. I reported that and Amazon was kind enough to send us updated cords and charger boxes. But these two items get sooo hot you can hardly touch the charger box. So somethingn still isn't right. Amazon had great and generous intentions, the the charger box is scary. Thanks anyway. There must be a solution.
0547572298|1.0|the blade runner film was named after a line from w s burroughs about a drug runner in usa times so why is it in the title of a film by titanic man. dont know. why prepare
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There is nothing as sexy as a smart man with a sense of humor.  This big fat book was well written, well edited and honest.  It's nice to see a writer who doesn't beat you to death with his politics while purporting to tell a story.  As far as I'm concerned, it was one of  the scariest of his books because so much of it deals with human nature.  His writing is as smooth as velvet.  He writes like Nat King Cole sings -  sweet and smooth, and dark, so dark.  PB
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a nice game and anyone of any age can play it. It is a wonderful sand very interesting game with lots of twist in it. I play it whenever I am bored and I feel excited after playing it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I watched this before the fifth , last season went on Amc ,on my iMac thru Netflix and it just reaches out and grabs you by the collar pretty much from the very start. Yes I have seen the Sopranos , great, but  not like this. If there any missteps they are hard to spot, and or unimportant. Bryan Cranston , Aaron Paul in particular give two of the best performances you will ever see, the whole cast is terrific . The writing will go down as being among the top in the business. You can't help but become invested in these characters, and surprised by them , no matter what they do  though you never lose sight of what Walt and Jesse once were and what they have been to each other. There are many edge of your seat moments, get ready, don't miss this , it was quite a ride.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|Lots of bad movies, in my opinion,  in this genre. This is one of the best. Its a perfect blend of story, acting and music. A new twist is added in this movie, astral projection, being able to move outside your body. I find it fitting that Barbara Hersey is in this movie. She starred in one of the best horror movies I've seen, The Entity. This has to be one of the top 5 haunted house/possession movies made. Highly recommend.
B009LDD54K|5.0|cant wait to see this since i have not yet waitched any of the series before although i do have 1 and 2 series
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Extreamly well written. Most of the incedents you have heard about but as presented here in much more detail. It is a good thing we did not know the details at the time. Amazing that our government could screw up so much. Unfortunatly little is said about similar situations in the USSR.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Leaves you with moments of excitement, happiness, sadness, and grief. Definitely is a book worth reading and a man worth dreaming about.
B000FC0OOU|3.0|I did not care much for the story.  It was before my time so I have no connection to the events. The big looser for me was the writing style. It was probably a well accepted style at the time but just does not fit in today. Hemingway changed his style several times in his life and this is just an example of a style that went astray.<br /><br />I enjoyed &#34;The old man and the sea&#34; which was written quite differenty. The fact that there was only one person involved made a difference.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I'll give this app half the first star its so terrible,Who ever made this  App bogus asl..it don't work ik ain't nun wrong with my internet or kindle
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun but solved entire game of ten levels in one day. They should have made more levels to begin with so it could be an addictive game worth day after day of time and tablet space!
1616550414|5.0|The price is awesome! My daughter will love this gift. She has been looking for this book for awhile and is a huge Zelda fan.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|The second book in the Ender Quintet is completely different than the first, and much more focused on psychological and  and philosophical discussions as the main character deals with a troubled family, encounters with new sentient species and his own troubled history. It is a much slower book, but if you give it a try you'll start to like it. Which is kind of sad, as it ends without a conclusion and makes you read the next book, and book 3 is a lot worse. So beware, you may like the story and be tempted to continue reading the series, and as with me, you may discover that sometimes is better to left some stories unfinished.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Don't buy this game if you have a Fire HD until they fix the networking pdoblems.  Bug outstanding since January 2013 and has not been asigned as of October.  Bug tracker MCPE-1134
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a stand alone book that later became the first of a quintet. It has an original and interesting story, fluid writing, interesting characters. It does not answers all the questions that it proposes, as the story is mostly told by the point of view of the main character, but that is not a problem, as you will discover more about the world as the story develops. There are little flaws in this book, and none that prevents me from giving it a 5-star rating and recommending it to any sci-fi  fan.<br /><br />But... Don't fall for the other books in the series. They are completely different from Ender's Game, and may disappoint a lot of readers (myself included). Since the idea of writing other books in the same universe and with the same characters came later, you can really stop at the first and still get a satisfying ending.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had heard the buzz but figured there was some hype involved.<br /><br />Nope, it's real!<br /><br />This guy managed to write a page turner chapter-by-chapter, such that I couldn't put the book down and didn't want it to end.<br /><br />Strong premise, powerful female protagonist, good \\"bad\\" guy, extremely creative setting that generates its own drama, this book is everything you heard about it and more.<br /><br />I just downloaded the sequel as I can't wait to immerse myself back in this unique silo world.
B00D28TNT6|5.0|I've been listening to these guys for a couple of years now and like I mentioned above, they're making great music each time they release a new cd or ep.
B00DHHWY9I|1.0|This is a muddled mashup of spinning visuals meant to enthrall the IMAX 3D audience, and hopefully to make the viewer realize that there is less than 20 minutes of story in this 2.5 hour train wreck. While many films fail to live up to their stellar novels, others like this one fail even to sink to the squalid level of their printed inspiration. Avoid this trash heap at all costs!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake Shelton is in his prime on this CD evoking different types of themes; this CD is a keeper for sure!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great movies (at least the original trilogy)!. I love that it's finally out on Bluray.. I only wish they released the original films &#34;un-Special Editioned&#34;
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|World music at its best done by many musicians with different and unique instruments from all over the world! Excellent!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Very intense.  Not like the book but very good on it's own.  It is so different it is like another chapter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game and I can see my son having fun finding the clues and solving the puzzles.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really liked  the stury of Love over coming the odds. And romance is not bad either! I was kind surprised.
1250038820|5.0|Brandon Stanton has become famous for his project, HONY. I preordered the book as soon as I found out about it. I'm glad to say it meets all expectations, holding the book reassures you it will stay in good condition, it feels lovely in the hand and each page pops with vibrant colors of our every day New Yorker.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is quite interesting and fun.  It keeps me quite engaged with all the games.<br /><br />I hope that it continues to be a bit more than one of fun with all of the power of the game and mystery.
B00ET9T2WK|4.0|This is a great game and I would have rated it five of five stars, but it occasionally stops and returns me to the menu of my kindle fire. Everything saves, mind you, and other than that five of five stars for sure! It's a great turn based war game.
B008MM9630|4.0|I am having a lot of fun with this game.  I am a little bit afraid that I will get carried away with wanting to be really engrossed with this game.<br /><br />In the meantime I will simply have fun.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|PROS:<br />- Graphics are gorgeous and smooth. The scrolling camera with subtle angle changes is amazing<br />- Awesome flavor. The game gives you a great story with almost zero text or dialogue<br />- Gameplay: A surprising amount of skill and creativity are required for a game with only two simple controls. As the game goes on, you learn to use both controls in new ways to travel the levels.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Balance: You can earn coins in the game, but there are only 3 items you can purchase, all almost entirely useless, and all extremely cheap. There should be some more things you can purchase or unlock, or increase the price and utility of the existing items.
B007SVPZMW|1.0|There's nothing special about this game. Tic Tac Toe has got to be the most boring, mindless game ever, and to call this one 'terrific' is misleading. Another misleading statement is that it is somehow high def. Come on, it looks like any other basic game. I also reject any game when I see the developer, employee, or family member posting Five Star reviews about their own product.
