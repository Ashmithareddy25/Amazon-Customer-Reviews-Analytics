B00G9B1MEM|5.0|It is so worth the money. You try to get monsters to get bigger and you unlock the monsters during the game if you have enough clay. Clay is really easy to get and doesn't require real money. You can buy new monsters with your clay that you have at the end of each game. Try to buy all of the hills!<br />  At the end of each hill, or turn, you try to flick the bully,or big, monster as for as you can. This depends on how much clay you have. Every time you flick a monster your distance adds up so you can get a special upgrade called a power play.<br />  At the beginning of each game they give you a goal you want to complete. If you complete all of the goals you beat the bully beast, but still get to play that hill. Very engaging.<br />  There is even another part to each hill, where you can choose if you want to do the cupid level. If you do this you try to get a lot of clay while an avalanche is coming. You try to go as far as you can before the avalanche gets you. Then, on the higher level hills they will multiply the amount of clay you got.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!! So awesome the minions are so funny and cute!!! It has great graphics and installs good too
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Extremely disappointed.  I have read most of this author's early novels but none recently.  I remember intricate plots, interesting characters, and tight writing.  The author seems to have moved on to excessive verbiage, overdone reviews about the main characters personal relationships and her cooking expertise.  The plot is thin and almost secondary to main character's angst about her personal and professional lives.  Very little \\"meat \\"for a crime novel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and fun and fun it . Is very cool and I love it  so much  and it's free so u could get it
B000M53GM2|5.0|Love the OO7 films and this one does not disappoint.  If you like Bond you will probably like this film.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|Loved this movie, action packed, serious physical fight between actor's that will surprise you!<br />Steamy love scene, a worth seeing movie for sure
B000O5B4C4|5.0|What can you say except WOW!  Thrilling and sexy, what more could you ask for.  It is one of Michael Douglas best and of course Sharon Stone made history with one scene!
B00062IDCO|3.0|Season was good.  Really enjoyed it with the exception of one and a half episodes were unable to play due to a faulty disc. Would have rated a 5 if not for that
B0017MO10U|5.0|I love the entire Stargate series.  This is truly an excellent movie.  Very entertaining, it does not disappoint Stargate fans.
0316055433|5.0|This is the best book I've read in quite a while.  I could hardly put it down.  It does bog down about 2/3 of the way through, but it's worth reading on until the end.
1419837923|4.0|Good exciting film.  It is not a five to me but it is certainly a worthwhile film if you like action films.
0316074314|5.0|Love this book!  I've only read about a quarter of it so far, but it is well written and intriguing.
B004K4IZ54|3.0|Taken from an older film it still does not pack the punch that I like in Sci Fi.  I am sure others will love it, it is a good film.
1451666179|5.0|I love her blog and sent this as a gift to my mom. The author is funny, down to earth, and clever. The book is a series of essays, some of which made me laugh out loud. It was a perfect gift for my mom, who was spending a lot of time in waiting rooms, awaiting diagnosis of an illness. It kept her distracted and entertained
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I read this book every year at Christmas time and I love it every time! It is truly an inspiration to us all.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Hysterical.  Oh my God, I laughed so much I think I scared the people sitting next to me while I hunched over my Kindle, trying to read, breathe and laugh at the same time.  I LOVED the brutally hysterical point of view of the male lead.  He's all at once super-hot, a disgusting pig and a romantic hero and so damn funny I had a hard time reading at parts with tears in my eyes.  The female lead is smart, put-together and not taking any of his B.S.  The male lead is... well, full of B.S.  Their dynamic is hot, argumentative and riveting.  A definite recommend!
B000LTAY1U|4.0|This is a real comfortable and stylish watch. If you don't where it every day you will have to reset it that gets a little old but I really like the watch i would get another!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and I am so glad I did!  Hilariously Flawed Hero falls in love with Girl of His Dreams, messes up and must get her back.  Fantastic!  You will laugh out loud and cheer, hoping for the  Happily Ever After!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Historically accurate portrayal of the struggle to define family in the deep south. It crosses the barriers of race with gripping characters that endure horrific events, yet maintain the spirit and hope of perseverance.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Wow! What a cool story! My husband, daughter and I have all read it. I can't wait to read the next book. This dystopian adventure is a great read for anyone who loves action and mystery. Each chapter leaves you hanging on for the next.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I read all of his books but again he has out done  himself again. It is one of the best books I have read. Thank you to John Grisham!!!!
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|One of the best scores I've heard in recent years, I bought the album for the track London Calling. I wasn't disappointed! If you like movie scores for their drama, you'll love this. How to Train your Dragons is also a great one.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|This book rambles. I should have known when I heard that it took her 10 years to write.  Hard to finish.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|What can I say..... It's poppy and silly but I love it. I guess that I'm a lot younger than my earthly years.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Awsome addicting sci-fi series. If you like xfiles type shows,  check out Torchwood! You wont be disappointed, give it a try!
1451695187|3.0|Compelling story - I still believe he was just in a coma. It fascinates me that this book isn't listed under fiction.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great and fun. Love running around all the different areas and can't wait to see what new and exciting areas they come up with next.
0393343405|3.0|Interesting and, I presume, true story. Too wordy and far too much minutiae of the day. A history afficionado would appreciate the background.<br /><br />Greenblatt is clearly brilliant, just too verbose for my tastes..
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful Christmas music!  If you are feeling tired of the same-old-same old renditions of Christmas songs you will be so uplifted and inspired by this cd.  The arrangements and performances have so much feeling.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put it down once the story got moving. A great tale that is amazingly exciting!I certainly read it in 3 days!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Pendergast remindes me of Sherlock Holmes. As usual he is a master at solving a case...<br />The setting is great..with the Old gold mining town and the beautiful winter snowstorms...<br />Events from the Past do indeed affect the future in this book...Well Done
B0000AQS6R|5.0|One of the funniest Christmas movies, ever!  We watch this movie every year and laugh until our sides hurt! Love it! 🎄🎁🎅
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Horrible waste of time if you are expecting a good story. Should have spent less money on special effects and more on the writer.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book beautiful story and a bone chilling end action adventure I would recommend this to all my friends awesome
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great kids and adults funny, memorable movie. I had to have it for my DVD collection. A great movie for anyone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this book…couldn't put it down.  The characters, the historical background which reached back to slavery made this book great.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is quite a comprehensive, well made note taking app. A bonus would be handwriting recognition like the Galaxy Note series of devices have. I use this daily, and it can take the place of an organizer effectively.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Love this movie. Can watch it over and over again.  Classic.  Reading the book now and its excellent, well written and more obviously more detail than the movie
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A Holiday Classic, nicely packaged, under $10.  Would recommend to anyone for gift giving or adding to your own collection.
B008LXZEYU|1.0|THE WRONG MOVIE<br /><br />This Amazon Instant Video version of this film is the wrong version of the movie i've intended to watch. It was a rearranged &#34;subplot&#34; to the original. Many of the most memorable moments were edited out for jokes that were questionable... Amazon should make this clear on to customers, or fix the mislabeled movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved it it is a lot of fun and I like the colours<br /> The best ever  Christmas game you will like it to
B000DJBEXA|5.0|This very well recorded disc from 2004 was bought simply as a response to hearing the small samples from tracks on Amazon. In particular I was struck by the beauty of the opening to the Fantaisie, almost like sounds from another world, and which sounded unlike any other Schubert that I had ever heard.<br /><br />That early promise has been amply fulfilled as indeed the introduction and ending of that Fantaisie really does inhabit a world apart, of half lights and tones and is wonderfully caught by Faust and Melnikov. The remainder of the four movements clearly demonstrate Schubert's quality as a composer in an area of composition, for solo violin, that is relatively rare in his output. In general terms this work is a sunny piece as is the great majority of the remaining two pieces. Although a late work, it does not contain those darker moments so often to be found in the late quartets or piano sonatas.<br /><br />The concluding Rondo brillant in two movements, andante and allegro, is exactly what it suggests and is an enjoyable salon piece of considerable technical challenge. This is an earlier work being written some ten years before and makes an excellent encore item which is now this disc concludes.<br /><br />The sonata, while being more weighty in terms of the two outer movements than the Fantaisie, is still an optimistic work overall. The scherzo presto is a tour de force and the following andantino is an example of typical Schubert lyricism.<br /><br />All of these pieces are relatively rarely played and have come to my notice by chance at a late stage in my collecting days. It only goes to illustrate that there is no end to the voyage of discovery and there are always unexpected treats to be found in unexpected places. it just requires an open mind.<br /><br />I therefore confidently suggest that this disc is really worth investigating and that it offers some lovely music played with the greatest empathy and skill. Well worth considering as a purchase.
B001TH16DI|5.0|nice im only need the next generation movies to completed and im planning to get yhis week actually!!! lml, :) ,lml
B00AYF5SRG|5.0|This very well recorded disc from 2012 presents another five violin concertos to add to Carmignola's growing list of recorded Vivaldi concertos. In this case there are two concertos which are presented in their original form, one that is a premier recording plus two others. All of the concertos come from Vivaldi's last stage as a composer when he was further extending his range of expression and the means with which to achieve those.<br /><br />Vivaldi was, like other composers of his time and as witnessed in the works of Bach and Handel for example, quite open to the idea of adapting previous compositions in order to fit with new performing circumstances or to create extra income. The first two concertos are thus important in so far as they go back to the original manuscripts and otherwise familiar concertos may therefore seem slightly less familiar according to whichever version is known to the listener.<br /><br />The premier recording applies to the third concerto on the disc, RV 283. Carmignola's point here, made in his booklet article, is that the pyrotechnics of the outer movements of this work, as with others, makes the imaginative quality of the slow movements even more notable.<br /><br />The final two concertos conclude with RV 243 known as the concerto without the 'e' string. This does not mean that high notes are avoided but that they are achieved with high positions on the lower strings thus creating a totally different tonal effect.<br /><br />All of these concertos have plenty of interest to occupy the listener and the accompanying booklet supplies much information not included here. The playing of Carmignola and his colleagues is beyond criticism as to be expected and one can only suggest that, once again, here is another example of the players' and the composer's art combined which makes the disc another most attractive purchase prospect
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is by far the standard for android file exploring. I have been using android products for years and ESFP is the way to go
B0049J0DC8|5.0|My granddaughter, who is 3 years old, can't wait to come to Grandma's house and watch &#34;Toy Story&#34; on my Kindle Fire. She's very intent on watching the characters and letting me know what is happening. She's so excited that the characters are right in front of her and knows all their names.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|One of the greatest stories in the English language; with a moral that it is never too late to start over!
0307155102|5.0|In as much as Richard should have changed his last name before publishing children's books, this effort is typical of his quality and learning-based writings and pictures.  So glad to see the edition updated (&#34;Xyphias&#34; is now included as the &#34;X&#34; word to learn.  I got really tired of &#34;Xylophone&#34; being the only &#34;X&#34; word).<br /><br />The pictures and learning tools are endless.  Don't be &#34;Scared&#34; of buying this book.
0385344333|5.0|Love Lee Child, and every one of his books.  He's always on my Pre-Order list, can't wait for his next offering. His Jack Reacher character is without peer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it.  This was an excellent book that I think a lot of people should read.  John Green does an amazing job of capturing the uncertainty of illness along with the hope and challenges of young love.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Never saw this when it came out.  Interesting take on history. The fear generated by a plague during those times was very palpable.
B0061S073A|1.0|this app does not work. If you do not play a video or game through the app the time limits do not work our son figured out rather quickly how to get around the parental controls. What a joke
B005HEFB6M|5.0|It is so great to be able to re-live this series from the beginning, and with NO commercials.  It was a great series.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I got this on sale for the price of two movies.  I have only watched the two films that I cared for from this set: Alien and Aliens.  The transfer to Blu-Ray for both of these films is spectacular.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It is very helpful for understanding amazon's Kindle program. I followed the advice and easily uploaded my book correctly. I recommend this book for the people who want to build his book for Kindle.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I gave it 5 stars, because, as usual Patricia Cornwell delivers a great, full of interesting twists, book. She uses very detailed information, and we have a lot more information on Dr. Kay Scarpetta's niece, Lucy.  Also we actually visit the mother and Dorothy.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Channing Tatum is awesome! Channing is an excellent dancer.  I watch this movie over and over again. Entertaining movie for adults.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a great writer.  Love all his books.  Once you start his books, one can't put them down!  Have many of them.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes does an excellent performance as Temple Grandin. A very moving and entertaining movie. Highly recommended for all to see.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Totally shifted my worldview. Couldn't have been more fascinating. I never write reviews but I can't recommend this highly enough.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it. Action packed, intrigue, mystery, comedic and a little romance. A gripping fast read with a few unexpected twists.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|It was new, in good shape.  I enjoyed the warmth of the story on a cold winter day.  Well done.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a love/hate relationship, lol! The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is bc I can't access the accumulated boosters when playing on Kindle, which bites! Only complaint.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book was very long and kind of predictable. Took me awhile to read this one and it started off slow for me. It didn't really pick up until the games began. I like The Hunger Games better.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|Great great app. My 4 year old loved it. The colors are vibrant and it's loads of fun. Good for long car trips.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|It was a silly. Book. Maybe this is where it wants the fifteen words so I will add another few to see if it goes this time.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|I am very happy with the quality of your product.  Amazon is my primary shopping site. I am impressed with the ease in ordering, the updated information, the follow-up, the tracking, and the timely manner my order was received.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Absolutely Breathtaking!!!! Captivates me every time I listen to her music. How talented and beautiful this is, truly a gift from God.
0515153656|5.0|This is the first Lee Child book I've read even though I have purchased a few.  When I mention the name Lee Child to others, I get enthusiastic recommendations.  I can see why.  Although the plot is outlandish, and I can't understand how the main character Jack Reacher gets away with doing the things he does scot free, it still makes for a good story if you like a good shoot 'em up.  I was surprised until the very end at the number of good guys who actually turned out to be bad guys.  And Child has a real knack for making a love scene titillating without making it pornographic.  I really thought he did a great job in this regard.  He used few words, none vulgar, but he really got me into it.  I am looking forward to reading more and learning more about Mr. Reacher.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Fantastic. Well written as usual by Grisham. Will definitely hold your interest. Practically impossible<br />to figure this one out. A winner.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I am completely addicted!  Although very violent, the violence is appropriate considering the time period. The scenery, especially the waterfalls, is absolutely breathtaking. I love the strong roles women play in this show as well. I'm definitely looking forward to Season 2 in 2014!
B002MG2ATY|5.0|thought-provoking and highly detailed.  There are many things which Garrison (Costner) mentions throughout the movie which are factual accounts, scenarios and events--blended with curiosities and questions.  After watching this movie (or while watching it), do a YT search for and watch &#34;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&#34;, a 9-part series from 1988.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is the best because it's really fun to upgrade vehicles and get new terrains.<br />If you like racing games you will definitely like this game.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Foo Fighter's Dave Grohl on drums and garage style rock just overwhelm in this Opus of greatness from Holmes and company.
B00BY7NK96|4.0|Thank you Sheryl for taking the time in a very busy life to articulate many of the issues that face women in the workforce. I have been a successful chief executive with over 30 years of experience (as well as rearing 3 daughters on my own) and can relate to many of the challenges you talk about. I also now see my daughters struggling with child care, work/life issues and co-sharing of home chores. I believe we still have a long way to go. We women need to take up the challenge and support our fellow females (not at the detriment of men though) to ensure that we progress equality and fairness in all aspects of our lives.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is British acting at its best ever. Most enjoyable series which makes you want it to last for hours. Acting is stellar. Have been watching the series from its beginning and gets better each season .
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Couldn't ask for more in a memory / space utility. I especially appreciate the quick to use app uninstaller and running process shutdown that quickly frees up space an instantly (on my last run) freed up over 200 mb of memory
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Love it!!!! A book with a purple cover is usually great, but this takes the cake .I love it so much.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|It reminds me of a really sad story but it gets better but even though it's better you feel bad but then you snap out of it and are happy again.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I have been playing on my kindle fire, and now it said that it needs to up date but there is no update.  Now it won't let me play at all.  Some one please fix this.  I don't want to uninstall the game but I will if I can't play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am a fan of the game candy crush. I was so happy that I could have been trying to start the game;but I was not.
B00GIXXPHI|5.0|Best movie ever!  Just as good the tenth time as the first.  Beautiful singing and scenery.  Great story.  It's timeless.
6305922756|5.0|Classic rock parody of all time.  My favorite track is Big Bottom obviously making fun of AC\DC's Big Balls.  This would probably be in my top 20 films of all time.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a great game but you really have to watch what you spend your money on I can't wait for the new battling update though it  Will be epic
B000SE5BLG|5.0|This is one of Sabbath's best albums.  Standout tracks are Sweet Leaf and Children of the Grave, but the album is good from start to finish.  It is also listed in Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time.
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|Really loved this movie and singing the songs with my niece wanted to get the songs for the car and this is a great set. Fun extras and you get the MP3s as well as the disk. You should know the MP3 rip comes with additional karaoke songs not on the disks.
B000SJ5XF0|5.0|Another essential piece of 70's rock.  Having sold over 23 million copies in the U.S. it is among a very few artist to achieve the feat of having one album sell over 20 million.  The album is good from start to finish.  I wonder if I even need to say Stairway to Heaven is on it!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This is a thought provoking and yes powerful movie.  It shows how a person under the influence of a powerful mix of drugs can sometimes appear to function normally, do amazing things and even perform very complex tasks.  In some ways it sends the wrong message.
B000IV71E4|5.0|Great Beatles album.  It has the hits Can't Buy Me Love, And I Love Her, I Should Have Known Better and of course the title track.  It should be in any Beatle's fan collection.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|If you like James Bond type movies, this one should be added to your collection.  There is plenty of action and adventure.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Worse Superman movie ever! They should have just made a movie about Krypton and Jor-El because the beginning of the movie was promising.  But, once it switched to Earth and Superman, it was just bad.  IMO Henry is miscast; hairy and disheveled and I was highly distracted by his short overly bulked arms which he couldn't even put down by his sides; he looked like a roid-raged tool and the CGI was comical at times. I even disliked Amy Adams in this. I was actually rooting for the bad guys, at least they had some personality. On a scale from 1-10, Superman is a 10 amongst super heroes, this movie makes him look like a douchey 2.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|I watched this movie many years ago and again just now.  Loved it then, still love it.  It fully deserves all of its academy awards.
B00F2362IE|1.0|bought for my 5 year old grandson.  Slow, slow, slow to load and tended to freeze up.  Hard for an impatient 5 year old to handle!
0142418471|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed how the character development intermixed with plot. The idea of two authors writing for the perspective of their chosen characters worked well, including how human and yet so inspirational people can turn out to be. Gay and teenage sexuality should not be pathologized, and so I appreciated how real as they shared the characters' inner longings and fears. One last thing: A touching book as twists of vulnerability are faced and conquered.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|There are a lot of sounds, which makes it fairly easy to make your own atmosphere.  I love it.  It helps me to sleep every night.
0956010903|5.0|This is a nice book, a collector's edition, a replica copy of the original one by JK Rowling. I don't read it because I want it to be a nice clean book
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Out of all the games i have had i think this beats all. Now that they have added megaladon, this game is even more awesome.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Even though Twitter completely stabbed all its third-party client partners in the back, this first-party client is really pretty nice and gets  the job done.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This app was fun and as great as the console version of this game I give this 5 stars for graphics and gameplay.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It won't let me buy it says that I need to go to amazon and do it like that but still nothing
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|its just so fun and addicting that you cant stop but the one little flaw is that u have too pay money after your energy runs out
B002LC8HF0|5.0|One of the best well thought out stories I've read in a long time. Mr. Sanderson is a rare talent.
B00EODUWQ6|3.0|A ripping yarn that would benefit from a good editor!  The storyline takes current social media to its logical conclusion, creating a dystopia.
B00DHPN7G4|5.0|These shocks, which increase resistance on the analog stick, help your aim immensely as they help you aim smoother and make smaller, less twitchy adjustments on the analog stick. I bought these in preparation for COD Ghosts and I've maintained a 1.2 kd with them. These are great.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Definitely engaging, maybe a little simple, but beautiful graphics and fun story line and game play. And it was free!
B00280LYIC|4.0|I rated this book because it was not entirely clear to what was going on. We knew that they found out it was medusa(Mrs. Em) but we didn't know how they would have guessed. We do know that the satyr knew it was his uncle Ferdinand, but what happened to him.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Great app.  Offers everything you need in word processing, excel spreadsheets and power point presentations.  Offers nearly everything that Microsoft Office has to offer.  Can't beat the price ~ free!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|we can't get past the first item being place on the spot where my grand daughter would like to put it.  It's on age 5, so why is it that its not easy to do if they allow for much younger kids to play it?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is an awesome app I love all of the horses they r all so cute and beautifully graphed out
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|excelente producto
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Great movie!  Believe it or not, it was just as much fun to watch as the first red movie.  If you enjoyed the first one you'll enjoy this one.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I love it !!! Waited a long time to get this cd and have enjoyed it. It's amazing!!! I wish I could sing
B008JGSM6G|5.0|There are many levels from easy to really hard.  The whole family loves it. This is an extremely addictive and fun game to play.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This game keeps me company on long travels and it keeps me focused and makes my ride seem quick.<br />Awesome com and my 4 year old plays as well
B00BC254I8|5.0|This was much more than I expected.  I thought it was going to be more about boxing, a sport I really enjoy. The book is an emotional roller coaster.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome I can't believe it took this long to come to amazon the game is amazing the console version is the best game ever
B001SAO38Q|5.0|What more is there to say! A lovely job presenting this great movie. Some great extras well worth checking out, and Caine at the top of his game.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This is a great book and I think that it is the best way to get a good definition of anything. Link likes this review and so does pokemon and Naruto.LOL. TTYL.  @ Lord™ and the Clone Wars
B006GKHE6G|4.0|I read several reviews stating the controls don't work on the Kindle but it appears the developers have addressed this issue. I had no problems (other than my &#34;mom lack of video game skills&#34;) in playing the game.<br />It is a well-designed racing game. Instead of the typical track, you get to race on water in some very fast boats. I liked the overall designed of the game and the look. You can unlock special boats with better racing abilities. You can also earn achievements for various skills, and can compete in the leaderboard on Game Circle.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care for this sharing of scores since it opens up network sockets that can leave your device open to other files also being downloaded (for example, your personal info and contacts, possibly our passwords), but this particular game does not seem to be set up to do any of that. I did not get any virus messages in the download. However, since I don't like this open exchange, potentially without my permission or knowledge, in the background, I dropped a star.<br /><br />The game itself, though, is very fun. I probably won't play it much since I crash... a lot.... but my sons will love it. They will enjoy competing against each other and trying to get all the achievements completed, while unlocking the boats.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth the FAOTD download.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is my favorite calculator for reconciling check book. Add in the free part and what is not to love.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This ought to come standard on every adult's Kindle. I use it on my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, my third Kindle, and it's made my Kindle cross the line from book to computer. I use Excel a lot and this app just works: multiple sheets, formulas, fonts, sizing of columns. It also saves to the Cloud automatically. I use Dropbox so I share between Kindle-Phone-Computer automatically. I've been reluctant to try Office alternatives as I've paid for others before on my phone that I really never use. The size of the Kindle screen and the smart menu management of this app work. Even if other Office apps have let you down, try this one.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Dawkins begins by saying that this is the book he never expected to have to write and, frankly, it is also the book that you should never have had to read; all that having been said, READ IT!
B000OVLINI|3.0|This book was recommended to me by an enthusiastic fan as being extremely well written with an excellent plot so perhaps I expected too much.  It's good.  I liked the characters.  But it was a bit too melodramatic.  The writing is solid but it did not evoke the emotion that I have experienced with other writers such as Dickens, Herman Koch, or Jonathan Safron Foer.  Although the book is set in the mid 40s to 50s, I found some of the language too contemporary.  Though perhaps this is the fault of the translator and not the author.  For example in 1945 he uses the word &#34;nymphet&#34; which was a word introduced in the 50s by the book Lolita.  Overall - fun read but not one I would recommend to my more critical friends.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. About time to watch it again. It's an old fashioned romance where people you think wouldn't come together do - eventually. Time for a pot of tea, a warm afghan, and to curl up and watch this movie.
B00BU1DH1M|4.0|Standing in Another Man's Grave was a little too picaresque and didn't quite convince - perhaps Rebus doesn't function well outside Edinburgh?  But this is much more like it, with two apparently distinct cases - one new, one ancient - being brought inexorably together, against a background of Scottish politics and some interesting shifts in alliances and relationships between the police characters.  It didn't end up where I expected it to, but it's the right place to get to nonetheless.
B00EDLP6O2|2.0|This game is not a very good game. It slows your kindle down and is also a waste of money. I was very upset to find out that this was a waste of my time. I hope you don't make the decision that I made when I got this game.
B00DSO9RMC|3.0|...although he still finds it hard to turn a dull sentence.  Rather too much Yorkshire bluster (what has Yorkshire to do with the railways? Stephenson was a Geordie) which gets a bit wearing.  But a handy conspectus of railway lore with enough references to classic railway stories and films to keep you engrossed.
1250038820|5.0|A fascinating glimpse into people's minds, coupled with artistic, soulful shots that bring their personalities and stories to life. Love.<br /><br />What would you say/do?
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The book is of high quality for both story and writing skills.  It is thought provoking and stimulating reading.  Perfect for book clubs. It is another gem by Grisham who has to be among the best writers of our time.  He develops the story with precision and makes his characters as authentic and believable as can be done.  Sycamore Row flows along nicely as the story takes on shape and direction.  The flow slows a bit in the middle,  but it's not long before the flow picks up speed. It roars as it carries us toward the end with white water speed and revelations providing answers that have eluded discovery for many years.  Another Grisham great!
B007TK77QE|5.0|Great book, so much going on with so many people in the village. Could not put it down. Recommend it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyable book that had some surprises for me that I didn't see coming.  Not just a shallow follow through from the first book.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|ok it sounds fun but I can't play the app since it keeps freezing! I first installed it and waited patiently but it was taking forever. So then I installed it a second time and it still won't work. I have a kindle fire...Maybe that's the reason? I really don't know :(
B004UJAOLM|4.0|It is widely considered that this novel is difficult to understand because of multiple characters having similar names and the use of several narrators in the telling of the story. I found the immersion reading to be very helpful in keeping things straight and I highly recommend it.
B006BQM762|5.0|first class entertainment. It is, of course, an idealized look at the way kids act, but Spielberg provides the payoff when it's required...
B00FHAB3HW|4.0|It took a couple of listens for this to grow on me but now I don't want to take it out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Made me think about how this world is and how this is possible . What a good series . Highly recommend.
B00EPVTLKU|2.0|I really wanted to like this because she has a beautiful voice but the more I listen the more I feel as though the album is full of songs written for Mariah that weren't good enough for her to record. Buy the singles unless the album is on sale.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Definitely mommy porn, it's really pretty dirty... This is normally a book I'd read in the bathtub, but the writing was soooooo awful I could scream. I finished it of course because I love to read but it was painful. I have not read the other books
B00A0HQ7H8|2.0|I love her voice but I just can't get into her music; I find it boring and start tuning it out.
B00G3HSF7O|3.0|I liked the movie but I will say I will never look to watch it again. So for Sci-Fi movies that's bad for me. I've seen Aliens, Terminator 1,2 and 3 and The Fifth Element, just to name a few, dozens of times and I still enjoy them. There was enough action to keep me going but the moment you start trying to put logic into it everything falls apart. The plot was filled with huge gaping holes.Some scenes only worked independently as if they forgot the parameters of the the plot.... What's with all the comments about this movie being liberal and left? That's all you can say? I never ever thought that, one way or the other. It's a movie, that's all and it's just ok. Wait until you can rent it for $4.99
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|At last, the long awaited album from Boston. Its great to hear from these guys again. Although its not on the same level of their first two albums, Life, Love & Hope is still a good listen, and most fans will want a copy. If only Tom Scholz had written a few more new songs... This album seems to be missing the passion and love for writing songs that once captured all of our hearts and ears!  Nevertheless, I suggest making a few changes to the song order:<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />-Heaven On Earth<br />-Last Day of School<br />-Someday<br />-The Way You Look Tonight<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />-Life, Love & Hope<br />-If You Were In Love<br />-I Think I Fell in Love with You (Tommy DeCarlo)<br />-Love Got Away
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|This was great, good character bits, lots of fun.  Everyone had some talent and showed it.  The idea was fresh and the execution was wonderful....enjoy.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|This gets 1 star for the eye candy, otherwise I'd give 0. I'd rather own a video game than watch one.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|My second time through this, loved the books and the original movies.  This version is certainly worth a watch, if you really like it go watch the originals, they are done in subtitles or dubbed in English.  Read the books, one of the better series written in the last decade.
0767903862|5.0|Another great book by Bill Bryson, many laugh out loud moments.  You won't be disappointed unless you are looking for something mundane. Also, if you want to learn a little about Australia, but don't want to be bored with standard historical text, a great option!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|There are better apps . The horses and items are over charged , and the period of time you have for some quests are unreasonable . It's not like you're going to play 24 HOURS ! My little brother seems to enjoy it ... Well, what can I say ? He's 4 years old ...
0062060554|5.0|This book was a good read. It was one of those I could not put down and finished in less than a week!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|EVERY BIT AS GOOD as part 1 (A Time to Kill)! A compelling story with excellent character development. I'm ready now for the movie?
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Cornwell is spending too much time on Marino and Benton's personalities, conflicts, interagency squabbles, etc.  I love the mystery of her work and the medical examiner detail but Cornwell reads more and more like a romance novel.  I have read all her books and think this evolution in her writing dilutes her talent and makes reading it laborius.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Powerful movie. It has some very graphic parts. You really get a sense of what they went through. Makes you think
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I love it and I just got the game. That is why I rated Uno 5 stars.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so awesome for many reasons there are awesome fighting robots and awesome arenas go real steel awesome
B008JDAC7G|5.0|A visually appealing game that is fun for anyone to play.  The basic premise seems simple enough, match 3 colored blocks to level up to a single upgraded block.  However, with the physics involved, keeping your building neatly stacked without toppling over becomes a real challenge as you progress.  Not to mention those hungry monsters who can cause carnage if not fed properly.  The achievements will keep the replay value of this game up.<br /><br />However, some of the challenges are difficult to understand how to accomplish, as the tutorial doesn't quite cover some of the higher level combos you can create.  As well, I'm still trying to understand when blocks match and when they don't.  Occasionally, when I have a bronze/silver/gold block in between a group of 3 colors, sometimes they'll match and sometimes they won't.  Hard to determine if they will or not, which can throw off your strategy.<br /><br />Apart from those minor drawbacks, this game is great and definitely deserves 5 stars!
B008JFUPPI|5.0|great movie loved it had lots of action some comedy and great special effects would recomend it for the whole family.
B003WUYOQ6|1.0|I had high expectations that I would learn something new, but I was sadly disappointed. The whole book has one point - carbs are bad. This book doesn't state anything new from all the countless books preaching to not eat carbs. The only difference this book has from other don't-eat-carbs book is that I felt discouraged that I may never lose weight even though I cut out all carbs. That's what this book preaches - that there is a good possibility that even cutting out carbs could mean never, never getting lean. I guess this is could be truth, but the author should really state this at the beginning of the book, instead of teasing the reader for page after endless page about the badness of carbs, thus giving the reader the hope that the author is going to provide a solution alternative to living without carbs. But there is no alternative solution. Just a declaration that we may be doomed to be chubs for forever.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|Interesting, but this is fiction, right??? How could she remember such minute detail from 20 years ago. She never mentioned keeping a journal on that trek.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I chose this book to try a new author, as I have a far and wide reaching collection of books from a small group of writers. Other reader´s reviews of this book looked promising, and I just bought a Kindle fire on black Friday.<br /><br />Every spare moment not engaged in earning a salary or tending to my toddler was spent reading chapters  of this book. I was  entranced and then addicted. By the time by e-reader displayed I was  67% into the book, I plunged into it and finished it that morning.  I couldn't start any other project without the closure that completing this novel provided.<br /><br />This author draws you into the characters she has created and incorporates a level of suspense I haven't experienced in a book in a long time. I experienced an almost anxiety with the build up of \\"not knowing\\" the outcome as chapters progressed. The characters, while dealing with many real life  situations, also have some major problems plaguing them.<br /><br />Although this book is a must-read for ANYONE, I think that anyone who is or who has been a parent might find themselves bawling at the end of the novel, which I most certainly did. Also extremely relevant to anyone who is ever had their heart broken, made a mistake, thought about being young or growing old, or had a secret.......haven't we all? I will soon be purchasing other books by this author.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Dan Brown - can't go wrong with him.  I see reviews all the time where people nit pick - but really - the whole point is just to escape - and that's what his books lets you do!
B009M4KTEM|2.0|If you are a die hard fan of Jerry you might enjoy listening to his  so-so material.<br />This show lacks the lyrical quality that characterizes his best work, and there are scads of better versions out there of any of the tunes covered here.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This was a girl for my boyfriend, he absolutely LOVES it.  Says he can't believe the quality for the price!  Will definitely buy again!
B00DW5IM9Q|3.0|This is worth a few listens, largely to get a sense of Dylan's creative  and technical process.<br />Not many suprises here, and lyrically there is not much to chew on, but fans will appreciate  the fly on the wall view of these recording sessions.<br /> I will end up passing this on to  another Dylan fan for their perusal.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Life of Pi was interesting but not so much that I couldn't put it down. It took me 8 months to finish it. It wasn't the book I picked up to read for fun! I wanted to read it before I see the movie.
B00CCEHR80|3.0|I am afraid that we are beginning to beat a dead horse with Garcia's recorded material.<br />I will pass this off to one of my friends.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I love it! It's a very very good iPhone 5 case that's durable and leather. Definitely worth the price it sells for.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|Excellent read. Pretty interesting aspects have been covered and provide a different perspective. A different book as usual from the author
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Richard Dawkins lives up to his reputation as one of the top atheists battling our modern day Religious beliefs and their contradictions. His approach to the subject using his scientific knowledge is very enjoyable to read, and it feels like he could continue to write like this for years. This is not a short book, and despite this I want more. I would highly recommend this book to anyone even slightly interested. It is an excellent read, whether you're an atheist, agnostic, religious person of faith, or someone with doubts about God. There is plenty of scientific knowledge against the existence of God including Mathematics, and Physics, but Richard stayed within his field of science, thus his input and observations regarding this ongoing debate really shine in this fine work.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was a stroke of genius to make Death the narrator of this story. Since no one knows what Death's perspective on the human race might be, many unique insights are made believable by the author.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A well written story. It is as good as the first volume Garme of Thrones. I lok forward to the third volume.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game.I love playing the game with my God daughter. She is very competitive. So many levels and characters to keep motivated.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|Classic Rick Moranis flick.  The comedic stars are in abundance in this fantastic rendition.  Great vocals and effects.  HD is a refreshing way to view.
B00CQ5R18G|4.0|Smouldering continuation of the Scarpetta series. Revved up to 4th gear slowly, but frustratingly, didn't hit 5th...despite the anticipation of an exciting end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my second time reading this and I just can't get enough if the whole trilogy! I can't wait for the movie
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got a great black Friday deal on the Chromecast from Amazon and it came with $6 Google Play credit.  Set up was very easy, just plug and play, add wifi password, and essentially you are good to go.<br /><br />This was purchased primarily to do what Roku can't, stream Google Play Videos and YouTube, but I was pleased to learn that I can also cast CBS episodes from the Chrome Browser.  Thus far, I have casted from my phone, my wife's phone, and a laptop with no problems.<br /><br />I view this as a must have for cable cutters like myself.  With the added capability of streaming Google Play videos and YouTube combined with Netflix and Amazon Prime from my Roku, I will be able to shop around for best deals on movies and TV episode seasons.  With the ability to take advantage of streaming Play Store movies and episodes, the $29.99 I spent on this should pay itself off rather quickly.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've ordered several items and received them the way I expected. I can find things I need from Amazon and I recommend it to my friends and family.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This is a steal.  You get all the movies and don't have to buy that ridiculous toy box edition or spend 30 bucks on each movie individually.  Why can't they offer this in us stores?  Anyway worth the money.  Works fine on my ps3.  Make sure your bluray player is region free
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is my third time reading this series. Every time I read it, I pick up in details that I had not previously picked up on. A really great series.
0694003611|3.0|The illustrations in this book were disappointing to me. I have many books by Margaret Wise Brown, and I was expecting a similar product. However, this book does have a fun story for students/children.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you will really want to get this game it is fun and really ocupiying it is really cool it has differt worlds and makes sure you know how to play the game
B000SFD21Q|5.0|The author just laid out the evidence and facts of what exercise does for the brain. I've found myself at the gym 4-5 days a week after reading just a few chapter.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the game spider solitaire. With my kindle and this game I have something to do while waiting for an appointment.
B00B9ZCVN4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book though the ending was a bit disappointing as it was somewhat of a deus ex machina (can't say much more without spoiling).<br /><br />That said I am looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
141694737X|5.0|My son LOVES this book....he just turned 4 and he still likes it!  We're using it now as an early reader.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the 5 free games of bingo daily! Also like the free &#34;daily slot&#34;. Very entertaining & a great way to get points
B009Z5975A|1.0|I bought this at a Wal-Mart black Friday special. I've only watched Gremlins 2 so far, but the transfer is horrible. Looks like they just ported the DVD version over with zero clean up. Colors are bland, grain everywhere, sound is terrible and out-of-synch at times. Hope Gremlins and Goonies are better. Love all three of these movies, but so far, this is a blu-ray in name only. HD my ass.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I liked this movie. It was well made. I realize the criticisms, and yes they are legitimate for some reasons, but let me list why this movie is a fine one for those who are on the fence about a rental.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is fun and fine. The tone tends to be a touch solemn, but they have a subtle and fun humor, especially hitting on Superman's more grandiose abilities.<br /><br />The scenes are exquisite. The cinematography and the special effects take you places and show you things that are from the imagination, as they should. Excellent in nearly every way.<br /><br />Russel Crowe (Not singing)<br /><br />An origins story that gives us excellent need for catharsis in the future. It leaves the world open and ready for a story more cunning than &#34;These guys are tough.&#34;<br /><br />Interesting ideas that writers will be able to (hopefully) capitalize on soon.<br /><br />This is a great groundwork for the future, and that is what it was meant to be I feel. I look forward to the next submission and recommend this one as a stepping stone to getting to know the man of steel.
B00EIBO8T6|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of my Christmas favorites. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. There's only one part that is NOT suitable for children.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Love It, love it, love it. Witty, charming, bittersweet and sooo English. A gem. Plan on watching it again very soon.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It was good enough. By halfway through the ending was pretty well figured out. There seemed to be a lot of filler writing.
B00FRBMA8W|5.0|“No Man is An Island and Other Short Stories” by Sonya C. Dodd is a delightful collection of short stories that will take you an emotional and intellectual journey into yourself, your life, and the human condition.<br /><br />Sonya C. Dodd is able to write stories in different genres, on a wide variety of topics, and she does it very well.  The issues she tackles in her stories range from the hardships and miracles of pregnancy  to the bittersweet taste of a forbidden romance to family relationships to journeys into history to clever twists on old classics (“Ophelia” is one of my favorites!).<br /><br />Sonya C. Dodd also writes stories that feel like “The Twilight Zone” episodes, and my two favorites of that genre are “Alone” and “Giant Sentinels.” Whether Ms. Dodd writes a realistic story or clearly a fantasy, her characters are always real, their problems believable, and plots – engaging and exciting. A great collection!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It 6 blue ray discs of nothing but Alien. Definitely a must have for any fan of the franchise. I like that both versions of each film are available.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The building of characters is flawless, with twists and turns it will hold your mind right to the end and leave you pondering
B000RD0RDU|2.0|I bought 4 of these fans to keep my bitcoin mining board cool. So far 2 of the fans got hooked up and they don't spin unless I flick them... once they turn, they'll keep turning.. so if I lose power, I might fry out a few chips :-(<br /><br />Also they don't come with screws. Which wouldn't be an issue for me if they were the same thickness as the fans I previously had. These mounts are thick! So I'm gonna have to go to the local hardware store and buy longer screws.<br /><br />As for rpm, these are not special nor do they have great air movement. I'd actually let a baby play with these while running...<br /><br />They do seem to run quiet when they're on.. so far so that part of the description is accurate
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Great cast.  the beginning was pretty funny but the movie became too predictable.. but a lot of funny parts.  worth the watch.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Love the extended and added scenes. All adds so much more to the film.<br />After watching this one and watched all the Lord of the Rings trilogy extended version.
1451666179|5.0|If you've read Allie Brosh's blog, this is a must have. It's all the best of her in one, wonderfully awkward and heartfelt place.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Fun film and entertaining storyline<br />Enjoyed the film and all the actors.<br />Liked seeing Harrison Ford in another movie Good movie
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Helpful hints on how to keep a conversation going. I tried some of the techniques on teenagers and they responded
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Interesting movie story line.  Enjoyed the movie and looking forward to a<br />follow up film. Enjoyed the pace of the film and seeing Idris Elba performance in<br />another film.Liked the character played by Noomi Rapace. Another great film<br />from Ridley Scott.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I read it to my children so they would know what a real love story should look like and compare it to most of the love stories of today.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Love Johnny Deep enjoyed his performance.<br />Fun and entertaining story line<br />enjoyed the revamp of the story.<br />Film is a good time.
B003W5C0VM|1.0|After finally buying a  copy of the SOME GIRLS concert I figured I may as well get this one too, as I like the set list of LADIES AND GENTLEMEN better. Wow; what a let down compared to SOME GIRLS ! The quality of the audio and video is just awful. I'd call it bootleg quality, but it's not even THAT good. Seriously, this blue ray disc really blows. Save your money, or just get SOME GIRLS and see what a REAL concert video should look and sound like. Even one that is 40 years old. If this is the best that could be done with the original tapes/film, it should never have been released.
B004EPYZTE|4.0|Enjoyed the film and fun seeing Jason Momoa in the lead, as I was familiar with<br />his performances from Stargate the television series.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|The Dvd sent to me was faulty and some segments were not possible to play. My daughter waited a long time for the cd and to her disappointment, her favourite songs like one day more and on my own were spoilt. To be fair, this is the first time I have received faulty items from Amazon though.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Classy puzzle game. Graphics are crisp and music is soothing. Haven't checked yet if there's an option to change the music. Hope so because while it is peaceful the melody keeps repeating and burns into your head for the rest of the day.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm a sixth grade student who has always struggled with enjoying reading, but this was the best book I've ever completely read, cover to cover. Parts made me laugh, and other parts made me get teary eyed. Please read this book. It's wonderful.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|You will not be able to put this one down kids, you will be drawn in to Leisle' s story and her adventures.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|High praise for the writer and the audio reader. I was pulled into the story. LOVED  the characters, they really came to life. The art history was interesting also. Plot twist are unexpected and moving.
B00G3Q6VPS|1.0|Pure disappointment. Easily her worst album to date. They labelled it as her most personal album but it's not a personal album since it wasn't written by her and the songs are generic as hell. Work Bitch has cringe-worthy lyrics which passes messages about prostitution and money but the beat is sick. Perfume is a huge let-down, Britney's only awesome ballad is &#34;Everytime&#34;. &#34;Blackout&#34; remains her best album along with &#34;In the Zone&#34;.<br /><br />Check out: Alien, Work Work, Passenger and that's all.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|I love my crocodile shoes, especially in the winter time, it is comfy, and look so cool on my feet.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|bought it for my grandson ,he really likes it use to watch it when it was on tv ,every chance he got.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|The series misses little details that are very important to the characters of the book eg the swords owned by certain lords.
B00FPH6PRK|4.0|This movie was recommended to me.  However, I thought it is quite typical of horror movies of this day without the nudity.  I did enjoy the movie but, any one of the other horror movies would have sufficed for a bit of entertainment on an otherwise boring evening. I did appreciate, the lack of nudity which is usually unnecessary anyway.​
B004GJXQ20|5.0|This is a book . Intelligence, wit and most importantly characters that have life. They breathe, they love and sadly they die.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have been using Google Search for two years.  It is reliable, though sometimes I wonder it Google can read.  I will say 95% of the time Google Search is quick and accurate.  I would not consider and other search engine than Google Search.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down even though I knew about how it would end but I was surprised.  A 5 stars reading
1419818112|5.0|This movie has been played and replayed so many times, I've lost count!  It is THE favorite of the women in my home.  I can always tell when it has been on because I come home to crying and tears all over the place.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's a good game maybe a little to easy seems to be very easy to beat each level maybe it will get harder the higher the levels
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I don't know how I felt about this book, unusually I'm inspired, happy or heartbroken at the end of a book. This one had me relived. It was like a roller coaster, but most of the time I stayed pissed at Travis and Abby. They were too much and I got annoyed a lot of the time so 4 stars. Plus the story line was ehh. I wish I hadn't wasted 4 dollars on the hype they gave this book.
B008VBSR9G|5.0|Amazing album, i could not wait to finally have it in my collection and jam to it every night! Thanks!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This series is by far the best take on the possible reality of social interactions that would come about if a zombie apocalypse actually occurred. While the effects are awesome. And the zombies and methods of their demise are visually stunning. It is the interactions amongst the survivors that really makes this show worth watching. I've been a fan since the first season, and it continues to get better and better. The writing, direction, and acting are phenomenal! Everyone (including the zombie extras) are obviously &#34;putting their all&#34; into their performances. Even if you are not a fan of zombies or horror, I highly recommend you give it a shot. The drama alone is epic!

B001DCZ4IW|5.0|LOVE this movie.  An all-time classic.  It's a bit of a dark, twisted comedy that addresses the subjects of death, suicide and age.  It tugs at your heart all the way.  Wore out my old copy and had to purchase a new one.  If you haven't seen this wonderful movie, then you are missing a great one.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Factions and alliances go in and out. Still a good game trying to get a hold of game loft to figure it out kills time
0374531269|5.0|Ishmael writes a heart wrenching account of his own experience as a boy soldier in Sierra Leone. While reading this book an important feature stuck out to me - their shoes (or crapes) and Ishmael's hip hop tapes. In the middle of a war, globalization and the global culture touches the smallest villages in Sierra Leone. The roles of females and males in the war couldn't be more different. Only men were on both sides of the war and women were in charge of cooking/cleaning/sexual favors for the soldiers. Ishmael's story affects myself in an emotional way. I feel like I can't help the situation that he faces in any real way. After reading this book Im left with a feeling of helplessness and despair.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Tame is awesome I know people are saying that 505games copied this but obviously 're-Logic doesn't care otherwise they would have sued them for copy right. I think that you should get this game. NOTE: Developer's you need to make it to we're you have more hearts please?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much it's so awesome. If you played this game then you would know how awesome this game is
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|Great game just don't like how you have to buy uru so you can buy flame hammers but overall pretty good
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is very entertaining!! Each level gets more difficult but not so hard ya give up..lol. really enjoyable! love the puzzles!
B00G9IMJ3S|4.0|A bit affected and filled with bitterness.  Sometimes, you wish that they editor would have stepped in.  Still, it is fascinating as it is off-putting.  However, do not get the US edition of this book.  The US Edition is expurgated.  Morrissey's relationship with Jake Walters has been removed from the US Edition? Why? I am not sure.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Don't believe the naysayers.  This is a first-rate cerebral spy movie.  It is not hard to follow as some say, but you need to have a quiet room with no interruptions - like at a movie theater.  The plot is simple - there's a mole in British intelligence (or is there?) and you have to follow the clues.  Top-notch performances all around.  No, it's not Fast and Furious, but something better.  Excellent commentary track by the director and Gary Oldman fills in some details that are referenced but not explained in the time frame of the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham's back!  I was reluctant to get this book since his<br />his past few books were just OK.  This one is great!!
B00GX59QO2|1.0|Disconnected scenes, ridiculous violence.  Didn't make any sense. The first RED was really good, and we were looking forward to seeing this one, but it was stupid.
B00FEN58KA|5.0|I purchased this doll through Disney before the movie came out.  It is beautiful!  But I have 2 granddaughters and so wanted to purchase another.  The Disney store is now sold out and the others being sold through various stores for $12 etc. is not this original.  Those have the painted on, above the waist, clothes. SO BEWARE!  So I bit the bullet and paid the extra through Amazon so both girls will be happy at Christmas.  To be sure, the Disney sticker should be in the upper left hand corner of the packaging.
B00AGYM0DU|4.0|A very interesting book of two parallel stories. One is Nao a Japanese schoolgirl who is contemplating suicide because she is being bullied at school, but a summer spent with her Buddhist nun great grandmother, Jiko, means she wants to write Jiko's life story first. In doing so she tells the story of her life in Tokyo pre 9/11 which is revealed to Ruth, the protagonist of the second story, a woman with writer's block who finds Nao's diary washed up on a beach in remote western Canada. Ruth wants to prevent Nao's suicide but sadly realises she might be too late. With themes of time, and how we use it, the effect of war on individuals, cyber-bullying and the destruction of the environment this is an excellent, modern and highly readable novel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive but fun!  Wish there was a guide about the different levels (I.e.what clears various jelly's).  Good game overall.<br />Seriously?  I'm not going to leave many reviews if I have to type a novel to get it submitted.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Set during the gold rush in the southern part of New Zealand's South Island this is a gripping mystery of mammoth proportions. With a large caste of characters, many escaping from dark and haunted pasts, which are slowly revealed to be intertwined in a myriad of ways, lots of gold to be fought over and much opium to be smoked, there is treachery afoot. When a well liked and rich young man disappears, and a young woman is found unconscious in a remote location in the dead of night by an up and coming politician speculation in the town of Hokitika is rife.
B00CHILW64|4.0|This is an incredible true story of a family in the aftermath of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The special effects are well done and really quite chilling. It is well acted, written and directed. I am, normally, a very critical movie goer so it takes quite alot to get a four star rating from me.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Like th e easy controls. Like the sounds. Love the graphics. The zooms cool. Just started curious to see if it goes faster
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ahhhh, the Chromecast. My sister got me one of these little gems from the first batch that they released. She knows how much a love being an &#34;early adopter&#34;. The Chromecast ROCKS! I know, I know, you're saying &#34;I already have a Roku, so why do I need Chromecast?&#34;. Because I said so, k? It does things that the Roku just can't. You can stream any video, from any device. You have terrific control with the fast forward and rewind functions. It's super portable, you can travel with it. It works great in hotels.It's fun. It's small. It will make you cool.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|This story was extremely captivating; I could not put it down. The author took me on a journey wrought with dark foreboding shadows and anguish. At times it was cyclical; the people seemed to follow the same laid tracks that lead them, as it did those before them, down paths of despair and disappointment. There were  no real moments of joy and happiness. The idea of hope seemed not to be a major part of this story. The story actually proves to be instructional focusing on making right decisions.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|this is the first persona game ive played and i really like it  im probably gonna go back and play the other games too before persona 5 comes out!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game every level a challenge. Should call it candy crush addiction! This game never gets old. 400 levels and counting
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Pearl Jam is an interesting band as they have managed to continually have top 10 albums for 22 years, yet only have 4 top 40 singles to their name. They continue to sell albums, too. However, a quick look at Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Nirvana shows that their contemporaries are still equally just as popular (even Foo Fighters). But, Pearl Jam, it could be argued, has 'outwit, outplayed and outlasted' everyone else. Along the way, you could argue that they have never 'sold out'. They are like Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd or The Grateful Dead--all bands with few hits and monster followings and respectable places in rock and roll history.<br /><br />My opinion about their albums is that they started off strong with &#34;Ten&#34;, &#34;Vs&#34; and &#34;Vitalogy&#34; and then dipped somewhat with &#34;No Code&#34;, &#34;Yield&#34;, &#34;Binaural&#34; and &#34;Riot Act&#34; and then came roaring back with &#34;Pearl Jam&#34;, &#34;Backspacer&#34; and now &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34;.<br /><br />Yes, &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34; is pretty solid from beginning to end with a few exceptions like &#34;Swallowed Whole&#34;, &#34;Let The Records Play&#34; and &#34;Yellow Moon&#34;, but these are small quibbles. You get a trio of rockers to open the album with &#34;Getaway&#34;, &#34;Mind Your Manners&#34; and &#34;My Father's Son&#34; punctuated by the balled &#34;Sirens&#34; which is excellent. Things get rocking again with &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34; and &#34;Infallible&#34; and then turn pensive with &#34;Pendulum&#34; which is excellent. Skip to &#34;Sleeping By Myself&#34; which is nice and then, in my not so humble opinion, the best song on the album, the closing track, &#34;Future Days&#34;.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder and company have a hidden strength with spare songs like &#34;Sirens&#34;, &#34;Pendulum&#34;, &#34;Sleeping By Myself&#34; and especially &#34;Future Days&#34;. It's these moments that I find the band has grown up, has set aside it's youthful angst, and has come up with songs that are timeless and full of depth, not just hard chargers that bowl you over and trample you down.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34; is four stars. Not quite as good as &#34;Backspacer&#34; or &#34;Pearl Jam&#34;, but not by much. Keep up the great work guys. I'm not a tremendous Pearl Jam fan. In fact, I hated 'grunge' at the time it was popular, but it was Pearl Jam that first drew my attention to the movement with &#34;Vitalogy&#34; and I've bought all of their albums since that time including their first two. My relationship with the band's music has been a very slow growing, evolving appreciation for their music over the past 22 years. Now I can't imagine my musical world without them, Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana and to a much lesser extent, Soundgarden.<br /><br />Here's how &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34; compares with Pearl Jam's previous works:<br /><br />1991 Ten: Four Stars<br />1993 Vs.: Three and a Half Stars<br />1994 Vitalogy: Four Stars<br />1996 No Code: Three and a Half Stars<br />1998 Yield: Three and a Half Stars<br />2000 Binaural: Three and a Half Stars<br />2002 Riot Act: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 Pearl Jam: Four Stars<br />2009 Backspacer: Five Stars<br />2013 Lightning Bolt: Four Starswith songs that are timeless and full of depth, not just hard chargers that bowl you over and trample you down.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is &#34;Lightning Bolt&#34; is four stars.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As a Grisham reader, I always thought Time To Kill would always stand as his first and best novel.  I believe I was mistaken.  Sycamore Row is a thoroughly engrossing read, all with well-depicted strengths and frailties of the characters that make me believe I would know them if ever we met.  A proper ending was not a surprise, and my only question was whether the author would take us there or make us suffer judicial injustice ever after.  Bravo John Grisham... And thanks.
B00ERIUO02|3.0|Katy Perry is a guilty pleasure for several reasons. First, her music has a 'corporate pop' manufactured quality--you know, where it seems that producers and record execs have more creative control than the actual artist. Second, Katy Perry's rise to fame is littered with calculated steps to make it into everyone's homes. Third, the songwriting lacks depth most of the time, only occasionally hitting an emotional resonance on a song like &#34;By The Grace Of God&#34;. Fourth, at age 29, who is her target audience? 13 year olds? 18 year olds? 21 year olds? It can't be much higher than that, except, maybe, for Volvo driving soccer moms?<br /><br />That being said, &#34;Prism&#34; offers up Perry's most mature batch of cookies this side of Betty Crocker. If the confectionery of &#34;Teenage Dream&#34; with its 8 hit singles wasn't enough, then here's some more on &#34;Prism&#34;. I have all three of Perry's albums (I wouldn't dream of buying her CCM 2001 debut). If you thought her last two albums were crude in places (&#34;I Kissed A Girl&#34;, &#34;Ur So Gay&#34;, &#34;Peacock&#34;, &#34;Circling The Drain&#34;) then you will be happy to know that's pretty much gone here on &#34;Prism&#34; with one exception being &#34;Birthday&#34; where there is an f-bomb. Yes, it does appear that Perry is at least attempting a stab at maturity this time around (it's about time you know, she is 29 after all).<br /><br />But like her previous two albums, &#34;Prism&#34; has some string of duds like &#34;Walking On Air&#34;, &#34;Unconditionally&#34; which are average, and &#34;Dark Horse&#34; and &#34;This Is How We Do&#34; which are nearly cringe-worthy, topped off with &#34;International Smile&#34; which is arguably average as well.<br /><br />But, the album opens with &#34;Roar&#34;, &#34;Legendary Lovers&#34; and &#34;Birthday&#34; which are all solid tracks lyrically and musically. Strangely, after the string of so-so tracks the end of the album picks up where it started with five more solids tracks in the form of &#34;Ghost&#34;, &#34;Love Me&#34;, &#34;This Moment&#34;, &#34;Double Rainbow&#34; and &#34;By The Grace Of God&#34;. I opted out of the three bonus tracks because 13 is enough Katy Perry for me without getting a sugar hangover.<br /><br />Still, if you asked me, and I know you didn't, I'd say that &#34;Teenage Dream&#34; is the best of her past three albums. &#34;Prism&#34; would be next, and &#34;One Of The Boys&#34; would be next and, well, without even listening to it, her CCM debut would be rock bottom for me.<br /><br />And that's one final thing that's amusing about Katy Perry and her 'new' music. If you read her biography she was raised in a strictly religious home without exposure to popular secular music. I can't imagine what that's like because I was listening to secular music since time out of mind. And isn't it funny, once again, that another young woman starts of squeaky clean, doing CCM, fails, comes back 'reimagined' and is lewd and crude and even obnoxious, and claims this is the 'real' me. Katy Perry Hudson is a paradox, a mental conundrum. At least she didn't become AS sexual as say Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears or Lady Gaga, or for that matter, even Madonna. She's managed to retain some semblance of chastity. So, what are we to believe? Is &#34;Prism&#34; the real Katy Perry, less lewd than the one who sang &#34;I Kissed A Girl&#34; and &#34;Peacock&#34;? &#34;Prism&#34; seems a crossroads of sorts and a possible future for more mature music to come. Perhaps this is a new beginning?<br /><br />Here's how &#34;Prism&#34; compares with her previous works:<br /><br />2001 Katy Hudson: (No thank you to CCM)<br />2008 One Of The Boys: Two and a Half Stars<br />2010 Teenage Dream: Three and a Half Stars<br />2013 Prism: Three Starse more solids tracks in the form of &#34;Ghost&#34;, &#34;Love Me&#34;, &#34;This Moment&#34;, &#34;Double Rainbow&#34; and &#34;By The Grace Of God&#34;.

B004XIZLAY|3.0|The first chapter is majestic. Kissinger, an acknowledged master diplomat  and statesman, explains how China has always differed form other countries, how the Chinese themselves have often perceived that difference., and what principles govern their foreign policy. What comes later, however, is disappointing; plain diplomatic history consisting as one of my professors used to say, of \\"what one secretary told another.\\"<br /><br />I did not bother to read it to the end.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Webber's followup to &#34;Phantom&#34; is fantastic.  It's taped live on stage, but the cinematography is outstanding.  It is not just a camera set on a tripod watching it all from one location. Iinstead the footage is up close and personal on stage.  The acting was believable and the lighting and scenery were very well done.  The music is not as catchy as &#34;phantom&#34; but still has some memorable melodies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!!! I love it (even my daughter likes it [She plays it all the time].). My husband once tried this game on his<br />phone. He liked it but he, all of a sudden, said &#34;I'm deleting this game. I have pop-ups!&#34;. We're fine and haven't had any pop-ups!!
B003VANOFY|3.0|Pros:<br /><br />-Mic self-mutes when moved upward.<br />-Volume control on headset<br />-Very comfortable for long sessions<br />-Great battery life, can be used while charging.<br />-Good range<br />-Clear audio<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Connection inexplicably cuts out about once an hour, automatically reconnects. It's extremely annoying<br />-Sound doesn't get super-loud. It's decent, but I'd expect a little more power for the price.<br />-Bass is very, very weak.<br />-Software surround sound isn't very convincing, cuts/changes are sharp and sudden<br /><br />Overall, they are decent. The audio is clear, although some games/movies may not be as loud as you'd like. Bass is very weak, and the fact the it regularly disconnects/reconnects is a HUGE issue.  The surround sound effect is passable but I'd probably go with a powerful stereo set next time.

0345522478|4.0|Is it enough to say I really, really loved this?  Do I need to write a longer review?  I probably should.<br /><br />The first book in Kevin Hearne's \\"Iron Druid\\" series introduces us to Atticus O'Sullivan (who should rightfully be called Siodhachan O Suileabhain, but man that's a bitch to type and to pronounce), and right off the bat Atticus provides the kind of snarky first-person narration that I love about my other favorite Urban Fantasy series, the Dresden Files. Which is not meant to imply that Kevin Hearne is channeling Jim Butcher, or that Atticus O'Sullivan is simply Harry Dresden with red hair and tats. I think it's fair to say the Dresden-Druid comparisons end with \\"contemporary urban fantasy, first person narration, male main character.\\" The setting (warm Tempe vs. cold Chicago), the pacing, the supporting cast are all sufficiently different to put to rest any rumors that Hearne's books are \\"Dresden Lite.\\"<br /><br />What we get in this first book is a pretty straightforward origin story. Despite Atticus' best attempts to keep his the origins of his immortality a secret, he does end up telling us pretty much everything about how he got his start, and drops large hints about where he's been and what he's done in the twenty-one centuries since. You've got to love a guy who name-drops Genghis Khan, Galileo and Van Gogh (all world-changers, and only one as completely bat-s*** crazy as his contemporaries claimed) before he's even told you his own name.  I admire Hearne's willingness to lay bare Atticus' major secrets (how he became immortal, how he gained possession of Fragrach, why he's chosen Arizona of all places to live) not only in the first book of the series but also fairly early in the book. I think in this day and age of series-oriented fantasy, it takes guts to remove any sense of mystery by revealing most of your main character's back-story right off the bat; it shows a trust that the readers will stick with the series because Atticus and his pals are interesting people in their own right rather than for the slow-reveal of Atticus' origin.<br /><br />Of course, we don't just get an origin story. The book does, after all, take place in the present day and far away from the ancient Celtic lands. Once the story gets rolling, there's plenty of fight scenes that build from mildly exciting (for the characters involved, I mean) to life-or-death. The pacing is a bit languid at the beginning but full-tilt high-adrenaline by the end.  There are catch-your-breath chapters in all the right places, and nice comedic moments interspersed. The supporting cast are all introduced in logical, story-driven ways -- not the \\"oh, I need to introduce X now, so I'll just have my MC get a random phone call\\" method that some authors stumble with -- and the city is a pretty solid character in its own right, another trick some \\"urban fantasy\\" series bungle. There are some supporting characters I'm more intrigued by than others -- Atticus' dog Oberon, the local bartender Granuile, and the death goddess Morrigan all added depth to the story and in the case of the latter two characters had me wanting to learn far more about them, while I felt the vampire and werewolf lawyers are, at least in this first book, a bit stereotypical and one-dimensional ... but not every supporting character can be fully explored in a single book, and I suspect future installments will flesh out Hauk, Magnusson and Flidias and the Tempe Coven.  I have to say, though, the most fun supporting character introduced (other than Oberon, who is such a good dog, yes he is) is the widow MacDonagh, who I look forward to seeing a lot more of.<br /><br />Hearne manages to give us a done-in-one adventure that drops plenty of hints of what's to come as the series progresses, and I'm glad I'm finally along for the ride.people in their own right rather than for the slow-reveal of Atticus' origin.

I'd buy another when I wear this one out!!
B007R3AZNK|3.0|Not at all as good as I had expected from the reviews , etc. More subdued and laid-back than what I was looking for. Not as edgy or creative as I had hoped.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I really like ARTPOP. Its a fun album that isn't meant to be taken as seriously as Born This Way. Its more of a party. It reminds me of &#34;The Fame&#34;
B00EDOS6IC|3.0|Similar to previous from them, this is a good CD. There are a few really great songs, but most of it is pretty average.  Not terribly impressed, but not really disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are good, it isn't hard to obtain the items you need to build or accomplish tasks and the time is as good to be expected. The game does seem to be free all the way, I am at level 65 now and have not been asked to pay. All around I give it 5 stars!
B0000669JL|4.0|Great compilation of his music. Not all original recordings, but still very good. Nothing new, but what you would expect.
0345501292|5.0|At this house, we love Indiana jones. And this book is the ultimate, information packed book for Indie. I recommend it for movie buffs
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the book.  Since I love flowers that part fascinated me - an important part of the story.  Most of book-club really  like it too.
6305127697|5.0|If you like good court room movies, this is one to watch.  I never heard of Edward Norton before this movie.  He is fantastic in it.  I have seen him in many more since.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney are great together.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|CAN'T GIVE 5 STARS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T VIEWED IT....PURCHASED FOR A GIFT BUT I AM SURE IT WILL BE ENJOYED
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Loved it. Good chemistry between actors. Plot not as good as original. Loved the funeral home scene. I hate when the review asks for more words when I think I've said enough
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Starting with season 1, this is a totally entrancing series!  Great character and plot developement!  You cannot wait until it is time to watch the next episode!  This is one of the best!  My wife and I both love Downton Abbey and always look foreord to watching it together!  Every season a real winner but if you've missed season one and two you will want them also!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Excellent study on success! If you have ever wondered about why success is easy for some and difficult for others, this read is for you.  Very interesting.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Won't let me stay aboard.  I run out of &#34;lives&#34; too quickly.  Then I have to let time pass or &#34;buy&#34; more.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|My first range finder...I'm very impressed. Easy to use and pretty accurate. I've only used it once, so I don't have any opinion on the battery issues. But if I end up having the same issues, I'll come back and update my post.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I really enjoyed the special effects here.  Makes me wonder about flying.  Would a pilot really sky drive high & drunk?
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. It started out good but it went on and on about the drug experience until I couldn't wait until the book ended. The entire middle section could have been left out. In addition the conclusion was disappointing.
0385351399|1.0|AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Boring, repetitive, verbose, facile - ultimately disappointing. If only I could get the time back spent reading this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It helps keep me on track and use my Kindle! It just keeps getting better and better! I enjoy all my Kindles and apps.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A strange kind of magical. A kind of Alice in Wonderland feel. The imagination of a child in an adult world.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Candy Crush is 40 levels behind Apple, Google, and Window. I am sticking with the new Ipad on my next purchase.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|My grandson love to play with trains.  They are his favorite thing to play with.  That is about all he wants to play with and I know he will love this train.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story line at first was revolting yet intriguing. It captures starkly where we could go. I cried trough the last two parts of the last book. But hope continues for those of us who look for the dandelion in the spring.
1476729085|5.0|Graeme Simsion's novel about figuring out love and the illogical nature of attraction is just about perfect.  It's not perfect, just near it.  But it really is as good as the hype, which says something.  The Rosie Project follows genetics Professor Don Tillman as he attempts to find a wife, or rather, someone suitable for him as potential wife material.  He has some very stringent criteria that a woman must meet in order to even be considered for a date with him.  Rosie, whom Don meets because of a mutual acquaintance, is absolutely not a good wife project candidate, quickly ticking off boxes against her favor in Don's mind.  But he finds he misses her presence more than being in it.  When she asks for help with a project of her own, Don inexplicably agrees and finds he does not know why.  Part romance, part comedy, part self-reflecting journey, this book is a whole lot of fun from the first page to the last.<br /><br />Where Simsion really excels is consistency.  Don's voice throughout feels realistic but uncommon.  The trajectory of the story and Don's growth makes sense and is extremely well constructed.  Where Don is totally clueless, readers are somewhat in the know.  This all adds to the fun because, eventually, you know Don will get there too.  This is a wholly original voice and so well done that it is completely enthralling.  If I seem to be raving, it is because this has to be considered one of the best books of the year period.  Well worth reading for the uniqueness of Don's voice.  Come for the characters, stay for the hilarity and truths about life that ensue.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|watch Olympus has fallen if you looking for a great movie<br />this one is good but is a low budget of Olympus has fallen but all in all its ok and is funny.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't want to read these books at first. I reluctantly bought them. After I started reading them, I was done within days. Riveting.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|excellent book and the movie was good as well<br />must read the whole series i recommend to anyone<br />a must read
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a great story teller and this returns to his original style, which I think is much better than the later technique.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I was completely satisfied with my buy. I had been looking for a set like this for a while. Delighted!
B00005MM67|5.0|This is a movie I have on laser disc and I am gradually replacing those with DVD versions. This movie, for my wife and me, is worth watching over and over again. I really appreciate how it shows relationships, and how the people responded to severe circumstances.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This music is a MUST to keep on your recorder and enjoy during and throughout the Christmas Holidays - one I keep on my Bose for parties and just enjoyable listening - it's one of the happiest and best of all Christmas music!  The title is so fitting because 'these truly ARE the special times in our lives'!  Life really is 'A Special Occasion'!  Enjoy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just started playing the game just last week and now I'm hooked to this game. When I haven't played on my kindle fire for a few days this is the first thing I play. I like subway surfers but minion rush is so much better.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|The book gives some good advices for starters -- how to start working remotely (for a person, team or a company) and why to do that. But don't expect to get some detailed \\"how to\\" for teams or individuals who already work remotely.<br /><br />Still, it is written in easy to read style and I enjoyed reading it, and got one or two good ideas to think about in the process. My advice: give it a try.
0439023513|5.0|If you have seen the original Hunger games and have read catching fire You must read this novel as it provides the ending<br />and no doubt the third movie in this trilogy
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always, John Grisham has created another legal masterpiece. This is a spellbinding novel that grabs the reader and doesn't let go until the last page, the last sentence, the very last word. Give yourself time to read the whole book, because you won't want to put it down!
8866137626|4.0|I was always a Moleskine Junkie. I use all of the latest digital technology but still need to use a pen and paper to bring out my creative juices.  The Moleskine notebook does that well.  Now combine the notebook with Evernote and have all of your notebooks with you every where you go and searchable to boot.  I use a Moleskine at my desk and every morning put the date at the top of the page.  During the day I keep notes, phone numbers, ideas. etc in the Moleskine.  Every day or two I  capture the pages with the Evernote page camera and then quickly add tags to each page in Evernote. (I actually write the tags I use in the Moleskine and circle them.)  If I ever need to find a phone number -- or every thing about a certain project or person all I have to do is complete a search for that particular tag in Evernote.  This is a great tool for staying organized!  The Moleskine book and 3 month subscription saves you a couple of bucks instead of buying separately and is imprinted with the Evernote logo.  Maybe someday they will come out with other cover colors besides black!  If you like to keep track of everything and take pride in doing that .. then this will work for you!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It is a great game. It has some freezes sometimes, asides that it is great and I highly recommend this game.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Very interesting. Watched the TV series then read the book and I really enjoyed it now reading the next one
B005F265CA|4.0|It's a fun western comedy with a twist! Mel Gibson and James Garner make a very fun combo to watch!
B007Q0OV6Q|1.0|Product arrived missing many of the pieces, specifically pieces 9493 (day 2), 9516 (day 9), 9497 (day 12), and 9498 (day 18). My kids are very disappointed! When I asked for the missing pieces to be delivered or a new box to be exchanged for this one, I was told that was not possible. VERY disappointing.
B00FEJT38M|5.0|Greenify provides different functionality than typical task killers and the apps that set memory thresholds for Android.  You can choose which specific apps you want to forbid from running in the background, depriving you from memory and CPU resources.  Many installed apps (e.g. news apps) behave as if they knew better than you what your needs are and with enough many of those your phone can be brought to a stall.  Greenify suggests which apps you might want to hibernate when not run in the foreground.  With Xposed Framework installed, in addition to Greenify, you can even hibernate system apps, though not necessarily effectively.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is amazing. But there is no megalodan only a great white. Other than that this game is amazing I absolutely love it. I may be a girl but this game is so much.<br />LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Too addictive! I can't stop playing it. Has 4 levels and is easy to use. What more can I say?
B009TGODOK|2.0|2 1/2 stars. I usually like Woody Allen's films and this one had the great location, the beautiful people, the charming background music but the story left me flat. Definitely not one of Woody's better films.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|Used it a few times and tossed it. I thought I'd like it. It has a lot of features, but I don't have the patience.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Loved it! I defiantly will die waiting until next May! :(!! This book is a great page turner!<br />Team Maxon!!<br /><br />Update: LUCY IS IN LOVE WITH ASPEN!! HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS BEFORE?! OH GOODNESS, YET ANOTHER REASON I NEED MAY RIGHT NOW!!
B007AL48UK|3.0|It's okay. Has a few levels and layouts, and cheats so you can win, but you have to pay to get access to other levels. I didn't like that. If it's not included, don't put the levels on the game. Make it an option or something.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Well Duh! It's the Big Bang Theory! it's like watching &#34;Friends&#34; for nerds. The characters are great and the fat that it's the Fourth season and they still have interesting story lines is good.
B003274QH6|5.0|The best series on TV ever.  Great writing, acting and cast. If you didn't know anything about meth and how bad it is you will after watching this series.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|couldn't put this book down. so beautiful and raw....perspective was different as seen through the eyes of death.  laughed and cried.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|American horror story is one of the most original series on TV. Each season is completely different from the last. Most of the stars return each season but in completely different roles. This second season is about an insane asylum and the people the run it. This series is very intense. Not recommended for kids. The acting is fantastic and the story is great. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't even care too give this a star.  The time limit  on this does not . Makes sense on it
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I listen to anything by Joe Bonamassa.  He's an incredible guitarist who never fails to entertain and deliver listening amazements.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|If you want a taste of Heavy Metal at its best than this is a great CD to get. I think this makes the sixth CD I have worn out. I was twelve years old when it came and it still gives me goosebumps when I listen to it. Dave Mustaine at his very best. I love all his work but this album is special!! Buy it and love it!!!
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I love this game, so that why I'm so disappointed when I reached level 7 and the game force me to spend all my CROWNS to buy items to advance (much faster than on Facebook). Sorry but I'm one of those ppl that thinks it's ridiculous to spend real money on something such as a game. Such a shame, I was seriously looking forward to this game. My friends and I stopped playing it ages ago on Facebook bc it would freeze up our computers with all the things it had to download, plus by level 30 they forced you to buy CROWNS or you couldn't advance. Change the CROWNS or make them easier to get and ppl will come back Castleville.
1439190275|5.0|I finally got motivated to lose weight. I had used Atkins in the 1970's and 1980's  and it worked so I decided to do it again.  It's only been a week and I've lost 6 lbs and feel more energetic. I have about 40 more lbs to reach my goal,<br />I'm feeling positive!
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|It's an interesting game to play. No seek or searches. Fast pace game keeps you on your toes. Wish it was longer free game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I lol the world know that feel when you were on the way to my dad lets you right now and then whatever that's not gonna happen if you have the whole world to see if the whole thing your blanket of it is coming to the whole world to see the whole of it is your a cheerleader and suicide
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is full of great info although it scared the heck out of all of us the night we watched it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I enjoyed playing the game immensely. I am sure many others will feel the same. I looke forward to many hours of fun
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|If u like Call of Duty online stuff like deathmatch and domination, u need to get this game it is so freaking fun. IT IS SO FREAKING FUN. Yes I said it twice
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|As usual this was purchased for my grandsons and they have really gotten into battle games.  They like to select their robots and battle the other robots.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has written another fabulous book. He is one of my favorite authors and always manages to write wonderful page turning books. His characters just jump off the page.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I don't like this game because my car tips over to much and I hate how much the cars cost.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|There is no light in the entryway of our condo - no windows or anything. Pitch black. When bought this light for when we need a little light but don't need to turn on the light switch. Its also nice to have for when we come in after dark and have a ton of stuff in our hands/arms. Its a great little motion sensor and it has great range. 5 stars!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game. I love logic games and this one moves seamlessly between the puzzles. I especially like the extra puzzles of blocks and pipes
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|GREAT stuff! The English 'soap opera' scores again...but REALLY, life was NOT that hard, to survive the war, but lose the battle anyways.....a bit much on that ending...
B003O86FMW|4.0|Can't wait to read mockingjay, this book was great, as good as I expected it to be. Will watch the movie as well.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo28TDHA30PZEMT]]Well...I just got my hands on it right now....setup was fast and kind of easy...but...BUT...I am having issues with the netflix cast....something is wrong...and the online help is not HELPING AT ALL...I already emailed their support department...lets wait and see what they will tell me....and yes...I made sure I had all the software involved up to date...I am trying to use it with a Samsung tablet (Android) and an iphone (just downloaded the chrome cast app and netflix app to it)..all netflix versions work fine WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE DEVICES...as soon as I click on the cast icon....things go downhill....another thing....it runs really HOT...I am concerned about that...<br />UPDATE<br />I got frustrated and angry...support will only advise me to \\"reboot\\"which I already did...I tried it with and android device and with iphone device...same results for the netflix problem...I upload a video...I am sorry...I mix spanish/english languages on my talk...but you DO GET the idea !
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I hate it I am trying to get injustice gods among us<br />Man was I wrong and that's cold nobody get this
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Very funny for kids and adults! :-) I think it is as good, or close to as good as the first one. I pre-ordered it for my kids for Christmas!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have a love-hate thing going on with this game...it's very addictive but hard to win some levels.  I don't like that it runs out of lives and you have to wait to continue unless you buy lives.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game. It is exactly like the original game. You need a combination of luck and skill to win.
0743582055|4.0|BUYER BEWARE:<br />At least for the unabridged 2-disk audio CD version (ISBN: 978-0-7435-8205-6), I had issues reading the CD because it's an &#34;Enhanced CD&#34;. This resulted in my Mac only recognizing the audio files on both CDs (not the PDF or the software). My Windows 8 machine recognized the PDF, but not any of the audio on the first CD. On my second try, my Mac recognized the data and audio portions of the extended CD as two separate partitions.<br /><br />Enhanced CDs should be playable as regular music CDs, but they have an extra partition for data. This may cause issues for your computer.<br /><br />Minus one star for a troublesome data format. The PDF is fun, however!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|You better have very good reflexes because this game starts getting harder and harder but it's fun. Get as many bannas as you can without crashing into something.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive!  I haven't been willing to pay to play,though, so there's a lot of waiting.  You can buy extra time to make the next level, and there is ALWAYS a next level.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|The book was so great and I thought when I read it that it could make a really interesting and suspenseful film...not in these hands.
B0039N74CW|5.0|Great movie. I don't know how many times I've watched it but I still think it's hysterical.<br /><br />The DVD came quickly and was exactly what I ordered.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br />-comfortable fit<br />-works more or less perfectly out of the box<br />-good sound<br />-long-lasting battery<br />-the included charging cable is long enough that you can wear them comfortably while they're plugged in<br />-wireless range is surprisingly long, I can often walk the entire length of my house and still get a signal<br /><br />Cons:<br />-while the 7.1 surround is pretty decent it's not going to be as good as actually having 7 speakers and a sub<br />-bass could be slightly stronger<br /><br />You may need to go into your sound settings and make it your default communication device (for the mic) and/or default speakers.
B000FC1PNE|4.0|Always entertaining.  I do like the multiple/series type of books because they complete the family.  Just nosy i guess, but there it is.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Great packaging, killer extras, incredible blu-ray picture quality but (sorry for the broken record pile-on here) needs the have the theatrical releases for the Original trilogy to get 5 stars.
B002RI90WM|3.0|An interesting story but I felt the stretching out of the central conflict was obvious and I ended up skipping whole passages of dog exposition where nothing much was happening just to find out the conclusion. So a good sense of tension, but it would have benefitted from perhaps being a more complex story where there was a sub-plot to support the central conflict that was also engaging.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It may not be the most romantically climatic ending, but it answers all your questions about Kat ending her journey as the mockingjay. Overall, I love this series!
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fun for the whole family, from age 5 and up. A great game. Even my 4 year old granddaughter picked up on it. Better than checkers, and easy to learn and play.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|One of the best TV Shows out there. Arrow is a Comic fans Dream Show. Well written and even better acting. You will not be dissapointed.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Fun and very addicting. I get caught up in the game for hours. I have only played two tracks, and never get tired of it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game allows you to get all your fav super hero's and fight. You can become the best fighting machine.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is fun and keeps my brain active you will love it.  I play all the time even the kids love.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always can count on getting my weather straight from The Weather Channel  and it's right on.<br />I love the alerts
B0063M22QO|5.0|Nice game. Love the tile set. This game is challenging enough to keep me occupied. I recommend this game to anyone who likes mahjong.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have read a few others of Singh's books from this series and was unimpressed. While the ones I read were definitely packed with great love scenes and lots of drama and action, Heart of Obsidian trumps them all.<br /><br />I love how for the first bit of the book we can't seem to tell what Kaleb, the ultimate bad guy, wants to do with Sahara, but it seems that the Net's existence hinges on her power. At first, I thought we were talking about her mental abilities, but we are surprised to learn that Sahara wields a different sort of power, and it just blows my mind!<br /><br />The relationship between the two of them is amazing! Sahara suffers a long-broken Silence, and Kaleb is the definition of it--cold, unfeeling, ruthless and powerful. He's so powerful, in fact, that it is no wonder why the whole Psy community should fear him. This guy plans to take control of their world! I applaud Singh for making Kaleb more than just a villain, for making me root for him as the book went on. He's not your typical anti-hero, who occasionally breaks the rules and delivers rough justice for the greater good; Kaleb is perfectly capable--and willing--to destroy the world in order to keep Sahara safe and happy, and he doesn't care how bloody his hands will be at the end of it all. And even as their relationship smooths some of Kaleb's edges, it's obvious that he's still going to be the dark villain we will all love.<br /><br />A definite plus for this book is the same thing that Benedict Cumberbatch had going for him in BBC's Sherlock Holmes--brainy, asexual guys are the new sexy. Why go for a virile hunk of man whose probably laid a hundred girls when you can have the sort of guy who has never noticed women before YOU and will never look at another?<br /><br />Read this book. It's amazing. Even if you have never liked any of the other Singh books, at least read this one. It's mindblowing.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Works great with you tube and netflix. The problem I have is with the Hulu plus app it takes for ever to load and then buffers the whole time. I have a roku also and don't have a problem loading or playing anything on the roku. Spend the extra money and get something that streams better.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Really good read!! I can't wait to read the rest of them. Recommended yo all who enjoy good romance novels!!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I like the humor in this book that continues to stand the test of time. Tom is humorous, engaging, amusing and universal. Twain is a master storyteller.
B006GKHE6G|1.0|Why?<br />I know the one star rating will draw mass thumbs down forssuch a popular game. I've had devs reply to my Flurry announcements before telling me they don't have time to analyze your data. If so, why do they include Flurry into the code to begin with? Could have been a top faotd.
B0083GDLL8|4.0|Some classic Bowie. Having grownup more on his later 70's and 80's stuff, I wasn't as familiar with his older stuff. Great Album
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|What can I say? Awesome! Action was non-stop! The characters were great also. I can't wait for the next Avengers movie!
B005EPKS8A|5.0|Great album. It's not just the Blues Brothers. It has Aretha Franklin, Ray CHarles, and James Brown tracks on it also.
B00CHOPEKI|3.0|Same problem as with the other Barbies  I bought at the same time.  All were just put in a large box with no packing and boxes beat each other up in shipping. These were meant as gifts so I wasn't at all happy.
B00181JGI2|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time.  Stars the great Jeff Bridges and is directed by the fellow Minnesotans, the Cohn brothers (Fargo and Raising Arizona).  I never get tired of this movie.
B00594XOZU|2.0|it wont let me sign in to my account it keeps telling me to sign in in a bit i tried everything to fix it what happened kik really kik u suck now
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun playing while sitting in my easy chair!  My hubby and I can both play at the same time.  A very relaxing game.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The plot twists kept me glued to my kindle! Martin manages to continue the story in an epic and intriguing way. Old characters continue to develop in ways previously unexpected and the perspective of new characters is brought into the fold. All in all this instalment to the series may have been the best yet!
B00DNB9RXO|4.0|Samsung galaxy s4, I really like this game! Awesome graphics, you can choose tilt, drag, or button controls.  Steer the cat-type thing through mazes. Collect the three diamonds and get to the end portal.  My ONLY complaint: it has force closed itself multiple multiple times since I started playing 1 hr ago. I don't normally rate/comment on games, but I like this one so much that I would *LOVE* it if the developers would solve this for me
B003LDKUSK|5.0|I am a teacher and I used this classic book in my Child Development class as an example of a high quality children's book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a must read.  One of those books you just can't put down. Lots of twists and turns.  Amazing!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Angry birds is a mindless settling game. Unless you don't like losing.  If you are one who has to win at all cost this game will blow your mind.  Personally I can't lose because when I play it I enjoy it.  that is a win in my book,
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The book goes no where.<br />I waited so long to get the book and was disappointed.<br />Not near the book as the 4 before.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|With a cast like Susan Sarandon, Jennifer Lopez, and Richard Gere how could a movie be bad.  It was as much about family relationships as it was dancing.  The whole movie was excellent from start to finish.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had not been able to enjoy the challenges of this game until it came to kindle. Now I'm addicted, and understand why everyone was always sending me requests. Now I'm the one constantly sending the requests.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Very fun and clean comedy. The story is as good a quality as Ice Age . I would recommend it to my friends and extended family.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and in 0.8.0 there will be new mobs,caves,redstone and minecarts!!! this is the best game ever I love minecraft
B0007OCG56|1.0|This product is great, but buy it from someone other than Amazon.  Customer service is terrible and refuses to provide any help whatsoever if anything goes wrong.  You are MUCH better off paying a little more and buying from a retailer you can trust.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this movie! We have caught it many times on TV on weekends and watch it again every time. It is well worth seeing. It encompasses different time periods and monsters and has it all. Caviezel shines as always. The cast is great and the story very unique. It is fun and entertaining and heart warming all at once.

1891252089|5.0|This book is excellent.  The format is especially good for those newer to ashtanga--providing the clearest and largest photos of each asana along with modified variations.  Helpful to support home practice even for those who benefit from Mysore classes.  Ring bound format lays flat for use during practice.
0140157352|5.0|5 stars; Good book, great shipper, great price; wish you could buy a book and also get a digital copy
1594744769|3.0|Not everyone would like this book.  However, as a fantasy, I found it fascinating and worth reading.  It was hard to remember why the story came about; but once again, at the end,<br />we are reminded of the reason for the tale.
B00ESY6TKY|1.0|The absolute worst movie ever. Can't stand the narration. Leo does a good job, but spiderman wanna be does not
B009AMANBA|5.0|The more I read of the life of Lincoln, the more I am amazed.  Such a fine man, who changed the world.  This is a serious and excellent DVD&#62;
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The story line in this book was really captivating. I could not put this book down!!!! It was amazing. I loved it.
0547848412|5.0|Fascinating.  One only wonders how this could be true.  A tiger and a man in the same boat.<br />Hmmmmm!  It's a lovely story of how, when stranded, that man and animal can survive.<br />A book and also a DVD.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Great movie, great acting, great direction.  Finally got to see the complete movie, not cut down version shown in theaters and on TV.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Everyone should be acquainted with this DVD.  It takes place during the Second World War.<br />A nun brings joy to a large family with a traveling father, who misses his deceased wife.  Music<br />returns to the family.  There is intrigue with a surprise ending.
B00G70WLJA|5.0|Awesome Movie and would look at it over and over again.  I love the writing it all fell into place perfectly.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|The Schrade schf9 is an excellent knife for the price. The handle material has the right amount tact for a solid grip in wet conditions. The coating is showing wear after batoning oak and pine, but i haven't see a knife coating yet that doesn't wear. The heat treat seems to be good; I haven't had problems with chipping of the blade. With the proper oiling and maintenance, this knife will last a long time in heavy use roles.<br />The only negative was the edge geometry; it was uneven and overly steep angle. It's sharp out box, but it will really perform with a slightly shallower edge angle. I redid the angle at 30* each side of the blade; it takes a while to do because the wave in knife profile. The time is well worth it, the schf9 performs and feels like a much higher-end knife, now.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This is a very interesting and motivational book! I have enjoyed reading it! This is definitely a great find! Great book about the Law of Attraction!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is written in a very unusual way. It talks of colors. At first your just hopping that you will understand. When you are done you will.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Had to uninstall because the newest update did not allow me to turn off notifications! I would even use a task killer to turn off the app and it would pop back up and interfere with other apps I was running.
B005LJITS0|5.0|Great cast & special effects. Pure entertainment. You will enjoy this movie if all you're expecting is action and vicarious superhero thrills. Critics panned this but they rave about the plodding, 2 1/2 hour long, dialogue heavy, artsy-fartsy crap. Critics are self important losers. This is a fun show to watch.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Great, Clear Jazz, soulful voice, first track is the best on the CD. I'm looking to add more of her work to my collection.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|My first read of a Gillian Flynn novel and now I'll try another. Excellent well thought out and well written. Highly recommend it. The language is colourful but once you get over that it's terrific.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game, lots of fun. Daily spins for tokens, and only two tokens to play each game. Chatting available during game, and plenty players online around the clock. A must have game for me.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was VERY excited to read this after I finished Insurgent . I had noted that in Insurgent , the plot went up and down , but I stayed faithful and finished it. I dunno , I guess I thought the plot would get better. Maybe I Set my hopes to high. Because it SUCKED.  I may only be twelve and a genius at reading but I've never really read a horrid book like this one.  SPOILERS : okay first off there are SO many meaning less deaths in Allegiant. They barely get any recognition . They come quick and leave quicker . First off Tori dies and only gets a page worth of recognition and when they do s they remind the reader only that she was a Dauntless leader. Boom ! Pow! OVER. Then Edward dies , after he tries to destroy the Choosing Ceremony bowls. He dies and ( if I recall ) kills another man an  shatters the man's shoulder with a sledgehammer. Huh ? What ?! Why would they do something SO dumb. ???? Another thing I was excited about for Allegiant was for the cliffhanger ending : \\" what's behind the fence?\\" It prompted me to TRY and get through the book and left me with more questions than I started with. On truth Chicago was an e experiment on genetic crap. Blah blah. Continuous in this book Four /Tobias loses his awesomeness . In the first book he was awesome but in this book I wanted Tris to break up with him  he sucked that bad. At the end Tris gets killed. REALLYAnd I  end up angry REALLY?! At this point I give up. I will NEVER READ THIS BOOK AGAIN. I will read the first two but not this one. If you wish to be dissapointed read this book. But be warned its STUPID
B00EDK1LP6|5.0|This soundtrack is probably one of the best ones I have purchased in a long time. Lots of guitar work and I can't really say that I ever have a desire to fast forward through a track.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is a very fun game it downloaded easily no problem but the only problem with me is that when I am playing on the game, in the middle of the battle it closes, but it still a very good game and is very addicting.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|the acting is jaw dropping. the dialogue is fantastic.<br />simple yet profound. amazing collaboration btw actors and director.<br />greatly enjoyed it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book. A very engrossing story. A story that needed to be told. Would make a terrific movie. Highly recommended!
B005D63ICI|5.0|one of my favorite seasons. i loved the ending.<br /><br />this series IS addictive. great acting from julia stiles and michael c hall and jennifer carpenter and everyone - as usual.<br />can't wait to watch the other seasons.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Awesome book I recommend it to people who like the Percy Jackson series it's amazing I can't wait to find out who the seven are
B006LSZECO|1.0|Ugh. Why is this book so popular?  I don't get it.  I didn't care about either character and didn't care who killed whom.  I didn't relate to anyone at all.  Some friends said she killed him, some said she didn't.  I don't care.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I did not know much about SeaWorld til I saw this documentry. I am ashamed at SeaWorld! I am glad to only have been there once in my life and to have been little and not remember anything. I cried a lot while viewing this film. I loved it. Proud to own it!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I think it is a really good game. It has 3d and weapons and stuff and I recommend you should play it
B000A6T1KE|4.0|I bought this movie because I am a huge fan of all things &#34;Star Trek.&#34;  Plus, it is the last film in which the &#34;Next Generation&#34; cast appeared.  It's not the best &#34;Trek&#34; movie out there, but it's good...definitely worth picking up whether you're a hardcore Trekkie, or a casual fan.  The DVD came early, and I got a great deal on it!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game deserves 5 stars ,because it has action and great graphics. You can tell the designers worked hard for this game.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Great movie, starring a young Val Kilmer.  It's a musical, and a parody of those old war/romance films.  Super funny all the way through.
B00EEXST2K|3.0|Not exactly sure what I expected...I mainly ordered this because Amanda's an amazing actress. It was an interesting portrayal of Linda Lovelaces life.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Not the most well written book I've ever read but adequately written. However the story truly is remarkable. What a large sociological experiment the Korean peninsular is. Hard to believe this story is contemporary; I would like to think this kind of atrocity of a country is something from the distant past. A good reminder of how far most of us have come and how far we still have to go as a planet.
B008JFUS5A|1.0|A strong Oscar contender, in a crowded, growing field, for Worst film of the Year. It has no visible acting, scripting, action, plot, cinematography, music, or purpose, other than to draw in viewers of the first one. A disgraceful production and a fraud.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This is a great album.  When looked back on in time, this will rank as Gaga's greatest work.  I want to sue her, however, because Sex Dreams will not leave my head!!!  I applaud her and her range in art and in life.  Do not underestimate this Goddess.
B008602KQI|5.0|I always resist giving any bock, song or movie a 2 or 5 stars rating because the deciders predicatively write back suggesting I missed the structure, plot or stars in the movie. But I will take a chance and unequivocally give this video 5 full stars. Perhaps it is because  I never read the book (since I lean towards religious or political book topics).<br />  The movie is full action with lots of violence, murder and mayhem, due mainly to the governmental behavior. This is great for the drama but the love inference and romance should not be forgotten. The characters and their demeanor wins over the negativity they are faced with.  Rent it if you must but this movie is a keeper BUY IT and the low price shown especially if you invest in AMAZON PRIME. (sorry for the commercial, but I use Prime for almost all of my Christmas shopping, movie watching and purchases).
B009NF54ZE|2.0|To much reading with no skips but it is fun when you get to play<br />All in all its a ok<br /><br />,,
B00EDUTGB2|5.0|It has worked very well. It prints without problems and was relatively quick. It took a short while to install but no problems since then.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great series. Great price. Only one  disc has a small defect. Does not overshadow the joy of having the whole series commercial free.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|There is very little; this Lady can sing, that I don't like........<br /><br />immensely!!!  It will show in the many CD's I have...
B000F3AAUW|3.0|I love the song &#34;Crazy&#34; so I thought the rest of the album would be just as good.  Failed to impress and I don't listen to it much.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|this album actually changed my life. It defined music an made mtv what it was when the ACTUALLY played music
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Very good cd!  She has a wonderful voice and does the music proud!  I also have several of her other cd's that aren't xmas cds and I love them also.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It's so good the guns the costumes the vehicle's Gameloft you done it again great game and nice job with it
B00G4NUQYM|4.0|Great for anyone who loves word games. Similar to syllacrostics. Helps to keep your mind sharp. Fills down time with lots of fun.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Setup is easy and device is small and neat but its extremly limited in terms of apps which can be displayed on your TV.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is written in such a way that you get to do these great little experiments that confirm what you've read before and hoped was true, really is true. We are in charge and we create everyday so we need to be sure we create what we really want. This book lets us focus on different aspects of creation and highlight practices or beliefs to confirm what we've read is real.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|I mostly use this lens for video because I'm a photographer at my church and i would recommend this lens for anyone who loves to do video photography and picture taking. Yet the auto focus is slow, but that's ok i mostly don't use it anyway.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its like a small Kindle for your Phone!!! It seems to work fine. obviously the screen is smaller. and stuff
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent drama and high quality video.  Sure hope I get to see season 4 soon!  Really enjoyed this series!  Love!
B00ENPX5H8|3.0|I thought i would give these guys a try based on the comparisons to Radiohead and Porcupine Tree, but I have to admit after many plays  it`s just not clicking with me. Production and music wise it`s very good but lyrically it just sounds too forced to my ears. Many years ago I made a compilation of Radiohead`s b sides from The Bends and each time I listen to Tightly Unwound it reminds me of that.. Maybe I`ll give it a few more spins or check out another of their albums.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Girsham can spin a tale.  Amazon provides the book in whispersync - audio book coupled with Kindle version.  His plot unfolds like a the blackjack cards laid down by a Vegas dealer - crisp, sharp, and fast.  I gave this book four stars because I did not like the ending.  I don't know what I would have done, but it just didn't work for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but I would like to know when 8.1 will come out. I would reccomend getting it.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|This is not a 4-star movie.  The plot is cumbersome and takes a long time to unfold.  However, the actors are fantastic.  The scenery and special effects - what I call production values - are outstanding.  This is an enjoyable film, but it is not a great film.  After all, this is superman.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Near non stop action all the way. Was a bit disappointed to realise the next book is only due in 6 months.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Nicole Kidman - dancing, singing, acting.  The music and choreography are fantastic.  For some viewers, this will not be their cup of tea:  this rendition is not for everyone.  However, the music, dancing, acting, etc. rang my bell.  I've played parts of this over and over and bought the CD/MP3.
B00C3HN1RM|5.0|I sent this gift box to my friend for her birthday and she was thrilled!  She read them and loved the story
B00AEFXTKO|5.0|This one is a great one!  Dreamgirls is a faithful representation of the top Motown girl group, the Supremes.  Even though it was 'loosely based upon' these singers (and Motown), anyone who knows the story of the Supremes and Motown can see the parallels in this movie.<br /><br />The singing is incredible, as is the cinematography and showmanship.  The story is good and depicts what one might have expected to happen with the development and rise to stardom of the Supremes.<br /><br />But the most impressive part of the movie is the performance by Jennifer Hudson as Effie, a character which is 'loosely' based upon the late great Florence Ballard.  Hudson's vocals are truly exquisite and her part in the story is the crowning achievement of this movie (as it was in the musical).  I cannot think of a better performance than &#34;And I Am Telling You I Am Not Going&#34; in any movie musical I have ever seen.  It is riveting and makes you take a deep breath as you watch it.<br /><br />If you love Motown, especially the old songs, and if you saw Dreamgirls on broadway or in some other venue, I would advise you to see this movie, because it is great and will not disappoint.  If this is all new to you, I think you will enjoy the story and it might cause you to take some time to learn about the fabled history of this great music genre and music label.<br /><br />All around, this one is great!
B00455IVHU|5.0|I love this movie. It has been a long time favorite of mine for years. The interaction between Jeff and Barbra is great. So glad to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime. Enjoy!
B00632HWOG|2.0|this app keeps crashing and as far as I can see I am unable to turn off the notifications for every email.  its annoying .  ill probably end up uninstalling it.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|It is hands down the funniest show I have ever watched. Smart, witty and the Character of Sheldon is in a league of his own. Tremendous show.
0316204366|3.0|I must start by saying I am a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell. He is a great storyteller and I have found each of his previous books complling reads. However, I cannot say I felt the same way about &#34;David and Goliath&#34;. I was intrigued by the premise ... underdogs and upsets. The book, in my mind, did not fullfil it's promise. It's starts well but somewhere along the way Gladwell seems to lose focus. I had to force myself to finish it. Too bad .... disappointing. Gladwell has set the bar high and with this attempt he does not succeed.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|It is hands down the funniest show I have ever watched. Smart, witty and the Character of Sheldon is in a league of his own. Tremendous show.

B0058BI896|5.0|It is hands down the funniest show I have ever watched. Smart, witty and the Character of Sheldon is in a league of his own. Tremendous show.
B00AB55BS0|1.0|This show started with promise, as I'm a huge Sean Bean and medieval fan...but with an absolutely nauseating amount of gratuitous and unnecessary sex and gore, my opinion turned sour very quickly.<br />I don't consider myself high brow, but the sex and violence in this show for the most part is geared towards a simple-minded audience...which I'm not a grunting ape so I necessitate more than that.<br />Oh and lest I forget, I could overlook a bunch of the raunchy scenes if not for the unbelievably irritating character of Joffrey. That little puke completely ruins this show as I get so annoyed every time he's on screen that I grit my teeth and can't even watch.<br />By the 7th episode, I was done and sent back my unopened second season to Amazon.<br />Furthermore, Ned, his illegitimate son, and sword fighting daughter are the only likable characters. However, they get mucked over at every single turn with no repercussions...which I choose to voyeur into escapism in order to get away from injustice, not watch more of it.<br />I'm amazed at the high praise this trash gets, but I suppose it's a social commentary on what the current populous thinks is entertainment.<br />Sorry I wasted my time.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Well acted.  Leaves you on the edge of your seat. I enjoy the characters.  They really make this show work well.
B005K17RU0|1.0|No video or audio.  Just a bunch of numbers and statistics.  If we can't get some pictures and video of the weather in various parts of the country, what good is it.  I can see statistics on the local tv.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Lots of interesting info about running and diet integrated into a heartwarming story about real people.<br />Some very interesting reflections on cooperation and competition coexisting.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This is great. I have this installed on all of my devices and really can't remember life without it. I do wish there was a better way to take notes.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This is the season where Star Trek:TNG really took off in terms of storyline and character development.  The Blu Ray transfers seem to be pretty crisp;  I am watching on a large plasma and the colors really pop.  This is kind of remarkable considering the age of the shows (~20 years, give or take).  I would recommend waiting until this set is on sale - at least under $50, because it seems to regularly be in sale.  The only downside to this set is that they did not add in the much-anticipated Wesley death that the fans wanted.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! It was so good, i could have easily have read this in one night. Very hard to put down. I really didn't want this one to end.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of the best most creative books I have read. Beautifully written and a joy to read. I was left wanting more.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The book has some insight, but for the most part you may want to take what the author says with a grain of salt. No great enlightenment and not a complete waste of time either.
B008JDAC7G|2.0|not much fun--moved too fast, little explanation to get me involved in the game. deleted after about 15 minutes of play
B004Q3RMPS|5.0|Delicious cupcakes and cheesecake recipes, and Guinness chocolate cake was amazing - easy to make, and the result exceeded my expectations! Absolutely love this book!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great Movie. The blu-ray is superb. Watching it on my home theater screen is like being right there in the moment. The picture and sound are increadable.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|A real page turner!  Could have liked it better with a little less drug use and discussion.  Loved the art discussion.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great TV series. Just started watching it and made it to season 3, but so far every thing is good. It's great to see Peter Falk again in the role he was meant to play.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This British series is delightfully entertaining and very well done.  You get involved with the characters and feel like you know them.  I can't wait for next season to start.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love the 007 what can I say. I have all the 007 movies and this one lives up to the hype. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Not great literature, but an interesting concept and pretty well executed. It's actually ironic (read circular) that I am here writing a review and people read the review and rate it, then Amazon send me emails telling me that the review is helpful to someone. Sort of like something, uh, out of The Circle.....
149228856X|5.0|“With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to the truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two.”<br /><br />The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is R.L. Stevenson's highly acclaimed classic that first came out in 1886 and dealt with the split personality phenomenon. An instant hit, it has been adapted for TV, movies and on stage multiple times.<br /><br />Living in the Victorian era in England, Dr. Jekyll is a respected man held in high esteem<br />by his colleagues. He is also famous for hosting great dinners and for his gentlemanly ways. But what no one suspects is that Dr. Jekyll is also the mysterious and cruel, Mr. Hyde who had ruthlessly trampled a small girl once without any qualms!<br /><br />Mr. Utterson, a close friend as well as the attorney of Dr. Jekyll, is concerned about Dr. Jekyll's close companionship with Mr. Hyde and also worried about his safety. He suspects that Mr. Hyde is biding his time and planning to kill the doctor at the first chance that he gets. So it is Mr. Utterson who investigates the strange occurrences that start happening with Dr. Jekyll and the mysterious gaps in Mr. Hyde's sightings.<br /><br />As Mr. Utterson says when he decides to find all about Mr. Hyde.<br />&#34;If he be Mr. Hyde,&#34; he had thought, &#34;I shall be Mr. Seek.&#34;<br /><br />I still remember the first time that I read The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and the thrill I got after reading it, one would suspect that it would diminish the second time one reads the same book but that has not been the case with me. Howsoever times I read this book I feel the same excitement and the same chill. The effect that R.L. Stevenson produces on the readers has stood the test of time. The atmosphere is of secrecy, mystery and horror. There is a good man and a bad man. With nothing in common but yet they share such a friendship that the good man, Dr. Jekyll is averse to listening to anything foul about Mr. Hyde and is so inclined towards him that he evens pays off any problems that he might encounter like he signs the check to payoff the small girl's family after Mr. Hyde has trampled and injured the girl! But the same cannot be said for Mr. Hyde who is indifferent and uncaring towards everyone and everything. He has a craving for violence and has no patience for society norms.<br /><br />“Jekyll had more than a father's interest; Hyde had more than a son's indifference.”<br /><br />The story does not have many settings. Everything is either happening in the lab of Dr. Jekyll or through letters. There is no direct POVof Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll also only voices his perspectives at the very end. Anyone will think that this should dampen the appeal of the book where the main characters are for the most part in the background but no, the expertise and skill of the author in handling the streaming of the flow is admirable and he keeps the reader entranced the whole time. I was totally enchanted by the vivid descriptions of the Victorian London and the scenarios. Everything was happening like a movie playing in my mind and I could imagine myself walking beside Mr. Utterson when he first learns of Mr. Hyde or could definitely imagine myself looking up to see Dr. Jekyll sitting at his window looking pale and mysterious!<br /><br />A book that will enchant and give you nightmares. This is a story that debates the issues of suppressed desires and the belief that everyone is made up of a good part and a bad part. If the good and the bad are separated then what will happen? Will it always be like it was with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or is there another solution?<br /><br />The characters are sketched such that they remain with you long after you have finished the book. Dr. Jekyll is a gentleman and a highly acclaimed doctor. At first sight he is the perfect specimen of good breeding and high education but can we ever know anyone fully?<br /><br />Mr. Hyde is his dark side. A man with no conscience and an utter disregard for any rules of morality or society, he is man of high action and no consideration.<br /><br />“All human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone, in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.”<br /><br />Mr. Utterson is a serious man by all regards but also a loyal friend who is persistent in his actions to know the problems haunting Dr. Jekyll and help solve them. He is also very inquisitive and ready to take risks to quench his curiosity. His character also gives us a glimpse of duality where on one hand we have the serious and very professional attorney and on the other hand is the man ready to take risks and act on impulse.<br /><br />The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde makes the reader ponder and think about the scenarios where many a times a seemingly good person is accused and proven to be someone entirely different from his expected character where people often can be heard saying &#34;He was such a good man.I don't know how he could be a murderer?&#34; or &#34;She was so devoted, definitely didn't expect her to be capable of doing something like this!&#34;<br /><br />A story with multiple layers to it and many ways of taking the story. I give The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a shining 5 out of 5 and highly recommend this book to everyone. An unforgettable epic from R.L. Stevenson, this is not to be missed. :)<br /><br />“There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul.”<br /><br />This review is also available on the blog Njkinny's World of Books..od breeding and high education but can we ever know anyone fully?<br /><br />Mr. Hyde is his dark side. A man with no conscience and an utter disregard for any rules of morality or society, he is man of high action and no consideration.<br /><br />“All human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone, in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.”<br /><br />Mr. Utterson is a serious man by all regards but also a loyal friend who is persistent in his actions to know the problems haunting Dr. Jekyll and help solve them. He is also very inquisitive and ready to take risks to quench his curiosity. His character also gives us a glimpse of duality where on one hand we have the serious and very professional attorney and on the other hand is the man ready to take risks and act on impulse.<br /><br />The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde makes the reader ponder and think about the scenarios where many a times a seemingly good person is accused and proven to be someone entirely different from his expected character where people often can be heard saying &#34;He was such a good man.I don't know how he could be a murderer?&#34; or &#34;She was so devoted, definitely didn't expect her to be capable of doing something like this!&#34;<br /><br />A story with multiple layers to it and many ways of taking the story. I give The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a shining 5 out of 5 and highly recommend this book to everyone. An unforgettable epic from R.L. Stevenson, this is not to be missed. :)<br /><br />“There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul.”<br /><br />This review is also available on the blog Njkinny's World of Books..
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is awesome, my kind of action, great job Warner Bros. I can't stop playing because so engrossed and  ready to fight in the next level
B00008G7UF|5.0|Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are great! This is a wonderful, funny, romantic comedy! Concidered a &#34;Chick Flick&#34;, but my husband loves the movie. The story line and location blend perfectly. It is definately one to add to your collection if you enjoyed movies like, Sleepless in Seattle, Two Weeks Notice, The Proposal, Maid in Manhattan.
B000683VI4|5.0|I consider this to be the best love story ever !  I highly recommend watching this with your favorite significant other ....
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This album delivered the old style of Rap Eminem got big on while also bringing his skills to a new level.  This album IS EXTREMELY VULGAR, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC, and OFFENSIVE, but that's why we love Eminem.  If you liked the original Marshall Mathers LP, pick this one up at least for nostalgia purposes.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is my favorite keyboard, period.  Too bad that they do not have this for iphone.<br /><br />It literally saves a lot of typing as it suggests the next word in the sequence.  So if you frequently type a certain phrase, it pops up in that sequence.  Great stuff.  Miss it.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|I haven't even played this yet and I'm already loving it!!<br />WHOEVER MADE THIS GAME KEEP MAKING MORE GAMES LIKE!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love it. Wish it had been around for my oldest son who loved his binkie. I'm buying them for all my prego friends.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Michael Connolly is as good as James Patterson in my opinion.both are superb. Keeps you page turning.<br />Don't want to ever reach the end if the book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It didn't blow my mind like The Kite Runner. Still such an amazing author with a way with words.  Long book, many characters to track.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This little game is a lot of fun. I happened upon it when it was free, but when I showed it to a friend of mine, he bought it and absolutely loves it. It's not Kerbal Space Program, but Kerbal doesn't run on Android (yet?). The developer recommends Kerbal for playing on the PC.
B006ISJQBM|4.0|clear example of exploitation politics and money<br />a proud people PR have managed to hold on to their land in general
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved this series when it was on MTV. I downloaded it to my net book so I can watch it when I travel.
0439023521|5.0|Amazing book and so glad that I read this book before I watched the movie. Read all 3 books and this whole trilogy is worth reading!
B001RP1G0U|5.0|Warm, funny, heartfelt, and a Newfie.  And never a dull moment. Perfect for a cold winter evening of snuggling by the fire.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|figuring out tricks and controls is challenging @ first; once you get the hang of it the game gets repetitive.  over all - good game, fun graphics, wonky physics... and the everpresent obnoxious game music track. solid 4/5 stars.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Exactly what it says on the package... fun little freecell app. Having fun trying to get all of the achievements.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  A friend recommended it and I had no idea what it was about. It pulled me in immediately!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Great Story a nd I really enjoyed the book. I would highly 're commend the book, a good read.<br />Tell a friend.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|this is rated pg13-it is too dumb for anyone over 13. another reason the country is becoming a has been.
B000063Y8F|5.0|This is the best kitchen investment I've made. I looked around, tried several presses, and ended up settling on this one as &#34;the best&#34;. It works great, with garlic, and so-so with (old) ginger root (need to slice the ginger into thin slices, to get it to work best (or use younger ginger).
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|This is one of my 10 favorite movies.  I lack &#34;critical&#34; talent, although here's what I like best:  James Cromwell is an award-worthy bad guy.  Want to be scared? Watch the kitchen scene with Cromwell and Spacey. If there were a category for best portrayal of a socio-path, Cromwell's character wins hands down.  I love to contrast film roles actors play, and for Cromwell it's Captain Smith in LA Confidential with the Farmer in Babe.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy set up, but be patient as it takes a while to tune in to the wireless signal.  Excellent picture and ease of use.  So glad I have it.  I am &#34;casting&#34; (aka streaming) Netflix, You Tube and soon, Hulu, with great results.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|So funny, and Jen Aniston, very hot. Especially funny at the end. The gag real has a very classic moment.
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|this book was an interesting book. I understand it , I recommend this book to those who want to read more, to build their vocabulary.
B000002LLC|5.0|One of the best soundtracks ever. Overall not a huge Madonna fan, but this has to be her best work....there isn't a single song on this album that I don't like and that is rare!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I love this series and sad to see it end..but wow what an ending.its a must read series with everything in it, love and devotion, adventure and excitement, evil and good, and with a little humor.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|We laughed so hard we cried.  A must see for any science fiction or comic-book enthusiast!  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are genius.  And Jason Bateman is seriously hot.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|this game is awesome because you get to downloed music and you get to unlock instraments. this piano game is so cool. if you are bord get this game It will make your life fun. get this game
B000001F6A|5.0|This recording is in the measure of Gods Goodness.  It is the idea of his beauty and those trying to destroy it and why people should fight for it to the Death.  I am happy for their ideas and I want to keep them forever.  The Moody Blues
B00E0SX118|5.0|This is a great family movie funny and enjoyable. kids will watch it over and over. Mom and Dad will love it to.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|It was a great show.  I have loved Dr. Who from the glimpses of it I got when I was a teen in the 80's and saw it on the PBS channel. I look forward to seeing how things will continue from here.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|What superlative's can I add to, wonderful, great shows, and nostalgic as all get out, absolutely love it, especially all the old stars.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|This is a revealing book. It is not as much about a narcissistic mother, as it is about what happens to the child of a narcissist (whose other parent is a sociopath). Sachi Parker openly shares her self-doubts and her seemingly insurmountable obstacles throughout life. It's both a sad and predictable journey of failure for the lost child of narcissism.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Excellent, Self confessed Trekky I guess but I do like this movie, at least as good as the last one and the special effects are great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I listen and read along.  It is like reading the Bible twice.  Somehow to hear someone speak the Word seems to help my understanding better.  I recommend the app.,going to Church, loving God and your neighbor as yourself.
B00499NHLC|2.0|It is an interesting portrayal, but as a caraciture of Holmes, defining him as an odd-ball and intellectual freak which is not true for Conan Doyle's character. Doyle presented the power of the inductive process which is so important in problem-solving.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, no matter how frustrating it is. My problem with it is that it doesn't update in a timely manner when new levels are added.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Loved the relationship between Enzo and his family. Especially between him and Danny. Very heart warming and inspiring. Definitely recommend for dog and racing lovers.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Very inspirational. One person is an invalid the other a thief. The movie shows how both people helped each other and that everyone has value as a person.
B000TDGGVU|5.0|Aside from giving fascinating theoretical explanations to human behavior in multi-choice environment this book provides great tips for handling complex scenario which practically 'makes life easier'.<br />Loved it!
B002ZG99NG|5.0|shopping for this was easy and merchandise came with a great price  deliver was fast and as promised overall was a great transaction
B007REV4YI|3.0|My son bought this to watch with his granddad since he is ill and couldn't go to the movies to see it. They enjoyed it since it came with both blu-ray and dvd.  It has alot of extras including the making of the movies. He gave his granddad the dvd and kep the blue-ray for himself.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love it! It was action packed and your emotions took a roller coaster ride with all the unexpected turns and twist.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I've never read a book with such a unique perspective and style. Even when death revealed the ending I needed to find out more. So very glad I read this instead of letting the movie ruin the imagery.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|For only two dollars this is a good match three game. Has a little story line to keep you involved.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A well written, engrossing read. Great story. Great characters. Really enjoyed this one. Some of the references to 80s pop culture were a bit out of my personal knowledge base. However, I can see how someone who grew up in, came of age in, or just loved the 80s would absolutely love the references, connections, riddles, and plot points that revolve around the decade.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For decades. Literally decades. Even though in the late seventies and early eighties, Stephen King was one of my favorite authors. Certainly my favorite horror novelist.<br />So I'm talking The Shining, The Stand, Salem's Lot.<br />He started losing me with \\"It\\". \\"It\\"wasn't my taste. I  very loyally kept reading his books, and then one day I just gave up. It wasn't worth my time or money.<br />Every few years someone would recommend a King novel, and I'd try, and then fail to like it.<br />Along came \\"Under the Dome\\". I read three or four chapters, and just gave up ,I was tired of juggling the characters who all seemed snarky and one dimensional. That book is the one book out of the tens of thousands of  books I've read over the last forty something years, that I skipped and read the end, then took it back to the library, feeling somewhat guilty.<br /><br />Along comes 11/22/63 and Doctor Sleep. And I love them both.<br />So good job, Mr K.<br />Keep up the good work!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't care for this game.  i think it should be banned for anyone with a life.  i really do
B003TQ50V6|5.0|This is one of the all-time great westerns, in the old tradition.  Acting is superb, story gripping, and music beautiful.  I, for one, never tire of watching it to see the good guys win.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Still the best there is, an ever was. I will buy his albums until he makes me stop, great record, I highly recommend it.
B0029VUV70|4.0|The acting of Kate Winslet, in particular, was outstanding. Also, it was interesting to see how far a person will go to protect a secret.  I guess the only reason the young man did not catch on sooner was due to his youth as well as the thrill of a sexual experience.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Jumped around. Disappointing end.  Could have done soooo much more with these wonderful characters! Can't think of 6 more disappointing words
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I really don't find many movies to be that funny. I go to movies for dramas and character studies mostly. But 21 Jump Street is so goofy I've seen it in theaters and purchased a DVD copy. Highly recommended.<br />I laugh my butt off.
B00C5R8364|3.0|Not up to quality of Pillars of the Earth but worth reading.  A spy type thriller like he has written before.
B00EK3EFEA|5.0|Wonderfull album. Very different from the first debut album but this one shows how talented Diane Birch is by imspired from different sounds from the 70s and shake the all thing in her soice (french expression sorry ^^') Love it go ahead you won't be disapointed =D
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am now a gamer because of  this game it is not bad I think everybody will like it it's not that bad I wish you could update it to a newer version though
B00FLDG52I|5.0|I love Eric Clapton and I am glad there are enough performances by him.  The DVD has great music and musicians. I have had an earlier concert DVD of the Crossroads concert, but I feel this one is better period.  You receive hours of live music. Nice to see some of the greats like Taj Mahal. John Mayer does  &#34;Queen of California&#34; what a wonderful voice he has. Some of the better country singers Keith Urban and Vince Gill do a wonderful rendition of Tumbling Dice. This is a recommended concert DVD.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book for everyone to read, especially if you want to teach kids about empathy and kindness
B00BHJ0MY2|4.0|Great African music from Mali. I never bought any of her music before, But I love trying new African music and its thoroughly enjoyable. The words are supplied in French and English. My favorite is the first song Lalla.
B00EFFVZIM|5.0|Great music . this  band has a great sound and catchy lyrics . Even my daughters who are loyal to One Direction like it .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging and fun! keeps your mind active.. play with ur kid, hubby or friend and have fun escaping together. great game!
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Great music, from the early days.  5 stars compared to anything else by anyone else, but 4 stars compared to them.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I haven't had any trouble with the app triggering my anti virus<br />Program here on my kindle, but this is about the 4th or 5th time<br />I have had to download this app. (Which may indicate a virus of<br />Some type), because for some reason the app keeps removing<br />Itself from my device.<br />At first it ran great, no problems at all and then after a update I<br />Guess it started removing itself and every time I want to watch<br />you tube videos I have to download it completely (meaning it's<br />Not on my device or even in my cloud) again.<br /><br />I hope the authors read these reviews and fix the problem or I<br />Will have to switch to something else (and their is a lot to choose<br />From out there), but I really like the option of watching or down<br />Loading to my device.<br />Zm
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|When I was you my mother took me to My Fair Lady in the theatres. I loved it!  When my daughter was very young I used to watch My Fair Lady and she was so excited to watch it. It was VHS in those days and when it was on DVD I bought it.  it was watched a lot. My mother is in a geriatric hospital an I bought them a DVD; they enjoy the movie so much it watched very often. My daughter was jealous, that I had to buy her one for our holidays.  She was so thrilled.  This movie is a classic and doesn't age!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love the game! Watch the money you spend and try not to spend any unless you have to. You will need it later on.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Not really to much needed to be said,  the colors are amazing, the movie is obviously a classic.  Very happy with this purchase, and you really will be also.  Don't settle for DVD quality with these movies as the Blu-ray is 100 times better and worth it (if you as me...which you kind of are...).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I luv this game me and my brother spent an hour on playing this.  That's how awesome this game is.  I really think should buy this app.U will luv it if u don't get this app u will feel so let down.  It's a better game then temple run 1 &amp; 2.Get it u will LUV IT!
B00C7607FS|5.0|Its absolutely amazing how much better the Blu-ray quality is in comparison to DVD.  The colors are amazing.  We purchased the DVD format of the Little Mermaid, and had a couple of other movies in Blu-ray.  After seeing the difference, we decided to get the Little Mermaid Blu-ray...We are extremely happy!!  The colors are amazing.  If you can afford a little extra...its worth the Blu-ray quality.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book!! GRISHAM got back to his style and the book was great. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book, I really did. It was well written, and it made me both laugh and cry. But being close to Hazel' s age myself, I didn't appreciate Mr. Green' s use of language to make the teens sound more authentic. Every other paragraph, it seemed, was filled with swear words. There's also a intense make out scene that was quite blush-worthy. Hazel also states a disbelief in God, (though Agustus tells her otherwise). So, if you're looking for an innocent read, this  might not be it. Still, I did enjoy the details Mr. Green packed the book with, and the calmness with which he writes the most dramatic scenes, making them feel even more intense. It reminded me of Gone With The Wind meets Romeo and Juliet.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|The movie is awesome, it was in perfect shape, and it only took a week! :) It was perfect for my boyfriend's early Christmas present!
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Brilliant, classic movie that I watch over and over.  The soundtrack alone is worth the admission.  Well written, funny and strange make a great combination here.  I swear I pick up something new each time I view it.  Highly recommended.
B00E0OK2X2|5.0|I liked the game it is so cool and the graphics are awesome  it's pretty challenging and it is worth getting.
1451695195|3.0|This book gives an entirely different perspective on &#34;heaven.&#34;  Dr. Alexander had a unique experience that was hard for me to relate to, as it was so different from all the other books I've read on people's experiences in heaven.  I'm glad I read it, but wouldn't read it again.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|great movie..kids love the action..would see it over and over ...this book came to life for all of my kids ..
B0028MBKVG|5.0|An excellent book that makes you crave your next run. This book has inspired me to aim for ultra running.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting and outstanding set design are in every episode. A true pleasure to watch. We can't wait for the next one.
B002VJ0576|2.0|We'll, this is dreadful. The only real question is whether it is so bad that it is worth watching. On this I am ambivalent. As a long term Sherlockian, I must admit that I was so appalled by the so-called plot,and the terrible acting in the titular role, and the disrespect for the character. (At one point Holmes is referred to by his alleged first name, &#34; Robert&#34; ) that  I found it amusing.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Ever since this movie came out in the theaters I wanted to watch it but I never got the chance to and when I bought it here on Amazon I was more than happy to see it because I love Brad Pitt movies. You will cry watching this movie best movie ever and the saddest as well. Recommend this seller and it was at a great price and even though it was used it was not scratched at all .
B003UESJFQ|3.0|Not as good as I was hoping it would be.  It's a good premise, but I thought the lead actress was a little weak.  Could have been better in my opinion.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Why I choose this rating is because I love any kind of comedy and I love the actors in this movies and its hilarious!!!!Definitely would Recommend!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game passes the time im always playing every chance i get also love how they keep going instead of ending
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent piece of kit. Never had a single problem with the free v version and when the pro version came o out as f free app of the day I jumped at it . Well worth the small cost of only to let you know how much charge you have left.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game it's my favorite I am almost to the great white!!!! I highly recommend me and my friends love it!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|It's a little confusing in the beginning as to how to acquire gems.  A tutorial at the first would be helpful.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show is absolutely good and creepy! I would recommend this show to anyone who loves a good scary movie.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|The Cousteau family has been a favorite since the National Geographic specials of my childhood. I am a scuba diver and naturalist because of the awesome underwater world Jacques Cousteau introduced to me!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like this on kindle so much better than my cell phone! Appreciate the 5 life limit, makes me take a break and do other things. Great entertainment. Very addictive.
B000I9TYIW|5.0|I had a bit of an obsession with James Woods as I was getting movies and then I found a clip in which he is fully naked. Yes. Naked. So...with the knowledge I'll be sounding like a pervert, I got this movie just to see the whole clip and then on the way, I was cast into a Twilight Zone typical movie that made me wonder just what was real and what wasn't. It's an interesting movie in which Wood's character is showing soft to hard pornography on his channels....after that, well, I can only assume it's because of that, when the movie becomes a little over the top from reality. Guess this is what happens when you're a couch potato and a porn addict. Not sure.
B00B3VB9TQ|2.0|Unfortunately not engaging in the slightest... :/ Admittedly I only read about 3 quarters of the book before I permenantly put it down. It was a little bit messy and erratic for my taste, but of course this is just my opinion.
B001I189MQ|5.0|I have two of the same DVDs, and now I have it on my computer. I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I can't say anything that other reviews haven't already covered, but for hoots and giggles, I will. First, I loved Heath Ledger in this movie. Maybe it's because he  was one of the most blossoming talented actors (RIP) or it could be my 'slight' obsession with the Joker, and equal obsession with the Batman. NONE THE LESS, even as I watched it several hundred times on my television or on my computer, Joker scares and thrills me all the same. The movie still makes me cringe when (SPOILERS) Rachel dies--For some reason, I still never expect it to happen.<br />Aaron Eckhart's performance was mind-blowing, and who can forget that guttural drawl from Batman. But the thing that really makes this movie blow the waters from the sea is the Joker. This whole movie is a mind f**** between switching addresses, attempted murder of the mayor, and other goodies. This is my favorite of Nolan's trilogy, and will always be.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Mockingjay was slight anticlimax to the otherwise brilliant series. This book felt a little rushed, however the plot was splendid!
B0046UBPG8|5.0|Moore, a beautiful red-head. Mark Ruffalo, a sexy actor whose sexual appeal is almost a defiance to humanity in this movie. Josh Hutcherson (Hunger Games star). I watched this movie for mainly these three people but then I found out that the girl that played Alice in &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; is in this too! All of them are beautiful actors in the dramatic film of a lesbian couple who work hard to raise their son and daughter. When the children seek their sperm donor (birth father), a few curves are made in this tale of drama, heart break, and lapsing love. True love, in no matter circumstance, can be replenished even when it seemed completely broken. :)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|pines and the wayward pines were very hard to put down. I cannot wait for the third one to come out. its almost like a twilight zone story. i recommend this to everyone.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Where do I start, this movie was a bigger waste of live then &#34;Olympus Has Fallen&#34;. Another dumb movie where the good guy gets his face kicked in the entire time. So cheasy! &#34;I'm sorry sir but I think he is kinda hot&#34;....WTF! I felt like I was watching Independence Day for a minute. And why does this movie have to Superman, cause thats apparently what Zod was. The original version was so much better. This movie uses special affects to cover up for a poor production.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|It started out awesome.....caught my interest right away.....about 65% into it....i LOST interest, in my opinion it got very draggy and boring....more and more depressing as it goes along...i kept saying, ok move it along will you....i do not recommend
B005PK56TA|5.0|Just discovered this show (during the third season) Was so happy to find the first series here.  Great series !!!  Really enjoyed this one from start to finish
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Read this when it first came out...Where to begin...Fifty Ugh...what a ride. LOVED everything about it...2015 can't come fast enough.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much I would go to bed playing  it I think that you should get this you need to get this  I would come home from school and play this with my sister
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED the book and everything about it, much more softer this one...loving the cast so far...can't wait, hoping sooner then promised.
1465414444|5.0|For a fan of WOW like me, this is the ultimate perfect gift besides purchasing a membership for that person to give this holiday season. The pictures just jump off the pages. I was familiar with all of the characters in this book. I have seen them through my many travels in the WOW world.<br /><br />What I was not so familiar with was the history of the different continents or how the characters came to be. This I found the most fascinating. This is a coffee table book but you might want to pick up two copies. One to keep on your bookshelf and one to keep on your coffee table for your friends of WOW to be jealous of and talk about.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read it a while ago and thought i had posted my review on here...LOVED LOVED LOVED the book and everything about it...and now we have a producer for Fifty...can't wait for the movie, not soon enough.
B000001ESN|5.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about with MOFL remasters vs. 1997  vs. 1980 releases...blah blah blah...<br /> I did a Lo-Fi and a Hi-Fi A & B comparison between the 1980 and 1997 versions. What a difference! I'm a musician with picky tastes and have mid-range stereo equipment and I love the 1997 Remaster!<br /> Buy It!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Extremely historical!  If you love America and appreciate its beginning then you will love this film.  Acting is good.  After watching this film, I went to my encyclopedia and read about John Adams.  Except for some time differences in his European assignments, the movie was spot- on for historical accuracy.  My sorrow is that modern day America does not have the patriots in in that were there at the founding of our nation!
B002F3BP8Q|5.0|Let me tell you..if you haven't heard this Expanded Edition of Love...You've never heard it! I was always indifferent in the past towards this release due to the lack of sonic quality. Great remaster with a nice, fluffy, thumping bass drum and low end.<br /> Amazing difference compared to original release.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A real classic in our new world. This is original, pure and genius. Was so glad I moved beyond my usual brain candy.
B003U0I9U0|5.0|Unbelievable modern sounding remaster with perfect balance and no compression. It's hard to please everyone with \\"Best-Of\\" compilations, but you can't complain with this line-up. The emotion-infused music of A-Ha finally shines through with<br />this great remaster. What a stunning legacy for such a heart-felt group of musicians.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love all the different options, I use it everyday to either help me focus at work or to fall asleep. Probably the most used app on my Kindle.
0060566108|1.0|Another book of white elephant ideas just twisted another way to sell a book and make some cash! The ideas aren't bad, but nothing really new.
147676459X|5.0|It's absolutely fabulous. I laughed so hard I cried. I highly recommend it to any Hyperbole & a Half fan, or anyone that loves to hear tales from other peoples' lives.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Great music that lives on and on, if only today's musicians could produce music like this. Todays stars don't shine like the stars of old!!!!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have yet to read a bad Pendergast book.  There was one weak one on a ship, but no bad ones.  I recommend reading from book one.  You've never met a more interesting character!
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|This is a great reproduction of a great movie that is well worth the purchase. Watch the old version first then follow up with this one to see how todays technology really makes a difference.
B000FBJAF0|5.0|The best thing he as written in years as far as action and suspense is concerned.  This will completely hold your interest while you also learn a lot of Viet Nam history.  I highly recommend!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Fun story, easy read, that makes you think about how people are so open to share their lives with everyone compared to even 15 years ago.<br /><br />Eggers had (has?) a clunky, choppy writing style.  Everyone seemed to talk alike - lots of \\"I did\\", \\"I will\\", \\"I do\\" answers to big preachy statements.  Because people were so agreeable I thought there were drugs in the water :)<br /><br />Strange how hardly anyone really questioned what the Circle was doing with privacy.  I would have liked to see more conflict and opposition privacy groups fighting back.  It seemed everyone except Mae's ex was on board.<br /><br />Part 3, after Mae made her final decision should have been more than a quick summary.  I would have liked to see how things were working out long term.  Perhaps there is a sequel on tap?
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Hours of fun hard to put down only down side running of life's to fast on hunts other then that great game love it
B005EGXNLS|5.0|This story of the beginning of Edward's reign after the death of his father, Alfred the Great, is a tale you have to hang on and ride through to the end.  The main character is a mix of Saxon and Dane who you will cheer and worry over.  A great historical novel of Angle-Saxon Danish times.  Well proofed and I will be looking for others in the series.
B00DNB9RXO|4.0|Refreshingly new and Unique style where you guide a Cat through something like a Maze of Underground Tunnels that have many Obstacles and Hazards along the way.  You select Controls you like best: TILT Control, left and right Button controls or DRAG screen left and right to control.  You constantly Rotate the screen to allow the Cat to travel through the Tunnels to Picks up Items and get to end of each Level Safely.  The use of Smooth movements, Realistic Physics and Gravity make Naught Delightfully Challenging.  It can be tough and takes some practice to develope proper Control Accuracy and game Strategies.  If you like Maze Puzzles and Physics games, you may Love this one.<br /><br />It has it's own unique style that makes it Interesting and Engaging.  The Artwork is exceptional, game play is very Smooth and Choice of 3 different types of Controls make this a Refreshingly new way to challenge yourself.  A well designed app with No Intrusive Addons or other annoyances.  It will also play properly with WiFi OFF.  I find it Enjoyable and a Worthy Challenger for your brain and Dexterity with controls.  The only bug is that the EXIT Button but does not close it entirely so you have to use a Task Killer app to Close it completely if you want to.  Not a big issue but enough to deduct 1 Star on review.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I say about Facebook - millions love this wonderful<br />way of keeping in touch with family and friends.  Finding<br />friends that you have lost touch through the years.  It keeps<br />you informed with funny things and sometimes sad things.<br />I can talk to my family every day.  Thanks Facebook
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|We finally got this game on Kindle. I have so much fun playing. I love the challenge and the competition among my friends for high score. Helping my friends get farther is great too.

B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|I have read all of 4 books concerning the Hobbits. Not very happy that this movie is in three parts. The Lord of the Rings trilogy was just fine. I'm thinking some one just extended this for the money.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Excellent story line - full of surprises and chills - excellent acting all the way around - Jessica Lange is incredible!!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Loved the first Rambo movie best. The portrayal of a Nam vet trying to fit back into normal life but still shunned by society was very close to actual events.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved the storyline, disappointed in the ending, thus giving it 3&#34;stars. Not worth the money I paid for since the ending left me scratching my head wondering &#34;why?&#34;...&#34;really?&#34;...&#34;oh brother!&#34;
B00DW475CC|5.0|I just enjoy this movie due to it's Christmas theme. Very good in HD. Crisp images. Also wanted to do away with the old container.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|Such a hilarious family friendly movie everyone can enjoy. We all loved it, Dad, Mom and Kids! We rented it, but it's one I'll be buying for sure!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This story has been around for many generations and I'm sure it will be around for many more. It is a great story to read if you love adventure.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|Warning: some spoilers follow, but are necessary to explain my review.<br /><br />This movie seems to have a very narrow age range in mind: kids aged between seven and ten years old.  Kids aged under about six years old will not understand much of this movie, which has a complicated plot and lots of it uses concepts they won't understand (sabotage, commercial sponsorship, running out of fuel over the ocean, Dusty's mentor lying to him until he discovers the truth, two henchmen planes that harass Dusty).  There is also a few scary scenes: when a Navy fighter squadron of talking planes dives on warships and gets completely blown out of the sky and when Rusty flies through an open-ocean storm wave and cripples his propeller before apparently drowning in the dark.  Kids older than ten will become bored, because of the attempt to convey too many sub-plots.  I was also slightly offended by the El Chupacabra character with his strong stereotypes of Mexican wrestlers (&#34;I swish my cape at you… Now you are shamed&#34;) and his romancing of one of female &#34;exotic&#34; planes.<br /><br />On the plus side, the plane designs are charming and I'm sure the toys will sell well.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors but her Scarpetta series is one of the best I have ever read I started with book one and have read every one since. I look forward to the next book.
B005QYKE2Y|2.0|This movie started off with a close-up of the female lead's behind, and what followed was a mixture of gratuitous female model extras, robot-on-human violence, and brutal robot violence.  For fans of the original Transformers cartoon series, it was shocking to see so many humans running for their lives only to be exploded into debris, falling to their deaths, or crushed by the Decepticons.  Many of the Autobots and Decepticons also mean gruesome deaths by being shot multiple times while lying on the ground, disarmed (literally), decapitated (frequently), and torn apart (for minor hench-robots).  It was also difficult at times to distinguish which sides the robots were on, since they don't have the old-school Autobot or Decepticon logos on their chests.  I could not understand the motives behind the Director of National Intelligence woman nor the official who ends up in a wheelchair, because they seemed to only lead to cost taxpayers billions of dollars without any repercussions.  It also seemed illogical to me that military squads who knew they were going up against an army of evil robots would bring assault rifles with bullets that bounced off their targets (unless scoring an eye-penetrating headshot), and only one anti-tank rocket.
B00G91Z8AQ|2.0|I'm a total sucker for DC and Marvel movies. This was not good.<br /><br />It felt like they took random elements from the recent reboots of Star Trek, Thor, and Clash of the Titans. And those elements were thrown together and executed very poorly. What you get is a sloppy story line with characters I absolutely did not care about. Henry Cavill looks the part, but his dialogue is awful. When he's in the suit they put entirely too much makeup on his face. This makes it feel like a daytime soap actor thrown into a major motion picture. I was not feeling Amy Adams as Lois Lane at all. Michael Shannon (Zod) has way more potential as an actor than what the writers gave to him.<br /><br />There is not nearly enough action sequences to save it. Some of the reviews here rave about the action and scenery. I feel like I watched a completely different movie. There's nothing new here that we haven't seen from the other franchises in recent years.<br /><br />I can not recommend this movie. My advice to a Superman fan would be to go rewatch Superman II. It has some 80's cheesiness but a lot more charm with a fantastic musical score. If I'm comparing it to anything that's similar and recent, Thor is superior in every single way.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies ever. These are the great songs of the Beatles, but not over played songs. Everything about this movie is great, actors,music, and I can't believe I am saying this but the choreography is fantastic. I've never noticed choreography in movies before but this jumps off the screen. I buy this movie on every device I have, even new devices.....it's that good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really awesome!!! why it is awesome is cause the horse looks like a real one and you have to take care of it like a real horse
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Mostly works well.  Having trouble connecting with FB and figuring out how to invite friends. Also, the graphics can be &quot;jerky&quot; at times. Good game even so
0060936223|5.0|The book was chosen for my book club.  I have not listened to Patti Smith's music but my sons have and they like her.  I loved her writing and her poems.  I was surprised to hear how she and her artist friends lived so frugally--they were poor!  I couldn't get over how each &#34;lived their art&#34; and how they grew and expanded and got better and better.  An insightful book.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|The concept of the plot. was interesting, but I don't like the style of writing,The narrative style made the narrator seem emotionally detached. I couldn't get emotionally involved. I flipped through the pages to finish it because I want to tell my friends about it and I want to see the movie.
B00280LYIC|1.0|Okay, so it was a good  book. The problem I had was that there were mistakes that easily could've been avoided. Some made up points in the book have influenced what people think they know about Greek mythology. Good story, I guess.

B001P4ESGC|5.0|Love this series.  Every episode is better than the last.  Leaves you always wondering who is going to turn bad next.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Did I buy this? Not at all my style so don't know how it happens that you want me to review it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great book for all ages. As a \\"Nana\\" to two Grandchildren it reminded me how I can possibly help be a good influence to them...to help them become caring individuals. This book demonstrates how \\"perceptions\\" are so important in life and how adults can be very influential in shaping how children perceive others.
B0040I09RM|4.0|The first couple episodes were a little rough. We're at the end of the first season and can't wait to watch the second.
0062060554|4.0|Having a grandmother with dementia, I have been curious about what it would be like to not remember everything.  On the surface it would be awful.  You forget who your loved ones are and the cherished memories disappear forever.  However, there are some benefits.<br /><br />My grandmother went through some traumatic events and they never left her mind, causing her to be depressed or angry at times.  It was like a wound that never fully heals.  But when the dementia finally took over, those painful memories were wiped out.  She may not remember who I am or the happy events of her life, but she is the happiest I've ever known her, free from the burdens of horrible recollections she's been saddled with her whole life.<br /><br />Although this book is about amnesia, it also explores the idea of what it would be like if you couldn't remember you past and had to rely on others memories.  It would be a helpless position and you'd be forced to believe that everyone was honest or else face the consequence that you'd end up completely paranoid about always being deceived.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to anyone looking for an easy, suspenseful novel that explores an interesting topic.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Season five is a must after viewing the previous four.  It follows well and the scripts are a nice mix of murder, potential matrimony, and comedy.  I loved the lead man in \\"Serenity\\" and now seeing him as a different character is interesting.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Well written and beautiful story! Sadly much of her story is the sad state of affairs in INDIA. I am looking forward to the movie.
B004SRNH10|1.0|I'd give it zero if that was an option. Didn't work for me. Downloaded for an app I was trying to use. Total waste of time.
B0052GACNM|4.0|This was a very good latter day project for the great Tony Bennett, and it's my second favorite of the three &#34;Duets&#34; discs, although all three are good.  It reminds me a bit of Sinatra's &#34;Duets&#34; series which many veteran artists are trying their own versions of these days.
B004M3GDI4|4.0|This is heavy, but it is a great head lamp.  Excellent adjustment, great variety of light options.  Highly recommend this headlamp.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great thinking type game.I love games that make me use my brain.Not only a card game but a strategy game as well.<br />Hope this type of thinking game is going to be made by this developer.I love the fact that if I get interrupted while playing I can come back later from where I left it.I can play this at work on my break,but some days I get interrupted and its great that I can come back and not loose progress.gamer mom.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Great App, I got it as the FAOTD.  Takes a little to understand the play, but it picks up, could mix of strategy checked with luck of the draw.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Outstanding performances, good music, great lyrics.  I only just recently &#34;discovered&#34; her.  As a friend of mine observed, &#34;plus, she's hot&#34;.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I was hooked after the first episode! So many of my friends are fans and now I can see why.
B000063UR1|4.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater in the early 70s, though it was one of those that a male at that time and age shouldn't actually admit to liking.  But I did, and have wanted to own a copy for years.  This video meets all expectations, but I admit, it's not quite as good as my memory of it is. (and I've watched it twice since this arrived...the first time she fell asleep, but the second time she fell asleep, I went ahead and watched it to the end). Still a good movie, with Joan Baez's vocals, and it was fun watching my younger wife watch it, wondering who that actor (Bruce Dern) is!  She also didn't know of Donald Southerland in MASH, as she was only familiar with Kiefer in 24, and was confused about which one was Spencer Tracy in Adam's Rib. She's so wonderful!
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|Wonderful album; brings back a lot memories from the 1970's; the was one of the first LP's that I bought as a teenager; some of the songs I believe were recorded in the Seattle (where I'm from), in the old Kingdome.
0345803485|5.0|I am reading it now. It is hard to put down. I bought it for my mother-in-law but she's not getting it till I'm finished. It has spiced up our love life. We have been reading it together. Can't wait to get the other books written by E.L. James.
B00594XOZU|5.0|If you're having trouble logging in and getting error messages try uninstalling and then reinstalling the app. Worked for me.
B00G3Q6VPS|3.0|The first two singles for Britney Jean (the hot mess EDM lead single, “Work Bitch”, where Britney talks in a clipped British accent over a pulsating beat, and “Perfume”, a ballad about leaving her scent all over her wandering man) left a lot to be desired & the early reviews for the album were mixed at best, so I was expecting the worst when I received my copy, but as it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised by this album. It’s not even close to being Spears’ best work (“In the Zone” takes that title), but it’s a solid effort nonetheless.<br /><br />The album is one big EDM fest where Spears primarily sings (or tries to, rather) about what she knows best: Dancing (“Bodyache”), boys (“It Should be Easy” featuring Will.I.Am, who executive produced the album), and sex (“Tik Tik Boom” featuring T.I.). Every now and then, Brit shows her range by singing about feeling lost (“Alien”) & hanging with her kid sister (“Chillin’ With You” featuring Jamie Lynn Spears), but don’t look for anything too deep here, because despite what Spears claims, this is hardly her most personal work. This album is meant for clubs of the night & health variety. And that’s not a bad thing at all. Just like we need deep, introspective music to move us emotionally & make us think, we need fun music to make us move physically and help us get our groove on.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have about the album (other than the first two singles) are Spears’ vocals. She’s never been a powerhouse vocalist, but she’s always managed to be solid & sound good, at least on her recordings, but on Britney Jean, we hear her struggling to hit her notes (it’s most notable on “Perfume”), seemingly even getting assistance for hitting the high notes on some songs (“Passenger”, an electro rock song about her trusting a lover & letting him lead for the first time), and her voice is dripping in effects on every song. I wonder what happened to her voice. She used to be pretty good before her third album, Britney, and was very good before she landed her record deal with Jive.<br /><br />Best songs:<br /><br />&#34;It Should Be Easy&#34;, featuring Will.I.Am - a mid tempo about how love should be easy, painless, & uncomplicated.<br /><br />&#34;Tik Tik Boom&#34; featuring T.I. - a nice uptempo with urban influences about sex<br /><br />&#34;Bodyache&#34; - a bouncy uptempo about dancing and boys.<br /><br />Worst Songs:<br /><br />&#34;Work Bitch&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Perfume&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Now That I Found You&#34; - on the deluxe edition. A ballad about finding true love. It’s not bad, but it sounds too childish and too 90s. Doesn’t mess well with the other tracks.<br /><br />All in all, a solid, but not amazing effort. 6/10.
B000FC146C|5.0|I liked the setting and the characters.  Learned a lot about  Australia country and its a story abut a priest and a family.  He takes time to talk to the youngest daughter of the family and then gets involved with her when she is grown.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I enjoy the actors and actresses, but it moves a little too slowly for my taste. I'll continue watching it.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I never know what to expect. I love most of the Jack Reacher books but have found a couple to be boring. loved this one! Plenty of action and suspense.
B008MM9630|4.0|See above just started but so far fun. Wish it had a few more instructions as not sure how to expand my prop or search outside my square.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|The perfect movie....no one has come up with a better one since this was made.  No one thought they were making history in the 1940s, but they were.  There is no equal.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is fun to play and is a good way to just take your mind off of whatever is going.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was honestly a masterpiece! This book had me crying in some parts,and laughing in others. I also love the way Veronica also wrote in Tobias` point of view!
B00CSKZI2A|5.0|The sexual tension between these two makes the show.  It's too bad Granger is sending Kensie off indefinitely.  Hope this doesn't mean she's off the show!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!! . It was amazing. I love this author. Her details are amazing. I wonder if the world will be like that in the future.
B000YHG72E|5.0|With prime it showed up quickly and we made apart of our advent calendar as a Christmas Classic! Great movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a beauty and the beast themed story... I love the character's! They are so deep and well developed. The plot brings you through some serious highs and the lows. The book leaves you wanting more!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|You want this.<br />You really want this, and at $35, you have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />Works with Netflix, Pandora and Chrome.  Also works from my Moto X phone.<br /><br />Anything you do ,like magic, on to the TV.  My stone-age self is amazed.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an excellent read full of emotion,  and excitement. I would recommend it to anyone, it's well worth the time.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book<br />One of favorite series . Close to harry potter for me read it once already I'll read it again
B003VANOFY|5.0|Love it.  Great surround sound, I can hear footsteps all around me and track enemy movements.  Can be used wireless or wired if the battery gets low.  Comfortable for long play sessions.  Pop up on screen will let you know if you need to plug it in soon.  Batter life is great, I use it all day and just plug it in at night or when I take a break.  Mic boom has a red light on it to let you know if you accidentally muted  yourself.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this book was good at the end she really does shave  a baby at the  end it was boaring  at some  parts but very suspenseful at others
B00A822VDY|5.0|Great movie! My 4 year old isn't afraid of monsters, she loves them!<br /><br />It's great to have a dvd with the Blue-ray. We use the dvd for traveling, and the blue-ray at home.
B001EX81ZI|5.0|Works with Avent natural bottles. I pump into my bottles and use these rings when storing or transporting the milk or putting the bottle in the freezer. I have never had any issues with leakage and would highly recommend these and the avent conversion kit for a pumping mom.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I could not get this to work on my Kindle HDX, and found it difficult to cancel order. Can't get it to work.<br />Couldn't get it to work on my KindleHDX
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like temple run it's so awesome I'm so good at this when I first tried and Kayla my sister is best at it.(Leila)
B000NIWI9K|5.0|This is a masterpiece!<br /><br />The story is both hilarious and clever. The music by Mozart is among the greatest ever written and so perfectly matches the acting.<br /><br />This production on Blu-ray is a masterpiece and the standard by which other opera DVDs should be judged.<br /><br />If you are new to opera, definitely watch this. It will shatter any bad myths you have about opera. It is so entertaining for anyone.<br /><br />Refer to the other reviews for the specifics as to why it is so great. My only criticism is that Anke Vondung seems to frown in her eyes too often but sings wonderfully and great overall.<br /><br />Fantastic singing and acting by Miah Persson, Luca Pisaroni, Topi Lehtipuu, Anke Vondung, Nicolas Rivenq and Ainhoa Garmendia. Persson is young and gorgeous. Terrific performance by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (on period instruments and one of my all-time favorite orchestras worldwide) and hilarious story.<br /><br />By the way, this opera should only be performed with YOUNG actors for the four main parts, especially the two women and especially Dorabella (looking like an older teenager ideally) or the story does not make sense. The title should be translated as \\"Girls Are Like That.\\" Da Ponte poked fun at men characters in his other two masterpiece Mozart operas, and now he pokes fun at young women.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Terrific read.  great writing and a story that really grabs you.  You know you're hooked when you come home and want to read your book instead of watch tv !
B00142X56Y|5.0|Outstanding, and it gets better as the show goes on. Great video. Great filming. Great singing. Great acting. I did not care for the outfits of the Queen of the Night and the trio at the beginning, because they are unflattering, but that is just personal taste.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Mozart and/or opera, also consider the even better Blu-ray opera of Mozart's [[ASIN:B000NIWI9K Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte]]  with Miah Persson, Luca Pisaroni, Topi Lehtipuu, Anke Vondung, Nicolas Rivenq and Ainhoa Garmendia.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Easy to play. Good graphics. Options  for one-touch moves or drag and drop. No issues with game play. You can add your own background photo.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|His BEST CD yet!  Love Eminem!  I may not like every song he does, but this cd seems to go back to his roots a bit.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Have read all of the Preston and Child &#34;Pendergast&#34; series and they are so good they have spoiled me for anyone else writing currently.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Egger's story reminds us that our right to live our private lives is truly sacred. Social media can be wonderful, but with unfettered access we lose a part of our distinctly unique selves.

B00G5G7EXY|5.0|We watched Frozen last night and it was one of the best animated films I've ever seen. It was so heart-warming, funny, the animation was stunning and the singing and music were wonderful. I just preordered the DVD because I wanted to go right back into the theater and watch it again, right then and there.
0920668372|5.0|I have always loved these books so I had to get one for a few of nieces for them to be able to read to their children.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars hit an emotional cord with me that hadn't been touched in quite some time. Green creates realistic characters that draw the reader into an emotionally riveting story that made me laugh, made me angry, made me cry. Although there are instances of foul language, the circumstances warrant it. I recommend this novel.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Comparing with Apple TV which I have 2 in my house, I found this Chromecast does have its potential.  I will have more to say latter.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing to see what all this fussing was all about...now I am addicted to this game. Love love love candy crush.

0316113514|4.0|Author John J. Ratey has something to say that he believes could brighten our lives.  The “brightening” is reflected even in the title of his book, Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain.  Ultimately, Ratey, the associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and previous author of Driven to Distraction, wants to share his belief that “exercise is the single most powerful tool you have to optimize your brain function.”  The book is somewhat repetitive in the later chapters, which is why I have to give it only four stars instead of five, but the messages, evidence, and arguments Ratey provides are very convincing and interesting.  I already exercise many hours per week as a collegiate athlete but after reading this book I will even more motivated to continue exercising after I finish my college career!<br />Spark has two main messages.  The first is that we, as humans, are in more control of our mental health than we currently believe.  The second is that we can use exercise to help control our mental health.  Ratey wants us to know that we can be proactive about changing our mental state instead of simply relying on drugs to alleviate symptoms.  He wants not only people suffering from physical and mental diseases but also normal people to know that they can exercise to help improve many parts of their lives.<br />The following information is presented in the book.  First, Ratey tells the readers about Naperville Central High School in Illinois.  He describes how the high school implemented a revolutionary physical education program and how the school’s very successful students are now benefitting.  Next, the author describes how exercise (aerobic exercise in particular) has shown to increase the potential for learning in the brain.  He explains that exercise helps us optimize our mental approach (it improves our awareness and motivation), promotes wiring of cells, and spurs development of new cells in the hippocampus. The rest, and core, of the book is about debilitating mental diseases and how exercise counteracts them.  He describes exercise’s counteractive effects on chronic stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, attention deficit disorders, and aging.  He even includes a section on how exercise positively influences woman suffering from PMS and postpartum depression.<br />One fault of the book is that the later chapters are repetitive.  The author includes a full chapter for each problem (anxiety, depression, etc.) that exercise helps alleviate.  Obviously, the effects of exercise on the body do not change for each chapter.  Only the context and applications of the effects change.  As I got deeper and deeper into the book, I grew less attentive because the chapters were so predictable; I knew Ratey would declare another problem that exercise counteracts, reiterate how exercise affects our body, and explain the specifics of how exercise affects the problem.  The book would have received five stars from me if Ratey had presented each of these new chapters in more exciting ways or if he had combined some of these chapters to reduce redundancy.<br />Still, the book had many positives.  The chapters are moderate in length and are easily organized into many subsections.  The author mentions many research studies, including the names of the leaders of the studies, to support his statements.  Anecdotal evidence from his patients (Ratey is a practicing psychiatrist) provides strong context and examples for his statements as well.  Ratey does a good job of interweaving the technical details behind the changes in the brain with general conclusion statements.<br />The technical detail included in the book also helps it succeed despite its fault.  Ratey often describes the underlying changes in the brain that are brought by exercise, which includes regulation of neurotransmitters.  It seems that a neurotransmitter is referenced at least once every couple of pages.  He explains how exercise promotes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and regulates dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levels.  The author explains how the mental diseases he addresses are often marked by irregularities in the neurotransmitters and how exercise helps fix the irregularities.  Also, Ratey describes how dendrites grow and wither and how synapses strengthen and weaken, all in the context of how exercise affects learning.<br />In conclusion, the book provides a fresh take on how humans can counter the growing physical and mental diseases the affect our society.  It is well known that exercise helps us physically, and Ratey wants the public to know that it has significant effects on our mental health as well.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A time to Kill is one of John Grisham's best books.  Sycamore Row follows after by 3 years; same characters.

I have read all of his books and I rate it as one of his best.

B00DJ735KI|5.0|Wow! Of all the books I have read over the past 70 years, this book from Bruce Lipton has had the most profound impact on my understanding of the reality of life. What a shame that all my previous years of struggle trying to get to grips with Success, Happy Loving Relationships, Fitness and Health, Positive Parenting etc, were all based on falsity and doomed to failure. The truth is that up 'til now, science has not understood the true role of our genetic structure and/or how our environment truly impacts how we unconsciously think and act - even as babies in the womb!!!!<br />This outstanding book should be required reading for everyone! Every scientist  - every doctor - every teacher - every student - every theologian - YOU!!!<br />I promise you, this work has the power to change you - in a profound and positive way - for ever.<br />Thank you Bruce Lipton.

B008602KQI|4.0|This is a good movie,not great but still well worth a watch.It's so long,and tedious at times,but it's still pretty interesting.Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss character is the highlight of this obviously.I did also like the roles portrayed by Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz.The one negative was Peeta - My gosh he is such an annoying dork! Anyway even if you've never read the books,which I never have,the movie will keep you interested.It's strange at times,even dark and violent,though that's not surprising considering the concept.Still a good story of what one is willing to sacrifice for the ones they love and how hard they're willing to fight to overcome the odds.Though this movie's favorite quote after all is &#34;May the odds ever be in your favor.&#34;

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Every once in a while I read a book that hits me so hard it knocks the breath out of me. This was one of those books. It took me some time to collect myself enough to sit down and write this review, because John Greene is simply a genius, and I can only hope to do his book justice with these few paragraphs.<br /><br />Sixteen year old Hazel Grace, because of a miracle drug, has been able to fight cancer and live longer than anyone expected her to. She lives day in and day out with the knowledge and the fear that her condition could worsen and cut her life short. She’s also not a regular teenager since her normal routine consists of medical treatments and attending a cancer support group. It is at this support group that she meets Augustus Waters. Augustus is immediately smitten with her and the two of them start a friendship that throughout the story blooms into a romance.<br /><br />Augustus Waters also has cancer, although he has been “NEC” (No Evidence of Cancer) for a few years now. As a side effect of his ailment, he lost part of one leg and now walks with a prosthetic. As a former basketball player and as a result of his charismatic personality, Augustus has no trouble making friends and being liked. Although it’s apparent that Hazel and Augustus very much like each other, Hazel is cautious about not starting a relationship with him. Since she considers herself to be sicker than him, she doesn’t want to be the “grenade” that explodes and leaves shattered hearts on everyone that loves her. As a result of a chain of events in this story, Hazel and Augustus end up traveling together to Amsterdam to meet the author of a book that Hazel idolizes. During this trip their relationship begins to transform as the harsh reality of their condition begins to hit them head-on.<br /><br />I recommend that you read this book with a box of tissues in hand, because not only will you will fall in love with the characters and will suffer with them through their hardships, but you will also fall in love with their love. The level of emotion that this book brings out is very deep. You do not have to be a cancer victim, survivor, or even to have known someone with cancer to understand and feel what they are going through. It is painfully realistic and delightfully uplifting at the same time. A combination that in this case is pure gold. 5 stars all the way.ships, but you will also fall in love with their love.

B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is a beautiful heart warming story.<br />I don't know why it wasn't rated higher.<br />Probably because there is no violence in this movie.<br />This is a real story. Great heroic person who loved to surf.<br />His memory lives on to this day.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I put together a new desktop PC, and though I love the AMD A-10 6800K chip, the stock cooler was of almost NO use.<br /><br />I first assembled with the pre-dispensed heat paste on the heat sink that came with the processor. No over clocking, all fan speeds set to max. Idled at 35 C. Just running the Win-7 Windows Experience Index test twice in a row sent big red warning messages to the screen, exceeding 60 C and climbing. Overheated several times during light use, loading software, and watching on-line videos. Removed stock paste and replaced with Arctic Silver 5. Same exact behavior.<br /><br />This is running on a ASUS A85XM M-Board in a Cooler Master NSE-200 small tower case with FOUR 120mm fans, plus another 120mm fan in the bottom-mounted Corsair 430W PS.  Ambient temp of 70F. Motherboard temp remains steady at 26 to 27 C.<br /><br />Replaced stock CPU fan and heat sink with the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus. This LARGE, very TALL cooling rig (barely fits with the case closed up), comes with one 120 mm fan, and is capable of two 120 mm fans, but my small board and tall memory forced me to run just one fan, sucking, not blowing air thru the fins. CPU now idles at 30 C, and extended flat-out CPU loading with Burn In cannot get CPU temp above 43 C. CPU fan speed barely moves up at all., and CPU temp returns rapidly to 30-31 C upon return to idle state.<br /><br />The mostly graphical install instructions cover so many CPU types and so many languages, that it folds out like an old-fashioned interstate road map.  But after a few initial worries about getting the side cover back on the case with this cooler installed, it all fell together.  My case was a big help in that removing the side panel behind the mother board exposed the backside of the board enough to make installing the cooler's backing plate a snap, and both side panels bulge outward 1/2 an inch or so, which helped with the top of the cooler just clearing the side cover. The plastic fan mounting clips were great.  Fan clicks securely in place.  Some earlier reviews mentioned a wire mounting clip that was a problem.  Seems the manufacturer took notice and improved on that.  I had to remove the clips and reverse them to change the airflow direction.  Took just seconds.<br /><br />I still felt that there should be some air being PUSHED through the heatsink fins, but I just couldn't mount the optional second 120 mm fan due to clearance issues with RAM.  So I mounted a spare 80 mm fan to the front side of the fins with 4 quick dabs of hot glue.  Worked great.  After some further testing I opted to remove two of the four 120 mm case fans just to reduce the overall fan noise.  Now running just as cool and a lot quieter.  Would highly recommend this cooler if your case will handle it, and if you're comfortable removing your motherboard to install the backing plate, if need be.

1423140605|5.0|When I started reading the mark of Athena I was on holiday in Bali. And finished the whole thing in a afternoon, I thought the plot was very clever, with the Romans and semi-redevelopment of Athena and Annabeth’s relationship, and connection to the original Percy Jackson series. Although the thing with Gaia is a bit against the original myths. Putting Arachne under a car park, in the middle of Rome was very awesome, but the bit after that was not so awesome (it involves a rather deep pit).

B00425S1H8|4.0|As with others, I was attracted to this USB-to-Serial cable by the price and, with a few extra steps involved to get it up and running, it does the job.<br /><br />The task at hand was to connect an older model DiabloSport Predator U7140 (Mustang GT) performance tuner's serial port to my W7 64-bit Compaq laptop's USB port, in order to update the software on the tuner. Have had this tuner for several years, and this is the first software update that has been attempted.<br /><br />Following the provided directions which state that the Plugable cable's drivers are available through the Windows Update plug-n-play installation process, I connected it to an open USB port.  Indeed, Windows did acknowledge that a new device had been connected, and the driver installation screen popped open... but installation failed. My laptop's Device Manager continued to show the cable under \\"Other Devices\\", either as \\"no driver installed\\" or as 'there is a problem with the device (Code 1)'.<br /><br />After several attempts and reboots, I moved on to \\"Plan B\\" - using the CD supplied with the cable. Unfortunately, the laptop's CD drive would not read the CD, and I am still not sure why.<br /><br />OK... on to \\"Plan C\\": I went to Plugable's website support page for this cable & driver (plugable.com/drivers/prolific), downloaded the installation and text-based Help files, and tried the install that way... even tried installing as Administrator but, after several install & reboot sessions, it still would not work. Was frustrated and fully uninstalled the program through the Control Panel, Programs' routine (then rebooted).<br /><br />So far we are at a one star review, right?<br /><br />Finally -- before giving up I tried just plugging the cable into the USB port one last time. Again, the Windows Update installation routine failed, but (let's call this \\"Plan D\\") I selected an option for Windows to Search the Internet... and that was all it took. The search routine ran for about 2 minutes and then the installation process automatically kicked off, resulting in a pop-up window stating that installation was successful. A quick look at Device Manager showed that the cable had now been assigned to COM7.<br /><br />Go figure. Ummm... I highly recommend you try \\"Plan D\\" as your first avenue of trouble-shooting.<br /><br />One issue remains though; this install and COM 7 assignment is not permanent on my machine. When I unplug the cable from the USB port, it disappears from Device Manager and I have to go back through \\"Plan D\\" all over again. Now that I know this it is a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />In the end the cable worked, but it took a bit to get there.then the installation process automatically kicked off, resulting in a pop-up window stating that installation was successful.

B007QA3AH2|5.0|Best Star Trek parody movie ever - wish we could have a sequel to this fine movie.  I am not a Tim Allen fan (nor Shatner for that matter) but this movie made me like them both - this is very similar to an old fan fiction story where Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley accidentally get beamed to the real Enterprise.....this was done better and included the fans of the Galaxy Quest show to resolve the outcome of the movie.  Anyway, I will watch this when ever I get the chance and &#34;Never Give Up!  Never Surrender!&#34;
B00DW39B2K|1.0|awful! john travolta's acting was so grating, robert de niro was sleeping through this movie, i could not stand it, i couldnt finish it, so i just threw away money for buying this movie.
B0081KTHEQ|3.0|Radcliffe and Hinds are excellent. However, and this is from someone who likes a lot of movies others would call slow, this movie builds very very slow! The story is not new and the ending, while artfully executed, is predictable for it's genre.
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|Good family movie to keep trying and keep the 'Dream' every before you. As an Adult I still love cartoons! :) Always on the look out for something to encourage kids.
B0032KLAKE|3.0|I'm confused by all of the great reviews (maybe I missed something.) First, the talent is terrific and the acting first rate. The story however has a huge hole in it. We are expected to accept that a Defense Attorney in a murder case would take their case to trial prior to having completed the psychiatric review that they requested. Accepting that premise is key to the story, and it is a whopper to accept. Second, the surprise ending, which I will not give away, was as predictable as they come. So, watch it for the great actors (I gave it 3 stars for that), but if you want a good story, keep looking as this one has holes you could drive a truck through.
1781162646|5.0|This book was phenomenal. Few people realize the breadth of King's work, and this falls into the type of stories he put into Different Seasons: Shawshank Redemption, Apt Pupil and The Body (Stand by Me). It isn't horror, it's supernatural and incredibly emotionally evocative. The book is great because it so perfectly captures the time that Stephen King loves so much; the college aged kid after the 1950's utopia was exposed as a facade.<br />The characters are almost prototypically cliched, but done so well. The sick child and the mother are gut-wrenching. The story itself wraps around just enough different scenery to keep it fresh but not lose the reader. This might be one of King's best books, and that's saying a lot.

I tend with this to read it out of order and more like a reference. It is already getting a little dog eared from me flipping to this page or that chapter.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|Bought this for my mom but I hate this movie so I really shouldn't be rating this. But oh well!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I've really enjoyed this game. The graphics are wonderful and I've been able to play pretty well without having to add tons of friends just to be able to play.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Great movie and great era. This is certainly a classic worth having. Great idea... Make all your guy friends sit with you and watch it and they might start to forget what it feels like to be with the guys.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book made me angry and sad.  It made me laugh and cry.  This book helped me see my everyday trials in a different light.  Amazing
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Ads between every single game and a lag when playing---it's quicker to play the actual card game!  Kind of ridiculous.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This movie is about as good as can be made.  It stands alone on so many levels; and is an outstanding example of what can be when we rise to what is honorable...and what is the result... when we descend to darkness.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this great game. Its great for all ages and different in so many fun ways! Its so fun so i would really recomend it. GO GET IT NOW!!!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Short and sweet - one of the best<br />movies ever. In my top 10 for sure, most likely in the top 5
B0033TJATW|5.0|The video is so clear and we are enjoying it.  All of adult children are waiting to see it.  We will all watch it together at Christmas!
1594746036|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Could not put it down. I do agree that it's better in book form vs kindle format. The pictures are amazing.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|There is a different challenge figuring out how each room works. Occasionally frustrating when you cannot put the steps together, but perseverance will pay off. I certainly got $0.99 entertainment out of this game.
B00GO8Z8H2|1.0|based on the prices I thought I was buying an actual season. bunch of promo junk and one episode. this is ridiculous.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|FANTASTIC movie, I went to the theater to see it and didn't mind watching it a second and third time.
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|action packed  on time works welllooking forward to number 7 fast cars a lot of action good fightinglook forward to watching again
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Things worked fine at first but after using it two times it stopped loading.  So it is now unusable!  Disappointing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so fun and it kills time when you have nothing to do! I feel that you should download it game
B004UID2LC|2.0|Can't sign in to my channels or can't figure it out, no instructions. Having a hard time finding the channels I subscribe to
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Its like the book jumps out at you and its got a great plot and twist! This is all that and then some!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that I can take notes on my laptop, phone or kindle fire and this app will sync everything across all the platforms.
B0037VNX44|2.0|This was a step below the b movie and really stunk up the place! Not worht the time to rate!
B00DNCUX8G|5.0|This unit works as described. When used with a practical meter this unit charges an iphone 5 in full under 2hrs. Very nice product and I like the authentic amazon logo on it.
B00B2OSZIW|2.0|I have used the grip only once. My main problem with the grip is when I have to change the battery and/or the memory card, The grip is covering the slot for both, and if you need to change either of the items you need to remove the grip first, and i find it cumbersome, time consuming especially if you have to shoot quickly.But the grip itself feels really good in my hand.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Most of the poems are very humorous.  With there were more and that they all cause laughing and rolling around the floor.  My cat loved every one.  She read the book when I wasn't looking.
B009FXIICK|3.0|Didnt understannd the game so don't want to rate this 5 stars @ least I gave it 3 stars.but learning how to play
B001N3EZW2|5.0|Classic, loved this movie since I was a kid. Great story, will watch again and again. Robbie the robot, what more do you need?
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|It was taking forever to load, so I stopped loading it. It may be a perfectly good app since the name is celebrated.
B00628RVV0|4.0|Wonderful movie about the innocence of children.  I liked that it wasn't very graphic violence, but you still understood what was going on.
B00EKTCQCC|1.0|It took forever downloading and I got tired of waiting and cancelled the process; so, needless to say I can't rate it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|beautiful screen display and works well. easy to set. one of my most favorite apps. I added weather to it and it takes<br />unbelievable.
B00GHJ25C4|5.0|She continues to grow as an artist. Not too many multi-talented artists out there anymore, so give up the Applause.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Way too many characters. very confusing !!!!!  A good story line but the author ruined it and dragged and dragged out certain scenarios.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Clever plot twists and interesting characters. Sydney area well researched. Can't wait to read next in the Harry Hole series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is a great game that is fun. but I don't know why I have to type this all
B004LROUNG|4.0|This nonfiction work is quite different than the usual Grisham stories but was interesting. Would recommend reading a sample first
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the graphics and the missions but with everything didn't cost so many crowns. This is a fun game glad to have It on my kindle.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|My daughter loves this film. Lego films have always been a favorite in this home. Highly recommended to those who have Lego lovers.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Completely Loved It! A great story, outstandingly writing, andkept my interest piqued from beginning to end. Not for prudes -- its a real story. Highly recommend.
B00005NNT1|5.0|Grandkids love it when they come to visit.  It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so it's a classic!
1400049628|4.0|When i bought this book i wanted to have some laughs, and i had. But in a case of real zombie apocaypse this is an actual functional manual, which tells you almos everything you should need to survive by yourself.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|enough lives so that you rarely run out.  Gives enough of a challenge not to be boring.  A good time burnrr
B00FTGYNUS|5.0|Even without having seen it yet, I know it will be another knock your socks off production. She is the ultimate performer. I'm still patiently waiting for Amazon to tell me when I am getting my pre-ordered copy. The day of release they were back ordered and out of stock. Hope to be able to enjoy this by Christmas if not sooner.<br />Even so, Pink is my all time favorite artist. Since I've not been able to catch her show live here in the states on this or her previous Funhouse tour, the tour dvd is my ticket to this amazing show.<br />What I would like to know, however is why it was originally supposedly released on December 3rd here in the states and then suddenly was out of stock and backordered, and now it says this item will be released on January 21st. So which is it Amazon? Was it ever actually available on December 3or was the release date always January 21? I will wait another month for it because I am a huge fan, but I wish Amazon had been upfront about the real release date from the beginning. I had hoped to have this item before or by Christmas.
B00632HWOG|1.0|DO NOT USE THIS APP.  USE THE MAIL APP THAT COMES WITH KINDLE.<br />have had this app for about 1 year.  yesterday, with no warning or explanation, yellow highlighted ads started appearing in my inbox, not on the side, but right in with the emails, flashing in my face.  no way to delete or unsubscribe, no way to identify sender.  since then,  a series of approx. 6 ads every time i opened my email (or every 20-30 minutes if i left it open).  after 16 hours on the phone with yahoo, frontier (my internet provider &quot;powered by yahoo&quot;), and kindle support,  i finally figured out that THE UNSOLICITED, NONREMOVABLE ADS ARE COMING FROM THIS YAHOO MAIL APP.<br />i went back to the email app that came with my kindle.  no more ads.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Really written in a style for maybe simple teenagers? A very immature writing style, yet erotic inclination - just goes to show - 'sex sells'
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Disney / Pixar Movies are always good. Especially the monster series. As an Adult i always enjoy watching this with my youngest
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Just fabulous, heart-rending, poignant stuff - a very special book to read and savor and to bring one back to reality, and appreciation of one's life
0140067477|5.0|I first read this book in college as part of  an Eastern Thought class.  I was profoundly moved by it, and the class material on Taoism in general.  I have to admit that I would be the world's worst Taoist, but this book lets you appreciate the subtle beauty of their worldview.  The only problem with this book is that when you loan it out, people hate to let it go.  I have lost over 5 copies where I just let the person keep it because they loved it so much.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This book captivates from the very beginning.  It is well written.  Grisham at his best.  It made me just want to keep going and going until I got to the end.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|A very entertaining movie for Teens, and adults that can appreciate the tongue-in-cheek take on superheros.  Good rainy afternoon material.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I use this on a Kindle Fire HD &amp; it works great.  Try this one when you have time to kill.
B00G3HSF7O|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. If you like futuristic movies, this won't disappoint. Matt Damon could have studied his Rosetta Stone a bit more, but other than that, the acting was good and you could tell this movie had a high budget. It definitely had you on the edge of your seat at times and was just an all around fun movie to watch. No sex. No nudity. I don't even remember if there was any cussing. Oh, and Jodi Foster plays a total bitch way too well. Highly recommend!!!:-D
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a great book, very entertaining. Don't be put off if you saw the movie and didn't like it, the book only has the title in common.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|These were a fantastic way to commemorate the 50th Anniversary.  DW has such great characters, stories, and fans.  Here's to another 50 years!
B005USZYDU|4.0|This kid was amazing. The book was interesting and cute. With Theo helping his class mates with issues it kept u reading.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|The video is what I expected and is very informative, it meets all my expectations. Video is much easier to follow than the book.<br />Sound and video quality is very good.
1577314808|5.0|GOOD MOTIVATIONAL BOOK. It has allot of insight on living in the moment which is not easy for me.Some good practical reading.
B00C32TPZE|4.0|From what I'd heard of Volbeat on the radio, I thought it above average. Found this for only $1.99 during a promotional black Friday sale and snagged it. I'm glad I did. These guys are crisp as an ensemble, and the lead singer has a smooth voice that strikes me as a cross between Shinedown and Godsmack. Only much better. Volbeat may not be the most distinguished sounding, personable band out there. But there tunes are impressively constructed and melodic. This is a nice output for fans of hard rock and metal.
B00005A0V0|5.0|Caravan was a bit of a strange combination. Viola, synthesizer, mellotron and rock guitar, and a bit of humor in album and song titles. I was crazy about the music from the first time I heard it, and own all of their music. There is some classical influence, and some good time rock and roll.
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|Avicii taps the zeitgeist-y sound of EDM and fuses it together with country, pop, and elements of dubstep. Nearly every song has high replay value. Worth having.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|This is an alternate version of the 'mystery' surrounding Shakespeare's writings and quite the interesting tale. I truly enjoy this movie and the performances by Rhys Ifans and Vanessa Redgrave are fantastic.
B0081TZUAW|5.0|I own all but one Garbage album, and this is the most accomplished work they've ever put out. With Version 2.0 a close second. That's untouchable in its own right. I've come back to this album many times since downloading it a year and a half ago. Each time I remain impressed. It's a shame Shirley Manson's band hasn't retained the commercial popularity they achieved during their 90's hey day. This is high quality work deserving of a wide audience. Also, there's a lot she could teach contemporary pop starlets in regards to focus, emotion, song craftsmanship, and overall stage persona. I hope Garbage continues on making great music.
145210655X|5.0|I bought both Darth Vader books for my daughter and son in law. They loved them both. Now that they are raising their own kids, watching Lord Vader struggle with his own is so much fun.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|What a wonderfully traditional tale.<br /><br />When two children visit their eccentric aunt they are not prepared for the wonderful adventure which awaits them inside her home. Stepping through the fireplace they enter a magical land where the firebird lives.<br /><br />However children beware! The evil witch also resides there and she eats little children. In a story filled with enchantment and excitement this is the kind of book we long for from our childhoods.<br /><br />Reassuring and with a 'happy ever after' this is an ideal short read for children and adults alike.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|We had fun but bent the rules like they suggested so more challenging.  Needs a hour glass timer in the box too.
B006GKHE6G|1.0|OG galaxy note. Installed and nothing but a black screen. Sits there for 30 seconds or so, then goes back to the app tray. Tear.
B000069KE0|4.0|one of the best albums ever made had the original but got scratched been listening to this for over forty years
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist is a truly precious book because it encourages you to follow your dreams through the lessons of ancient wisdom and love.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I first bought this game on my old device but got rid of it to save space later. Then I got it again so that a year later my device broke. Now I have a new better device and I am getting it again!
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|This is by far the best app I have ever downloaded. The game play is incredibly simple, but well placed obstacles and portals give a steady challenge. The accelerometer mode is extremely well executed as the control is fluid and natural unlike other games I've played using this feature. I am looking forward to playing more!
1400079144|2.0|Brown is not the best writer. He has a history of falling short in character depth and plot details. I didn't buy this book though expecting a masterpiece. I bought The Lost Symbol because I expected the classic &#34;Brown&#34;; a good story based around an interesting topic with a twist.<br /><br />Brown delivers the classic &#34;Brown&#34; but didn't do a good job.<br /><br />Before you buy this you need to understand that it is very similar to The Da Vinci Code except worse in every way. So if you have read the DVC you should expect a plot based on an interesting topic with a suspense driven story.<br /><br />Now where it falls short of The Da Vinci Code,...<br /><br />The subplots in this book are very poorly done. Brown spends a good deal of time trying to invest you into the characters but falls short. The story of the main characters does not make you care about them. The story of the antagonist doesn't make you understand their motives. So you will not finish the book to find out what happens to them.<br /><br />You will only want to finish the book to find out what &#34;The Lost Symbol&#34; is. Sad to say too, you will be disappointed. The ending in this book makes me assume that Brown, instead of making the pieces fit the puzzle perfectly, just added an ending to end it. The questions were answered at the end of The Da Vinci Code, the questions were not answered in this book.<br /><br />As this is just a review you should take what I say with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Now if I was to rate this book and use The Da Vinci Code as a 10, saying it is a 4 would be generous.<br /><br />TL;DR<br /><br />Do not buy this book expecting other Brown works. The only reason I would buy this book would be to finish the Robert Langdon collection. Even a Masons enthusiast would not get their interest quenched with this one.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love it!!!  You could look up songs like it's a computer.  Though it takes a few moments to load. All in all I rate it five stars
0694003611|5.0|I chose this for a niece who didn't have many books. She is the age of this classic, and having taught preschoolers a long time, I knew this book was very…endearing? to the children. I got a Facebook video the other day of her &#34;reading it&#34; to me, with just one prompt from the adult. I was very tickled, and proud of her.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This app ripped me off. Waste of space, time, and money. I bought 'Lisa' and it was a ripoff. I wasted $3.99 on it, and now I am almost out of money. Do not buy!!!!
0671449028|5.0|This book is a board book, just the right size for little hands, and a nice gentle read to send them off to sleep. After you have done this a couple of times, they start saying it with you if old enough. This is a good thing. I have gifted many many children with this book/
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app offers lots of white noise sounds. I LOVE the Urban Rain. I can put this on and I will be asleep in no time, perfect for napping. So relaxing that I can put it on speaker and even the dogs zonk out.
0805047905|5.0|I chose this for a niece who didn't have many books at all. This is one of the first ones I picked for her. The lovely pictures and repetitive text kept her interested, and she is starting to recite text along with the reader. Thats a good thing!
B0034GK7DM|5.0|I love this c.d. and Easton. I love his voice. I play this a lot and would buy other music by him.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|No sex, no violence, but a really good story.  Very character driven, Grisham's newest reminds me of what I loved about him in the beginning.
B004T4M5TM|3.0|A co-worker of mine was taking out things in his locker, preparing to go home for the day. He placed many of his things on the table close to where I was eating lunch. One of these things was a book. I am always interested in looking at a book, at the very least to determine what it’s subject matter is. I asked him if he thought it was a good book. He told me he loved it, it was hilarious, that he had just let another co-worker borrow it, and would be happy to let me borrow it. Provided I didn’t keep it for three months like she did. I decided what the hell, I was curious enough. And thus, I borrowed his copy of Tina Fey’s Bossypants.<br /><br /> I don’t know that much about Tina Fey. What I do know I have learned from pop culture references from entertainment news, like when Huffpost says something about one of her performances. I also learned about her from internet memes. So, what little I do know I respect. However, I have never watched SNL since the early ’90’s and I have never seen one episode of 30 Rock. So, I am not a huge fan, or even a little desk fan perched near by saying, “Good job.” Nope, just curious. So, I borrowed the book that my co-worker said wouldn’t take me but a few days to read. Now, I am done and can say that there are two very different sets of skills involved in writing sketch comedy and humorous prose, and Tina Fey only has one of these sets.<br /><br /> The book is pretty much an autobiography, not a true one, just chronologically speaking. She moves through her early life to her professional career, but without detail. She only tells stories that would loosely count as anecdotes. Taken as individual stories, they are fine. They are something she might share on Letterman’s couch, or shared in front of the Actor’s Studio audience. When all these little tales of Fey’s life are put together they make little sense, for there is on over all theme. For example, there is a whole chapter on her dad, which shows little. One would expect that this chapter would show clearly how Don Fey played a major role in the development of Tina Fey as a person, or some impact on her career. Unfortunately, you don’t get that. Don is cool, and a Goldwater Republican. Some of this surely influenced Mrs. Fey, but I am not sure how. Does this impact her politics, her sense of fashion?<br /><br /> The book was not completely devoid of humor. However, none of it was ‘laugh out loud’ funny. Most of the stories were cute. A tiny Tina in love with gay boys, like an ’80’s movie, a John Hughes film. A nerdy girl, whose real beauty is hidden behind the wrong clothes and a thick pair of glasses, who stumbles and laughs too much, but at the end is turned into some truly gorgeous creature. They are little tales of a good-geeky girls discovering that the world is a pretty weird and dirty place, like the chapter about pissing jars in offices of writers. There are also some behind the scenes bits from her years at SNL and 30 Rock, but nothing that interesting. The book is not a ‘tell-all’ after all. It does showcase her personality, and it is a pleasant one. I think it would be great to be friends with her.<br /><br /> In conclusion, because any review of this book should be short (it is a very short book) this is a book for fans. Only fans of Mrs. Fey would be truly able to appreciate these small windows into her life. Only true Feynatics would find it at all funny. Anyone outside these two groups is really wasting their time reading this book. I was curious about her after being exposed to all the love for her spread across the internet, but having read her book, I am not rushing about trying to watch 30 Rock. I did gain more respect for her as a person though. While I didn’t laugh much, I am very glad a woman like her is a celebrity and influencing young women and men. So, if you love Tina Fey, or you have some time to kill, and a friend you lets you borrow the book, well, hell, why not?e would expect that this chapter would show clearly how Don Fey played a major role in the development of Tina Fey as a person, or some impact on her career. Unfortunately, you don’t get that. Don is cool, and a Goldwater Republican. Some of this surely influenced Mrs. Fey, but I am not sure how.

B002PZ6XB8|5.0|Good movie.  A movie everyone can enjoy, no bad language.  We need more movies like this one.  Good clean movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Free is good. The graphics are great. It's fun watching what the little buggars do, especially the skunk. I like games where the objective is not to beat a time or kill something. However many items are bought with acorns which are hard to come by without purchasing them with real money or being very patient. Since there is plenty to do without them I'll still give the game 5 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Best out of the whole series. Katniss semi....takes responsibility for her actions ....but she still pisses me off doing so. I just want to shake her....and say this is your life.....WAKE UP!<br />recommended if u have read the games and fire.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|If you consider it as one film, the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy (extended versions), is my favorite film.  When the &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; came out, I was as excited as the kid I was when &#34;The Empire Strikes Back&#34; came out.  However, I left the theater depressed and disappointed.  Yes, it has some great scenes, but it also have some terrible parts that deeply hurt the film.  Most fans like myself found themselves believing every second of &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34;, but there were several scenes in &#34;The Hobbit&#34; where I was groaning or screaming &#34;Bulls***!&#34;  I was fine until the scene with the three trolls.  Once the dwarves entered Goblintown, the stupidity just starts piling up like manure in a barn.  Surfing on a broken bridge down a bottomless cliff? Please!<br /><br />The extended version is better than the theatrical version and adds more depth to the story.  Seen on Blu-ray, the detail of the sets and costumes and digital effects are incredible.  If you can suffer through the stupid scenes, it's worth it.  The second movie looks to be a lot better!
B008VJYWMY|5.0|Il Divo have good voices and the song choice is great. The background music is also excellent. I enjoy from beginning to end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So I bought this thinking &#34;It's $35 what's the big deal, I won't buy lunch a couple days this week if it's junk.&#34;  Well, it isn't junk.  In fact I've had NetFlix, Hulu and Amazon Prime subscriptions for a while and really didn't watch that much since it's only usable when I'm at the computer.  Since getting this I have cancelled my Cable subscription and just watch movies and shows off the internet.  Don't be concerned by people saying the only way to get your money's worth is by using &#34;hacks&#34; or 3rd party software with it.  Most of those are scams.  Use it as is without modification and it's great!
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is a wonderful remake of my favorite Christmas movie. I admit I miss the scene with the mailbags in the courtroom, but overall it's more than satisfactory.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush saga is a fun and it has a lot of challenges but thing was it was not on kindle I tried everything but it happiness movement in the world
B005LLSZNM|3.0|Story is getting way out of hand and nonsensical. Wanted to like it but just couldn't. But at least it moves faster than a regular soap opera.
B00BATG18K|5.0|I love Amy Tan's books. This one was so good and held my interest throughout....Her characters in this book are so real and I could hardly stand to turn off the Kindle at night and put it down. Great book
B00FMJIF10|5.0|[This review is for the Set of CD's and not the mp3 version. The CD set is available on Amazon.ca for less than $ 20 Canadian (as of this writing.)]<br /><br /> The first time I heard the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by George Szell was in a triple GYM at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. You would expect the sound to be muddy in such a terrible environment, especially when the stage was placed in the middle of the long wall, the opposite of the ideal shoe-box concert hall.<br /><br />The performance, however was incredible, unbelievable in fact. Beethoven’s Forth and Eight symphonies seemed to flow out of the end of Szell’s baton. The orchestral precision was so marvelous. Every bow seemed to be at the same millimeter ... on every fiddle. The sound was precise yet powerful … and yet perfectly balanced. The strings sounded like a giant string quartet with very clear brass and woodwinds layered on top. Compared with any previous experience, the performances were simply awesome. Under George Szell the CSO became perhaps the best Beethoven Orchestra in North America.<br /><br />The Szell set of Beethoven symphonies was the fourth set I bought on vinyl. I had complete sets by Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Herbert von Karajan. I loved them all for different reasons. Then I obtained the Szell set and they were played to death. Only the Karajan Seventh and Ninth got more plays. Over forty years have passed since then. and I have collected over two dozen different sets of Ludwig’s NINE … so many happy hours of listening to so many great performances (and some not so great.)<br />Now Amazon.ca offers the Szell SONY set for less than 20 bucks. WOW! Is it any good? Silly question! This is the same Szell Beethoven with precision and power … now with even better sound. Thanks SONY. I love you.<br /><br />If you have never heard Szell’s Beethoven, you are in for a real treat. Get it now before the price increases or they sell out. You will not regret it.<br /><br />PS 1 In the last movement of the NINTH, you can hear George Szell grunting as he extols the Clevelanders to give even more. I guess the engineers will never be able to remove those grunts.<br /><br />PS 2 Where do I rank the Szell’s set? I rank it right at the top along with Karajan (both 1962 and 1977 sets), Gardiner, Zinman, and Wand.<br /><br />PS 3 If you love the Fifth and Seventh, get Fritz Reiner’s Chicago Symphony recordings. Incredible!<br /><br />In Summary: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Happy Listening!<br /><br />PS 1 In the last movement of the NINTH, you can hear George Szell grunting as he extols the Clevelanders to give even more.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a book to pull you in on the very first page. Donna Tartt is an ARTIST with WORDS
B000FC2KL0|5.0|This book was great. I cannot find the words to describe how enjoyable this book was. I really am speechless, I love the band and this was an enlightening way to learn about the story of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Read this book, it is incredibly relatable and overall a wonderful read!

B00AF82WTO|2.0|...and not tears of joy. Being my favorite story of Jane Austens and seeing the other very well done BBC adaptations I was excited to see this film. Right up until I watched it. There were many things I didn't care for in the prior version but at least I felt they did a decent job of casting. Someone screwed up here. Mr. Wentworth isn't that bad and actually as it went on I didn't mind him so much when compared to the tediousness of watching Anne. What was with the open mouth throughout the whole entire film? I only gave it two stars because i did see where this could have been a great adaptation. They did so well with Sense and Sensibility and Northanger Abbey... what happened?
B00594XOZU|1.0|kik acts up way too much for me to use it i need to be able to use it without it acting up

0743454537|5.0|“My Sister's Keeper” by Jodi Picoult is a book that is showing how a family is coping with their oldest child having cancer. It shows how each member of the family deals with the situation. It makes you stop and think about how you would deal with someone that you truly care about having cancer. It also makes you wonder how you would help that person live their life to the fullest. This is a very enjoyable book, but get ready to cry. It is a tearjerker.<br /> “My Sister's Keeper” is a very real book. The way that Jodi Picoult writes it is like you are with this family along their whole journey. You are there for every little thing that happens in their lives. When something happens, you feel for them. I cannot think of any weaknesses in this book. Even though this book is not an upbeat, happy book, it is one of the best books that I have read.
B00EDUTGB2|5.0|Works fine with Kindle fire HDX 8.9.... Allows you to print almost anything even from e- mail  applications with excellent results.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is the most awesomely game I ever seen because there is a bunch of cool characters from all over the dc  comics and shows
031623480X|5.0|Great book and quite scary to think that so many of the most popular foods we eat  could be causing us serious illness.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After all the turmoil between the two characters, I was glad to see that they finally got their act together and decided to become a married couple.  I'm sure if the series was to continue they would still be getting to know each other as new people just like the rest of us have to do when we first get married.
B004NS710C|4.0|This was a really enjoyable movie. If you gat over the fact that you're not probably not going to stop a multiple SD series locomotive train with a single GP series unit it's pretty good. Pretty good action and suspense.
140006922X|5.0|Took a class in college called the Bible as Literature.<br />.  This book was even more thought provoking.  I plan to read it again!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I agree with the sentiment on a number of reviews that the vibe of these tunes is more along the lines of Superunknown (and later), but personally I think it's the strongest record since 'motorfinger... It nearly has the *hit* of that album for me, but with the more layered approach the songs have in the 2 subsequent. Honestly (and I'm surprised to be saying this) but after a year of listening, it's my 2nd favorite Soundgarden album, period. I absolutely love it.<br />Also, I have to add that the vinyl release which I have is a glorious work of art. One of the most beautifully pressed and printed records I've purchased in years, without being marketey or clever - just a really well made and thoughtful LP.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I found this book gripping and unexpected. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a couple of days... recommended!!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|The plot is set in the future.  Special effects and cinematography are well done.  Lots of action.  You won't be bored.  Great plot.  Ending suggests a sequel.  Would definitely watch if they came out with it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo is awesome! I grew up watching him. Now that I'm older I just can't get enough. Would recommend purchasing this to any one.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased my Chromecast on a Wednesday 11:30P Black Friday special for $29.99. I am not looking back at all on this nice little device. It is great! I have plugged it into an Onkyo receiver that has multi HDMI slots. I use my front Aux HDMI port and plug the USB power cord (required) in to the USB port on the front of my Onkyo device. I was very happy about that easy front-side setup.<br /><br />Problem, but resolved it, not an issue with Chromcast, but with my local home network setup. The initial setup was easy, recognition was fast, however because of the setup of my WIFI I had a little hiccup. Maybe my mention of my problem can help others ... I have a Cisco EA4500 Wireless router (love it!) and the initial setup creates two ranges, 2.4ghz and 5ghz, but not only that, it puts the same name &#34;newtorkssidname&#34; (as an example) for both ranges. As a computer application developer, the error &#34;&#34;, seemed to me to be something about &#34;finding&#34; the wireless. Knowing that I was connected, using my WIFI DLNA that I wasn't having problems connecting. So, I had a sneaking suspicion that the Chromecast could decipher between using 2.4ghz and 5ghz using the *same* network SSID name. So, I while I was trying to Chromcast connect, I changed the 5ghz name from &#34;networkssidname&#34; to &#34;networkssidname2&#34; to give it a unique name for that channel. And voila, it starting casting from my Android device, immediately.<br /><br />Ever since I've had it, I've been to my friends house, parents house, around my own house on TVs that are not connected to my cable boxes and am streaming through Amazon Prime (love it!), Hulu+ (love it!), Netflix (love it!), Google Chrome (extension) and will become more de-coupled from my satellite cable box (love it, but it's getting too pricey and lacking variety like I can get from the other three). There's no lag, very crisp and clear. My 1080p screen is awesome, music casting from Google Music (love it!).<br /><br />The devices/software I'm casting with are Windows (Vista, 7), Mac, Android (HTC One, Nexus 4, Nexus 7), iPhone (5c), Kindle Fire HD, Google Music. Unfortunately, Amazon Prime is not a casting option.e devices/software I'm casting with are Windows (Vista, 7), Mac, Android (HTC One, Nexus 4, Nexus 7), iPhone (5c), Kindle Fire HD, Google Music.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved how all these characters came together...I didn't want the book to end:-) I really wanted the ending For Tess to be different!<br />Wanted her to find great love...<br />All the possibilities...the what if's...Great story..back to Amazon for another Book by this fabulous author:-)<br />Thank you Liane...
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|The dog/pet stories were hilarious the rest not so much. When she stuck to the pet stories the book was laugh out loud
B004EF65QA|5.0|The performances are very good, the sets are memorable, Richard Armitage (co-star of the current Hobbit series) as the male lead gives a compelling performance. I've learned a lot about the industrial north of England from watching this mini-series.
B00B7IJBUY|1.0|im sorry but this is not the bon jovi I grew up with and loved in the 80s and 90s.  none of the songs catch me and make me want to listen there are only a couple that even slightly pique my interest.  I dont miss them or want to hear them again when they are over. I understand artists/musicians grow.  If thats the way they want to grow I may have to just enjoy there back catalog and be happy with it because the new stuff just does nothing for me.
B000VUCIZO|4.0|It gave me insight into the man - Steve Wozniak and I learned a great deal about computers and the creation of Apple
B005LAIHR2|4.0|its an okay movie it fits the 80's really well but its a musical movie more than a actual movie it is entertaining I just wish it had been more of a movie than a laugh a min.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|Love Bonfire Heart and with other artists, I might just download the one song.  But again, I love every song on the album - there's not a throwaway in the lot!  Blunt just doesn't know how to disappoint!!!  And it turns out [via Bethanny] he's a terrific guest on a talk show!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Thin plot, too many characters, and excessive name-dropping make sure this long-running series comes to a pitiful end. Charlaine Harris has lost the ability to tell a story. The constant switching from first-person to omnipotent third-person is horribly handled and distracting, and the fact that the book is filled with mundane things like what Sookie had to eat or what she wore only shows that Harris needed crap to increase the word count on this thinly plotted mess. I will never read another book by this woman.
B0053TWVDC|5.0|Childern of the corn at the best wow what a great  movie you must really be afrad of the kids
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent Show.  Cant wait to watch season 4.  Great actors and adaptation of fictional history.  Please continue this series for years to come.
B00A7ZHGS2|5.0|Excellent acting, intense action with outstanding special effects and good story line. The ending gives the feeling that their is hope, unlike so many of the other zombie movies.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Not the best movie per se, but sweet, old fashioned, enjoyable, wonderful music and gives thought to a question never asked, where do our heroes go wen they leave the stage?
B0050PYNP8|5.0|If you love s/f, from The Day the Earth Stood Still to 2001 to Close Encounters to E.T. and have been addicted to the X-Files or any of the zillion me-too TV series, you will begin to laugh at the start of this movie--which begins with our heroes attending ComicCon, no less--and not stop until the big finish. British comedy at its finest with the dynamic team of Peg and Frost joined by the talented Seth Rogan who voices the rude, brilliant and ceaselessly hip alien, Paul. This movie pokes fun at everyone and everything, as the hapless Brit nerds stumble their way through an unfamiliar, occasionally murderous, and ever paranoid, American terrain.
0316204366|2.0|Gladwell's reliance on anecdotal stories and other people's research for his books means they're pretty lightweight intellectually, but often contain some interesting, thought-provoking ideas that are good for conversation if nothing else.  But with &#34;David and Goliath&#34; he's just plain boring.  None of the ideas or stories are new, and most are pretty hackneyed by now.  The kind of person reading this book has most likely heard it all before, and will only be annoyed by Gladwell's trying to pass the ideas off as his own.  The era of this type of middle-brow pop social science book is now probably over.
0385335989|5.0|It's Outlander, 'nuff said.  Love the entire series. Wish there were a 100 stars to rate this and all of Dianna's books.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Couldn't put it down. All three of her books are bizarre stories that keep you guessing all the way to the end. She's very good at slowly revealing clues that make you want to read faster to find out just what in the world is going on.
B000002TYX|5.0|the anthology series present us with alternated takes and unreleased tracks. Making this Not a greatest hits package. I do question why the whole decca sessions are not on this set. (I have several good boots of this and you can find them on amazon.com)But other than that you get lots of songs here , alt takes and such.  It's the type of stuff I spent a lot of money to get as bootlegs..  But now here you have a good set of the early beatles , casual fans who want all the regular releases should look elsewhere. The sound quality is improved over many boot versions of these songs as well.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Not the type of story I would usually read, but I was drawn in by all the 5 star reviews and they weren't lying! Donna Tart knows how to tell a good story. I immediately purchased another of her novels after gobbling this one up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book with many twists and turns.  Typical John Grisham style to keep you guessing until the end what was going to happen.  Very interesting characters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it for the second time and loved it just as much. You don't want to put it down . You feel the characters pain and conflicting emotions. I highly recommended it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book and good story.  Has some surprising twists and discloses the flaws in human character.  Very interesting story with unexpected turns.
B00G4CXHSK|4.0|This is a fun retro-style game with simple controls and good gameplay.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it could use more levels...I was able to complete the game in just a day and a half.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love it... but it can get highly addictive so I time them. I usually get worried about their eyes with the constant exposure to computer, kindle, ipad screens...
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It makes charging your kindle a lot easier.  The short cord provided is about 3 feet.  This one make it so you can ready while you charge.<br />Love it
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I have already read Wheat Belly, the Science of Skinny and  have modified my diet to be gluten free for over a year now. Along with a few other modifications and additions.  I was urged to read this book and thought it would be a waste of time as I already knew what to do.... It was a good read. It continues where Wheat Belly leaves off expanding the reasons to stop eating wheat.  When you are gluten free you realize how much we as a society are consuming. I have been to weddings, conferences, social gatherings when there is not one gluten free option except the grapes on the platter with the crackers...This means everyone around me is consuming wheat from apps to dessert. Why is that bad?  Read the book.  You will notice that there are no books countering these stands against wheat as we know it.  This is not  controversial but wheat is so pervasive in our food supply, it will take some attention to reduce and eliminate it from our daily diet.<br /><br />I did not try his 4 week program as I am already beyond that so I cannot offer a review of that, it may be a helpful way to begin. I have dropped 10 lbs this year but that is not my reason for recommending this book. This is all about health; living longer in a healthy, not chronically ill way.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|I love it we can now watch all of our movies on the Kindle, before some would pay and some wouldn't. Its a must if you watch your own videos on the kindle.  We always load a few fun for the trips.  Great
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a fact filled book on the history of wheat, why it is no longer a good staple of our diet and how to wean off of it.
0061950726|5.0|I love historical novels about real life events. Paralleling the lives of both characters & their relationship is what made this enjoyable for me. The author made me care about what happens to each. I would read more from this writer.
B008602KQI|5.0|Fast pace and full of action…fine job of acting!  We found it very entertaining, and will enjoy watching it many times.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is great. It is fairly easy, has great graphics, and dosent make you pay for things with real money. Reel Steel WRB almost forces you to pay. I would reccomend this game!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read some great books in the past, but The Book Thief is at the top of my list.  After reading a few pages I didn't know if I wanted to continue reading a story that is narrated by Death himself.  I decided to continue.  Every page is beautifully and thoughtfully written. Markus Zusak had the ability to transfer me to Germany to walk the streets, to play with the characters, and to experience their innocence, their happy times, their sad times, their love for each other, and their hardships during war time.  The book is not filled with painful death scenes as I expected.  However, when encountered, Death himself is tender, compassionate and sensitive to passing souls.  Plenty of books have been written in fact and in fiction about WWII and of Hitler and of the Jewish people, but this is the first book that I read that brings to life the other side -- the Germany people and how they innocently got caught up in Hitler's &#34;words.&#34;  I hope the motion picture does justice to this book.  I can't wait to read other books by Markus Zusak.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I've never thought a book would be better than the actual show or movie. Though I would not recommend this book for ages 11 or older. Overall it's a great book for preteens.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love the series is all I can say... The show keeps getting better and still hold my interest. No big complaints on the show....
B0034DGP6S|5.0|Very relevant to my similar journey and relationship challenges. In this book we have so much research, current, historical and multi-cultural brought into one book which also has an interesting real life story dealing with additional challenges that arise for homeless travelers.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I am almost finished reading the book and I am waiting for something exciting to happen.  It is a bit tedious.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I actually found this book in a box of books that were donated to a book sale. Great story of a young boy surviving devastating loss but who continues to push on and survive. Book was so good I eventually added it to my e-book collection.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Cohen only gets stronger as he ages. There are songs on here that will be considered classics. This disc is always in my player.
B009TGODOK|4.0|Funny dialogue and wonderful performances, especially by Scarlett Johannsen and Penelope Cruz. Loved the scenes of Barcelona and the Gaudi architecture.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Hyperbole and a Half has been my favorite blog since I stumbled upon it. Allie describes it adventures in a human and realisticly heart wrenching manner with her words and of course, her epic comics.
006202406X|1.0|Horrible! Boring! No real love between the characters shown at all! Main characters die! Insignificant characters go on to live happily! Feels like a waist of time reading and caring about this series for all these years just for the author to act like she could care less about Tris or Four! Feels like the author just wanted to finish this book and didn't put much thought into making this her best book yet and wrapping the series up nicely for her devoted readers. Wont be watching the movies if the ending is the same as the book! Again, HORRIBLE.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! Point blank period, lol! Great for anyone. Not to hard not to easy, levels are fun and creative.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I could not put it down once I started reading it.  all of his books are spellbinding.  a truly great writer.  barbara wrightk

0385351399|1.0|I want to like you, Dave Eggers. I want to like this book. Unfortunately this book is rather terrible.<br /><br />The Circle is a cautionary tale regarding social media and the integration of technology that completely misses the mark.<br />The Circle is a Google-esque company that slowly integrates itself so fully into society that it becomes too powerful to avoid. People surrender their privacy, most voluntarily, without considering the consequences. Eggers paints this dystopian future with a rather broad brush that neither challenges nor fully engages the reader.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that The Circle is a hamfisted commentary on modern society's use of technology that adds nothing to the discussion at large. Yes, Dave, surrendering our privacy is dangerous. It's a slippery slope. We spend too much time looking at screens and not enough time truly interacting with one another. There is no mystery here. There is no suspense. There wasn't really anything to keep me turning the pages here save for my own bewilderment. &#34;How is he going to make this interesting? He's not really going to end it like this, is he? He really phoned this in, huh?&#34;<br /><br />The story is set up to have elements of mystery and suspense, but they fall flat. It should make the reader consider their own digital habits, but it really doesn't. I feel like author had a solid idea on his hands that never fully developed. The ending is testament to this being a half-baked idea that was never fully realized. Skip it. Return it. Set it on fire. Don't bother reading it unless you have nothing else in your life to entertain you.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The book just ended. The story never stopped. Every word had purpose. I was there. I saw everything. Heard every sound. Felt everything touch my skin.<br />The truth in every feeling from each character was so raw and unblemished by by what is \\"cool\\" right now. The \\"I don't care and you can't hurt me\\" theme had by many YA books stifle me. Thank you for revealing the truth. Bravery CAN be about amazing things, but more often than not it is the dull chugging along we do that truly helps us push through the ever changing seasons of our lives.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written with characters you can't help but fall in love with. Heartbreaking and wonderful. If you are human, you will love it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazing. The characters had me cracking up.  Abby and Travis were a beautiful disaster yes but they couldn't leave without each other. There were times I screamed at Travis telling him you need to throw that chick over your shoulder and do what needs to be done. At one point he did....so proud of that boy. And his family were so funny I wished they were real.<br /><br />Buy this book people. It's worth it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Having so much fun playing this HO game with a twist.  Just wish the time to play didn't run out so fast.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|A must have! Powerful voice with great songs. Better than ever. Highly recommended.<br />Celine Dion is a legend. If you are a fan, get a copy.
B001KX50BK|5.0|This a fun &#34;fantasy&#34; because never in the history of prostitution has there been a girl like Julia Roberts who walked the streets.  And was not hooked on drugs.  In real life, Roberts would have been a high class call-girl with an exclusive clientele.  To make her a hooker who flags down cars was absurd -- the writer should have did his research.  After you get past this major story WTF, the film becomes fun.
B00CH3DBNQ|1.0|Too wordy. Too many dates. Too many Muslim word and titles. Could not process all the history and important information.
B00DXPC1U6|3.0|You already know that fans of &#34;Dexter&#34; -- for the most part -- hated this final storyline.  If you followed the series to this final season, then you have no choice -- you have to watch it.  Afterward your biggest question will be &#34;Why do Hollywood writers always have to trash a series in the final season?&#34;  It would seem that they run out of ideas and the producers tell them to write anything -- the more absurd, or revolting to their fan base, the better.  So you will watch this last season and feel like you have been let down, betrayed.  And you were.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Just like the title says.  They are a highly underrated band.<br /><br />For some reason though Amazon requires more &#34;words&#34; so please ignore this sentence and the following as I believe in the eloquence of execution and articulation.  Verbosity is just a waste of everyone’s time when it's not necessary.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|A Cold War classic.  Peter Sellers is perfect in each role and the film satire is excellently written.  The movie does hold your attention all the way to the end -- the real end.
B008P9M614|4.0|This is a present for Christmas but this was the first time I had found all the seasons together in a set.
B00164GDA0|5.0|A classic &#34;coming of age&#34; film.  And it was a major turning point for the young actors and what became of their lives into adulthood.  Try and pick out which of the four died from a drug overdose, which one retired from film, which one wasted his life (to this day) on drugs, and which one married a super model (this one will surprise you).
B00CM7FLZ8|3.0|Just an okay game, at best.  My 6 year old son enjoys playing it, but my 8 year old got bored with it rather quickly.  Perfectly fine for Kindergartners and first grade, but not too exciting for everyone else.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars
B006ISJQBM|4.0|Good bio on Hunter Thompson and Johnny Depp captures his persona.  But Amber Heard steals the film when she comes out of the water next to his boat.  What a movie entrance!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|A thought provoking tale of the struggle to exist and hang onto a life that is a simple faded memory. Within 24 hours we see the tortured moral dilemmas of all the characters figuring out what is means to exist as a living creature, what constitutes as sacred life, and what it means to truly live. Just because something is artificial, yet it hold conscious thoughts and a will to live, does that not make is alive? Reading this book brings forth these questions and has the reader determine their own philosophy on the subject. This is a book worth every word.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|This is a fun film.  Good acting, good story, and good direction.  The plot twists are exceptional and the beauty and character of Marisa Tomei almost steals the film.  Note how her eyes sparkle every time she sees her ex husband.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Play this game on Facebook on my computer and on my Kindle...love the game and like the idea that it is linked to Facebook so my game doesn't lose any points whether I play it on Facebook or I play it on my Kindle.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I rated this 4 stars because it was very interesting and would recommend this book to be read by others. I will also buy another for myself.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a fun game but of course it is like many other games.  But worth the download.  Love it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and very time consuming.  Like challenging my self to get three starts on every level!<br />On level 117 and have all three stars so far.

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Not only is the CGI amazing in this movie but the underlying story and development of the plot are amazing as well.
B00EKR61FM|1.0|i thought it would show extended scenes or take outs I haven't seen or at least be specific about what was new on the desk
B00AH6ACFA|5.0|A diverse, magnificent demonstration of what Metallica does best...phenomenally brilliant rock and roll with a signature unlike any other band!

B007R11DKQ|4.0|Entertaining, humorous, interesting plot.  Geared for adult viewers due to a lot of fighting and violence.  I would not allow small children to view this movie due to the violence.
B0034G4P80|5.0|exciting and imaginative movie with all the themes with which we can identify...love, jealousy, desire for power.  Got to see the sequel at the theater and it wasn't nearly as good as the original...

B00EY8AL1M|3.0|Star Trek the next Generation has always been my favorite kind of shows to watch. Good waste of time for me.
B009HOU672|4.0|How can one improve upon Vivaldi's Four Seasons?  I'm an amateur -- a newbie who is attempting to learn more about classical music, so I'm learning &#34;on-the-job.&#34; And I am having fun using www.yale@edu. I am &#34;in class&#34; with a music appreciatiom prof and his students, so it's exciting to apply what I am learning. Forgive me for possibly being presumptious, but Richter's piece is interesting and modernized with a twist that draws the listener into the piece with the need for a more discerning ear.  It feels like a much greater intellectual piece -- a deconstruction of the Four Seasons. (I enjoyed Winter best.)  The composition seems to be an intermingling of all the movements of the seasons.  The post-modern feel is unique and as I listen, I feel as though I am hearing the work of an engineer who is able to break apart a jigsaw and reconstruct it in a new and vital way. It is certainly a work of artful engineering.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Loved the movie! Awesome movie one of my favorites. Well made movie, love the acting love the settting! very gripping!
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Way prefer Cohen's old stuff, but I'm an old hippie so call me crazy and too stuck back in the 60s.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is great and very addicting. I would like to earn gems faster. I like that you can help other players by giving gifts.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Really fun great game play. Just wish you can play more hands without having to buy tokens with real cash money. Great to pass the time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The writing in this book is compelling. It draws you in from the start by death and death tells his story from start to finish. It is haunting because you know it could have happened and you can feel the weight of death that hung over Europe during World War II. You experience everyday, average people who had nothing but suffering and for no reason. And the clever use of books and words to tie the story together makes it all the more interesting. The power of words is evident. Read this book. You can't go wrong.
0385351399|5.0|The Circle was a fun book with very interesting concepts and characters. The writing is clear and overall it was a very interesting read.

B000HWZ5W4|5.0|I never get enough of Plant's vocals. His gritty style and range are second to none  in the rock genre. The album also has incredible production quality.

B00000JFV9|5.0|A real soul classic. As I recall the sound track outgrossed the movie. CM has influenced many in the hip-hop era with his strong grooves. Solid!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Jonas is a young boy growing up in a very disciplined town. The spouses, jobs, kids and home is all chosen for them, forget freedom and privilege; in this enticing story Jonas grows up to be twelve. Every year each kid gets a gift for completing another year. When they turn twelve they get their life assignment. Jonas is selected the receiver of memories.

After receiving some of the memories certain things start happening and Jonas learns things that are not to be learned.

I cherish this book; the way it is written is captivating and the way the story has been constructed is phenomenal! I am twelve and found this book perfect for my age! i don't suggest younger than eleven, as it has things that are hard to handle.

B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Tedious rehash, Godzilla vs. unimaginative human characters. Computer generated monsters fight computerized robots. A real yawner. Very disappointing monster flix pic.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I found the game challenging and enjoyable. The music was relaxing. I would recommend the game to others. The graphics were interesting. Good job!
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Mr Abercrombie writes a mean character. Literally. Crude, rude, vain, tortured. Just a few words used to describe the people that inhabit his world. They feel real and act accordingly.<br /><br />His writing is clear and his action sequences well written. He keeps you interested in the characters. Good thing, because there is little motion around the plot, at least not in the first book.<br /><br />This is great counter programming to the recent trend of maudlin \\"life story\\" fantasies.<br /><br />Darkly visceral...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|And many are here.  Landscapes, portraits, religious, everyday life, impressionist, realist..... styles vary dependent on the need for that setting.  Words used, dripping  the pictures as they go by.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This a fun game for the whole family. I recommend making little bags for the pieces or at least using Baggies.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|used to be a terrific app, but the latest build has made it remarkably useless.  i see the new update comes with the ability to share what i'm listening to facebook.  thanks, but no thanks.  i don't need or want people to see what i'm listening to.  what i want is the old player whose widget worked and that didn't lag when playing from the cloud.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|if anyone had told me what the book was about, i probably wouldn't have ever considered reading it. And to correct virtually every review or comment, the main character Pat, is not mentality ill as much as suffering from a brain injury. Not that the distinction is really important in the course of the story, but it may be more meaningful to some readers to understand that point.<br /><br />I don't like spoilers, so I'll not discuss the story, but only my reaction  after reading it. I will say that the original story is presented differently in the movie,especially the ending. And the ending is the most powerful aspect of this book. To say more about the ending would be the worst kind of spoiler, so I won't.  I will say that in a story that revolves around two characters that most people would call crazy and includes a dramatic modern dance routine, the most vivid imagery is evoked by the description of two people meeting in a nearly deserted park as snow is falling, which says something about the author's wordcraft.  In a similar manner the most memorable lines, which would seem mundane if considered in isolation are elevated to a level that brings to mind Bogart by the depth of emotions they convey coming from the mouths of two broken yet somehow charming people who are determined to build new lives in spite of their respective families plans.<br /><br />Even if You've seen the movie, you should still read the book, because the changes in the storyline and thus the denouement give the original story an equally satisfying ending, but one that is arrived at more honestly and with far more insight that will in turn generate more reflection on the part of the reader. Unlike so many books with their 'happily ever after' endings, this story doesnt promise that everything can be fixed, but it leaves the reader with hope that such a possibility exists.<br /><br />One female friend may have put it best when she told me that Silver Linings Playbook \\"felt like a Nicholas Sparks novel written by a man who wasn't trying so hard to tug at women's heartstrings so he didn't feel the need to tie up everything just so, which made the ending more real, with more pain but more satisfaction too\\".
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another fine story centered on an impressive and engaging character; watching his wit at work is a treat. You'll reread this one.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This movie presented exemplary acting and excellent story content. David Niven, Loretta Young, and Cary Grant were superb. I will add this to my movie library and pass it on to others.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game. No need to spend any money, just be patient and you will receive energy after some time has elapsed. Heavy on hidden objects and different versions of hidden objects, such as silhouette, picture morphs, etc.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|This is a great knife for the survival kit. It is very large and heavily built . Almost to big but serves multiple purposes. The price is very cheep but the knife isn't. Great for bitoning. It can replace an axe. Full tine with good grips. Hi carbine steel for use with flint. Sheath is O.K. with an add on pouch for extra survival gear like fishing kit,  supper glue or other things. But boy is it big! Ramble would be proud. It is great for a real (O s--t situation ) but not practical for EDC.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|I havent played this game yet because it takes forever for the second download i bet this game Is awesome
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|If you're a Harry Hole fan, buy this book.  As good or better than the subsequent books in the series.  Very well written, fast-paced and translated seamlessly (you'd never know it was originally written in another language).  If you haven't yet been introduced to Harry, this is the first in a series, and once you've read this one, I'm reasonably certain that you'll be hooked.  The main character is so interesting and so &#34;human&#34;, yet very unique. Action, mystery, intrigue and a bit of romance--all in a small package easily read and mightily enjoyed.
1439148953|4.0|I turned to this novel because I have heard so much lately about Colm Toibin.  Its simple story line can trick readers into thinking that not much is going to happen.  A young Irishwoman, Eilis, is convinced by her widowed mother and Rose to come to the United States because her small town does not promise her a prosperous future; hence, she does what hundreds of thousands of Europeans--particularly Irish--have done before her:  she sails for New York, and through the help of a priest finds a room in a Brooklyn boarding house as well as a job as a shop girl in a large department store.  What sets the narrative apart is that it is a story of Irish immigration _after_ World War II, rather than during the 1840s and 1850s when so many Irish came to North America.<br /><br />Eilis's success in Brooklyn, including obtaining her certificate in bookkeeping from Brooklyn College, gaining respect as a shop assistant, and beginning to fall in love with a \\"better than gold\\" Italian man, easily lulls readers into thinking that the plot is rather dull, even boring.  It is the final part of the novel when complications begin to set in, some of which are the result of Eilis's youth and naivety, and some which speak more universally to the immigrant experience of how painful and compromising it can be to leave one homeland and create a meaningful life in another.<br /><br />Ultimately, I do not think this story is really about the plot or even really that much about Eilis.  She becomes a sort of Everywoman, and as such, Toibin's novel works as a tribute or perhaps even a memorial, to the collective memories of all immigrants who make it to the United States and stay.  It is a story of how their sacrifices, pain, and ambivalence towards their new homeland ultimately create an American identity, one that is more complicated but also richer than the more simplistic, patriotic story lines that Americans are used to hearing and accepting.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|AS USUAL I WAS NOTDISAPOINTED IN  JOHN GRISHAM. I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!  I HOPE THEY MAKE A MOVIE FROM THE BOOK LIKE THEY DID A TIME TO KILL AND USE THE SAME ACTORS. IT WOULD REALLY BE GREAT. I  RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES JOHN GRISHAM  BOOKS AND EVEN TO THOSE WHO LIKE BOOKS THAT KEEP  YOU SO INTERESTED AND WONDERING WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT THAT YOU  CANNOT PUT THEM DOWN..
B00340LM8C|5.0|A classic film of the 1950's - one of Hitchcock's best! The ice queen, Grace Kelly proves to be smokin' hot in this witty,  sexy thriller. Cary Grant is at his best, charming, self-deprecating and the perfect leading man.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I want more.  Fun puzzle game.  Could use example demo mode to help get you started.<br />Great start to what could easily be one of the best!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I have read most of John Grisham's books and enjoyed most of them.  I borrowed this book from a lending library and am glad that I did not purchase it.  Most of it was very typical of Grisham's work and I appreciate that.  This book did however, bog down in the middle so much that I almost quit.  There were just far too many characters to keep track of.  I stopped, read the reviews here and made myself finish it.  The ending was pretty much what I thought it might be.<br />  Not sure if I'd read another Grisham book in the future.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots of fun, and challenging. Excellent graphics , absolutely recommend.<br />It's fun to choose the right shotgun or riffle. Very realistic scenery. Great to play during commercials while watching tv.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|fun and game runs well my new go to game on my kindle. I would recamend this to anyone that like to play hunting games
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Held my interest.  Different role for Denzel then I've seen before.  He's not usually a drunk in his roles.  Quite a switch.
B00E8S2KV2|4.0|5 discs, hours of extras and you see the entire process from script to casting to filming! It's like you're there!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Predictable in some places...just as the author planned it.  An interesting delve into the human psyche.  No spoiler alert here...just read it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fantastic. but it needs more levels!! I love this game, but it needs more levels!! Need to add more challenging  levels!
B004132HZS|5.0|Any fan of the Sherlock novels series will fall in love with this clever, and in depth reimagining of a classic work of art.  Bold, daring, and modern, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are the new face of this franchise, and bring an indescribable wit and charm to this series and their characters.  A must watch for anyone interested in seeing a good series.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I was expecting better. And a black Moneypenny is totally out of character. I can see going back to the younger characters but this didn't make the cut.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|You can't go wrong when purchasing The Godfather Collection on Blu-ray!  First of all, a movie collector can't call themselves a movie collector without this iconic addition.  The quality of transfer to Blu-ray is top notch and the bonus disc extras really make this purchase worthwhile even if you already have The Godfather Collection on VHS and DVD.  I bought The Godfather Collection for my dad for his birthday and it couldn't have been more well received!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston & Child have written another Pendergast thriller. The book is hard to put down once you have started reading it.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Boyfriend loves this movie. It kept him happy over the holidays. Made a nice Christmas gift and easy to package and ship overseas.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is just a great all around family movie!  I wish they would make more movies like this one...even better that it is based on a true story.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Boyfriend loves this move. Was super cheap, easy to package and rewrap as a Christmas gift for him in Japan.
B009P5K4HK|1.0|My Dad purchased this same double CD at a music store while visiting me from Florida. There aren't any music stores in his area. One of the CDs was defective. He asked me to go back to the store to buy another & ship it to him. I thought it would be quicker to buy from Amazon & have it shipped right out for free (because I am a Prime member). Unfortunately the same CD was defective. We believe there must be some kind of defect with the batch that was manufactured, so we were leery to purchase a third CD set, which is unfortunate because he really enjoyed the music.
B00138GZAC|1.0|It's not the music I dislike, it's the fact that Amazon music doesn't<br />transfer to ITunes.  They say it does, but it has not in my case.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|I love New Girl!  The cast has amazing chemistry and the writing team gives them great material to work with.  Season 1's standout supporting actor was Schmidt, played by Max Greenfield.  You really came to understand the quirks in his personality.  While Schmidt is still hilarious and off-the-wall as ever, Jake Johnson was the real star (for me) of Season 2.  Nick had some great storylines in Season 1, but Season 2 was the season of Nick!  We really got to see him grow, mature, revert back to immature Nick, go through some really tough times, etc.  Nick's character is the guy you can see yourself being really great friends with, and eventually falling for him.  I think the writers did an amazing job handling the Nick / Jess situation as well.  They have unbelievable chemistry and I got butterflies in my stomach during SEVERAL scenes with them together in this season.  Cooler, Parking Spot, Quick Hardening Caulk / Guys Night and Virgins were some of my favorites.  First Date was also a great one, but a little sad for me in the end.  All in all a great season that I look forward to rewatching.<br /><br />ps.  I feel bad for not having mentioned LaMorne Morris's character Winston.  Winston is underrated and I feel that LaMorne truly is a hilarious guy.  I love scenes that he's in and I just think that the entire cast was completely in sync this season.  So great!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Zombies zombies zombies what more can I say...good action good story line...its nothing like the book but I have to say I thought this movie was going to be horrible...It turned out to be pretty good.
