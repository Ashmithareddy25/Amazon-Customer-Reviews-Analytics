0790749815|5.0|Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST (NbyNW) is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soign&eacute;e Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My hubby and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments; if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, \\"Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?\\" they would immediately reply, \\"No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you.\\" :-) NbyNW also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores. Anybody who wants to write or direct a chase thriller should watch NbyNW first to see how it's done, and the DVD is a great place to start with its superb extras, like the documentary and Lehman's commentary track! I'm only sorry they couldn't include the Oscar-nominated short documentary THE MAN ON LINCOLN'S NOSE as well.
B0000025RI|5.0|Thriller is undoubtly the best of Micheal Jacksons work if they had a little more like Bad and other songs this would be the best pop soundtrack.

What a weird but great mix. <br />Billie Jean- The song he is most famous for his moonwalk. <br />P.Y.T-A fast beat a great love song. <br />Micheal Jackson wouldn't be made fun of if it weren't for that stupid nose and white skin.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|It is entirely possible that Will Ferrell will never have another role as perfect as that of Buddy the Elf in \\"Elf\\" for the rest of his film career.  This is just a case of perfect casting, which is critical for any film that wants to tell you the story of a 6' 3½\\" inch human being who thinks he is one of Santa's elves.  Ferrell strikes the perfect note of earnest naïvet&eacute; for most of the film and manages to stay endearing without becoming obnoxious (although the syrup on spaghetti bit is toeing the line for my money).  From the moment he appears full sized, you are sold on Ferrell's Buddy and whatever failings this 2003 holiday comedy has, it has nothing to do with his performance.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Elf\\" is that one Christmas many years ago Santa Clause (Ed Asner) left an orphanage with a small passenger in his sack of toys.  Since Santa obviously has a warm spot in his heart for children, little Buddy is adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and raised as an Elf despite the fact that he is twice as big as his adopted father by the time he is four.  But Buddy does not know that he is adopted until he overhears the other elves talking about the problems with an \\"elf\\" who can only make 85 Etch-a-Sketches a day instead of 200.  Once he knows the truth, Buddy heads to New York City and the Empire State Building, where his father, Walter Hobbes (James Caan) works.  The only thing that Buddy knows about his father is that he is on Santa's naughty list; he does not know that Walter has a wife, Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and a son, Michael (Daniel Tay).<br /><br />\\"Elf\\" is a film that is really geared for children, which is a polite way of saying that the script by David Berenbaum keeps things simple for the kiddies as it goes through all of the expected scenes as Buddy turns rough beginnings with his father and Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), the cute girl dressed up as an elf at Gimbels.  The publishing house that Walter works for is in desperate need for an idea for a great children's book, and if you do not know where that idea is going to come from then you have simply not been around long enough to have seen enough of these films to figure it all out before the end.  Hiring Asner and Newhart is great, but giving them better scenes and dialogue would have been even better.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more of Buddy's little animated friends and a lot less of the Central Park Rangers (What is up with having New York Police Officers be the \\"villains\\" in a post 9/11 movie?  Bah Humbug, people).<br /><br />But the premises are certainly there to be developed into more memorable scenes.  For example, Buddy might have been a human in an elf's world, but he is a serious thrower of snow balls and only needs forty minutes of sleep a night, which gives him lots of time to do Christmas decorations.  The latter comes up with a memorable scene early on, but is then reduced to being just a running gag.  Yet for most of the film the idea that Buddy has a touch of magic is ignored.  Obviously the fish out of water/stranger in a strange land bits are a large part of the film, but this just emphasizes this film is geared for elf sized children.  I think it could have been even more enchanting if it had raised its sights slightly higher.<br /><br />The other major problem with \\"Elf\\" is that the least interesting relationship is between Buddy and his father, where there is just no chemistry.  The scenes with Jovie are a lot more touching, there is not enough of Faizon Love as the manager at Gimbel's who thinks Buddy is working him, Amy Sedaris is pretty much wasted as Walter's secretary Deb, and Steenburgen simply puts Caan to shame every time they have a scene together.  If I had to make a choice between recasting the role of Walter or reworking the script, I am not sure which way I would go.  The former would be the cheap fix, but the character and cast are good enough that tinkering with the script could have increased the chancesof \\"Elf\\" being the modern Christmas classic it wants to be.<br /><br />Still, kids will love the film, and adults will find enough to laugh at and enough gentle tugs of the heartstrings to make it worth the viewing.  But it is just not up to the level of a perennial film for the holiday season.  Besides, since this an Infinifilm DVD it is loaded with lots of goodies for movie fans to enjoy (I especially liked just listening to kids talk about elves, Santa's sleigh, the North Pole, etc.).  I am starting to get good at navigating through all the options and have actually developed a preference jumping in and out of the extra scenes the second time I go through the film.  Final Note: I am sure most of your figured out that Leon Redbone was doing the voice of Leon the Snowman, but the voice of the Polar Bear Cub was the master of stop motion animation, Ray Harryhausen.assic it wants to be.

B00005JLZN|4.0|There is a problem with reviewing \\"The Life of David Gale\\" because I was not fooled for a second.  I saw the whole thing coming, based on the key reason that David Gale (Kevin Spacey) decided to talk to reporter Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet), and what Governor Hardin (Michael Crabtree) says to shut Gale up in a televised debate on the death penalty.  That means for most of this 131-minute movie from director Alan Parker I am waiting for the characters to catch up.  However, I do not want to suggest that the problem is that Charles Randolph's script telegraphs everything, but rather that in this era of twisted tales such as \\"The Crying Game,\\" \\"Usual Suspects,\\" \\"Memento,\\" you are always on your guard and never accept a narrative at face value.<br /><br />Basically, \\"The Life of David Gale\\" is a death row story, but more like \\"True Crime\\" than \\"The Chamber,\\" \\"The Green Mile,\\" or \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" which means it is mystery-thriller.  Days before his execution in Texas, Gale's attorney contacts Bloom's magazine about his first and only story from prison.  Gale was a professor of philosophy (just like the writer) at a major Texas university and a major voice in the (fictional) anti-death penalty group Death Watch along with his friend, Constance Hallaway (Laura Linney).  But then his life implodes when one of his students (Rhona Mitra) has sex with him in a bathroom during a college party and then cries rape.  His wife leaves with his son, he is put on permanent sabbatical, and Death Watch wants nothing to do with him.  When Connie is found dead he is tried, convicted for rape and murder, and sentence to death.  His lawyer, Braxton Belyeu (Leon Rippy), seems to be taking the whole thing rather calmly and a cowboy (Matt Craven) in a pick up truck keep following Bitsey and Zack Stemmons (Gabirel Mann), the intern the magazine has sent to be her gopher and pseudo-muscle.  Obviously there is something here to be found out by Bitsey and besides the question of what it is there is the one about whether she will find it out in time.<br /><br />I am somewhat concerned with the way this movie will be read in decidedly different ways by viewers totally dependent on their beliefs regarding capital punishment.  I would think that few people who endorse or oppose the death penalty will change their view after watching \\"The Life of David Gale,\\" and I fear that those who are still in the process of making up their mind may well be tipped in a direction other than what the writer and director intended, although clearly Parker does try to present both sides of the debate on their own ground.  At the end of this one you might be wondering if what you are thinking is what you are supposed to be thinking, or if the final irony undermines the entire endeavor.<br /><br />The film is set in Texas, where over half of the inmates executed in the United States each year have their sentences carried out.  But Texas is not really representative of where the national debate is on capital punishment because no other state does as much to facilitate death sentences and executions (e.g., the definition of mental illness precludes Andrea Yates using an insanity defense in her trial even though the jury that convicted her and sentenced her to life in prison instead of death felt she was insane).  In this film the complex issue is reduced to sound bites for and against by ordinary citizens and the question of whether the execution of one innocent person would justify shutting down the entire system.<br /><br />Consequently, there is a sense in which the morality of a film that uses such volatile issues as backdrop is ultimately suspect.  When I try to come to terms with the issue of capital punishment I know that on one side there is the impulse when I hear of some heinous crime to wish the cruel and unusual punishment clause was not in the Constitution.  But on the other side there is the dwindling list of nations still using the death penalty and I do not like theUnited States being associated with the practices of totalitarian nations.  Then there are the economic concerns of how much it costs to execute one condemned prisoner, money that could be spent to hire more police officers or buy body armor or other things that could reduced the number of murders in the future, not to mention the idea that life without parole served in the general prison population could be a punishment worse than death.<br /><br />All of these points are debatable, and while many are touched on in this film they are but touched upon.  However, in the final analysis I must also admit that since there was no mystery here as far as I was concerned, these other elements stood out more for me as well.  The performances by Winslet, Spacey, and Linney are what you would expect, and if you are familiar with Parker's other films (e.g., \\"The Commitments,\\" \\"Evita\\") then you will recognize the editing style and use of montages in this one.  However, you will have to decide if \\"The Life of David Gale\\" is too heavy handed, or if I just happened to immediately stumble upon the key clues to unraveling the mystery.ike the United States being associated with the practices of totalitarian nations.

B000268QB2|4.0|Sensuous British mope-rock is alive and well, as Brit-pop trio Keane makes their debut with \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" Strong, soaring vocals from Tom Chaplin are backed up by some solid piano-based pop and rock. Despite constant comparisons to Travis, Radiohead and Coldplay, Keane shows plenty of promise and originality.<br /><br />It starts off with a strong piano solo in the quiet \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" followed by a stream of catchy pop like the thoughtful \\"Everybody's Changing\\" and the shimmery \\"Bend And Break,\\" and gossamer ballads like the melancholy \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" and soaring \\"She Has No Time.\\" It wraps up on a strong note with the plaintive \\"Bedshaped.\\"<br /><br />If any British band breaks the rock mold, it seems to be labelled as a Radiohead/Coldplay wannabe. On some superficial levels, Keane sounds rather like those bands. But it manages to remain a bit apart, rocking a bit harder and sounding a bit more straightforward and simple. It's hard to truly classify Keane as really being pop -- the lack of guitar and the prevailing piano seem to edge its catchy melodies closer to classical pop.<br /><br />The first thing to know about Keane is: No guitarist. Don't let it scare you -- the mix of rippling piano and gentle percussion are enough to make their melodies catchy without electric riffs. At the same time, they take some musical risks in \\"Untitled 1.\\" Psychedelic piano-pop? Believe it or not, Keane does that.<br /><br />Tom Chaplin's vocals are the strongest point of Keane's lineup; his solid, high soars along with the shimmery music. At times his vocals get a bit TOO high, like when he sings the title line of \\"She Has No Time,\\" but most of the time he manages to sound like a heartbroken guy exorcising his breakup demons. The songs themselves aren't terribly complex or insightful, but they can be quite poignant: \\"And if you have a minute why don't we go/talk about it somewhere only we know?/This could be the end of everything/so why don't we go/somewhere only we know?\\"<br /><br />Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into greatness. But in \\"Hopes And Fears,\\" they have succeeded in the basics: bringing forth some beautiful, sometimes heartrending music.Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into greatness.

When Joel learns how far her impulsive behavior can go (which he tells her time and again is what he likes about her), he decides to go through a similar procedure.  Midway through the procedure, he decides that he does not want to let go of he memories with her and struggles in his mind to bring her back to him.  Well this part you will figure out after a good 30 mins or more of the movie has passed.  What this movie initially requires is patience and rewards you with a fascinating turn of events.<br /><br />You walk away from the movie full of thoughts about what you would do if such opportunity were granted to you! The answer lies within the story; every memory - no matter how painful it is - is worthy.  You will question the basis of the relationships.  What brings two people together: destiny, fate, chance, or maybe you just belong together!  Watch this movie - it could be a life experience.

I still like sehnsucht the best,because I like the catchier riffs. The new album sounds like a better version of mutter. It's still heavy and uses a lot of symphony and violins as backround effects. Another thing I like is the album is melodic.I would recomend this album but if your like me and you like there old stuff dont expect this album to sound old school.
B00000I4XR|4.0|When director Steven Spielberg set out to create the motion picture \\"Jaws\\", he had no idea how much trouble the film would cause him nor just how incredible, exciting, and important it would eventually become. <br />The film ventures into the world of Amity Island, which is feverishly awaiting its July 4th holiday weekend to create quite a business for the town. But when a flesh-eating Great White shark enters the town's beaches, it is up to the town sherriff (Roy Scheider in perhaps his best performance outside of \\"The French Connection\\"), a geeky graduate scientist (the always admirable Richard Dreyfuss), and the town fish gamer (played by Robert Shaw, the film's best performance by far) to save the day. <br />Spielberg plays the tension like a sneaky household cat ready to pounce on a silly toy. He knows exactly when his temptations will take over and when he will strike, but the audience is left to guess in fear as the shark terrorizes the small island. What makes \\"Jaws\\" so great is not just the fine soundtrack by John Williams, the special effects and the lovable shark machine \\"Bruce\\", but the fact that it allows the childish fears in all of us to creep up on us and still make the hair on our necks tingle. <br />Spielberg would later create even more popular and elaborate masterpieces such as \\"E.T\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", but for those who truly enjoy film and its impact on an audience, \\"Jaws\\" can certainly bite with the best of them.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Only five years ago I was somewhat despondent about the state of rock music. Relatively little exciting new music was being produced compared with previous decades in the history of rock. But the past few years has seen an explosion of really fine bands from all over the planet, not merely from around the U.S. and England, but in every area of Europe and, as in the case of Arcade Fire, Canada. Most of these bands tend to fall into either of two categories: back to roots bands (usually European, where they go back almost to garage roots, and bands that synthesize much of the history of rock to create their own unique mixture. Arcade Fire clearly belongs to the latter. Like a band like Modest Mouse, Arcade Fire constantly reminds you of other bands. Most frequently I'm reminded of the Pixies and Talking Heads, but almost as often I hear echoes of Roxy Music, Joy Division, or even David Bowie and Brian Eno.<br /><br />As anyone knows who has heard anything at all about this album, it was produced shortly after members of the band suffered the deaths of several family members in less than a month. This clearly gives the album not merely its title, but a lot of its urgency and focus. The album doesn't, however, deal with death (like Lou Reed's LOVE AND MAGICK does, for instance) but with love and life. The heart of the album is the quartet of the songs that share the title \\"Neighborhood.\\" They take up four of the first five tracks on the album, and each one is utterly splendid in its own way. I might have a slight preference for the first one, subtitled \\"Tunnels,\\" but if you ask me on a different listening I might opt for another. The album hardly slows down after that quartet of songs is finished (and for the record, the 3rd cut, \\"Une Ann&eacute;e Sans Lumi&egrave;re,\\" is one of the stronger cuts on the album, and the one that immediately follows the final \\"Neighborhood\\" song, \\"Crown of Love,\\" is another amazingly strong number. If the album fades at all (and compared to most other recent rock albums, even good ones, it doesn't), it is near the end. But even then, the next to last cut on the album, \\"Rebellion (Lies),\\" is as good as anything the album contains.<br /><br />One thing that marks nearly every song on the album is the wonderful way that they employ contrasts. Most songs build rather slowly, to build up to a glorious, powerful crescendo. Many of the songs have a kind of majesty that many heavy metal bands, for instance, strive for, but rarely achieve. One thing, however, that sets them apart from many of the bands I mentioned as possible influences is that they have a very powerful, dynamic rhythm section. I absolutely adore the Pixies, but they almost intentionally submerge the rhythm section in the music. In Arcade Fire, despite all of the musical trappings, the drums and bass propel the song forward, and in the many songs where the tension and tempo build, they always lead the charge. Just listen to \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" and watch how the rhythm section controls the song.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best debut albums in recent years, and I eagerly await their next album. As I write this review, I am only a few days away from seeing these guys live in Chicago at the Logan Square Theater.<br /><br />Note: Big thanks to my brother for calling my attention to these guys.r recent rock albums, even good ones, it doesn't), it is near the end.

B0001FR3IQ|3.0|What a spooky setting. Unfortunately, that's the scariest part of this movie, where and how it takes place. It could've been so good (if it weren't for the many unanswered questions and plot holes). But it seemed to be lacking something. It throws you into a nightmare before you really have a chance to care about any of the characters. It does happen along the way towards the end though. And somehow manages to be somewhat powerful. Near the end you kind of have a feeling what might happen (even if you can't quite predict exactly how). This movies tries too hard to be scary at the wrong moments. But in the end, turns out to be a decent story. The idea (for me about watching movies) is to escape reality for a while, and this sure took me away (to a place I wouldn't want to be for too long). This stayed with me a while after seeing it. \\"You can't trust someone who thinks you're crazy.\\" Great line. This was a cryptic but entertaining ride, one that's worth seeing.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I had never seen an episode of \\"Everwood\\" before, but the premise intrigued me. A renowned brain surgeon moving to the middle of nowhere after his wife dies to establish new ties, build a new family, and perhaps forget past failures. Treat Williams is excellent as Dr. Andy Brown, a talented surgeon who treats his patients better than his own children. Andy is neglectful, but not intentionally. His absence from his children's lives is maybe an admission that he has not clue how to relate to them. Watching him bond reluctantly with his hostile son is one of the many pleasures of this delicate, intelligently-written show.  <br />     Dr. Brown is an affable man, yet flawed, which makes him instantly recognizable. His struggles to properly raise his son and daughter form the core of \\"Everwood\\". Williams anchors the show with his vivid, tortured protrayal of a man with internal demons hidden by a calm facade. He's the type of man one would enjoy inviting to a poker game, a basketball tournament, or a beer in the local bar. His son Ephram, played by the amazing Gregory Smith, is a gifted pianist who clashes with his father over issues of desertion and emotional detachment. Watching them spar and yell and eventually come to a greater understanding of each other is an almost religious experience. Ephram challenges his father to see if he really cares. and his testing brings the family close to the verge of an emotional meltdown. He's the type of adolescent who is fiercely loyal to his friends, sees through the transparency of phony peers, and is uncompromising in his demands for basic decency. The daughter, Delia, is a sweet kid who just wants to fit in at school, but has a tough time adjusting to the almost alien climate of Everwood. <br />     The subplots are compelling, the supporting cast uniformly superb, and the character interactions credible. The season finale builds suspense so brilliantly it's almost painful to watch. After viewing the final episode, I regretted that I would have to part company with these special people, at least for a short time (which means that either the writers did a stellar job or I need to get out and socialize more!). \\"Everwood\\" makes you cherish the people you take for granted in everyday life, whether they're brain surgeons, grocery checkers, or the kid that delivers your morning newspaper.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I won't write a story about this movie, I'll make it short for you. This movie is a classic, must have collection. It's a good movie about a mermaid who falls in love with a boy, who she then meet again when there all grown up as a coincidence. She falls in love with him over again, as if this was her destiny she looks for him and both of there worlds are turned up side down, with laughs and tears you can't hold back, this movie is pure enjoyment. This movie is really good, so you watch it now and conclude the rest.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|In general found the bulk of this entertaining as I had missed much of the concert when it originaly aired. Queen really stole the show. There were a couple of stinkers like R.E.O. Speedwagon and the Thompson Twins with Madonna...bad. Speaking of Madonna it was quite shocking to see how far she has come since very early in her career. As previous viewers have mentioned there are a few glitches but for the price and the cause it is a home run.
B000089CJI|5.0|i love this cd. its a great colaboration between two great bands. its sounds like death cab except up beat and techno. ben gibbard's voice is amazing and some reviewer had the nerve to say otherwise saying that the postal service needs to hire a real singer. to this i say you need to clean your ears out. his voice is very unique and amazing. this is a great band and the music just makes you feel very happy.
B000002LE6|4.0|I became a Prince fan through \\"Gold Experience\\" and \\"The Love Symbol Album\\", so.. that might tell you something about my preferences. And just for the record - I think \\"Sign 'O' the Times\\" will always remain his finest, whereas \\"Purple Rain\\" one of his most overrated.    Now that we've got that out the way, let's become \\"Lovesexy\\", shall we? In 1988 Prince followed \\"Sign 'O' the Times\\" with a stunning album, depicting love.. no.. sex as Heaven. Or Hell, this album actually makes its listener reconsider certain choices. So, if you're not into the spiritual, chances are you won't like this. If you are, don't let the album cover turn you off - Prince is merely playing Adam here. No shame, return to the innocence, Genesis chapters 1 and 2.. you get the point.    Apart from the album being a lyrical paradize (the line in \\"Positivity\\", where Prince sings \\"don't kiss the beast, hold on to your soul\\" alone is worth the $10 it costs these days), \\"Lovesexy\\" has some of his all-time finest music. \\"I know\\", \\"Alphabet St.\\", \\"Glam Slam\\" are all killer grooves. \\"Dance on\\" is about war and is pure, HARDCORE funk, about as bad*ss as it gets. \\"Anna Stesia\\" nicely complements all of the above with a subdued performance and an intimate message.    The real masterpieces, however, are \\"When 2 R in Love\\" (1 of Prince's best ballads.. gotta love the lyric \\"let me touch your body till your river's an ocean\\") and \\"I wish you heaven\\" - a pop gem every bit as good as \\"Purple Rain\\" and \\"Gold\\", in other words, epic. I dare you not to be moved by these two.    Very firm 4 stars. And, it grows on you.    ~O~
B000068G9X|5.0|Danzig has never topped his debut album.  He has equalled it, but never topped it.  This is the cd that will make you a Danzig fan, not any of his later ones.  This one is just simple bluesy metal- no razzle dazzle, no B.S.  And I believe this cd has a record number of \\"yeahs\\" on it.  A few years back during one of my dating dry spells I had nothing better to do than count the number of times Glenn said \\"Yeah\\" on this album.  It's been many years, but I believe the number is either 68 or 63.  And contrary to some beliefs, I don't find this album boring at all.  No matter how hard I try, it just doesn't bore me.  I had the pleasure of being corrupted by this album at the age of 12 when I caught the video for She Rides.  My knowledge of metal was limited back then and I can still remember being confused by the video.  I see this musclebound Conan-looking dude singing like Elvis Presley with girls dancing all around him and I thought to myself, \\"Who the hell is this guy?\\"  I'm glad I explored that further coz I became a huge Danzig fan after that.  That is up until his ego kicked the band members out.  I liked these band members, I liked John Christ just as much as Danzig.  Then Glenn thought he could just record any crap and his devoted fans would buy it.  Not this fan, NOSIREEBOB.  My advice to a newcomer is to grab this cd first, then work your way up to Danzig 4, then for god's sake leave them alone!  Go back and get Misfits and Samhain albums.  But there's no denying just how great this debut is.  If you really want to treat yourself to something special, get up off your Hostess behind and get this sucker.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|this film was a snoozer. I have no idea why it got so much critical acclaim. Look, I love character-driven films. Unlike what some people here have said, I have indeed traveled abroad, have found myself alone in a foreign country, and I don't live in \\"middle America,\\" I live in New York City and I see plenty of art house films. And yet I still didn't get this film. Go figure. <br /> <br />Why? There's very little character development. I couldn't see why Bob and Charlotte were drawn together. Their relationship didn't evolve at all. You can do character development with very little dialogue and without tons of plot if you know what you're doing, which the director obviously didn't. Bob's phone calls to his wife were much more interesting than his interactions with Charlotte  because they illustrated the problems in their marriage. Charlotte's call to her friend at home was insightful, as well.  <br /> <br />If you want a sweet movie that features two characters coming together and forming a bond, watch Garden State. Like this one, it was beautifully shot and has good music, but unlike this film, you could actually see the characters developing. If you want a film about unrequited love with very understated acting, rent The Remains of the Day with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.  <br /> <br />Bill Murray is great in this, but he's still doing the same dry schitck he's been doing for 30 years. Scarlett Johansen was great, too. They just didn't have much to work with. Also, tangents would start and then be dropped. Charlotte's photographer husband didn't want her to come to dinner with him and his ex-girlfriend. Was he planning cheating on her or what?? I don't mind understated films, but loose ends are another thing. <br /> <br />On the upside, this film did look gorgeous; some of the shots were composted beautifully. The music was good, as well. And I was very, very thankful that Bob and Charlotte never slept together. But those good points don't make up for the fact that nothing happens, not even character or relationship development, in this overrated, pretentious film.
B00003CXXP|5.0|As the decade is winding down to the half-way mark I will say in all honesty that this may be one of the best pictures of the new century.  I am hopeful in years to come that people will come to appreciate this collaboration between directors Steven Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick.  This story was originally conceived by Kubrick and in his inherent wisdom he did not feel that he had the right mindset to direct this film.  Kubrick was a tad cynical about humanity whereas Spielberg was a bit more optimistic about mankind.  Spielberg imbued this film with a heart that Kubrick could not.  The story, about a robot who is programmed to love and then discarded when he becomes an inconvenience is a good one.  The odyssey that the robot,(Haley Joel Osment), takes is fraught with wonder and pitfalls in his search for the elusive \\"Mommy\\"(Frances O'Connor).  The art direction and special effects here are spell-binding as well as another solid score from John Williams.  The film would not work if not for the impeccable acting of Osment who, as the central character of this film, has to make you believe in \\"David\\".  The work he does here is more impressive than his Oscar nominated turn in \\"The Sixth Sense\\".  If his character is unbelievable the film just plain doesn't work.  O'Connor does a solid turn as \\"Mommy\\".  Jude Law gives another outstanding character turn as \\"Gigolo Joe\\", the pleasure android.  Also, I just adored the robot toy \\"Teddy\\".  I wish I could get one for Christmas.  This is a film where audiences(and critics) had certain pre-conceived expectations and may have been disappointed with what was delivered.  I think viewers should re-visit(or visit) \\"A.I.\\" and just accept it for what it is.
B00004RFFW|5.0|Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are probably the best \\"buddy\\" film duo in action films.  Their on screen chemistry lights up the screen and they are truly gifted actors to take these roles and elevate them to not only good action heroes, but good actors as well.  Director Richard Donner is back in this second film, and the action starts out fast and furious with an incredible multi-car chase and never lets up.  Gibson is as \\"stressed\\" as ever, although he seems to have channeled it better, until a key plot revelation about his wife's death turns him into a walking timebomb.<br /><br />This sequel is harsher than the original, with a lot of carnage and much of the action towards the end borders on cruel retribution.  A lot of the policemen bite the dust, without telling too much Riggs' newest love interest doesn't last too long, and Gibson meets Derrick O'Connor in a vicious showdown in which Mel doesn't come out too well.<br /><br />However, this is what action movies are all about and the film is a blistering, adrenaline pumped winner.  Joss Ackland is maliciously repugnant as the South African diplomat; Derrick O'Connor ranks up there with the nastiest of James Bond villains, and the irascible Joe Pesci is brilliant as the protected witness our boys are assigned to protect.<br /><br />A top notch entry in the series, but be warned---this one isn't pretty.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The film focuses on a man named Jeff \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski ( Jeff Bridges). The Dude is a man that spends his days smoking weed and bowling. The story kicks into action when a pair of thugs, break into his apartment and mistake The Dude for a millionaire with the same name. The thugs demand money, and to get their point across, one of them ruins The Dude's favorite rug by urinating on it. When The Dude discovers that there is a millionaire with his name, he attempts to seek compensation in the form of a new rug. The millionaire refuses to give The Dude a new rug and claims that it is not his fault. Shortly after, the millionaire's young wife (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, and the millionaire agrees to give The Dude a new rug if he helps to get his wife back. The Dude sets out to save the millionaire's wife with the help of his best friend Walter(John Goodman) and soon finds himself thrust into a world of violence and intrigue that upsets his easy going way of life.  <br /> <br />Only the Cohen Brothers could come up with a film like this. The story, wide variety of interesting characters, and the overall uniqueness that the film posesses provide for a funny and enjoyable film. Jeff Bridges gives the best performance of his career as The Dude. His extremely laid back and lazy lifestyle will have you laughing for the majority of the film. The character is so lazy, that he writes a check for 69 cents at one point in the film. Jeff Bridges nailed the role so well that you would think that he really smokes. John Goodman gives one of the best, if not the best role of his career as The Dude's best friend and Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak. Walter's unique viewers on life and his constant use of profanity will have you cracking up for the whole movie. Some other great performances came from John Turturo as an eccentric bowler named Jesus and Juliane Moore as an erotic artist named Maude whose art consists of lying naked on a canvas. I was also particulary impressed with the camera work in this movie. At times, the camera offers a view from inside the holes of a bowling ball.  <br /> <br />The Big Lebowski is probably one of the funniest and most creative films that I have ever seen. Despite the fact that the film appears to be stupid on paper, the actors involved and other unique aspects of this movie will keep you laughing and entertained for the entire film. The DVD is worth the money because the Cohen Brothers talk for a solid 30 minutes on the making of \\"The Big Lebowski\\".  <br /> <br />A solid 5 stars...
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This is an excellent overview of the KING OF POP's career. It gives the listner almost every important song except for a select few. And it comes with a wonderful DVD. I counted over 20 people that passed out in the crowd and had to be carried off...it was insane the way the crowd reacted to Michael. It's a wonderful buy and the packaging is just beautiful!!! Pick it up today, you won't regret it !!!!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|All the songs that you could imagine are on this! This man is a living legend, and has inspired many, as well as going on to be the biggest selling solo artist of all time, with over 380 million records sold to his name. <br /> <br />The best tracks are \\"We've Had Enough\\" and \\"The Way You Love Me\\"...which is obviously some of the new recorded songs on this. Others include songs from the Wiz Soundtrack, and unreleased songs: \\"Sunset Driver, Scared of the Moon, Cheater, Someone Put Your Hand Out, FAll Again, In The Back, Beautiful Girl, His Own Version of \\"We Are The World\\", Who Is IHS Remix.\\" <br /> <br />The ultimate greatest hit is \\"Stranger In Moscow\\", which itself is enough to buy! Buy this. You won't regret it.
B0000646UN|4.0|Never been to war; don't want to go to war but for some reason I don't mind watching war.  This is a truly good look at the horror of battle. <br /> <br />Set in 1939 an out manned and out gunned Finland is facing invasion by its big bully neighbor the Soviet Union.  Perhaps this is one of the appeals.  The common struggling man on the farm takes up arms to defend country and a way of life.  I was sucked in to the determination and fear that the characters were feeling. <br /> <br />Pekka Parikka's portrayal of battle was brutal and very believable.  Man against man, man against tank, hand to hand, in trenches, artillery bursts, strafing from the air, this movie has it all. <br /> <br />And beyond the action we see a relative calm sadness at home.  We see the families broken, returning wounded, and the funerals. <br /> <br />Very nice film for a war voyeur.  Well done.
B00005JL2O|4.0|It's apparent from this film that Mike Myers is growing tired of the Austin Powers character.  However, there is still plenty of gas left in Dr. Evil's tank.  The partnership between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me(Vern Troyer) is still a laugh riot.  The film introduces neglectful daddy issues i.e. Austin's daddy (Michael Caine) always ignored him and Scott(Seth Green) is still trying to impress Dr. Evil.  Caine is reasonably funny here.  Beyonce Knowles is charming as Foxxy Cleopatra.  The opening scene of the film is classic with surprise cameos.  To the film's detriment the Goldmember character is just gross.  And more than the other films, Myers relies on too much toilet humor.
B00062ZE44|5.0|The best album W.T. has produced up to date. Really. If you are a fan of previous albums, you're going to love this. This is also better produced than the earlier albums, so if you are a W.T. novice, this is a great place to start listening to them. Rates high above competitors like Nightwish or Lacuna Coil.
B0000262QW|4.0|The picture of the bird gliding over the surface of the water is about as honest advertisement for the album as could be made.  The music is at once light and graceful yet the reality is that there is a lot of work going on here.  Back in 1972 when this was released, this album could have passed as \\"new age\\" except there was no such phrase at the time.  But RETURN TO FOREVER was in perfect keeping with the image ECM had at the time of high quality playing matched with a somewhat removed and austere air.<br /><br />But in keeping with the image of \\"effortless gliding\\" these four selections tend to put the listener in a relaxed, light and breezy mood.  This is saying something because if you actually focus on the music it is quite busy and jam packed with twists and turns along with a distinct \\"Latin\\" feel.  Chick Corea keeps to the electric keyboard as he used under Miles Davis.  Joe Farrell uses both a set of flutes and saxophones to good effect and yet it never strikes one that this is a \\"saxophone\\" album.  Stanley Clarke and Airto Moreira give a jazz lesson in performing rhythm with taste and in complete service to the band leader.  And Flora Purim (never particularly one of my favorites) sings on only two occasions during this album and actually manages to blend her vocals with her band mates in such a way that they become a part of the brew rather than a noise standing apart.<br /><br />That all being said, this is still very much Corea's album and stands as one of the best he has ever made.  Given somewhat to \\"free jazz\\" in the past, Corea returned to popular appeal by making a record that was easy to understand and yet off the beaten path.  This has over the years led some to dismiss RETURN TO FOREVER as a piece of fluff-ear candy for the more \\"shallow\\" jazz audience.<br /><br />The only thing one can say to this kind of snobbery is:  \\"if it's so easy you do it.\\"  But easy or not, it will reward you with each listening.
B000003B6J|5.0|this is the original westside music. you cant give this no less than 5 stars, if i could id give it more. everyone on this cd can spit no matter how they do it. man im tellin u this is the real rap/hip-hop music, nothin like today. not a rap fan if u dont have this. and dont by the remastered stuff, by the original released. its straight outta compton PEACE. i cant put the pac line on this one, because they were the original...
B0001HAISG|5.0|Now for a very unorganised review that jumps around alot. <br /> <br />Aside from the sketchy CGI sequences, Ludivine Sagnier, that annoying parrot and the child actor that played Pan I would say that this movie was an absolute wonder. I adored the book and this make of the movie as well. <br /> <br />Maybe it is just my obsession with Jason Issacs, but I thought Captain Hook was absolutely fantastic, certainly the best character this film had to offer. <br /> <br />Ludivine Sagnier as Tink absolutely pissed me off... She totally destroyed the character, Tink. <br /> <br />The parrot... should be put out of it's misery. <br /> <br />Why was Pan about as British as Brittany Spears? Honestly, that Jeremy Sumpter child was absolutely dreadful, very cute, but his lisp and most of his acting was appalling... Though I didn't mind much, Jason Issacs as hook made up for any and all of the movie's flaws. (Hell, Issacs, aside from Peter Pan being one of my favourite stories, was my main reason for going to see this movie while it was in the theatre.) <br /> <br />The music was fantastic, my CD of it has been played so much that it is horribly worn and I am now in need of a replacement. The music brings about so much emotion... oh the emotion... <br /> <br />I think my favourite scene was when Wendy and Peter are dancing and Hook is watching them and talking to Tink (though Tink tried to ruin my enjoyment by acting very annoying.) I throughly enjoyed every scene with Hook except for his defeat in the end... I was sad to see him go, but so the tale goes. <br /> <br /> <br />A wonderful, wonderful film!
B00001QEE7|5.0|I was ready to buy it from you and a note came up saying it couldn't be shipped to Central America. I don't understand why, I can see DVD's from zone 1 and zone 4. I always purchase movies from you, I recently purchased Shrek 2 and Aladdin, which I am expecting to come soon. Please! let us get them here, the same happened with 2 computer games from the learning Company I wanted for my daughter.
B00005JMXX|4.0|The movie is nothing special as far as movies go.  It does an ok job of showing the epic wrath of the storm it depicts while keeping a personal touch with the main characters.  The acts of heroism seem quite insignificant considering the scope of the desctruction and severity of the situation and could probably been edited out as they didn't really seem to fit the movie for some reason.<br /><br />Where this movie really shines is it's superb DTS 5.1 audio track.  If you're watching the movie without it you will be severely distanced from it and probably bored to death.  If you're watching in 5.1 you'll be looking outside to see if the world is still there when it's over.<br /><br />If you have a DTS capable system I would recommend you at least rent this film just to hear it as it probably has the best audio of any film ever.  Films like the new Star Wars films have exceptional audio clarity but their stories lacked the opportunity to do what Day After Tommorow has done with surround sound perfectly.
B000001EQT|4.0|In the UK, T. Rex had nine top ten hits between 1970 and 1973, including four No. 1's. Unfortunately T. Rexmania never really caught on in the U.S. Marc Bolan's lone top 40 hit was \\"Bang a Gong\\" from his classic ELECTRIC WARRIOR album in 1972. He was a superstar in the U.K. and little more than a footnote in the U.S., and that's a shame.<br /><br />Bolan's follow-up to ELECTRIC WARRIOR, was the equally amazing THE SLIDER.  The album kicks off with the electric boogie of \\"Metal Guru\\" (a U.K. No. 1) and doesn't let go.  Other classic T. Rex songs are \\"Rock On,\\" \\"The Slider,\\" \\"Baby Boomarang\\" and \\"Telegram Sam\\" (another U.K. No. 1). This reissue concludes with three bonus tracks recorded during the original sessions for THE SLIDER.  Bottom line?  If you enjoyed ELECTRIC WARRIOR, you'll want this album as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00068IOWM|1.0|This album makes me feel sick. It's quite easy to reply to all fans who don't like this new album (including me) writing things like \\"they don't know about music, they don't like U2, they hate U2\\" but all that is false. Every fan here loves U2, but many ones think U2 is going down and down. Expressing disagreement with this below average album doesn't mean that one hates the band, is just disagreement with this commercial, poor and recycled music way. This album is nothing but biggest U2 mistake ever.
0071373586|5.0|<br />Al Ries writes the what marketing is, like a poem of Edgar Allan Poe. In a very simple, easy to read way, very short, but includes a lot of thinking. This book does include more marketing insight than Kotler's thousand pages. I recommend every new starter in marketing department in our company, to firstly read that book, and discuss with me after reading. <br />(and after 2 years of time, when the company makes the person blind)
B00005B36H|5.0|I've read ten or so bad reviews of this album, and you all have convinced me... you're not Tool fans. So what are you doing posting here? All you're doing is letting us know that we don't respect your opinions. There is no band around now (or maybe ever, given the exception of the Beatles) that has put as much thought into their songwriting. So all that thought and effort went over your head? Well, thanks for pointing that out to me. Now, I know not to even ask you for directions. You are probably an idiot. This band has grown from an alt-metal stand-out from the early nineties into one of the best rock bands ever. I saw Tool twice during this tour and was blown away by how much emphasis they put on the music. Everyone always puts so much stress on Maynard's wardrobe, which is such a distraction from what they try to put out for their real fans. Basically, you people who don't like Tool have no opinions to offer me. I went on a date with a girl who didn't like the Simpsons once. I equate you people with her. Off of my radar... <br />
B00007EL92|4.0|The disc sounds great; I have no complaint about that. In fact, the technicians who are responsible for the digital remastering of the Presley catalogue are to be commended and congratulated. To hear the James Burton-like lead guitar solo on \\"Devil in Disguise\\" bouncing out of one's speakers with such vivid sound... no, PRESENCE... is a sonic miracle.    I've graded this disc one star down from perfection for the simple reason that there are several #1 songs on the follow-up, 2ND TO NONE, which I prefer to some on this disc (does anyone truly prefer \\"The Wonder of You\\" to \\"If I Can Dream\\"?), so the track listing seems to me just short of ideal.    Never mind that; my biggest concern and reservations about this release concern the DVD Audio edition of this release. Is this, in fact, a DVD Audio release? I know it claims to be, and that's how my player identifies it when it loads up, but everything else about it suggests it's a Super Audio CD.    I own a Pioneer multiregion DVD/CD player that plays Super Audio CDs as well as DVD Audio discs. I own a number of discs in both formats and am familiar with the ways in which they differ. This Elvis disc (at least my copy) doesn't seem to be DVD Audio for several reasons. First of all, all my other DVD Audio discs offer some sort of still video image as they play, changing images from song to song, and sometimes offering lyrics; also, when you select \\"Menu,\\" DVD Audio discs give you an onscreen menu to make your track-to-track toggling more convenient. My \\"DVD Audio\\" Elvis disc doesn't have any of this, and the absence of an onscreen menu makes accessing the bonus tracks darn near impossible. (I've owned this disc for months, but just figured out how to find these bonus tracks tonight -- by double pressing my player's menu button. I was beginning to think they weren't really there!) Also, when I load this disc, my player is initially confused by it; it doesn't identify the disc and allow me to press Play as it does with allmy others -- it pauses, then proceeds directly into Play mode on its own. Only when I press Stop does the disc identify itself as DVD Audio.    But the really strange thing is that my amplifier reads the incoming signal from the disc as ANALOG, which is correct for SACD but not for DVD Audio. I have double- and triple-checked my player and amp settings and everything is as it should be. So did RCA goof up in mastering this disc and not tell anyone? (It wouldn't be the first time, if you remember the first CD pressing of Jefferson Starship's EARTH.)     These discoveries may help to explain the earlier review from the person who couldn't get the disc to play. It's not a digital pressing: it's analog and thus won't play in players that don't allow analog resettings. Not a single review of this disc has mentioned this, perhaps because DVD Audio/SACD are fairly new formats still unfamiliar to many reviewers.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I didn't start out tonight to write a review, but now that I am , here goes.  <br />    This Album is the heart of the new U2 era of 2002-2012. The first being their first four albums 1. Boy 2. October 3. War and the live EP 4. Under a Blood Red Sky. The second era begins with 5. The Unforgetable Fire 6. Wide Awake in America 7. The Joshua Tree 8. Rattle and hum . The third era was the ninties with 9. Achtung Baby 10. Zooropa 11. Passengers and 12. Pop The fourth and most recent era began with 13. All That You Can't Leave Behind and now reaches it's middle with 14. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.With a four album per era pattern devined from this listing we can see that we have one more \\"major\\" U2 album and one live or \\"side\\" album in store for us over the next 6 years, not to mention the third installment of the Best of... series(1980-1990, 1991-2001, 2002-2012) Yielding 19 Official U2 releases, with probably a Coda or wrap up Album by 2012, bringing the final U2 album count to 20 over 33 years. With this in mind we can see that the most important Albums of each era have been , 1st-War, 2nd-The Joshua Tree, 3rd-Achtung Baby, and by all rights standards and measurements so far it's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb for the Fourth (and final)U2 era. Hence since all of these other Three Albums are 5 star albums I'm giving this one a Five because it easily holds up next to these other Three. But who knows , the next one could even be better, considering all of the elements over the next 6 years . And I predict their \\"Final\\" album will be their best ever, with all the lessons learned and earned over the past 33 years. But for Now the top Dog is How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, so 5 stars, easy
B000002H33|5.0|Well here we go again.  In 1984, it was Ride The Lightning.  Now in 1986 it's Master of puppets.  It's impossible to say which CD is better therefore if your new to Metallica....get them both. Here's my review of Master of Puppets.<br />1. Battery 10/10. One of the greatest opening songs for any album in rock history. Spanish guitar intro and then the thrash comes in.<BR>2. Master of Puppets 10/10. INCREDIBLE! Name another band that can manage to keep you entertained for 8 and a half minutes. One of Hammet's best solos in the middle.<BR>3. The Thing That Should Not Be 10/10. Very slow for Metallica standards. Very heavy for Metallica standards. Kickass<BR>4. Sanitarium 11/10. Best song on the album. hetfield's vocals are so deep and perfect and the song ends with a blistering solo.<BR>5. Disposable Heroes 10/10. Another 8 minute epic. one of the greatest Metallica chorouses ever. BACK IN THE FRONT!<BR>6. leper Messiah 9/10. Not as bad as Escape on RTL but definitely the weakest on this track. Good though.<BR>7. Orion 10/10. THE Metallica instrumental. Perfection and better than Ktulu.<BR>8. Damage, Inc. 10/10. Great way to end the album. Only song with lousy vocals but heavy.<br />Metallica are the second greatest rock band ever behind only Lep Zepplin. As another reviewer said, Black sabbath invented metal but METALlica perfected it.
B00068IOWM|4.0|What a joke. Let me break down these reviewers. They are either people who hate the band and will never like any of their material, people who hate u2 and haven't even heard the album, or are u2 fans who aren't happy with the new direction.  If it's the last one, then it's insulting to give it only 1 star.  Outrageous!! This is not u2's best album, its very good but does not touch the UNFORGETTABLE FIRE or JOSHUA TREE.  Still, it is better than 97% of the other music that's out in the world today.  So I'm happy about the new u2 release, everyone relax.
1582432678|3.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is an unusual novel; I can't remember the last time I read a novel that is so completely nihilistic. To me the promise of the book was the possibility of discovering a uniquely powerful perspective that could transform an unlikeable protagonist into someone sympathetic.  I was disappointed, however, that Lionel Shriver's portrayal of a sadistic child was only that.   Once Kevin's story is completely revealed, the stark ending of the book fails to offer anything hopeful or remotely redemptive.  Shriver plays with the possibility that an unloving mother may be to blame, but she never makes a conclusive cause-and-effect link.  Dad's a brainless nincompoop, and Eva, the shadowy mother, never seems to be all there.  Always reacting to Kevin's behavior, Eva never does anything proactive, like bringing Kevin to a pyschiatrist.  When she lets her six year old son hold a secret over her head, she acts unbelievably weak-willed.  It certainly seems that Shriver did extensive research into violent teens, yet I wonder if the same amount of research was invested in Eva's character.  Ultimately, I'm not sure whether Shriver wants us to contemplate the psyche of a child like Kevin or the pysche of a parent who is at a complete loss when it comes to parenting.
6305537321|4.0|Premiere Magazine just named Mickey Rooney's over-the-top impersonation of the pompous and sexually obsessed Japanese neighbor upstairs as one of the fifty most offensive things in movie history. I don't disagree, and as a Japanese-American myself, I have to admit I find Rooney's Asian make-up a bit much. But it's hard to take his sideshow character too seriously, as his casting is consistent with the loopiness of this film. This 1961 film classic must have been considered quite daring in its day, but as with most such attempts, it feels dated in certain ways, as director Blake Edwards tries awfully hard to capture the upscale bohemian atmosphere of early sixties New York. The party scene, for example, plays on a bit too long, I suppose to show how decadent those creative types truly can be.<br /><br />At the time, Audrey Hepburn was at a crossroads in her career having spent most of the fifties playing innocent, dewy-eyed ingenues, so the role of self-proclaimed hedonist Holly Golightly (aptly named but hardly a \\"no-name slob\\" as she puts it) must have had great appeal. After all, Truman Capote, the author from whose novella this movie is based, wanted to cast Marilyn Monroe. But it is hard to imagine how Edwards could have pulled this off without the inimitable Hepburn, a sheer delight as she dances quite flagrantly around the fact that her character is a high-priced call girl by exhibiting her trademark sense of style, fun and vulnerability. Holly's fear of commitment is the crux of this story, even though she is hopelessly drawn to failed writer Paul Varjak, \\"Fred\\" to Holly, played by George Peppard. A kindred spirit whose feelings for her are more than mutual, his character is not above taking a few dollars himself, as well as a Baroque monstrosity of an apartment, from a wealthy, married interior decorator played with conniving sophistication by the always wonderful Patricia Neal. I still think Peppard is the weak link here as he doesn't have the requisite light touch to keep up with Holly's shenanigans, although he does well in capturing the pained look of a novelist with semi-permanent writer's block.<br /><br />The rest of the cast can be best described as eccentric, in particular, Buddy Ebsen (pre-Jed Clampett) as Holly's backwoods first husband, Martin Balsam as her fast-talking agent (for her apocryphally explained acting career) and of course Rooney, whose accent is actually surprisingly accurate if you can get past the make-up. Designer Givenchy is also at work here, and here you'll see the debut of the classic black cocktail dress that launched a million copies to this day. Henry Mancini's romantic music provides the perfect accompaniment, and Hepburn's plaintive, ukelele-strummed version of \\"Moon River\\" is still the most definitive. The film does end on the most romantic of notes with a rain-soaked kiss in the alley, just about as lovely a scene as you are likely to see in movies. Sadly there are no extras on this DVD other than the trailer.to keep up with Holly's shenanigans, although he does well in capturing the pained look of a novelist with semi-permanent writer's block.

B0002XNSY0|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is an unqualified masterpiece.  Like all great satire, it is at once hilarious and horrifying.  A scathing indictment of the absurdity of the cold war and of modern warfare, Dr. Strangelove is still very relevent today.    The film presents a quite plausible scenario in which government beaurocracy breaks down and the fate of the world is left in the hands of the mad and the blood-thirsty.  The script is comic genius, as are the performances of Slim Pickens, Sterling Haden, George C. Scott, and partcularly, Peter Sellers who gives the performances of his career.  That's right, performances - three of them, each amazing in its own right.     For fans of black comedy, they don't get any better than this.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|In \\".L.A. Confidential\\", Russell Crowe was the cop with  the dark and tragic past who found love in an unlikely place. In his Oscar-winning turn in \\"Gladiator\\" he showed us that man cannot live by bread and circuses alone. In \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", he takes the audience on a bizarre journey between genius and madness, and now, in this seafaring epic to which Peter Weir gives a surprisingly lighthanded direction, based on the novels  by Patrick O'Brian, Crowe lends his formidable stance to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey as he leads the crew of HMS Surprise in a campaign against the French ship Acheron in 1805.   As the story commences, we view the British ship on the glistening waters off the coast of Brazil. The pre-dawn calm is shattered by the sound of the Acheron's cannonfire.   Soon, the audience bears witness to the poignancy of lost innocence, graphic surgeries at sea, and the general claustrophobic conditions of a battleship in the early 19th century. A viewer can almost smell the stench, taste the awful food, and feel directly in the presence of both the lesser and greater of two weevils.   The monotony is broken up with singing by the crew members, upperclassmen as well as underlings, and occassionally the elegant sound of Aubrey's violin as it mingles with the cello played by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (a role in which Crowe is reunited with  his 'Beautiful Mind' co-star, Paul Bettany)on a duet or two. As Aubrey's friend, the more analytical  Maturin provides a stablizing influence on the Captain.   The camaraderie among the men deepens during Aubrey's dinnertime anecdotes, and outrageously bad puns as he loosens up a little while slightly inebriated.   But the astute captain is firm and consistant in running his ship.  The film drives home the point that the young boys who served (personified by the angelic Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney) were not coddled because of their tender ages, and were made to grow up quickly in an era that had less respect for childhood.   Viewers follow the crew through tragedies caused by natural or man-made disasters, and they also receive psychological  profiles of men who are forced to serve in such confining conditions.   Aubrey often faces some wrenching dilemmas, but after many years at sea, never wavers in his certainty of whatever course of action he chooses. He spends a good bit of onscreen time  bestriding the deck with eyes that narrow and a perfect Cupid's bow mouth twisting into a scowl of determination during battle. A lot of the drama that cannot be expressed in words is expressed in close-ups  of Crowe's gracefully oval-shaped visage. When speaking in a jesting or slightly jesting manner, his large, deep-set  eyes-- which can never decide between emerald and opalescence--widen, and grow round as if he were daft.But he is mostly staid and stoic although we do see his delight in his work as he climbs up to and down from the highest heights of his ship to be rewarded with a more panoramic view of the ocean with upperclassman James D'Arcy at his side.   Occassionally the men serving under him share his delight, and are relieved from months of confinement at sea when they weigh anchor in the Galapagos Islands where Dr. Maturin does his naturalist research and the crew play cricket as a respite from their duties. There is a sense of gentleness and serenity  brought on by the  beautiful Oscar winning-cinematography of the curious seals, tortoises, and other creatures as they receive a rare visit from humans. In a few brief moments the maimed Lord Blakeley has a chance to be a child as he roams about joyously in loose clothing as an assistant to the recently injured Maturin.   Soon enough the pursuit of the Acheron is resumed. But the trip to the Galapagos results in Aubrey's gaining insight on how to lure and overtake the enemy ship. Strangely, the film's battle scenes didn't strike me as too intense, and while this film has its inevitably  dark and brooding moments, the lighter moments compliment and compensate for them quite nicely. There is a very stirring moment when Aubrey finally  views the corpse of his mortal enemy. Perhaps he feels some satisfaction...But how young and handsome his rival looks even in death. One wonders what his story was and how hard Aubrey had to try to suppress any feeling of common humanity as he accepted the French Captain's sword in surrender.   Suppression of any such feelings may not have been too difficult when we see the high price of victory, laid out in sewn-up hammocks on the deck of the British ship...Men and boys of all ages in whom we've invested a few hour's time...The loss of sage advice of the elderly seamen, and the permanently halted ambition of the young men are dramatically emphasized as we view them lined up, pale and still, awaiting their final journey...   But soon life aboard HMS Surprise resumes its normalcy, and when a piece of misinformation is revealed to Aubrey the merry pursuit of duty continues and as the crew go to quarters, we are left with a stringed duet to remember them by.
B00005AFMT|5.0|Their best CD. Adrian and Robert were the first (that I can think of ) to approach the guitar synthesizer as a serious intrument. The music sounds so polished and wreckless. This is one of the most important albums in rock music. Period.
0380002930|5.0|I read Watership Down for the first time when I was 13.  Now 10 years later it still holds the same magic. This is a truly wonderful book.  Many other reviewers mention the heavy symbolism used by Adams to represent various forms of government.  I never read it that way.  To me it was just a grand adventure.  But then in my opinion, books like these are truly the best.  Each and every time one reads them, something new can be discovered.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Kurosawa's \\"Kagemusha\\" is a complicated film, and sometimes difficult to like.  Kurosawa's preference for long shots and medium shots over closeups, very little cutting in dialogue scenes, and long pauses make for a slow, deliberate pace.  It often feels like we're watching bits of story happening in real time; this applies to the battles as well.  But these are not deficiencies.  The pace (similar to the later \\"Ran\\") gives the film an almost meditative quality that you might not expect given the war setting.  \\"Seven Samurai\\" it certainly is not, but it is well worth the effort. <br /> <br />This film contains what is, to me, one of the single most beautiful images I've seen in film.  At sunset, two solders of the Takeda clan are discussing whether Shingen has been killed.  The image is only in silhouette against a blazingly orange-red sky, with the air full of dust as a long procession of soldiers and cavalry slowly marches by.  Beautiful. <br /> <br />The Criterion edition of this film is Kurosawa's original full-length version, not the shorter international version previously available on VHS and laserdisc in the USA.  I'm eagerly waiting to see the longer version, which I'm told restores a small role played by Takashi Shimura (one of my favorite of Kurosawa's regular actors) previously excised from the international version. <br /> <br />
0156027321|2.0|It is a well written book with a interesting storyline and potentially a great literature. When reading, please remember it is all fictional, facts mentioned towards nature and animals can be fictional too. I know for a fact that some of the scientific findings that Mr. Martel shared holds no grounds. That is probably why the greatest fictional writers always gone to extent and make sure facts were correct before even starting to write a book. <br /> <br />In all, a good book for lesisure reading when waiting for a bus and I would prefer to read books by writers that are purist in their artistry.

Sometimes it's spine-tinglingly creepy (but only if you listen to it on rare occassion(s)) and sometimes it's a little bit experiemental sounding.

I can only assume it is consistent with the quality of writing you'll find throughout since I couldn't make it past the first two hundred or so pages.  Martin wields his pen like a sledgehammer.<br /><br />Also, if descriptive sex between Genghis Khan and his thirteen-year-old bride makes you a little uncomfortable you may want to consider something else.  I accept the reality of child brides in this setting, but couldn't Martin have just alluded to the fact that the marriage was consummated and the groom was surprisingly gentle?
0790729652|2.0|Like any child who grew up watching Adam West's Batman, I was instantly disappointed with Tim Burton's vision for the character.  For me, Batman represents that shining beacon of hope to the hopeless, and he always seems concerned for the safety of others.  At least, he used to.  Sadly, it seems that Batman is gone, along with Robin, the Batboat, the Batpoles, the Batcopter, and classic villains like Egghead and Louie the Lilac.<br /><br />In their place, we get a Batman who relies on gadgets more than brains, a Joker who hardly ever laughs, and fight scenes without the trademark \\"Pow\\"s and \\"Zap\\"s.  It may have a decent story, but I'll always look at this big-budget bust as a missed opportunity.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I saw this movie about 4 years ago and I loved its music. These tracks are all hand-picked to offer the maximum feeling for the movie. They just make you want to get up and dance. The best two songs on this album in my opinion are \\"The Time of My Life\\" and \\"Hungry Eyes\\", both being huge hits in America a long time ago. They're great driving songs and soon you'll find yourself singing along or tapping at least a finger to Merry Clayton's \\"Yes\\" or thinking of your loved one when hearing Swaize's \\"She's Like the Wind\\". Classics remain classics and this CD brings 12 high quality true pop songs.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Im giving it 5 stars based on the music, not on her or her personal life. This is one of the best pop albums I've heard. It was not as big of a commercial hit as her previous albums, but this one is filler free. Every song is good. Some standout tracks for me are Brave New Girl, Everytime, Breathe on Me, Ealry Mornin and of course Toxic. The fact that Britney co-wrote most of the tracks makes it even better. I bought this the week it came out and still listen to it regularly.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Much of American animation, although good, is made for an audience with ADHD.  Miyazaki has the courage, and talent, to take his time telling a story, without trying to \\"wow\\" you every second of the film. <br /> <br />This movie has a subtle grace, beauty, and charm which is truly moving.  This is a rare find in any medium.  Think e.e. cummings, or The Mona Lisa, or snow falling past a street light, and you'll get the idea.  This first time I saw this movie, I didn't immediately realize how much it affected me, but it stayed with me for days.  I've seen it several times, and never grow tired of it.  It's about time it became available in the US.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This is a great find, since if you like old-school Rock...or classic Rock...you won't have to be stuck listening to garbage like Mannheim Steamroller all throughout the \\"yule\\". <br />Cindi Lauper did a cool X-Mas album as did Leon Redbone. <br />As for terminoligy. <br />I think it's still fine to call a CD an album or even record ... since all a CD is is a format ... but when I say \\"record\\" ... I'm thinking ...\\"this is a record of a recording session\\" ... and album is fine as well ... since a compilation of songs is an \\"album\\" of songs - very similar to a photo album. <br />ciao

He was sooo egotistic and selfish. Yea he did still love Pocahontas but compared to John Rolfe, Rolfe seemed so much more better then Smith. Rolfe seemed to care a little more about Pocahontas and knows her much more then Smith did.
B00062IDCO|3.0|While the last season was not great, it was an improvement, though the Chakotay/Seven of Nine love story was lame and really came from no where. Here was another stumbling block of the series. One has to wonder just how big Hirogen space is, because they bump into the again in the two-part Flesh and Blood (as the consequences of Janeway giving them the holodeck technology bites her in the ass). Like the Malon, who a made several appearances in the fifth season and were told their space is small (yet late in the season by the time Juggernaut aired, Voyager has jumped ten years closer to the Alpha Quadrant after the events of Dark Frontier), the return of the Hirogens is a head scratchier. True, we are told early on that the Hirogen have no real homeworld and they travel the comos, spread out like dandelions, but the odds of running into them -10,000 light years closer to Earth -was not realistic. I mean there was no way they could've run into the same Hirogen they gave the holodeck technology to in the first place. It just seemed they had this concept -Hologram Rights - so they hoped no one paid attention.  And while Shattered was a clip show, with out the actual clips unlike Relativity, it was another example of how desperate the show had become. As the series began to wind down, it began to tie up loose ends, as all but one of the Borgs kids were finally shuffled off. And while a Q episode is always worth waiting for, Q2 was a sorry story, as it looked like John de Lancie was tired of playing the role. And only God knows how he was able to get his own real life son, Keegan to play Q's son. But as the stories dried up, the show reverted back to predictable episodes. As an example, while it nice to finally get rid of the ever-annoying Neelix, his send off Homestead was very hackneyed. And then there was the Doctor's directionless holonovel thing. Desperation can breed bad stories, and Voyager seems to swim in its ocean. And while I had given up on the show way back in season 2, I had some dark hope the show would find its feet, but. Alas, it was not going to happen. The series ended with a remake of a previous episode, but is also probably Mulgrew's finest performance, at least as the silver-haired Admiral. Endgame opened 10 years after the crew of Voyager returned after spending 23 years in the Delta Quadrant. But all was not rosy, and an older, more cynical Admiral Janeway has decided to alter the outcome of what has happened. Like Timeless from the series fifth season, Janeway (like Harry was), is filled with regret at what has happened to her crew, especially Seven of Nine and Chakotay, who appeared to have died returning home. So she decides to change the rules and her future. Very politically incorrect and very \\"cowboy diplomacy\\" like. When all is said and done Endgame was a fine finale, if once again, unoriginal. There were some nice touches in this show, including Alice Krige's return as the Borg Queen and Kate Mulgrew's finest appearance as the older, bitter Janeway. Had she played Janeway like this through 7 seasons, I think the show could have been better. And while the ending was abrupt, it was in keeping with Trek's entire problem of rushing all its endings. Looking at the series as a whole, Michael Piller was able to see both its strengths and weaknesses. \\"The whole idea of exploring space is a metaphor for exploring ourselves,\\" he said. \\"When Voyager did that, I think it did very well. I think the Seven of Nine stories gave us some insight into humanity and the meaning of humanity that the series sorely wanted. It had its moments. But when it did the exploding spaceships and space-monsters and so forth, the problem is that that's what everybody does in science fiction. I think that reduces Star Trek to being no better and worse than other science fiction shows.\\" Piller told Cinefantastique's Anna L. Kaplan (via TrekWeb). \\"I have always encouraged the writers to try to find the human elements, the moral and ethical dilemmas,\\" he said. \\"I think there was less an appetite for that after I left.\\" Ultimately, Voyager lacked a distinctive voice; a style to call it's own. TOS featured a likable cast and featured parables. TNG went a step further with their stories, and made the crew more human, as character development and story arc's made the show more realistic. DS9 took a little of TNG's soap opera elements and took it in another direction, featuring a near series long arc that told the viewers nothing was as it seemed. Voyager attempted to take all those elements from the three previous series -and it worked only on occasion- but nothing else was added to the mix. There was no growth and change as the series aged because it had its Temporal Reset Button pushed week after week. And because of that, the show became fated to be a somewhat entertaining Star Trek series, but at the end of the day, offered nothing in the way of the next step in this franchise's evolutionary life.

B000002G7E|5.0|White Light White Heat is one of the greatest musical expeiments of the 1960's after getting rid of Wharol and Nico The Velvets made one of the most vicious and noisest albums ever.  By noisest i mean loud and by loud i mean pure sonic terror and by that i mean fantastic. <br /> <br /> <br />White Light White Heat starts of with just that wich i consider the first punk song written with the opening shout of \\"White Light\\" a great song and decieves the listener in the begining.  The Gift a story about love infedelity and the mail. Spoken by John Cale played with total distortion.  Lady Godiva's Operation a very experimental song turns out great with Cale and Reed singing and the whole band making operation room noises and if u listen carefully somebody is whispering subliminal messages.  Here she comes now is the cool down before the finale a good song and is fitted perfectly in the album.  I heard her call my name is loud brash vicoius and has better then hendrix guitar solo's in it and if you don't belive me get this album.  Sister Ray the climax of the album is just a great jam session recorded in ONE TAKE pretty unbeliveable come to thunk about it.  Their are shadows of all the songs in Sister Ray especially I heard her call my name. This 17 minute trip is the best song on the album and possibly of the John Cale era of the velvets.   <br /> <br />Pure sonic terror with distorted instruments and poetic lyrics sounds the doors huh?

I looked at the book again (for the first time in about 10 years or so) after seeing the movie, and was surprised to see that all the scenes in the book were close to the movie.  Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and I enjoyed all of his performances in this.  I also thought the appearance of a little elf named Steven Tyler was hilarious!
6305358567|1.0|This film is the most ludicrous, incoherent garbage! It would be comical if it weren't so irritating. I kept asking myself as stupidity piled on stupidity -- WHAT were these writers SMOKING? <br /> <br />Too many complaints to mention, but I will say if Elizabeth had been this wobbly and retarded, she wouldn't have lasted long enough to inherit the throne, let alone keep it! <br /> <br />If you want to see a dramatized version of Elizabeth's life, stick with \\"Elizabeth R\\", made for British TV with Glenda Jackson. Yes, the sets may be tatty, but you won't notice because the writing and acting are so good, and history hasn't been twisted into a perverted pretzel in order to tell the story.
B000002H97|3.0|Although this has widely been hailed as one of the great albums of all time, it is clear to any metallica fan that this was simply the beginning of the end for what was the greatest band in metal.  It has a few good songs, Enter Sandman is a classic, and Nothing Else Matters is a good ballad, although not as good as RTLs Fade to Black or AJFAs One.  However it is far less metal than their first 4 albums andmore commercial.  It begins the breakdown of their lyrical and musical compexity that would countinue in Load and Reload until they hit rock bottom w/ their latest recording which will go nameless.  The older albums, apart from being heavier, had more insightful lyrics, songs such as One, Fade to Black, and Sanitarium, which sing about war, suicide, and insanity.  As opposed to the Black Album, which sings about being a werewolf (Of Wolf and Man) Ooh!  Now I'm impressed!  The songs are shorter and more radio friendly, which  doesn't give them time to expand with their musical brilliance. All in all, it's a good hard rock album, but a bad Metallica album, and an omen of what they were soon to become.

Evolution                           This match is very underrated.  It should have left Batista out and have him face somebody else.  Evolution wins when Orton hit an RKO on Foley. 8/10    Sable & Torrie Wilson v. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie        [...] Evining Gown Match         This match was full of just catfights but that's not gonna get it a good rating.  Sable & Torrie win. 4/10    Chavo Guerrero v. Jaime Noble v. Funaki v. Ultimo Dragon v. Rey Mysterio v. Nunzio v. Tajiri v. Shannon Moore v. Billy Kidman            Cruiserweight Title            This match was way to fast but it had great action.  Funaki gets eliminated it 3 seconds.  Chavo retains his title. 7/10    Goldberg v. Brock Lesnar            SPR=Stone Cold Steve Austin            This was a very good match, people complain their stare down too much but when they go at it it is great.  Goldberg wins and Austin stunners both of them. 9/10    Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi v. APA v. Basham Brothers v. World's Greatest Tag Team         WWE Tag Titles                  This match was better then the Raw tag match.  The ending is horrible but the work is so much better.  Scotty & Rikishi retain. 7/10    Victoria v. Molly HollyWomen's Title            This was a bad match but it gets a high rating because of when Molly gets her head shaved.  Victoria retains. 8/10    Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle               WWE Title                  This was a good match but not as good a match that they will have at Summerslam.  Eddie retains in a okay match with a funny ending. 8/10    Undertaker v. Kane              This match was bad and it was dominated by Taker.  I love his entrance and I thought the whole thing was a set-up by Kane. 4/10    Shawn Michaels v. Triple H v. Chris Benoit          World Title                  This match is way overrated.  I hated it.  You knew Benoit was gonna win and you knew he was gonna make HHH tap to win.  Benoit wins the title. 6/10      This WrestleMania scored a 59.  It was a decent PPV.
B00005JN4O|5.0|OK, so I may be a fan of both Johnny Depp & Kate Winslett but I'm not always a fan of their films.  Still, one doesn't have to be a fan to like, or even love, this movie -- it stands on its own magical merits.  Perhaps Tinkerbell scattered some fairy dust on Finding Neverland because it's absolutely one of the best films of 2004 and it should certainly give Depp another Oscar nom, and maybe garner a few more for Best Film, Director, Costumes, Art Direction and Set Design as well.  The movie's blend of the real world (the England of J.M Barrie) and the scenes of magical imagination are flawlessly intertwined and filled with both the innocent delight of children and the bittersweet realities of adults.  The performances are uniformly terrific: Kate Winslett shines and Johnny Depp delivers a superbly shaded, low-key performance with a great Scottish accent (although I'm certainly no expert).  Not really a children's film although older ones may enjoy it and adults can't help but be enchanted.  If only more films like this could be made to balance out the numerous overly-loud, explosive, high-concept/low-brained films that flood the multiplexes...but there probably isn't enough fairy dust in the universe to make that happen.  Fly to Finding Neverland and give yourself an early holiday treat.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I walked in with high expectations, I left wondering, is there any movie more stupid than this? The main problem is so out there that the most naive person on earth wouldn't be caught into thinking, could this actually happen? Ok, it starts out with a team of explorers in the Arctic when a giant crack opens in the ice. Is the explorer dead? No! At the last minute, with what? 50 pounds of equipment on his back, he performs a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-style jump across 10 feet of empty air and saves himself. Then the scene goes to a labratory and it shows that the earth will be frozen in a few days in a totally. So, because of global warming, giant expensive-special-effects waves come into New York and people run into a library which, for whatver reason, is filled with food and blankets. Then, voila, everything's frozen! So, the terrible actor's character's father says he'll rescue him from the library. We all know how boring the library is! He succeeds thanks to the main character using a pay phone underwater! So, in conclusion, this is a really stupid movie. A reviewer said this is good because its realistic, unlike Independence Day. I'd have to say  this is as unrealistic as Independence Day. No person,e ven a little kid, would see this movie and think, could the world freeze with giant tornadoes and hurricanes any day? Also, this movie is boring. We all saw previews and craved it until it came out. But, lots of the movie is set in that stupid library. (What's with the wolves! That is one of the lamest scenes I've ever seen in a movie period.) Even the disaster scenes could be more interesting. We saw the best parts in previews! So, in concluision, if I was to give this a report card, it would be: <br /> <br />GRAPHICS:A <br />STORY:D+ <br />ACTING:D+ <br />CHARACTERS:D <br />WATCHABILITY:C <br />LOGIC:F <br /> <br />PS. Why 2 stars instead of one? The special effects are beautiful. Also, sorry; this review does ramble.

B0000027I6|5.0|I am a student of mass communication, and no one has ever musically expressed the darker side of our media abundant culture than Roger Waters.  The fact that we are bombarded day in and day out with millions of media messages, most of which occur in our own homes around the television, did not slip past Mr. Waters in this accurate look at the negative effects of media exposure.  This is closely related to Neil Postman's book \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death.\\"  Television has radically changed our culture... for better or worse.  \\"Amused to Death\\" is a healthy reflection on that change.
B00003CXCT|2.0|What a let down!! <br /> <br />I was born on the same year that Star Wars came out, albeit a few months earlier, and by the time I was old enough to go to the theatres, they banned new American movies to be distributed in India (only Soviet movies were authorised to be shown and most English movie theatres either closed down or resorted to showing Hindi or vernacular films or cheap Hong Kong flicks for the major part of 80's).  <br /> <br />The very first brush with this legacy happened in the summer '91 when I watched Return Of Jedi at the theatre as a 14 yr old, although don't remember much of it except for the chase scene. <br /> <br />So essentially, I was initiated into the Star Wars galaxy in circa 1997 when the Special Editions came out on Video and were shown in theatres as well; the Archie Goodwin comic strip came out for a brief period in a local magazine during my early years, and fascinating as they were, could not quite the follow the story having not been initiated to the Star Wars legacy yet. <br /> <br />That finally brings to these recent pressings of the trilogy and the supposed improvements. Before really proceeding any further, Mr. Lucas should really answer some questions that come to mind: <br /> <br />*Why amend the text of the tractor beam marker (that Obi-Wan turns off in Darth Vader's lair) in the New Hope? <br />*Why blank out Luke's scream in the Empire Strikes Back, while he admittedly attempts the jump on his own accord, the sheer drop would scare the daylights out of any human; so the scream was justified! <br />*The most blatant of all, why substitute Anakin Skywalker's spirit image with a younger version? <br /> <br />Lucas should realise the fact that these are movies that should be watched just on their merits and not for some supposed continuity with subsequent editions. If this is made the norm, we would have umpteen editions of a hit-movie till the maker kicks the basket. The bottomline is give the viewers what they had liked instead of a tinkered version that you would hope they would like! <br /> <br />Well, what's the point now; what's done is done and the fact that my hard-earned money has gone down the drain wouldn't make me particularly happy with this purchase. <br /> <br />Lucasbaby could go on making as many version as he wants to but he would not get any more of my dough! <br />
B000002AH9|5.0|As a youth, I discovered the brilliance of various interpreters of song, specifically those labeled 'jazz singers'. There were five ladies that captivated me. Ella. Sarah. Dinah Washington. Carmen McRae, and Lady Day. Each different. Each unique. Each brilliant. <br /> <br />None of them touched my soul as much as Billie, and no album had as much of an effect on me as LADY IN SATIN. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />It is also controversial. <br /> <br />Billie's voice is weaker than it was on the masterful Verve sessions earlier that decade. She is also backed by Ray Ellis & His Orchestra instead of a traditional jazz group. <br /> <br />But Billie wanted to work with Ellis, and the two of them melded amidst the then-new stereophonic recording technology to create a masterpiece. <br /> <br />If Billie's vocal instrument is lacking, the phrasing and truth are undeniable, and underscoring it are Ellis' sublime arrangements. This is perfection. <br /> <br />As CS-8048, this Columbia LP never went out of print. It remained a stalwart in the label's catalog. It has been lovingly restored and remastered for CD. Along with her early Verve work, this is the true Billie Holiday. Now and forever. God rest her soul. She was the greatest of them all.

068987474X|2.0|If you're looking for a book to solve all of your relationship problems, then your problem isn't your relationships.  The problem is how you're going about solving your relationship problems.   <br /> <br />     That said, this book is highly entertaining but lacks useful content.  Everything that Greg says is leading up to his catch phrase.  I don't think he even considered other circumstances in each case.  I think he just took some of the more salacious situations, and quickly wrote a variation of \\"move on\\" with some details from the situation thrown in.   <br />     I'm not a die-hard romantic or a bitter cynic.  From an objective woman's point of view, this book is fun if you like to read those advice columns in Cosmo.  I learned two things I didn't know; one was from Liz's anecdotes that she gives at the end of the chapters and the other from one of Greg's unscientific polls that he gives.  I'm taking the advice with a grain of salt, because let's face it-- 1. these people are TV writers, and 2. they have no idea what we're like and they're blindly dishing up advice.   <br />     Because this wasn't the life changing book that it was hyped up to be, (and oh how it be hyped up) you're better off checking it out from a library or borrowing it from a friend or co-worker.  Or even better, ask a close guy friend or brother those important guy questions you have.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The Amazon review is the usual nonsense coming from media critics, and the hardcore (dumb OLD boys) of the Nashville power base, who can't stomach anything that doesn't follow the status quo or is viewed as modern music. <br /> <br />The critter-sizers call Shania's music bubble gummy, but most other top country artist's have lyrics that make Shania's seem like a Mozart concert masterpiece. <br /> <br />Songs on this CD like \\"From This Moment On\\", \\"Forever And For Always\\", will live forever... moocho longer than the nonartistic critics who will die young from jealousy and hate. <br /> <br />Shania has saved Nashville's butt! Before Shania arrived country music sales were declining. With Shania's entrance on the country/pop stage, it has brought country music to the WORLD, not just down South in the US of A. <br /> <br />Shania has sold more CD's than any other country music singer, period. end of story. Shania is to country music today, what a young Elvis was to rock & roll yesterday. It's interesting that Elvis had to put up with the same crap from his critics when he arrived on stage. <br /> <br />Critics are worse than funeral directors cause they try to embalm their \\"dead\\" while the \\"corpse\\" is still breathing or singing!

B00005JKZV|5.0|Some recent great personal reviews now that we've had some time since the theatrical release and ROTK. It seems the lasting legacy is more readily apparent now that we have more mature reviews than the early kids' reactions and negative reviews which had more to do with prized Star Wars prequel and Matrix legacies defeated as LOTR emerges as the true film classics of the 21st century alongside great films of the last century such as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", \\"Ben-Hur\\", and \\"Gone with the Wind\\" not to mention the original \\"Star Wars\\" before it was transmorgified into \\"Episode IV: ANH\\" in 1979, special edition 1997, and Hayden Christensen prequel edition 2004. Let me add to these insightful reviews my humble thoughts about TTT. Of course TTT theatrical or widescreen is the weakest of the trilogy. Jackson, Walsh and particulary Bowens tried to \\"fix\\" the most boring middle part of the book trilogy by catering to modern Hollywood conventions and possibly NL studio pressures to make the sequel as profitable if not more than the first film. Those changes apart from the original story did not make the movie fail but it spelled out TTT as most inconsistent and superfluous of the trilogy. However, TTT succeeds in great part to the outstanding production in most all aspects which supported all threee films and boasts some of the best action battle scenes(however unreleastic and making Aragorn look too Errol Fylnn with a clumsy attempt at a fix by the \\"cliffdropping\\" scene which is mostly due to Boyens' revisionist plotting attempts imo) , dramatic character acting scenes, and grandiose visual scenes in our new century of film. Jackson is the new Cecille B. DeMille of our time.

0618526412|1.0|I tried reading this book after hearing about all the hoopla on Oprah and was dissapointed. The book started out very interesting when it discussed the two mutes who were roommates and friends and then jumped to several other characters in some sort of boarding house... I stopped half way and moved on to something else. The book is not worth buying but maybe a good one to pick up at the local library...
0780622650|5.0|Of reading those terrible trash reviews of this movie. For alot of us dinosaurs it captured the spirit of the original series in a fun popcorn and coke kinda way, as it should. We didnt watch the series for profund philosophical meanderings like you get in shows like the X-Files. It was 1966, we hadnt yet been to the moon much less Mars and Jupiter so our imagination was allowed free reign to enjoy all the scares and thrills that the Robinsons endured <br />  And for those clueless critics who bash Oldmans Dr Smith for not being as camp as Jonathan Harrises portrayal, try finding the pilot of LIS and you will see that Dr Smith as originally conceived was not humerous at all.  But a cold and treacherous conspirator as Oldman later played him. <br /> <br />Great film, good effects , great story. <br /> <br />No danger here Will Robinson.
0802130208|5.0|\\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\"--Jonathan Swift <br /> <br />     This quote introduces the novel, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", and explains the main character's view of the world. Ignatius J. Reilly is what one might call an indignent butthead. No one is smarter than Ignatius, or so he thinks. Anyone that disagrees with what he has to say or does is a fool. Because Ignatius feels this way, virtually everyone in the world is a fool who can't grasp the level of thinking Ignatius's mind reaches. Ignatius lives a virtual bum's life, shacked up (most of the time, at least) in his bedroom of his mother's house.  He is constantly occupied by the lack of taste and decency in the world that surrounds him.  All the while, he claims to be pursuing a writing career, but only writes scraps and pieces of his daily activities and thoughts.  Ignatius constantly degrades and criticizes everyone he comes in contact with, especially his mother. The novel is a comedic piece of work, and the bulk of the laughter one might get from it comes from the conversations Ignatius engages in with the people he knows or meets; in particular, the letters he and ex-girlfriend, Myrna Minkoff, send to one another are quite hilarious.  <br />     Nevertheless, the novel only works because of Ignatius: the portly, overdramatic, under-sexed character most can't help but love and hate at the same time. The other characters, such as Myrna and Ignatius's mother, are all interesting and funny on their own. But they help to solidify one's disdain for Ignatius, and thus their appreciation for the novel. His arrogance and pretentiousness drive the novel and make it a pleasure to read--if one can handle the abomination that is Ignatius J. Reilly, Your Militant Working Boy.

1577311523|1.0|Oh dear this ain't going to be a popular one but it's still got to be said. Before you purchase this book or begin extolling (excuse the pun)its life changing virtues take a look at the eckharttolle website and associated 'fan' web sites (and the interviews therin) and then decide whether this is a person who has died to his Ego to find the True Self and to whom you want to passionately surrender your 'allegiance' to transcend the 'world of forms'. But maybe i'm missing something as all you 'enthusiasts' are no doubt going to point out. Also do i detect a slight neo-platonic borrowing here and there....Don't get me wrong, I am no cynic, there is a route to that True Self which necessiates transcending the Ego but exuding constant stillness, peace and joy in the face of adversity is not necessarlly a sign of it. It could even be construed as somewhat mentally deranged - far from being 'in touch with reality', actually being 'out of touch' - a sort of 'existenstial anasthesia'. Many of these philosophies of enlightenment use very similar 'jargon' (sorry lanquage). That doesnt mean to say they are all saying the same thing though. Many reviewers talk of the simple and clear lanquage  which Tolle employs to communicate his 'truth'. I am afraid I am not one of them. And for a book espousing a very simple truth it uses a plethora of words in a veritable avalanche of permatations to express it. There is more than a hint of the emperors New Clothes here....  You want simple and clear and eloquent teaching using 'inner journey' concepts, language and phenomology but from a totally different tradition (because inspite of claims to the contrary about not subscribing to any religious tradition a brief acquaintance with his writings shows that he clearly does exactly that), take a peep at the writings and teachings of John Main. Anyway, anybody claiming not to be part of a tradition or to have somehow  'short circuited' other traditions (which he does in respect of the Buddhistway) needs to be treated with the utmost caution. History is full of their relics and tragic legacies. Do not suspend your critical faculties too soon folks and take a long cool look. Its a minefield out there.....in the world of forms.

B000267JQK|4.0|Whether the idea of rereleasing albums and asking your fans to repurchase an album is smart is debatable, but as a standalone album, Seether's Disclaimer II is good - really good. <br />Disclaimer II has just the right balance of heavy rockers with lighter fare with very little fill. The new tracks are all worthy of inclusion, although new fans hooked by the included version of \\"Broken\\" with Amy Lee are going to be a little shell-shocked. <br />Seether is just a solid rock band. They have strong, heavy songs with catchy choruses and melodies throughout.  <br />Sure, lead singer Sean doing his Kurt Cobain impersonation can get a little old, but it doesn't take too much away from the music.  <br />For casual fans who didn't get Disclaimer, Disclaimer II is smart purchase. For fans who felt they were being ripped off, the extra tracks and the DVD (with a rather well-done live show plus the band's videos) make the disc worth the price.
0553573411|2.0|Come hear a tale of characters with marvelous abilities; characters with powers of stealth and strength, the ability to kill and read minds. The powers of suggestion are available to the characters; truly this is a wonderful bunch of heroes. But they are all wimps.<br /><br />This book consists of nothing but one chapter after another of attempts on the lives of the various protagonists. An attempt is made on the life of every good character in the book and all they can do is wring their hands and complain that they cannot take action against the perpetrator. It is infuriating to read.<br /><br />The characters possess wonderful skills that they will not use. And why won't they use them? Who knows? The time is not right, the king didn't command it. The excuses given defy belief.<br /><br />Instead, one is asked to believe that every character in the book will accept these bumbling attempts on the lives of everyone they love, including themselves, without ever taking action. Indeed, the only action that the heroes in the book ever take is after detrimental results have already been suffered.<br /><br />But don't worry, they will whine and complain about what is done to them and those they serve. If fact, the bulk of the book consists of nothing more than an attempt on every good natured character in the book followed by restraint and complaint. This makes for a painfully irritating read. This irritation is only aggravated by how long the book drags on. I don't mind long books, if they are taking me somewhere. Here, the author beats the drum for hundreds of pages without advancing the story anymore that to communicate that the players are exasperated with their circumstances. Of course they are! Their circumstances completely control them.<br /><br />Also, the book's title is terrible. The \\"assassin\\" does not assassinate anyone for almost six hundred pages. The book does merit a rating greater than one star because of its ending, which may free the characters up to act in a manner that is believable, but I wouldn't count on it.<br /><br />This implausibility has been central to both books, and seems to be a part of the author's style. I like the world the she has created. I like the characters, in theory. But the execution is so poor; the players' reaction to the stimulus so unbelievable, that it really detracts from what could be a great book.<br /><br />Hobb, you're going to have to better than this to gain a following from this reader. I have, however, already purchased the third book - I bought all three together - so I will finish the trilogy and report to you here if the series and the author improve.but I wouldn't count on it.

B00067BBQE|2.0|As someone who probably listened to \\"Fallen\\" at least once per day for a year, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Evanescene's new CD/DVD \\"anywhere but home.\\" <br />I have seen Evanescence live and thought they were phenomenal. I have heard other recordings that really captured Evanescence's energy well. <br />This does not. <br />As a positive, \\"Breathe No More\\" is done wonderfully live - but that's about all I really liked on here. <br />First of all, the video of the concert is made for people with ADD. Odd camera angles, ridiculous crowd shots, and flashing imagery are far too distracting and take away from what Evanescence does best: play a show. This does not represent an Evanescence live show at all. <br />Second, the mix isn't terrible, but the drums are tinny. Evanescence was rather heavy live, but not here. <br />Third, the inclusion of Thoughtless is disheartening after hearing them nail \\"Zero\\" by the Smashing Pumpkins. <br />Fourth, \\"My Immortal\\" is tarnished with a crowd sing-a-long, taking away from an otherwise beautiful performance. <br />Fifth, the DVD extras are filler (except the videos, which are much appreciated.) <br />Sixth, \\"Even in Death\\" is not included. <br />Seventh, the \\"new\\" studio track is \\"Missing,\\" a song readily available everywhere (specifically the B-side of the Bring Me to Life single). <br />Eighth, and probably the most infuriating, new guitarist Terry Balsamo changed the guitar solos, which sound out of place and extremely boring. The effort to seemingly remove all references to Ben Moody from the band is ill advised. The songs should be played as they are known from Fallen. Balsamo can give his input into the second record (and quite frankly, if these new solos are any indication of what we're in for, I'm not as excited for the new disc as I was before.) <br />I'm sure most die-hard fans will eat this up. But AS a die-hard fan, I just found it insulting.
B00005AFMT|5.0|Perhaps the coolest intro ever is Tony Levin's stick on \\"Elephant Talk.\\"  Nobody had ever put anything down on tape that sounded like that before.  With all due respect to the Robert Fripp fans out there (I guess that sort of includes me) the greatness of 'Discipline' is due to the incredible synergy developed by the other three musicians. Bruford of Yes goes through time signature changes like warm butter.  Tony Levin is a master of both the bass and the stick.  And then there is Adrian Belew, perhaps the most underrated artist in rock music. Listen to the passion in his voice and then his sustained guitar refrains on 'Mate Kudasai.'  No one plays guitar like that anymore. When I saw David Bowie live at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1990,  Belew was the lead guitarist, and Bowie's music never sounded more powerful.  This is one of the most intelligent statements ever made on disc.  Listen and learn.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film.  While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments.  It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element.  It needed something more.  At the time I couldn't put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was.  Maturity.  This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film.  They lacked connectiveness to the average person.  I couldn't see myself in this situation.  Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldn't capture the moment.  In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.<br /><br />They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own.  They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human.  From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation.  I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did.  I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment, and Jesse's distraught marriage.  It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives.  Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other, it worked.  I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other.  It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing.<br /><br />What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors.  They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community.  This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years.  His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine.  His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love.  He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened.  You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again.  It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see.  The same goes for Delpy.  At the beginning of this film, I didn't like her character.  She seemed rough and rigid around the edges, constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didn't want Hawke to know.  As her character grew in this film, I understood why.  She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did.  While he still longed for Celine in his heart, he did move on.  She longed for Jesse in her heart, and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity.  I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing.  Did she remember their night together?  Did she really loose her grandmother, or did she just not show up that day in Vienna?  Was the song just for Jesse?  So many questions left me wanting more and more and more.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him.  He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original.  He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city.  The language in this film is intense.  Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives.  There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind.  Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility.<br /><br />Overall, this was a brilliant film.  Linklater captured the essence of these two heart-struck people and proved that it could be filmed.  This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over.  The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie.  This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year.  If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset, I suggest that you check this out.  It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could.  I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year.  Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****s that will remain on your minds far after the film is over.

0679759328|2.0|Hotel du Lac, Brookner's fourth novel, reminds one very much of Henry James, Katherine Mansfield and, most of all, that mistress in ironic observation, Jane Austen.  Her prose style could be a delight, and is at best refreshingly limpid.   <br /> <br />Yet by the time I came to the end of this short novel, I had felt Brookner was writing a novel based on style with very little substance.  The barren plot cringes, the characters are stock and two-dimensional, and the protagonist concerns herself with trivialities and broods and broods...about nothing really worth at all.  The deus ex machina is perhaps the most unbelievable--a protagonist who falls into the same trap *twice* over the course of the book is simply not credible enough.  In the end romance novelist Edith Hope elicits very little sympathy; whereas one comes out of an Austen or James novel feeling older and wiser, one feels here that Brookner is extending her tentacles very tentatively at something supposedly profound, without reaching it at all.  One star for the style, and another for making me finish the book, which is quite a feat.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|This review took me some time to write, rewrite, and confirm my thoughts.  Over the course of two days, I had to think about this film to make sure that I was putting my correct words down on paper.  This film was reminiscent of an airplane take-off.  As the plane begins for take-off it taxis around the runway (opening credits) and then gets its engines up to full throttle before eventually lifting into the air (the beginning of the film), but once in the air, we coast and outside of some brief turbulence, you have a smooth flight the rest of the trip.  That is how I felt about the film Elf.  Director Favreau (of Swingers fame) bursts onto this film with such raw imagination and humor that by the time he gets to New York City, he is panting for air and eventually tired of the entire endeavor.  With a medium to medium rare Ferrell, Favreau starts this story with amazing imagery, some moments of classic Christmas television memories, and powerful creativity, but in the end it all reads like a Hollywood playbook.  Everyone is in their positions, let's play a good game.<br /><br />Ferrell is a very funny actor.  In fact, I praise him for the return of the \\"funny\\" comedy with his work in Anchorman, but in this film it just feels as if he is going through the motions without the emotion.  You could tell that he just didn't feel as comfortable in his role of Buddy as he did as Ron Burgundy.  Farrell, and perhaps it was more the writers fault, provided no really memorable lines that the kids will be quoting for years to come nor did he do anything that wasn't already expected of him.  I don't think this was his sled, for lack of a better word.  Then again, perhaps it didn't work for me because he didn't have the backup he needed.  Ferrell is one of those comic geniuses that play off other actors very well and some of the most memorable Ferrell moments are when he is ad-libbing with others.  James Caan was a horrible choice as the father.  He is cranky, yes, but not from acting.  I couldn't help but cringe when I saw him at the end of this film, he was pathetic.  I couldn't tell if he was interested in this film, or just needed some extra cash.  I felt the same about the rest of the cast that surrounded Ferrell.  Deschanel and Steenburgen were completely miscast and literally just walked through the motions spewing lines from their mouths to pay for their new car.  The best example is when Zooey says to Ferrell, \\"You missed\\" during the romantic scene.  It was worse than poor and amateurish.  Wasted talent from Sedaris and Richter only angered me further.  The only saving actor from this entire film was Dinklage.  He was hysterical and commanded the screen for the few minutes he was on literally stealing the scene from Ferrell.  It was a plus in an already full film of minuses.<br /><br />For this film to really be pinnacle Christmas achievement, it needed some powerful writing that would just have you in your seat laughing because of the words behind Ferrell.  Sadly, that could not be found in this film.  There wasn't enough originality in the script to make this film really stand out.  I saw a glimmer of it when the film began with some of the CGI animals, but that was lost indefinitely after the first ten minutes.  When I first started watching this film, I saw it as a combination of all of our favorite Christmas programs.  This perception ended when Buddy made it to New York.  Riding in a clich&eacute; drawn horse and sleigh, we follow Buddy through New York as he attempts to bring humor to the simplest of situations.  It felt as if when Favreau found a joke, he never let it go, nearly killing the fun each time.  The syrup joke is the first that comes to mind.  The second was entire Central Park episode.  Everyone involved couldn't pick up the pieces from that \\"crash and burn\\".<br /><br />While it sounds like I am sitting here furiously upset with this film, I am not.  I went into the film with high expectations, but was left with only medium results.  Ferrell was funny, but not Ferrell-funny.  He was scripted, almost to the point where you could count his beats.  This was a holiday movie, but not one that will be played over and over again in this house.  Overall, it was disappointing, but thanks to a little help from Dinklage, it seemed just a tad bit better.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****ly medium results.

0393035158|5.0|This extremely important book is nothing less than a twenty-first century variation of Martin Luther's 95 Theses that he nailed to the door of the Wittenburg Church. Whereas Luther was calling for a much-needed reformation of church policies in the name of honesty, Harris is calling for a complete revolution in the name of reason, and he more than makes his case. All of his points are clear, reasonable, and persuasive. His call for a new dialogue on faith is  sorely needed. Every thinking person should read and discuss this book - it could literally save the planet.
B0006AZMFM|2.0|Got 'Innocent Eyes'?<br />Well, these songs are just more of the same - permutations of the same themes in a trillion other pop songs sung by a trillion other male and female pop singers for the last fifty years. Delta Goodrem doesn't deal with any ideas the average twelve year old couldn't grasp. Looking for insights? Looking for a personal reflection on the meaning of life? Looking for a unique perspective on the world and people? Looking for wit and wisdom? Looking for comment on the world around us? Looking for a complex and fascinating puzzle of musical ideas and lyrics? Looking for musical 'edges' and cool chord sequences?<br />Well, look elsewhere!<br /><br />I don't doubt for a moment that as much or more effort went into the cover photograph and the layout of this CD as the actual music contained on this amazingly prosaic and jejune product.<br /><br />What does Delta Goodrem have to say to the world? Well, after hearing this album a number of times I am none the wiser. However, I suspect that her 'message' is, if anything, \\"please buy me!\\" and \\"I need your money and adoration! My ego needs it!\\".<br /><br />If there was some whimsey or humour in what she did, I would be willing to forgive her for churning out so much mediocre music. I am not sure how she could do this. Sing a song by Morrisey? \\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\\" or \\"You're the one for me, fatty\\" would be great coming from Ms Goodrem!<br /><br />Perhaps she needs to work with a much more 'left of centre' group of musicians? Mandy Moore did an album of very oblique cover versions and proved that she was something more that a pouting pop princess.<br /><br />At the moment, Delta Goodrem is merely a potential with a pretty face and that is just about the only nice thing I can say about her and this album. If you want heart breaking pop - listen to Karen Carpenter. If you want pop with a  beat and a club feel - you'd choose Kylie Minogue. If you want female pop/rock with 'edge' - you could improve on Debbie Harry and Blondie. If you want absolutely mindless trash - you'd listen to Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears. Style? - listen to Sade or Ute Lemper! A massive voice? - go for Chaka Khan. Jazz-Cabaret? - Belle du Berry from Paris Combo.<br /><br />I am just uncertain what Delta Goodrem albums are supposed to offer the listener? Maybe they really are simply a money making excercise for Ms Goodrem, who wants to continue to bankroll a jet-setter lifestyle[...]utely mindless trash - you'd listen to Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears.

B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's Nevermind is total bullsh*t. I can respect Bleach and Incesticide because the songs off those albums were recorded when the band actually were dirt-poor and somewhat genuine, but when Nevermind made Kurt richer than he'll ever be in all of his future lives combined, he really needed to start dressing like the rich snob he was living as. It's an insult to poverty-stricken people and fans alike when a multi-millionaire like Cobain purposely tried to publicly hide how much of a spoiled brat he was. He only let his closest drug dealers see that side of him. Kurt should've turned all that heroin money from Geffen down. Yes, folks, Cobain was the ultimate tool. When Cobain acted like he had no reason to live after he'd gotten millions of dollars from singing about how he wanted to die, it never did tug on my heartstrings like it does all hoodie-wearing preteens. He had it better than any of us will know. Boo-hoo.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This is the first question viewers ask about a documentary. Guess what, all documentarians push their beliefs of the subject matter in their films. That's why they make them. I didn't give this film 5 stars because I believe every word said. I gave it 5 stars because it opened my eyes. I have never been interested in politics. I didn't follow the progress of this war. Therefore I didn't vote in the 2004 election. After watching this film I hate myself for that. I feel in some way responsible for whatever else happens in this war because of my stupidity in turning my back. Excellent films do more than entertain. They force you to think and feel emotion. This film did that and more for me. I thank you Michael Moore.
B000003TA4|5.0|Every few years, we get into grooves where pop bands will pose as rock bands and nobody knows the difference.  Nowadays, we have New Found Glory and Blink-182, and in the late 80's, we had hair metal, but in 1991, Nirvana finally came along with \\"Nevermind\\".  It was like lighting a match, throwing it into Poison's sprayed hair and watching the whole thing burst into flames.  Aside from leading a musical revolution, it had great music.  \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is an impossible to hate classic.  From the opening guitar, you know it's something special.  \\"In Bloom\\" \\"Breed\\" and \\"Lithium\\" are all hard-rock masterpieces.  \\"Polly\\" is the song where the emotion from every song gets a chance to shine trough by going acoustic.  All in all, the raw, energy of this album is the big aspect.  When Kurt Cobain loses his voice on \\"Drain You\\", you know that this is real hard rock.  If you like rock, you need this album

B000002JSN|5.0|An essectial Rock'n'Roll debate is disc one or disc two of physical grafitti.  Disc one has \\"Kashmir\\", which stands as one of the greatest led zeppelin songs. It has a classic string intro and a famtastic outburst of trumpets to make eight and a half minutes of greatness.  Another masterpiece of disc one is \\"The Rover\\", which is a great hard rock piece of the album.  A definite stand-out of disc one is \\"Trampled Under Foot\\".  With this, they take \\"The Crunge\\" and basically turn it into a good song, by using a funk organ and a very catchy tune.  Disc two has \\"Sick Again\\", which is just an awesome hard rock song.  Then there's \\"In the Light\\", an epic mix of arabian music, hard rock, and country, making for an amazing song.  Another favorite of mine is \\"Down by the Seaside\\", a fun country-inspired rock'n'roll song, but a song on Disc two that is truly ground-breaking is \\"Ten Years Gone\\".  The opening guitar is both classic and soulful. Then, the songs kicks into a rock/orchestral masterpiece.  In the end, I choose disc two but it's a tough competition.  Both discs are worth the purchase of this amazing album.

If you are just interested in knowing what is behind successful entrepreneurs this will give you a good inside look at what you have to do and mainly what not to do. <br /> <br />If you are not interested in entrepreneurial at least borrow the book from someone else and read the last chapter.
B000021XS0|5.0|You can get on here and write some long review that few will read about how \\"Zappa came out with different stuff everytime\\" and how \\"He's really more progressive\\" but the truth of the matter is that Dream Theater has proved their musical genius to be effective around the world.  Their songs, while complex are fun to listen to.  From the people who pick apart music to the people who just want a catchy tune, Dream Theater delivers.  For the average rock fan they will impress.  For the avid Progressive Rock fan, they will astonish.  Personally, when i discovered Dream Theater it was like opening a box to a music world that has been left undiscovered.  If you appreciate GOOD music with musicians that put time and effort into each and every one of their songs NOT for the purpose of making millions but for the purpose of music than Dream Theater is the band for you.  The combination of Various time signatures, complex soloing, musical prodigies tending every instrament, and elaborate melodies will leave you begging for more.  Dream Theater is truely a gift to the music world.  Buy it now!
B00009ATIX|5.0|This film is deeply affecting, poignant and beautiful. It explores themes of death, bereavement, love, religion, and questions our existence as human beings. It has no Hollywood glamour, no huge explosions or fight scenes, no gratuitous sex scenes. It is subtle and moving. If you like a film to engage you on more than a visual, thrill seeking level this is definitely one you should see. It is not a film with any conclusion and it will leave you with something. It is certainly not boring as some other reviews suggest, but of course is not everyone's cup of tea. This is merely my opinion and is only as valid as the rest of these reviews.
B00005JMUL|5.0|With this film, Christmas has officially started. This flick is a first-class CGI animation adventure. The story, for those who don't know, is about a boy who has somewhat lost the magic of believing in Santa Claus and is dreaming of visiting the North Pole to find out. On Christmas eve the magical \\"Polar Express\\" stops in front of his house and invites him to join the ride to the North Pole. The journey is fantastic and often it feels like a roller coaster going up and down step scenic mountains over a frozen lake, etc. to the final destination of the city of North Pole where elfs and Santa reside working around the clock to get everything ready for Christmas. The story also involves various characters from the lonely outcast boy to the caring little girl to the selfish little brat and so on. It's a relaxing Christmas adventure for the whole family with lots of drama,but with happy endings. Take your kids to see this film as it will get you into the Christmas mood. This movie is extremely well done and may become a classic in more than one way.

B0006AZMFM|5.0|With Innocent Eyes, Delta Goodrem, a beautiful, talented young Australian singer, delivered to the world one of the best pop albums in living memory, complete with five number 1 singles and not a filler track in sight. Suffice to say, she had her work cut out for her in bringing her sophomore album up to the level of the original, and after a tough year battling cancer and very public failed relationships, I am ecstatic to say that Delta has returned with an album that surpasses its predecessor in every way imaginable. <br /> <br />The lyrics are more mature and the mood of the album is much darker than IE. Much credit must go to her though for avoiding turning MI into a \\"woe is me\\" album, which would have been all too easy. She has branched out into more areas here, bringing us jazzy tunes such as 'Miscommunication', quirky numbers like 'Mistaken Identity', soaring orchestral tracks as in 'Sanctuary' and even some rather powerful theatricals in 'Nobody Listened'. On top of this there's a good array of powerful piano-driven ballads such as 'Be Strong' and 'Fragile' and some rockier pieces of which 'Electric Strom' is the standout. The following is a trck by track rundown of the album. <br /> <br />1. OUT OF THE BLUE - The first single off the album spent 3 straight weeks at number one in oz and is tear-inducing in it's beautiful storytelling of Delta's recovery from cancer and how she met her lover 'out of the blue'. This song takes surprising twists and turns, switching between sweet piano moments then hitting us with layers of sound in the chorus, all perectly ballanced here and Delta's vocals are above excellent. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />2. THE ANALYST - wonderful auto-biographical track written in third person talking about how she always over-analyses everything. The 'Doctor Who'-like opening music is particularly notable. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. MISTAKEN IDENTITY - The title track is certainly a highlight on a brilliant CD. It is hard to classify as it is very jazzy and quirky, even Tori Amos-like in flavour. The lyrics are top notch, the tune carries you along like no other, and I love the way it ends with Delta rambling off. It's easy to see why it's Delta's favourite on the CD. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. EXTROARDINARY DAY - This song more than any other focuses on her cancer struggle, documenting the day she found out the news that she had Hodgkinson's disease. This song is very dark and haunting and truly fantastic all round. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />5. A LITTLE TOO LATE - Very similar to 'Throw It Away', my favourite track on IE, with its breezy guitar chords at the beginning and throughout, as well as the distinct sound of the backing vocals and the mid-tempo pace. So naturally it is one of my favourites on MI. This song is just so fun, and like 'Throw It Away', breaks up a very overwhelming and dark album wonderfully. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. BE STRONG - The most powerful ballad on the CD, was written by Delta for her friend Belinda Emmet, who was also suffering from cancer, basically saying \\"I know how you feel, just hang on and be strong\\". Moving, with great piano music and perfectly sung, this track is another album highlight. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. ELECTRIC STORM - As far as I'm concerned, this is probably the best song Delta has ever recorded. It is so powerful and elecrtifying to listen to, that listening to it feels like nothing short of being caught up in an electric storm. The electric guitars here make this song reminiscent of 'Predictable', one of the best songs on IE, and the vocals here are beyond perfect. 11/10!!! <br /> <br />8. ALMOST HERE - A great, touching duet sung by Delta and ex-Westlife singer Brian McFadden. The chorus is powerful and the two voices suit perfectly. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. MISCOMMUNICATION - Possibly the most unusual song Delta has yet sung. This song definately belongs to older era with its jazzy/cabaret feel, you could imagine this being sung in a musical. Delightful in its uniqueness. 9/10 <br /><br />10. SANCTUARY - This song throws up walls of orchestral sounds towards the end making it a memorable listen. The vocals are very strong here, and the lyrics are simple but effective. 8/10 <br /> <br />11. LAST NIGHT ON EARTH - Powerful thanks to its haunting piano intro, and the sheer emotion Delta invests in the chorus. A fan favourite, and one of the more catchy and poppy tunes on the album, this song is however never corny and always sincere and beautiful. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. FRAGILE - Reminiscent of 'Will You Fall For Me' on IE due to its simplistic piano-and-Delta alone makeup. I am pleased a song like this is on here as it utilises Delta's talent to the greatest extent and the lyrics here are most impressive. 8/10 <br /> <br />13. DISORIENTATED - A truly crazy song that certainly leaves you feeling disorientated by the end. Delta rambles on about the rising moon and clocks ticking backwards and it's all great fun. Most significant here is the great music box-like backing vocals. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />14. YOU ARE MY ROCK - One of the best ballads Delta has recorded. Dedicated to her brother Trent, it is not as simplistic as 'Fragile' nor as overwhelming as 'Be Strong', it is simple exquisite and understated. The last few lines are lovely and a perfect way to 'end' the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />BONUS TRACK. NOBODY LISTENED - But wait! A few minutes after 'You Are My Rock' begins the most out-there tune Delta has sung. Venting all her sarcasm and rage on the listener, this rockier-edged tune takes you by surprise and knocks you for six. 9/10 <br /> <br />In all, the wonderful thing about this CD is I simple do not have a least favourite song. Even IE went through weaker patches around the middle, not so MI. What's also great about it is that it truly feels like we as the listener are going on a journey through the past year of Delta's life as we listen to her music. And it is the way she draws you in like that and makes each of her CDs a real journey through a different stage of her life that sets her apart from almost everyone esle out there on the music scene and why her fans adore her and feel closer to her than any other singer's fans ever could. I for one am eagerly anticipating the next stage in Delta's incredible musical journey... <br /> <br />10/10
0140277447|5.0|Even today, hundreds of millions of people from all over the world are reminded every year of the anti-humanity crimes committed by the Third Reich during world war II, even though today's Germany is not the Third Reich anymore and the new generation germans have grown up. Just look at what is on TV during the week of rememberance each year! Why the Japs can get away with their crimes? why can't the Japs being reminded every year? who gives them the priveledge to deny? why the then Japanese emperor, the man who masterminded the Pacific war, can die in peace without being hung???? Why the japanese veterans and murderers still live in great glory today???  <br /> <br />Unlike the war in Europe, lots of issues regarding the Pacific war are still unclear today, mainly due to the ideological conflict between China and the United States since 1949. And, I believe all those remaining issues will be looked at eventually, hopefully that day is not far away.
6304698682|3.0|PALE RIDER is Clint Eastwood's heartfelt and somewhat disappointing homage to George Steven's classic SHANE.  It looks fine, has a strong cast and satisfying enough action, but there's something amiss.  Somehow it worked better when it was ranchers threatening sodbusters than big miners threatening little miners.  Maybe Alan Ladd helping Van Heflin bust out a stump was a little more heroic than Eastwood helping Michael Moriarty break a rock.<br /><br /> In Shane Ladd created a rough western prototype of the quiet, mysterious stranger blown in on a strange wind to clean out the bad guys.  Eastwood refined the model and rode it to stardom.  Eastwood's scowl-squint-and-shoot Man With No Name is one of the most highly polished movie icon ever.  It's small wonder Eastwood would look back to SHANE with fond gratitude.<br /><br />  In PALE RIDER, Eastwood's character, Preacher, may have ridden into the grub mining town on a heavenly wind.  The movie hints at supernatural origins, anyway.  It may have been divine intervention that led the two lead actresses, mother Carrie Snodgress and daughter Sydney Penny, to so abruptly fall and declare their love for him. The declaration scenes are forced and awkward.  PALE RIDER doesn't really show us how or why the women feel this way, and the plot doesn't need it.  In the end, all it really does is delay the action.  Another mystery - what the heck is Richard Kiel (James Bond's Jaws) character all about?  He seems to be a Dense Thug with Pure Heart type, but the movie pulls him out of the oven half-baked.<br /><br />  The big problem, though, is that the movie takes so long before letting Clint be Clint.  Well over half the movie is over before he trades in the clerical collar for the gun.  Even then the final showdown, although well choreographed, is uninspired and a tad flat.<br /><br />  For his fans Eastwood never made a bad film, and PALE RIDER has enough going for it to make it enjoyable.  I like to think it was a test run for Eastwood's next western, the classic UNFORGIVEN.estern, the classic UNFORGIVEN.  <br />

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|First of all, for everyone who keeps writing \\"why isn't this included\\" and \\"what happened to this performance?\\"--READ THE NOTES in the booklet. It explains what they were able to restore, find and use. They're lucky that they were able to get any of the JFK/Philly stuff. So enjoy this DVD collection for what it is and what IS on it. This is an incredible set of live music from an amazing day in 1985 that none of us should ever forget. The set by Queen is still one of the most amazing live sets ever performed. Long overdue and well worth the wait. Thanks Bob Geldof. Enjoy!
B000021XS0|1.0|I have already written my thesis on DreamTheater, but I feel the salient points need reiterating here for the benefit of any normal people who accidentally find this page. In short, Dreamtheater is a band of technically skilled musicians who simply cannot write music. When I buy an album, I want it to be something that has some sort of emotional impact. I Don't want to sit there and think \\"Whoa, like, how many notes can Petrucci play in a given time interval? That's totally rad - to the max\\". Unfortunately, this album falls into the latter category. <br /> <br />Now, I mentioned that these are skilled musicians. In fact, that was a bit of an understatement. You might not be able to understand why I've given it one star then - I will tell you why in the following handy set of bullet-points: <br />- They are too wrapped up in their own immense egos to cooperate as a band. This leads on to my next point, <br />- While the part of each instrument is complex, there is no use of harmonisation or counterpoint between instruments. If you watch the live metropolis DVD, you will see that every band member plays the exact same riff, throughout the whole album. The music is therefore totally flat, amateurish and poorly constructed _despite_ the individual talents on display. <br />- Portnoy's drumming consists of hitting the bass pedal every time another band member plays a note on guitar, bass or keyboard. This means that the bass pedal vibrates at about 20 beats per second in places. Now, this is physically impressive but musically uninteresting, and you have to admit that despite the great speed in places, the actual rhythms he makes aren't at all complicated. There's little syncopation or other rhythmically interesting features, just very fast pedalling. Hooray. <br />- The lyrics are universally awful, a fact admitted by even the most devoted fans on these reviews. If you're looking for intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics, you're looking at the wrong album. Wrong band. Wrong genre, to be brutally honest. <br />- The acting is.... is..... unbelievable. I don't know how to convey this, but suffice to say you will want to be sitting down, not eating or drinking anything, when you hear the album's finale. Otherwise you have a severe risk of choking. <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, there is no reason for this band to be together. Personally I think they should split up and become session musicians for people who can write songs. Let's face it, that would have more artistic integrity than this suspicious brown-colored stain on contemporary music.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane really proved themselves to be a versatile band yet, never forgets to maintain their uniqueness .. which makes them Keane.  A cross between U2 and Coldplay .. Keane's lead singers has the voice of Bono but the sensitivity of Coldplay; however, Keane's less spastic than U2 and not as stuffy as Coldplay. <br /> <br />Keane also brought back the \\"nice\\" flavor of bands fromt eh 60's and 70's. <br /> <br />I popped in this CD on my 1.5hr stop 'n go commute .. made me a completely relaxed and even happy commuter. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great CD to own .. not a one-time listen 'n drop it album .. and definitely not an album with only one good song .. it's truly one of the best that I've heard in a LONG time! <br /> <br />enjoy :) <br />
B0000028M7|5.0|This is groundbreaking material that many bands have tried to leech off of since it was released. At the same time, those bands have failed to capture the true unique greatness that made Alice in Chains special. I recommend it to anyone who is sick of today's corporate music and needs something to mend their frustrated attitude towards the current state in music. This album is simply one of a kind and has nothing but great songs, as all the songs by Alice in Chains are great. Some songs will be instantly appealing, such as Them Bomes, Dam That River, Rain When I Die, Down in a Hole, Rooster, and Would. The rest will grow on you and will be even more liked such as Sickman, Junkhead, Dirt, God Smack, Hate to Feel, and Angry Chair. Track 10 is just a 50 second intro to Hate to Feel, and is meant to immitate and make a parody of the intro to Iron Man by Black Sabbath. All the AIC CDs are great. Buy them all!
B0002Y4T92|4.0|Yes eric is a great guitar player,yes all the performers are great guitar players but the best thing about the dvd is the history lessons that they tell.I already know that no one can match licks with eric but what i didnt know is the storys of him in grade school,the storys of robert johnson....this is what makes it great.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is absolutely the most complete, just the sheer fact that 1 out of every 20 persons under 50 owns a copy of this album makes it one of the best ever created.  Not only does this album play like an epic film, it is also a timeless piece of music that will be cherished for the next generations to come.  I fell in love with this album when i purchased it before an overseas trip.  After hearing it from beginning to end, i had to hear it again, and i did so five more times.  This is not an album to skip around and find your favorite song.  It is best enjoyed fully played out from start to finish with no itteruptions.  Believe me, its worth it.  <br /> <br />Speak To Me/ Breathe- The first part to this two part song begins with a general introduction of all that is to come, all beginning with a human heart beating.  There are very short and subtle hints towards what is to come.  The second part is very laid back and mellow, i could listen to this part over and over again.   <br /> <br />On The Run- This song is a stark contrast to Speak To Me/Breathe.  It is a fast pace hi-hat and keyboard rhythm that puts you into a transe like state, Very psycadelic.   <br /> <br />Time-  Argueably the best song on the album and overall for the band.  After being entranced in On The Run, you are woken up by clock alarms that lead into a steady beat consisting of bells and open drums.  The intersting part is how it is all to the beat of a human heart, almost creepy.  One of my favorite musical moments of all time is when Waters comes in, it blew me away the first time, i had to repeat and hear it again.  You hear a little bit of the mellowness of Breathe for a time then Gilmore breaks into one of his many beautiful and emotional guitar solos, he has a way of wailing away without over duing it.  Pink Floyd's brilliant mix of back up vocals and harmonies is what makes them stand out in the rock n roll world.  My favorite DSOTM song.  <br /> <br />The Great Gig In The Sky-  One of the best vocal performances ever, she it utterly amazing on how much emotions this woman puts into this choral masterpiece.  Even though she does not say a word, her emotion tells you exactly what she means.  The amazing fact is she was paid the equivilant of only $50 American dollars to sing for the band. <br /> <br />Money-  Another favorite of mine, the most radio and general public song on the album.  Water's bass line is very predominant.  A very jazzy/blues song with an invigorating, and allaround awesome saxaphone solo.  Soon, the whole band is going and it what makes so many people love Pink Floyd.  Gilmore again, busts another excellent guitar solo, a favorite for any rock fan.   <br /> <br />Us And Them- Again, like Breathe to On the Run, the total mood of the album changes again.  From the up beat, jazzy Money, to the solem and subtle Us And Them.  This, along with Time, shows the bands soft and poetic side.  Saxaphone starts this one, leading to vocals that just put you in a mood that relax you like no other.  This song is another favorite because is has a deeper meaning, speaking of human conflict.  Again, the brilliance of vocals and harmony produce one of the emotional climaxes this album reaches.   <br /> <br />Any Colour You Like- The most psychadelic song on the album, keyboardist Rick Wright does his magic along with a very creative guitar back and foreth.  Jazzy, laid back, and imaginative, one to enjoy. <br /> <br />Brain Damage- The climax of the film.  As i said in the intro, DSOTM is very much like a film, and this would be the climax, where it all comes to a head.  Again, the harmony of vocals and instruments come together create one of the coolest moments one will ever hear in music.   <br /> <br />Elipse- One of the intersting things about DSOTM is the sleamless transistion from song to song, this is one of those.  Again, the vocals and intruments come to a very emotional and climatic finish, where, like the beginning, ends with the sound of a human heart. <br /> <br />One of the greatest albums ever made, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is so great becuase it would not be the same album if just one song was removed or added.  Unlike most bands, songs are added and replaced just to fill disc time or in no particular order.  DSOTM is the musical equivilant to an epic film, all coming to a climatic finish.  This album has totally changed my perception of what an album can be.  Dark Side of the Moon will be an album that generation after generation will find in their dad's basement and fall in love with.  If you've never heard and PF before and are curious, this is a great one to start out with.  But remember, take some time with this one, dont skip around, and listed from the first track to the last.  You wouldn't do that with a great movie would you? <br />
B000003TAR|5.0|If you were to ask me what my favorite Nirvana album is...this wouldn't be it. That honor goes to Bleach. However, this does not stop me from saying that In Utero is Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl's most valid statement in the world of rock.  <br /> <br />Nevermind was just grunge pop tunes that sound too slick. It's production is dated and is typical of the late 80's-early 90's Seattle grunge explosion. Don't get me wrong, I like the album, but that's just what it was. <br /> <br />In Utero on the other hand, hasn't aged a smidge. <br /> <br />Serve The Servents is one of the most powerful openings to an album ever. The now infamous line, \\"Teenage angst has paid off well...now I'm bored and old\\" reflects Cobain's personality at the time of recording this record. And the album delivers one great song after the other (Scentless Apprentice, Heart-Shaped Box, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter), and doesn't let up until the last song, Nirvana's greatest song All Apologies. Kurt's yells of \\"MARRIED...BURIED\\" eerily predict what was to come after this album was recorded and released. Another great line is \\"All in all is all we are\\".  <br /> <br />Surprisingly, Rape Me is my least favorite song on the album. The lyrics are not up to the standard that I would expect from a Cobain song, and it is basically just the chords from Smells Like Teen Spirit played backwards. My favorite song on the album has to be Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (\\"I miss the comfort in feeling sad\\"). <br /> <br />Kurt may've not been the best guitar player ever, but at least he could write beautiful songs. Krist Novoselic was a damn good bass player, and Dave Grohl was a fantastic drummer. All of their collective talents came full circle with this album, and it will get its due in the forthcoming years. <br /> <br />If you like this album, try Nevermind, or perhaps take an interest in The Vaselines, or Sonic Youth.
B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam is a band who, although they started out selling millions of discs, has survived as a result of their dedicated fans.  A lot of their fans will certainly have problems with this compilation because it doesn't carry their personal favorites.  That's always going to be a concern when it comes to bands who aren't simply \\"hit single-formula based.\\"  However, most bands put out greatest hits discs, and with that in mind, this is an outstanding collection!  All of the big hits are here, as well as \\"Yellow Ledbetter,\\" which every diehard knows.  It also carries the two tracks they did for the movie \\"Singles,\\" way back in 1992.  Those songs, \\"Breath\\" and \\"State of Love and Trust,\\" are excellent.  I also like how both discs are in chronological order, with the harder stuff on disc one, the less-hard, but definitely not soft songs, on disc 2.  This is a wonderful place for people who don't own any of the full-length CDs to start, and it should satisfy those of us who have been following this terrific group since 1991.
B000669GAI|4.0|rearviewmirror, the new Greatest Hits package from Pearl Jam is a supurb introduction for new fans, and a good collectors piece for diehards. The 5 tracks from 'Ten', their undisputable masterpiece, (except Even Flow...that mysteriously has an alternate take in place of the album version. In my honest opinion, the album version is superior.) have been re-produced to take away the glorified, arena rock production the original album had. The tracks have never sounded better. <br /> <br />All of the other tracks of the CD are the same from the original albums. <br /> <br />Although I would've liked to see a few more tracks on the listing, I am still happy with what they put on the disc. All of the classics are here: Jeremy, Black, Daughter, the aformentioned alternate take of Even Flow, Betterman, Alive...plus 27 more from other assorted albums (classics such as 'Vs', 'Vitalogy', and 'No Code') and even Yellow Ledbetter from the 'Lost Dogs' compiliation of B-sides. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a wonderful compiliation, but a few more classics (Tremor Christ is the most notable) would've really made this essential. <br /> <br />If you like this album, try all of Pearl Jam's other albums or perhaps Alice In Chains or Soundgarden.
1592400876|5.0|I apologize that I have not read the book, although it does sound interesting.  I just had to comment that, even in the United States, enormity implies wickedness.  Anyone who uses the word to refer only to magnitude is incorrect.
B00004SCX6|3.0|It is hardly surprising that Britney Spear's sophomore offering, \\"Oops... I Did It Again\\", has a very similar style to her debut. Seeing as her debut was so popular, why would they want to mess with a formula that worked? Teaming up once more with Swedish producer, Max Martin, Britney manages to cover some of her vocal shortcomings with pounding, danceable beats however he still allows her some ballads. Without his production, these songs show off the weakness of Britney's voice. While her ballads sounded great on her debut, Max seemed to forget how to make it work properly. Otherwise, Britney's voice is often computerized (as evidenced by the first two songs) but occasionally sounds great. The album seems like a watered down version of Britney's debut. While there are some great songs on this one, they are not overly memorable as compared to the rest of her material.  <br /> <br />The album starts off with the overly computerized title track, \\"Oops I Did It Again\\". The song seems to discuss accidentally leading someone on. Except for being mildly overproduced, the song sounds great up until the pointless spoken interlude in the middle. (\\"Britney, before you go, there's something you have to have...\\" etc.). \\"Stronger\\" is much better as it has a more positive message. It also seems more like a sequel to \\"Baby One More Time\\". (\\"My loneliness ain't killing me no more\\"). This song discusses how Britney tells a guy that she isn't his property any more and that she is stronger then before. Britney actually does not sound too bad in this one, mostly because of the great background music. \\"Don't Go Knockin On My Door\\" tries to be mature but fails seeing as it contains lines such as \\"totally unblue when I hear myself saying...\\".  Britney actually fits quite well with the beat but the song suffers mostly from poor lyrics and weak rhyme patterns.  <br /> <br />Britney potentially bit off more then she could chew when she decided to cover the Rolling Stone's \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\". Maybe because I have not heard the original song, but I do not find this song nearly as awful as most claim.  It is far from Britney's best song, but is a nice addition to the album nonetheless. \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" is the first of quite a few subpar ballads. The song discusses how in order to believe someone really loves you, you have to hear it from them and not from everyone else. Where the song could have been sweet, it comes off bland and boring. It is weakened further by Britney's weak vocals. \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" sounds far better though mildly overproduced. In it, Britney talks about a guy who tries to change her but she rejects him. The bridge sounds particularly strong. (\\"Believe me, you'll be lookin' for trouble...\\"). This song features the first of a few short, spoken interludes at the end which really detracts from the quality.  <br /> <br />\\"Lucky\\" seems semi-biographical (I would say auto-biographical but Britney did not write the song) but at the same time kind of forced.  The song talks about the loneliness of the Hollywood-life and while the song made a nice single for some time, it is far from Britney's best material. It is hindered even further by the spoken part in the middle. (\\"And the winner is... Lucky!...\\"). The next two songs, \\"One Kiss From You\\" and \\"Where Are You Now?\\" sound almost identical, however neither of them is particularly good. In fact, they both seem extremely bland and do little more then show the weakness of Britney's voice. Even though \\"One Kiss From You\\" is mid-tempo and \\"Where Are You Now\\" is a ballad, they are hard to distinguish from one another and not at all memorable. <br /> <br />\\"Can't Make You Love Me\\" is actually one of the better songs. It is upbeat and features some great production that only occasionally overshadows Britney. The only major downside is that there are far too many background singers in the chorus. This song is not one that most people remember when thinking ofthe album but it is by far one of the best. \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" is yet another sappy ballad that seems to have been added merely to get some change of pace between songs. The chorus is repeated far too many times, although the music is decent. It is extremely difficult to hear what Britney is singing because she often uses her \\"whispery\\" voice. Lastly, there is \\"Dear Diary\\", Britney's first attempt at songwriting. And maybe Britney should have left it to the professionals. Though the song has beautiful music, it suffers from incredibly weak vocals and amateur writing styles. Obviously the song will not be written well, since it was not written by a professional, however one would expect more than a diary entry (which  is exactly what this sounds like) as a song. <br /> <br />Overall Mark: 3/5 <br /> <br />Overall, this album does not even come close to reaching \\"Baby One More Time\\". First and foremost, if Britney is going to insist on singing ballads, she should really rehire the writers and producers who created \\"From The Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" and the like from her debut. The ones who created the ballads for this album just did not know how to make them work with Britney's voice. Secondly, Britney has got to get rid of the spoken interludes in the middle of and at the end of songs. They are extremely annoying and do nothing to add to the album. Thirdly, Britney needs to improve her vocals so that her albums do not need to be as overproduced as this one. She only really shines when her voice is half covered by the beat. What does that really say about her? Overall, Britney tried too hard to recreate her debut but packed in too many ballads. Give this a shot if you want, but definitely borrow it first.
B0000640S3|3.0|First up, this is not a very good movie. However, those who apply current context to the politics of the film (as most reviewers seem to be doing) are missing the point. Back when this film was made, America (the CIA) was sponsoring the Taliban resistance to the Soviet occupation. They didn't care that the Taliban were bloodthirsty troglodytes. It only mattered that they were contributing to the military-industrial collapse of the Soviet Union (and thus winning the Cold War). Atrocities be damned, this was one for the Gipper. In a perfect world there would be a Rambo equivalent in Russian cinema who goes to Iraq to help the insurgency battle the American infadels. <br /> <br />At any rate, in context the film is only marginally successful. It is well made and features several tense action sequences. The dialog is (and was at the time) Reagan-era tripe. If you check your brain at the door you might find this a reasonable 100 minute diversion.
B000059TEP|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of my all-time favorites. And no matter how many times I see this movie it still makes me cry. Patrick Swayzee and Demi Moore are the perfect couple in this movie. And Whoopee Goldberg does a great job too.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Its always a good feeling to buy an album on a whim, and to discover that it is one of the most amazing recordings of 2004.<BR>Not only is Arcade Fires \\"Funeral\\" a genre defying masterpiece, its also pleasing on every level to see a band push aside boundaries and do the impossible, write a totally original album ! <br />Eerie vocals, tinkering bells and whimsical sound effects make for a beautiful and haunting album from start to end.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|As a very demanding TV viewer, or at least one who tells the truth about what she likes and why..this program is a 10.  I have been enthralled since the first shouting sequence in which <br />Ephram tells his father, he wishes he (his dad) had died, instead of his mother. I haven't always known why I liked this series so much, but at this moment I recognize how refreshing it is to see MALES as children, adolescents and adults; depicted as vulnerable,heroic,bumbling,brilliant,generous,selfish,talented, <br />angry,funny,loving,and romantic; but usually well intentioned and willing to learn and change from their experiences. <br />I have recommended this \\"season\\" to a friend/surgeon for levity and learning in relation to his practice/co-workers, his wife, his children and his ever-inspiring search for who he is...For that matter, I recommend it to everyone bravely on this same path for him/herself.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I bought this the day it came out as I counldn't wait to hear the unreleased tracks. I was dying to hear Sunset Driver and the P.Y.T. demo. I was NOT dissapointed at all. Sunset Driver is an excellent song. I think it was meant to be put on Off The Wall but the booklet says it was recorded for Thriller. Anyways, I dont know why the song was never put on an album, maybe Michael was just being too picky. Other notable songs on disc one are \\"You Can't Win\\". I was glad to hear they had the long version with \\"Can't Get Outta The Rain\\" on it. The \\"Shake Your Body\\" demo is very similar to the final cut version. Disc two has the demo of \\"P.Y.T\\". I was looking forward to hear. It is mid-tempo, I guess Quincy Jones wanted something faster for the album. I really like this demo a lot. It is very catchy for a demo. As far as the rest of the boxed set, all the hits are there. My only complaints are that \\"Human Nature\\" wasn't put on. And as for unreleased tracks, where is \\"Hot Street\\"? Put Hot Street and Sunset Driver on the cd and you got two excellent unreleased dance tracks. \\"Carousel\\" is also another track from thriller that is very good but was unreleased. Wish that was on there as well. The dvd concert is good but I would rather see a concert from the \\"Victory Tour\\" in 1984 or even the \\"Bad Tour\\". The unreleased material on disc's 3 and 4 are O-kay. I just feel that MJ's best music was from Off The Wall and the Thriller era so I just wanted to hear as much from that era than anything else. This boxed set is definitely worth the money.
B000002MTR|3.0|Well kids, deal with it, there's no John Frusciante on this album.  Alright, now get over your cying, I know I know, I cried too and just listen to this album for the bridge it is between BSSM and Californication.  The basic problem with the album is that just over half of it contains good music.  Then you get slapped with about 4 songs that are simply complete crap.  To all you people who say that Walkabout and Transcending are good, I dare you to point on one singular stand out moment in the songs that makes them remotely interesting to listen to.  Don't worry,  Read on for My Review...........    1.Warped-This is some really warped stuff.  It's a real interesting take on a song that is structurally like everything the Chilis had done until that point except for the crazy synthesized delayed vocals of Anthony Kiedis.  At first glance you might look down on it with dismay but you will most likely learn to love this bit of musical fusion between Dave Navarro and the Chilis.  2.Aeroplane-Probably the most well known song on this album outside of My Friends.  It sticks to what was then a newer Chili Peppers format of funky slap bass filled verses and softer choruses.  The chorus will stick in your head for ages.  Nice outro wahwah induced solo by Dave at the end of the song.  3.Deep Kick-This song is quite interesting with its funky retrospective groove mixed with a minute and a half spoken word intro.  The acoustic guitar mixed with the electric guitar in the verses works well.  I especially like the vocal time Flea gets on the outro.  4.My Friends-Best song on the album.  This song works on every level.  It is most definitely the best song the Chilis did with Dave Navarro.  The acoustic guitar works really well with the heartfelt lyrics about loss (does anyone else see this song as being about John Frusciante?)  and great electric guitar in the bridge that does its part without being overwhelming.  5.Coffee Shop-Funk metal anyone??  Interesting song with odd lyricsand some seriously funky ass slap bass.  The best parts of the song are the bridge where Flea gets to let go with a synthesizer/wahwah effect over his bass and some rocking soloing work by Flea in the outro.  He is truly a God and possibly the best bass player of all time.  6.Pea-Flea's other vocal moment on the album.  It's just him on vocals and bass with no other accompaniment.  The lyrics are utterly random and quite odd but the song still has a great laugh factor.  7.One Big Mob-Interesting song in terms of structure.  It has the odd effect of rocking you hard at the beginning, softening up for a rrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy long time (so much so that you occasionally will want it to end) and then speeds back up.  Still it's a cool song to listen to and has Dave's daughter Gabriel crying at some point in the song.  8.Walkabout-Holds down a steady beat of bass and drums but is an overall boring song.  Dave Navarro just doesn't sound comfortable playing anything near straight funk and his solo's kinda annoying.  Decent song though.  9.Tearjerker-This is a cute little ditty inspired by Kurt Cobain's suicide.  It's a rather moving song and the subliminal orchestra lurking in the backround only improves it.  It truly has the capacity to make you cry if it hits you just the way its supposed to.  Cool solo too.  10.One Hot Minute-This song presents the Chili Peppers really picking it back up the record.  This song is full of passion and rocks you hard for six whole minutes and only letts up in the bridge.  The whole band seems to really gell on this track which is a real standout for this reviewer.  One of the heaviest and 4th best song on the album.  11.Falling Into Grace-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Excesive use of Talkbox during the verses.  12.Shallow Be Thy Game-Funky wahwah intro by Flea.  This song is good ole fashioned funky with a real heavy edge.  Song is real powerful and is a good follow up to Falling Into Grace which justblows.  Nice Funky solo by Dave.  13.Transcending-Boring ending.  This killed the record for me.  If you want any real obvious reason for three stars it is this piece of complete and utter trash.  They shoulda just ended the record with Shallow Be Thy Game.    Overalll, buy this album and try to just deny the existence of tracks like Transcending.  The lack of John Frusciante is sometimes negative but Dave Navarro does overall provide himself as being a good stand in for the mid nineties period.  Just go out and buy this record immediately.
B0002Z1EG2|2.0|Shania has really fallen off. All her songs sound the same because she rely on her husband to make her sounds, while she continues to write only cookie cutter songs. The new songs and the UP! songs are not exciting at all and shows that while the world contines to turn and change, Shania and Mutt has not. I was even surprise to see that despite this being a greatest hits cd, there was no write-up from someone on her amazing career. No write-up on how she changed country music. I loved \\"The Woman In Me\\" and \\"Come On Over\\" because she was hungry, but now it appears that she is only going through the motions. Sad...she could have been the Dolly Parton of her generation.
B0006284JQ|4.0|*sigh* What can I say about Miss Spears that hasn't been said? Well, we all know she is not a great vocal talent, but I can't knock her off too hard. I admire her for taking risks and trying new things and this is what her greatest hits cd shows. In past reviews, I have been hard on Britney's past efforts (even though I liked her \\"In The Zone\\" cd). But as I was driving in my car, listening to this cd I had to admit that her music made me sing and tap my feet. If anything, Britney smartly surrounded herself with amazing producers who knew how to work her voice with their sounds and they did a great job and she did a great job with the presentation of it. Even though I think a greatest hits cd from Britney is premature, I hope she uses her time off to GROW as an artist. Take some voice lessons and learn how to play an instrument. If she doesn't, its the end of her career.
B0000085N4|5.0|I'm not real clear on my memory of how I got into The Cult, I think it was because I saw them with pics of one of my favorite pro wrestlers way back when and it made me think hey, must be a good band! I had heard \\"Bad Fun\\" (which is on their album \\"Electric\\") from a video game and thought it was one of the coolest songs ever. I started listening to a few of their songs that I could find, and they all rocked hard. The first song that really got me into them, the song that started it all for me, was the second track on this record: \\"Fire Woman\\". Eventually I decided it was time to buy a record. Reading reviews from this site, I decided \\"Sonic Temple\\" would be a good place to start. <br /> <br />This album blows my mind. I already knew the opening track \\"Sun King\\", the uplifting \\"Fire Woman\\", and the soulful \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\". What I discovered after playing this album through a few times was that every song on here is rock solid. The Cult is a band that writes some of the most engaging music I've ever heard, and for me, that's saying a lot. Two songs on here that really stand out to me are \\"New York City\\", which rocks with soul and passion, and \\"Soldier Blue\\", which has a tune that draws you in and makes you want to sing along. Ian Astbury sings with his heart, which is in the music, and I love his voice in general. Billy Duffy is an outstanding guitarist, whose chalant charismatic playing will appeal to many. This is by far one of rock's finest moments, and the music is so much better than a lot of the stuff that's out there. This album is for everyone.
B0002S94OS|5.0|\\"As The Palaces Burn\\" was a hugely successful album. \\"Ruin\\" and \\"11th Hour\\" were all over Uranium and Headbangers ball, and they even got some late night radio play. But all of this attention and popularity begs the question: would they continue with their heavy and relentless sound, or turn to mush to appeal to the mainstream? The opening track and first single \\"Laid To Rest\\" answers that question right away. This is a very heavy song, scorching vocals, good guitar and drums, and an awesome breakdown right in the middle. From there, the album never slows down.  <br /> <br />The vocals have improved in my opinion. On As The Palaces Burn Randy Blythe usually used his deep throaty growl, but on this album he does his low death metal growling and high screeching more often, and they all sound great. The guitar and drums are just as good as they have ever been. The lyrics are also very good, Lamb Of God turned to politics in writing this album.  <br /> <br />The only thing that is better about As The Palaces Burn are the breakdowns. While most of As The Palaces Burns breakdowns were Slayer rip-offs, I miss them all the same. But other than that, this album is just as good as A.T.P.B and should not disappoint any Lamb Of God fan. They havent sold out one bit.
B0001Z363W|5.0|It's funny, I got into Zakk after seeing his cameo on Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  I was into metal on a sort of guilty pleasure basis back in the 80's and I remember hearing No Rest For The Wicked and thinking he was just another generic shredder. <br /> <br />But I was in the mood for some old school metal so I bought 1919 and Blessed Hellride and was completely blown away.  The guy can write, he can sing, he can play the hell out a Les Paul.  If you're into heavy music these are must-own CDs in my book. <br /> <br />And now this record.  It's got incredibly shredding guitar solos, but the overall vibe is a little mellower, a little more melancholy and introspective.  The instrumentation is more diverse with acoustic guitar and piano thrown into the mix, and the songwriting is better than ever. <br /> <br />So that's what's funny to me: the shred kid from New Jersey turns out to have the soul of an artist.   <br /> <br />Lots of \\"hardcore\\" types will probably diss this album for being a little soft, and the mainstream audience is unlikely to be exposed to it at all.  Too bad.  This is great music.  If you have (in the words of the late great Mr. Hendrix) any kind of heart and ears, buy this record.  You won't regret it. <br /> <br />One of the best releases of 2004.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I was a huge fan of \\"Before Sunrise\\" and was a bit apprehensive when I heard a sequel was in the works. That perfect night between Jessie and Celine was, in my opinion, the epitomy of what makes being young and in love wonderful.  You meet a person who is unlike everything you are yet simultaneously like everything you want and you spend hours talking.  Before the relationship can sour or a real disagreement can develop, goodbye is said and both parties move on.<br /><br />What happens though when the parties don't exactly follow the above? When they both realize that a perfect connection was the true connection - love - and that it was a lost opportunity?  Well, if you're lucky (as Jessie) was, you write a book, get to go to Paris, find the girl and make it right.<br /><br />Many fans commented that this movie's ending was ambigious, but it you look at the subtext it wasn't at all.  The ending was playing on Celine's stereo, hummed by her and sung by the marvelous Nina Simone.  Baby, he missed that plane.
B0002858YS|4.0|Trying to establish yourself as a band in today's rock world isn't what it used to be. First of all you don't have the element of surprise as mostly everything that could possibly be done -musically- in this genre has probably been done. Secondly, guitar heroics alone, might carry you some of the way but they will hardly save you. <br /> <br />    Facing this the Killers went -and i dont mean necessarily with intention- the only way which could show them some kinda light at the end of the tunnel, namely incorporating modern electronic elements in their music and blending them masterfully with well crafted guitar work and cool vocals. <br /> <br />    So where do the 80s come in? Well, anyone over the age of 30 will easily hear the gel-decade through almost each song of the Killers. Not in a way that could make you go \\"ugh, it's the fr****n 80s\\" but in a way where some of the better electronic moments from that bygone time resurface. <br /> <br />    To be more precise, it's the synthies that make the Killers stand out from the pack. This by no means implies that the rest of their music suffers but it does mean that without their synthie references to a specific time this band would simply line up hopelessly with the rest of them hoping for some limelight. <br /> <br />   The Killer's music is one of definite pop orientations, but that's maybe where the surprise element does exist, in that, this is intelligent, well-constructed pop that doesnt insult your mind and ears. It's also good ole rock of course, but it's not intended for the smokey underground bars where most rock bands find their heaven but instead for a large, a quite large, audience. <br /> <br />   Then the songs themselves have this \\"annoying\\" quality of being catchy upon the first listen. Even to the more difficult to please listeners. In contrast to bands like Franz Ferdinard or the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (and many other current bidders) you dont have to convince yourself to like the Killers. Nordo you need fall victim to some kinda overworked hype.It's a process that will happen almost instantly, breezily, effortlessly i would say. <br />   Liking this band wont count on your record as a crime.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This DVD is what qualty production is about. Every detail from the menus to the camera work are exceptional. The scope and breath of whats here covers every era of  blues, mixed with a bit of rock and some country. Thats Just DVD Disc 1. The second disc gets into some more interesting fringe music like John McLaughin, Rag Bihag, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson. Then it continues on the rock theme with Joe Walsh, more Clapton and a smattering of Robert Cray and ZZ Top. The sound is top notch, every note, vocal and seperation of musicians is perfect. This is a top quality production, every DVD show should sound like it. The interviews are interesting also, along with a nice photo gallery. I could not recommend this disc more, to anyone who enjoys blues rock or music in general. BUY IT NOW! You won't be disappointed. Most DVD productions could learn a lot from this DVD.
0345308239|5.0|Barbara Tuchman's The March of Folly certainly is an interesting and informative book. I give this excellent book 5 stars even though there are a few concerns I had on a few of her assertions and a wish for more detail in other areas. <br /> <br />One strength of the book is Tuchman's effort to define \\"folly\\" with a strict criteria and then compare events from history to that criteria. Basically she defines \\"folly\\" as the pursuit of policy against self-interest in the face of evidence contradicting the wisdom of the policy. Further, the \\"folly\\" must be counter-productive and the decision of a group rather than an individual. The \\"folly\\" must continue despite dissenting voices and articulated options or alternatives. <br /> <br />The chapters on the Renaissance Popes was very entertaining and decadent. Tuchman takes the reader through the papacy of Sixtus IV (from the powerful della Rovera family)who expanded the college of Cardinals to meet his policitical ends; Innocent VII who indulged his son and promoted the rise of the Borgia and Di Medici families in the papal court; Alexander VI who would have to be considered as the worst pope in history due to his total conversion of his religious office into a secular worldly power; Julius II (another della Rovera) who was a warrior pope and the patron of Michaelangelo; Leo X (a di Medici) who used the papacy for indulgence and gain of his Florentine family; and Clement VII who became the virtual prisoner of Emperor Charles V after the invasion and conquest of Rome.  <br /> <br />The story of these 6 popes is a wild tale full of murder, treachery, theft, bribery, sexual depravity, and power politics. In short, the Papacy had become a secular state during this period and Realpolitic was the driving philosophy rather than a church concerned with Christianity. Tuchman indicates that a rising voice of discontent was developing, which erupts with the resistance of Martin Luther in protest against the sale of indulgences. It ison this point that I wish Tuchman had written more. The development of resistance and rebellion against Catholicism needed more explanation and historic development to parallel the decadence and worldly pursuits of the papacy. These six popes seemed insulated to the point that only secular power politics and self aggrandizement were within their range of concerns and actions. Whereas as a group they certainly practiced \\"folly\\" in terms of the credibility of the Catholic church, they each pursued rational behaviors if survival in a world of warring states and gain from office are seen as the overiding concerns of these 6 men. The Catholic papacy had drifted away from it's Christian mission and taken on new missions more realistic for a secular state. Thus the \\"folly\\" was embedded in organizational drift. <br /> <br />The chapters on the loss of the American colonies by the British better fit Tuchman's thesis on the nature of \\"folly\\". In these chapters miscalculations, pride, and minimization of dissenting information and voices certainly led to a break between Britian and the Colonies that was initially desired by neither party. <br /> <br />The chapters on the war in Vietnam certainly document the gradual fall into this crisis over the Presidencies of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. Tuchman does a good job of explaining how the French had practiced unfair dominance on their Vietnam colony, setting the stage for rebellion against western domination; how DeGaul pressured the United States to support the French in Vietnam in return for France's participation in NATO; how the United States interpreted interactions in Vietnam through the prism of the Cold War as compared to the Vietnamese who saw the conflict as a war of independence.  <br /> <br />After reading all the wonderful examples given by Tuchman; what is the answer as to how to avoid \\"folly\\"?  Tuchman sees pursuit of power as a force that sets the stage for folly. Power means that the interestsof one group is advanced over the interest of another creating a competitive dichotomy of concerns and interests. Tuchman also sees vested interests contrary to the larger principles as a force that initiates \\"folly\\". Personal incompetence in persons with power allows mission drift and creates the furtile soil on which others can play for personal gain rather than collective gain. Excessive power frequently leads to disorder and injustice in many cases but a powerful central force that maintains mission goals over personal gain would also seem to be necessary. Conceptual stagnation when mental flexibility is needed also leads to \\"folly\\", primarily because adaptive leadership to new and changing conditions is absent. Tuchman gives examples of situations where policy is based on outdated principles and that when contrary information arises, the policy becomes more rigid rather than more flexible. Error is to be expected. Persistence in error is the path to \\"folly\\".
B00005NTN5|5.0|I actualy saw this movie way before the matrix. The first time I saw it, it blew me away.A lot of the camera angles and tricks in the matrix started in this movie. There are also scenes with the same phone you see in the matrix movies which resemble scenes out of those movies. The story is awesome!!. Twists and turns and you don't know who to trust. A must see!!!

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Now im a massive MJ fan but even the craziest fan will be stupid not to see that this box set is just taking advantage of MJ's huge fanbase to make money.  That said i taped the concert in the uk and my copy got lost so im more then willing to pay the 30 pounds to get it.  whether guilty or not MJ pioneered music in so many forms and deserves respect.  I know because if him we have scmucks like Justin Timberlake and Britney spears, but we also got Usher, Alicia Keys, even the Rap industry grew due to him breaking bariers.  He is a legend.
0802130208|3.0|According to a quote in the beginning of the book by Jonathan Swift, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.  It is pretty obvious that this quote directly is included to directly pertain to Ignatius, the main character of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.  Ignatius J. Reilly is no doubt a genius, but I was never able to wholeheartedly view him as such, for he always acts foolish.  For instance, when Mr. Gonzalez tries to help Ignatius sit up after Ignatius falls from a stool, Ignatius coldly replies, \\"No! You must never move a person with a broken back unless you have a stretcher\\" (84).  Yet, a few moments later, when Miss Trixie accidentally steps on Ignatius's hand, he \\"thundered and sprang into a sitting position.  The bones in my hand are crushed.  I'll never be able to use it again (85).  Ignatius speaks intelligently, for he had eight years of college education; yet he uses his intelligence with the immaturity of a five-year-old.  This is the main reason I was sometimes frustrated while reading the novel.      It appears as if Ignatius is a character created for the purpose of contradicting the old saying, \\"Two wrongs don't make a right.\\"  While working for Levy Pants, Ignatius naughtily replaces Mr. Gonzalezs letter to a recipient company with his own letter.  The contents of this letter are so offensive that that recipient company decides to sue Levy Pants for $500,000.  This obviously creates a major complication for Levy Pants, more specifically for its owner, Gus Levy.  Through his wit, Ignatius ultimately \\"saved himself, Miss Trixie, and Mr. Levy, too, in his own kook way\\" (377).      What makes this story extremely interesting is how Ignatius's life seems to have fallen off a cliff.  The story continuously leaves the reader anxious to find out when he will hit the ground or if, during his plunge to death, he will suddenly sprout wings and save himself.  The significance of the Night of Joy bar in relation to the story is only understood at the end of the book when Ignatius lies lifelessly on the street in front of the Night of Joy bar.  Throughout the story, Ignatius starts with a very respectable job at Levy Pants, then gets fired and lands in a job pushing a weenie wagon, and ultimately ends up at the foot of the Night of Joy bar, a disgraceful and unpopular bar whose owner is affiliated with pornography.  Just when I thought that was the end of the road for Ignatius and that the remainder of the story would describe the consequences of his mischievous actions, Toole shocks me and somehow vindicates Ignatius from all of his wrongdoings.    A Confederacy of Dunces is an extremely interesting story that justifiably won the Pulitzer Prize.  Though irksome at times, Ignatius's pompous attitude succeeds in making the reader laugh.  Oh, I forgot to mention the funniest part of this book - Ignatius is an obscenely obese man who wants to change the world back to how it was in the Middle Ages; this makes for a very interesting read, guaranteed.  But I advise you to keep some Big Chief tablets handy for your pyloric valve might close at times.    Now I must return to my homeland, India, and suffer until the British confederacy of dunces realizes that Im truly a genius :).
B00028HBKC|5.0|There are several reasons why I wanted to see this movie in the theatre and why I got the DVD when it first came out. Here are the most important reasons...    Firstly, I read somewhere about a saint (could be the Fatima Saint Lucia Santos) saying that Christ was upset over the fact that no one on Earth reads his passion and death in the Gospels anymore--or atleast the majority of people on Earth don't pay great deal of attention to it.  So I kind of believe that Jesus had a hand in making this film--no matter if Mel Gibson knew about it or not.    Secondly, I think I've read somewhere that Mel Gibson thought depressing thoughts during the time that he was making Braveheart (or atleast before or after that time), and that the only thing that got him through life was reading the passion of Jesus.    Thirdly, there is supposed to be a town in Germany that, during the middle ages, was almost on the verge of contracting the plague, but the residents of this town decided to ask God to not allow the plague to come to them if they decided to put on the play of his son's passion and death from then onwards.  I think they are still putting on this play to this day, and the plague never came to their town.    This movie is great.  It had everything that I expected from a clean cut movie depicting the brutality that the enemies of Christ inflicted upon Christ himself.  It shows how much Christ loved the Universe by sacrificing himself for all of us.  This movie shows a perfect dignity and respect to Jesus and his Apostles, unlike the perfomances shown in the movie: Jesus of Nazareth--although this last movie made in the late '70s is not so bad either.  Three cheers for the Father,  the Son, and the Holy Spirit and congratulations to Mel Gibson and Jim Caviezel !!!
B00005JLK1|2.0|Ghost Ship starts well. The opening sequence lets the audience know why the Andrea Graza was lost, the horrible thing that was done to the passengers and why our heroes really ought to leave this salvage operation alone. Then it gets a little sloppy.     The makers of this movie weren't too creative and borrowed heavily from other movies. The ballroom scene with Isaiah Washington echoes the bathroom scene from The Shinning. Katie ghost wears a dress, hairstyle and sounds like the twins from the Shinning. When Gabrile Byrne (who looks for all the world like he's embarassed to even be in this flick)has  his drink that too is very reminiscent of any of the bar scenes from Shinning. His reaction and fate is very much like a couple of scenes from The Thing. Julianna Margulies seems to be imitating Ripley from Aliens and the villian seems to have wandered in from Dark Knight.      One thing really irked me. What was that hideous rock soundtrack all about? Why play hard rock for the flashback 1960s scenes? The movie is not horrible but it's not scary or very interesting. I give it a C+ because it's kind of amusing figuring out which movie a particular scene was stolen from but if you aren't a movie triva or nitpicker Ghost Ship won't entertain you.
B000002LEM|2.0|OU812 seemingly a jab at David Lee Roth's Eat 'em and Smile\\" album lives and dies with Sammy Hagar. Now with Ed Van Halen firmly in control of the band and its image and, most importantly, the frontman, Van Halen soldiers on now mining the same genre that Sammy Hagar had mined years before, the \\"I'm a partying sex toy, but I'm also a serious musician\\" genre. Much of it doesn't work at all. The best track is the one I cringe at most when I hear it, \\"Whenit's love\\"....a \\"love walks in re-make\\", the STYXish syrupy ballad complete with Hagar's teenage lyrics.  The clean picking Ed does on \\"Finish..\\" is definately fresh sounding, but onece again the insipid Lyrics of Hagar ruin this for any male music fan over the age on 16. Gone is Ted Templeman doing the producing chores and in is Don Landee. The sound is cleaner, more saturated than previous Van Halen, but classic VH is from the 1970s early 1980s and sound production values will change as decades pass. Hagar's strong pipes and a decent sense of melody is a far cry from Lee Roth's scat and wail crooning, but it's most certainly not an improvement in the end. However, In the end, Hagar's juvenile lyrics and his over the top delivery (re: all the \\"yeahs!\\" and \\"Heys\\", and \\"Come On!\\") really stall the mighty Van Halen instrumental engine. The songs come off as poor attempts at party music the band once knocked out at will in the studio and overall become entirely forgettable as years go by. If your a diehard Ed Van Halen afficianado you'll apreciate the good guitar. Everyone else should just ask for the check please.
B000001E7L|4.0|For a long time, To The Faithful Departed was the only Cranberries album I'd heard. Then after a few years I purchased all the other CDs. Cranberries seem to have this emotion attached to each song of theirs and whats beautifully amusing about them is that its different in each song. Well somehow or the other. They've made some very simple songs that seem to have haunted my memory for a long time and still are.<br /><br />\\"Ode To My Family\\" seems to create a spark which seems to get lost somewhere in the song.\\"I cant be with you\\" is a great emotion ariser.\\"Zombie\\" is a headbanger and probably one of the catchiest tunes you'll hear.I heard this song on some compilation of songs and Im still hooked.Its the kind of a song that people mention when I mention the name of Cranberries.Its great all the same.Has to be in my top 10 Cranberries songs.<br /><br />\\"Everything I said\\" is a typical Cranberries track. It tends to stay in your head when your doing something else. What follows next is probably the best song on the album , \\"Ridiculous THoughts\\"and all I can do is try to use the best of my comprehension abilities to describe what this song can do and does in each listen. This song brings a smile on my face which is neither sympathetic nor anticipated. What RT manages to do is mesmerise me and take my hand to lead to a place where its just Dolores O' Riordan and her voice that holds me. Its something I won't ever burn for anyone cause I have a sense of belong attached to it. Its uplifting and by the end of the song I feel eternal.<br /><br />Dreaming My Dreams is just beautiful.I picturise a bench in a garden and the sunshining each time I hear it. No Emotion can be this well interlaced in a song. \\"Daffodil Lament\\" is the one of the strongest Cranberries songs.It has a bit of \\"Electric Blue\\" in it which also happens to be my favourite Cranberries songs. Its like dancing around a fire and enjoying it cause you've lost the feeling of feeling.<br /><br />\\"No Need To Argue\\" Track 13 is kind of a submission without a contract that probably says it all without much emphasis.<br /><br />The album is somehow incomplete which is why I give it 4 stars. I think To The Faithful Departed is Cranberries next album but its another book of sorrow and pleasure combined with agony itself.Till Next Time.<br /><br />Love And Cranberries,<br /><br />KTo Argue\\" Track 13 is kind of a submission without a contract that probably says it all without much emphasis. <br /> <br />The album is somehow incomplete which is why I give it 4 stars.

B00004Y6O7|4.0|Van Halen's party-hardy with her [...] around her ankles theme took a sharp turn toward the dark side with the release of Fair Warning in '81. Partly because the band was beginning to age a bit, but mostly due to the fact that David Lee Roth's lyrics were being shaped by recent holiday trips to Haiti (of all Places). The realization came to Roth after finnally seeing that Haiti was not really a place of merriment for rich rock stars looking to party all over the world. Thus we see the change to darker, more frank lyrics (Mean Streets, Unchained). There is a bit of the ol' Diamond Dave represented here (Sinner's Swing, One foot out the Door) but the dark edges never quiet leave the entire collections of tunes. Ed Van Halen's then latest collection of authentic riffs give the album the toughness needed for the darker side, his sense of humor in his style being put aside for a more gritty, and dense playing. Fair Warning should have been a cross-roads for the band to progress into a more mature adult-oriented rock and roll band, but time shows it as the beginning of the end of the \\"Classic\\" Van Halen lineup, which preceeded the melancholy Sammy Hagar era. Fair Warning stands on its own merits as a classic Van Halen offering, it stands toe to toe with any other effort from the band. It seems that the direction the band took for Fair Warning could have moved them into the direction of such \\"serious\\" bands such as The Who or Led Zeppelin as their careers progressed, and would have allowed them to leave the \\"party band\\" image that Ed Van Halen is so intent of shedding nowadays. But it's all ancient history today.
0316236446|5.0|When my son turned four, he started making pictures with a pen.  He showed no particular talent, but his chicken scratches sometimes looked cute.  That's when I did a search on Amazon looking for children drawing instruction books.  The Ed Emberley's series popped up, and I picked Make a World in addition to 3 others.<br /><br />At first my child just looked at the books and smiled, so I started him out by drawing a blimp myself, showing him how to follow each step in the book.  After he watched me do it, he also drew a blimp, following the simple picture instructions nicely (he couldn't read at all.)  I then showed both blimps to my husband; he said he couldn't tell the difference.  I couldn't either.<br /><br />From that day on, my son spent 4, 5 HOURS per day with Make a World and drew various things in the book.  With no encouragement from me!  My mother was impressed, because my son is normally a hyperactive monkey that you can't tie down!  Some of the instructions are very small, but he doesn't seem to have any trouble.  The book lasted him months.  If nothing else, it was a wonderful babysitter!<br /><br />I showed some of his pictures to my friends; all were impressed that a four-year-old can draw such detailed, complex pictures.  The trick is showing him how.<br /><br />I am a math teacher and I don't care for art normally.  However, I believe that drawing everyday objects at a younger age will help a child's spatial conception, which will be beneficial later towards learning geometry and trigonometry.  That's just my opinion.<br /><br />If you only want to get one Ed Emberley book, get this one because it has everything. (though the others are great too!)
B000002N25|4.0|MKs first solo effort is uncompromising, but as comfortable as a good pair of slippers. Not drawing as much of his Nashville influence as on his latter solo projects, Golden Heart sound more Dire Straitish than one might think, after all he WAS Dire Straits. \\"Darling Pretty\\" and \\"Golden Heart\\" are as gorgous as anything MK has ever written and \\"Don't You Get It\\" is as laid-back-in -the-pocket-groove as only MK can write.  Overall a slower paced album than most Dire Straits records, with the exception of the cute \\"Cannibals\\" with a two-step beat and honkin accordian zydeco sound, Golden Heart will give Dire Strait lovers their fix, moreso than the next two MK releases, but that's another review.

Paul Anka knew what he was doing when he discovered Michael, because he has a voice that is only his and can't be matched.  If you know good music and can recognize a good voice when you hear it, then you know that Michael's voice can't be matched, he knows what music is all about and has the passion for music that is needed.  This kind of passion for music is what is needed today.  Michael's career will go far. <br /> <br />Another Music Lover <br /> <br />
B000002LPD|2.0|For Unlawful....is more of the same from the Van Halen/Sammy Hagr duo. Eddie trying to write the perfect radio friendly song with Sammy Hagar adding another collection of goofy machissimo lyrics. The effort opens up with \\"Poundcake\\", a basically riffless song with Hagar supplying an ample amount of junior-high lockeroom lingo lyrics. The albums high point commercially was \\"Right Now\\" complete with a very un-Van Halen-like contemporary smooth jazz piano offered up by Ed much to the delight of soft-rockers everywhere. The video makes the song seem much better than it really is, and that in itself is very un-Van Halen-like. Overall the songs rank as poor as any in the post Lee Roth era where melancholy rules the day. Commercially a high point for the band as they make new fans in the early 1990s, but artistically a low point as per usual with anything Sammy Hagar touches. Skip it.

B0002SROT0|5.0|To simply put it, this album is amazing. Every song on here is a masterpiece in it's own right. I have never been able to listen to an album several times throughout the day (without skipping a song nonetheless) until now. Do not listen to anyone who says some songs are leftovers, it's simply not true. Songs like \\"Shooting Star\\" are not sloppily written simply because they involve crunchy electric guitar--it's just the direction Elliott Smith was headed in as you can see from his albums because each one changes a bit. This is right up there next to Nirvana's Nevermind as my favorite album. I can't believe the album hasn't gotten boring yet after listening to it through so many times (not counting the time I just play certain songs on my itunes). His guitar rythem is so catchy on this album and his voice has improved with his own backup singing (Twilight highlights this). Trust me, buy this album now and you will love it. It is a fitting end for Elliott Smith and has diminished any doubt that the album might not be a good last album.

Imagine, a Disney movie not about love and not set in America. I recommend it if you're looking for a good movie for family night. And an ANSWER to the review who asked what the translation in chinese is for little brother, in Manderin, I believe it is didi [pronounced deedee].
B000001DZQ|5.0|Very nice collection put together by Polygram who got permission to include some of his work from Atlantic Records as well. Of the 26 songs, 9 were previously unreleased. Interestingly, the first four were from his psychedelic days when his lead singer was Charlie Daniels. Just an amazing guitarist who should be rated on the same level as SRV, Clapton, Page, Hendrix and so on. Some astounding covers of Down By The River, If Six Were Nine, Green Onions, Hey Joe, and Turn To Stone but the original stuff is just as good if not better, especially The Messiah Will Come Again which I used to always hear late at night on WBCN. The liner notes tell the made for \\"Behind The Music\\" story of the reluctant guitar god whose life came to a tragic end. RIP
B000066NW0|1.0|This is probably the worst CD I've ever heard.  Avril Lavigne could have sounded better if she was playing with kazoos and aluminum pie plates as opposed to musical instruments. <br /> <br />I can't think of a single artist who is worse than Avril Lavigne.  If you want to annoy yourself, than just listen to this CD.  It is annoying and repetitive.  The songs sound so similar that you can't tell them apart.  Every song is just a whiney teenager complaining about how miserable her life is, while a bunch of flat, dull, acoustic guitars twang and jangle away in the background.   <br /> <br />This is manufactured \\"complaint rock\\" tailor made by a record company to fit into whatever is trendy today.  Avril Lavigne was manufactured to take advantage of the pop-punk trend.  She dresses up in a tomboy outfit.  She rides a skateboard.  She wears a tie.  If you can't see how obviously manufactured she is, then you are just stupid.  Anybody with a brain should realise that this is a carefully marketed product designed to exploit a fad, and separate a bunch of gullable immature fools from their money.   <br /> <br />I know that all you Avril fans get your 12 year old feelings hurt when someone insults your idol, but trust me, someday you'll be sorry you were ever a fan of Avril Lavigne.  Someday you'll throw away your tomboy outfits, and sell your skateboards.  You'll realise that Avril is a fraud, and you'll hate yourself for being so naive.  The same thing happened to me with Nirvana.  I turned against them a few years ago when I realised how fake they are.   <br /> <br />In a few years, Avril Lavigne will have a new job as a real estate agent, and nobody will like her music anymore.  \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" will vanish from radio station playlists.  Hot Topic will go out of buisiness.  Sales of ties and tomboy clothes will drop by 95%.  Don't worry people.  Musical trends die out quick.  There IS a future without Avril Lavigne.  As soon as her fanbase graduates frommiddle school, she'll be gone.

If so why did they desert us?<br /><br />Forty some years ago author Erich von Daniken laid out his case that many ancient construction feats that surpassed the technology of the alleged builders were actually accomplished by on in conjunction with ancient astronauts, people who may have been our ancestors.<br /><br />Von Daniken lays out a very persuasive theory as he addresses unexplained phenomena around the world postulating that these mysteries can only be explained by assistance from a superior civilization.<br /><br />To make his case von Daniken takes us to Mexico, South America, Easter Island, North America and of course Egypt.<br /><br />Von Daniken's heretical hypothesis may be true or it may be  erroneous but it does offer an explanation for many mysteries of antiquity and either way it makes those with an open mind, think.
B000669GAI|5.0|Being a huge Pearl Jam fan, this CD offers no new songs (I already had all of them), but it does offers a great way of organizing some of Pearl Jam's best songs. CD #1 offers the more up-beat songs (Alive, Rearviewmirror, Not for You), while #2 is slower (Yellow Ledbetter, Last Song, Black, Elderly woman...) If you're a casual fan, or new to the group, this CD offers you a good glimpse of the group. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys a good Rock group.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|The concept of an album specifically designed to please mothers and those soon to be doesn't sound like it would be even noticeable in the music marketplace, does it? Indeed, it probably wouldn't be in the hands of most singers, but apparently it is when wrapped in the voice of Celine Dion, the best-selling female singer of our time. It is most certain that such a sales-be-dammed album could only debuting in the Top 5 of the album chart is remarkable. Even more remarkable still is its continued respectable success.<br /><br />Although anyone who knows just how talented a chanteuse Dion is should not be too surprised, it is nonetheless unexpected that the album actually has the ability to appeal to anyone who appreciates lush, lovely ballads. A collaboration between herself and celebrated photographer Anne Geddes, previously known for her dexterity in capturing the beauty of newborns in pictures, the \\"Miracle\\" project is available as a single CD with a handful of Geddes' images of Dion with babies interspersed throughout the artwork, and a deluxe edition with a 180 page book filled with Geddes' images, the album, and a special `making-of' DVD documenting the project.<br /><br />The opening and title track is a seamless track that is truly tailor-made for Dion. Written by Steve Dorff and Linda Thompson, it is indescribably beautiful and the epitome of what the project is all about.<br /><br />\\"I'm overwhelmed with happiness/So blessed to hold you close/The one that I love most/Though the future has so much for you in store/Who could ever love you more?\\"<br /><br />Although she has doubtless annoyed some listeners by borrowing her interpretations of \\"Brahm's Lullaby\\" from 1998's seasonal disc \\"These Are Special Times\\" and \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" from 1999's \\"All the Way: A Decade of Song,\\" both fit the scheme of the collection ideally. Still, it is frustrating that \\"All Because of You,\\" a leftover from her 2002 comeback album \\"A New Day Has Come,\\" wasn't included. Released on CD as only a B-side overseas, the song not only has radio potential but also should have been included on this project in the name of common sense.<br /><br />\\"There's nothing I wouldn't do for you/You're the answer I've been needing/Life has a whole new meaning now/All because of you.\\"<br /><br />Not to be missed is \\"Baby Close Your Eyes,\\" which she sings with an air of reality only a mother could. Likewise is her performance of Barbra Streisand's \\"If I Could.\\" Reaching the vocal stratospheres she is deservedly known for, Dion makes the song just as heart-tugging and inspired as she did on her recently released live album, rendering Streisand's interpretation deferior. Her laid-back take on John Lennon's classic \\"Beautiful Boy\\" also provides some ear candy and gives the disc a chance not to take itself so seriously.<br /><br />If you are a by-the-wind fan of Dion who listens for hits like \\"I'm Alive\\" or \\"That's the Way It Is,\\" then \\"Miracle\\" is not your cup of tea. However, if you fancy widescreen ballads and can appreciate the fact that Dion loves being a mother even more than she does being a singer, it certainly is.me,\\" wasn't included.

B0000035E7|4.0|Coming from a Die hard Nirvana fan, Bleach was my first Album back in 1990, before Nevermind came out.  My first thought was, \\"Eh, It's alright, talented musicians, but kinda one dimentional.\\"  Once Never mind and In Utero came out, I realized that these great musicians matured musically, and became more interested in Bleach because it marked a time when Kurt was trying to figure out himself and his sound.  I alook at Bleach as an experiment to future things to come.  The first 7 songs on the album are all good, the second half pretty much sounds the same and I usually skip over the tracks, except for Sifting.  I still think they should have put Pen Cap Chew and some other of their now rare songs on this album instead of Mr Mustache, Swap Meet and Big Cheese.  All in all, I enjoy this album because it marked the beginning of something to come that will change the face of Rock n Roll forever.
0670033693|5.0|What do Herman Melville, Cervantes, Zane Grey, Raymond Chandler and Cheyenne Chief Wooden Leg have in common? They would have loved this book. <br /> <br />With characters and a story that stay with you long after you put it down, this is an exceptional story told by an exceptional storyteller. A murder mystery unlike any I have ever read, The Cold Dish is as thought provoking as it is readable, as rich and beautiful as the Wyoming sky under which it is set. <br /> <br />In expertly weaving together threads of tragedy and revenge with the redeeming power of humor, integrity, and friendship, Mr. Johnson is an authentic voice. His gift for bringing to life the emptiness, majesty and struggle of the Western landscape and the people it forges has created characters and a friendship between Walt and Henry Standing Bear that will stay with you for a long time. <br /> <br />Complex issues of history, race, murder, and love against the backdrop of sagebrush and Western skies. Characters so real you wish you could talk to them. The Cold Dish is a powerful addition to the literary canon dealing with that hard but beautiful part of America we simply call the West. <br /> <br />Point blank: Mr. Johnson spins a great yarn. This is one book you will read again and again. Guaranteed.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|There's somethnig about Will Ferrell.  About the way a man nearly 40-years-old can display such a child-like innocense without it being cloying and condescending.  Don't get me wrong, there are points in this movie when it is so sickly sweet that you just have to roll your eyes.  But it has such a great message about Christmas, about family, about diversity, about what is really important in life that you can overlook the sickly sweet moments and enjoy the film.  Ferrell is at his best when he is playing these innocent misfits.  Best of all, this is a film the entire family can sit down and watch.  A few bad words may be in there, but they are so fleeting that I can't even remember what they were.  This is a very enjoyable holiday film with some great moments and a lot of child-like humor.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I'm giving this movie 1 star because Michael Moore presents this movie as fact. This it is not, Moore takes footage without the concent of the person hes interviewing on several occasions, and takes the footage out of context. A number of other things in the movie just arent true, and have been disproven by the 9/11 commission. Watch it if you want but do not take it all for fact, do your own research to form opinions on this country and administration. Dont take an extremists opinion
B0001I561E|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Now, let's face it, I'm 16 years old and my favorite movie is Aladdin.  I know it sounds kinda weird in a psycho-kind-of-way, but it true.  If you were wondering, my other favorite movies include Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail and About a Boy.  I'm not all that werid.   <br />I practically have the whole movie of Aladdin memorized, including Abu's non-sensical gibberish.  Every line should be treasured, because this movie is by far the best Disney movie.  Not to mention the voice of Aladdin is absolutley gorgeous. <br />Along with some of the best voce talents and jokes, this movie has some of the best songs ever too.  My personal favorite is One Jump Ahead, where all of Agrabah is trying to get Aladdin.  Along with One Jump Ahead are Whole New World, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali.  Wow.  With songs like that, why isn't Aladdin everyone's favorite movie? <br />So, if you want to take the advice of a 16 year old whose favorite movie is Aladdin, BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!
B00006D295|5.0|I really, really love this movie.  It's funny, the music is great, the acting was very good, and it was overall perfect.  I would recommend this movie, it's wonderful.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Forget what the last 2 reviewers have said about Slayer. They don't know anything about Slayer or real metal. In fact, they probably weren't even born when Slayer started out in 1983. Bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, etc, are not true metal bands. They are \\"Nu Metal\\" bands that were created by MTV, enough said.Okay, now that let's get back to Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\". This is one of the best Thrash Metal Albums ever released, period. Sure, it's a short album clocking in at 28 minutes, it's a fast album, the twin guitar attack by Kerry King and Jeff Hannemanhave to be heard to be believed. Tom Araya's vocalsare brutal and Dave Lombardo's drumming is awesome as well. If you're a fan of Slayer and Thrash Metal, this is the cd you need.
0679879269|5.0|I read the first book in this series when i was in sixth grade, and  finished the last one in Ninth Grade. I loved them then and loved them now (hell, i've read the whole trilogy four times). But recently i have gained a whole new appreciation for them. Having become enamoured in Nietzschian philosophy i have found numerous relations between the message in The Amber Spyglass and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Pullman's view of whats wrong with christianity is essentially the same as that presented in Zarathustra. Both present  the idea of living for a world that for all you know is not there as an effront to life itself and all it has to offer. These are the preachers of death. The depiction of the fallen angels as friends of wisdom is also a very Nietzschian idea.
B0006284JQ|4.0|Listen, I know Britney Spears \\"sucks\\".  She's not a great artist, or even a great performer/entertainer.  I also know this CD probably marks the end of her career - I find it hard to believe she'll ever be able to make a comeback if she really is taking a couple years off. <br /> <br />However, I'm a sucker for great pop songs and that's what these are.  You're buying this CD to listen to Max Martin, the Neptunes and Mutt Lange work their radio-friendly magic.   Catchy, infectuous, fun.  All the great Brit-Pop without the album fillers.  <br /> <br />If that's what you want (like I did), you won't be disappointed.  Although I admit - it's hard to look cool to the record store clerk while buying this CD.  Thank goodness Amazon maintains my privacy so no one need ever know my guility pleasure.
B0002234LS|2.0|Oh, my, my, my, my.  Johnny Depp in a quirky role.  Who would have guessed?  It is a shame to see good actors in a very predictable plot.  Not much suprise here.  In the first 10 minutes you will figure out this \\"gimmicky\\" movie.  I'm really tired of these gimmicky movies.  What ever happened to straight out suspense and drama, well written thrillers with tight direction?  This is slickly produced, looks real good.  Eye candy as it were.  Nothing much else, a real disappointment to say the least.  You'll get more suspense from a Pay-Less Shoe Store sale.
B00008J4P5|1.0|...of watching \\"Gilligan's Island\\" as a kid. Specifically, the episode where Gilligan's favorite British Invasion band, \\"The Mosquitos\\", wound up on the island, and the men put together a band to try to impress them. Trust me, this album doesn't sound any worse than the obvious result, but neither does it sound any better. Call me old-fashioned, but there's more to rock and roll than attitude; at a certain point, being able to play your instrument competently and sing in tune becomes important, and not much of that is in evidence here. Sort of like The Shaggs with slightly better musicianship, but without the charming innocence that redeemed them.
B0000640VO|1.0|It seems somehow fitting that I've finally watched Amelie this day in November 2004 as Christmas approaches. The sheen and gloss of lights and decorations, the smell of rank consumerism spread thickly, the glow of decorative lights over one of Toronto's many panhandlers as they ask for change... ahhhh, it's good to be alive when we have films such as this to keep us cheerful as half the world battles in conflict, battles itself or battles poverty and starvation. Visually it is glorious, imaginative camera shots, excellent direction and some beautiful locations used with the colours tearing out from the screen. Like a crme brulee however, the shell is easily cracked and the actual core lacks substance. The central character is retchingly cute, from the immovable hairstyle to her facial mannerisms. She makes Judy Garland in the Wizard of Oz look like Courtney Love and probably excretes lavender lavender. The scenes explaining her messed-up childhood are generally played for laughs, depriving the character of any sort of audience sympathy by the time she reaches young adulthood and a life of being a loner with an odd imagination. Kooky, strange, weird, she's all of that and more. Quite how she ended up with previous boyfriends is beyond me, perhaps there's a curious brand of Frenchman who enjoys penetrating innocent unmoving rather asexual females who haven't adjusted to the realities of life. The post-coital cigarette probably gets replaced by a Chupa Chup: dirty talk goes no further than `pee pee' (and we're not talking watersports here).  <br /> <br />The film really nosedives when she starts to fall for Nino, played by Mathieu Kassovitz. In short she becomes the odd girl at school whom you had a major crush on, kept asking out and then realized once you were going out with her that she spent much of her time talking to her dog as she believed he could understand her better than most people. The notes Amelie leaves, the excruciating caf scene where he can't immediately recognize her due to the disguise she wears on the photos she left... as the disguise consists of a Zorro hat and eye mask, one can only surmise that Nino is brutally myopic. She makes him wander halfway around Paris pursuing photos and pieces of paper, messes him around without a thought, he falls for him despite all of this and yet can't recognize her close up, unadorned with aforementioned Zorro semi-outfit? By the end of it you'll be screaming at her to actually talk to the damn guy because you know the film won't finish until she ends up with him and you want to go to bed/go out/do anything other than watch this girl prolong the tedium any further. Eventually she does snag the chap, they embrace, kiss cheeks and then dispatch themselves to bed. Perhaps there is symbolism there in that she previously found sex to be an unemotional detached experience and, now that she is with the man of her dreams, it becomes something more fulfilling. It doesn't come over as a grand statement about romance and true love though, more a sugary-sweet daydreamer's idea of what true love is like and how to snare a partner. <br /> <br />The story is very simple, the plot hardly that imaginative yet there are masses of people out there who praise this film to the heavens. In terms of romantic fantasy, it can be compared to something like Tim Burton's Big Fish and loses out to this film in every way, from characterization to plot to the depth of imagination used. It's a feel-good fairy story with none of the magic that makes Hans Christian Anderson or Brothers Grimm tales special. If you find Friends to be an example of fantastic inter-relationship screenwriting and Ally McBeal to be wonderfully quirky and imaginative then you'll suck up this film like a dehydrated sponge. The whole film is forced whimsy and, if you are of sane mind and body, the only forcing that should be undertaken is to force it out of your DVD player as quickly as possible and curse it for wasting two precious hours of your life.   <br />
1559408758|1.0|It's difficult to come up with words that will do an adequate job of describing this movie but here's one that pretty much says it all: <br /> <br />Childish - seeing Lenny (from Laverne and Shirley) speaking with a fake English accent playing air guitar pretty much sums it up.  <br /> <br />There really isn't anything good to be said about this flick.  <br /> <br />The music - unimaginative and boring as is the scriptwriting. <br /> <br />The humor - (someone mentioned \\"deadpan\\") isn't deadpan but just dead.  <br /> <br />The premise - sad and lame... a tasteless \\"Rutles\\" parody. <br /> <br />The acting (if you want to call it that) - juvenile at best <br /> <br />There is nothing good to be said about this video other than that it points out how worthless image without content is.  <br /> <br />If Rob Reiner was trying to prove he the real life \\"meathead\\" `Archie Bunker\\" always said he was then bravo! This DVD is a worthless waste of time, effort, energy, plastic and (if you were to buy it) money too.
B000003TA4|5.0|I don't know how you can say this cd is anything more than utter brilliance.  Curt Cobain was a legend and this is the legacy he left behind.  I bow before one of the kings of music.
B000002VCT|5.0|I am able to take Pyramid, throw it into a pile with I Robot, Tales..., and even Try Anything Once and could not decide which I like better. The second tier albums, On Air, Ammonia Avenue, Eye..., Eve, Turn..., etc., are all just a slight notch below the leaders of The Alan Parsons library. I can't wait to get Valid Path and see what ole' Alan has in store for this century. But back to Pyramid, what a fluid album. I could not play this cd without songs 1-5 in order. Coincidentally, that would be side one of the old format, vinyl. Side two ain't bad either. To us prog-rock fans who still remember that there really was \\"some\\" good music back in the '70s & '80s, Parsons carved out a niche that still sounds terrific to this day. His music will never feel dated. My girlfriend, who is alot younger than i am, is astounded that such great music was made in the 1970s. She is way into music of all kinds and finds it hard to believe that she was never influenced by Parsons until I made her listen. We have a new convert, my friends. I heard years ago, that Alan Parsons had music lined up, and basically in the can, for years to come. Keep 'em coming Alan.
B0000508U6|5.0|This album has changed my life. It is one of those albums that you can just listen to over and over and over and you still think it is amazing. Probably in my top 5 records of all time. You must own this cd for your cd collection to be complete.
0156027321|3.0|Frankly, this book puzzled me.  Published in 2001, it was popular and acclaimed at the time.  The tale recounts part of Pi's youth as a boy in India, whose father runs a zoo.  When his parents decide to move to Canada, the zoo animals are sold to various other zoos.  A number of animals are bound for Canada and the US, so the family travels as their caretakers on a freighter to Canada.  The ship sinks, and Pi is the only human survivor.  He and a 450-pound tiger share the lifeboat for the long drift to Mexico.  Pi stays alive by feeding the tiger so it will not eat him.  And that is basically it, although that brief description really does the story a disservice:  There are a number of passages that are wonderful, some humorous, some written beautifully.  Other parts of it are so realistic in detail it felt like non-fiction.  And other passages were imaginative and clever, like the visit to the \\"carnivorous island.\\"  But the book is described on the jacket as a tale that will \\"make you believe in God.\\"  If it hadn't been for the expectation of some soul-shattering spiritual enlightenment, I would have considered the book just a good little novel.  So I pushed through the book, sometimes relishing the words, but mostly just wondering where it was leading and what the revelation would be.  I felt misled when the book ended without fulfilling its spiritual promise.  It might be more appropriate to say that if you want a story about a miracle, read Adrift, by Steven Callahan, which is a true story of his 76 days in a life raft crossing the Atlantic.  (Or read The Long Walk, or Annapurna, or Endurance, or any of the other excellent books of that genre.)  I am certain I would have better appreciated this story, for the plot as well as the craftsmanship, if I hadn't been expecting miracles.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is the first \\"rock\\" album i ever owned and it is still one of my favorites ever.  I could listen to this cd all day and never get tired of it. There is no song on the cd that i even think about skipping. With songs like \\"Say it aint so\\" and \\"Only in Dreams\\" you never want the cd to be over.  I think this cd is a perfect blend of different kinds of music. I dont think anyone can say they dont like at least one song on this album. A job well done weezer.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|It seems that other reviewers feel that the only reason some might find this movie lacking is the fact that the main characters don't have sex.<br /><br />Not at all.  In fact, I think I would have felt cheated had they taken their relationship past where they did.<br /><br />This movie was lacking because it had no direction, woefully poor character development, and did very little with copious resources to create a truly captivating story.<br /><br />Frankly, I think most people didn't like this story simply because it was boring.<br /><br />If you want to see two boring, rude, unhappy white people wandering around a foreign country while apparently appreciating very little of the culture and even less of the fantastic opportunity to expand their horizons, please watch this movie.
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles are in a word AMAZING. How one band can write so many good songs on one album is beyond me. When i first heard this cd, i just had to sit back after it was over stunned. The number of unbelievable songs on this cd is amazing; Drive my car, Norwegian wood, Nowhere Man, Michelle, Girl, In my Life. I bow before The Beatles yet again, they never let me down.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I have met 3 kinds of radiohead fans.  People who believe OK COMPUTER is their best album, others who think KID A is their best album, and a few who think AMNESIAC is the best.  I have come to notice that most fall in to the OK COMPUTER category, admiring the older more rock based sound that they have come to almost abandon in AMNESIAC.  Many of these people dislike AMNESIAC and dismiss it as too weird and/or uncollected.  Then coming in a close second are the people who believe KID A is the best, usually taking like to the ambiance and artsy feel of the record. I find these people are usually somewhat educated and are aware of the intelligence put into the album, and the musical genius that was used to make it.  These people tend to like a few songs on AMNESIAC but do not feel that the whole record is the best work they have done. Then there the few who think AMNESIAC is the best.  We are the oddballs, who are often users of drugs, and either are highly educated, or do not care about academia entirely.  We (I) prefer the bleak chaotic soundscape that this album brilliantly provides, and are/am unapologetic in loving the dark, abstract, avant-garde driven feel of the record. Words can't explain how smart this album really is. Let's just say in a perfect world, that you either play this album during the integration of calculus equations, or at the twilight of a ketamine trip.  But I Might be Wrong...
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Before I obtained this trilogy I had been reading hundreds of reviews and discusion forums on how terrible these movies are and how changed they are.  I got the trilogy yesterday, had a party with my family, and watched all 3 films back to back to back.  A New Hope was just like it was years ago and it was better.  Even Greedo did not get in the way of enjoying this movie.  When it was over, we all clapped for the credits and agreed at how great it was.  The seconed one was spotless and even the lightsabers were just right.  The new Boba Fett voice was just right!  Empire Strikes Back has not changed!!!  The last one , ROTJ, took the cake with the Battle of Endor and the final lightsaber battle.  These three films were an epic journey that I had not enjoyed that much ever in my life.  These are so much better than the originals.  I know that the Hayden replacement sucks now but after watching the episode three trailer, I have no doubt that people will have a different respect for him after they see episode three.  The trilogy I saw last night was the same trilogy I had seen when I was little.  It also can now pass for the best trilogy of all times!   <br /> <br />PS:  In case you were thinking that I must not be a true star wars fan who knows all the little details, your wrong.  I just am telling you the truth.  These movies made me proud to be an original trilogy star wars fanatic!
B00004R99J|5.0|I'll start by saying that \\"Pocahontas\\" is my absolute favorite Disney animation ever. Yes, it is different from Disney's other animation offerings, and this is what I loved (and still love) about it. It's a much more serious film and the so-called \\"muted, dull\\" colors used only reinforce this. It's supposed to be intense and make you feel something other than ooey-gooey waffiness. For Disney romance buffs, the love story between John Smith and Pocahontas unfolded... so beautifully, I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. It's a love based on mutual understanding and respect and watching it blossom is a treat in itself. The bitter-sweet conclusion only adds to the intensity of it all (and I'm still--after several years--trying very hard to forget about the steaming pile of turd that was \\"Pocahontas II\\"). Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. <br /> <br />The characters all had their own vivid personalities and I agree with those who've said that Pocahontas (Disney's Pocahontas, for all you \\"history\\" fanatics out there) is an amazing young lady. She's different from Disney's other, more light-hearted heroines. The film is different from Disney's other, more light-hearted ones. If this is not your cup of tea, then that's really a huge shame. However, I think that just about anyone can truly enjoy this film if they'd just throw aside any preconceived notions and just watch; just enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br />A little aside: The people who've written enraged reviews saying that Disney's \\"Pocahontas\\" wasn't historically accurate and therefore dreck, should just get rid of their DVDs and never speak of this film EVER again (please, for the sake of my SANITY). What were the lot of you expecting, exactly? This is a Disney film, for crying out loud, not a blasted History Channel program. Also, those saying the racism in it was horrid/unnecessary/etc... well I'm sorry, but that's just about the entire point of this story; the message being that racism is BAD and that we should all try and accept differences and understand eachother, for nothing good can come out of hatred. This isn't even presented to the audience in symbolism, it's up-in-your-face clear. I just can't believe that it eluded so many people.
B00003OSTQ|4.0|Chayevsky's \\"Hospital\\" I think was a better satire.  \\"Network\\" has one serious flaw: with its long speeches, and flowery, at times, language, it is more suitable to the stage than the screen.  Movie dialoge should be sharp, crisp, pithy. The dialogue here needs some editing, and that would make the script tauter and more effective.  Having said that, this is a hilarious, black comedy about television and the people behind the scenes.  Chayevsky skewers them beautifully (as did Fred Allen, years before him) and the result is a tought-provoking, prescient, yet very entertaining film.    Peter Finch, as a news anchor who loses it one night and promises to commit suicide on the air, turns in a sterling performance as Howard Beale.  He is the main reason I watch the movie again and again.  His rantings on the air result in high ratings and the bigwigs, who at first wanted to fire him, keep him on to exploit his initial appeal. (Beale's rantings are long, but are appropriate to his character and are interesting to listen to). His appeal wanes, but then he is given his own show, along with a soothsayer and others, that is meant as pure entertainment, and has nothing to do with news.  This has happened on the radio, with the ranting right wing commentators, but TV news has not really taken this path (except maybe for cable).      William Holden, as Howard's longtime friend, Max, is a TV executive at the station (UBS).  He is the most human, sympathetic character in the film.  He thinks Howard is having a nervous breakdown and should be taken off the air, but the top brass disagrees *mainly because of his high ratings) and he is kept on, despite the fact that he regularly faints on the air at the end of his rantings.  Many of Max's speeches, to his wife, and to Faye Dunaway, are much too long, and need editing. He leaves his still good looking wife, to move in with the heartless, career-driven, Dunaway (he has been fired from UBS and is writing a memoir about his early daysin television).  This act, to me, seems unconvincing, as Max is the only character in the film with any humanity left; the affair makes him a little less sympathetic character.  He never really explains why he leaves his wife.  Eventually, he leaves Dunaway, but the whole affair does not seem like somethig Max would do.  Holden, as usual, turns in a solid performance as Max.    Faye Dunaway plays a young executive who has no life outside of her job. She is ruthless (takes over Max's job behind his back), and will do anything to get what she wants.  But she talks too fast.  She too has speeches that are too long, and added to the fact that she tends to deliver her lines too quickly (granted, it is in character) makes her irritating to watch.  I suppose you should feel sorry for her in some way, but Dunaway is not that good of an actress.      Chayevsky is right on when he predicts reality shows, by having the network produce a television show centered on a real revolutionary group's bank hold-ups (even including a Patty Hearst character).    Ned Beatty, in a small role, plays the head of CCA, the company that has bought UBS.  After Howard has gone on the air and exposed a buyout of CCA by a consortium of banks, etc., owned by the Saudis, he goes on the air and exhorts his listeners to write to the White House in an attempt to block the deal (sound familiar?).  Beatty takes Howard into a board room and shouts, \\"You have tampered with the primal order, Mr. Beale.\\"  He goes on and on about how the only thing that matters is money, and how nations and democracies are obsolete, that only business and international companies matter in this day and age (right on again, Mr. Chayevsky).  Beatty delivers his tirade majestically, demonically; it is one of the most memorable moments in the picture, again proving the adage \\"there are no small roles, just small actors.\\" Howard sits there listening as if in a trance, and at the end of the tirade says \\"I have heard the voice of God\\"or something like that.  He is told to preach this new gospel on his TV show.  And he does.  And his ratings go down.  So the executives, unable to replace Howard, because Beatty likes him, decide to have him assassinated, on the air, of course.  And in s voice-over, Max says, \\"So Howard Beale was the first news anchor who was murdered because of low ratings.\\"    Robert Duvall plays an exec of CCA, the company that has bought UBS.  He once again proves that he is one of the finest actors in Hollywood, turning in a great performance as Frank, the quintessential company man, who cares only about percent shares of the TV audience UBS receives, and making money.  He fires Max.  You really hate him.      It is fun to watch this film and see how many of Chayevsky's predictions have come true.  Quite a few.  This a film replete with good guys and bad guys, and there is little question where Chayevsky's sympathies lie.  This is a very good film, but not a great film.
B00004R99U|1.0|This sequel completely pisses all over the memory of its brilliant predecessor. I bought the VHS edition when it first came out several years ago and there I was, a bright-eyed kid, ready to be WOWed by more of my favorite heroine and what I got was... essentially, crud. <br /> <br />Now, it wasn't the entire John Rolfe thing that bugged me. I'll admit that I didn't like him, but it wasn't because I'm such a huge John Smith/Pocahontas fan; it was because he was such a boring, humdrum character. The entire story was rushed and just felt so very unncessary. It lacked the dynamic, mood, charm, and heart of the first \\"Pocahontas.\\" Coincidentally (although not surprisingly), it also lacked the good music. <br /> <br />The real kicker is, I can hardly remember anything concrete about this movie. I remember having seen it a few times and having absolutely hated it, but it's surprisingly forgettable. The only thing is that I can't forget that I actually watched it and that it nearly burned out my retinas and destroyed a few of my brain cells in the process. I oh-so-honestly wish that I could un-watch this heinous direct-to-video sequel (or that Disney would disown it and say they weren't at all thinking straight when they decided to create it), because it was so bad that it nearly ruins the original movie for me.
B000002UAR|5.0|I've got something against those sitars, I don't like them as much as the other reviewers here, and those freaky sounds that Revolver introduced in terms of Beatle music. Not yet completely different (Sgt. Pepper is) and not the music we're used to (Help! is). It's like something in between.  <br />Revolver is a good album. It's got amazing songs like Taxman, Eleanor Rigby (kind of), I'm Only Sleeping, Yellow Submarine, Here There And Everywhere (kind of), And Your Bird Can Sing ... In fact, all are good, some less than others, but still. This album has got some highlights: <br /> <br />1. Good Songs <br />The album has a pack of good songs that we're not used to at all. Here, There And Everywhere and For No One are normal songs, and Tomorrow Never Knows is stranger than I Am The Walrus itself. I'm Only Sleeping is a great song too. <br /> <br />2. For No One <br />This is easily the greatest song here. It's a timeless amazing song that sounds like the old Beatles. I could listen to it over and over again. Easily the best lyrics I've heard in a song too. <br /> <br />3. Tomorrow Never Knows <br />Another favourite, but the reason I put it here is it's spectacular. I had heard about it before, and had a picture of it in my mind. But no, it's something completely different. Lennon does sound as in he's in a mountain, and it's nightime, and there are monks, and he's a i-cant-remember-what priest. The drum pattern carries you away. Everything is spectacular. Lennon wanted to record how an LSD trip is like, and he made it.
B0000669JL|5.0|I've always liked reggae music, but didn't develop an 'obsession' until my Dad bought \\"The Reggae Rocks - The Tide Is High: A Tribute To Rock 'N' Roll\\" in Summer of 2001.  From there it continued to grow and finally settled a little until I got into Bob Marley & the Wailers in Spring of 2002 and now own 20 albums and compilations by this legendary band.   <br /> <br />While this wasn't my first Bob Marley & the Wailers CD, I didn't have many of the songs at the time, so I purchased it and I was blown away.  This CD is amazing and is the ultimate introduction to Bob Marley & the Wailers and reggae music in general.  The CD meets the needs of the hardcore fan wanting a classic Marley compilation while at the same time delivering many of the greatest hits for the casual listener.  While there are a select few hits not present such as \\"Lively Up Yourself,\\" that hardly matters here.  Enjoy Legend for what it is: a testament to the legacy and standard set by the greatest reggae band of all time.
B00004W52U|5.0|You cannot beat this album. IT is to perfect. Knowledge must be the best song to start an album i've ever heard. IT may be the best on the album. Lint is an awsome guitarst, who makes songs like bad town really shine. Matt is one of the best bassists i've ever heard. Jessie has an incredible voice, and the lyrics may be the best i've ever heard. Dave is a awsome drummer, who puts an interesting beat into everything. The best songs are Knowledge, Sound system, Jaded, take warning, unity, bad town, gonna find you, caution, and yellin in my ear. That may sound like alot, and it is, but there are 27 tracks. Yeah 27 tracks of punk nirvana.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain is a fantastic film and i encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to get out and rent or buy this movie when it becomes available.  it's funny and entertaining.  Jude Law and Gwyneth give a great performance together in this film.  so get out there and see it!!
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I absoulutely loved this festival.  It was one of, if not, the best guitar playing footage I have seen on a DVD.  It had Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, Clapton, King, ZZ Top, BUDDY GUY, JIMMIE VAUGHAN, and others, but missed one important player that deserved to be on the DVD:  Jeff Beck.  I was disappointed when I bought the DVD and realized he wasn't on there.  It had John Mayer (who did great) and Johnny Lang (who could have had a better song on the film), but did not have Jeff Beck!?  I couldn't believe it!  That's why I only gave the disc 4/5 stars because I feel like it could have been better.  Maybe they will come out with another disc or something (probably not, but I can hope).  If you want to see good guitar playing, BUY this DVD.  If you want to see Jeff Beck...then go see him in concert.
0804106304|5.0|...but born here in the United States, I found myself relating all too well with this book.  Amy Tan has done what I had previously thought was impossible: getting me in touch with my asian heritage and allowing me to forgive my mother for our many differences. <br /> <br />She writes with such beautiful sensitivity to all of her characters, it is impossible not to get addicted to all of her work!
B00003CXDV|4.0|Not only does this film parody the Star Trek series and its spinoffs, the cast of the former must've been in the minds of the creators because it seems to tell that cast's stories.  But generally I'd say, this film is about what makes people keep going throughout their jobs everyday, that there is hope, and even meaning in some of what we do, individually.  Maybe we matter, maybe our beliefs matter.  Many of us don't really like our jobs.  Maybe we lose conviction.  The movie approaches these ideas with a notion of hope.  It is a comedy, and most people I know have a good time watching it and like it.  I give it four stars out of five because it is a fun movie and takes itself and the comedy seriously.  It has a good pace.
B00030590I|4.0|Director Zhang Yimou's brilliant and haunting meditation on the birth of the Chinese empire should appeal to fans of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The film focuses on China's first emperor who seeks to unite the warring provinces and a group of master assasins who stand in his way. Jet Li is the nameless warrior who kills the assasins and arrives on the emperor's doorstep. He tells the story of his battles, seen in flashback. But Li's story is soon contradicted by the emperor, who sees a plot to assasinate him. The result is a mosaic of Rashomon-like contradictory flashbacks filled with stunning kung fu acrobatics. Yimou removes the usual hokey jokes associated with the kung fu genre (the film is strikingly humorless), concentrating instead on making the film as beautiful as possible.. The screen is drenched in amazing colors, computer animation and graceful violence. This work of art deserves to be seen.<br /><br />B+
B00006LLLN|5.0|I have listened to this 2-cd set non-stop for the past year!  the production is fantastic;  the instrumentals are perfection!  I only wish the group would expand their tour locations!!!  this CD set has helped me get through graduate school.  Thank you, AKUS!      Update almost a year later:  This is still my favorite CD, after all this time.  Saw AKUS in Telluride, CO in person.  They're even better live!
B00068IOWM|4.0|...thank God it's not a Brittany, Jessica, or KORN release. <br /> <br />Artists are going to sound different from when they started out. U2 is no different. Look at the Stones after 23 years...they gave us what...\\"Dirty Work\\"? Which sure wasn't their best effort, nor did it sound like \\"12X5\\", \\"Aftermath\\", or \\"Beggars Banquet\\", their early career 5 star-ers. <br /> <br />What is amazing after hearing HTDAAB only once, how much it sounds like a \\"lost (and recently found) recordings\\" album. <br /> <br />Vertigo from \\"Achtung, Baby\\", Love and Peace or Else from \\"Zooropa\\", A Man and A Woman from \\"Rattle and Hum\\", The Original Of The Species from \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", Yahweh from \\"The Joshua Tree\\", City Of Blinding Light from \\"Boy\\" (yes, their first album). I could go on.  <br /> <br />Yes, I am a fan. Is HTDAAB their best? Probably not, but only time will tell. Am I crying sellout because the band is hawking iPods? Not really. I'm not as upset as Led Zep fans should be at that band for using \\"Rock and Roll\\" to sell Cadilacs!!! Talk about your sell outs!!! <br /> <br />It seems instead of defining a new direction, U2 have simply revisited familiar terrain with their chiming guitars and solid bass and drum sound. And what's wrong with that? It's better than 99% of the crap on Clear Channel Radio. <br /> <br />So take HTDAAB for what it's worth - A once every 4 or 5 year release from a band that is taking just enough chances to keep themselves honest, their fans happy, and their detractors wishing they would simply go away.  <br />
B00068IOWM|5.0|those are the only words that i can say, it's a great one, everyone who likes u2 should have,if you are a true u2 fan get it, by the way to me is one of the best of 2004 and maybe 2005.
B0002O7XVI|4.0|I wish I didn't have to give such a negative review for this film. But, anyway, it's unanimous, everyone agrees that a better effort could have been made to show this film in it's truest colors. It looks no better than the VHS tape version. I wish they wouldn't use the term \\"special edition\\" when it leaves so much to be desired. If they re-release this again in the future, will they refer to it as the \\"not so special, new and improved edition\\"? Maybe this is called the \\"special edition\\" because this one doesn't come with the book.  Well, regardless, I still have to have this film in my library. Maybe my tolerance is more adamant than perhaps a first time watcher of this film. The undenyably poor video transfer of this otherwise wonderful film seriously reduces the integrity of the quality of my choices for family films. I don't think my kids will get into this film because it is a long film with eyesore inducing limited visual quality.<br /><br />And I usually don't need all the \\"blah-blah-blah\\" extras that you usually get with a 2-DVD edition release (thank God this is only one DVD).  I just want my films to look and sound as cutting-edge mastered as technologically possible.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Listen, I have been a hip-hop fan for mannnny years, starting out with the Rakim/Eric B, LL Cool J era of hip-hop...    In 1996, Eminem dashed into the rap scene with his first album INFINITE, which proved he was a competent lyricist without enough backing and good production. In 1999, he was signed To Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, and he dropped the Slim Shady LP, which is an all-out classic album. Well you know the rest, don't you? Well, since I reviewed ENCORE recently, I figured I should go back to the time when Em was at his highest lyrical level...In 2000/2001, when he released The Marshall Mathers LP...    Track Ratings  --------------  1.P.S.A 2000 (N/A)  2.Kill You (5 Stars)  3.Stan (5 Stars)  4.Paul (N/A)  5.Who Knew (5 Stars)  6.Steve Berman (N/A)  7.The Way I Am (5 Stars)  8.The Real Slim Shady (5 Stars)  9.Remember Me (4 1/2 Stars)  10.I'm Back (5 Stars)  11.Marshall Mathers (5 Stars)  12.Ken Kaniff (N/A)  13.Drug Ballad (3 1/2 Stars)  14.Amityville (3 1/2 Stars)  15.B*tch Please II (5 Stars)  16.Kim (3 1/2 Stars)  17.Under The Influence (4 1/2 Stars)  18.Criminal (5 Stars)    Em opens the album perfectly, with his infamous \\"Kill You\\" track, which is a prime example of woman degrading.     On songs like \\"Stan\\" and \\"The Way I Am\\", Em gives us true Reality Rap. \\"Stan\\" is the famous story of the obsessed fan, but in my opinion, \\"The Way I Am\\" is lyrically better, as we see Em lashing out at fans and critics in a lyrical barrage.    Em shows us some humour on songs like \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", which includes incredible production and lyrics at the same time.     My two favourite songs on the album are \\"Marshall Mathers\\" and \\"Criminal\\"...On the first of the two, Em gets VERY personal, basically taking us further into his messed up mind. On \\"Criminal\\", Em gives us humour mixed in with reality, attacking gays, and showing us how dumb his critics really are. Classic stuff.    In conclusion, if you are a rap fan, you will LOVE this album. Go cop it ifyou haven't already!    Top 3 Songs:  1.Marshall Mathers  2.Criminal  3.The Way I Am    Worst 3 Songs:  1.NOT APPLICABLE  2.NOT APPLICABLE  3.NOT APPLICABLE    ( There are weaker moments on the album, but none of the songs belong in the \\"worst\\" list, because they are all listenable on different times...((i.e DRUG BALLAD, KIM, AMITYVILLE, etc)) )
B0002S947K|5.0|every time i listen to this album, really listen to it, it makes me want to cry-- or actually makes me cry, depending on who's around. it is seriously the most beautiful music i have heard in a long time. the perfect soundtrack for a cross between slow dancing barefoot in a candlelit room and watching a lone cowboy riding off into the sunset-- even though those things don't happen to most of us, maybe that's just the point. the album speaks to a sadness and soulfulness that very few people ever know, but we are lucky to have great artists like ray lamontagne bring this depth to us. his voice is simply beautiful. get this album, you will not be disappointed. <br />
B0006IIKS0|5.0|One of the finest music films I have ever seen. Berlinger and Sinofsky have struck gold with this intimate look at men in crisis. Who would have ever thought a band like Metallica would open themselves up in such a painful way. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A mixture of humor and high drama makes this one of the most amazing film experiences I have ever had. A must buy.
B00005JMAH|5.0|So there was a lot of liberties taken, but the thing is, they were necessary to make this a great movie. The first two movies directed by Chris Columbus may have followed the storyline strictly, but it was TOO strictly that they came out bad as movies. A good book doesn't equal a good movie!!! <br /> <br />I have to say, this is the best out of all three movies. For a movie to be good, there has to be some kind of focus in the plot, which is what Azkaban had, and I just loved the graphics and scenery, which were much more explored in this movie than the other two. There's also improvement on the acting on behalf of the kids, quite apparent after several films of practicing now. Except Dumbledore... I feel like the first actor did a lot better: there was a graver and more powerful sense to him. The new Dumbledore reminds me of Professor Flitwick. <br /> <br />Overall, this was an awesome movie, even if it didn't follow the book so strictly (which is actually a GOOD thing). Because hey, if I wanted to read the book, I have all of them here!! But I wanted to watch a movie worth my time and money, and this one definitely was.
B00005JNDX|5.0|Ahhh! What a lovely thing it is to anticipate a movie for two years to have it meet and go beyond every expectation!<br /><br />Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was wonderful!!  It felt like watching the first one for the first time again.  Well, except this time around, we all know that dear Mr. Cleaver is a complete dirty pratt and that handsome Mr. Darcy is every woman's dream come true!<br /><br />The story line was just as substantial as the first.  With the first, Bridget was struggling with her \\"little demons\\" (i.e., weight, smoking, drinking, verbal diarrhea, etc).  In this one, she continues (as we all do) struggling with those demons, but there is a new twist (do not worry... no spoilers).  She is struggling with the most evil of demons... insecurity.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful with the slight exception (IMO) of Mark \\"Wanker\\" Darcy ;) (Colin Firth).  Every now and again, it seemed as though his heart just wasn't quite into the project.  It was very slight, however.  It truly was not enough to ruin the movie... trust me!  He was his normal, gorgeous, charming, eloquent self 98% of the time! Gorgeous man!<br /><br />Rene Zellweger (sp?) seems to have gained more weight (in the face) in this movie.  It was quite odd... her body seems trimmer, but her face more round. Amazing! However, she was as cute and lovable as ever! There could never be a different actress for Our Little Bridget!<br /><br />Hugh Grant appears to have lost quite a bit of weight.  He's as handsome and clever as ever, but his weight loss was a bit distracting.  They made Daniel Cleaver more slimy this go-round, but it was oh-so-FUN!!<br /><br />Bridget's family was as crazy and fun as ever!! They make mine appear... normal! :D<br /><br />If you're a Bridget Jones fan, you MUST see this movie ASAP!! If you're a pretty-good fan, see it during a matinee.  If you're a luke-warm fan, wait for the video.  If you're not a fan at all, please do not watch it, then come here and leave a nasty review!<br /><br />This movie is (as the first was) fun, inspiring, uplifting and most of all: Closer to the truth about real women than any other movie out!nd leave a nasty review! <br /> <br />This movie is (as the first was) fun, inspiring, uplifting and most of all: Closer to the truth about real women than any other movie out! <br />
B0006284JQ|1.0|I can't stand this white girl.  She's a man-stealing, lying, drug-taking, chain smoking, diet pill-popping, lip synching, hypocritical, talentless, trailer-park-trash jezebel tramp!  Oooh, I do NOT like this dumb skank.
B000002UAU|1.0|I don't get it. I really don't. How come this, of all the Beatles' albums, is considered such a pop masterpiece? No, not a pop masterpiece- a work of art? During the late 60s, there were a handful of albums that revolutionised the soundscape of the period : `Trout Mask Replica', `The Velvet Underground with Nico', 'Astral Weeks', `Pet Sounds' and 'The Band.' Let's not forget the umpteen psychedelic one-offs by garage bands captured on the Nuggets compilations. Sgt. Pepper don't even come close to those. The songs are mostly trite, silly, and boring. Even Macca's Frog Chorus thing of a couple of years back had a more memorable tune than most of the tracks on here. There are a few that are okay.' With A Little Help From My Friends' is pleasant enough, although Cocker's version is far superior - and that is hardly meant as a recommendation. 'Getting Better' is listenable. The rest are excruciating. `She's Leaving Home' just has to be the most sentimental tosh you will ever here in your life. It's a wonder Cilla Black never covered it.  `Lucy...' and `A Day in the Life' are the only songs that stand up to scrutiny.     It may appear as if I have no time for the Beatles. Not true. I think the Fab Four are one of the finest pop groups of the 60s and I heartily recommend such classics as `Abbey Road' and `A Hard Day's Night.' Sgt Pepper, however, I hate. I even hate the cover, which is fussy and scrappy.  The photographic portraits of Robert Freeman are far more striking and pleasing to the eye. Avoid this album as if it had a picture of your mother on the front - your mother naked!
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|I give this \\"collection\\" 1 star, just because there is no 0-star rating. If you are old enough to remember this spectacle and have seen the original broadcast, you'd notice immediately how much is missing from this 4DVD issue. To me, it is nothing but a scam. Not to mention that UK and US versions are very different, but even combined do not give you the real deal (full concert), and there is absolutely no excuse for this. Why? I'll tell you why - some, like Santana and Led Zeppelin did not allow their appearances to go on DVD but there is certainly much more behind this shameful 4DVD issue that the public may never find out. Individual vanity and/or greed for more profit should never be put above such a spectacular and unique event. People, this was a once in a life time deal, get it? I had been fortunate enough to have seen the WHOLE concert at the time of the original broadcast and even had the WHOLE thing on tapes, but over time they got lost and/or destroyed. Seeing this poor excuse called 4DVD set, I now bitterly regret the circumstances that led to the demise of my tapes. <br /> <br />Shame on music industry and all the stars that deprived the world and music lovers of the integral version of this historic event, and at the same time invited the illegal market to take action. Here's just another proof that pirates are justified in whatever they're doing. You can get pirated versions of the event, and I mean The Event (the whole deal, 100%) on pirated tapes and DVD's and if the producers and stars were smart enough to figure out this was coming, we could have had the integral version, and the money would have gone to the charitable cause, not the pirates. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS SCAM - DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET UNTIL WE GET THE FULL VERSION WE DESERVE AND ARE PAYING FOR! <br />
B0006GAOCW|3.0|Katie Holmes plays the title character, as she enters college. It seems that no member of the First Family can really have any semblance to a \\"normal life\\", but this movie is supposedly a case of a First Daughter in college giving a serious shot at a fantasy of a \\"normal life\\". She starts off as a fairly sweet \\"girl next door\\" type, and it is that part of the role that Katie Holmes plays most successfully. Then in other episodes she nearly goes bonkers at having a constant presence of secret service agents all the time, and at another time waxes arbitrarily rebellious, going to a bar, getting apparently drunk, and performing a table dance, just to thumb her nose at the image expected of her as the President's daughter. The latter two episodes seem arbitrarily tacked together with the rest of her character, and make no believably smooth whole. Although we can well imagine that a lot of angst would come with the territory of being constantly in the spotlight and surrounded by secret service agents, the movie has very little impact in bringing home any aspect of that angst beyond what we would already suspect. Yet the movie does venture into that territory like it had something significant to say there. But ultimately it is like the film is torn between focusing on that angst and turning into a fairy-tale-like romance. The latter wins out in the end, with the movie getting a bit of an overlong and ponderous feeling in the process of getting there. The title character meets an apparent straightforward boyfriend with no apparent hidden surprises or strings attached (As you're probably guessing, things WON'T turn out to be exactly what they seem). She soon tells him that he might as well not try to keep any secrets from her, because one call to an FBI or CIA agent could get her any information on him that she might want. Seems that reminding him of such a thing would have been a case of \\"better to not go there\\" when fulfilling romance is being pursued. Seems to be a linethat would have much more efficacy when the intention were to run somebody off. But she tells him that, for better or worse, and the rest of the movie is largely about how things play out. As mentioned, Katie Holmes does give it a good shot at playing the title character, given the script she has to work with. And the same can be said of Michael Keaton in the unlikely role of her father. Before I saw this, what if I'd been given a list of all who have played fictitious U.S. Presidents, and I'd seen Michael Keaton on the list? I would scarcely jump to any conclusion of expecting him to be like the dignified and heroic Presidents, such as those played by Harrison Ford in AIR FORCE ONE or Morgan Freeman in DEEP IMPACT. I would have visualized him as likely much nearer the opposite end of a spectrum of cinematic Presidents, more like the biting satirical portrayal by Billy Bob Thornton in LOVE ACTUALLY, or a farcical version like Jack Nicholson in MARS ATTACKS. So I suspected to find Keaton rather miscast or at least oddly cast if his was a serious portrayal of a heroic president. But he does play it straight and likeable, with more successful results than I expected. Still, I don't think his performance will go down as one of the most memorable serious performances as U.S. Presidents. Nor will this movie go down as any groundbreaking classic. But with the right laid back expectations, you can enjoy this as a sometimes sweet and heartwarming little tale, for all the incongruities and sometimes improbabilities.

0345350499|5.0|I've read Mists of Avalon four times now, and every time I read it I get more out of it.  This book has given me an entirely new perspective on theology and the legend itself.   <br /> <br />My sister was given Mists two years ago by my father, but since it was by him, she immediately discarded it, and I promptly picked it up.  I was fourteen at the time and hadn't delved very far into the Arthurian besides watching the Merlin mini-series, reading T.A. Barron's Lost Years of Merlin books, and watching Disney's Sword in the Stone but I became interested at once. <br /> <br />I thought I knew Morgan le Fay.  I thought I knew Lancelet, Gwenhwyfar, and Morgause.  I knew nothing.   <br /> <br />This story starts out in the small castle in Cornwall known as Tintagel.  It follows Igraine, wife of Duke Gorlois, who is destined by the Merlin and the Lady of the Lake to give birth to the High King that will lead Britain into a golden era.  First rebelling against fate, she finds more and more that she falls in love with Uther Pendragon, and gives birth to Arthur.   <br /> <br />We then follow the training of Morgaine, Arthur's half sister, in the ancient ways of Avalon to become a priestess, and ultimately, the next Lady of the Lake after Viviane.  Bradley continues on to reveal how she unknowingly slept with Arthur, forsook Avalon and bore Mordred in Lothian.  <br /> <br />Bradley weaves through the Arthurian legend like none I have ever read since.  Her scrutiny of detail to both history and myth, Christianity and Druidry alike has transformed this book into a very multi-dimensional story to read again and again.  Her extensive research brings to life the real emotions of the characters, and allows us to understand two of the women considered evil: Morgaine and Morgause, and we comprehend their motives, and almost agree with them and justify their decisions.  I love this book, and recommend it to any who have the time to read this masterpiece.
B000669GAI|4.0|Pearl Jam did not form until late 1990. Before Pearl Jam existed, there was Mother Love Bone and before Mother Love Bone existed, there was Green River and Malfunkshun. Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament currently of Pearl Jam were in Green River and Mother Love Bone. Green River and Malfunkshun even existed before Nirvana. In 1988, Green River disbanded due to different musical interests. Mother Love Bone was formed in 1988, then disbanded in spring 1990 due to the death of late singer, Andrew Wood of heorin overdose in spring 1990. In late 1990, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament wanted to form a new band, they recruited Mike McCready and Eddie Vedder. They also hired original drummer, Dave Krusen. Pearl Jam was born.    Technically, Pearl Jam WAS born from the ashes of Mother Love Bone. At first, Pearl Jam wanted to name the band, Mookie Baylock after the former New Jersey Nets basketball player. Hence Peral Jam's debut album got its name, 'Ten' from Baylock's jersey number. The band thought the naming a band after a basketball player was silly. So, they decided to rename the band Pearl Jam. Their first ever recorded single was \\"State of Love and Trust\\" which first appeared on the 'Singles' motion picture soundtrack. The song is now included on this compilation.     Pearl Jam has recorded a lot of songs during the 'Ten' sessions and had a bunch of tracks which didn't make the cut on 'Ten'. \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" was one of the song that didn't make it on 'Ten'. It was originally released as a B-side to the \\"Jeremy\\" single. It recieved heavy radio airplay in Europe. Then it became a Pearl Jam live staple. It's the most requested Pearl Jam B-side ever. Radio stations everywhere airs it all the time.    Other hits on this album incluides remixes of \\"Once\\", \\"Alive\\" and \\"Black\\". Those newly remixes are awesome along with all the classics such as \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Jeremy\\" \\"Animal\\", \\"Go\\", \\"rearviewmirror\\", \\"Duaghter\\",   \\"Breath\\" (also originally appeared on the 'Singles' soundtrack), \\"SpinThe Black Circle\\" \\"Immortality\\", \\"Given To Fly\\", \\"Do The Evolution\\". There are some recent classics such as \\"Save You\\", and \\"Man of the Hour\\" as well.     Pearl Jam went on their fisrt major tour when they and The Smashing Pumpkins supported Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1991 to early 1992. Pearl Jam gained their popularity while they toured with Red Hot Chili Peppers and headlined the second Lollapalooza Tour in summer 1992. They sold millions of copies of 'Ten' in 1991 and 1992. It went tripple platinum in 1992. They sold millions of more records with their later releases and sold out their shows in the 1990's. I was lucky to see them when they toured with Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1991.     Pearl Jam is definately the most influential band of all time. Old and new Pearl Jam fans should really dig this 'Greatest Hits' compilation. It's strongly reccomemded that every Pearl Jam fans should also hunt down those old Green River, Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone records or CD's if they want to know how Pearl Jam really existed and where they got their musical sound from. I totally dig Grunge music from the 80's and the early 90's. I totally dig Pearl Jam's 'rearviemirror (greatest hits 1991-2003)'. Go pick up a copy, you know you want it and you will not be disappointed!
B000002J27|5.0|Genesis was considered dead in 1976. Peter Gabriel had left for a solo career and he was widely considered as the mastermind of the group. So now we have a group without its main writer and lead singer. Obviously the band had to put together something spectacular to show the public that they were still Genesis and they weren't going anywhere. So Phil Collins steps out from behind the drums (Bill Bruford was an early tour replacement and was later replaced my Chester Thompson) to do lead vocals. The album starts off with Dance on a Volcano and ends with Los Endos. From end to end it sounds very much like the Gabriel-Era Genesis. My personal favorite track is Los Endos. What an energetic song! The live cuts of it are even better. If you buy this album and like it, I highly suggest buying \\"Seconds Out\\" as well. That's some great tracks from their 1977 tour. Would I recommend this album? YES!
B00005JNEI|2.0|Obviously, Michael Moore wanted to make a provocative film, and \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" succeeds on that score: Endless debate has centered on this film. However, I was surprised by how leaden it was compared to his more entertaining (and effective) \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" and \\"Roger and Me.\\"  Although some scenes were undeniably powerful - such as interviews with the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, other sections did not work very well, particularly snippets of political speeches taken out of context.<br /><br />However, to me, the biggest flaw was Moore's mixed messages about the armed forces. He repeatedly hammers home the message that the men and women sent to Iraq are from poor neighborhoods and signed up because of a lack of other opportunities in their lives, making them sympathetic.  However, in interviews with soldiers in Iraq, he depicts them as ruthless killing machines - carelessly killing Iraqi civilians while listening to Drowning Pool.  Why does Moore undermine his message so severely?<br /><br />Overall, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is a middling documentary, but the fact that it was so successful cannot be denied. The American public was seeking out in a film the answers they didn't think they were getting from politicians and even the media. Perhaps that's the legacy of this film, especially as it seems so outdated already, just weeks after the election.
630463949X|5.0|I own both the CD and the tape, since I`m a fan of Fleetwood Mac, and if you like some of their songs, you should have one of this. A friendly environment and a loving crowd gives the concert a magic touch.
B000002HH9|1.0|As a part of this little online review thingie, let me tell you a story dear friends that ties into this record, the Cure's 1995 \\"opus\\" \\"Wild Mood Swings\\". <br />It was early winter in the year 1996. I was at a friends house who had just gotten back from his grandparents house after the Christmas holiday. He had gotten a large bag of new C.D.'s. One of them was the Cure's \\"Wild Mood Swings\\". I was thirteen, and although I had heard of the Cure, mostly good things, I had never actually heard the Cure. So I asked him if I could put it in and see what all the fuss about. He said sure, so I put said disc into the C.D player and pressed play. For the next forty five minutes or so, this record swirled the room, and a large throbbing began to fill my head. This was, without doubt, the worst record I had ever heard. <br />Flash foward several years to 2001, when another friend of mine was getting it into the Cure. I had not listened to them that faithful day, with the exeception of a few radio singles, and had no real interest to pursue them. Said friend insisted that I listen to the Cure's amazing \\"Disintigration\\". I did and loved it. I listened to a lot of their other stuff. Same reaction. Had I been to hasty in my assumption of \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" was a crappy record. I gave it a second listen. Same throbbing headache. Same crappy record. <br />You see, in my opinion, \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is one of those records that is so atrociously bad that it becomes a bit of a conversation piece. Whenever I hear a piece of music that is bad but not painful, I remark, \\"well, at least its better than 'Wild Mood Swings'\\". If I tell a friend that said music is \\"worse than 'Wild Mood Swings'\\", then they know to avoid like a rat carrying the plague. <br />What is so wrong with the Cure's \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" you may ask. Well, in a simple phrase, absolutley everything. Apparently the group was trying to recreate the feel of \\"The Head on the Door\\" and \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\", meaning genreshifting records that create different tones and feels, but fail. The songs on this record are just horrendous, numbing ditties that fail to create a single memorable melody or mood(although if that mood is great discomfort, than maybe they were on to something after all). The lyrics are borderline idiotic, and never fail to crack me up with their cheesy, cliche ridden feel. The bass lines of Simon \\"Elvis\\" Gallup, the saving grace of quite a few Cure ditties that weren't peak material, are gone, buried deep under irritating keyboards and Robert Smith's voice, once on of their strongest assests, but on this record replaced with a howling whine, bellowing off key over nearly every number. <br />\\"Wild Mood Swings\\" reeks of a band that has fallen apart at the seems, and its all to evident that they just don't care(this is doubled by the better but still lackluster records that followed this). <br />I hate \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" with a passion. Its an embarrassing record in my opinion. That's not to say if you like it that you're wrong(though I'm curious how you can like it). Music is all subjective you understanf. But to my ears, \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" belongs in the dollar bin to rot away for the rest of time.
B0002HTZJI|1.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best bands i have heard, unfortunately, this album does not capture this. Not one of the songs sound anywhere as good as the studio version, and this ablbum actually made me question these guys musical credibility. Shocking album from an ausome band, stick with the studio versions.
6305327084|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, hands down. The more you watch it the more layers you realize the film has. Michael Rappaport's model-obsessed character is great (his dog is named Elle MacPherson). Natalie Portman is fabulous as the 13 year old neighbor. If you are from a small town but moved away and have gone back to visit your HS friends that still live there you will appreciate this film. The title refers to the fact that all the girls in the film are beautiful (except maybe Darian, who is physically beautiful but ugly inside) but most of the guys don't realize it until it's too late. I cannot recommend this movie enough!
6304698526|4.0|\\"Bullitt\\" is considered by many to be Steve McQueen's best performance.  That by itself says a lot about the movie.  However, \\"Bullitt\\" is not a movie that everyone will enjoy.  My first impression in seeing it as a teenager was that this movie was too complicated to really enjoy.  Over the years, I given it an occassional look and have begun to appreciate it a lot more.  It fits into that class of movies popular in the 1940's and 50's called Film Noir in which we see the darker and seedier sides of life.  The heroes are often not too far removed from the bad guys and there doesn't ever seem to be a happy ending.  It's hard to come away from one of those movies feeling good about anything.  Just because you can call a movie part of the \\"Film Noir\\" genre doesn't automatically make it a good movie.  However, it also doesn't automatically make it a bad movie either. <br /> <br />There is much to appreciate in \\"Bullitt\\".  The acting is terrific and I'm not just talking about McQueen.  The character played by Robert Vaughn is disgusting but it isn't until later that it hits you that it's Vaughn's performance that creates the character's impact on you.  Of course, there's the car chase.  I don't know about you but I think I may have heard too much about it to really enjoy it the first time I saw it.  However, I have come to realize that this really is the definitive car chase.  Its' successors have generally overdone their chase scenes by focussing on the collateral damage rather than the chase itself.   <br /> <br />\\"Bullitt\\" is not a work of art but it is a great movie.  It may be hard to tell who the good guys are, it may be hard to understand WHY everything that happened had to happen, and it may be unclear as to just what the ending means.  However, if you watch it without expectations, it is sure to exceed them.
B00005JN0T|2.0|I only remember the robots face after the movie. I am sure you will too. but that's all it's about. heck, I dont have much to say besides that. <br /> <br />this movie is waste of time.
B00009ATKS|5.0|This album almost perfectly blends a number of instruments and ambient noises together to create an emotional mood that cannot be expressed in words.  Even if you don't like the genre, I think it would be hard to say that the music doesn't touch you in some way or another.  Mogwai's ability to blend some kind of an electronic, errie ghost-like voice with a guitar, drums and bass make you feel like you're in a musical trance.  The flow of the music is beyond comprehension, it almost fits perfectly like a puzzle.  These guys are amazing, and I highly recommend this cd to anyone who is familiar with the genre.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|If you are looking for a great CD to add to your collection, this is it.  Rarely do I find a CD I can pop into my CD player and let it play beginning to end.  Each track on this CD is better than the one before.  Gavin DeGraw has pure, relaxing voice that has so much emotion in it.  This CD is worth the money and you will definitely not regret making the purchase.  If Gavin is in your city and you are able to get tickets, I recommend going to his concert.  It was the best live show I have ever seen!  He is phenomenal.
B000068R1X|5.0|Bark At The Moon(1983). Ozzy Osbourne's Third Solo Album.<br /><br />In 1982, while on tour for 'Diary of A Madman', brilliant guitar virtuoso Randy Rhoads was killed in a freak airplane accident, ending the life of one of the most gifted and talented guitarists of our time, and momentarily putting Ozzy's solo career on hold. As grief-stricken Ozzy(who lost his best friend) considered retiring, his wife Sharon pulled him through his grief and convinced him to start back over his career. Fortuneatly, Ozzy listened to his wife and hired guitarist Jake E. Lee, a newcomer to the heavy metal world, to sucede Randy Rhoads, and he went on to make two albums, 'Bark At The Moon' and 'The Ultimate Sin', before he was replaced with Zakk Wylde. Fans eagerly awaited the new album, and, when 'Bark At The Moon' was released, MTV put \\"Bark At The Moon\\" into heavy rotation, and the video and the song have since became extremely famous, and it pushed the album to platinum sucess. So, is 'Bark At The Moon' as good as the albums before it, or just a weak effort from a grief-stricken Ozzy? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Bark At The Moon- The album's big hit, \\"Bark At The Moon\\" bears a strong resemblance to Ozzy's hit \\"Shot In The Dark\\", with it's chugging guitar riff and crazed vocals(Ozzy manages to even howl a few times). The synthesizer is nicely mixed with Lee's chuggy riffs, and it reminds me of \\"No More Tears\\" at many times. Lee's heavily distorted solo also boggles the mind. An impressive opener!<br /><br />You're No Different- As usual, Ozzy's has a few ballads, and \\"You're No Different\\" is his first on 'Bark At The Moon'. Behind an odd organ beat, much like heard on \\"Mr. Crowely\\", Ozzy sings about how even if you're changed on the outside, you're \\"no different\\" on the inside. An uplifting song, \\"You're No Different\\" is a good ballad, with a thundering solo and interlude.<br /><br />Now You See It(Now You Don't)- A fun rocker, \\"Now You See It(Now You Don't)\\" comes across sounding like a combination of \\"Over The Mountain\\" and \\"No Bone Movies\\". Ozzy's vocals mix perfectly with Lee's guitar harmonies, which often show a little bit of a blues influence. Bob Daisley dishes out a groovy bassline, and Lee also has a nice solo. Another good addition to 'Bark At The Moon'.<br /><br />Rock N' Roll Rebel- A song that should have become a hit, \\"Rock N' Roll Rebel\\" reminds me *strongly* of Dio, with Lee showing particular influences of Dio's guitarist Vivian Campbell and the slightly mythical sounding beat. Ozzy rips out those sarcastic vocals, where he makes fun of the fact of how many people consider him an immoral satanist. Lee really sounds good on this track, and he proves how good he is here with his sweet riffs and solos.<br /><br />Centre of Eternity- An odd track to say the least, \\"Centre of Eternity\\" begins with monk's chanting eerily behind tolling bells and doomy sounding organs, until Lee's electric assault sweeps in, with Ozzy singing behind eerie keyboard effects. Much like \\"Mr. Crowely\\", \\"Centre of Eternity\\" is a song, that's a little eerie and creepy, yet still really well done. Jake Lee and keyboardist Don Airey do a great job together on \\"Centre of Eternity\\".<br /><br />So Tired- A soft, jazzy ballad by Ozzy? \\"So Tired\\" finds Ozzy singing about love and romance in the *least* heavy metal way possible, even putting in a backup orchestra behind Airey's piano, and making Lee barely noticeable until his solo. While it may sound a little left of center, \\"So Tired\\" is still a nice little track, and, if you enjoy Ozzy's other ballads, you probably would like this track pretty well.<br /><br />Slow Down- \\"Slow Down\\" could have easily been a hit, using an upbeat guitar harmony mixed with Airey's synthesizer effect. Ozzy sings his heart out, and, even though the song can get a little cheesy at times(\\"slow down, and join the human race\\"?), I can forgive Ozzy. Lee pulls out an excellent interlude and solo, and \\"Slow Down\\" stands as a good addition to the album.<br /><br />Waiting For Darkness- A *dramatic* rocker, \\"Waiting For Darkness\\" finds Ozzy singing about fitting into society and Jake Lee dishing out power chords like a madman. Although it's very melodic, with a chorus that would fit well with his ballads, the song is undeniably \\"heavy metal\\", especially with Lee's stunning guitar pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Spiders In The Night- A bass-driven rocker, \\"Spiders In The Night\\" is a creepy song with a trippy bassline, doomy guitar melody, and scary vocals from Ozzy. It's impossible not to like the dark tone of the song, and those weird bass and guitar effects will keep you interested until the end. As usual, Ozzy puts together another great track.<br /><br />Overall, 'Bark At The Moon' is a solid album, one that any heavy metal or Ozzy fan would surely enjoy. While Randy Rhoads and Zakk Wylde are often recognized while Jake E. Lee is often unrecognized, he's at least their equal, and is a worthy successor to Rhoads. While 'Bark At The Moon' and 'Original Sin' are Ozzy's worst selling and least popular efforts to date, it is unfortuneate that so many people overlook these albums... they rock! If you can, go out and get the 1995 remaster, or, just burn it off the internet, as getting the 2002 remaster gives you a rehashed version of the album.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF HEAVY METAL AND OZZY! DON'T DO WHAT SO MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE AND OVERLOOK THIS ALBUM!

B000002LKF|5.0|I'm coming out of the closet and finally putting myself on record as saying that this is Paul Simon's best album as a solo artist.  I also agree with other reviewers--this is one of the fifty best albums of the twentieth century. <br /> <br />Although Graceland was a landmark record, there were many \\"outside\\" issues with that record.  Troubles with cultural snobbery and exploitation (particularly of Los Lobos), unsituated appropriation of \\"Third World\\" musics and musicalisms, and just plain screwed up \\"liberal\\" New York elitism.  Some of that is still here in this album--even Caetano Veloso took some pot shots at Paul Simon, as has Carlinhos Brown. <br /> <br />But great art is judged by time as much as anything else, and I believe that this is a fascinating and moving record, whose subtle and shifting rhythms, melodies, harmonies, and chords represent perhaps the best admixture of Brazilian, African, and American sensibilities in the history of pop music (Jazz music is here, of course, excepted; that music is beyond this discussion and is in an entirely separate category).  The single biggest thing that sticks out for me about this album is the percussion work.  You get a broad and deep emotional working out of a variety of African-matrixed South American percussion styles, and the perhaps biggest musical achievement by Simon here is his sly and sophisticated incorporation of a stunning variety of polyrythms into his already legendary folk and folksy pop music.  This music is at times simply gorgeous--it flows like a river, and on occasion it flows thick and lovingly like hot lava. <br /> <br />This is grown-up, laid back, (in the best American/Brazilian collaborative tradition), intelligent, lovely, and wise music. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.

630467578X|5.0|The book was great...Steven King was ahead of it's time. And the MOVIE was ahead of it's time. Too bad it was made pre-DVD time, because the \\"extras\\" are total crap.  But it's worth it just to see Arnold say \\"once sub zero...now...plain zero!\\".
B0002KVULG|5.0|I had really forgotten how good this movie was.  Ok, so Frank Langella isn't Bela Lugosi who is probably the best to ever play the role. But, he's a great deal better than some of the Hammer Film actors who played various incarnations of the world's favorite bloodsucker over the years.  Highly erotic in spots, if you're looking for Lugosi, you're not going to find it in this version.  And its infinitely better than the computerized special-effects versions that have come along in recent years, make no mistake about that.  Langella's performance is on-the-money as a somewhat sexually appealling Dracula (just what the ladies need) and after having played the role on Broadway for a year prior to the movie, brought fresh insights into a character whose last good incarnation was by Lugosi.   <br />If you're a fan of the Count, have the Lugosi version and are looking to see what others have done with the role, this is the version to buy.  If you're into schlock and computerized special effects, buy one of the more recent versions. You can't go wrong with this version, despite what some others might say.
B00005JMAH|4.0|While the amount of detail and adventure in these books is far too much to fit into a movie (even one that approaches 3 hours in length), the third film in the series (based on my favorite book in the series, so far) improves in almost every way upon its predecessors.  While the first film was magical, and the most faithful to the book (it could be, since the first book was the shortest), there was far too much bad child acting going on.  Cuaron has turned the three leads into real actors, and the performances in this movie outshine those in the previous two.  This is especially true for Hermione, who was emoting up a storm in Sorceror's Stone.  She is now more natural and believable.  Also, the cinematography adds a sense of darkness and urgency to the film.  Add to that a more unique and haunting John Williams score than we've heard for a while, and much better special effects than the first two films, and you get what will probably stand as the best movie in the series even when all 7 films have been completed.

0719062683|5.0|As a literature professor, I have a professional responsibility to know about literary theory.  And let's face it: it's a pretty scary and complex subject, feared by many and mastered by few.  In fifteen years in the business, I have read many books about lit crit and literary theory, and Peter Barry's book is BY FAR the best. It is, indeed, \\"only\\" an introduction to the subject, rather than an advanced study, but it is brilliantly clear, and blessedly jargon-free.    Barry writes as though his readers are new to the subject, but bright and curious.  And he delivers the goods!  This is the book I refer to when in doubt, and the book I encourage my graduate students to purchase.  I would recommend anyone who is pursuing graduate study in the humanities to own and carefully read this book.  If you read this one carefully, you won't need any of the other intro-to-lit-crit books on the market, which simply don't measure up.
B000063DI9|5.0|The greatest metal album ever from the greatest metal band ever.  \\"Seventh Son\\" is a masterpiece that proves why Maiden blows away all the Priests, Sabbaths and Metallicas of the world.  First of all - this is Dickinson's best vocal album, no question.  I've never heard a metal vocalist sing with so much SOUL!!! (Halford - eat your heart out).  The guy is unreal.  Is there a more awesome voice in all of metal?  I think not. <br /> <br />\\"Moonchild\\" begins the album with an eerie, acoustic intro, then changes pace and turns into a RIPPING jam.  These guys were really taken by religious and mythological lyrics.  \\"Infinite Dreams\\" has a beautiful intro and great changes in tempo.  \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" is good, but a little too commercial for my liking.  \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" is awesome.  I love the lyrics.  But the title track of the album is the real show-stopper.  A nearly 10-minute epic comprised of eerie chants, BLISTERING guitar leads (the greatest playing that Smith and Murray have ever laid down) and Bruce's greatest vocal performance ever.  No joke.  Listen to those powerful, SOULFUL wails he does after each verse.  Unreal.  The guy can hold a note like you wouldn't even believe.  What a pair of vocal cords!!! <br />\\"The Prophecy\\" has a kick-ass guitar riff and a rather lovely acoustic ending.  \\"The Clairvoyant\\" has, quite possibly, the greatest chorus of any metal song ever (\\"There's a time to live!...and a time to die!...\\"), resplendent with an awesome change in tempo.  Glorious intro, too, with that rumbling bass and the hypnotic guitar work.  And \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" is another shining moment for Bruce.  I personally LOVE the way he sings the last part of the verses (\\"Time, it waits for no man...\\").  Another example of this guy's unbelievable ability.   <br /> <br />I love Sabbath, Metallica, Priest, and all the other classic metal bands.  But believe me, they have nothing on Maiden.  Nothing.  Buy this masterpiece now.

I ALSO CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HE HAD GAVE BLANCHE BUS TICKETS TO GO HOME FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THAT WAS COLD BLOODED. BUT OVERALL THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE THESE PEOPLE PLAYED THESE ROLES WITH ALL OF THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS.
B00005JN4O|4.0|'Finding Neverland' is a fictionalized account of play-write J.M. Barrie's inspirations that would result in possibly his most famous work, 'Peter Pan.'  This inspiration is the Llewelyn Davies family, composed of the widowed Sylvia (Kate Winslet), her cynical mother (Julie Christie), and her four boys, including the \\"young adult\\" Peter (Freddie Highmore), increasingly apathetic and depressed following his father's death.  The story is one of magic, as is the film.  However, despite the opportunity for more interesting subject matter, director Mark Forster's new film feels quite processed; one can tell the cheese-loving Miramax produces.  There are no difficulties, nothing challenges the audience; even the performances given by an appropriately softened Depp and the disappointingly plain (it's not like she was given much to work with) Kate Winslet seem to settle at one horizon and cease to expand upon their respective characters or develop nuance.  But despite its short-comings, 'Finding Neverland' is an often-times endearing piece of work, proving perfect in production value; there are even delicious supporting roles that seem to exist only to spice up the screen with the likes of Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman, both doing well with small, underwritten roles.  The highlight of the film, though, is young Freddie Highmore, who, despite his young age, manages to fully emote and elicit honest emotional response (in a key break-down scene, Highmore nearly had me in tears).  He, among other reasons, will draw many to the film (I expect 'Neverland' to rank high on weekend box office charts).  Mark Forster sets the film at a generously even pace, so 'Neverland' will keep its audience awake.  But the screenplay falls short of making its themes of imagination vs. cynicism entirely convincing, as there is lack of character development throughout, and many adults herein feel much too black-and-white during a rather quick group transition from stern to jovial.  Though I recommend 'Neverland' to some, I am still a bit reserved as many may be disappointed in its lack of intense feel-good moments and \\"inspirational\\" schmaltz.  Unlike the play 'Peter Pan' itself, Forster's own Neverland is too simple and restricted to be entirely moving.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Aside that this \\"original\\" filmmaking was a knockoff of Memento's directing this is a pretty cool movie.<br /><br />The movie disturbing violence as others reviewers refer to was not too disturbing, with all the other movies coming out this days.  The shock value isn't as great as when I first watched \\"Faces of death\\" or other recent release, \\"Love Object.\\"<br /><br />Europeans' filmmakers really capture the essences of modern society's problems where Hollywood seems to stupefy things.  The independent low budget film has an edge to it.  Like another reviewer noted, the camera angle was very unstable.  I also felt dizzy for the first 5-10 minutes if it lasted any longer, I would have to turn it off.  (I got slight stigma in one eye and also can't play 3rd person video games)  The pictures' quality is almost all dark scenes and not very details due to the poor lightings and jumpy cameraman.  The acting is very creditable and scenes are provocative.<br /><br /> Directing wise it takes Memento's directing style by taking scenes chronically later in the story line and splicing it backward toward the beginning.  I am not going to give away the plots of either movie to explain how they did it.  \\"Irreversible,\\" simply reassure the world is far from perfect.
B000002JS0|4.0|This is a great album, the first track is very good \\"It's long way to the top if you wanna rock'n roll\\", it's great, I recommend you to listen this album, you'll love it. It is incredibly powerful, and agressive with the classic style of the old AC/DC. <br />Good luck <br />Ivan
0800141601|5.0|This is one of Sean Connery's great films. Jula Ormond never was better and Richard Gere was in top form.  All my children love this movie and this is one film my daughter wants to see with me over and over. It is just a perfect blend of romance and action with the emphasis on romance.  It also is about justice and natural rights. Good versus evil.  It is also a very Christian film though this is not emphasized and the figures of Christ and Mary are very remote in the dark church scenes. But in the final battle sequence the chorus is in LATIN and clearly they sing GOD IS THE LORD (DOMINUS DEUS).  This is not a dumb movie.  The twist of Lancelot finally getting the girl is nice.  Why not? All the stories are ficitonal anyway. Arthur may have been historical but Lancelot was a fictional additional to the old legend.<br /><br />But the point is this is a film which promotes good values, democratic values, and even moral values...it is clear that adultery is wrong....<br /><br />My children boys and girls all loved this film and want to see it again and again.  In doing so I have fallen in love with the flim too.  This film has many virtues and the chief among them is that it is rattling good entertainment!

B000002MNL|4.0|this was the second complete album by Morrissey that I'd ever listened to.  it's very different than \\"You Are the Quarry\\" (2004) which I like a tad better, but both are essential Moz. <br /> <br />after the skewering he got after \\"Kill Uncle\\" and the critical acclaim of \\"Your Arsenal\\" - Morrissey needed to keep the momentum.  luckily, he delivers the goods with this beautiful group of songs.  \\"The More You Ignore Me...\\" was a hit single that should be in your mind's landscape, and the fragility of \\"Now My Heart is Full\\" and \\"Speedway\\" should not be missed either.

0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is the story of a medieval man stuck in modern New Orleans.  The adventures of Ignatius J. Reilly are exaggerated and absurd, yet the overall feeling of the story is melancholy.  Ignatius' failure to succeed in this world forms the foundation of the novel, and the comedy surrounding this failure leaves a picture that is humorous but depressing.   <br />Toole's writing is of a virtuoso quality, his writing is easy to understand and incredibly clear-it is as if a camera were following the characters through their absurd situations. <br />The other strong point of the novel is the originality of its premise.  Though Ignatius may be a throwback to Quixote, he is a completely original personality, with his own set of mannerisms, phrases, and ideas.  By the end of the novel the reader will know everything there is to know about him.  The other characters are also very original.  Mancuso-the costume donning policeman, Robichaux-the old man who fears communists, Jones-the street-smart black man working at the Night of Joy.  All of these characters have their own trademark speech patterns and phrases, which makes them more realistic. <br />The main problem in the book is the lack of any significant plot progression or character development.  Though the characters are all interesting, they never change.  They stick to their initial personalities for the entire story.  Nothing really happens in the book, Ignatius gets a job, loses it, not much changes.  The only continual change is Ignatius' declining health.  The order in which Ignatius gets/loses jobs could easily be reversed with little change to the story.  This lack of a plot becomes very noticeable about half way through the book, and the story becomes  repititious. <br />This repitition is okay if you like the type of humor in the novel.  I believe this is the reason for the huge differences in opinion regarding this novel.  If you enjoy hearing of Ignatius' valve or his tirades on the lack of taste/theology/geometry of our society, then you will thoroughly enjoy the book.  If Ignatius annoys or disgusts you, the book will become extremely dull.   <br />This book is an excellent work of comedy, from there it's just a matter of taste. <br />
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|This is a great collection of what was one of the greatest concerts put together since the original Woodstock.  in fact, what Woodstock was for the end of the sixties, is what Live Aid was for the mid-eighties.  Then, of course, there was Lalapalooza, in the 90's. <br />But, I can't get over the bad reviews from regular folks bashing a DVD without viewing it yet.  Yes, I mean that, how can people say bad things without actually viewing it?  It wasn't released to the public yet, so don't believe what you read when these folks were probably just bashing it without viewing it (like most critics, no?)  Anyway, I viewed it from Japan, and it is great.  Of course, they can't get all the footage in, and they probably didn't want too.  Cutting six hours from an enormously large concert, covering Europe and America, isn't so bad.  Sure, I missed seeing the Led Zeppelin reunion, minus the late departed John Bonham (but Phil Colins filled the bill, as he did for most of the performers), but I heard it on the radio at the time, so I am glad I didn't see the visual, because like music, it is best listened to.  I recommend seeing it at a friends, or wait for it on pay per view TV, or cable or something before you buy it, or, if you think 6 hours of music is enough (can imagine if they did include the additional six hours!!), buy it.  You will not be disappointed.
B000059HAI|5.0|If you viewed the recent \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" which makes the attack a backdrop to a romantic love triangle, you won't be disappointed with this original version of the dastardly Japanese sneak attack on the American Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. I had the immense good fortune to see it again with some survivors after revisiting the Arizona Memorial in my hometown of Honolulu. It registered with me as deeply as when it premiered 35 years ago. You will find in this film a concerted effort to faithfully re-chronicle the events leading up to the attack from both the Japanese and American sides. Lacking film stars, the historical tale is allowed to stand on its own with some roles played by actors who actually resemble their real-life counterparts. Moreover, the film included actual aircraft and facilities from that era rather than relying on models or replicas. It avoids the dry documentary style while unfolding disparate events in an easy-to-follow sequence. The attack through the beautiful mountain ridge along the west coast of O'ahu (over what is now Scofield Barracks) is accurately depicted (an area, incidentally, now off-limits to civilians) and enhances the sense of brutal shock of it all on what would have been just another tranquil Sunday morning in paradise. Yet the directors resist the tawdry temptation to overdramatize events, instead allowing the diplomatic intrigue and military planning to speak for themselves. In doing so, the directors enable Admirial Yamamoto's prophetic words at film's end to have a greater impact, serving as a sober reminder of how Japanese jingoism subdued better strategic reasoning. [P.S. this was the not the first attack on American soil since the Revolutionary War, as an official reviewer with obviously limited historical understanding noted].
B00001U0DP|5.0|I put off watching this movie until today because I was afraid of being upset.  It's an excellent movie.  It doesn't burn going down.
0393035158|5.0|<br />Wonderful, interesting and enlightening. This is a very readable book about a subject that must be addressed. <br />We can no longer put our heads in the sand about the devastating effects of religious dogma. <br />Sam Harris is a courageous man with a very sharp mind. <br />
B0000025RI|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this is the all-time greatest album ever made! Mike broke the mold with this one. Every track on here is perfect, with a totally different style on each one. BABY BE MINE and THE LADY IN MY LIFE weren't released as singles (like the remaining seven), yet they are equally just as fine and masterful. If we could pick one person in this world with sheer musical talent, it would be Mike.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is truly the best album I've heard in the last five years.  It's been in my CD player for the last two weeks, and I can't take it out.  Every time I hear it, it is a little better.  It's unlike anything you've ever heard: mystical, magical, motivating, thought provoking, you name it.  If you care about music at all, this CD just might change your life.  It's a special experience, and proof that genious still exists somewhere in Canada. (First Broken Social Scene, now this...  Is there something in the water?!)
6300246787|5.0|Some people may not care for \\"Hello Dolly\\", but I think it is one of the greatest musicals of all time and is in my top ten list, if not my top five.  Barbra Stresisand is perfect as Dolly, bringing life and vitality to the character, as well as her beautiful singing voice.  Michael Crawford is excellent as Cornelius Hackl.  He's funny, charming and thoroughly believable.  Walter Matthau is great as a grumbling Horace Vandergelder.  Louis Armstrong adds his magic to the movie with his personality and his version of the title song.The costumes are wonderful, the scenery is too.  The music gets under your skin and is very catchy and can easily be sung along to.  I find this a idyllic idea of life at the turn of the century, a romantic view that all romantics would want to see.  If you enjoy Barbra Streisand, Walter Matthau, Michael Crawford, or just musicals in general this is a must see!
B000001EAQ|5.0|I have loved U2's music since I made Achtung Baby my first compact disc purchase, signaling the end of my cassette tape collecting days. Each U2 era offers something great, but the self-critical introspection of the 1990's was by far the most interesting. The band turned its keen, socially conscious eye inward, revealing a heart of darkness. What a departure - and a relief, especially for anyone that characterized the band as preachy. It was amazing to see such a radical change in subject matter, as U2's external, omnipresent optimism caved under the weight of internal ache.  <br /> <br />So Pop. This album has something that something that so many other U2 albums lack: explosive rock energy.  That energy was explored with tougher tones, new un-U2 song structures and some elements of electronic music. Yeah, there are loops and samples, but any band, particularly one with sustained success, should feel free to try pushing their musical envelope. This wasn't Dark Side or Sgt. Pepper but U2 absolutely used the studio as an instrument, complementing the band's tougher sound. As a result, this album is best experienced through headphones, which reveal outstanding subtleties tucked into the tunes on U2's best rock effort. <br /> <br />Headphone listens also reveal another crucial aspect of Pop: hard and dirty guitar. Up to \\"Achtung\\", listeners readily identified a U2 song by the church-bell chimes signature to Edge. On Pop, the Edge gets to convey emotion besides hope and optimism through his guitar. The layering and solos on Gone and Mofo will always sound as fresh, intense and desperate as the day they were committed to tape. With the 90's albums, Edge successfully added new colours and tones to his pallete. This alone makes the band's decade long departure an interesting one, and necessary to a future that would provide new & vital recordings.  <br /> <br />The bass and drums always add a sense of urgency to U2 songs (which Coldplay understand quite well) - here, Clayton and Mullen expand their musical repertoire, contributing new sounds and updating the U2 catalog with an homage to contemporary rock and dance music. Thanks to their rhythmic contributions, typical U2 urgency is translated into a party record about God, life/death, trash club culture, etc. Check Last Night on Earth here. <br /> <br />And despite borrowing from contemporary late `90's music, I think that this record has aged well. Just one song sounds like the time it was made:, Mofo, the only overtly electronica/techno tune of the bunch. Otherwise, Do You Feel Loved and Gone sound like they could have been made in 2005, U2 fast forwarding to the future of rock and roll. <br /> <br />The follow up disc is the anti-Pop and suffers because of it. While All that You Can't does offer some really pleasant songs, it lacks guts of any kind, instead choosing to reveal in some great, but formulaic aspects of U2. Uplifting choruses, trebly/chiming guitars, and Bono's crystal clear vocals pushed to the top of the mix like a diva. That's all been done before with great success, but here it is so safe, so adult contemporary.  <br /> <br />Look, my mom and I can agree on All that You Can't, but every time \\"Pop\\" is on, she insists that I turn it off because it gives her a headache. I don't want to listen to the same music as my mother, so thanks, Mofo. Rock and roll should be young, tough and rebellious - not your typical parental cup of tea. Even Elevation, the most rock moment of the record, is a bit soft. It was great to see U2 reclaim its place at the top of the rock world in 2001, but I begged that they wouldn't age with a whimper, becoming the new millennium equivalent of \\"A.M. Gold.\\"  <br /> <br />Fortunately, after a few listens to Atomic Bomb in advance, my fears have been put to rest because there is some rock on the disc. I believe U2 can still create beautiful and cutting edge music that ROCKS. Just listen to Love and Peace or Else and decide for yourself if the newest U2 is tough enough.  <br /> <br />Now U2 might not revel in the harder side of rock, but sometimes they explore it with great success. Check out Zoo TV era Bullet the Blue Sky, for example, where they pump 1.21 gigawatts of rock n' roll electricity into the tune. Pop is a record where U2 did some more successful exploring into ROCK. If that piques your interest, I suggest you check it out. Ignore the underwhelming reviews from those folks who just want U2 to do U2 (many of whom probably didn't even listen to the record), and I am certain you will be pleasantly surprised. <br />
B0000026WD|4.0|Not a bad album, considering Quincy was no longer in the producer's chair. If he had been, I think Michael would have possibly reached NEWER heights. Nonetheless, Teddy Riley did a nice job with Michael. A few of the songs didn't really thrill me such as ALL of the ones from OTW, THRILLER, and BAD. Michael still managed to release a slew of hits from the album, most notably JAM (an awesome track), IN THE CLOSET, REMEMBER THE TIME, HEAL THE WORLD, WILL YOU BE THERE, BLACK OR WHITE, WHO IS IT (another great song). The title track is a definite winner as well. For any fans of Mike, you should definitely have this one. Otherwise, the album is worth purchasing.
006054094X|4.0|I found \\"1421\\" by Gavin Menzies to be just a fascinating read, well worth the purchase and time, and the hypothesis put forth in the book very novel and if true, very enlightening.  Of course, the proof or not for the hypothesis, although there is quite a lot of  evidence cited in the book (and at the related web-site, [...] ), remains to be seen.  As with any theory the proof is in further examination and further exploration for supporting evidence.  It will be interesting to see, for example, how the DNA evidence ultimately comes out.  And the archeology of ancient wood wrecks probably has to develop just a bit more before it can identify definitively post-rot where the wreck came from.<br /><br />But still, Gavin has done in many ways a service to American (and world) history by advocating that America was found in 1421 (-3?) by Chinese explorers from the Zheng He Treasure Fleets.  He does so based mainly on maps that pre-date explorer journeys that should have in theory been the first discovery, something that does argue pretty well for \\"somebody\\" having been there ahead of Columbus, Magellen, et al.  The jump from there to Chinese Treasure Fleets is a bit tenuous, complicated of course by China having gone through one of its cultural purges, not unique to the country, but I'm sure aggravating for Chinese historians.  Could the data on the maps come from some other source?  Is Gavin Menzies' jump to the conclusion that it must have been the Chinese on solid ground?  That's a tough one.  Obviously there is a lot of evidence arguing that a number of cultures came to America before Columbus.  Aside from the pretty much accepted Vikings, there's also some conjecture that any number of further cultures came over earlier.  For example:<br /><br />Basques:  See \\"The Basque History of the World\\" by Mark Kurlansky.  This is a very well written, fascinating read, that spends some time putting forth the theory that the Basques went to North America, and kind of kept things \\"secret\\" to preserve essentially a trade advantage.  This is the best written book in this review.  It is perhaps a smaller jump to have the hypothesis that some of the early map details could have come from the Basques, who while secretive, may have let a map or two slip into Italian or Spanish hands.<br /><br />And of course there are other books and other theories.  Africans, Celts, Irish monks, Arab traders, etc., etc.  There seems to at least be a theory for many ancient civilizations as to how they may have gotten to America.  Could some of these have provided the information on the early maps?  Perhaps.<br /><br />But I do think that Gavin Menzies in his book does provide a lot of evidence that the Chinese in some form or other were in the Americas.  Was it in 1421?  That one is tough to conclude, although I am not saying Gavin Menzies is wrong in his hypothesis.  Even though an amateur, his practical experience at sea is such that he may put together things that classically trained historians and archeologists, mostly land-based, might miss initially.<br /><br />One book that is worthwhile reading for the discussion is \\"When China Ruled the Seas:  The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1405-1433\\" which explores much of the same territory as \\"1421\\", but is probably on less conjectural ground.  The history here is more directly supportable.  But still, there are gaps.  It would be very nice if some of the Chinese scholars or others could find much more solid information on the ships in the Treasure Fleet. There remain a lot of questions.  How were Wood ships constructed to be so large?  How sea-worthy were they for long voyages?  And so on.<br /><br />In the end, I think \\"1421\\" is the better read, well worth the effort.  I would suggest also wading through the footnotes, which while not quite up to classical historical text standards, at least do give some scope and context for the regular part of the book.  I doubt very much that the Chinese/American earlycontact references will be entirely disproved.  It does seem rather Euro-centric to conclude that the only post-land bridge discoverers of America came from there  Is Gavin Menzies correct that among those were the Chinese in 1421?  Read the book yourself and decide for yourself..se/American early contact references will be entirely disproved.

B0002XDODU|3.0|This album tries to show off Rammstein's softer side. I am not impressed. Sure it has about four good songs (the title track is probably the best), but thats it. Rammstein seems to know it too, since they have already dropped two of the tracks from this album from their setlist. \\"Amour\\" has to be one of the worst songs I have ever heard.    To top it off, Metallica's \\"St.Anger\\" was used as a template for this album. Yes, the album dubbed \\"the biggest letdown of 2003\\" and the worst selling Metallica album of all time was used as a guide for \\"Reise Reise.\\" The annoying ringing snare appears in several songs, Lindemann veers off key in Morgenstern, almost as bad as Hetfield. They also tried to match the guitar sound in a few songs, and the result speaks for itself.    The hard sound, from the previous three albums, and the mini-Kirk Hammett like solos from herzeleid and mutter are gone. Wait for their next album and see if they get back on top.    EDIT: Big Bad Wolf I enjoy your painfully long-winded, yet somehow humorous reviews.
B0002858YS|5.0|It truly is a miracle. Combining the styles of the eighties synth rock era (U2, Blondie, The Jam, etc) with the alternative rock culture of the 90's, The Killers have put out the most encouraging sign in a number of years that rock is still alive. In the spirit of two of rock's most prominent and important bands, Radiohead and The Strokes, The Killers give another angle to look at what has become alternative music. The production style is really what makes this such a great record. While rock is becoming less and less a mainstream comodity, The Killers use pop-like backings with fantastic and haunting guitar fills behind charismatic vocals. The lyrics are very mediocre and posses no real content for the most part, but the emphasis of the music is on the vocals and synth-style backgrounds. Unlike pop-punk bands who have taken rock music and pushed it towards pop, the Killers have taken raw elements of pop and combined them with alternative rock. A fantastic record that is exciting and new. It will spawn great things, including more albums from the Killers. This could very well be a turning point in the progression of rock; when you look at the alternative scene, it is all becoming more and more pop, while retaining its alternative feel. If this is any implication, there is a new renaissance of rock on the way. And the Killers will be one of the bands blazing the trail.
6305513406|5.0|Although it's more silent in audio nature than the rest of the eps that followed, WNHGB is exciting, well-acted, interesting and powerful. Shatner is excellent and memorable in his first outing as Kirk. But as big a fan as I am of him the ep really belongs to the guest characters of ESP mutants Mitchell and Dehner (Gary Lockwood and Sally Kellerman). They are so dead on perfect in their roles it's a pity we never got to see either of them again on TOS. The rest of the crew (cast) doesn't have much to do. I feel bad we didn't get anymore of comely Andrea Dromm as Yoeman Smith on TOS either. But can't have EVERYTHING.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I was very excited when I first heard about this band's inception.  I am a big fan of both bands.  Chris Cornell is, without a doubt, one of the greatest rock singers ever.  Rage Against the Machine had one of the best rhythm sections I have ever heard.  It seemed like a marriage made in heaven.    Well, it's a damned good rock record, but the marriage is a little rockier than I expected.  Sometimes, it works beautifully, ie \\"Cochise,\\" \\"Gasoline,\\" \\"Like a Stone.\\"  Other songs, like \\"I am the Highway,\\" \\"What You Are,\\" and \\"Hypnotize,\\" fall short of rock greatness.    All in all, it's a great record that doesn't quite meet expectations.  I'd still rather listen to Badmotorfinger or Evil Empire.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I went to see this movie today with family members.  I have never seen a more entertaining, exciting, magical and enchanting movie.  The children all around me seemed completely enthralled and I heard other adults sitting close by saying \\"Isn't this great?\\" I've seen references to it having some scary scenes, but I heartily disagree.  Pleasantly thrilling - yes, but scary? not at all. The whole experience was an absolute joy and most decidedly Christmas entertainment at its finest.  When we arrived, the first showing was sold out.  After much deliberation, we all agreed to change our plans for the day and go back for the later showing. We were so glad we did.  Kudos to Mr. Hanks and Mr. Zemekis......this was wondrous, indeed!!
B000056N8X|5.0|It was good to see that the Highlander series was back on track. After Highlander 2, no one thought they could bring it back. Highlander 3 sorta got noticed but wasn't a great movie, it was more of a remake. But Endgame was brilliant, it has revived the series by setting up another sequel that sould be out in 2005 or 2006. But what's so great about the film you ask? Well the shots and direction were spectacular. The choreographing  done by Donnie Yen, who also starred in it, was incredible. And the story for once was original and the acting quite good. Bruce Payne made a great villian and Adrian Paul was a great new lead role for the series.(luckly he will be returning for number 5) I would recomend this film to any fantasy or Highlander fan.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with this movie.  This new director took SO many liberties with rearranging and creating the storyline, I hardly recognized the movie.  I still cannot believe the author allowed this movie to be created in such a way.  Every true Harry Potter fan I have ever spoken with has expressed the same dismay.  I will get the DVD only because I want to add it to my Harry Potter collection.  However, I hope very much that the next movie will be made consisent with the book!  I don't care if the movie is 3+ hours long if it stays true to the story.
2707306959|5.0|With such intimate tone Marguerite Duras involves us in the story of her childhood. She, daughter of a poor French family in the colonies (South East Asia) has her first romantic experience with a rich Chinese man.    Class, gender, ethnicity, uprootedness, relationships, all of that mingles to create a narrative that flows full of power and feeling. Both the nameless narratrice and her lover are outsiders in a country that is not really theirs, both share a moment and both have complex lives.    I think anyone who has grown in a home full of conflicts and privations can easily identify with the feelings so passionately set to paper by the author. And anyone else can, too: such is the magic of her prose.    The ditions de Minuit series is rather minimalistic: no prologue, no notes. None are needed.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a heartbreaking and uplifting read from new novelist, Alice Sebold. The reader is immediately sucked into the life and afterlife of Susie Salmon, a fourteen-year-old murder victim. Through Susie's eyes, the reader is able to observe the life of her family and friends after the tragedy and watch as they mature and continue with their lives. Her life before and after her death was entertaining and somber to read and the characters were well developed. Susie herself is very likeable and I couldn't help but feel for her as she longed for the life of the living, though Susie, her killer and the reader know her life on Earth is over.     While some portions of the book may seem over the top, nonetheless the novel is surreal and unforgettable. What's more, the ending may seem too perfect to some but it absolutely works for this book and you would not want the story to end in any other way.

B0001Z37HM|4.0|If you like swords fights, Muscles,and warriors at it's best then you'll like to watch this film.&#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; If you're looking for more &quot;acting kind of stuff&quot; you can watch Bridget Jones Diary.&#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; Arnold can look like a robot or a Kindergarde teacher or a man from 2000 years if he wanted to, we all know that. this movie is from 1985  so it may not have the same effects that we see these days but It was meant to be an old flick anyway, IN the dvd version the sound It's terrific, a must have specially if you have kids or If you're an Arnold fan!!!&#60;br /&#62; the story is plain and simple but everyhting looks real and Arnold is in his own surroundigns unlike the Rock who was more like an showing off in Scorpion King.&#60;br /&#62; Everything looks real(from that era) if you get in to the story.&#60;br /&#62; Again you got to love those swords man they are real Briggitte did a good work also!!!&#60;br /&#62;

B00030590I|5.0|I saw \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and thought this movie (\\"Hero\\") would be something between that and \\"Kill Bill\\".  I was pleasantly supprised at the originality and plot twists of this movie, along with the wonderful music and fluidity of the story.  Anyone who likes Jet Li but maybe didn't like \\"Romeo Must Die\\" needs to see this movie to help reinstate Jet Li as the modern day martial arts #1 actor. I'm glad that this movie is coming out on DVD before Christmas. I've been wanting to see again almost every day since I saw it last.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Don't listen to the cynics here. We are lucky to have this AT ALL. It was never supposed to be released because Bob Geldof wanted it to be a once in a lifetime experience, living on in the collective memory. What a shame that would have been for current and future generations. The proliferation of bootleg copies changed his mind, but the tapes were found after they had almost given up. I think the price was kept low so more people would buy it, and anyone who complains or puts forth ridiculous \\"conspiracy\\" theories about what is being kept from us is just nuts. For the price, it is phenomenal. The quality is better than I actually expected after reading some of these reviews. <br /> <br />If you want every minute of every performance at Live Aid, don't buy this set. If you want great performances by some of the biggest musicians of the 80's all in one place, buy it and marvel at the accomplishment while waxing nostalgic(for those over 35 or so).
B0002XDODU|4.0|I didn't like this album at first but I really do now. I'm a huge heavy metal fan and I liked the other three albums so much because of the riffs and heavy edge. This album has some rockers but the style is more orchestral and focused on melody. I say they pulled it off. The acoustic guitar on \\"Los\\" was a fresh idea and it sounds awesome! Very rock N roll. The title track is the anthem song, with the violins and all...pretty good. I thought America was pretty silly at first but its catchy in the weirdest way you know? The female russian vocals on Moskau adds another layer to the wall-of-sound that is Rammstein. Keine Lust is a heavy number and the video for this song is hilarious, the members of Rammstein  are all fat and jamming out...like obese! Kinda strange, but its not for me to know the meaning behind that. Overall, definitley not their best but I like it and its worth repeated listens, just like the other albums. Rammstein have proven they can make beautiful music as well as heavy. Great music.
B00068IOWM|5.0|WOW, I hate writing reviews but after watching the band perform on SNL, they are the greatest.  I'm a die hard SNL fan, and this is the best performance ever.  \\"Sometimes..\\" came to life on stage even more than the great album version, Bono was stunning with his voice.  The show was running its credit and they played \\"I will Follow\\", the whole audience was in awe, even the cast members were loving it, one of them teared up.  THANK YOU U2, YOU ARE THE BEST FELLAS!!!
B0006284JQ|5.0|Britney is one of the most underrated artists in recent years. She sells millions of albums and has some of the biggest hits in recent years yet she doesn't get the respect she deserves. Right now is the perfect time for a greatest hits collection because she is probably at the lowest point she has ever been publicity wise. She needs an album like this to remind people what all the fuss is about. <br /> <br />Even if you own all her albums like I do, there are plenty of reasons to buy this CD. There are 3 songs that have never been released before (My Prerogative, I've Just Begun Having My Fun, Do Something) and several remixes that were previously available only on soundtracks (You Drive Me Crazy, Boys, Overprotected). While those songs are all good, the real reason to get this album is to hear all the Britney greats on one CD. The songs aren't listed in chronological order which makes it interesting to hear how well they all fit together. To me the biggest surprise was I'm a Slave 4 U. I always did like that song but here it sounds even better than it did before because all the controversy surrounding that song has died down. The other surprising aspect of this CD is how well most of the songs have aged. Baby One More Time and Oop!...I Did It Again still sound amazing, even though songs like Lucky and Sometimes have weakened with age. She also tends to favor her more recent work, which I am glad she did because her last CD was excellent in my opinion. Toxic is probably one of the best singles of the year and helped Britney top the charts once again. <br /> <br />Overall I would highly recommend this CD. Britney may not be the strongest singer and her lyrics may not be what most would consider deep, but she makes excellent, fun, upbeat pop music. Some may think it's too soon for a greatest hits album, but Britney has accomplished a lot in the past 5 years. Even though right now she is going through a tough time publicity wise, I don't think she should be counted out just yet. Britney has a few more tricks up her sleeve and I can't wait to find out what they are. Until then, I have this great Cd to listen to.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I enjoyed the edge of reason because I love Colin Firth.  It had some moving moments about relationships.  Not quite as good as original but the edge of reason book wasn't as good either so I think the movie lived up to the book but better.  I would see any movie Colin Firth was in.
B000667FN8|5.0|I really love this cd... if u don't have it and ur a fan go get it... Support the Band.  All the songs are  really good and perfect world is one of my personal favs.  The band kicks and they deserve to sell lots of albums.  This cd is definatley a step of the there old cd but not in a bad way i still love no pads.... but this ones just different but still really good<br /><br />Hope u go buy it...<br /><br />DD
B0002XH9Z4|1.0|I beg for money please....    Oh well, Michael Jackson released too many compilation of his songs that is considered to be sell out these days.  I don't mean be too personal about Jacko, but face the truth, Michael needs money and he just needs money to compensate all his debts.  What's the point of buying again the same stuffs you already have????  In addition, this compilation is too expensive.  $[...] price, you could buy around four to five different artists' CD.  SAVE YOUR MONEY....
0141439661|5.0|Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. It's a very entertaining book. A few pages into this book, I already had taken sides for and against the characters. They are wonderfully believable. Some I disliked; some I liked. The ones I didn't like were money grubbing types who must have been pretty common in that period. The one I most liked was Elinor Dashwood, the eldest Miss Dashwood. She was very pretty and had good sense. Throughout the book, I found surprises. These were unexpected events that twisted the plot. Jane Austen uses the English language very well. This book is almost contemporary in language and is eminently readable. In fact, Sense and Sensibility is a classic worth owning.<br /><br />  I recommend Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility to all readers who want a fascinating cast of characters and a good read.

B0004Z33EG|4.0|\\"You trained me. You made me. You kill me.\\" - Rambo goes off the deep-end in the original ending to \\"First Blood\\"<br /><br />I will always give four stars to \\"First Blood\\" (hence, the 4 star rating above), but with this third DVD release of the film from \\"Lions Gate Home Video\\", die-hard fans should only pick this up for the so called legendary & \\"lost\\" original ending (it didn't show up on the \\"Special Edition\\" because the footage couldn't be located in time)& thats after if you can't find the footage to download from the internet or some other source.<br /><br />I got an advanced copy of \\"First Blood\\" Ultimate Edition this week (the streetdate is 11/23/04), & was psyched to see what was in store on this DVD. But, after watching all the special features I couldn't help but feel like I had opened a huge Christmas Gift & finding only a flaming paper bag of dog crap to put out.<br /><br />The film itself is identical to the \\"S.E.\\" version with \\"First Blood\\" in the widescreen format with 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 surround. The audio commentary by Sylvester Stallone is new & informative (where the hell was he for the \\"Special Edition\\" ?!?).<br /><br />The deleted scenes are what fans have always been clamoring for & the original ending hasn't been shown to audiences since the film's preview screenings in mid '82. The original ending was a bit weird to watch & a bit off with the film itself. Here is a marine who went through 2 tours of Vietnam, a P.O.W., and just beat the crap out of \\"Jerkwater, USA\\" only to commit suicide at the unwilling hands of his Colonel. Huh?! Decades ago I read the David Morrell novel of the same name and I always thought, & I could be mistaken, that Rambo gave Trautman an ultimatum - kill or be killed. If Trautman didn't kill Rambo first, than Rambo would attack Trautman, leaving the Colonel with the only alternative but to kill Rambo.<br /><br />The other deleted scene has to do with a flashback sequence Rambo has while eating his boar meat in the cave. the scene is simple enough, in Saigon, Rambo picks up an Asian hooker & makes love to her (Suzee Pai, who was Miao Yin, the girl with the green eyes, in the Kurt Russell film \\"Big Trouble In Little China\\", plays the hooker). The scene was cut becuase it slowed the movie down to a crawl and killed the pacing of the film (at the end of this scene Stallone is shown crying and I couldn't help but wonder if his character is having a breakdown or if Stallone is crying because he just watched one of the most embarassing moments of his career).<br /><br />The last deleted scene is a blooper take of the original ending, with Rambo telling Trautman to shoot him & after a long pause, with the take botched, Rambo says, \\"Thanks a million.\\", with Trautman shrugging his shoulders & replying, \\"O.K.\\" (its worth the chuckle).<br /><br />As for the rest of the DVD, I wasn't impressed at all. Its a barebones affair with no trailers, or documentaries at all (\\"Special Edition\\", anyone?). The \\"Survival Mode\\" feature sucks & was, actually, quite annoying. The briefing & tracking location features were lame and the other survival features could have been used as a trivia track that could run at the bottom of the screen while watching the film. The menus aren't interactive and look as if they were put together rather quickly. Pre-schoolers could have done a better job.<br /><br />Ultimately the decision on whether to own this is up to you, the viewer.<br /><br />Is this the final DVD release of \\"First Blood\\"?<br /><br />Just remember what Rambo said near the end of the film.<br /><br />\\"Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off!\\"<br /><br />You tell'em John J.ar meat in the cave. the scene is simple enough, in Saigon, Rambo picks up an Asian hooker & makes love to her (Suzee Pai, who was Miao Yin, the girl with the green eyes, in the Kurt Russell film \\"Big Trouble In Little China\\", plays the hooker).

B0000009S3|4.0|I've owned literally thousands of recordings from the 70's to the present and I had somehow never managed to pick up a single one of Zappa's roughly 8000 albums.  I guess that formidable discography is intimidating to the uninitiated, and I never found his humor very, well, humorous.  Still I had always heard that he had some killer instrumental records and that this was the best one.<br /><br />So I finally got around to it and was pleasantly surprised.  \\"Peaches en Regalia' and \\"Son of Mr Green Genes\\" alone are entirely worth the price of admission.  In fact, that final run-through of \\"Green Genes\\" is one of the most transcendental moments I've ever heard in rock history.  Gives me goose-bumps every time.  The rest of Hot Rats isn't at that level, but ain't half bad either.  I like Beefheart too, so his appearance doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I really liked this.  If you're into adventurous fusion-y stuff but are afraid of this because it's Zappa, try it.  I'm glad I did.
B000003TA4|5.0|beatles, zeppelin, who, doors, sabbath, and hendrix are nothing compared to the great Nirvana. Music before this was about long boring guitar solos, puffy hairsprayed hair, and high pitched vocals. This cd is mostly about beautiful melodies and emotional lyrics.  Kurt Cobain has to be the best guitarist of all time.
B00024BHTC|1.0|First track, bum, bum, bum. bum, yip! yip! yip!.  How can anybody say this band is fantastic?  They are total and utter crap!!!!!  I can only describe this as [...] nerd music for lonely teens. Buy this at your peril!!!!!
B000022TSW|5.0|This is by far the best movie ever. Everything is good: the songs,the jokes, the animation, and even the spoofing. If you have not seen this film then you are just another person. But if you have, then you're one of us. One of the million people out there in the world that are fortunate enough to see this movie. I rented it just to see what it was like and the first five minutes blew me away. I've never ever in my entire life laughed as hard as i did when i first saw this movie. My favorite song is \\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\\". and my second is \\"Mountain Town\\". I like when they show the terrance and phillip movie. I learned so many new insults and jokes tis not even funny. I can't wait for a sequel. I watch the show but i have only seen a few episodes but the movie is better then them all!!!! If you don't like this movie then you musta been stoned when you watched it because i showed it to my mom and even she was cracking up. Trey Parker is the coolest person on the face of the earth aside from Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson. I hope you make the right discision and watch this film cuz tis phenominal.
B000286S8S|2.0|The track listings on this CD are crap.  Why couldn't they of released a seperate disc for the 2 worlds? Or is that they know if they had released a CD with just Van Hagar songs on it, it wouldn't of sold well?  Warner Brothers should release the best of Dave Lee Roth with the best guitar tracks from the early Van Halen years through to Steve Vai and Jason Becker. Also back to the compilation, why are there too many tracks missing? whatabout more from Fair Warning like Dirty Movies? Or Sinner's Swing? etc etc.  Where's Spanish Fly? I couldn't recommend buying this because its aggravating to listen to, as DLR once said 'I want my cake and I want it all, or I don't want at all'!!!
B0002YLC24|1.0|actually wrote the review for the soundtrack by mistake, disliked the movie so much that i am re-writing it here for dvd. do you like walking and talking and trying to fake a conversation...? i don't and i really don't want to watch two other people who are faking that activity and faking it badly.  this one is a t-u-r-d, turd. you get to see paris since they only go for a walk, you wish theyed just jump one another so you could start wathcing the other movie you rented before you completely waste saturday night. if i am wrong, let me know, maybe i will re-watch it, then again like i said in the first review of the soundtack, i'd rather jump in lake michigan in november.
0802130208|4.0|Confederacy Of Dunces kept me laughing the entire novel. Ignatius may be the funniest character I have ever encountered reading a book. He seems to be made for a movie. Too bad John Kennedy Toole couldnt stay alive to capatilize on that opportunity.  <br /> <br />My favorite characteristic about Ignatius was the constant referal to his troublsome valve. His continual weirdness and stuborness make this novel funny.  <br /> <br />The plot is slow, but like most comedies it is not important. The characters are what makes this novel interesting. I highly recommend reading it.
B0000025T6|5.0|It begins with a detached spareness in \\"Nebraska,\\" a song that echoes Terrence Mallick's Badlands with eerie chill, and becomes an entire album of that spareness.  Armed with just an acoustic guitar, Springsteen sings as a host of characters driven to total desparation in a system that locks them out financially and emotionally.  Things go unanswered here - the place where \\"sins lie unatoned\\" in \\"My Father's House,\\" the simple yearning to \\"never drive in no used car again\\" in \\"Used Cars.\\"  Some may find it bleak, but Nebraska has an emotional vividness that far surpasses any exploitatoin - every life here is felt and glorified for its humanity in the face of standards it can't meet.  And production values or no, \\"Atlantic City\\" is one of the finest songs of Springsteen's career - a gripping portrait of how far any person would go to outrun their demons.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I recently got this movie, and I really liked it!!! I must say Hayao Miyazaki is a film making GENIUS. The art, the storyline, the characters... They were all awesome. <br /> <br /> If you own a DVD player(and most people do)GET THIS!!!! Trust me, you'll love it.
0743457900|5.0|<br />Tinker Tailor, the first installment of Le carre's Smiley-versus-the-world trilogy, is a unique, complex and intelligent novel about a suspected mole in the British intelligence (supposedly it is the MI6, but really the MI6 is just counter-intelligence. But never mind.) <br /> <br />Whoever dared to question Le Carre's ability at writing a fascinating a thrilling plot will be pleasantly surprised by a plot which is complicated and brilliant, to the point that you might want to start taking notes at some point to keep track of the staggering mass of characters and sub-stories.  <br />The narrative is built as layers upon layers of stories that unfold, and Le Carre cleverly weaves past, present and first body to propel the story told by various characters being interrogated with both thrill and compassion. The balance between characters and story development that often goes slightly too heavy to the former, is here right on the money.  <br /> <br />Le Carre's style and control of the language are superb. He has a rare ability to characterize the acting figures solely through dialogue. He treats the reader as intelligent, lets him thinks for himself regarding insights- he doesn't feed you with a spoon like many other authors. He portrays the character well enough however, that finally their motives become clear through it. Or so you would think... <br /> <br />In fact, the only bad thing I can say about his writing is that after reading everything else I try to read suddenly seems like a ridiculous teen comic book.  <br />
B000025XKM|5.0|I first heard of this album when I was living in Athens, Ohio at a friend's house. From the first song this is an album to the last this album will stand the test of time as being one of the best albums ever made for this troubled soul. <br /> <br />What makes it so great is that album is very raw. It's just Nick his guitar and a mike. Every once and awhile you hear a piano or other instrument but it's very sparse over all. On top of that because of how simple it is none of the songs are over produced trying to be made grander than what they are. You simply take this album at face value and enjoy it. To look into any hidden meaning would destroy the fun of interpreting the songs. <br /> <br />My favorite song on the album would be \\"Things Behind the Sun\\" the lyrics are beautiful and the music just washes over you with emotion. <br /> <br />On the lyrics side the lyrics are simple and to a great degree weave a short store. It is a clich to say it but each word seems carefully chosen. You can't help but hear the sorrow and depression in Nick Drakes voice and he tries to get out each word.  <br /> <br />This is an album to listen to when it's late and night and you're not ready for bed, but you want to end on a quite night. Just let the music and words wash over you. On top of that it transcends age. A friend of mine who in to heavy metal and 16 years old heard this album and was amazed at how melodic it was.  <br /> <br />It is a shame that he never was able to see how much of an impact his words and music have had on people. As a musician and poet I hope to some day come close to what Drake has done on this album.
0312319517|2.0|Bottom line first- A relatively good story fails to save this novel from horrible narration, lack of prose, no tangible characters, and a laconic technical style of writing that is unfit for publishing.    Mr. Forsyth, wake me up when you decide to replace editors. The first 168 pages (out of 350) are just a very prolonged exposition that goes forever about the histories of every character, with little or no actual plot development, ruining any chance of thrill or even interest. The style is quick, very dry and overly detailed.    The narration is at times overly elaborated and unliterary, going all over the place in the half-fiction half-fact style that is common for Forsyth, but this time fails to set the plot in motion. Everything- situations, characters, and motives, are all half-baked. The pacing for history and scenes crucial to the plot are the same.  The entire novel reads like some technical report, and as such manages to detach the reader. Nothing is written in the actual now of the story, the characters are virtually non-existent and there is almost no dialogue, and the result is there are no scenes that you can imagine, like in a normal novel.     Because of all this there is no suspense or thrill in this book, despite what some of the reviewers here maintain, and to the reviewer that praised the characterization in the book (?!?) I can only recommend reading any work by Le Carre, or previous works by Forsyth.    I know all this might seem like an overly artistic approach to review this novel, but believe you me, the style of this book is so bizarre that I personally found it impossible to get through it.    Too bad that a good intrigue story about the Bosnia war, an interesting life of a Vietnam tunnel rat, Anti-terrorism agents and cool gun-blazing vengeance in the dark jungles of south America are all ruined because the author decided to write a report instead of a novel.    A far cry from Forsyth's earlier works.
0064407667|4.0|One of literary devices used by the `writer' Lemony Snicket is explaining the difference between the literary and figurative meaning of a sentence or word. When he does that, he usually says that `in this sentence the word means this and that'. His novel is cool, and in this sentence this word means that it is funny, fast and interesting -- both to kids (early teens on) and adults.<br /><br />\\"The Bad Beginning\\" is the first book in his \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\". As the title spoils it is not a happy reading, and the writer is kind enough to advise readers in the first page, telling them that if they prefer they could go for another kind of book -- a happier one.<br /><br />Those who brave enough to go on may be a little surprised -- or not. Surprise is not the main quality of this short novel. But it doesn't come as a problem, as a matter of fact. The fun in this first book is actually seeing how the evil Count Olaf will try to steal the three Baudelaire orphans fortune and how they will escape from him.<br /><br />Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are three siblings who have a nice and wealthy life until the day their parents die in a terrible fire that destroyed their house. After that, they are force to live with Count Olaf, a distant relative, but the only one who lives in town. It turns out that the man is evil and has some kind of obsession with eyes -- he has images of eyes hanging everywhere in his house.<br /><br />He is an actor, and while his out the children are forced to do all the housework. The only friend they have is a neighbor called Justice Strauss. In the meantime, Count Olaf tries to come up with a plan to reach the siblings' money. And he has a perfect plan.<br /><br />Most of the fun of this little book comes from the narrator, Mr Snicket, rather than the narrative itself -- after all, it is a sad story and we're not supposed to laugh at other people's misfortunes, aren't we?<br /><br />It reads easily -- even for young readers -- the vocabulary is accessible, and so is the narrative. The characters are stereotypical but it is something common in books target for that audience.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter\\" fans may find some new reading material here. The story may be not as dark and `complex' and the little wizard's, but it is still a good adventure after all. Adventure in this sentence means something that will not put at the edge of your sit, but it won't be boring too.eaders -- the vocabulary is accessible, and so is the narrative.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|A lot can happen in six years, which is the length of time Canadian songstress Sarah McLachlan took off between her last album and her latest effort, Afterglow. During that period of time, she gave birth to her first daughter, and witnessed the death of her mother. The tracks on this studio release are a culmination of her feelings and emotions during the last few years. You would have thought that six years would have given fans something more exciting, but this isn't the case at all. <br /> <br />There is no doubt about it; Afterglow contains some stunning tracks. There's Stupid, an intense song about unrequited love, and the quiet piano ballad Push. Dirty Little Secret would not have been out of place on her last album, Surfacing, and the opening track Fallen is lovely. Sadly, the rest of the album is mere filler. Lyrically, the songs tackle similar topics, which would have been fine if there was a little more experimentation. McLachlan rarely deviates from her tried-and-tested formula. After awhile, the entire CD sounds like one long song, with simple, warm-sounding piano chords. If that's what you're looking for-- a simple background CD-- then this is perfect. However, if you're looking for something that's groundbreaking, then it's not here. I did want to like this album, but it was just too same-y for my liking.  <br /> <br />2.5 Stars, rounded up to 3.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you are new to Radiohead, maybe wondering if it's all hype?  Nope, it's the real deal.  This band infiltrates your mind as you listen, you gradually enter their world and you don't come out.  The effect is chronic and there is no cure.
B00005YW4H|4.0|There's a good, friendly, quiet, relaxed emotion in this music and that's really what I like about it.<br /><br />Some reviewers here have said, it's not \\"exciting\\" \\"jarring\\" and yeah, that's why I like it... I don't always feel like being jarred or excited.  One said \\"nice, but just doesn't say much\\"  Personally, I don't always wanna be told something either...  I'm quite glad when I get a break from all the overzealous people and their big messages...  I'm pleased when they don't overstack their music with (mostly contrived) excitement, when they don't try to convince me of their \\"brandnew\\" sort of wisdom.<br /><br />This music appeals to me because of what is there just as much as because what she leaves out.<br /><br />Some reviewer here panned the album, calling it boring, followed up with a recommendation to buy duran duran albums instead, pointing out how they go platinum within days of release.  I really had to laugh... that's a different genre of music.  If you're a metallica fan, sure, you might want to avoid this album, but for others, I think the tracks amazon lets us listen to here  speak for themselves.

As his jobs got more vicious and careless of bystanders, he wanted out. \\"Out,\\" he learned, meant dead, burned to death.<br /><br />That really made him mad.<br /><br />He is reincarnated as an agent of Hell, renamed \\"Spawn\\". After that, there is everything you would want in a comic book adaptation. He has a soft side for his former family, thirst for revenge, mysterious mentor, super powers he has not learned to control, an incredibly annoying liaison agent from the devil, and Martin Sheen as an over-the-top bad guy. And a small boy as a sidekick. Does that complete the checklist?<br /><br />Even though the nominal plot is a battle between heven and hell, fought on earth, there are no real religious overtones here (but you're free to read them in if you want). It's just wild characters, lots of fights, and passable effects. On the whole, a pretty good way to kill an evening.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD truly is amazing and it without a doubt, the best album of 2004. It's about time real punk music came back to what it is really about, rebellion. <br /> <br />I have always been a big fan of Green Day's music, yet this album seems to top them all. I'd recommend this album to most people.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|It should come as no surprise that Peter Weir's 2003 film \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" would come away from the Academy Awards with two Oscars after receiving ten Oscar nominations.  Though he did not win the Oscar for Best Director (that honor went to Peter Jackson for \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\"), Peter Weir has been nominated several times in the past for Best Director for the films \\"The Truman Show\\" (1998), \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" (1989) and \\"Witness\\" (1986). He also directed the films \\"The Year of Living Dangerously\\" (1982) and \\"Gallipoli\\" (1981), for which he won the prestigious Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Director. <br /> <br />\\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" was based upon the 1970 novel \\"Master and Commander\\", written by Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000).  The novel was the first in a series of 21 novels featuring the characters Captain Jack Aubrey (of the British Royal Navy) and his friend, the surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The final incomplete novel, which was only half-written at the time of Patrick O'Brian's death, \\"The Final, Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey\\", was published in 2004.  Having co-written the screenplay with John Collee, Peter Weir's film adaptation of \\"Master and Commander\\" begins onboard the British Naval warship christened HMS Surprise off the coast of Brazil circa 1805.  The ship's captain, Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (the superb actor Russell Crowe), is under orders to find and stop a Napoleonic French naval warship, christened the Acheron, from creating havoc in the Pacific Ocean.  Unable to see well due to foggy conditions, one of the ship's minor officers, the tragic Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby), momentarily catches a glimpse of an obscured object.  Alerting the ship, Captain Aubrey scours the horizon and sees bright flashes emanating from the fog.  Telling the crew the take cover, HMS Surprise is brutally attacked by the superior gun power of the Acheron.  Escaping into the fog, Captain Jack follows a course that takes the HMS Surprise around Cape Horn at the bottom tip of South America, then on a course that takes the beleaguered ship to the Galapagos Islands.  It is there that Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who is also a naturalist, takes a keen interest in the unusual species that inhabit the islands.  A Would-be Charles Darwin, Maturin wants to explore the islands, but Captain Aubrey's main interest is the pursuit of the Acheron.  However, an unfortunate gunfire accident encourages Captain Aubrey to return to the Galapagos Islands, which works out well for both his objectives and Maturin's naturalist hobby. <br /> <br />With exquisite cinematography (for which the film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography), exciting naval battles, good acting and an authentic portrayal of the early nineteenth-century, \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" is an excellent film that is well worth watching.  However, it does a have a few flaws, with the largest being the complete lack of character development for any of the French warship's crew.  Instead, the Acheron and its crew is depicted as being essentially a buccaneer ship of bad-guys with nothing known about them or their mission.  Other memorable characters in the film include 1st Lt. Tom Pullings (James D'Arcy), 2nd Lt. William Mowett (Edward Woodall), the very young Midshipman Blakeney (Mark Pirkis), his friend Midshipman Calamy (Max Benitz) and Coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, who played the Hobbit Pippin in all three \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films between 2001 and 2003).  Memorable scenes include the foggy naval battle, the trip around the Cape, the arrival at the Galapagos, the accident, the surgery, the island walk and the final climactic scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2003 \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This is a great documentary, but some of the information does not seem to work out well and Michael Moore seems to use things to pull you in. I am not saying this is terrible. I'd recommend this to most people. But when it comes down to it, there is a much better documentary that seems to be almost unheard of. It's titled \\"Hijacking Catastrophe.\\" It's a better documentary about George W. Bush and his administration because it seems to be more informative. If you don't like this one or something along those lines, or even if you did like \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", I'd recommend checking out \\"Hijacking Catastrophe.\\"
1400032717|4.0|What an interesting book! I wasn't sure I was going to like it at first, as the style is not something I am used to.  But the story line brings you in, and I found this to be such an interesting look into the life of a family through the simplicity and honesty of Christopher's mind.<br /><br />The book made me sad, happy, giggle, and finally proud with a touch of sorrow.<br /><br />Very well written interesting read, I highly recommend.
B000024D4R|5.0|When I first heard this CD,I had mixed feelings about what I was about to hear.But once I heard \\"Pigs On The Wing Pt.1\\" I was going to hear something just as good as Meddle,Wish You Were Here,and Darkside Of The Moon.It opens up with a the short \\"Pigs On the Wing Pt.1\\",which is a great acoustic song.Then the epic 17 minute epic \\"Dogs\\" starts.To me \\"Dogs\\" is the best song in the album,especially David Gilmour's Guitar playing.Then \\"Pigs(Three Different Ones)\\" follows.Its a great song about hate towards Roger Waters enemies and such.Then comes \\"Sheep\\".Even if others say bad things about the song,it is no less great.Even if some of the Lyrics are akward. <br /> <br />\\"When cometh the day we lowly ones <br /> Through quiet reflection <br /> And great dedication <br /> Master the art of karate(yes,lyrics about Sheep learning karate) <br /> Lo we shall rise up <br /> And then we'll make the buggers' eyes water\\" <br /> <br />The song finishes great though with great guitar riffs.Then the album finishes with Pt.2 of \\"Pigs In The Wing\\".Overall this album is great and is a Must-Buy for any Pink Floyd Fan. <br /> <br />Other Recomended Pink Floyd Albums include... <br />The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn <br />Meddle <br />Darkside Of The Moon <br />Wish You Were Here <br />The Wall
B0000C7PSW|5.0|So I jumped into this pretty quick. I have friends who have been listening to Rufus Wainwright for quite a while. I myself have had 2 or 3 of his songs on my computer from soundtracks I had purchased long ago. I adored them, but to my surprise, never ventured out to find more on this artist. Recently I have done just that. I can't even tell you why or how; these past few weeks have been a glorious blur due to this man.  <br /> <br />Naturally, WANT ONE was the first set of songs that captivated me. I consider this album to be one of the very few masterpieces I have ever heard. I wish I were dramatizing, but truly I'm not.  <br /> <br />Not only is this the most flattering sequence of songs, track by track there is not a single dry moment. A vast degree of diversity found here: the deliciously classical and opera oriented \\"Vibrate\\", the lounge style \\"Harvester of Hearts\\", the resonating gospel sound of \\"Beautiful Child\\" (and also a personal favorite). Is-this-the-Beach-Boys-I'm-hearing \\"Vicious World\\", the celebratory and outlandish \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\" along with the Bolero-infused \\"Oh What A World\\" are closest to a Broadway showtune you'll get than an actual Broadway showtune. The lulling lullaby of \\"Natasha\\", the jaunty rhythm and soul of \\"14th Street\\", the charming simplicity of \\"Pretty Things\\" and the imagery in one's mind painted by \\"Dinner At Eight\\". Each song has its own signature scent, it's own created mood. Impeccable arrangement and production.   <br /> <br />Aside from the musical orchestrations, Wainwright's lyrics are in a league of their own and must be noted that way. His are the kind substantial enough to read like poetry. He tells a story with suddle satire and humor, while alway maintaining that string of self-conciousness and worldly pain. Heartache, heartbreak, inquizitive wonder, self-destruction, and picking up the pieces. He writes about things I only dream of communicating.  <br /> <br />He's got a way with words, with melody, with delivery, with sentiment. He's got a way. I honestly don't plan on turning Rufus off anytime in the near future. With his brand new album WANT TWO just released, there are more rich and textured pieces of gold for me to delve into.... further pushing my strange and sick love affair with Rufus Wainwright.  <br /> <br />He's NOT bad on the eyes either. But that's just an unnecessary tag at the end of an unnecessary amazon.com review.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I loved the books. I enjoyed the first two movies. This movie has a different feel to it than the first two. Several keybits are missing from the storyline. Things are rearranged compared to the book. Overall it told the story well enough. It was enjoyable. I think that the movie is still better than a lot of stuff released onto the screen. It was worth seeing at the theater despite the high cost. It is worth buying on DVD. Harry Potter both in book and on film will always be one of my favorite series.
B000268QB2|4.0|I spent a few minutes, maybe 2, contemplating on whether to rate Keane's \\"Hopes And Fears\\" a 3 or a 4. I went with 4 because my helpless sensitivity got the best of me.     Weeks ago I previewed a few Keane songs from the album. I believe they included the single, \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", \\"Bedshaped\\", and \\"Your Eyes Open\\". Dismissing them as a sweet n' saccharine Brit-pop band, I didn't keep these previews for long. It may have been my listening to post-punk staples such as Interpol, Sigur Ros, and the like at the time that kept me from enjoying the harmonious crystal clear sound of Keane.    I found the album at a local Borders last week for a slim $9.99 and figured, what the hell. I'm not known to just buy an album spontaneously. I've crashed and burned from that process one too many times. But at such a low price and a shift in the music I was listening to, I jumped for it.     I'm pleasantly surprised. However, it must be said countless times, this is nothing ground-breaking, nothing original, and nothing lingering to my ears. It is enjoyable. They're a band without a guitarist? Sorry, no dice. Tom Chaplin's vocal range is striking. His highs and lows have crystalline energy and are often spine-tingling. Tim Rice's expertise in keyboard and piano is a nice touch and Richard Hughes' drumming is mediocre at best. These guys have a knack for writing melodies that stay with the listener for maybe 15 minutes after the last time it's heard. In retrospect, this is an advantage in terms of the subpar genre they are currenly in. Then again, a disadvantage in the grand scheme of things.     I see Keane as a band with inevitable talent and no staying power. One reviewer took the words out of my mouth by describing this band as using a great hook, but continuously using that hook throughout their whole album, diminishing the great hook that was initially there. It's a sad but true debut act that occurs all the time. I will hold out for their second album in hopes that theywere granted a chance to shake things up a bit. I see potential and I'd hate for it to go to waste.    Preferred songs: \\"Your Eyes Open\\" \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" \\"Sunshine\\" \\"Untitled I\\"
0441003257|4.0|Good Omens is a silly look at the potential end of the world. There are several story lines going on at once. Sometimes it takes thought to keep them straight. It is an enjoyable book. I breezed through the first half of the book. The satanic nun is pretty funny. She sticks out in my head in a way that none of the other characters do. Most likely for the comment about the cute toes upon seeing the antichrist.
B000002LQR|5.0|When I tried to think of one word that sums up the aura of this album, \\"invincible\\" came to mind. Why? Well you'll just have to listen to it for yourself to really know. I will say however, that this album grooves, rocks, meditates, remorses, and moves in a way unlike any other album I can think of. From the freak-out stomp of \\"Give It Away\\" to the epic-balladry of \\"Under The Bridge\\" to the Zeppelin-meets-Beatles-meets-minstrel-waltz of \\"Breaking The Girl\\" this album satisfies the hunger of even the most rabid music junkie. OWN IT.
B000026HWR|5.0|One day about thirty-five years ago.I was browsing in a  record store.Not looking for anything in particular.When  my eyes hit upon this ablum cover.Partly because I guess  the woman was naked (Yeah).Now I must admit I did not know a thing about Terry Callier,and had never heard of  him.But the album caught my attention so I brought it.  Once I got the album home I begin to wonder what the woman was thinking about.She had the most thoughtful look on her face.As she sat in the chair in a almost fetal  position with a cigarette in her hand.Was she thinking  about a current lover or an ex-lover or maybe a love that will never be.As Terry Callier says\\"A heart cannot live if a heart isn't giving\\".And that statement really does  apply to love,and the lady on the cover.What Color Is Love a 1972 effort by Terry Callier is one of the best albums I've ever brought.Terry Callier is not only a great singer but he is also a great songwriter.He wrote  songs in the 70s for the Dells on the old Cadet label.On  What Color Is Love Terry Callier with the help of a few  friends like his long time songwriting partner Larry Wade and arranger,producer Charles Stepney have put together a classic album.The musical journey begins with Dancing Girl-With a great arrangment,the song takes you on a dream trip that ends with a hard look at drugs and prostition.The title track What Color Is Love-Is not a love song,but a song about love.The song tells us that love can be wrong or right,can be as simple as black and  white but it can also be complicated it can be strong,deep,giving,rise to great heights,can be hard to  find and when it's over it can leave you with feelings that may last a lifetime.\\"Yougoin\\"Miss Your Candyman-Is  like a folk and blues song.And maybe the best arrangment  on the album.Just As Long As We're In Love-I love the words to this song and the female background voices sound great.HotsingMee(A Song Of The Sun)-Another good song dealing with war and it's aftermath and the human conition.I'd Rather Be With You-I really love this song.A great love song,and I just love the harmonica playing in  the background.You Don't Care-Is a little instrumental and a little vocal,and a very pleasurable tune.With this  song the musical journey comes to an end.I highly recommend this album.  'nd the human conition.I'd Rather Be With You-I really love this song.A great love song,and I just love the harmonica playing in  the background.You Don't Care-Is a little instrumental and a little vocal,and a very pleasurable tune.With this  song the musical journey comes to an end.I highly recommend this album.

B00006LIRI|3.0|As a hardcore U2 fan, I recognize that the 90's were an incredibly important time for U2.  If it weren't for the extremely bold and uncomprimising music they released in this decade, we wouldn't be here discussing them today. <br /> <br />Having said that, this particular collection falls short of what it could have been.  Nobody questions the quality of U2's output in the 90's (except for those that are too lazy to actually bother listening to 'Pop' and realize that it has some amazing music). With selections like \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"One\\", \\"Beautiful Day\\", amd \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\", you can't really have a terrible collection.  The problem here are the appearance of some songs and the ommission of others.  \\"The Fly\\", \\"Whose Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\", \\"Walk On\\", and \\"Elevation\\" belong here in the place of \\"The First Time\\", \\"The Hands That Built America\\", and \\"Miss Sarejevo\\".  These songs are good, but shouldn't be on a 'best of.'  Also, the re-working of the songs from 'Pop' is completely uneccessary; the versions from the actual album are far superior. <br /> <br />So for those that are curious about getting into U2 (and I know there are quite a few of you, because you constantly here about how legendary this band is and may not know why) you shouldn't be discouraged from listening to their music from this decade just because this collection is somewhat un-even - go out and buy or at least borrow the cd's from this extremely dynamic era of U2's career.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I'm a little surprised at the level of criticism expressed by other Amazon reviewers of this set.  Granted, it's impossible to truly represent Elton John's long and impressive career in 2 CDs.  However, this set does a very fine job of it.  They could have added a 3rd CD, but then it would have been in the category of a box set and less affordable to many casual fans.  I'm impressed by the fact that they packed 34 songs into this set.  The first CD is 79 minutes long.  The second CD is 78 minutes. . . less than 3 minutes of total empty disc space.  And the song selections span his entire career nicely.  It doesn't emphasize one particular portion of his career, and precious space isn't wasted on new material either.  I am very satisfied with this collection.
B000002TQV|5.0|I had The Bends on the shelf for many years.  I saw Radiohead warm up for REM in 1995 and again last year.  Listened to it again and now I listen to The Bends just about every day.  This is one of the best albums ever and begun the evolution of Radiohead that continues today.
B0004Z33F0|3.0|I was trying to figure out why I, and most other folks it seems, don't believe that this episode has enough to hold our interest as the others. It certainly has action and destruction, but something is not quite right overall.... <br />Then it hit me. The kid. That's thing that has always rubbed me wrong about this film. And the more I think about it, the more sense it makes. Any film in which the adult hero gets all buddy-buddy with a child (regardless of the child's \\"importance\\" to the plot) tends to lose peoples' interest. For example: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,  Star Wars: Episode 1, Last Action Hero, and so forth. Children simply do not belong in an adult action world, and the films which involve them in the storyline truly do seem to suffer from public disinterest, not to mention bad filmmaking.  <br />This film also has comparatively more \\"talk\\" than the first two, and is slower to build. The scene in which Rambo is participating in the Afghan horseback game is clearly ridiculous filler material, and some of the characters are just annoying. I can't explain why. They just are. Especially that kid. He bugs me just as much as he bugs Rambo.  <br />We also see Rambo's trainer/mentor Col. Trautman get into the action, not that that is anything exciting. It's odd that the guy who claims to have made Rambo the killing machine that he is has none of the abilities of his student. For a \\"Green Beret\\"--especially one who allegedly has enough skill to warrant being a trainer--his performance in combat is pathetic. Trautman is less a \\"killing machine\\" than a washing machine. <br />There are however some humorous moments which is a new concept to the franchise (\\"It turns blue.\\") and not entirely unwelcome, but I believe less talk about the Afghan plight against the Russians, less children, and the body count of the second film would have helped this one immensely. I think it was trying to be cerebral and that is not good for this genre.
B0001EFTVA|4.0|I catched this on Starz the other day, this was a funny anime. <br /> <br />A baby thats kidnapped gets dumped and is found by a homeless gay couple. One man names the baby Kiyoto after his daughter. <br /> <br />By a strange twist, he meetshis long lost daughter, though the homeless man left his family and from then were heard treated to one bizarre scene after another. <br /> <br />The couple realized the baby is still lost and try to find the real mother, a woman claming to be the mother takes the baby, but the gay couple realize she is a fake and hunt her down. <br /> <br />Dont want to give anymore info except this is one funny anime. <br /> <br />
B00005JNDZ|3.0|I found some of this movie hysterical, yet also very frustrating to watch someone constantly doing self-damaging things.  The first movie seemed more innocent in the wackyness of Bridget.  This one seemed to try too hard and simply lacked the charm and chemistry of the first.  Can't compare to the book as I have not read this one.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I agree that Nemesis was not without some flaws and it carried on a more darker vision of the Next Generation series as did First Contact, but it was a good movie altogther. It certainly had a better plot than the previous Insurrection and even Generations which I felt had a very weak plot after all the publicity spent upon it.  <br /> <br />Did anyone notice how the young Picard from the Next Gen tv episode \\"Tapestry\\" (5th season??) had \\"hair\\" during the fight with the Norsican and as they portray from pictures in Nemesis, Picard was as bald as he is now. Just a little nitpick there for Phil Farrand fans (wink). <br /> <br />The space battles with Shinzon's battleship, the Romulan cruisers and Enterprise-E were beautifully and flawlessly done, especially the \\"ramming\\" sequence.  <br /> <br />I just found it a bit curious how the mainstream Romulans were apparently on Picard's side as was revealed in the ending battle. Isn't the Federation supposed to be on uneasy terms with Romulus?  <br /> <br />I was shocked to see Data come to an end, but at least he went with a heroic cause. Of course the introduction of the B-4 android could easily be programmed to become another Data in time (with a little tweaking around from Geordi).  <br /> <br />Nemesis ends with at least some sign that there may be a 5th Next Generation movie seeing that the Enterprise-E is in spacedock undergoing refit. Let's hope the next movie sheds some light upon the final frontier instead of remorse as did Nemesis..
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I think that I can see the light now. The horrible emo, and fake pop age that seemed to begin in 2000 up to now just might be fading away, finally. I know that I myself was beginning to give up on listening to any new music, for its all either emo bands like Thursday, Taking Back Sunday and other horribly un-talented girl bands speaking of the whiny 13 yr old girl problems.  <br /> <br />Now however, there are some bands shining through, like Modest Mouse, The Shins, and now to add spectacularly- FRANZ FERDINAND. They are a band with totally catchy beats and tunes, while maintaining a unique sound that they can definitely call their own. Almost every single song on the album makes me want to get up and dance. This is music that will make your party complete, the music that will lift you off your feet, the music that will pick you up when you are down. Before you know it, the music will have folded over you as a warm wave of water flowing through your fingers, hair, and body. Songs like \\"Take Me Out\\", \\"Dark of the Matinee\\", \\"Michael\\", \\"This Fire\\", \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" and \\"Forty Feet\\" will make your day.
B000089RVX|1.0|That's about it.  Except their beats/songs are nowhere near what LP does.
0802130208|4.0|John Kennedy Toole's novel delighted me, and I found it interesting and intelligent throughout my read. Ignatius, waddling around New Orleans with his green hunting cap (and sometimes with his gold earring and hot dog stand), is a comic character who elicits sympathy and/or disgust, depending on the abuse he receives or his current mission.  <br /> <br />It seems that the narrator relates to Ignatius but also finds him repulsive. I believe the sarcastic tone also applies to the idea of Ignatius J. Reilly existing as a genius amongst dunces. No doubt that Ignatius is more intelligent than many of his New Orleans contemporaries, but he also keeps himself ignorant to the grief he causes his mother and the disastrous circumstances that follow his weighty shadow. Some may say this is why he is a genius - because he is on an enlightened level where others can never understand his musings. Or rather, he is educated yet misguided in many of his choices. Ignatius finds himself in the wrong time period and longs for the hierarchy of the Dark Ages.  <br /> <br />A Confederacy of Dunces is filled with amusing scenes - Patrolman Mancuso arresting the massive Ignatius, Jones' pretending to sweep the Night of Joy floor (while wearing his sunglasses), Miss Harla O'Horror's bird dance, the Gypsy Queen addressing the Quarter's \\"elegant\\" - just to name a few. The plot keeps you engaged, and you can't help wondering what crazy situation Ignatius will find himself in next. (I wished that Ignatious and Mrs. Levy could have encountered each other. The dialogue exchanged would have been great.) <br /> <br />Toole's work is witty and makes you wonder whether a real-life Ignatius would be treated in the same way. If nothing else, I hope that you find this book humorous and inventive. <br />
B00005JKC3|5.0|I must admitt when i first watch this film in the movies i was left speechless i mean i didn't know what to expect... after having watch xmen and spiderman which i both enjoyed watch Hulk has left a different taste in my mouth... it was kinda bitter really.....  yes my first experience of hulk is a bit disappointing like most fans will say... but then i got it on DVD and gave it a second chance and then it was like being hit by a gamma radiation i was energized and totally transformed into the Hulk!!!!  now i absolutely love this film and i will explain why i do ... <br /> <br />firstly i would like to rate my favrioute comic movies : <br /> <br />1. Xmen 2 and Hulk(yep gets equal first position) <br />2. Xmen 1 <br />3. Spiderman (chessy but fun to watch) <br />5. Hellboy (hmmmm not soo great of a film good character but) <br />100. daredevil (i wish i was blind so i could not watch this crap) <br /> <br />ok let me break hulk down to bits.. <br /> <br />firstly the story is very different to any superheores i have even seem i mean this guy hates himself and his super cool powers, the military hates, his dad hates him when he's not green.. it seems just about everyone hates him guess how HULK will feel!!! secondly he doesn't help or save people most of the film he just try to stay out of people's way and making he's escape from the military guys... <br /> <br />how can i like this film when he's not super cool? well i like hulk becos he seems soo REAL, i remember when watching the movie some of the scenes where he's just looking at you quietly it really give you sense of feeling rather its sad or innocence... hulk is a very well developed character much more so than spiderman or xmen here ann lee has taken a different approach to bring hulk to life by first giving hulk a soul. <br /> <br />from many of my friend they told me how hulk became to be hulk was a sad story when he becomes the hulk he is unable to control his own action and the movie has captured that element very accuarately, i think most people when watching the hulk really expected it to be a spiderman but one shouldn't see it like that... you should see this film as the hulk only. <br /> <br />ILM has done a great job on bring hulk onto the big screen what i can say the speical effect and digital hulk is truely a MASTER PIECE i give all my respect to that... but one must not forget its story though not as action packed as xmen or spiderman but it offers a different view to a superheroe a human side to it a side that most superheroes movies have done little to bring out... ann lee's vision of hulk is a powerful one, most people who watched the hulk will no know that ann lee did the motion capture for the hulk all by himself yes that little man has all the hulk inside him... <br /> <br /> <br />the script is well written nothing too chessy or lame( eg. \\"we would not tell spiderman!\\" from the boy on the train from spiderman 2 just that line has totally ruin it for me how lame) <br /> <br />i recommend anyone who has seen the hulk and hated or did not enjoy it as much the first time around to watch it again cos it is REALLY A GREAT FILM its a shame that people want to see more and more of senseless action and not try to get in touch with the characters... the hulk for me was a film that touched me on a personal level sometime i feel i could change into the hulk but it seems no one can get me angry enough hehehe.. <br /> <br /> <br />fan of the comic this is a must to collect... <br /> <br />you DO NOT want to make the hulk angry.. <br /> <br />
B00004RJ74|5.0|i loved this film. i remember seeing it on a matinee showing and there were two old ladies that sat in the front row from where i was seated. When the vampires scenes flashed on the screen they imediately got up and left. I laughed they must've either thought they were watching a drama movie or they got in the wrong theather. I heard one of them say,\\"wahh!! lets get outa here!!\\" Anyway, Quentin Tarantino is awesome, an i love Juliet Lewis too. You can only wish Hollywood produces more films of this kind that are excellently made and you get your money's worth.

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is one of those films that you'll fall in love with it again and again... Everything about Amelie is perfect!  <br /> <br />Stroy is wonderfully romatic.  <br /> <br />The Characters are beautifully crafted i just love the narration in the film i think these days narration has been almost forgotten but when done superbly its just add and enrich the story all over... <br /> <br />The script and dialogue is tasteful yet funny making all the characters very natural dispite Amelie's and Nino's odd behaviours but that's the spices of the film... <br /> <br />Each scene is beautifully shoot, vibrant in colors and the special effects are soo approriately done that its how special effect should be used in film (unlike lots of recent hollywood films where special effect is done to death and almost everywhere in the film in an attempt wow the audience with flashy digital effects but suffers from a totally unintersting story making the viewing experience unbearable... got a have a good story!!! special effect should not be used as the story but only enchance the visual effect) <br /> <br />Amelie is cleverly written and beautifully presented. Truely one of the best film i have ever seen... watch it, and fall in love with it... <br /> <br />***** 5 STARS ****** <br /> <br />
B00004YTZE|4.0|Good punk album elevated to great due to the new remixes. Personally, I feel this is right up there with \\"Rocket to Russia\\", \\"Blank Generation\\", and \\"Talking Heads '77\\" as a classic American punk album. There is a certain joy to the rock 'n' roll sounds that are captured on this album, and it is certainly the best post-Dolls Thunders release. I had heard a few of the original mixes, and quite frankly they were below par. The guitars and lyrics sound blurry. Thankfully, someone decided to show us all how it was truly a great album despite it's sound imperfections by remixing it. As the story of the band goes, the album failed to make a good amount of money, and they broke up. I guess the song \\"Born to Lose\\" is a little prophetic.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This has been a old movie now and i am just review it now... so here it goes... <br /> <br />I first got a glimpse of the trailer online before the movie was actually released in the movies and i didn't like it all that much it felt really lame something about it wasn't right. Fortunately i knew better to judege on a movie before seeing all of it so i reserved my judegement til i watch it on the BIG screen... <br /> <br />To my surprise I actually enjoyed it very much, it had content, action, teary bits and yes whats a superheroes film without saving people... so as a superhero standard it has it all... <br /> <br />The character development namely spiderman himself is well constructed in a hasty way i mean he got bitten by a spider(super smart) and then went home felt sick and next day he's spiderman and it didn't take long for him to enbrace his new super power so yes it was brief but only just any shorter spiderman creation would have been unsatisfactory...  <br /> <br />What i find the movie didnt' work for me is the dialogue/script its really cheesy at times but again i guess thats how its done in comics... afterall this is a comic made into movie... so its ok but script could be less lame like xmen or hulk... but that didn't do too badly for me... <br /> <br />The story is very involving and i think in any superheroe film there should be theme or punch line in spiderman's case its \\"WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLITY!\\" thats a great line kinda remind me of lord of the ring fellowship of the ring when frodo said i never wish the ring came to me and gandof replied something like its not for you to decide, you should only decide with the time its given to you( sorry i think i butched these wonderful lines i am sorry ) <br /> <br />Special effects is good its good to see they have not only made spiderman fly on its webs but put in lots of energy when he swings from web to web... i guess these days all special effects are done very well impressive indeed...<br /> <br />My favrioute aspect of the film is the perfermances... Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst puts on a good and solid acting thats believable and dramatic... but I will give the crown perfermance to Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin he's acting is superb to me he's the green goblin, in some of his scenes he really made you feel the terror from within... i think he stole the show!!! <br /> <br />overall this film is very entertaining to watch this is a film made for fans and to make lots of money all of its qualities and end suggests a sequeal and spiderman has been very sucessful at the box office making millions so it should but thats all it will do for me a good 2 hour of entertainment... however watching the hulk has giving me a everlasting experience and spiderman only 2...  <br /> <br />A good action superheroe movie typical of its genre... but for me and only for me it could do with more depth and magic... <br /> <br />i give ***** 4/5 ***** enjoy <br /> <br />webs get sticky! <br />
B00000729S|5.0|Primative rock 'n' roll classic. I always thought it was some sort of unintentional concept album, due to the fact that all the songs are completely insane! In addition to the normal garage instruments the guitar, drums, and bass, the Monks had an organ and a banjo also, only adding to the otherworldly yelling of their lead vocalist Gary. While America was ditching it's raw garage rock goodness to go to some boring acid-drenched hippy trippy crap bands (i.e. The Beatles and Jefferson Airplane), these guys were singing about how they hated their girlfreinds and vietnam. The story behind is just as strange as the album, so check it out. This is the greatest album ever.
B00006EXL5|4.0|My chemical romance's debut has the raw sound a debut album should have, unlike poseur bands that come out with a polished sounding debut from a major label.  A few songs on this album aren't all that well written but the emotion is there to make up for it.   <br /> <br />Either way, if you're in need of fresh air, I recommend this album.  These are the tracks I like most:  <br />\\"Honey, this mirror...\\"   <br />\\"Vampires will never hurt you\\"   <br />\\"Our lady of sorrows\\"    <br />\\"Early sunsets over Monroeville\\" <br />\\"Demolition Lovers\\"
B0002XDODU|5.0|Wow. I guess I should have expected this considering Rammstein have provided us with three previous (and increasingly better) studio albums: Herzeleid, Sehnsucht, and Mutter. The latter album really left me speechless, and now the latest. Wow. <br /> <br />This latest disc begins by taken another step up from their last album Mutter. Fans of that album will definitely dig Reise, Reise. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with the title track, Reise, Reise which is a totally rockin' tune a lot like the Mutter tracks. It has the same intro appeal as Mutter's Mein Herz Brennt had. The lyrics are very cool. <br /> <br />The second track and first single, Mein Teil, is another instant hit. Really creepy sounding verses and a kick ass chorus; You can't help but give in to the head bang. <br /> <br />The next three tracks (Dalai Lama, Keine Lust, Los) all have a great sound to them. They seem to be like old Rammstein but with new freshness and more evolved lyrics. <br /> <br />Amerika is a terrific satire on American capitalism. Made to sound like a pride ballod, it's really a leftist anthem of sorts. Delightfully bitter lines like \\"This is not a love song, I don't sing my mother tongue,\\" are a tribute to how political this band is. <br /> <br />Moskau is the shining zenith of this album. In all its glory this is my favourite Rammstein song. The music is rife with emotion and the two languages (German and Russian; Russian verses performed wonderfully by Viktoria Fersh) are used together beautifully. If you thought Links 2-3-4 was leftist, listen to this! Another really cool touch: Moskau was blended in to the song Amerika which preceeds it. <br /> <br />And the final four songs (Morgenstern, Stein Um Stein, Ohne Dich, Amour) bring the album to a powerful finale. The first two of these are strong rock songs reminiscent of Sehnsucht and Mutter (and a few from Herzeleid) while the final two are slower paced like the ballods from the first three albums (Herzeleid's Seemann, Sehnsucht's Klavier, and Mutter's Nebel). <br /> <br />I call this a modern day masterpiece because it proves that the band who made this album is clearly climbing upward into the realm of perfection. I know this will sound stupid, but I liken Rammstein to a band I'm sure a lot of people (unfortunately) have forgotten about: The Buggles (for all the musical laymans, they were the two guys who did 'Video Killed the Radio Star'). They combine rock sensibilities with strange almost techno-like sounds in order to bring politcal and other themes to life using a totally new and uncopiable sound (Albeit heavier and quite a bit darker). This is all the more present on Reise, Reise. <br /> <br />Overall, old Rammstein fans will love Reise, Reise for it's throwbacks to the original 1995 stuff, and newer fans will be amazed at just how well the band topped their last effort.
B00025ETIW|5.0|After hearing MCR's debut, I couldn't wait for this one to come out.  When it finally did, I fell in love with it and it's been in my player ever since.  This album is way different than their first.  Better production - Gerard's singing and the band's songwriting have improved vastly. <br /> <br />Some say MCR sold out because they signed onto a major label, but I say those fans are just bitter.  You didn't think you could keep MCR in your backpocket forever, did you? <br />   <br />Anyway, this album will kick you in the ass from start to finish and leave you wanting more.  Ignore negative comments about this album.  I would list the best tracks, but they're all great.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you've been waiting for a DT album that makes you want to put your head thru the drywall, your wait is over.  TOT is unarguably DT's most continuously heavy album to date.  If your prog tastes trend toward the less-heavy elements of DT, I'd strongly advise avoiding this cd. <br /> <br />Although I think that this is an awesome album, I would neither expect nor desire for the band to take this approach next time around.   <br /> <br />If all of this sounds a bit confusing, here's the bottom line:  Although it doesn't really break any new ground musically, this album is sinfully delicious to listen to - a great mixture of the rhythmic complexity that we're used to combined with ample servings of simple but brutally effective riffs that will satisfy any headbanger's appetite.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|I'm always excited when an artist releases their first greatest hits! I don't know what it is... maybe it's the songs that are chosen? Maybe it's looking back on a span of a career?  I figured that since it has been a decade (that's usually when a greatest hits is released) that it was about time Shania released hers...<br /><br />This is not exactly a pretty set list for a few reasons.  I don't know why they'd open up with \\"Forever and For Always\\" It's a great song, but I would've thought she'd gone for the newest single (Party for Two) or a upbeat opening which is always a good choice.<br /><br />There are only 3 songs from UP!  \\"I'm Gonna Get You Good\\", \\"Up\\" and \\"Forever And For Always\\" but what about \\"When You Kiss Me\\" or \\"Ka-Ching\\" or \\"It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing\\" there are some magnificent songs on this album that's been excluded due to the likes of mediocre songs like \\"Honey I'm Home\\" \\"No One Needs To Know\\" and \\"Come On Over\\"<br /><br />I do like some of the harder to find mixes like \\"From This Moment On\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Get You Good\\" but \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" sticks out like a sore thumb! The original is far superior.<br /><br />Then there is the omission of songs from her first album.  Granted, she didn't write any of the singles & it was a flop, but there were songs that people enjoyed that Shania still performs i.e. \\"What Made You Say That?\\" comes to mind... after all, this is a retrospective!<br /><br />\\"Party For Two\\" should have only one version.  Just like Sheryl Crow's \\"First Cut is The Deepest\\" it only needs to be on the record once.  IMO I like the version with Billy rather than Mark (even though I do like Sugar Ray)<br /><br />HIGHLIGHT SONGS: I'm Gonna Get You Good, From This Moment On, Man I Feel Like A Woman, Love Gets Me Everytime, You're Still The One, The Woman In Me, If You're Not In It For Love<br /><br />Bottom line: I just think overall it could've been a better CD, but it seems a little thrown together!  I can't wait until we get another studio album from Ms. Twain!!wait until we get another studio album from Ms. Twain!!

B0002MB7QW|2.0|Ok, it's not easy to satisfy critics. Emmerich has been (rightfully) backlashed for soulless stupidities like GODZILLA, THE PATRIOT, etc.... So, when he does a movie about a serious subject, where the action is a lot more slow paced, he fails again... <br /> <br />Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is the worst of them all, it will take some months (or years) to producers around the world give him another chance in something so \\"big-budgeted\\".
B000669GAI|5.0|yeh it doesnt have present tense but chaeck out the playlist before you buy no disappointments i cant wait til they release another cd
0553801503|5.0|The Song of Fire and Ice books are wonderful and like other readers I have re-read them while waiting for A Feast for Crows to be released.  What to do? <br /> <br />Get the unabridged audio books ([...] is a good source) put on the headphones, and listen to Roy Dotrice.  You can even read along in your printed version while you listen to this terrific narration.  You won't find but a few mistakes and the voices Mr. Dotrice develops for each character are great. <br /> <br />This should hold you over since it takes over 125 hours to listen to the first three books.
B00007CVSH|3.0|As a long time Verdi fan, I looked forward to this DVD with great hopes. I was looking for a version that did not have either Pavarotti or Domingo in the title role and that utilized digital technology to provide good home viewed opera. Obviously, from the title line, my hopes were not realized.    First of all, this is a cut version of Verdi's work; it is incomplete. After all these years of including every note that the maestro composed, I had hoped that the older, truncated versions of the score had been trashed.  Disappointment number one!    Second, Jose Cura in the title role of Manrico has trouble with vocal technique. He forces a \\"covered\\" or head tone far too low in the middle register, as low as e-flat in some instances. The tone produced is plain ugly. He can act, though.    Third, soprano Veronica Villarroel is just not a \\"Verdi soprano\\". Oh, she sings with some excellent sensitivity, once she gets warmed up, but she is no Leontyne Price by a long shot. Ms. Villarroel would do well enough in bel canto, but lacks the vocal depth to do justice to Verdi.    Fourth, the staging is horrible! The convent scene looks like an electrical power station; the firearms carried by Manrico's men include flintlock rifles and bolt action ones. The second scene contains the famous \\"Anvil Chorus\\", but there are no  anvils, and no fire where there is supposed to be one during Azucena's aria, \\"Stride la vampa\\".    The plusses are there, but not enough to outweigh the negatives.  Hvorostovsky is the best Count di Luna I have ever seen, and is vocally second only to the incomparable Leonard Warren. The conductor, chorus and orchestra all do very well, and the Digital technology is excellent throughout.    However, my advice is to save your money and wait for another version. At the rate that operas are being issued these days, it should not be long before someone like TDK gives us a Trovatore to rave about. Until then, enjoy some of the othere great operas that are available here.
B000003CKH|5.0|Not only is the music great, but its so diverse, which is why I love this album so much. From rock to altenative and even a little country, this album has it all. And The last song is a waltz, not tried by many artists but cake pulls it off. I would have to say my favorite song is italian leather sofa(i love the guitar melody and the trumpet solo).

B00005JMUL|5.0|I took my 7 year old son to see this movie today, and there was a point in the movie where I had \\"that feeling.\\"  This is a feeling I don't often get watching a movie.  It is hard to describe it, but I know that the next time, and every other time I see that spot in the film, this thrill will return.  The last time I got that thrill was when I saw \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and I got to the scene at the Bridge at Khazad Dum.  This feeling can only be evoked in me when image, music, story converge into memorable wonder.<br /><br />For me, this was a true Christmas movie.  The spirit of the film was beyond the commercialism that holiday fare has, of late, become, which is ironic since it uses technology at the cutting edge.  Reviews I have read seem to call it a failure because of its creepiness of characters, vagueness, sublime underscore of terror.  I believe it was a success because of these things.  I remember reading an article by Maurice Sendak, author of the \\"Wild Things\\" books, where he criticized modern children's book writers for forgetting the terror that is part of childhood, the terror that folk stories still remember, but our modern, psychologist-approved TV and books deny or try to sugar over.<br /><br />In this movie, the children are at the edge of danger constantly; critics rebuke the movie for this.  Indeed they are; as young children are.  These are beings who have not yet found that there can be a stability in life because there hasn't been enough of it for them to trust a stability.  They don't have enough experience to understand that you can depend on the tracks to be there.  It is a rollercoaster ride; a tightrope walk.  The lead character is taken back to that uncertain childhood; the skeptic who has begun questioning his beliefs is taken back to this wild terror, and through it finds belief.  Zemekis is smart in that he acknowledges that it is a dream, but he doesn't make a big deal about the line between dream and reality.  Is there really that big a wall between the two?  For a child, a believer, there is not.<br /><br />One of the many amazing scenes in here is when the three leads walk along the rail line, above a bottomless plunge.  And Zemekis is smart enough to make this scene silent: no scary music, no pumped up fear shots.  The kids simply walk the rail, arms out for balance, knowing there is no safety net, yet they do it.  That is childhood too.  They deeply fear the terror of death, but they don't fully understand it either, as we adults do.<br /><br />And yes, the kids have no names.  They are not meant to.  There is a deep allegorical element to this story.  The boy of the mid-20th century who has become a skeptic to magic in life?  The industrial/almost-facist nature of the North Pole factory?  The elf within the camp-like factory who subtly throws in a Yiddish word?  The black female child whose ticket is lost by the white boy and is sent out of the passenger car, whose challenge it is to lead?  I am sure you can find more allegorical examples of the roots of the later 20th century and our loss of wonder and belief.<br /><br />If you go to this movie merely to measure the accuracy of the special effects, you may nitpick details like the lifeless eyes, the miffed body movements, etc., but you will be missing the point of this movie.  For children, the wolves are always howling just outside the window, following the careening train through the ride to adulthood.  Most adults successfully negotiate this ride, and abandon those fears as silly childhood nonsense.  Some of us realize the magic is tied in with that terror, and realize belief is both a spiritual wonder and a breathless terror.etween the two?  For a child, a believer, there is not.

6305014140|2.0|Okay animation + convoluted plot + extended graphic anime violence + brief anime nudity = a movie any 14-year-old boy should love.  Unfortunately, not many of us are fourteen years old anymore.<br /><br />  If this is indeed a \\"peak achievement of Japanese anime\\" you can keep it.  For those of us spoiled by classic western animation this could be a big disappointment - only the lips moves when a character speaks, static images are panned and scanned by the animators (or brought forward rapidly if the character is supposed to be running towards the camera), cels sequences are repeated over and over (a scene of a river filled with dead fish uses this trick - the same fish, in the same relation to the others, are repeated rather than freshly drawn.)  On the other hand, there's a nice use of color in NINJA SCROLL and some of the fight scenes are very well rendered.<br /><br /> Still, being mildly impressed with a scene or two doesn't make a movie recommendable.
B000669GAI|5.0|\\"Even Flow\\" is the re-recorded \\"video version\\" from back in '92.  It's not a new version.  Thanks.
B000002B2T|5.0|If you enjoyed Alice in Chains' Jar of Flies release, you'll adore this album. No, there is no catchy sound of Pearl Jam's early days. There is no scent of metal influence from Alice in Chains, because the metal-head Jerry Cantrell is absent here. You get something similar though, in that it is dark, depressing, and downright beautiful. This just might be the grungiest album (if there is such thing) of the grunge era. Layne Staley's lyrics on this album truly shine, as well as his vocals. McCready's guitar, well, awesome as usual. Martin's drumming is outstanding, and if you are lucky enough to see the video of Mad Season Live at The Moore, you'll see how truly amazing it is on X-Ray Mind -- just incredible. He moves so fast it looks as though he has 3 or 4 arms sometimes. Then of course the terrific bass playing by the late Baker. The death of Baker was why the band stopped creating music together -- it just was not the same without him, and it is only right to move on. Still, what the band managed to produce was this one standout album that speaks volumes of the members' talents and abilities to shine in another band. And boy do they ever. As mellow as most of the tracks may be, they are equally as beautiful on an intellectual level. Whether you're a fan of classic rock, country, or heavy metal, this CD is a must have for a fan of great music period!
B0006284JQ|5.0|I like this cd! It actually puts in all her #1 hit songs in here and I can stop poping from one cd to another to listen to the good tracks. Her other tracks are good but I like the hit songs.  If you  are the person who hardly listens to Britney, this is good cd to start.  All her #1 songs are put in one disc and you don't have to buy all the others to listen to it . Just One!
B00006CXSS|5.0|What CAN'T be said about Band Of Brothers? From the actual soldiers portrayed in the series giving commentary before each act, to what is the best cinematography I've ever seen on film, this is a PERFECT tribute to those brave men who fought and Won World War II.  <br />The actors actually seem to age from episode 1, through 10 hours to episode 10. Each 1 is perfectly cast in their respective roles. With each episode, comes a different director (with Tom Hanks directing 1 as well), but the series is seemless in it's story telling. <br />If you haven't seen this GREAT achievement yet, please do yourself (and the Soldiers this story portrays) a service, and watch it form beginning to end, in a sitting. <br />
B00068IOWM|5.0|Best U2 ever, I am a fan since 1985 and they never stop to amaze me, in this new record you can find a new and fresh U2, Bono Vocals are as strong as in the Joshua tree but maturer, I do not understand how he can hit those notes at his age, it feels like he is crying in \\"Sometimes you cant make it on your own\\" the lyrics also feel like they are flowing from his heart and they certainly reach yours, but this album has much more in it, It is very hard to tell wich are the best songs because they are all great, it is like a trip through your feelings, spine chilling, chicken skin maker, Larry exploding, Adam filling with waves of bass and Edge making his best sounding guitar since achtungbaby. <br />This album is a must, give you the chance to have one of the best albums ever! And if you think my review is not neutral remember my coments when you see it in the Rollings stone 100 best albums ever!
0689835604|4.0|My daughter is 21months and loves this book.  We have had it for several months and she is still not tired of it.  She loves to play peek-a-boo with the babies in the book.  The only drawback is the flaps are definately not child proof.  Our copy is now well taped to repair torn pages.  I would throw it away if she didn't love it so much.
B000003BF1|5.0|I'm a huge Rolling Stones fan. They are my favorite band and the greatest rock and roll band in the world. Sorry to all the Beatles fans, i love them too but they just lack some of the incredible sophistication and talent the Stones have. The cover art is also very interesting. The album explodes with the first track \\"Gimme Shelter\\" with Keith Richards giving us one of his best guitar riffs he has done. The songs dark lyrics and great beat make this one of their best. Track 2 is their cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain\\". This is by far the best version ever done of this song and it features Ry Cooder on the mandolin. Track 3 is their country version of Honky Tonk Woman which adds a good variety to the album. Track 4, \\"Live With Me\\" has a great bass line and to show how multi-talented they all are Keith Richards is the one playing bass and not the usual Bill Wymann. \\"Let It Bleed\\" has a countryish feel to it with Mick providing soothing vocals. The 2nd best song on the album is \\"Midnight Rambler\\" the song is dark, creepy and mysterious. It has Mick providing a great harmonica part and the lyrics about a villian who strikes in the night will spook you out. On \\"You Got the Silver\\" Keith takes the spot for vocals and they belt out another classic. \\"Monkey Man\\" is an amazing song with a weird but great vibe to it. Keith and Mick both do the vocals on this one. And finally what a way to finsih an album \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\". This song is one of Mick's greatest vocal pieces. It has the London Bach Choir providing some of the vocal parts in the beginning and towards the end. Al Kooper also stars (Super Session, Blood Sweat and Tears) he plays the French Horn, Piano and Organ and their producer Jimmy Miller on the drums. \\"Let It Bleed\\" is another great example of the stones virtuostic talent and their great swagger and ability to play all sorts of styles of music.

0316779237|4.0|Having encountered the praises of Sedaris by other reviewers online I decided to pick up Holidays on Ice as my introduction to his art.  It's a short, fast, and hilarious read on a topic that brings much joy, sorrow, laughter, and terror to us all:  Christmas. <br /> <br />Flipping through the book before purchasing it I see a chapter titled \\"Dinah the Christmas Whore\\" and I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride.  \\"The Santa Land Diaries\\" should be made into a movie.  Or at least should be something read to your family instead of that tired old \\"Twas the night before...\\" rot. Blisters the Elf had me in stitches during this story.  And the fictitious family letter \\"Season's Greetings\\" was a laugh riot. <br /> <br />I will definitely be reading more of Sedaris in the future.
B00069YDXU|4.0|This group never ceases to amaze. This is one of the last shows the band performed prior to Greg Lake's departure. The video quality is crystal clear. The sound is great. Although the band is somewhat slowed from their heyday, their superior musical talent shows throughout this video. Longtime ELP fans will be pleased as this represents one of the last looks at this great band together. The uninitiated should be impressed at the virtuosity of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer. An excellent concert !  <br /> <br />
1591840562|3.0|This book had some great info for people who think big, and are hoping to start the next Amazon.com or Starbucks. I enjoyed the tips and information, but sadly the book aimed a little too high for me and my humble business. There was a lot of info for people in a traditional business world (like about investers, boards, and such), but as a landscaper, I found that most of the information was not broadly useful enough to use in my small business.<br /><br />A few things that I liked:<br /><br />Naming your business a name that can be turned into a verb. In landscaping, that could mean EarthScapes, as in \\"let's EarthScape it!\\"<br /><br />Suggestions about how to make your work and mission easy for people not in the field to understand.<br /><br />The step by step guide to hiring employees.<br /><br />While this manual wasn't quite what I was looking for, I did find some solidly helpful information which made it worth reading. That said, this is really suited to someone in a more traditional business field, and not so much the service oriented field I am in.

I FOUND NICHOLAS CAGE TALKING ON THE PHONE WITHOUT A FACE VERY EERIE!!!!  NICHOLAS CAGE AND JOHN TRAVOLTA HAD DID A GREAT JOB!!!!!!
B000002JOH|5.0|I got this the year it came out, and is still one of my favorites today.  Cowboys through Trendkill are all essential and amazing, but I believe \\"Vulgar\\" to be the best overall.  Cowboys has the best guitar work, FBD is the angriest, Trendkill is the heaviest, and Vulgar has the best songs.  Pantera made me forget about all other metal bands of that time.  GO BUY IT NOW.
B000093BDX|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ROCK AND ROLL GROUPS EVER. THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS GROUP. THIS IS A VERY NICE COMPILATION OF THE BEACH BOYS. HELP ME RHONDA, FUN FUN FUN, BARBARA ANN, SURFIN IN THIS USA, GOOD VIBRATIONS, AND MANY GREAT OTHERS THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ROCK AND ROLL AND BEACH BOY FAN!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I don't know that I really agree with the \\"expert\\" critic's review of this album. He seems to think that Josh's work needs improvement.....WHATEVER! I think Josh has amazing talent, and a fantastic range and variety to his songs. It really doesn't matter that I haven't a clue what he's saying in most of the songs, the tone of his voice and the instrumentals do enough. The songs are so powerful and filled with emotion that they have brought me to tears on more than one occaision. This album is definitely one of the top 10 in my collection. I actually plan on using some of the songs in my wedding next year. This album is certainly worth the money!
0345475674|5.0|I found Harris' treatment of Imperial Rome to be most fair and interesting. Unfortunately, the main character was not very interesting - he really just served as the tool to allow the readers to view Roman society and engineering. It is also unclear as to why he develops his love interest and is so willing to risk his life for her when they've barely spoken to one another.<br /><br />Other reviewers have criticized Harris' treatment of Roman society in general, claiming that he sensationalizes the unseemly parts of Roman life, such as the brothels, the sex with children and the frequent representations of male genitalia in public places and in jewelry. I feel that he represented the spectacle that was Rome quite fairly. The Romans were master engineers, they had a society that allowed quite a bit of upward mobility, women had no rights to speak of, they were brave, and they were sexually explicit. Harris covers these aspects well. The reader would do well to remember that this is not a history of the Romans, it is merely a snapshot of the last 2 days of Pompeii.<br /><br />I think that Harris' depiction of the eruption was some of the best descriptive reading that I've had the pleasure to read for a while: the refugees, Pliny's vainly rushing out of port to try to save the library and refugees, the ash falling, the panic. Well done - it more than makes up for the weak character development in my mind and makes it five stars.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ok, wow! This has to be the absolute best album out this 2004 year.  The fact that I had this album since Febraury, and still bump it like crazy should you how much I love this album.  I mean seriously, I was not anticipating much to be good on this album but his beats.  I mean heard him flow on that one track off the Blueprint 2 album, and it wasnt great at all.  He is an amazing producer.  So thats why I gave the album a chance.  Boy, was I ever happy that I did.  Even though the pink with the bear on it, still throws me off till this day. <br />2. We Don't Dare-(5/5) Catchy chorus, great beat, and very insightful lyrics, this song kicked off the album very well.  Very humurous as well, something I didnt expect Kanye to display so much in this album, which is a good thing.  It adds to it. <br />4. All Falls Down (5/5) Too bad they played it out like crazy, Kanye's 3rd single is still a great song.  He displays great lyricism in this once, and whoever sang that chorus did a great job.   <br />5. I'll Fly Away (4/5) Random, but it goes along with the album, so who cares, its not bad. <br />6. Spaceship (4/5) Very great song, in which he describes his struggles in the industry and how there are time where he wants to just escape. <br />7. Jesus Walks (4.5/5) FINALLY!!!! Someone who can show pride in what they believe in without having to shove it down anyones throat.  I mean I'm an agnostic and I really like the song despite being contradictional to my beliefs.  I mean seriously, why cant more people display their ideas in this fashion without having to annoy or pester others.  Very well done, Kanye. <br />8. Never Let Me Down (10/5) Hands down best song on this album.  Jay-Z and Kanye kills this song so well.  It almost reminds me of when Jay-Z did that one track with Biggie on the Unreasonable Doubt in the aspect of great lyricism.  Their flows are excellent, the beat is great, and even having the preacher man in the middle added to the effect, and having Jay finish it off so nicely, just makes this song one of my favorites of all time. <br />9. Get Em High (4.5/5) From the start Kanye kills this song with his flow.  Kanye is really starting to prove himself to me that he has what it takes to be a juggernaut MC in this game.  Talib's flow is good, but I still expected better.  And Common, well what can I say about Common, he has the great potential of being a great MC if he just should some consistancy.  This tracks shows this very well, where he has great lyrics, but Kanye has to change up the beat just so that Common can sound ok flow-wise.  I was really disappointed with him. <br />11. The New Workout Plan (5/5)  I really expected this song to be a single around the time Jesus Walks was a single.  It would have just made sense to me.  Summer time, inspiration to get women to look better for it.  But hey, its a great song regardless.  Very funny too, and I love how he switches up the beat at the end.   <br />12. Slow Jamz (4.5/5) 2nd Single??? Well I guess you could say that its Twistas single, but to be honest I actually prefer this albums version better.  Its extended, with Jamie Foxx singing more that in the Twista Version.  Still hot in my opinion.  Two of Chi-Towns finest. <br />13. Breathe in Breathe Out (4/5) Probably the worst song on this album and I gave it a 4!!!!  This goes to show you how great I think this album is.  The beat is ok, but kanye doesnt fail to deliver lyrically.  Luda's chorus is is great to me.  Very funny.  Did kinda wish though Luda wouldve spit something on it other than the chorus though.  <br />15. School Spirit (4.5/5) Great song.  I mean I'm in college right now, and know exactly what Kanye is talking.  The only difference he has music talent and I dont, so I'm stuck here.  Seriously, I bet a lot of college student will relate to this song.   <br />17. Two Words (5/5) Creative, very creative.  Great lyrics and flow from all three artists.  Cant go wrong with Mos Def being on any track.  And Freeway despite me not being his biggest fan came off very well.  The beat is very very very good.  Its probably one of my favorites on this album. <br />18. Through the Wire (7/5) Hey if I gave a 10 out of 5, why not a 7?  Kanye's first single is a great one.  Excellent sampling off the Chaka Kahn track.  And it just amazes me that Kanye, with the pain of having to have had his jaw wired shut, due to the horrific accident he was in, that he can still spit better than 90% of rappers out there.  Seriously, lyricals were great, flow was perfect, and add to the amazing beat, he could not and did not go wrong at all. <br />19. Family Business (5/5) I really enjoyed this track, because growing up in a family as big and as close as mind, I could really relate to what Kanye was saying in the song.  Reminds me of the good times I had with my cousins, then I realize that side of the family are a******* and I return back to reality. <br />20. Last Call (6/5) Beat is sick!!!! Punchlines are sick!!!! Flow is nice, seriously, what a way to finish up and album.  Even though this track is 75% talking through a 20 minute track, I can actually listen to the whole thing, because he tells a very good story on how he came to where he is at the time he made the album. <br />Seriously if you have not bought this album, then I can not take your opinion on hip hop to seriously.  This album is in the ranks of debut albums such as Illmatic, Ready to Die, Slim Shady LP and Unreasonable Doubt.  I honestly believe that Kanye has all the tools to be the next Jay-Z as the best Hip Hop artist ever!  (Seriously if you do not consider a man with 10 albums under his belt since 1996 with the consistancy that Jay-Z has, the best or at least a top 5, something is really wrong with you.)  I just really hope he doesnt let the success go to his head.  I'm out for now. Peace
0375404414|5.0|My previous experience with Ken Follett was \\"The Third Twin\\", I book I was not too pleased with. So, when I pulled out this book on tape and saw, to my dismay, that it was by the same author I was expecting garbage.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. This is a fast-paced thriller with loads of office politics and just a touch of romance to keep the pot stirring. There were laugh out load moments, such as when Agent Maddox busts through her potential boyfriend's door.<br /><br />Was the plot feasible? Doubtful. But, it was still interesting and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />The tape was very well-performed by Anthony Heald (perhaps best known as the Assistant Principal on Boston Public). five stars for him.
B000669GAI|4.0|I've been a fan since even before they became \\"Pearl Jam\\" and have followed them religiously through their first four albums. I lost touch but this compilation is great in reminding me of my old favorites and introducing me to their recent work. I love how it's broken down into two discs. \\"Upside\\" features their fast hard paced works and \\"Downside\\" features their more methodical ballad type songs. It's a great collection. The thing I wasn't too fond of was the remixes. The remixes seem to lose something that the originals captured beautifully. Regardless, this CD is still a must have.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|In the first moments of Richard Curtis' wonderfull film comedy, \\"Love Actually\\", we see the words \\"Love actually is all around\\" appear prominently on the screen. And for the next two hours and fifteen minutes, that is exactly the theme, that Mr.Curtis, the Master of British romantic comedies (\\"Notting Hill\\", \\"Bridget Jone's Diary\\", \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\"), goes back to, over and over again. During the course of the movie, we follow the concurrent stories of more than a half dozen different couples as they deal with romance, during the Christmas season in London. They include a young women, who is in love with her office coworker, a widower and his stepson, who is suffering from 'puppy love', an older married couple, who are on the edge of infidelity, a pair of newlyweds & a best friend, a writer and his Portugese house keeper, a young guy lusting after American girls, a couple working as stand-ins for an 'Adult Film' production, and the young British Prime Minister, who has fallen in love with his office's 'Tea Girl'. All these interactively connected stories are framed by a foul mouthed, 'over the hill', rock star and his overweight manager, who are hilariously attempting to get a crass, holiday single to #1 in the charts by Christmas Eve. Sounds like a lot? Well, yes it is. Writer/Director, Richard Curtis has stuffed a lot of plot into this film, attempting only somewhat successfully in making sure each story has a tidy ending at Heathrow Airport. Many of the plotlines are pretty corny with some implausible situations (Yeah, right...the Prime Minister of Britain is knocking on doors in the middle of the night looking for a girl!) But you know what? We don't care! The characters are so likable and they so sweep us away with the romance of the situations, that we suspend our disbelief and sit back and enjoy the movie. Curtis shows us how love can be both joyous and painful. It is a messy emotion, that needs a lot of hard work. But in the end it all seems to be worth the trouble. Love really is all around! The excellent large cast of the movie features some of the 'cream of the crop' of the British film industry. They include actors such as Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightly, Rowan Atkinson ETC. These folks plus many more are all pretty much outstanding in their performances. My personal favorite was actor, Bill Nighy's portrayle of the decrepit rock star, who's wickedly funny comments leave everyone's jaws on the floor during his publicity tour (\\"Hey kids! Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star and you'll get them for free!\\"). Finally, mention should be made of the movie's beautiful photography from Cinematographer, Michael Coulter. The film is a love letter to London in much the same way Manhattan appears in Woody Allen's movies. It is a glossy romantic look, that adds to the romance of the characters and their situations. The DVD of this film is quite well done. The picture and sound are crystal clear. The DVD is chock full of extras including over a half hours worth of deleated scenes (with introductions), that are quite interesting. Furthmore there is an excellent commentary track between Richard Curtis and some of the film's actors, which has verbal sparring, that is just as funny as anything in the movie! Its' pretty obvious, that Curtis and Actor, Hugh Grant are old friends. The good natured, but mockingly sarcastic comments, that the two made, when ever Actor, Colin Firth appeared on screen, had me laughing my head off! Definitely make sure to play that commentary track!! For an evening of wonderful romantic comedy, I highly recomend the film, \\"Love Actually\\".e worth the trouble. Love really is all around!

0596007124|5.0|I am quite impressed with this book's explanations of design patterns.  The authors start each chapter explaining a problem and then showing how a given implementation or two isn't flexible.  Then the text presents a design pattern and shows how to use it and how it solves certain issues.  Along the way, the reader is given general design ideas to keep in mind while architecting or refactoring a system. <br /> <br />Because key concepts are repeated throughout the book using different phrasing and examples, I found learning/reviewing each pattern to be straightforward and easy.  I haven't used Java since '98, but with C# skills I found the code examples fairly simple to understand. <br /> <br />Also note that this book doesn't explain in detail all the patterns explicated in the Gamma et al. text.  Instead, you will learn the Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Factory, Singleton, Command, Adaptor, Facade, Template Method, Iterator, Composite, State, and Proxy patterns will full explanations and code examples.  Other patterns (e.g., Bridge, Builder, Chain of Responsibility, etc.) receive only a brief overview in the back of the book.  The authors feel that those patterns aren't used as often and consequently necessitate less coverage. <br /> <br />If you're looking for no-nonsense writing that delivers design pattern facts in a most direct manner, then choose the original Gang of Four Design Patterns book instead.  But for a much friendlier introduction and explanation of patterns, pick up Head First Design Patterns right away and use Design Patterns by Gamma et al. as a reference.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />
0393317552|1.0|1. The unrivalled extent of the Eurasian landmass allowed the proliferation of many different civilisations, between which information could be exchanged allowing far greater cross-fertilization of cultures. <br />Wrong! However unified the Eurasian land-mass may look to a cartographer, it is intractably divided by formidable topographical features. Europe is isolated from Central Asia by the Alps, the Urals, the Caucasus, the Russian Steppes, the Taiga and the Anatolian plateau. East Asia is divided from Central Asia by the Thar desert the Himalayas the Gobi desert and the Tian Shan mountains. No significant cultural exchanges took place between these regions until the 15th century, by which time sub-Saharan Africa and America lagged far behind Europe and China in terms of technology and higher cultural attainment. Sub-Saharan Africa lies as close to the Fertile Crescent, regarded as the cradle of civilisation, as Western Europe and far closer than China. <br /> <br />2. A diverse abundance of potential food crops is necessary in order for settled agricultural communities to flourish. <br />Wrong! The Inca created a complex civilisation based on the cultivation of two food crops, the potato and maize. Large agricultural communities, like Cahokia in North America, flourished on the exploitation of maize. Western European agriculture was overwhelmingly based on wheat production, China's on rice.   <br /> <br />3.The European biome contained a greater variety of domesticable crops than Africa and America and these crops were more nutritious. <br />Wrong! America had indigenous food crops which were more nutritious than European staples. Beans, corn, squashes and peanuts are superior to wheat and, if grown in rotation, create a self-replenishing agricultural cycle. Far from having no viable indigenous staples, Africa had okra, rice, sorghum, millet, the bambara ground nut, black-eyed peas, watermelons and numerous gourds and tubers, as well as immensely useful plants such as the oil palm and the tamarisk. African slaves actually introduced rice cultivation to the United States. The standard refrence on this subject is, \\"Lost Crops of Africa\\".  <br /> <br />4. Eurasia had more domesticable large mammals than Sub-Saharan Africa or the Americas. <br />Wrong! Africa has indigenous breeds of sheep, goats and cattle which were spread from the Sudan to the Cape by 200AD. The South Americans domesticated the llama. The North Americans, like the Aboriginals of Australia, almost hunted their domesticable mammals to extinction. Why didn't Europeans hunt horses, cows and sheep to extinction?  <br /> <br />5. Only urban civilisations can develop the levels of technological skill and social organisztion required for military conquest. <br />Wrong! The two greatest conquerors in history, Atilla the Hun and Ghengis Khan came from nomadic tribal civilisations. Rome was overthrown by nomads. The Indus valley civilisation was destroyed by Indo-European barbarians. <br /> <br />6. The transmission of European diseases helped European nations conquer non-European nations. <br />Wrong! The European nations had achieved such technological superiority to non-European nations by the colonial epoch, that there could be no serious question of a non-European army successfully resisting an attack by a European army. Europeans conquered huge swathes of territory with tiny armies (Pizzaro). Epidemic disease only became a factor post-conquest. In Africa, India and South America native diseases like malaria were just as deadly to Europeans as European diseases were to the indigenous peoples. <br /> <br />7. China lacked the type of convoluted coastline necessary for dissidents to hide out in. <br />Bizzare! Is Jared Diamond trying to claim that dissidents can only hide on convoluted coastlines? This is about as strange as his assumption that only large bodies of water constitute an effective barrier to trade and travel. China abounds in intractable wastes and remote mountain ranges where bandits and outlaws fled the authority of central government, the most obvious region being the famous water margin. <br /> <br />8. Urban populations are less intelligent than non-urban populations. <br />Western European civilisation sets a premium on education. Abstract reasoning skills are rewarded by better employment prospects, which in turn create enhanced relationship opportunities, meaning that intelligent people are encouraged to procreate with other intelligent people, unlike in Papua New Guinea, where the physical prowess is far more important than deductive logic. <br /> <br />Europe and China developed the worlds greatest civilisations in regions which were no bigger than the regions inhabited by any other cultures, which enjoyed no great advantages in terms of agricultural potential, which had no special abundance of handy food crops and which had particular disadvantages in terms of climate. Diamond's theory sounds so incontestable because he has edited out substantial volumes of contradictory information with the skill and shamelessness of a Stalin era Commissar. <br />
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I would equate watching Napoleon Dynamite to watching a train wreck. It is like something bad that you can't turn away from. Now don't think I did not like the movie, I did, but I do not see why so many people put 5 stars for the film. It reminded me of an early style Wes Anderson style of film (which I do love) but missed the mark by just a bit. The slow build up to nothing might throw a few people off, but the film is well worth watching to the end at least once. I have not plans to purchase this title, but I would watch it again if a friend had it.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This animated film by Disney is a runaway best effort they ever produced. Nothing comes close to 'Alice in WOnderland' in Disney's arsenal of cartoons. Alice is superb and all the characters and creatures come to life in a way that is staggering on the limit of imagination.<br /><br />The Walrus and the Carpenter (Little Oysters! Little Oysters!\\")is a favorite scene as is the Mad Tea Party. Does anyone know why at the end of 'Mad Watch! Mad Watch!' there is a second of black and white while the watch dies? I had the VHS version and now the DVD Masterpiece and it still has that one second of film in which it goes black and white. Oh well, the watch was two days slow anyway.<br /><br />One can enjoy this adventure as a child, but adults can love this film as well. Like Rocky Horror, you can have a party and have everyone dress up as a character and pass around magic mushrooms just like Alice has. My girlfriend looks real sexy in her Alice outfit and she loves me when I dress up as Bill the Lizard.<br /><br />The king of all is not the King of Hearts, but rather the catepillar. He has his magic hookah and teaches ALice all the recitals that any school girl should know. The part when Alice tries to finally decide to go home is awesome as well because Tulgi Wood is filled with an amazing assortment of creatures that would drive anyone mad. The birdcage bird is a favorite as are the umbrella vultures. The Chesire Cat is in full swing and loves the madness he lives in and is a part of.<br /><br />The Queen of Hearts is a madwoman with a fetish for beheading. That'll teach you to plant the white roses by mistake! I have heard that this movie seriously bombed back in the 50's because Alice was not the heroine similar to Snow White or Cinderella. Fortunately teenagers and adults caught on and it is a favorite of the older crowd.<br /><br />I love this cartoon and think it's better than Toy Story, The Little Mermaid, and Nemo combined.
140004281X|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, Runaway resonates in the mind of the reader with a force that is usually attributed to the concussive thump of a powerful novel. I would agree, it is as though we are getting eight compressed novels in Runaway... six, to be precise, since three of the stories are sequentially connected to each other.<br /><br />So wonderful is her characterization and style that I would have remained interested, if any story had been expanded to be the length of a novel.<br /><br />Having only read one other Munro collection (Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage), I am no expert on her work. However, I would say that I enjoyed this book more than the other, simply because these stories seem to me to have a better resolve about them. They close, but they are not closed. Fine-tuned, their open-ended endings beg to be reflected upon. Runaway was an excellent source of near-endless discussion in my own elite Book Club of Two.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any and all. I was thrilled to happen to have my TV on one evening, to see the elegant Alice rise and accept the Giller Prize, for Runaway.  I joined in the applause, and startled the cat.<br /><br />The stories are centered around the lives and experiences of women, that is to say, women are the protagonists of each story. As a male reader, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the themes, the motifs, the relevance and style of each story, and conclude that Munro is not a writer only FOR women. Men who enjoy the very best that writing has to offer us today, should read her.<br /><br />I think my own favorite story was Tricks. The twist of fate, the \\"trick\\" in this story alone, is worth the acquisition of and reading of this book.<br /><br />Runaway is unforgettably good, and makes me want to go on and explore all things Munrovian. The wonderland of Alice Munro.
B00005OCMR|5.0|This is the Holy Grail for geeks everywhere. There are still those, out there, somewhere, who remember the patterns to last while playing the Tron video game.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is digitized and broken down into the MCP. The evil, evil MCP who has a henchman that is just as diabolical. His journey begins in a cell where he must fight others in computer combat games. But Jeff's advantage is that he is a 'user', a person that uses computers of course. His opponants are actually computer programs. You know like accounting programs and such. So if this ever happens to you, just remember never, never, ever lose your disc.<br /><br />Jeff and Crew make their escape during a light cycle battle. Now the light cycles were extremely cool. Everbody loved the light cycles. They turned only at 90 angles and left a wall of solid light that you had to avoid to survive.<br /><br />Now after the escape, I'm not sure where one would find a pond of water to drink while inside a computer, but it must have been good to let your costume glow like that. Speaking of the costumes, they were very cool. The chick with the skin-tight TRON outfit had a great little wiggle when she walked.<br /><br />So OK, we see some grand poobah who remembers the MCP when he was a chess program, then we set sail on some kind of pirate ship with sails that follow a lightbeam to the MCP. It is there and only there that the great battle of good vs. evil can begin. TRON saves the day by knocking out the barrier and throwing his disc into the heart of the MCP.<br /><br />Wow! It doesn't get much more exciting than this folks. I mean this flick will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end when you see Jeff running the company. You see he's a game designer who's ideas were stolen. Anyway, you children of the 80's will love to see this again.
B000003TA4|5.0|It's amazing that 10 years after Kurt's death I am now writing a review for one of the greatest albums of all time. From this point on music would never be the same, and to think it started even earlier. After hearing this album I picked up Bleach, and I'll tell you what... You just knew even greater things would come, if only for a short time. It's a shame the group as a whole was only around for a short time, but it was a great period in time for music that really shook things up and got a lot of groups after to fire up those guitars, like the equally great Foo Fighters. Kurt, we wish you we're still here but the memories will live on. By the way, your wife is doing fine, her last album was her best yet and the little \\"Bean\\" is a cutie. R.I.P.
0452285186|4.0|Ever wonder what bunnies do when we go to sleep? Plot their suicides, of course! Not quite, but Andy Riley's concept is a fresh stab at humor straight out of the United Kingdom. The suicides range from outrageous to clever to painful, but practically all of them get the job done, which is making someone say \\"Aww.\\" Whether that \\"aww\\" is of dispair for the bunnies or of heartwarmth from the intelligence put into the plotting is debatable, but one thing is for sure: people like bunnies. And if you appreciate Python jokes, you'll like bunnies committing suicide.
B00003CXFV|5.0|A neat film about how a rather ordinary person without direction decides to \\"do something with her life\\" and take on a huge corporation for environmental injustice.  People are sick and dieing by drinking and using water with a toxic form of chromium in their water wells.  How did it get there?  It got there by PG&E's thoughtless use of the toxin in their plants.  It all started before 1966 - the corporate office knew, but didn't do anything about it.  It's a classic case of turning a blind eye to a huge environmental problem to save the bottom line.  It's an example of a big, faceless, powerful economic force not caring for the little guy - just as long these same little guys pay their bills and add to the profit margin of the company.  The film is an eye-opener in illustrating how big business does all it can to make a buck at the expense of humankind and the environment.  A movie I recommend to the environmentally conscious.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|<br />The review the one of the Top 500 Amazon reviewers here mentions Jason Bourne makes an obvious mistake by using a passport with JASON BOURNE on it making it easy for the bad guys to find him. <br /> <br />Just wanted to mention that I thought the film made it absolutely clear that Bourne knew what he was doing.  He knew using that passport would draw a lot of heat, but he needed to draw it in order to find out what was going on.   <br /> <br />That's why he didn't say a word until someone came to him bringing something useful (a weapon and a SIM card to copy).
0767802519|4.0|While this story requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (all that shooting, for instance, would have attracted immediate attention from neighbors and the authorities), the portrayals of the characters are superb.  Young Natalie Portman was particularly stellar.  Cynics might suggest that the child she played could never in real life have had the focus and desire to have learned the assassin's trade (as tought to her by The Professional) -- but such thinking collapses if you consider that the real-life Natalie had all the personal discipline necessary for making this film, and doing such a great job of it, at her youthful age.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I saw this DVD  almost 2 -3 years ago. <br />My first impression was not very favourable. However, after seeing the DVD after a break, it seems a lot more palatable. Enjoyed it immensely. Very hard to  access as I recall on a first viewing, but seeing it again the filme resonates more. <br />An amazing, touching, and expansive film.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album has continually blown me away over the last year.  Not only does the album possess very technical music, but it brings an atmosphere reminiscent of Pink Floyd.  The Mars Volta is by far the most talented and original band to appear in recent years, and if you're a fan of progressive and talented music you HAVE to pick this album up.  Those who say this album is incoherent, technical noise do not have the mind for truly progressive music, which is exactly what the Mars Volta delivers.
0783225857|3.0|This film is beautiful in its intent; how a white lawyer defends a black man wrongly accused of rape.  Also, Atticus' relationship with his children (played wonderfully by the two young actors in the film) is precious to see.  That said, I find the film too slow-moving for my taste. I am a big Gregory Peck fan, but the pacing of this gem cannot sustain my interest.  I've seen it a number of times (more recently, this evening, in fact)..and while some parts of the film cause me to stop what I'm doing and take notice, other parts do not.  In addition, the courtroom scene is too painful to watch..not because I am bored to tears, necessarily, but because I cannot stand hearing the testimony of the woman who claims to have been assaulted by an innocent black man.  I find her blatant lies unnerving to hear and her whole testimony highly irritating. Either the actress who plays her can't act, or she's so good it makes me want to clobber her, but I hate that scene. <br /> <br />To me, the best part of the film is simply watching Gregory Peck and the two young actors who play his children..but as for the story itself..though moral and good, it seems rather disjointed and you wonder what's the point. Great film in what it tries to accomplish, but clumsy and convoluted (imo) in its execution.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|I have but one single question to ask about this collection . . .<br /><br />Will it be revealed anywhere that the Wachowski brothers, who are admitted VERTIGO COMICS fans, actually plagiarized VERTIGO COMICS series THE INVISIBLES, by Grant Morrison?<br /><br />If you want to read about THE REAL MATRIX, then you must check out THE INVISIBLES! It is a MUCH BETTER STORY and it does NOT get progressively horrible the closer one gets to the end of the story, as does The Matrix.<br /><br />Finally, if you don't know who Grant Morrison is or who THE INVISIBLES are, then please do yourself a favor and check it out!<br /><br />The Ultimate Matrix Collection = 1 star<br /><br />The Invisibles Graphic Novel Series = 100 stars (out of five!)
0529064847|5.0|I own the Amplified Bible, the New International Version Bible, the Oxford's World Bible KJV, and the Jewish Tanakh Old Testament, but this is my favorite Bible by far.  <br /> <br />There are some problems with this Bible ofcourse.  Goliath, who was killed by King David, was not 6 feet tall only.  Atleast, I think he was quite a bit taller--atleast 8 feet tall.  And I don't care for a lot of the notes written in this Bible by Catholic scholars.  If you have ever read the Golden Legend, you know that Leviathan spoken about in the Book of Job is actually a dynosaur like T. Rex. yet the notes written in this Bible make him out to be just a crocodile.  There is a lot of Catholic dogma written in the explanatory notes that I just don't care for, and that I probably will never care for.   <br /> <br />However, besides the above mentioned problems, this Bible is one of the best translations ever--in fact, it is the best for me since it is so easy on my eyes.  I love this Bible. I love the smell of the tan paper and printed ink in this Bible when you flip through the pages quickly that you can't find in many other Bible's out there.  It smells fresh off the press. <br /> <br />There is also one problem that I don't like in all the Bibles I own: the editors love to subtitle and write notes into the Book of Revelation, and we Christians have been warned to never add anything, or take away anything, from the Book of Revelation.  It's a sad generation that we live in when sholars just dismiss such a warning as superstition.
B00005M91K|5.0|I did like it how one of us said here that this is a film made by a director who is, although very talented, an alien. <br /> <br />There is this unhuman impartiality in the film that allows a lot  of us to see it not as a message, but as a collection of unrelated beautiful and disturbing (to us) images, all of which try to paint for the alien traveler a picture of our world as inclusive as possible. <br /> <br />This view of life on Earth through an alien's eyes is somewhat distressing - it seems so objective. This film shows that nature does not understand, does not accept human definitions of right or wrong, ugly or beautiful, and it makes us wonder how much our individual lives and our individual values are really worth.

0385504209|3.0|A secret brotherhood, ancient history and art, a harvard professor of iconography called in to assist in a murder investigation, a beautiful & intelligent woman who is related to the murder victim helps him, a race against time to find clues to avoid something hugely disasterous, etc... this might all sound familiar if you have already read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS! He has used the same formula and simply substituted different details - too bad...it could have been so much better! It is shallow enough to make a great movie though as long as they cast French actors and not American pretending to be French...

B00006BTCA|5.0|I like this album a great deal and have given it five stars - but sometimes when an Interpol song emerges on my iTunes or my iPod I think, \\"Huh, what Joy Division song is this? I don't recognize it.\\" Then I look and see it is (for example) *Roland* from this Interpol album. So, to the other reviewers, I would advise that you quit saying, \\"stop the Joy Division comparisons,\\" because, for me anyway, the feeling is visceral - for people my age (45) this band really does sound like a continuation of the Joy Divison discography - not a bad thing, either.
B000059XUO|2.0|This was a movie that I was hoping for a lot from, and it delivered.  The problem is that it didn't deliver in the right places and didn't do the story any justice. <br /> <br />The story is one of revenge.  The main character, eric draven, was going to be married to his sweetheart.  When a bunch of degenerates break in and kill him and his girlfriend in a brutal manner.  All seems to be forgotten until the one year after the event, then Eric is raised from the dead and returns for vengence. <br /> <br />The original comic book was gritty, violent, and filled with dark poetry and philosophy.  The movie had the feeling of something that MTV would produce, more of a collecion of music videos than a cohesive movie.  The editing is poor, the directing was worse, the characters were two dimensional and often annoying, the dialogue weak, and turned an interesting story into a shallow action flick on par with Johhny Mneumonic or Demolition Man. <br /> <br />In the original, there was no point to the original murders.  They were just on the highway and were unlucky enough to run into a pack of degenerates.  Funboy had a much bigger role and assisted in the death of T bird.  Top dollar wasn't into black magic, he was a crack dealer that was one of the first to go.  One of the biggest differences is that Eric Draven in the comic was like an angel of death, he knew what he was about and why he was there.  In the movie he was a confused metalhead that stumbles through the movie.  Plus the whole idea of Eric being a musician that was going to get married on Halloween was just cheesy, trying way too hard to package him for the metal/goth crowd. <br /> <br />I give this a two stars for the fact that it was a pretty movie, and it had some good action sequences.   <br />
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Okay, insert obvious Radiohead comparison comment here.  You cannot listen to this album and not think Thom Yorke is singing a lot of it.  That does not translate into a negative however. <br /> <br />This album is very good.  It is not great.  The problems are such: <br /> <br />It is overproduced.  The songs are over-the-top at times.  There are such layers of production here that Queen would listen and say \\"a bit pretentious there, eh chaps?\\"  I would like to have heard another track or two NOT be given the \\"let's make it a huge wall of sound\\" production process.  As is, there is really only one song that isn't massively overdubbed and \\"filled in.\\"  (Falling Away With You) <br /> <br />Singularity.  What I mean by this is that many of the songs sound like  extensions of other songs on the record.  On the first listen, I was able to tell exactly what note would come next, simply because the band had done that same kind of musical progression earlier on the album.  It is as if they had a singular song idea for the record and simply expanded it into 14 tracks. <br /> <br />Now, what's good: <br /> <br />They really do have a beautiful sound.  For such a young band, they are well refined.  The singer has great range, and they are extremely tight.  There is a great energy in this band and they possess something that all too many bands lack these days:  the ability to create melody.  This translates into emotion.   <br /> <br />In a musical landscape of crap like Nickelback, Yellowcard and a thousand other soundalikes, it is so refreshing to hear a band that gives two craps about creating music that actually makes the listener feel something. <br /> <br />This is a band that definitely has found \\"their sound.\\"  They are obviously confident in what they are doing and have crafted some really catchy and emotive music here.  I am going to try to catch them at the Wiltern Theater in December to see how well they pull it off live.
0802130208|5.0|Ignatius is a beastly, repulsive, pompous character who, regardless of how disgusting and annoying, we become irresistably interested in.  His character is completely absurd- an almost monstruous exaggeration of a real person- and yet believable at the same time.  The reader becomes so familiar with his hilarious eccentricities, with his so-called world view that we begin to see him as a real part of our lives.  While we can come to expect his gastro-intestinal problems, his devotion to the rules of theology and geometry, his demand for taste and decency, we are also constantly surprised and appalled by his unimaginable originality and wacky behavior.  Knowing Ignatius so intimately, we are irritated by him, we  sympathize with him, we detest him, we are attracted to him.  He is completely out of place amongst the illiterate New Orleans neighborhood he lives in, but somehow makes it seem as though it is the rest of society that is out of place-- not him.  And this absurdity is what makes the novel so comical.  Just imagining a character like Ignatius would be amusing, but Toole's ability to convince the reader of such a nutty character makes the book hilarious.
B00005JLKN|5.0|If you liked \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" this is a must see!  Hannibal was a bit too graphic for my taste, so this movie brought back the class that was originally found in \\"Lambs.\\"  Anthony Hopkins portrays Lector with genius and sophistication, and Edward Norton should be noted for his excellent performance as well.  Great movie!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Isn't it funny how sometimes...people don't have a life. I mean, this \\"Coldjustice\\" reviewer comes on everyday, either to add to a review, or post a new one. If their life is based on bashing a legend, then how low can they get? <br /> <br />Obviously, they have nothing else to do. So, we minus well ignore them. The fans outnumber the sad haters. This review was helpful. Also, what's sad is that people come on to mark reviews as \\"not helpful\\".  <br /> <br />Another example: On the first page or so, they came back to add to a review in response to another fan. How sad. <br /> <br />This album on the other hand, is not a rip off. Its not a complitation repackaged again. Look what it has to offer. Over 30 rare songs, and new songs.  <br /> <br />The best by far is \\"We've Had Enough\\". \\"Fall Again\\" was promoted by VH1, as it is a beautiful slow song. Take a look at the complete tracklisting. There are more rare songs, than repackaged songs. And remember: THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina did a wonderful job on her first ever christmas cd. Her voice is very nice with a lot of the songs. Merry Christmas is too slow for me but everything is else is wonderful. I like that she did a mix to the christmas song it sounds great. This is a treat for all Christina fans and if you like christmas than pick it up.
0380788624|1.0|Let me start by saying I am not a quiter but I came dangerously close to putting this book down numerous times. I muddled through just to satisfy my \\"I finished the book\\" tendencies. The author should fire his editor because this book could be trimmed down to 300 pages max. The ending was rediculous, total cop out. Yes the sophomoric humor was peppered throughout but you cant polish a turd. If you like techno thrillers read someone else who understands the editing process.  <br />Nuff said.
B000002NFM|5.0|Even if you have no idea who Prodigy is, it is a virtual certainty that you have heard at least one song from this CD.  The whole first half of the CD is composed of nothing but outstanding songs.  Even if you are not an electronic music fan, I think you would be hard-pressed to not enjoy at least 2 or 3 songs from this album.  Highly recommended.
0802130208|2.0|I chose this title for my review for two reasons: I believe that the book is highly overrated and not worth the critical praise it has received and because it ties in with the gross mentions of bodily functions that come up repeatedly in the story. <br />Maybe it is only a difference in type of sense of humor, but I did not find this book to be funny at all. Sure it was a relatively easy read as Toole uses simple and flowing language, but the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, whom many consider to be hilarious, only serves to make me angry. Ignatius is supposed to be a \\"genius\\" but he is the most immature character in any book that I have read in a long time. Ignatius went to college and even earned a Masters Degree, but he still has no steady job, lives with his mother, and gets car sick almost every time he is in a moving vehicle. He is a huge, fat, disgusting baby who goes through life thinking he is better than everyone else, as if he is the Second Coming or something.  Ignatius treats his own mother like garbage, demanding things from her and ordering her around when really he is dependent upon her. This is one of the reasons I hated Ignatius, because he doesn't show any respect to anyone, even those who care for him. <br />The parts of the book that are supposedly funny are nothing more than ridiculous exaggerations and gross details. The incredible thing is that I have actually witnessed people laugh at loud at such nonsense as Ignatius falling while an employee of Mr. Levy, and then being such a baby that he thought he was paralyzed when really he was only too fat to stand up. The details such as Ignatius masturbating to the thought of his old dog is not funny; it is sick. I don't know what gave Toole that idea but it is just not right. Many of the situations Ignatius finds himself in are so absurd and unreal that they seem crazy and unbelievable instead of funny as they were obviously intended to be. <br />While the book does read quickly, I found myselfbored after only about twenty pages. I actually fell asleep reading this book, not once, but twice. Ignatius is annoying and disgusting, what with his \\"valve\\" problem and everything, and the exact opposite of a true \\"genius.\\" The only character that I remotely liked in the story was Jones, the black man who could never catch a break in life, but always seemed to know his place. <br />The setting for the book, New Orleans, was a good choice for this story which had potential, but just didn't follow through on it. It is too bad that Toole died such an untimely death before he was given a chance to redeem himself. I hated this book, possibly because of a different taste in humor or possibly because I was forced to read it for a class. I did not find it funny at all. I didn't laugh at loud. I didn't even smirk. For those who loved this book, I am very happy for you, that you were able to take a pointless book with no real plot and find enjoyment in it. Congratulations.
0802130208|4.0|I really enjoyed Ignatius as a character in the novel, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\".  He reminded me of another character from one of my favorite literary works, \\"Don Quixote\\".  They both wander around in seemingly odd outfits trying to right the wrongs of society.  Ignatius seems to live his life as if the world revolves around him.  Because of this, I initially disliked his character, as many people do.  However, if you are able to get past Ignatius' egotistic personality, you might find him to be quite a hilarious character.  His actions and ideas highly absurd, and he can very easily turn a normal situation into a disaster.  For example, during Ignatius' first days of work he is asked to do some filing.  While attempting to use a stool and tool recommended by another staff member, he falls to the floor and supposedly hurts his back.  Now, his back isn't really injured, but he makes it out to seem as if he is dying.  From here, the comedy only grows as his complaints and actions become more absurd.  Reading this, we would not want to be the one there to deal with Ignatius, but thinking of it happening to someone else gives it a comical effect.  As many have said, comedy can only be funny if it is happening to someone else. <br />     As for the novel itself, I think readers are generally at one end of the spectrum or the other; you either love it or hate it.  I also think that the opinion of the novel is strongly dependent on the reader's view of Ignatius.  If all you see is an annoying, repulsive man in a red coat and green hunting cap, then you would probably dislike the book as well.  You probably couldn't find humor in Ignatius' actions, and since the story is centered on Ignatius, it would also be hard to find the novel funny.  Personally, I enjoyed Ignatius as a character, once I got past my initial reactions to him.  I began to see the comedy in his actions and, at time, could really picture some of the unusual scenes as they unfolded.  Once I did this,the book became much more enjoyable as well. <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|I confess, I'm a sixty-year-old Harry Potter fan.  Love the books, loved movies number one and two.  I'm really disappointed in the third film though.  Rearrangements of locations in the film leave a slightly uncomfortable feel as they appear.  The excessive darkness of the sets does more to disorient than it does to create a sense of *presence* or tension.    <br />I understand the change in directors and, thus, direction but it went too far, not allowing the third film to blend seamlessly with the first and second.  This may seem a small matter now but it will inevitably lead to some failures in the series when they are watched together in order by those of us who are fans and decide to invite everyone over, including the grandkids, for a Harry Potter Fest.   <br />I've read and heard comments about the acting being more mature in this film.  Hmm, could that be because the actors themselves are more mature and the characters they are playing are just plain growing up?   <br />Again, I'm disappointed.  Not disappointed enough to make me abandon Harry and Company but disappointed enough that I didn't bother to see this one several times at the theater like I did the other two.  We will see about the fourth film...........
0671510991|5.0|<br />One assumes a good understanding of world history to read the \\"Diplomacy\\" by Henry Kissinger. In this wonderful book, the author streamlines the history of modern world politics and international policies through a documentary-like depiction of world diplomacy. In an unique perspective,  Kissinger writes this book through eyes of diplomats, how they strive for the international goal set by their country, how policies initiates the interaction and sentiments among the world community, and how previous leaders' agreements  produces the results in modern world structure.  As the book discloses, in a constant effort to create a favorable international environment, countries are constantly struggling with each other, militarily, economically, and politically through diplomacy for their goals. Thus this convoluted relation leads to war, sanctions, alliances and periodically adjusts the power-balance system in regions.  <br /> Of course, without the broad knowledge of modern world history, I think the book is difficult to digest. One got to know when and what has happened through the time before they tries to understand what the diplomacy were about. Though Kissinger includes large amount of details telling about motives of international policies and the reasoning behind leader conferences, it would be extremely arduous for one to understand the scope of world politics without knowing sequential facts of events in historical view.  Kissinger's analyze of modern world structure as result of World War II and Cold War is very objective; he was excellent at writing about the constant changing tension of power balance during Cold War through an effective analytical view over Western Europe, Soviet Union, and America's political thoughts both internationally and domestically. As a senior expert in international relations, he examines the world politics with a thorough view, and paid extremely details in each conflicting nation's own domestic sentiments and politics, therefore to reason how those domestic conditions pushed forwarded an international agendas imbued of concern for selfish goals and worries of security among countries.  <br />In this book, Kissinger offers an insider perspective, construing the history and thoughts that gradually transformed American and European Foreign Policy for hundreds of years. He defines the modern political arena as the by-product of historical struggles among conflicting powers. As we learn the come and goes of age of empires, replaced by the age of alliances and opposition alliances, world politics is aiming at power-balance and constantly adjust accordingly. When one side is too strong, the others unite together to counter it; and when one side is weak, it efforts to form a mutual relationship with other weak nations for a stronger line.  When it comes to Cold War, Kissinger explicitly discloses the fear among Western Europe and the United States in the expansion of Soviet communism, and how they come together for agreements that lead to military alliance and economical integrations which erect the opposing wall against U.S.S.R. This fear, gives justification for military intervention in even small countries such as Vietnam and Korea, defines how balance is significantly important to super powers even in minor regional issues.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />As the book draws to its end, it is obvious that Kissinger is pointing out that in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union; Unite States is emerging as an unchallengeable world super power. Her status as the greatest power on the Earth continues to shape world policy undisputedly and setting up an unbalanced new world order. American ideology of freedom and democracy, righteousness and the ideals of self-determination are being exported world wide just as American military power exerts  tremendous amount of pressure around the globe ensuring a system of stability under the new world order.  Yet, as \\"Diplomacy\\" tells stories of Cold War with records of facts and diplomatic maneuverings, United States has been wining big in world influence long before the actual collapse of Soviet Union.  In an apparent contrary to USA, Soviet was establishing the power of influences through harsh military and political pressures; although its expansionist policy yields the Warsaw Pact etc, the membership of its alliance was based on coercions without will. Both America and Soviet was bearing huge amount of economic burden to offer foreign aid and assistances to other countries; however the result was different, as USA and its allies builds an integrated economy while soviet was pressing for a socialist agenda. Thus in the long run, America and her allies are growing to prosperity with a good cause, while Soviet hardship in economy and difficulties controlling the puppet governments through coercion finally leads it to collapse. That same reason American values are being flourished around globe while Soviet idealism crushed in the face of own failure.  <br />Although Contender like Charles A. Kupchan in \\"The End of The American Era\\" offers very fundamental analysis over the integration of Europe as a new emerging super power counter-balance to the United States after the Cold War. His perspective is far from convincing. Though a more united Europe forms a stronger figure for U. S. foreign policy thinkers and practitioners to heed, the effect is very minimum. As a super nation, American economical, military power has gain its world status and puts derive on European cultures. Even with the newly integrated Europe Union, 47 out of 50 U.S. states are individually stronger than EU in term of gross domestic product. With such a hanging gap, it is doubtful that how this new European power ever offers equal pressures to United States. Meanwhile, as Kissinger's analysis shows, European powers are always pressured to form such union to bargain for their particular diplomatic goal, yet among themselves, different  culture, economic struggles are constantly being present as a force to counteract their own political ties. Europe, being small geographically, is incredible diverse in their history, culture and ideology. Therefore it is hard to imagine how it would manage to overcome all the differences and really unite together as a strong figure. While that's in indefinite thoughts, America, with its vast resourceful land mass, a much bigger population, and an unchallengeable power to influence every corner in the world is a much better candidate for the leader of future as well. This hegemony status is hard to flip back easily.  <br /> I highly recommend this book as a high-level reference literature to learn about historical events in a unique perspective. This book is also great for the study of international relation, geopolitics, and political psychology as it gives a good explanation of the modern international political economy. Understanding this book will offer good background for one to understand the motives behind many international policies and domestic reforms. \\"Diplomacy\\" is extremely detailed, very sequentially and logically written; it lays out the context of world politics in an unprecedented perspective. In many aspects, this is also a marvelous material for studying political arena of the world as Kissinger offers so much primary source information in this book. This book is insightful, miraculously revealing the back bones of decision made by world leaders. Its logical reasoning is hardly disputable. As the modern world progress to a more interactive international community where one affects others as a more daily dose of practice, it would be wise to understand the conduction of diplomacy and how it synchronizes with changes around the globe.  <br />
0060392886|5.0|This book is wild. I was always a Van Halen fan as a kid, so I wasn't too into Motley Crue to be honest, but this book was so cool. The lives of that band and some of the stories are insane. Looking for something to gawk at? Wanna see what it's like to rock out with the Cure? Read this!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I think the wheels of inspiration have well and truly fallen off for Dream Theater. This album and it's previous, are a series of tired and wornout formulas the band have slowly subscribed themselves to. Each new album seems to be more dated and cliched than the previous and this is really sad considering the talent and technical abilities the band posesses.  <br />James Labrie has become an object of prodictability with such primative vocal phrasing, that dare I say, sound not too unlike James Hetfields approach in the mid to late 80's. Labrie possessed such an amazing range and sang original melodies on both 'Images and Words' and 'Awake' but it seems that the last few years he has been in a creative doldrum......so has the rest of the band for that matter. It's time for a little reinvention I say! <br /> <br />This review is not designed to be cruel for the sake of nastiness but a genuine expression of disappointment in a band I was once stimulated and inspired by.  <br />    <br />This 'Train Of Thought' is severely wondering!
B00005R2M3|5.0|this cd is absolutely great. from day one when i bought this cd when i was 15 (i'm 19 now) i've never stopped loving it its always been one of my top 5 favorite cds. i can listen to this cd start to finish and never get sick of it. i think Shakira is a very talented amazing artist and this cd will always stand out to me.
B000089RVX|2.0|The only song I like is Imaginary(specially the version from Origin). But if it wasn't for Imaginary, I would give this cd 1 star. Amy Lee's voice irritates me on most of the songs. It sounds..fake. Like she is wringing/twisting/bending her voice.   And this isn't real gothic either(for the peeps who are labeling this as gothic).  There are better bands out there, so don't hang on this one.  EDIT: and oh yeah..raping My Tourniquet(Soul Embraced cover) is the worst part.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|If you like pop/dance music and singing along to your cd then this cd might work for you. my favorite tracks are \\"feelin' so good\\", \\"should've never\\", \\"open off my love\\", and \\"it's not that serious\\", and especially \\"let's get loud\\" great upbeat track.  alot of ballads yes, but definetely some good upbeat tracks.
0425098478|5.0|I heard the One-Minute Manager on audio tape a number of years ago and I liked what Ken said.  \\"If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.\\"  Awesome.
B000009CEM|5.0|This cd truly has its moments. Several of the songs include mindless metal riffs, and aren't very solid; on the other hand the cd holds a few truly amazing songs and really intricate beats. The best songs would include Descent, Edgecrusher, Freedom or Fire and Resurrection. These songs, specially Resurrection, are really inspireing pieces. Descent's, and Freedom or Fire's guitar riffs are excellent; Edgecrusher has a bass/drum bridge which shows how Fear Factory is not just guitar driven. Resurrection is truly a masterpiece in itself, and nothing more can be said. Overall, there are a few gems found in this cd with many undeveloped rocks. Why would I give this album 5 stars then? Well I for one would rather have a solid cd with some weak songs then no cd at all. <br /> <br />P.S I would probably give 5 stars just for Resurrection and Descent alone, because the songs are THAT good.
B000002I8H|5.0|If you're a radical Jazz vocal fan, forget it! If you search for a good reason to prove how can a big vocalist play its role perfectly and independently of material, this is a must!<br /><br />I love Jazz, I love Jazz vocal but most of all I love Good Music and I love Sarah Vaughan. This the real good spirit on listening this album of inventive and pop swinging (yes, pop!) arrangements by the late great Marty Paich which wraps Vaughan's voice beautifully.<br /><br />A wide variety of moods makes up this set. From romantic 'And I Love Her' and 'The Long and Winding Road' to the swingers 'Get Back' (a sensational opening just to tell you: - Stand up and move, baby!) and 'Come Together'. Also a Bossa Nova made out of 'Something' with the collaboration of Marcos Valle, the great Bossa Nova composer and singer who wrote and sang Portuguese lyrics along with Ms. Vaughan's English lines.<br /><br />Ok. Material is Beatles'. Swinging Beatles, dig it?
1878424114|5.0|Chopra does an excellent job relaying the message that every person is a part of the greater universe. As with his other books, he brings his point forth philosophically. And does a great job at convincing the reader of his point. Excellent book. Wish I had picked it up earlier.
0804102988|5.0|I purchased this book when it was first published and I have just re-read it, something I cannot ever remember doing with a work of fiction. <br />To try to do a concise synopsis of the book is virtually impossible because this is an epic volume. Suffice to say that the book begins approx 7000 BC in the ice age and ends in modern times. The book covers the lives of 5 families through the centuries and while you are reading the gripping story you are also receiving a history lesson on the formation of the British Isles, its buildings and people, (if only they were like this at school). <br />Rutherford takes you through the centuries in a magical way, the main character in the book is not a person but a building (Salisbury Cathedral). The trials and tribulations of the people who lovingly build it and work in it. <br />If you are interested in historial novels, you have got to read this one.
0802130208|3.0|Is Ignatius J. Reilly a tragic hero?  Well, he certainly has tragic flaws.  He is obese, loud, obnoxious, careless, rude, condescending, irresponsible, and annoying.  His entire life is a blur of mishaps, movies, television, [...].  There is not a single instance in which he commits a selfless or useful act.  Ignatius might be a genius of sorts, but I refuse to consider him a hero.  He is a hate-filled, selfish narcissist who thinks his burps don't stink.     Should Reilly be considered a genius because the world seems to be in a confederacy against him?  The narrator certainly seems to think so.  The title of the novel, A Confederacy of Dunces, suggests that Ignatius is a diamond in the rough. Throughout the story, Mrs. Reilly talks about people who have a hard path.  In fact, the most difficult path of all is that of the reader attempting to muddle through this book.  The plot is intriguing to some extent, and this novel is filled with good comedy.  But the main character is so grotesque, so hard to deal with, that it is almost impossible to stomach his abhorring existence for the simple pleasure of a few laughs.  I can only hope that Toole's featured character is based purely in fiction.   Ignatius J. Reilly is a villain, not a hero.  He actually attempts to bring bodily harm upon poor Mr. Gonzalez, who was nothing but nice and hospitable throughout the novel.  This story is set in a time when colored people were discriminated against harshly.  But the colored factory workers actually show more class and intelligence than Ignatius could ever embrace when they abandon his quest for Moorish dignity.  The most frustrating part of the story is when Ignatius becomes a hotdog vendor.  He could make money so easily, and he proves this by actually selling all his hotdogs one day.  Instead, he muddles around and embraces the \\"poor me\\" outlook on life.  He is so pathetic he can't even help himself.  Still, I don't know how any reader would feel pity for Ignatius.     Justwhen it seems Ignatius can't get any worse, he is confronted by Mr. Levy.  Instead of confessing to the letter, or making up some wild story, Ignatius is cold hearted enough to accuse Miss Trixie of writing it.  As if her life wasn't horrible enough, he felt obligated to shovel another heap of manure on her wagon.  By the end of the novel, I found myself desperately hoping Ignatius would meet some violent or horrible demise.  I wanted his escape attempt with Myrna to fail so he could be taken away to the mental hospital.  I wanted to see Ignatius rot for all the horrible things he had done.   Ignatius is so mechanical it's funny.  This character is a beautiful illustration of Henri Bergson's theory of comedy, as presented in Laughter.  Ignatius is predictable and unoriginal.  He is someone we can all laugh at, but certainly not someone we should consider heroic.  I respect the fact that he is different from the rest of the world and doesn't conform simply to fit in.  People should aspire to be more like Reilly in the way he doesn't let other people influence him.  You can't always worry about how you are perceived by other people.  But in Ignatius' case, his fierce independence and singularity is not admirable at all because he refuses to develop as a person.  He won't leave New Orleans (until he is forced to), he won't open up to anyone, and he reacts the same way to everything he encounters.          Under the bloated, dirty, ugly surface, Ignatius J. Reilly is nothing more than a simple minded coward.  His vocabulary is impressive; his ideas are unique in the time in which he lives.  But Ignatius is basically a child in a fat man's body.  He is motivated by the wild fantasies in which he lives.  He is completely dependent upon his poor alcoholic mother.  He has no intentions to ever better himself or society in any realistic way; instead he remains absorbed in ancient fantasy tales.  His belief in Fortuna best sums up his existence: a refusal to take any kind ofresponsibility (ever) and a complete lack of motivation in life.  Ignatius J. Reilly is the most tasteless and indecent character I have ever encountered.  With all the vagrants and criminals in New Orleans, Toole's only shortcoming was that he never allowed Ignatius to catch a knife in the ribs, or worse.           A Confederacy of Dunces is a worthwhile read, if only to learn how awful a person can be.  Ignatius is absolutely despicable and disgusting, but he is funny nonetheless.  This is an absolutely unique novel and a first rate comedy, but I haven't so strongly disliked a character since I read excerpts from Mein Kampf.
B000002JR8|5.0|Metal albums just don't get any better than this!! FAR BEYOND DRIVEN tapped into a rhythm that really had never been displayed in the industry. Dimebag's guitar cuts are unique,sharp and complimented well by Vinnie's SICK A$$ DRUM ROLLS!! For PANTERA NEW-COMERS you need to pick up this album. THEIR BEST...HANDS DOWN!
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead is my personal favorite band.  They are aesthetically pleasing, stimulate my intellectual curiosity, and many of their songs resonate with my disaffected view of the world.   <br /> <br />Hail to the Thief is perhaps the most polished Radiohead album vocally and instrumentally.  Thom Yorke sings in very unique ways but demonstrates precise control over his voice.  For example, in one part of the song \\"We suck young blood,\\" (about 2 and a half minutes through) his voice demonstrates an elaborate cascade to humming.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this album contains some repetition (ex. - the ending segments of \\"Sit down, Stand Up\\", and \\"Where I end and you begin\\")   I feel the impact of some of the songs is somewhat diminished by such repetition near their ends.   <br /> <br />There are also a couple of tracks I'm not crazy about ex.-  \\"Backdrifts\\" and \\"The Gloaming\\".  But that might just be my taste - the majority of them are excellent.   <br /> <br />Like with other Radiohead albums, one of the most intellectually engaging aspects of this album for me is trying to piece together the cryptic lyrics like a puzzle.   Because the songs are so densely packed with vocal and instrumental nuances, it has great replay value. <br /> <br />The culmination of my minor complaints causes me to not hold this album with such high regard as I have for \\"The Bends,\\" \\"OK Computer,\\" and \\"Kid A.\\"  But \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is still another fascinating album from a highly original band and no fan should be without it :)   <br />
B000063DIR|1.0|I first bought this album on vinyl in 1985, then on tape in 1988 after my record became unplayable. I lost track of the tape until recently and decided to spring for the CD version of it... whoa. <br /> <br />The performances on the CD were so bad it made me think that I had been carrying around a really flawed impression of the record. So I popped in my old beat-up cassette, which definitely had lost a lot of its sound quality but it proved that the new CD's don't have the same performances on them.  <br /> <br />Simply put, this is not the Diary of a Madman which cemented Ozzy's comeback from oblivion (after getting fired from Black Sabbath for being a tone-deaf boozer). Rather, it is an attempt by Oz and Sharon to usurp justice to the original rhythm section, an insult to the fans by duping them into buying an inferior remaster and finally a sorry diss to the memory of Randy Rhoads and the interplay that existed in the original Blizzard of Ozz. <br /> <br />I feel bad even trying to sell this CD to someone becasue it doesn't do the original recording any justice. Avoid.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna attempts to take a look from the brittish point of view with this... nevermind my new kabala name... attitude.  she borrowed cher's robot voice modulator (once again), and turned up her nose at her old american self... this album's sales contributed to a new (100 square ft.) hot tub at the Hollywood Kabala Palace... (open to non-practicing celebrities only). ...obnoxious fashion bracelet required.  this album makes me thirsty... this album makes me purple.  and kinda chubby.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Cretu wanted to move on from the other Enigma albums and start something new and thats exactly what he did with Voyageur. It's missing all of the monk chants and what not so it's nowhere near Enigma 2-4. It's closer to Enigma 1. Some songs sound jazzy. Overall it's good. If your a true Enigma fan I feel you'll like this. It will take time to get used to the new Enigma since we're all used to the old Enigma, but you still won't be let down from this album. <br /> <br />
B00068IOWM|2.0|Aside from 'Vertigo', this CD is pretty bad.  The songs have no good hooks, and the themes are not much better.
B00003CX95|1.0|Rob Roy is a more interesting, memorable, and accurate way to inform and entertain yourself.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I'm from the U.K where many styles of music are very popular not just one type. This girl hit the scene back in 1999 with her disco classic 'I'm outta love' and continued a string of hits wth two multi-platinum albums, Combined sales of over 10 million and nearly the whole world at her feet. Then the unthinkable happened. In early 2003, anastacia found out she had the most brutal form of breast cancer. During that time of stress she lost her voice, however she refused to give up. <br /> <br />In early 2004 Anastacia re-affirmed herself as the 'Big Voice' by coming back with 'Left outside alnone' which is one of the biggest hits of the year. Then the album was released and made it her second number 1 album and sales went through the roof.In Britain it has sold over 1 million copies which means it is nearly 4 times platinum and has stormed ever chart in Europe and Australia. The album is stunning, from the Power ballds of 'Welcome to my truth' to big rock stormers 'Left outside alone' This album grabs you by the neck and beats the hell out of you by stunning after stunning tune. An album everyone should have and one of America'a greatest singers. Trust me on this everyone else feels sorry for you becase you don't have a clue what you are missing
B00020HEG6|5.0|What a great soundtrack it does not linger on to a few themes. A Inporvement over the older Harry Potter Soundtracks.
B00005ALP6|1.0|Someone once said that with great power comes great responsibility but I suppose George Cukor never got the sense of the famous quote. The movie, an adaptation of the book My Fair Lady by the author George Bernar's Shaw, fails to portray the novelists view on society as it twists the content of the book, formatting it into a very hollywoodesque borderline furthermore, a joyful musical with now lesson whatsoever.  On a first basis the characters are a simplistic retake on the ones from the book. Eliza played by the astonishing Audrey Hepburn deviates the original character creating a shallowest one. The character does not reflect middle class morality as it falls short in demonstrating the real suffering of the deserving/undeserving poor. Her perfect pronunciation when singing (Marni Nixon) confuses the audience, and discounts the whole concept of her having an awful accent, not helping at all to pass on the notion. Further on, Mr. Higgins played by Rex Harrison enlarges the concept of charm in the character that initially had no charm at all. On the other hand it enhances decently the concept of the manly prototype but at the same type it goes way over board creating an overacted personage and at the same type failing to reflect the division of classes. As a whole the characters fail to demonstrate the main concept: social prestige presenting a Hollywood classic but not a movie based on a classic novel of the English language. Further on the classic ending of the play is cruelly twisted into the one needed to make of this movie a chick flick with out content. The ending is nothing more than a cruel made up scene that fitted correctly into the poor version by Cukor.  <br />On the other hand the movie as a production remains a complete success. The set designed to represent the typical grey London at the beginning of the century, fully addresses Shaw's desired scenery. Furthermore the dialogues are extracted in their majority from the book, helping at least in that section to remain faith to the play.  <br />To sum up, the movie is nothing more than clich version meant to be a Hollywood classic. This movie results unattractive if looked at with an English student's eye. Poor Bernard Shaw must be rolling in his grave.
B000000WF0|4.0|I'm writing about this album so long after its release because I just can't seem to find another contemporary guitar band (from the UK) whose recording matches this at the moment. <br />This album captures soul, and the songwriting is just incredible. I also find them an inspiration since they were going for years before they got the attention that they deserved... just when you think that \\"bittersweet\\" can't be topped \\"sonnet\\" comes along and grabs you from the heart... A classic cut.
B00065GX1O|1.0|The sets and costumes can frigthening you...but do not worry the worst is coming... <br />This DVD has the worst director of a filmed opera I have seen, the guy Tiziano Mancini -never forget this name- is completely in love with the conductor: Placido Domingo here. The love is so intense that he interrupts even \\"un bel d\\" to show the static maestro FOUR times, and much more serious: in Butterfly's death scene, at the moment of commit suicide itself, he prefers to show the conductor!?!?  <br />Outrageous and absurd...because the singing and mainly the drama is completely lost. <br />What a waste! Dess and Armiliato are great singers and I follow their presentations for a long time. Since this is a festival one can stand the director's madness, set designers and the absurd costumes: poor Butterfly, in her love duet have to arrange her unconfortable veil many times and keep up the voice and the acting!!! Besides this, Domingo image is imposed all the time as if HE was the main appeal! <br />Do not lose your money... do yourself a favor: run away from this DVD!
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell is, and will remain, one of the most dazzling works of fiction I have ever read.  I am still attempting to grasp all of its many intricate narrative strains, as well as the massive over all story made up of several smaller ones.  One can read this book in two ways:  As a natural reader, you will find the book immensely entertaining and complex, a book that will keep your appetite whetted until the very last page.  As a critical reader, you will notice the amazing amount of detail put into this novel, how it plays with the narrative form over and over again, how it is both a scathing socio-political commentary and a wonderful experiment with time and space.  The book is also an allegory, one which begins (and ends) with its title.  \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will leave any reader asking questions, and looking up to the clouds.
B00009TB5G|5.0|First things first, I never read any of Tolkien's novels yet, but a movie can not put every single page on screen. The movie would then become a tedious watch. Fans of the book might also complain. Hey, \\"Jurassic Park\\" didn't follow the book exactly. But overall, there hasn't been a movie that transferred every single page to the big screen. So don't complain too much. <br /> <br />Anywho, \\"The Two Towers\\" was probably the first Lord of the Rings movie I was really psyched to watch. \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was a movie I hadn't intended on watching, but since a friend said it's a \\"kickass movie,\\" I watched it and was very surprised, despite its abrupt ending. It only made me wish \\"The Two Towers\\" would be better. And surely enough, it was. <br /> <br />The movie's main \\"attraction\\" was the better character development. We begin to find out how each character personality is (although there's not much Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett scenes). And the group now being separated made that all possible. The action sequences are just amazing. The battle at Helm's Deep has such astonoshing visuals, making it the highlight of this movie. And Howard Shore's musical score... absolutely brilliant and beautiful music. <br /> <br />After viewing the movie, it right away became one of my favorite movies. Sadly, since I knew an extended version would soon be released after the theatrical cut, I wouldn't be able to watch it again for nearly a year later. But I must say, the wait was well worth it. More scenes that add to what I've described (and much more) and the extra features give me an insight of Tolkien's novels and how the movie came to what it has become. <br /> <br />\\"The Two Towers\\" also had something the other two movies seemed to lack: a decent ending. *awaits for the bashers to reply* But there was something about this movie that made me like it more than the other two. I still can't figure out what it is exactly... it's just... some feeling that I get when watching thismovie. It's a feeling that makes me think I'm watching it in theaters once again. Soon, I will know why I like this movie more than the other two... until then, I'll watch all three movies and figure out why...
B000002UVX|5.0|These six songs represent the best recorded material from four concerts by the Band of Gypsies at the Filmore East.  This music truly is Jimi Hendrix at his best.  Jimi's guitar playing is at its peak, and the songs are beautifully delivered with astonishing energy and power.  If you're new to Jimi Hendrix you may want to start with \\"Are You Experienced?\\", but if you're one of the people who has been enjoying Experience for years, it's time to check this out.
B00005JL96|5.0|\\"Lilo & Stitch\\" never really caught my attention until seeing some hilarious trailers that involved Stitch ruining moments in past Disney movies: Ariel, the lil' redheaded mermaid, sings but Stitch comes riding in on a huge tidal wave heading towards Ariel; Belle and the Beast are having their dance but lil' Stitch is on top of a chandelier that comes crashing down nearly hitting the two characters; Jasmine and Aladdin are riding on a carpet singing away when Stitch arrives on a space ship, wooing Jasmine who then rides along with Stitch, leaving Aladdin in the dust; all the animals go to Pride Rock to see Simba's ceremony, only to be greeted with Stitch. \\"Hey, that's not Simba!\\" says Timon, then the animals run off in terror and disgust. <br /> <br />And each characters' response to Stitch: Get your own movie. <br /> <br />Indeed, lil' Stitch does get his own movie. I've always heard positive responses to this movie. Anyone I knew that seen this movie loved it. Newspaper articles praised it for its humor and use of Elvis music. Ebert loved the movie, but his buddy Roeper hated it. Oh well, Ebert's the man! <br /> <br />Sadly, I wouldn't be able to view the movie myself until it was to be released on DVD.  <br /> <br />Prior to \\"Lilo & Stitch,\\" Disney didn't have the movie that really grabs you (this excludes the Pixar ones). Let's face it, \\"Atlantis\\" was a complete disaster. \\"Fantasia 2000\\" just wasn't \\"Fantasia.\\" \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\"... absolutely hilarious, I'll give 'em that. And also something lacking in Disney's trademark: musicals. Thinking of all this, I felt that \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" was going to be another disaster. <br /> <br />Once I finally bought it on DVD (I took a chance), little did I realize that I was gonna be completely amazed by the movie. The movie packs action, plenty of humor, and a charming storyline. Stitch (aka: Experiment 626) was created my a mad alien scientist to fulfill one duty: destroy everything. Both were captured and put on trial. Stitch was to be taken away, but he escapes and takes refuge on Earth in a lil' place we all know as Hawaii. There he becomes contained... in an animal shelter. A girl comes by to find a suitable pet. She finds Stitch, thinking he's a puppy. The girl's name is Lilo. And thus begins the duo's adventures, whether they'd be wacky or compassionate. <br /> <br />The movie also centers around Lilo's personal life and her relationship with her older sister. With their parents deceased, Lilo's older sister must care for the both of them. Lilo's sister, Nani, is also having a big problem with a social worker, named Cobra Bubbles (*snicker snicker*). Nani is trying to be a suitable mom for Lilo, but is faced with also losing Lilo. Pretty deep and touchy themes for a Disney movie.  <br /> <br />Lilo tries to teach Stitch some manners as well. Stitch is very short-tempered, but he learns quickly. And to add more to the duo's wacky adventures, two aliens are tracking down Stitch: the alien that created Stitch, and a counterpart who is to keep things under control. <br /> <br />The movie's main theme is being a family and how a family can go through hard times. But in the end, the family always manages to pull through and stick together. The word \\"Owahana\\" describes the meaning of family (the meaning I forgot, but I will post when I remember). <br /> <br />\\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is not like the past Disney movies. Though the movie itself may seem silly, it packs a darker tone that hasn't been in a Disney movie since \\"The Lion King.\\" An obnoxious little alien bent on destruction almost destroyed the most important value in everyone's lives: a family.  <br /> <br />\\"Lilo & Stitch\\" then became one of my favorite Disney movies (if not, my favorite Disney movie ever). The animation rarely uses computer animation (finally... a cartoon that actually looks like a cartoon). And each time I watched the movie afterward, it always felt as if I'm watching it for the first time again. Rarely doesa movie have such an impact on me. <br /> <br />A masterpiece.

B000002UA0|5.0|\\"Is this really Pink Floyd?\\" is the response you get 99% of the time when you present this album to a Pink Floyd listener who hasn't discovered this album yet. And, yes, I was one of those people. <br /> <br />I loved \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" I listened to it constantly from beginning to end (honestly, how can you skip a song?). One day, as I checked out Pink Floyd's discography on the All Music Guide site, they had two album picks: \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and another album I never knew about... \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" At the end of the review of that album, the critic called this album as being \\"one of the best psychedelic pop albums\\" with a perfect five stars out of five rating. My curiousity aroused, but still wasn't so sure about that album since Roger Waters wasn't the lead, but rather another person named Syd Barrett. <br /> <br />But my interest in the album would soon bloom when someone on the MTV site said that this album was \\"an essential\\" and Blender magazine calling \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" quote: The greatest psychedelic pop record that isn't \\"Sgt. Pepper's.\\" <br /> <br />So I decided to check out the album myself. I'm sorry to say that I didn't download it the \\"right\\" way. The entire album was downloaded as one big long track, but once completed I gave it a listen for the first time. \\"Astronomy Domine\\" was a haunting opener. Seemed to have the ingredients of later Floyd albums. So far, so good. Then \\"Lucifer Sam\\" comes on. My first thought was, \\"What the hell--?\\" Then later into the song, my second thought, \\"Is this really Pink Floyd?\\" Yeah... my first listen wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. But I didn't stop there. I kept listening. The sounds as each song progressed kinda reminded me of some Beatles work, just trippier and with lyrics that sound as if I'm listening to a children's story on acid. Witches, cats, kings, ducks, a mouse named Gerald, a scarecrow, some gnome named Grimble Crumble... oh my God, what am I listening to?? This isn't Pink Floyd! This is the Beatles on more drugs! [I'm telling it like it is.] <br /> <br />The funny thing was, after listening to my illegally downloaded album, I enjoyed it. I just had to listen again. Once over, I listened once more. There's no lyrics that have some sort of special message. There's no songs with complex rhythms or odd time signatures. There's nothing \\"deep\\" about this album. This is no \\"concept\\" album. This is purely a band that seemed to have fun making this album. You can just hear while listening to this album. <br /> <br />Syd's lyrics are purely enjoyable, creative, and humorous. Richard Wright's organ playing sounds like a happy and British version of Ray Manzarek (keyboardist of the band, the Doors). Roger's bass sounds something unlike anything I've heard from that era. Nick Mason is steady on the drums. Roger and Syd's singing is just absolutely brilliant. At times, they can be haunting, but melodic at the same time. The odd \\"outer space\\" effects add more to songs like \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"Astronomy Domine.\\" The band takes us on a journey to some place different. A place full of wonder and fantasy. Maybe the album can work as a concept album afterall. <br /> <br />I finally now know the little man known as Syd Barrett. This album was his true shining moment. Though he didn't write all the songs here (\\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" were created by all band members; \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" was written by Roger Waters), his lyrics were nonetheless more creative than any artist during his time. It's quite tragic that the piper had succumed to drugs and was kicked out of the band for being nuts. The remaining members (plus a new one) were able to succeed far more than they probably imagined. But they were able to pay tribute to their former frontman with their other excellent masterpiece \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" Later, the piper himself showed up to Abbey Road studios when the band were recording \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" were originally on this album back in the day, but aren't featured on this release. You'll find them on the \\"Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\\" release. If the two songs were added to this album, it would certainly add more to Syd's credits, as well as brighten up the album's themes. Two more brilliant songs to seek out. They were also big singles in the UK. <br /> <br />That being said, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is now my all-time favorite Pink Floyd album, as well as one of my all-time favorite albums. Playful, humorous, and creative makes this album an enjoyable listen. Though some of you may and will still favor Pink Floyd's later releases, this album cannot go unnoticed. At least a listen will do. This album is art. And to quote Blender magazine once again: The greatest psychedelic pop record that isn't \\"Sgt. Pepper's.\\" <br /> <br />But as you listen, think about this: How would the band have been if Syd Barrett hadn't left? Would they have made it big? Would there have been a \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"? That's what the album does: it makes us wonder.
B00004RJ74|5.0|i have to say this is one great movie, it had acion, horror, and comedy. seth and richard gecko are two outlaws on the run from the law, after blowing up a liqour store, they stop at a desicrated motel. there we find a family of three one father who used to be a preacher and his two kids. there the geckos capture them and steal there RV, forcing them to take them across the mexican border. when they enter the go to the randeavuos point, a seedy bar in the middle of the desert. there they are barricaded inside the bar buy the vampiers that own it. now teaming up with the hostegas and two bikers, its a kill or be killed battle against these vampires. see it it is a good move to wacth when your bored.
B0002MB7QW|2.0|That's the only way to enjoy this mess. Thw worst thing in this kind of disaster flick is that the producers try to give reasonable scientific background to explain all the absurds that happens in the film! That's annoying! Dennis Quaid's character would never get to New York.... And what abou that stupid \\"RACE AGAINST THE COLD\\"? Never saw something like that, it was so stupid that I must give credit to the producers. I laughed a lot.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This one is without doubt better than the three albums that followed Dookie-Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning. It is a natural progression from the experimenting seen in Warning, and it feels much more passionate than the boredom that seemed to taint the recording of Insomniac and Nimrod (not that Nimrod is a bad record-the band said themselves that they were feeling tired and had to take to take a break after recording and performing it, that's all). At it's best, American Idiot is very good-there's the throwaway catchiness of She's a Rebel, the melodic verses of Give Me Novocaine, the 9 minute opus Jesus of Suburbia, and the power-keg of absolute brilliance that is Letterbomb. Sometimes good songs are spoilt by mediocre choruses-Holiday and Give Me Novocaine have excellent verses and intros, but choruses that do not live up to the rest of the song. All in all it's three and a half star experience-above average and recommended.
B000002GQE|4.0|Where have all the concept albums gone? This sixties classic is as good as any of them, and it still holds a certain weird charm today. The idea of mixing songs by the Moody Blues (which follow a single day through its many phases) with orchestral interludes to link the whole thing together was a good one, and overall the thing flows pretty well. In addition to the famous \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin,\\" the other songs here are memorable and fun, mixing spaciness, joy, and sadness, often even within the same song. \\"Peak Hour\\" is a particularly strong rocker by John Lodge. Some of the lyrics on this album may come across as simplistic platitudes, and the spoken word poems at the beginning and end of the album ain't exactly Keats, but if we suspend our cynicism it's all a pleasant ride. Some of the orchestral interludes in the first half of the album go on too long and seem rather light and fluffy, but so be it, the songs make up for it. Enjoy this album and contemplate the almost-forgotten idea that an album can be much more than a collection of whiny dance tunes; indeed, it can strive for moving grandeur, a variety of sounds, and meaningful ideas. May more artists remember to strive in such a manner!
B00025ETIW|4.0|I can't remember where I heard of this band, but thank the oblivion that I did. This is an amazing CD from a so-called punk band, although I would classify this as closer to good old fashioned rawk. The lead singer's vocals are unique, and the riffs are worthy of air-guitaring, no matter where you are. The best song on this CD is \\"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison\\", which has one of the best openings of a song ever.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and didn't feel like I had to see it again on DVD.  But then I read an interview where Colin Firth said that the movie studio had to send him an advanced copy of the commentary to make sure he wouldn't sue -- because Hugh Grant made disparaging remarks about him throughout the commentary.   Sure enough, Hugh slags off his \\"rival\\" at every opportunity, snoring when Colin's scenes come on, calling him old and fat, and mocking his wardrobe.  But it's all done in fun -- and Hugh makes fun of himself as well.  Writer/director Richard Curtis, the little boy from the film, and the aging rock star also contribute great comments and much laughter (the other actors are seeing the film for the first time while doing the commentary).  Definitely one of the most informal and charming roundtable discussions I've ever heard on a commentary track.  The quite extensive deleted scenes are also worthwhile (each scene introduced by the writer/director).
0812550757|2.0|This story was most definately well written... But if you really enjoyed Ender's Game, you're far better off reading the \\"Ender's Shadow\\" spinoffs. Those were *awesome*. This book was enough to turn me off from all of the rest.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Those expecting Mark to have gone back to his old Dire Straits days will not find it here, however if you loved his music in the Golden Heart (probably the best album of the decade) you will be supremely pleased with this one.  <br /> <br />\\"All That Matters\\" is divine. \\"Whoop De Doo\\" is a ballad the likes of which were on Rod Stewart's \\"The Great American Songbook.\\". \\"Back to Tupelo\\" is the most \\"Dire Straits\\" song I've heard from him in years. You can definetely hear some \\"The Man's too Strong\\" in it.  <br /> <br />Overall I would highly recommend it.  <br />  <br />
B000002UB3|4.0|Very good album...They have better talent than any music band today!!! And they are still popular so you better get used to it.If it was not for them, we wouldn't have some of the good bands that are out today. <br /> <br />But Abbey Road is a good album, but my favorites are from 1964-1967
B00005JN4O|5.0|I was eager to see \\"Finding Neverland\\" but I knew that the film had a couple of high hurdles to overcome.  The first is that I loved last year's version of \\"Peter Pan\\" from director P.J. Hogan, who crafted what I think will be the best version of the beloved story for adults.  Certainly no other version of \\"Peter Pan\\" has touched upon the depths of the tale of the boy who never grew up.  The second is that I also have fond memories of the television movie \\"The Dreamer of Oz,\\" which told the story of L. Frank Baum (played by John Ritter) and how he crafted the characters and story of \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  \\"Finding Neverland\\" is in a similar vein, more comparable to \\"Dreamchild\\" (about \\"Alice in Wonderland\\") although it is more interested in the magic that was created on stage when the play first premiered than in detailing the specific sources of inspiration.<br /><br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" is about how J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) came to write one of the classic children's stories of all time (you start counting them on one hand and \\"Peter Pan\\" has to be there).  The situation as set up in the film is that Barrie's latest play has been a flop and his financier, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) needs another play to keep the theater and the cast afloat.  So Barrie heads off to the park with his journal and his dog to seek inspiration, which is revealed to him through a strategic hole in his newspaper and by the presence of a small boy imprisoned in a dungeon beneath his park bench.<br /><br />So it is that Barrie is introduced to the family of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow with four sons: George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Propsero), Michael (Luke Spill), and Peter (Freddie Highmore).  Slyvia and her children become not only a source of inspiration for the Lost Boys, Pirates, and Indians of Neverland but the family he never had.  But even in this reimagined version of how \\"Peter Pan\\" came to be written it is clear that Barrie does not want to be a father.  He wants to be a brother, and eventually we find out why that would be an important gap in his life to be filled.<br /><br />Mary Answell Barrie (Radha Mitchell) is not happy that her husband is seeking inspiration with another woman and her family, and Barrie seems to be on cusp of scandal as he continues to do what he want and writes his new play.  Mary is not a sympathetic figure because it is clear from the start that she has no idea what sort of man she is married to (we can debate exactly what that means, but whatever the interpretation the point is valid).  She thinks that her husband is cheating on her, and one of the ironies of the film is he does not do so, by either the conventional meaning of the term or the privileged meaning it has for her, until after his wife has beaten him to the punch.  Slyvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie) disapproves of the relationship between \\"Uncle Jimmy\\" and her grandchildren and what it means for the prospects of her daughter remarrying.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"Finding Neverland\\" is about the relationships Barrie had with Sylvia and Peter, more than it is about the creation of the play \\"Peter Pan.\\"  But it is when we get to the final act of this film, adapted by David Magee form Allan Knee's play, that director Marc Forster's movie becomes truly magical.  Barrie knows that he has created a work of genius, approaching this opening night with a supreme confidence he lacked for his work at the start of the film, having assured success by reserving 25 seats in the theater for his play's perfect audience.  But opening night is only the first half of the magic, and the second act brings together the major elements of the story into a sublime moment of beauty and wonder.<br /><br />I was disappointed that there was not more of Barrie's actual play, but then I realized that was because I erroneously thought that in the case of \\"Finding Neverland\\" the play is the thing.  What sets up the endings of this film is not theplay, but the relationships that have been built while we distracting look for the first signs of Captain Hook and Tinkerbelle.  This is a movie where the climax is everything you hoped it would be and redeems whatever shortcomings you see in the film up to that point, even if it is only in retrospect that you understand how it was set up.<br /><br />Depp's performance is incredibly understated by his standards, and I would imagine that an Oscar nomination and perhaps even winning the award could result from this film because of the immense respect and affection he has garnered in recent years with his stellar body of work.  But he is merely a conduit for something larger in this case, and if he is the recipient of the universal reservoir of good will engendered by a story that is about to celebrate its centennial, I have no problem with that.  Winslet continues to create a solid body of work without most people noticing, and while much will be made of Highmore's Peter it is Roud as George, the oldest son who if forced to be an adult in the span of thirty seconds by the circumstances of his life who captures my attention in a film celebrating the boy who never grew up and the man who wrote his story.<br /><br />WARNING: If you find yourself bespelled by \\"Finding Neverland\\" and want to find out how much of the story is true when you get online, all I can say in the strongest possible terms is DO NOT do that.  It will ruin your memories of this movie forever.  I am not even close to joking on this one and you have all been duly warned.been built while we distracting look for the first signs of Captain Hook and Tinkerbelle.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|The first thing that hit me about the CD was the cover, which is of a woman reaching up to the sky, which is tearing off her flesh. This CD tore the flesh off me with pure metal power.  <br /> <br />I didn't like it at first. It was too scream-y, too whiny, too long. Then I hit upon the 14 minute epic called \\"I Won't See You Tonight\\" and I fell in love. After this discovery, I listened to this CD about once a day for two months. This CD is a mainstay of my collection, never leaving my CD wallet. <br /> <br />Every song seems to have a catchy riff, an epic chorus and some amazing musicianship. Every time M. Shadows sings a line, I am listening. Who cares if they dress like goth kids or A.F.I. band members? Who cares if their love of late eighties hair metal influences their epics?  <br /> <br />All I know is that Chapter Four is the best song on the CD and has the best line on the whole CD: <br />\\"MURDER, LIAR, VENGEANCE, DECEIT\\"
1401301010|3.0|it is truly astonishing that anthony kiedis isnt dead. even if you arent a fan of the peppers (ive only ever liked their ballads and 'by the way' - the rest i think is just funk infused crap for nincompoops) - just reading about this crazed childhood and ridiculous fathering is entertainingly shocking in itself. he isnt the best writer, and you do sense he lays it on thick at times (he is determined to cram down our throats just how manly he is - detailing all of his scores - in case we had any doubts) - but the book is easy to read and a good insight into behind the scenes of the sex drugs rock n roll lifestyle - and more interestingly - a glimpse into the life of an LA junkie, womaniser/user, small time con, petty thief, bully, n'er do well. for every one anthony, there are ten thousand other unlucky b*stards who end up dead in the gutter - no hopers - this is the story of the one fluke who made it through - whatever happened to bob forest by the way? buy it (or steal it, as anthony would have done), and keep it in the bathroom as entertainment for one of those long, indulgent s***s
0553573411|3.0|This whole series would have been cut totally short if one critical thing had been done right from the beginning. Here on end it gets really annoying.
0393035158|4.0|We need prophets who aren't afraid to bust up decorous debates and warn us about real and present dangers.  In The End of Faith, Sam Harris sweeps aside moderate arguments about respecting the right of people to worship any god they choose and argues that the fundamentalist followers of monotheistic religions, if left unchecked, will destroy us all. Cruelty and madness grip Christians, Jews, and Muslims when they embrace injunctions to worship no other god but their own and smite anybody who does.  People whipped into frenzy by true faith become willing foot soldiers for crusades, inquisitions, intifadas, jihads, suicide bombings and ethnic cleansings.<br /><br />Harris tackles the sacred texts straight on.  He sees the Bible, Koran and Torah as primitive, tendentious documents.  Sandwiched between admonitions to be kind to your neighbor are numerous bloodthirsty admonitions to kill any neighbor who isn't of the true faith.  Unless we reframe the uncritical acceptance of these documents by their followers, he argues, we'll live in a state of perpetual war.<br /><br />His antidote is reason, and the same kind of empiricism that we apply to every other aspect of our lives.  If we won't get into a plane without some proof that it will carry us safely through the air, why don't we demand the same proof about some of the outlandish claims in the sacred texts?  Harris makes a distinction between faith, which he sees as the uncritical acceptance of dogma, and spirituality, which can be subjected, like science, to empirical attempts to discover what is not yet known.  He praises Buddhism for being a non dogmatic attempt to observe and express the deepest workings of the human psyche.  We think our path works, the Buddhists say, but don't take our word for it: try it out yourself.<br /><br />He also holds out hope that our increasing knowledge of neuroscience and biochemistry will enable us to better understand the mystical and ecstatic states we now ascribe to god.  Given more knowledge, the yearning to connect with the ineffable that drives so many people into the embrace of religious fanatics may find other, less destructive outlets.<br /><br />Like many prophets, Harris is stronger on the causes than the cures.  His discussions of Buddhism and neuroscience are more flybys than deeply examined solutions.  And he undercuts the strength of his argument by not giving enough weight to the numinous desires most humans feel.  Religion, not science, is where most of us turn to meet this need, and there are strong reasons for that.  So many of us are desperate for god.  Harris clearly isn't, and his lack of empathy for those who seek that connection is apparent.<br /><br />This is an important book, though, and a timely warning about the damage that occurs to civilization when the forces of unreason march under the banners of angry desert gods.iven more knowledge, the yearning to connect with the ineffable that drives so many people into the embrace of religious fanatics may find other, less destructive outlets.  <br /> <br />Like many prophets, Harris is stronger on the causes than the cures.

B00003CXIP|4.0|This movie was wonderful story. I was moved by this movie. And the relationship between friends are nice and interesting. Also, kids are good actors, especially River Fenix. He was a good actor. I like his acting. If you watch this movie, you'll think this movie is great.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is by far my favorite album of 2004 (got it just in time!).<br /><br />This CD is the perfect blend of everything that I loved about the \\"oldies\\" my parents forced me to listen to, and the newer singer/songwriters that I've fallen for.  It's classy, it's timeless.  I've yet to put this CD on and hear anyone complain.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up, this CD is a great gift idea (and good background music at parties!).  Just listen to the tracks here, you'll see what I mean.  I find myself bonding with my parents and grandparents more with each listen.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please vote for it!

The soft tenderness and the suggested poetry lay behind the  unavoidable duels.<br /><br />Once more the essential myth of the hero without any known origin and birthplace and no apparent reason to act in a conflict totally improper to him , the experience takes its place through the fight and finally the cycle has been made the hero vanishes without leaving no traces .<br /><br />A classic tale!
0802130208|5.0|Seldom does one find a character as grossly unhygienic and obese, yet highly alluring as Ignatius J. Reilly. He wears the same clothes day in and day out, feeds mainly on cake and Dr. Nut, and can hardly keep his job as a hot-dog vendor. Yet, he captivates readers' attentions as a vacuum sucks up dust. I believe the secret to John Kennedy Toole's success in A Confederacy of Dunces lies in his ability to meticulously embody Henri Bergson's comic theory in his characters. <br />According to Bergson, what one finds humorous is often linked with what one finds mechanical, rigid, and inelastic. In Ignatius J. Reilly, Toole naturally encompasses these characteristics. His inability to control his precarious valve, his eccentric, medieval way of thought, and his fear of Greyhound Scenicruisers turn Ignatius into a person unlike any other. In fact, these humorous traits make Ignatius seem less like a person and more like a machine that is incapable of adapting to changing environments. We as readers cannot help but burst out laughing at his foolish ideas (Crusade for Moorish Dignity), his obstinately bothersome body (\\"'Oh!' 'What are you doing? Are you fooling with that valve again? Nobody else got him a valve but you. I ain't got no valve.' 'Everyone has a valve!' Ignatius screamed. 'Mine is simply more developed. I am trying to open a passage which you have succeded in blocking. It may be permanently closed now for all I know.'\\" p. 60), and his foul hygiene (\\"Braah\\" pp. every other). <br />If not for the gloriously entertaining plot, Toole's skillful development of characters should be enough to pick up this book. You'll fall in love with the most disgusting man you've ever met.
0553579908|5.0|This book has some of the best writing I've ever seen. I really like it! If you want hardcore byzantine intrigue where any character can die, this is the book for you!
B0000CDL93|2.0|I really liked this film when I first saw it in theatres, even as I doubted a lot of methods in which Stone draws his conclusions and retells his \\"facts.\\"  The cast is good and, to be such a long film, it holds together.<br /><br />But in the years since then, a lot more has come out about the Kennedy assassination--and Stone's film.<br /><br />I just watched a show on the History Channel last night that completely destroys this movie's entire conspiracy theory.  It WAS possible for Oswald to get off three shots from 88 yards (and an 89-year-old man did it nearly a dozen times to demonstrate it); the fatal head shot DID come from behind the president (as shown in the autopsy); the \\"magic bullet\\" DID create the wounds in Kennedy and Governor Connally without turning or \\"hanging in the air\\" (a computer recreation showed how everyone was sitting for that to happen).<br /><br />Can these things still be argued?  I believe that anyone looking at all the data available now would have a hard time doing so.  But I know they will.  There's a paranoid guy at work who's passing out cheaply-made \\"documentaries\\" of what REALLY happened on 9-11, so crazy theories about everything will always be around.<br /><br />It was also disappointing to find out that Jim Garrison, the crusading attorney played Kevin Costner, was revised by Stone for his movie--and that Stone completely embellished his final speech in the film.  Garrison never said that!<br /><br />I don't really have much of a problem with that kind of artistic license, but only if it's acknowledged.  As long as Oliver Stone continues to insist that his version of JFK is reality, then it tends to make open-minded viewers a little squeamish.<br /><br />\\"Well, if that's not how it happened, then it should have!\\"<br /><br />That sounds more like something Michael Moore would say....
B0000027RL|5.0|I can't believe this album is back from '91!  I had listened to Pearl Jam all the time on the radio, but never got an interest on the band.  A couple of weeks ago, I got my hands on this cd.  WOW!  Is all I had to say.  What was I missing?  Everything I could ask for, this cd delivered.  The vocals, the guitars, the lyrics...this cd is awesome! <br />It's really hard to pick a best track, being all so good, but a few of my favorites are Why Go, Black, Jeremy, among others. <br />Pick up a copy if you want to listen to good music.

B00006RINF|4.0|4.5 stars.  This is my first Lacuna Coil purchase and I have to say that I am delighted thus far.  The music here is both epic in scope and ethereal in tone.  There is a very accessible feel to the album and it shows mostly in the polished production from start to finish; no track gets left behind.  The songwriting is deceptive, seeming to be less complicated than it really is.  There is a constant flow of creativity, with a heavenly lead female vocalist shimmering over the arrangements.  As for the contrasting lead male vocalist, I never found it either annoying nor off-puting in any way, with the overall effect adding to the grandiose feel of the album.  There are some influencial moments, like the track \\"Self Deception\\" which often sounds like an archival song from Paradise Lost's album \\"Draconian Times.\\"  My favorite track here is, without a doubt, \\"Angel's Punishment,\\" with its echoing vocal layers and ambient textures, spoken word lyrics mixed with powerful screams and gorgeous wails.  It has amazing depth, both musically and emotionally.  As for the rest of the album, there is not one weak track here, each one containing something to enthrall and coax the listener into a state of willful addiction.  Recommended.
B000669GAI|3.0|What kind of Pearl Jam fan doesn't already have these songs.  Way too hard to pick a PJ greatest hits as fans all have their own favorites.  I guess could be a good gift for someone who hasn't discovered this amazing band.  You're better off buying them a ticket to see them live instead, or at least one of their live albums.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is a great holiday film driven by an inspired and truly enthusiastic performance by Will Ferrell. Elf is also family friendly as it doesn't sink down to toilet humor (at least not often). I find it refreshing to see a comedy derive laughs by being witty or at least wacky instead of how many fart or sex jokes one can cram in a movie. The writers and directors stay committed to the character of Buddy the Elf and never lets the story drift away from Buddy's world. The movie also has strong and convincing performances from all the supporting actors which definitely adds an air of gravity to the over the top zealousness that Will Ferrell brings to the screen.  <br /> <br />I can say with confidence that Elf will be an annual holiday watch. It may not be as deep in message as some of the Christmas movie legends like A Christmas Carol but it contains that one attribute that all Christmas movie greats share, a true belief in the Christmas Spirit.  <br />

B00005JK8K|5.0|Just having arrived from some distant galaxy, I find myself one of the few people who thought WINDTALKERS was an excellent film.  It is far below the standards of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS, but I found the John Woo movie quite touching and involving.  Haven't we come to expect cliches in war movies?  What do you want? Soldiers who spout Shakespeare or have some deep philosophical beliefs?  Dwarves?  I found the cliches in WINDTALKERS the usual, but the actors bringing them to life did so with such finesse I found them interesting.  Sure, we've been there and seen them all before, but life is full of repetitious, tedious people.  The usual bigotry, honor, loyalty, fear, anger, frustration are evidenced in this movie.  Woo, most known for his non-stop over the top actioners, tries a different approach in this one, and while it may not be his best work, it's a different view of this talented director.  While Oscar winner Nicholas Cage is adequate in his role, the movie's best performances come from the supporting cast:  Adam Beach, Roger Willie, Brian van Holt, Noah Emmerich, Martin Henderson, and Mark Ruffalo are great in their roles.<br /><br />A little long, but wasn't the war long?  I find the tribute paid to the codetalkers an appropriate kudo to the Native Americans who fought so nobly in the war.  I liked this movie, but I must leave now for my distant galaxy.  Later...

This was the most original animation movie I have ever seen! Now I am excited to go and find more of Miyazaki's stuff. The characters were so unique, and such a well developed,  diverse range of personalities. The colorful scenery, original setting (a Japanese spirit bath house), and beautiful story was one to by loved by all ages. You have to see this!
0385513755|4.0|Just came back from the \\"Da Vinci Tour\\" in Paris and happy to say it was wonderful. We stayed at the Château de Villette just outside of Paris which was pretty much as described in the book. They served an excellent breakfast, croissants & soyfe e ([...] m) a delicious coffee substitute made from soy. Afterwards the days were spent time at the Louvre beginning at the Arc du Carrousel for a walking tour of the area around the Louvre.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the tour brought out the best in Chagall, and allowed us to appreciate characteristics of his work that we might have noticed before, but not had the occasion to fit them together into a complete story - and a special respect for the story certainly is what set Chagall apart from his contemporaries. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AAAAAA!!!!
B000009EAD|5.0|I have been an Iced Earth fan ever since I got The Dark Saga 2 years ago, and out of the 4 albums I have by them, this is my favorite one.  <br /> <br />After the Dark Saga, this album came out, and I think Iced Earth fans must have been very happy with this release. It truly packs a wallop, and it mixes very good meloncholy melodies, with thrashing guitar riffs. This is of course a concept album, just like most of their albums(I think all of them actually).  <br /> <br />1.Lyrics, the lyrcis are awesome on this, especially my favorite \\"life's a bitch, life's a whore...\\" I forget the rest, but anyway, the lyrics are awesome, haha. Anyway, if you enjoy heavy metal as much as I do, especially thrash metal, although im not the biggest fan of thrash, go out and buy this as soon as you can. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! This album is a must for Metallica and Slayer fans.
B00008CLOA|5.0|What is more to say, this IS the best album ever, and if you have the possibility to play SACD's there is no excuse not to buy this album.  <br />Sit back in your favourite chair , turn the sound up to upper pain limit and enjoy the masterpiece!
B00005JNDX|5.0|It felt like a comical amusement ride.  I couldn't stop smiling a long time after it was over.  It was good to see specific side characters get attention in this film, like Magda, Jed, Giles, the \\"Jellyfisher\\", and of course Bridget's 3 best friends.  I know that the love triangle with Mark and Daniel is rewritten, but I think it works well.  And I love the way Mark fights for her in the end, not only with Daniel, but how he gets her out of the T-land jail!  It was soooooo Mr. Darcy.  I just wish they had shown all the work Mark went through to obtain her release.  The way they showed Mr. Darcy hunting Mr. Wickham down and making him marry poor, stupid Lydia.
0385659792|5.0|Unreal story that boggles definition. Basically, a story of love and reunification with one's family. The rhythms and patterns of speech and thinking as written from the point of view of an autistic child leave you speechless. The writer is able to make you feel you know what it is to be autistic. Of course, those of us who aren't can never know, but it is a magical weird ride he takes us on.
B000066NW0|3.0|A lot of people think Avril isn't talented, that much is obvious. What else is clear is that a lot of people are incredibly jealous and feel the need to express that jealousy in really childish ways. What I find really funny is the amount of people who waste their time posting scathing and mean spirited reviews of her album. You don't even know this person and you slam her like she owes you money. More like she stole your Tonka truck and now you can't shovel dirt in the sandbox with the rest of the preschoolers. Don't you people have anything better to do with your time? Say for instance, Oh I don't know, maybe writing your own album? Oh wait, no record companies want to sign you. Sucks to be you. Nothing better to do than to completely make an _ss of yourself in public. Whatever, grow up and write your own stuff and quit hating others because they do what you can't.  <br /> <br />So, it's not the best album ever. It's fun and a lot better than the first, which I didn't buy. \\"Complicated\\" made my ears bleed. Still does. But, this album is a lot more promising than the first. \\"Nobody's Home\\" is the best song on the album, but each song rocks harder than anything she's done previously.  <br /> <br />Should you buy it? Probably not. Download it and buy Poe's \\"Haunted\\". Poe is incredibly talented, has an awesome voice, and deserves to have sick \\"Avril\\" money.
B00005NDEX|3.0|This album is a good production from Paul McCartney. I miss one of his genius hits, bat can not find any really bad songs either. <br />The best track is in my opinion \\"She's given up talking\\". It starts with an acoustic guitar that makes the basic element in the song, and then it build itself upp to a really good rocksong with a groovy sound. Another good track is \\"Your Way\\" which is a good ballad with a countrysound by using a nice steelguitar. <br />Through out, this is a good recording which earn 3 stars from me.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|After reading pitchfork's review of a 9.7 (!), I decided to pick up this disk and check it out. Normally I find that Pitchfork tends to like a little heavier music than I do so I was hesitant but went for it anyway. Real glad I did.<br /><br />I can't really describe The Arcade Fire's sound but to say it is completely their own. If I had to describe it, I would come up with some bizarre love child of David Bowie, David Byrne, and New Order. Can you hear it? Can you picture it?<br /><br />The CD starts off really strong with TUNNELS, a sleepy atmospheric tune that builds to an all out rock fest. They use an old upright piano with, it sounds like, the original strings on it and it is the perfect sound. It works. The CD takes a slight dip on the second and third track but gets back into the groove for POWER OUT and 7 KETTLES before it shoots to the moon on CROWN OF LOVE. Crown of Love.... wow... definitely one of the best songs I've heard all year. The rest of the CD more than holds its own with three more standout tracks: HAITI, REBELLION and IN THE BACKSEAT.<br /><br />Overall I am glad I took the chance and picked this up. With the exception of Stars - Set Yourself on Fire, this CD tops my list for 2004.

B00003CXIP|4.0|I like a story which was written by Stephen King, and \\"Stand By Me\\" is the favorite one. I like characters; Vern, Gordie, Chris, and Teddy. Thay are really cute, and they are a symbol or emblem of teen. So we can feel same as them, and we can feel same as ourselves. That's why this movie is loved by people from every country.

Only problem with him, actually its quite a big problem for me, is that I cant sing a long with the song because I feel like i'm ruining it:P
B000002VMH|5.0|Diva is an excellent, well-produced album from the wonderful Annie Lennox, and was released in April 1992. The cool ballads like Why (her signature song) , Cold, and The Gift show off Annie's distinctive voice. I really like the tune Stay By Me, which has a mesmerising, peaceful tune, and soulful verses. The terrific Walking On Broken Glass was a US hit in 1992 for Annie, and has an clever arrangement and a lovelorn lyric. Equally good is Little Bird , which has an arresting intro and exciting choruses. Precious is the other medium-tempo tune with dramatic choruses. An oddity is the closing tune Keep Young And Beautiful, which nostalgia buffs will recognise as being from the 1933 (!!) musical 42nd Street. Here it is a \\"faked vinyl\\" old-time soundbite. The other really good tune is Money Can't Buy It, which is a compelling tune about the price one pays for fame and shallow celebrity.  <br /> <br />I bought my copy in about 1993, and Diva again became my favourite album in December 2002 when I had it on high rotation on my home stereo while reading an Annie Lennox biography.  <br /> <br />This superior album is an \\"adult contemporary\\" style of high-quality pop and is still great to hear today. <br /> <br />5 stars
0142437611|4.0|This is a powerful page-turner which in my view should be read once through to fully experience its sweeping crescendo and then again at a more deliberate pace to appreciate the beatifully descriptive langauge and symbolism of the text.  Bellow writes with a detached sympathy for his unfortunate hero, Tommy Wilhelm, who finds himself on the brink of financial ruin and spiritual collapse.  I think this is an important story about alienation in our modern commercial society and renewal through acquaintance with the true bared self within us that we are taught to neglect and long to return to.  In just over a hundred pages, Saul Bellow manages to bring the ominously swelling pressures of his tragic hero's surroundings and inner monologue to a swirling climax, compassionately cleansing Tommy in an emotional acceptance of himself in the turbulent end.  All the while, Bellow meticulously develops a suffocating world in which with Tommy we can't help but feel the merciless chaos surrounding him and amidst it all sympathize with the poignant alienation of a reflective mind.  Very interesting read and highly recommended as a primer to Bellow's oeuvre.
0060977493|5.0|The thing I liked most about that book was the style how Arundhati Roy narrates the story and her special look at details. They wouldn't be mentioned in other texts. Further on I liked the metaphors the author uses a lot! How she's able to compare situations with other situations, so that in the end it's very clear what she would like to say. <br />Also the characters are very unusual: You know what they are thinking, the reader even hears the words of a song that they are humming. Or another example: you read the same thing that the twins do, when they read something backwards. Because of things like that you are as close as possible to the people and I can't remember a book I read where I was closer to the main characters. <br />On the other hand it's very interesting how Roy narrates a family story but at the same time there's the political story of India coming out in the background. <br />
6304286961|5.0|This movie changed my perspective of Rock n' Roll intensely.  This movie was so gratifying, it gave me chills, it also made me sort of understand Morrison more.  Val Kilmer portrayed  such a terrific roll as Morrison, I acually believed it was Morrison instead of the actor.  I love the doors.  I dont think the movie could be any better or any worse.  Thumbs up to Oliver STONE.  JIM MORRISON LIVES
0440214041|5.0|I first saw the movie for this book a few years ago while I was in Romania. After moving to the US I badly wanted to have a copy of the book and I'm very happy I did that. This book taught me many things ranging from life in Washington DC, to the structure of the CIA and FBI, and some underground facts about the political world as we know it. Does it worth spending7-8$ to broaden your horizons in this ever changing world? For me it did, and hopefully it will be the same for you.
B00064MW6A|3.0|I have always liked the character of Catwoman. From Julie Newmar to Michelle Pfiefer, I have always found the character cool. I didn't go into Catwoman expecting to see a good movie. <br />I had reservations about it not being the real Selina Kyle Catwoman and I had heard it was the Showgirls of superhero movies. But I was pleasantly surpsised. I enjoyed the movie and thought it was fun. Halle Berry and Sharon Stone put in some good performances and the movie was nice to look at. It was glossy and \\"pretty.\\"  <br />The story, however, was limp and too short. The whole skin cream idea should have been thorwn out in pre-production. The music was also pretty bad, except for the main title, which was cool. The special effects I though were pretty good, better than Spiderman and The Hulk by far.  <br />This movie is a good fun diversion for superhero fans. <br />Now, if you have always been a fan of the character of Catwoman there is a great documentary on the DVD. The Evolution of Catwoman chronicles all the catwoman incarnations over the years, her comic book origins, interviews with Michelle Pfiefer, Julie Newmar and others, with alot of original footage used. I reccomend you buying the disk for this documentary, especially if your a Catwoman fan.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The special effects were killer... but unfortunately, it was the only thing good about the movie.<br /><br />The first thing I said after the conclusion of the film was, \\"That could have been a lot better of a movie if it had a better cast.\\"  The acting, while not amateur, was not up to par.  I'm not so sure if it was just a horrendous storyline, or the actors failed to bring any spark to the screen. In any event, the only thing working for this movie was the terrific special effects.<br /><br />I didn't come away from the movie disappointed, but it could have been much, much better.
0802130208|3.0|Toole's Confederacy of Dunces is an amusing read with fascinating characters and witty dialogue. Although I did not find myself laughing as much as I expected, as I progressed further into the novel, I became entertained by my growing sense on disgust towards the main character, Ignatius. Ignatius J. Reilly is not the average bum that cannot succeed in life. In addition to being rude, fat inconsiderate man who lives off of his mother, his interests reside within the middle ages and criticizing everyone and everything around him. He is a pudgy bum with an opinion, and the bulk of the humor from the novel comes from his arguments with various people, or complaints about health problems with his valve. Ignatius' strange enjoyments such as masturbating to thoughts of his dog and extreme comments are hilarious. Ignatius replies to the policeman that complains about his lack of work, \\"Do you realize that he is trying to destroy our home?\\"     The central theme of the novel is that people congregate against those with different ideals. Toole begins his novel with a quote from Jonathan Swift, stating, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" Swift suggests that idiots outcast a true genius because his ideals are unusual. The novel is full of unique characters that get pushed away because of their differences. The genius is not necessarily a person who is more intelligent than the rest, he is the person that singled out because he thinks differently. Ignatius may not seem like a genius because his ideas are very random. Actually, he seems to be a large, unhygienic buffoon with insane ideas, but he definitely is strong-minded about his opinions. He is unique because his beliefs do not conform to the people that surround him and he is not afraid to voice them. If Ignatius' comedic dialogue does not grab you, the stories of these bizarre characters will keep you captivated.
B0001I55NS|5.0|This movie itself doesn't talk a whole lot about history as it is common knowledge in the world we live in that knights and castles, and ladies in distress existed a long time ago. What it does though it offers an exciting time with the family and something that you can show your kids (prefferably ages 13-18) and actually talk about it at the same time too. The movie does not rely on the book as much simply because some of the scenes in the book have been used and abused in current movies such as a Knight's Tale. If you wanna have some family fun on Friday night, while learning something new, or if you are a big fan of medieval movies buy this. If you are looking for a perfect screenplay that follows the book script to the letter you will be dissapointed.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I can't believe all the griping that is going on about this DVD set.  Its for the benefit of a good cause.  From Led Zeppelin and other artists and songs being omitted to the quality of the video.  What a bunch of whiny \\"consumers\\" we are.  How quickly we forget the spirit in which this event took place. <br /> <br />Buy one for yourself.  Buy copies for your friends and family.  Its only a little but its better than nothing.  Don't buy pirated copies and don't encourage others to seek out pirated copies.  Its shameful people are willing to sell pirated copies for personal gain. <br /> <br />I too watched this day long event glued to my TV set sharing this experience with the rest of the world.  There is so much to enjoy on this DVD set.  A true moment of grace when pop music put into action some of the idealism they put into their songs. <br /> <br />Thank you Bob Geldof.  Thanks to all the artists involved.  And thanks to all who made this happen.  I will treasure this DVD along with my old 45RPM copy of \\"Do They Know Its Christmas\\".
B0002XDODU|5.0|You can't fully appreciate Rammstein without making an effort to appreciate their songwriting ability, and this has never been truer than it is on their new album.<br />Especially songs like \\"Reise Reise\\" and \\"Morganstern,\\" though pleasurable to listen to if you're just into heavy metal music, cannot be taken at face value in order to be taken to heart.  Till Lindeman's operatic voice is at its best when the lyrics accompanying it are highly poetic, and that's exactly what we find here.  The title track sounds almost like an homage to Melville's \\"Moby Dick,\\" but I could be wrong.  And their Goethe tribute \\"Dalai Lama\\" is a fantastic modernization, though the title is kind of silly in my opinion.<br />At any rate, some people might not be able to appreciate this album, and it's fine if it's not your cup of tea.  I still hope nobody damns it as being a \\"sell-out\\" album, as it's got some of the most artistic depth that I've seen on any Rammstein album to date.  5 stars.
0802130208|3.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is a pretty funny book.  It never made me laugh out loud but i rarely luagh out loud from reading a book.  The main character Ignatius J. Reilly is outraegous and absurd.  His ridiculous actions make him the funniest character out of any book ive ever read.  Ignatius's character is what makes this book work.  The author did a great job developing Ignatius's character.  When you read this book you want to keep reading to find out what kind of crazy ridiculous things he is going to do next.  Ignatius just kind of wanders around in his own little world not really doing much of anything and he ends up in some pretty funny and ridiculous adventures.  Ignatius is a very grotesque and disguisting person so the humor in the book is also very grotesque and disguisting.  People who do not like grotesque humor may not find this book to be very funny but i enjoyed the type of humor and i thought this book was good.
0802130208|5.0|Confederacy of Dunces is the hilarious story of that gross abomination Ignatius J Reilly. Immediately his outrageous character will stand out and make a lasting impression on you (you probably have never encountered an Ignatiesque character before, this alone could be a good enough reason to give the book a try).  Hopefully you will gag, cackle and chuckle yourself to tears at Ignatius' intellectual ravings while the story waddles on, for it is really a matter of taste in humor that will decide whether you like this book or not. This story is not primarily plot driven; instead humor takes control and leads the turn of events on to a real gaggler of a finish. For some the slight lack of a strong plot will take away interest, but the beauty of the book is in the humor and character depth. Regardless of reviewers taste, all seem to agree it captures the New Orleans feel fully. Toole's style is offbeatly fresh and original. Clear and frank prose make the wry description of characters and their actions/conversations classic. It is such a shame Toole and his only sense of humor left this world underappreciated, for he could have produced more who knows how funny works. This is a unique and exceptional book that anyone with an open mind or love of humor will relish. Hat's off to you Toole.

0802130208|3.0|I can say this much, if you are a lover of the television show \\"The Simpsons\\", I recommend this book highly.  If you don't care for the show that much then don't bother.  One good thing I can say about this book is that it was a very easy read.  Due to Toole's simple language and diction the pages almost turned themselves.  Reading the novel didn't seem like much work at all.  However, the disgusting grotesque humor, the absurdity of the situations and the repulsive main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, make the novel drag.  I found Ignatius to be a lot like Homer Simpson in some ways.  At first he may be intriguing but then he just becomes annoying.  I found him frustrating because he has his masters degree and yet he has no real reliable job.  I felt his arrogance was overwhelming.  And although his mom still provides everything for him he remains a jerk to her.  The most uneccessary part of the book was the masturbation scene involving the dog.  It was quite possibly the most disturbing thing I have ever read.  Overall I thought the book was mediocre and boring, again, blah and meh.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Trully, I don't know what people saw on this movie... Besides the good actors - no surprise at this point, they really are great actors - it is only a promise... that never comes to the screen.
0802130208|5.0|This book was great. Toole is masterful in creating amazingly funny images. Very easy to read and made me laugh a lot at many of the situations the main character, Ignaitius faces. Definitely worth buying and reading...    Now to the long review, for all of you who have the patience to read something like this:     The genius of John Toole shines in his \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" a novel about a strange, poor middle-aged man removed from reality of the present. The novel uses several key strategies to make its reader laugh. Most important of all is the character of Ignatius, a young man and the main character of the book. Toole also uses tools like extreme exaggeration and stereotyping, and he relies on Bergson's idea of mechanical encrusted on the living as the means of comedy. Because of the use of these tools, the book moves and makes the reader laugh and sympathize with poor Ignatius, a slow, big hunk of a human.     On the first page of the book the reader runs into the main character's description, which, by the end of the book, becomes synonymous with the character's name, Ignatius. Just analyzing the description (or a part of it, not to spoil the fun and waste too much space) itself can bring great insight into the success of the novel.     A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs... Ignatius himself was dressed comfortably and sensibly... The voluminous tweed trousers were durable and permitted unusually free locomotion. ... (13)    The basic description of Ignatius keeps on in the similar manner. Toole shows the main character of the book, a rather large man in his middle thirties, to have a very disturbing appearance. His jacket is old and smelly and makes him look like a lumberjack. His hat adds to the overall hilariousness of the outfit and provides an extra object to make fun of. Ignatius himself is described as being of extreme proportions, and, when walking, all of his weight shakes with each and every fold of his presence. Toole creates a very powerful image of Ignatius, a large barely moving mountain. Amongst normal (not to Ignatius' perception, however) people, who would not have much trouble of walking or running, Ignatius is the king of taking breaks and lunch times, showing him restricted from certain human flexibility.   Henri Bergson, in his study of laughter, \\"Laughter: an Essay on the Meaning of the Comic,\\" proposes the following idea: in order for a comic to be funny, he should lack the adaptability of a human being. This has been known as \\"the mechanical encrusted on the living,\\" since robots and other mechanized devices can not adapt to their surroundings as much as humans can. To clarify this idea, here is a typical example of such behavior. Imagine a person walking on a street, and there is a banana peel laying on the ground. There are two possibilities: the person walks around the banana, or steps on it and falls. When would people on the street most likely laugh or chuckle? If the person walks around the banana, nothing happens. (A couple of gloomy faces walk away, perhaps) However, if the person steps on the banana and falls down, a loud roar appears. This situation is funny because any person should be able to miss the peel, but if they don't, they are less adaptive than viewers, and thus more mechanical.    Ignatius immediately jumps out as being more mechanical than people around him. Primarily, his physical shape makes him into such a comic: at one point of the book, he and his 80-year old mother run up the hill. Ignatius prompts his mother to stop running because he is afraid of his heart failing. This situation is already funny - Ignatius can not keep up with an 80 year old woman - and signifies another tool used by Toole to make his book work as a comedy, but more on that later. Since Ignatius can not keep on going, he is less flexible and that makes the reader both laugh at and sympathize with the mountain of a human being. Throughout the whole novel, Ignatius nags and whines about his life, or how he has broken something after bumping into something else. Ignatius also acts like a five year old, whenever he feels like, thus becoming less adaptive to his surroundings. Another reason for Ignatius to be a comic character is the way he dresses. His old, smelly, dirty, ragged clothes show externally his internal disbelief into modern society. And, of course, the reader must agree that Ignatius looks plain silly in his \\"practical\\" outfit.    Coming back to the example of Ignatius asking his mother to stop running, it can be seen that this particular situation is funny because a 30-year old man can not keep up with an 80-year old woman. Bergson calls this situation an inversion, where the roles of two objects or people are reversed. Normally, it would be expected for the mother to ask her child to stop running (at least of the ages the reader is presented with in the novel) and to take a break. However, Toole makes the situation funny by reversing Ignatius' and his mother's roles.    Another reason for the above-mentioned situation to be comic is Toole's masterful use of exaggeration. The easiest example to give is the Igantius' size. He is gigantic or even ginormous (if such a word actually existed). This alone creates a funny image in the reader's mind. In addition, there is also contrasting exaggeration, which can be defined as making something very important or big when it is not, and underemphasizing something important. A good example of this technique can be found in the scene, where Mr. Levy, the owner of the pants factory, hears the story about the small uprising of the workers. When he asks Ignatius of the event, the latter asks to fire the person who broke his flower pot and attempted to cut his name sign out of cardboard. When Mr. Levy asks the factory workers what happened, they tell him that Ignatius tried to make them attack the manager of the company. It can be seen that what is important to Ignatius is far from what is truly important. Toole uses this technique throughout the whole novel to contrast Igantius' beliefs and principles to the people around him or at least the general stereotype of normal people.    This brings on the last discussed technique used by Toole to make his reader laugh - stereotyping. In the \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" a couple of stereotypes play a major role: fat people like to eat, cops are stupid, Africans Americans work as cheap labor, just to name a few. Toole draws a parallel with the work of Woody Allen, who likes to use stereotypes in his movies and writing. (That can be seen rather easily in \\"Annie Hall.\\") The example of the first stereotype is easily seen from the text - Ignatius always eats something or thinks about lunch. The most vivid encounter with Ignatius' food habits is experienced by the lieutenant and the doughnut box after Ignatius went through it - few of left over from a dozen jelly doughnuts had all the jelly sucked out of them. The image of a large man sucking jelly out of doughnuts makes hair stand, but shows pretty well the stereotype of an oversized person: doing nothing else but eating food, watching TV, and laying down.    The next stereotype explored by Toole - the stupid police - is shown rather well by Lieutenant Mancuso, who tries to arrest Ignatius for no apparent reason (other than a funny looking hat). Mancuso is shown as an incompetent policeman since he can't catch any true criminals. The last stereotype is closely shown by Jones, the floor sweeper of a shady bar, and all of the workers of the pants factory. Toole plays on the stereotypes and creates dialogue closely resembling to the stereotypical conversations, thus creating amusing situations and making the reader laugh.    By using the techniques of extreme exaggeration, stereotyping, and mechanical encrusted on the living, Toole provides the driving force for his comic novel \\"Confederacy of Dunces.\\" Toole intertwines many of the above listed tools and uses them creatively to persuade the reader to laugh and sympathize with the poor, huge, out-of-this-world man named Ignatius.

In fact if they hadn't been at the last supper and sang the Apostle song you can barely pick out Judas's 11 companions from the mob. <br /> <br />Chaias, Pilate, and Herod sing in a difficult manner to follow; despite this Pilate manages one of the better performances of the show when he asks why Christ must die. Herod simply comes off annoying.  <br /> <br />Magdalene sings the nice 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' number and Christ's moment of doubt is very moving.

It's fun, stylish, has a handsome vamp, heros who keeps trying when the chips are down, and a heroine who has to decide who and what are important to her life.<br /><br />  Roddy McDowall plays aging actor Peter Vincent (Vincent Price allusion no doubt) who starred in countless horror films as a Vampire Slayer who now hosts Fright Night, a horror movie hour on the local network that could easily have been USA in the 80s or an local yokel station. All his films come to life for him in sickening reality when he is called upon by the teenager Charlie Brewster, an avid fan of the Fright Night show for help in dispatching the vampire next door.<br /><br /> The vampire next door, Jerry Dandridge is played with fun melodramatic flair by Chris Sarandon,(who was in that other memorable Holland film, Child's Play)  best remembered for his other evil role as Prince Humperdink in the Princess Bride. Dandridge also has a creepy and edgy sociopathic henchman who manages to be scary than him at times. There is an undercurrent of the serial-killer duo between them mixed with a metrosexual edge that leaves you wondering, if you're a chick, why does Dandridge pick beautiful women to kill if he loves and or appreciates them? Guess what?<br /><br />  This film does an uncliched legend blaster when it shows that the vampire is a disgusting and revolting. A vampire doesn't love you -- he needs you -- and thus another part of the vamp mystique is exposed to harsh sunlight.<br /><br />  His hideous transformation starts out with long feminine nails as he shape shifts into a ghastly blood-sucker with a mouth truly like a bat from hell.<br /><br /> Charlie puts two and two together when call-girls Dandridge orders show up decapitated on the news.<br /><br />  Of course, Charlie has problems without a vampire or his weird henchman living next door: His girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) has decided she's not ready to lose her virginity, right before Dandridge moves in. Charlie's mom is single. Soon, Charlie's mom invites vamp-o in to their home, and Charlie knows his days are numbered. It's a classic case of invasion, and too many changes for Charlie, psychologically. What I find most interesting is how Dandridge doesn't want to kill Charlie if only he'll keep his mouth shut. In fact, Dandridge shows odd compassion throughout the film, making his character more complex and vulnerable. This vulnerability shows through the most when he is with Amy. I don't really know any other vamps who've offered a chance to walk away, but once again it touches on a malevolent vein of serial killer fraternity. After all, Dandridge had let Charlie watch as he seduced one of the call girls up to the point he began to change.<br /><br /> At the same time, Amy begins re-thinking her choices because she thinks Charlie's acting strange since she wouldn't have sex with him. In an effort to win back his love, she pays Peter Vincent to fake a holy water test on Dandridge hoping this will get Charlie to leave Dandridge alone. Unfortunately, this is when Dandridge meets Amy. Amy is immediately drawn to Dandridge, more so then the usual victim, and we find out why. She is the likeness of someone he knew centuries ago.<br /><br />  In irony, she gives to Dandridge what she would not to Charlie . Then again, perhaps it is not so ironic. With the vampire she will have forever, but as she and Charlie are just teenagers there is no security with him. The scene of seduction between Dandridge and Amy shows that it is Amy's choice in the end.<br /><br />The first time I watched this film I was a pre-teen, and took it very seriously and now that I'm an adult it is sheer fun.t door: His girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) has decided she's not ready to lose her virginity, right before Dandridge moves in.

B00009W0U4|1.0|Irreversible tells the story of Alex, the victim of a brutal rape and beating in a Paris underpass, and Alex's lover Marcus and ex-lover/friend Pierre, [...] in search of \\"the tapeworm\\"; the pimp who assaulted her. The story is told in reverse, beginning with Pierre and Marcus being led from the club by police, and working back through the assault that set these events in motion and finally to Marcus and Alex earlier that day, unaware of what's about to transpire.     I'll start with the \\"marquee\\" scene in the film (the rape/assault), since this is what most people who rent or buy \\"Irreversible\\" are going to want to see. I can admit that images of rape can be very erotic on film, and I think that the amount of fantasy-rape porno online and on film pretty much proves that this is a turn-on for a fair number of men (and some women).     But this scene did nothing for me. There is virtually no nudity. It's brutal, but not particularly graphic. I didn't find it any more shocking than the rape in \\"Straw Dogs\\" (an infinitely better film) and it's less stomach-churning than similar scenes in \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" \\"The Accused,\\" \\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" and a lot of other movies.     The big problem is that the scene isn't designed to titillate (especially since it ends with a brutal beating that couldn't excite any viewer) OR deal with the subject of rape in an intelligent way. In fact, since the story is told backwards we first meet Alex a few moments before the assault, so you only sympathize with her character in the way you'd sympathize with anyone who's a victim of a horrible crime. The backwards style of the movie works against \\"Irreversible,\\" because the viewer doesn't get to know or identify with Alex at all until she's already beaten to a pulp.     At this point, I figured that we'd move back in time to get to know Alex, Marcus and Pierre; to identify with their characters and appreciate the horrible events (prior to the rape, we see Pierre beat the supposed assailant to death with a fire extinguisher in a scene that's IMO much harder to take that the rape). But that never really comes. We learn that Marcus likes to do coke and fool around with other women at parties while his girlfriend is nearby. We learn that Pierre is a wimp who likes to ask his ex-girlfriend sexually explicit questions about their former love life in front of her current boyfriend. We learn that Alex is hot, and that she's the type of girl who would date a jerk like Marcus. These are characters I'm supposed to care about?     Throughout it all we get a swirling, panoramic camera that only settles down like a voyeur to focus on images of rape, murder or gratuitous nudity. I'm sure the director used this technique to mimic the turning passage of time or something, but personally I found it more disorienting and unpleasant to watch than innovative. I'll give him points for running the end credits at the beginning of the movie, though; that was clever.     Overall, my biggest impression at the end of the movie is, \\"that's it?\\" Almost nothing happens. If you played \\"Irreversible\\" back-to-front, it would go like this: Alex sits in a park looking pretty. Alex and Marcus frollic naked and talk about things we don't care about. Alex, Marcus and Pierre talk about sex on a train. They go to a party. Alex is assaulted. Marcus and Pierre track the assailant down (I'm not sure if he actually was the assailant; neither do I care) and beat him to death. They're arrested. The end.     The director dresses the film up in swirling camera work and tells the story back-to-front to pawn it off as art-house fare that makes some point about the \\"irreversible\\" damage that some trauma (the rape and murder) inflicts on its characters. But ultimately, the movie is \\"about\\" watching a guy get beat to death by a fire extinguisher, and watching a hot girl get anally raped by a sleazeball. That's it.     I'm not going to get on my high horse and say this movie is \\"immoral\\" or \\"disgusting.\\" I've seen films like \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\" and \\"Salo: 100 Days of Sodom,\\" so this kind of subject matter doesn't turn me off. But \\"Irreversible\\" makes the unpardonable sin of being boring, and at least the aforementioned movies have the integrity to admit they're exploitation and then deliver the goods. Not only is \\"Irreversible\\" not shocking, but it also thinks you're stupid enough to think it's deep.     Don't waste your time.
0767834739|5.0|I Love This Movie! I'm a Resident Evil Game and Movie fan. This Movie is very very good. For only &50 million to made this movie but I think Alexander very well done on his first full dirction in this action,sci-fi film and he made everybody thought that this film is about $100 million for a capital! And the two hot girls in this movie are very very cool especially open up scene for Jill Valentine ( Sienna Guillory ) which is make my heart melt! lol ... also with Alice ( Milla Jovovich ) she's a very very cool smart actress! i really really love these two girls and have to say \\" I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! \\"...

Or are we only getting the \\"and then some?\\"  It is my understanding that \\"follow the white rabbit\\" and take the red pill is gone from the first film.<br /><br />What else will we lose?  Are we going to end up with the ultimate 10, plus the original five (including revisited and animatrix).  I'd like to see a two column comparison between the two \\"sets\\" to show that nothing, not a second of miraculous footage, was lost when it recieved the \\"ultimate\\" treatment.
B00005JN4O|5.0|This is the bittersweet story of J.M. Barrie's inspiration for his classic play \\"Peter Pan\\".  Casting for this movie is exceptional, and the performances by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are both profound and exceptionally human.  The young actors portraying the Llewelyn-Davies boys are extraodinarily fine young actors, and totally believable in their characterizations.  Julie Christie as Sylvia's mother, and Dustin Hoffman as J.M. Barrie's producer round out this excellent performance.  Poignant moment:  when J.M. Barrie inquires after Mr. Snow, and is told my Mrs. Snow that he has passed away.  Her comment to J.M. Barrie sums up how life should be lived.
B000001F3C|5.0|Before U2 hit world domination with `The Joshua Tree/ in 1987,they released a supercharged album back in 1983 in which I feel is their most direct and powerful album. `War is such an animal and it`s lyrics and melodies do not date 21 years later. <br />Evenjust by looking at the cover is a foreshadowing of the music to come. The boy on the cover has a look that radiates anger and defiance. And a great deal of the songs have those feelings. <br />Sunday Bloody Sunday adresses the troubles in Ireland with astrident miltary beat and lyrics.`New Years day depicts the apathy of the cynical by stating no matter how you try to change what`s going on,it stiil stays the same. `Two Hearts beat as One' is an exuberant love song without the soppiness that turns such tunes into messes of pure unadulterated sugary goo. `Drowning Man' is quite introspective. `The Refugee' is a track so tribal and primal,yet melodic, I doubt any band has ever come close to matching it`s melody or intensity. `Red Light' is an underrated highlight for me, complete with a blistering trumpet solo and some nifty work form backup singers. <br />The album closes beautifully with `40', a hymn calling for peace and a hopeful resolution. <br />Even if you dont care about the politics, the album is  musically acessible. None of the tracks are boring filler. Bono proudly called this album a slap in the face to complacent listeners and he`s right. There is angst for sure,but with clear concise vocals and melodies.  <br />This is U2`s best album in my opinion and while they have gone to make some great music, they have have never have been as aggressive and intense on this release.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Very good record, with a tracklisting order that packs a mean punch - undeniably classic Lamb of God, I'd have to agree that these guys are getting really good.  I was surprised when I first listened to it, I was stunned by the guitar work on this one - don't get me wrong, Lamb of God is my favorite band, I was just pointing out how much they have grown from New American Gospel to As the Palaces Burn to, now present day's, Ashes of the wake, anyone that is into REAL metal should definitely go out and buy this one, you wont be disappointed, trust me.  If you DO, which you SHOULD, go pick up a copy, I urge you to learn the lyrics and then go to a concert and scream them back, I'll have to tell you, if you like them on CD you should catch them live, I went to a concert back in October on the 23, of 2004...they were smokin'.  Another thing is that my best friend and I actually got to meet Randy, (the singer) he's such a laid back, cool dude who really appreciates his fans, which is another reason why I think they are as good as they are - it's a passion, a passion for making good music.
B0002TT0NW|1.0|This movie, I thought was done very unprofessionally.  The characeters, almost never wore the normal attire of the prior movies, robes, instead they opted more often for street clothes, and that, I feel, really took a lot from the movie.  Also, there was a lot of changing in the setting.  Hagrids cabin's location changed, along with the forbidden forest, the Quiddich field, and to wrap it up the Griffindor common room entrance.  Which brings up another unpleasantry, the Quiddich.  One would think that since this is a very important year for Quiddich, that there would be a lot of it.  But, there is only ONE game!!!! The rest you have to just figure out for you're self!  The lighting also influenced a lot of things, making even the happy parts gloomy and dismal, and also adding some confusion.  Another complaint of mine was that the plot was too hurried.  I felt that the only way that one could understand it, was to read the books.  And still, my brothers were wondering how everything worked, and they had read books 1 and 2!!!!!!  Some people might argue that there are just too many overlaping plots to show them all... but they're WRONG!  The plot context in the movie was too fast and could have included more stuff to make the movie better.  <br />Again, I am extremely dissipointed in this movie, and hope that the next movie will shadow the first and second, not the third.
0802130208|3.0|I thought A Confederacy of Dunces was ok.  Although I know many people that really enjoyed the book, I found it to be a little long and repetitive at times.  There are many funny parts to the book; I found myself laughing (most of the time in my head, but laughing nonetheless) every now and then, even though a lot of the humor is crude and gross.  Ignatius is an interesting and unique character, and I feel Toole did a good job of character development.  Every character in the book has their own personality, and they are deep enough as to where the reader feels like they really know them.  Along with the comedy in the book, however, Toole slips in a lot of social commentary.   <br />If you're looking for a funny read, A Confederacy would be a pretty good choice.  It wasn't the best book I've read, but it certainly was not the worst.
0802130208|5.0|Whether you end up loving or hating this novel, one thing for sure is that you will be left with the memory of a character you will never forget. John Kennedy Toole creates one of the most massive, childish, grotesque, and filthy characters in all of literature. I myself had a smile on my face throughout the book, laughing at almost every line to come out of Ignatius Reilly's mouth. If anyone has ever watched Mad TV, picture a somewhat intelligent form of Stewart and you have Ignatius. Ignatius is a character we love to hate, find bizarre and absurd, but also feel a bit sorry for at times. While himself a disgusting creature in the eyes of the New Orleans community, Ignatius feels that it is not he, but the rest of society who is out of place. The way Ignatius puts his outrageous thoughts to words is hilarious, both in the  meaning of his lines and the way in which he talks. From the opening paragraph any reader will see that this work is particularly strange. You never really can guess what Ignatius is going to do next. Whether it is frightening children at a movie theater or staging a murderous revolt at a clothing factory, Ignatius is completely unpredictable and I think this is why so many readers are attracted to him. This is a quick read, not a lot of plot or suspense, but quite funny and enjoyable to sit down to. If anything, read it to meet Ignatius.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I was very leery when I heard that Rammstein was coming out with a new album. Mutter was insane in its riffs and lyrics. I had it in my car stereo for almost 5 months straight. When I heard \\"Mein Teil\\" on the Resident Evil Soundtrack I was thinking Rammstein isn't as forceful as on Mutter. I was a fool. I bought Reise Reise and was truly amazed in how they took a more slender approach at this album. The opening track Reise Reise is truly addicting, I have it repeating over and over in my head. Mein Teil is next, very good under my questioning of its validity to their style. Dalai Lama truly great distinct lyrics, one of my favorites. Keine Lust faster than the others very sound in its rhythm. Los is very acoustic based very well planed out. Amerika truly satirical and addicting, when it first came out I couldn't stop singing it and I got my friends singing it as well. Moskau very enthralling the girls Russian lyrics in the back along with Till's deep German voice intertwine perfectly. It makes you want to start counting in Russian. Morgenstern, my favorite track. Power in its lyrics so distinct. Stein Um Stein a very dark song probably my second favorite, Till screams the refrain at the top of his lungs, very captivating in his voice. Ohne Dich, very much a ballad soft yet catchy. And lastly Amour. Amour is wickedly good, when I first heard it on my way back from the record store I thought my rear view mirror would fall off. My subwoofer was pounding, the bass on the chorus so rapid and trembling, sinfully good. I was very impressed by this album. It taught me not to doubt Rammstein because they always seem to come through, even when I wasn't expecting an album as subtle as this it still impresses me to the upmost degree, truly worth every penny. Rammstein Truly Is The Evolution Of Industrial Rock And Metal!!!

B000066NW0|1.0|Sorry any Avril enthusiasts, but you wouldn't want me to lie to you, would you? And stop saying my review isn't helpful, because you most likely already own this album, considering it was one of the top-selling albums of 2003, and this review is for people who haven't bought it yet, so shut up already and stop complaining, just because you can't handle the truth that you actually fell victim and wasted 14 bucks if not more out of your wallet to hear this s***, dose not entitle you to say my review was not helpful.     1. Avril Lavigne is a poser in every form of the word.    2. Avril Lavigne cannot sing.    3. Avril Lavigne does not write her own songs, she co-writes them with a team of professional song writers called The Matrix.    4. Avril Lavigne thinks her life is so miserable and worth complaining about when it's not.    5. Avril Lavigne cannot play guitar.    6. Avril Lavigne has no relation to the word &#34;punk&#34;.    7. Avril Lavigne is not the anti-Britney Spears, she's the      Canadian version of her with a different image used for marketing purposes. All the &#34;I'm badass&#34; attitude she tries to pull off throws the average consumer into focusing on her image rather than her musical contributions, thus leading them into thinking that she's &#34;real&#34; and maybe even (gasp!) &#34;punk&#34;.    8. Avril Lavigne's lyrics are so stupid and thoughtless that they sound like they're written by a third-grader who thinks they can write a decent song just because they can rhyme words together.    9. Avril Lavigne does not know what real anger or pain is, and therefore should not attempt to write about it.    10. Avril Lavigne and her &#34;music&#34; SUCKS plain and simple.    Are you planning on purchasing this CD after reading this review? Most likely, because you're extremely unintelligent, and actually think Avril Lavigne is a punk, writes good songs, and even (if my eyes don't decieve what I have read in previous reviews) a genius..yes I said GENIUS. WTF is up with you people??? C'mon now GENIUS?! &#60;ugh&#62; you disgust me.
0802130208|4.0|\\"When he had finished the first hot dog, Ignatius prepared and consumed another, contemplationg other kindnesses that might postpone his having to go to work again.\\" <br />      Anyone who has ever been a cynic, procrastinator, college student,or waste of life can appreciate the lazy mess that Toole illistrates through dysfunctional Ignatius J. Reilly.  This thirty year old bum reminds me of the ever-present \\"that guy,\\" the one who go to great lengths to ensure their own laziness or alternative lifestyle.  Whether he is faking injury, going to movies he knows he will hate, preaching medival christian values, telling horror stories about Scenicruiser buses, or explaining his mysterious \\"valve,\\" Ignatius endlessly finds new ways to avoid conforming or producing.  Toole may go to extremes to make Ignatius's adventures more humorous, but I still enjoyed Ignatius's lifestyle because he is an exaggeration of the kind of dysfunction we see everyday.  His suto-intellectual, self-rightous feelings of superiorty work as an absurd parody to so many irrational actions that people back up with idealogy and theology (but never geometry...). <br />       Another reason to enjoy and relate to Toole's rediculous scenarios is that the story is a product of dysfunctional people directing other dysfunctional people.  I believe all the characters could be members of the confederacy of dunces, because not only are their actions absurd, but they usually attempt or succeed in influencing others.   Myrna Minkoff, Ignatius's nympho/rebel/\\"free thinking\\" college pal clearly has a few screws loose on her own and shouldn't be giving advice to anyone, let alone a 30 year old who mastrubates to dogs.  But, Myrna's crazy beliefs actually get to Ignatius and spark his intrest in another crazy idea, The Crusade for Moorish Dignity.  This pattern of dysfunction feeding dysfuction repeats itself in many of the stories relationships (Ms. Levy and Ms. Trixie, Ignatius and Mrs. Reilly, Manusco and Mrs. Reilly etc.)  One might say that the stories characters don't appear to be so far off from the back and forth absurdity of politics, relationship battles, or overly-analytical English classes. <br />    So critical of the world around him, and equally so unaware of himself, Toole's anti hero reminds us why our friends have a responsibility to laugh at our complaints and say \\"shut up and do your work.\\"
B000089RVX|4.0|I like it. Amy Lee's vocals are beautiful, haunting, and eerie. The lyrics (although I never judge songs by them) were interesting, stood out, and most were actually worth paying attention to. The band's driven industrial metal sound may not be as creepy as some other doom-metal stuff, but that stuff is not as listenable, and dare I say it, mainstream, as this.   Evanescence is a good band and this is a good CD regardless of expectations to be \\"goth\\" or anything relating to that genre, and we don't need an essay on what the term \\"goth\\" means, all you people out there who claim to know the definition to a tee. So stop with the bad reviews already, Evanescence is NOT, I repeat NOT just Linkin Park with a chick singer.
B000286S8S|1.0|I don't know the David Lee Roth vs. Sammy Hagar controversy very well, and I've picked up on the songs from Van Halen/Van Hagar over the years from the rock stations and MTV.  But even I've heard \\"Eruption/You've Really Got Me Now\\" in that order, which just tears up the speakers!  Got me first interested in VH, and I'm outside of the battleground to appreciate what both Roth and Hagar brought to the table.  They are Van Halen and Van Hagar respectively, with such different sounds, and I like both eras. <br /> <br />But, when I saw that the compilation interrupted \\"Eruption\\" with the 3 new tracks (don't really care for them either) instead of segueing into \\"You Really Got Me Now,\\" that irritated the bejeezus out of me.  When I went back to Amazon.com and saw a completely different track listing for both discs, why, that just turned me as red as the cover.  Put the latest 3 tracks at the end of Disc 2; throw out the live tracks since they're redundant!  And the Amazon.com listing looks like the DLR-Disc 1 and SH-Disc 2 format that other reviewers have suggested.  I would've appreciated that instead. <br /> <br />And finally . . . the brothers Van Halen couldn't even put a picture of Roth in the compilation?  They couldn't put one Cherone-sung song in?  This is very petty, and also not representative of the \\"worlds\\" these discs claim to portray.  Sad.  What, did DLR do their sisters, steal their girlfriends, kick their dogs and stiff 'em with the bill? <br /> <br />Minus 1 star for the misleading track listing and \\"Eruption\\" interruption.  Minus 1 star for the uncrediting of Roth and for leaving Cherone in the cold.  Minus 1 star for the new tracks and live track redundancy.  Minus 1 star for general irritability at feeling ripped off.   <br /> <br />Eddie, you're still a guitar god, but please leave your differences at the customer's door.
0802130208|3.0|Being thrown into the world of Ignatius J. Reilly was an interesting experience. The introduction of such a bizarre character certainly caught my attention and kept my interest for the first quarter of the book. Ignatius is revolting to the point where there were times I had to put the book down simply because I was cringing too much. That said, I am not a large fan of disgusting humor and reading about his bodily function issues did not appeal to me.     This novel is driven, as most comedies of this sort are, by the way in which things happen rather then by a strong plot. Toole's writing is easy enough in its clarity, but I still found myself rereading sections to better understand what had just happened. Not that you have to go back in order to understand, but it was more like I reread it just to make sure I picked up on everything. The scenes are so absurd and the experiences and mishaps of the characters are so crazy, that there is no possible way to process it all the first time through.     But the fact remains that this book did indeed make me, someone who does not usually enjoy disgusting humor, laugh at times. Ignatius' outlook on the world and his writings about it, his conversations with others and the situations he gets himself into are ridiculous, but they are what compel you to read on. I do recommend this book for anyone looking for a good comedy, that is, only if your stomach is strong enough for this sort of humor.
6304535570|5.0|I really love this movie. It is one of my favorites. I watch it every now and then. I like the chemistry between them. I like the romantic scenes a lot also. I think its a very romantic and exciting film. The photographic scenes of russia and london are amazing.

0802130208|4.0|If you're looking for an easy read that will make you chuckle, A Confederacy of Dunces is the answer to your quest.  The story of Ignatius J. Reilly takes place in the colorful city of New Orleans.  Along with this, John Kennedy Toole creates a number of corresponding lively characters, from policemen, to mothers, to friends, to employers.  The story follows Ignatius through his various attempts to find a job and live his life as much in the manner of a sloth as possible.  Physically, Ignatius is enormous, which provides laughs due to the various comments and situations his size encourages. <br />Personally, I don't laugh out loud when I read books, but Toole's tale of the overbearing Ignatius J. Reilly definitely had me smiling and giggling at points throughout the story.  Toole has a wonderful ability to develop his entertaining and rich characters in a direct writing style that allows the reader to enjoy the book rather than be bogged down by complicated descriptions and scenarios.  The most complicated parts of the book are the writings of Ignatius about his feelings and observations of society, and at this point, the reader is laughing at the lost intellectual and his self inflated view of the world. <br />  Don't pick up A Confederacy of Dunces if you're looking for an intellectually stimulating story.    This is more of the kind of book that is good for a vacation or a light read before bed at night.  Or maybe, it would even be a nice addition to a curriculum needing a more modern book regarding comedy that is skillfully composed. <br /> In general, A Confederacy of Dunces is a great read for the light of mind and heart.  It is too bad that the creative genius of the author could not be more enjoyed due to his untimely death.  For surly, once you finish A Confederacy of Dunces, you will wish that you could see what path Ignatius will continue to plow for himself in the future. <br />
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is the story of a grotesque, anti-social, obese man who lives in New Orleans. He's hilarious, a homer simpson-esque character. He's repulsive, irresponsible, and dellusional, a lot like the widely adored dunce in the Simpsons.   <br />  The strongest point of this novel is the character development. Toole portrays his characters in so much detail, depicting every nuance of characters like Ignatius, Mancuso, and Jones. Toole depicts all the characters thinking or doing absurd things. It's a story of caricatures.  <br />  Fans of the great authority on laughter and comedy, Henri Bergson, will easily see why this novel is praised as a brilliant work of comedy. whether he likes this book or not, he can see that it's full of classic comedic tools proven to work. Caricatures, characters with really really exaggerated traits that seem almost mechanical, are funny according to Mr. Bergson. This element of humor is clearly present throughout the book. There are a couple of characters that can't control their bodily functions. There's plenty of subversion of authority throughout, a tool used a lot by the Marx Brothers and touched upon by Bergson. There's LOTS and LOTS of repetition.  <br />   Personally, I didn't laugh that much while reading the book. Repitition is a good tool for laughter but only when used sparingly. The plot's too predictable. Some might say the plot is negligible since the main attraction of the novel is the comedy. But for me, comedy and plot go hand in hand. For example, the story Watt by Beckett is supposed to be a work of comedic genius despite being plotless. Through repitition and insane combinations and permutations of words, it's supposed to crack up the audience. Didn't really hit me on a gut level unfortunately.  <br />   Anyways, i only recommend this book to reader's who can appreciate the process of analyzing award winning novels objectively to understand their greatness. Objective score: 5. Subjective score: 3. Average score: 4 stars.
B00069YDXU|5.0|****Pay no attention to the review w/ONE star.. Whoever wrote that needs a new telescope!*** I own all the DVD's by this group. The production on this is AWESOME. It would have been nice to have an overhead cam on Keith Emerson..(only a minor quibble) but... there is PLENTY of great technical shots, so do not worry!! This is killer picture and sound! Great \\"patience\\" by the director too, as I cannot stand directors who jump too quickly with camera angles. Great job! Most of the new Montreaux releases are getting the same great reviews..See the Gary Moore Montreaux reviews for example, as they too rave of the quality. I paid only $9.00 for this at Tower. Just a fantastic show...Keith even hits a really bad note on the solo for \\"From the beginning\\" which makes him seem almost human?(Yeah right)..Actually no, ...he is not human... he is incredible! The \\"one star reviewer\\" claims his \\"timing is off throughout the entire show???? Yeah ok, that's believable...NOT. (Mr one star needs a gyroscope to go with the new telescope)I don't think Keith has slowed one bit. It isn't 1972 anymore and most artist get better with age and Keith and Carl are no exceptions. Keith is better on the Piano segments then back then.(Lake has slowed, and his voice has dropped, but most fans know that)..Buy this one! It blows away that Royal Albert Hall DVD (AND THE OTHER ONES TOO)
B00005JMXX|2.0|What a waste of a great premise. There hasn't been a really good disaster film in a while that focuses on what happens after, and this one is sure no exception.  The premise is great - sudden climatological change causes a new ice age in a matter of days over the entire northern hemisphere.  Great special effects of the storms (especially the destruction of LA), but then, poof, it's over. The last 40 minutes is about a silly attempt by Dennis Quaid to find his son trapped in a frozen NYC.  No suspense, bad acting, bad dialogue, totally unbelievable, boring and predictable.<br /><br />What a movie this could have been.  Will mankind survive the new ice age?  How will civilization reorganize? How will the different main characters that could have been set up (but weren't) manage?  How does it all tie together?  None of this was realized, nor most likely, was even considered by the writers, producers and directors, as it was in, say, Independence Day which was pretty good.<br /><br />Forget this movie and read Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle instead, if you want to see what the days after might really be like.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I have read 19 of the 20 Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian and my wife is now on her sixth and counting, and we obviously love them.  Now comes this film adaptation largely based on numbers 10 and 1 (mostly on number 10), and it is close to perfect.  Russel Crowe is Aubrey exactly as I imagined him and Paul Bettany, although handsomer than O'Brian's description of Stephen, is thoroughly convincing because he communicates the essence of the character with scrupulous accuracy.  The ship and life aboard her are not only well presented but presented with more authentic detail than ever before seen onscreen.  I speak as one who thoroughly enjoyed Errol Flynn's Sea Hawk, Douglas Fairbanks's (the elder) Black Pirate, Gregory Peck's Captain Horatio Hornblower, etc.  By the way, I read all the Hornblower books, Rafael Sabatini's Sea Hawk, etc., and, though I never dreamed I would say such a thing, the Aubrey-Maturin novels are better than any of them.  In sum and as a lifelong movie fan (of both silents and \\"talkies\\") I'd rate Master and Commander as one of the finest films ever made.
B000669GAI|5.0|This is a collection of the largest hits of one of the greatest American rock bands of all time.  Apparently the other reviewer forgot about the Lost Dogs, CD since that was what he was apparently wanting to be released - again. <br /> <br />This is a celebration of their most successful singles, hence the name 'greatest hits' not the name 'best songs you never heard' by Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />It's a fantastic collection and the new remixes are any fans delightful addition to their collection.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Although I haven't gotten all the way through the 4 CDs yet (I'm currently starting on Disc #4), I'm just blown away! These songs (most previously unreleased,B-sides,import \\"extras\\",  some soundtrack songs, and a great interview DVD) is quite a treat to this die-hard fan of 18 of their 20 years as a band and maker of great music. The lyrics are incredible and the arrangements rockin. You won't want to stop listening! It's like getting 4 new Bon Jovi albums all at once! Love it! Love it! Love it! Give it a listen - if you're already a fan, you'll rediscover why, and if you're kinda iffy, this may just sway you to being one of the 100,000,000 who already know the magic that is Bon Jovi.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Ok, I wanted to respond to a reviewer who said that the only people who buy Britney's albums are guys who think she's hot.  That is completely wrong.  Britney constantly taking off her clothes may have gotten her attention from men, but the VAST majority of consumers who bought her cd's were GIRLS!!!! Think about it, how many straight guys do you know with a Britney Spears CD???  NADA. BUT, look through a guys' cd case and here are some of the women you may see....Ella Fitzgerald, Garbage, Tracy Chapman, Norah Jones, Alicia, Alison Kraus, etc. These are just some of the cds I have found when looking through the cd cases of my boyfriend and guy friends. This shows that while a \\"hot body\\" and good looks(although Britney sure hasn't been looking too hot walking out of public restrooms with bare feet and much needed acne medication, just shows what makeup and hours of airbrushing can do!) might get shallow, short-lived attention from guys, it sure as hell ain't going to get you respect or a career from them.  No, the ones who have been fueling this trashy, talentless career have been girls, and it needs to stop.  By dressing in sluttly clothes and partaking in obnoxious, hypocritical behavior-the tacky, overhyped Madonna Kiss, the 24 hour marriage and divorce, the man-stealing, buying own engagement ring, posing practically nude for countless mags, the \\"I'm a virgin, oh wait, oops, I'm not!\\" Britney has betrayed and isolated her fan base, young girls.  Look, I don't have a problem with Cortney Love acting trashy, she never set up herself as being innocent and her fan base hasn't been young girls.  But Britney has deceived millions....she presented herself as this virgin/whore who teased but was always a \\"good girl,\\" and once she made her money, she abandoned her fans and became the slut that she is.   <br />So I am begging the women out there who are fueling her career....PLEASE PLEASE STOP!!!!!!!!! There are so many reviews out there that are like, \\"I don't like Britney, she's a bad person, but buy this cd!\\" First of all, most of these songs are on her other cds, except for three that aren't that good. Secondly, people have to take a moral stand every once in a while, and realize that Britney Spears has been TERRIBLE for women AND the music industry.  To say that she is a \\"great\\" performer is an exaggeration.  One of my friends is a professional dancer, and she told me that Britney's not even that great a dancer, that she uses really simple moves that she puts a lot of \\"effort\\" into so that they look really complicated. If you want to see a great pop performer by a talented female singer, buy Madonna's \\"Truth or Dare.\\" But bail out on Britney, download her songs if you must, but PLEASE DON'T buy this CD.  It's time to put an end to this immoral, brainless bimbo.
0802130208|3.0|Having just finished the book a mere 5 minutes ago, I have not fully collected my thoughts. My initial reaction at the conclusion of this novel was that the book was okay. It had humorous moments, but nothing that immediately stands out. The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is quite the character. He's disgusting, disrespectful, and downright irritating at times. He provided almost all of the entertainment through his \\"the world is out to get me\\" attitude (which is probably one of the reasons for the title that Toole chose). If someone touches him, Reilly immediately claims to have been assulted and promptly tells that person that he better have an attorney on hand because he was about to get sued. On the surface, it's Reilly's personality as well as his appearance that causes the reader to harbor dislike towards him. Unfortunately, this can overshadow the humor that comes from those very characteristics. I know that I was turned off by Reilly's whole presence, which at times, made this novel unreadable because I honestly thought I was going to get sick from the way that Toole portrays him. Once I got past that initial reaction, I learned to deal with Reilly and the novel became a lot more entertaining and amusing.  Overall, I do recommend this novel because it is completely unlike anything else that I have ever read. Ignatius' behavior is outrageous and unpredictable. His speech is very eloquent and formal, which provides the most amusement because most of the ideas he spews forth are insane. His interactions with other characters, such as his mother or his ex-girlfriend, are unreal. I would never want to be treated the way that Ignatius treats people but I find it strangely tolerable in this novel where nothing seems to agree with society's standards of decency.
B000001GPW|5.0|I cannot say what are the definitive versions of Bartok's piano concertos, but this is an amazing set. The orchestra and soloist are exceptional, never afraid to be as light or heavy as the music demands, with an intuitive sensitivity to the score's demands.<br /><br />Piano Concerto no.2 is my favorite. With his second concerto, Bartok wanted to make it \\"lighter\\" and more pleasant to the audience. However, he also desired to remain in the same sphere of compositional style as the first. Thus, he makes no compromises with popular taste, sacrificing nothing in the way of vision or complexity. Although technically similar in many respects, they are different in important ways. Compared to the first's impulsive, prickly development of ideas, the second asserts itself more meticulously, like Bartok's middle string quartets. The first movement is starkly arranged (winds, percussion, piano) but melodically delightful and rhythmically varied. Pianist G&eacute;za Anda's approach on the second concerto is in perfect command of the technical elements and also abstracts like the playfulness and eagerness. The deft but sweet conveyance of the second movement's critical presto is remarkable, and the return to adagio in the final section unleashes colossi of dissonant chords over rumbling percussion takes one's breath away. The final movement is best of all: deriving most of its material from the first movement, it is viciously dissonant and rhythmically aggressive. It is also a throwback to the Baroque period with its emphasis on contrapuntal technical and concise thematic development.<br /><br />The first concerto also factored into this development of merging folksongs with baroque tradition. But despite Bartok's obvious commitment as an ethnomusicologist for Eastern Europe, \\"folk songs\\" for Bartok were did not only mean popular songs of the Carpathian Basin, but also other ancient musical traditions like African drum music. This is an important influence on the composition core of the first piano concerto. The rhythmical proto-idea appears at first on piano and brass (low-registers) and from here numerous thematic evolutions unfold. Long considered the most expressive of all instruments, Bartok shapes the music from the percussive qualities of the piano. The percussive aspects of the piano were often important to him. Percussion rises to a key role in this piece, as in the early part of the second movement, a tense exchange between percussions and piano. Then, an exhilarating piano ostinato in 3/8 for many bars, spliced and developed multitexturally and with melodic variation. These are powerful Bartok moments.<br /><br />The third concerto is less dissonant, \\"brighter\\", and more \\"classical\\" than the other two. Yet Bartok's spritely melodies are captivating and the piano parts especially imaginative. The second movement is very powerful, with a slow and sparse texture but it develops into a complex formation of musical pinpricks and fragmentary melodies. It is less compelling than the other two, but it reflects a profound, deep atmosphere of uneasy peace.re of the first piano concerto.

B00004W50Z|5.0|Yeah, all of the Band's albums are dark, and some are intense to  <br />say the least, but this record has Robbie and the other guys at  <br />their peak. This time, though, they are playing ROCK AND ROLL!  <br />Every track is a marvelous piece of lyricism, and the music is  <br />equally good. \\"The Rumor\\" has to be one of the ten best songs  <br />ever written anywhere by anybody, and The Band drive it home with <br />just the right amount of plot and passion. Don't pass this up,  <br />because music like this isn't created anymore. It may not be their BEST ALBUM, but everything by the Band is brilliant and just wait until you hear the sonic clarity here. Never in my life <br />have I heard music that has this much atmosphere and intelligence. OH, YOU DON'T KNOW how good this record is!!!
B000000OAH|5.0|Released in 1978 after the release of \\"News of the World\\", Jazz was a great mix of all kinds of music. By this time in their lives, Queen had made a name for themselves all over the world. This album is no exception to the fantastic stuff they had produced before.  <br /> <br />The first song, \\"Mustapha\\" is a song that is in a completely different language, but is still a great song. 9/10 <br />The next song, \\"Fat Bottom Girls\\" is too rock! Written by Brian May, it's a great tribute to the groupie girls that are committed to rock bands everywhere. Great song 10/10 <br />\\"Jealousy\\" is grossly overlooked, but is a fantastic Mercury song. It's a great love song about being jealous when you lose someone and they go off and move on. Piano and lyrics are top-notch here... 10/10 <br />\\"Bicycle Race\\" is the follow-up to \\"FBG\\", and is just as cool. The music video that went with it wasn't released until last year with \\"Greatest Flix 2\\", it featured about 75 naked girls racing bikes around a track in England! Too funny... 9/10 <br /> <br />A John Deacon song, \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\" is a fun rock song, very pop. Not something you would expect from Deacon, but still great. 8.5/10 <br />Next comes one of my favorites, \\"Let Me Entertain You\\", which is sick rock/glam combined with the semi-pompous attitude Freddie could pull off so brilliantly. 10/10 <br />\\"Dead on Time\\" is a pure Brian May (guitarist) piece, with rip-roaring guitar and a super fast pace. Another hard rock bit. 8/10 <br />\\"In only Seven Days\\" is sweet and another Deacon (bassist) hit. Almost completely piano and high pitched vocals, it's a great ballad type. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />So onto the last 5 songs. \\"Dreamer's Ball\\" my favorite song off the album. It is definitely an acquired taste because it is another one of those songs that Queen pulled out of nowhere and made a great song. It is a slow 60's country type song, and I love it! 10/10 <br />\\"Fun It\\" Roger Taylor's ode to disco. With a fun beat and great lyrics by the drummer, this song is surprisingly great! 9/10 <br />\\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" is probably my second favorite on the album, only because it is so well written. Anyone who has moved out on their own will like this song. Written AND sung by Brian May, it is a great song. 10/10 <br />OK, now for the best song: \\"Don't stop me now\\" is, as someone else put it, the song that Cole Porter never wrote. Mostly piano and drums, it is fantastic! 10/10 <br />Finally, \\"More of that Jazz\\" is the follow up to \\"Fun It\\" and is another great Taylor song. 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Jazz\\" is a fantastic CD, with almost every kind of song style imaginable. LOVE IT, recomend it to any rocker! <br />
1400082773|5.0|The next US Senator from the state of Illinois wrote this book nearly a decade ago, before his rapid rise to political power. Before anyone outside of Chicago's South Side knew who he was, Obama wrote a remarkably personal account of his childhood and life up to that time. <br /> <br />The subtitle of the book is \\"A Story of Race and Inheritance,\\" but it seems that the book is really about identity. Obama writes freely on \\"the puzzle of being a black man,\\" which is compounded for him by the fact that his mother is American-born and his father is from Kenya. He lives in Hawaii, then abroad in Indonesia for part of his childhood, reinforcing the fact that he is from two worlds but belongs to neither. He meets his father only once, around age ten. The author then wends through life up to his late twenties not knowing who his father really was. The point at which he finds out about his father's weaknesses is one of the more explosive moments of the book. Obama shares even this darkest moment with us. <br /> <br />Obama writes frankly about his idle years as a teen, his past fondness for pot and for liquor, but these preoccupations fade for him as he finds purpose to his life. He gives up a successful job in New York to work on the streets as an organizer, where he helps mainly poor blacks fight for fair housing and educational opportunities. But in spite of his passion for this work, his life is still incomplete. He writes, \\"my identity might begin with the fact of my race but it didn't, couldn't, end there.\\" <br /> <br />The pinnacle of Obama's young life was finally visiting his African family in Kenya, and although his father has already passed away, he has left behind a large group of people - - Obama's people - - who claim him as one of their own. It is during this trip where he receives his inheritance, which is not his father's practically nonexistent and disputed estate, but the wealth of information about generations past. Shortly after his first African trip,where this account ends, Obama begins Harvard Law School. <br /> <br />If it seems incredibly rare to find this level of candor in a political biography or autobiography, it's because the book is an autobiography about a man before he gained political ambition. This is what makes this book stand out so boldly from the genre: That a man could share some of the deepest parts of himself years before he sought high office is rare indeed. The 2004 edition of this book contains a new preface by the author.

Do Somethin' has fabulous music but the words are stupid.(Somebody pass my guitar, so I can look like a star? very cheezy!)  My Prerogative is a good song but I think she should stop using so many effects on her voice.  I've Just Begun(Having My Fun) is the best out of the new songs.(Even though it's not new.  It's on the IN The Zone DVD)  All the singles, ofcourse, are totally fabulous!  All together, It's a good CD.

0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is certainly one of the most unusual novels I have ever read.  Unusual from start to finish, the book is full of humor and absurdity.  The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, can be so infuritating at times, with his round-the-clock selfishness, ridiculous and sabotaging ploys, flagrant disrespect, utter laziness, extreme gluttony, and condescending ways, that I would love to strangle him as I'm sure many others would as well.  So what makes this book praiseworthy, since it lacks any real taste and decency, is that, despite the character Reilly's hundreds of flaws, as a reader you can't help but root for him.  You root for him in his endeavors, not out of sympathy, for there are very few people in this novel worthy of any sympathy, but because the longer he suffers the funnier it is.  His adventures with Paradise Vendors get better and better each day with Ignatius finding new things that reveal life is miserable.  His crusade for Moorish dignity is about as wacky as its title, but yet you want to see how far it will go and can't help but be disappointed when Ignatius calls it to a halt after his plant is knocked over.   <br /> <br /> There are several parts of the novel like these where laughing out loud can't be helped but for many other parts the humor is well-disguised in smaller details like the characters' mannerisms and the day-to-day conversations that Reilly doesn't enjoy with the many people he encounters. <br /> <br /> For those not intrigued by the odd humor, the storyline may string you along for longer than you might want.  For a large portion of the novel it is not clear how the many sub-plots will come together and the curiosity to know how they all relate will make you keep turning the pages.  Then when they do all finally come together at a rather climatic ending a groan from the reader can be the only response.  The ending truly irked me personally, for having been an avid follower of Ignatius's adventures and mishaps I reallydid want to see him suffer for everything that he put me through.
B000000OSE|2.0|These guys could easily have disbanded & never made this.    On ILLUSION 1 & 2 we're treated to a few pretty decent tracks, lots of filler, and tons of brilliant great-sounding Gibson Les Paul playing from Slash.    Overall I felt these 2 discs were a bit stretched, to put in mildly. They could have made one excellent CD seriously re-working the best of the songs, but instead it feels like they were eager to get out as much saleable product as possible before the band exploded. There really is a lot more coasting and self-indulgence here than concise, effective songwriting, isn't there?     Axl is sounding pretty okay, there's never been a singer like since so I can't complain if he can't quite tear it up as he did on APPETITE. Matt Sorum's precise powerful drumming gives the band a less garagey sound that almost dulls their edge in this case.    G'n'R sound like the rich new rock babies they truly are on ILLUSION. The title is almost and admission of guilt, can we blame them if we buy it?    2.5 stars in my book. And there are a lot of people who seem to use the voting button function in some sort of retard popularity contest (yes, we know you're a big fan, woohoo) but I reviewed this to honestly describe the CD not for your benefit but for anyone new to the G'n'R 'Illusion' recordings - this CD is a very mixed bag, and the band knows it.
B000066NW0|1.0|hahaha wow i hate this b*tch. in an interview she once said \\"i dont write \\"oh baby baby\\" songs, i write pure, hard, guitar driven rock.\\" hahahaha what a bunch of bullsh*t. i dont sense a smidgen of rock in this folk pop garbage. this crack [...]is not punk rock, and neither are blink 182, green day, yellowcard, good charlotte, simple plan, and so on. i find it kind of funny that she makes it up to look like she skates and shes \\"dangerous\\". im sure the only thing that is relative between her and a skateboard are the facts that she fell off of one when she was 10 and has been scared of them since, and she probly thinks \\"SK8ER GUYZZZZ ARE HOTTTTTT!!!!\\" i seem to see alot of that today. avrils influence on young america can already be seen. if u live in a suburban white neighborhood, just look outside and wait for some girls to come by. i see this everyday in my neighborhood. i glance out the window and some 12 year old girls walk by with \\"independent\\" shirts on and chains. later on ill walk by them and theyll be going .5 miles per hour on their cheap 20 dollar target skateboard down their driveway, ready to cry in terror. theyre all the same. Matrix Mark. what the f*ck is wrong with you. this isnt punk rock and if u think gimp dickskit is the best band on the planet u need a reality check. back to avril. boy shes a real gangster. pickin a fight with hilary duff, thats kind of dangerous. but im sure avril can do it, because shes such a punk!!!! so to all u 12-13 year old girls and middle aged loser guys who give her positive reviews, [...]!!!!! dont support her!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|I think any of us who are real rock fans, hoping for the next real band is a frustrating pursuit. <br /> <br />When APPETITE came out, all hell broke loose - they had not only a different sound than anything at the time, they had something totally missing in '80s hair rock - a feeling of danger. <br /> <br />Danger - like AC/DC on Dirty Deeds, G'n'R were here to let you know it was time to sh-t yourself because You're in the Jungle Baby, you're gonna die... The world on APPETITE is messed up, druggy, surrounded by vice and violence and chaos, maybe just a bare thread of survival and hope... and the whole mess sounds beautiful. THAT is rock and roll.
0802130208|5.0|Reviews of A Confederacy of Dunces almost always fall into one of two polarly opposite categories.  We either love Toole's humor or we are repulsed by Ignatius and are entirely immune to the comic aspects of the book.  Sure, we can attribute the lack of variety in the reviews as typical of any self-selecting poll.  In other words, only people who feel strongly about the book will respond, so all reviewers will have either fanatically positive or negative feelings.  But, logical as this sounds, if we look at other reviews we find a much higher rate of reviews of mediocrity, three stars, \\"it was OK\\", and the like, that seems to disprove this idea of apathy among the undecided readers.  Why, then, do reviewers feel so passionate about a comedy that promotes nothing? <br /> <br />The root of both the comedy of the book and many reviewers' hatred is Ignatius P. Reilly, the corpulent, egotistical anti-hero of the novel.  Whether we love or hate Ignatius ultimately determines whether or not we enjoy the novel.  This is not to say that there is no comedy outside of Ignatius' actions.  On the contrary much of the comedy comes from clever allusions to previous scenes, comic bits that we have to pay close attention to in order to laugh.  Take for example nearly any scene involving Patrolman Manusco in costume.  In one of his first costumes, Manusco wears a pair of Bermuda shorts and a red beard that he stole to complete his outfit.  After we hear of his ridiculous outfit, several unrelated scenes go by until a few pages later when Jones is riding the bus and sees a man in a red beard and Bermuda shorts being beaten by a man with a rolled-up newspaper.  This style allows us to remember and laugh at the setup for the joke, enjoy the scene itself, and also to anticipate some comic tie-in with nearly all of the absurd situations that Toole introduces.  When Ignatius writes that letter to Abelman's, we know that eventually a response will arrive and so we not only laugh at the letter but also in anticipation of what could happen. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, all of this comedy can be easily overlooked by either a reader who is either too hurried or insulted by the conduct of Ignatius.  If we hate Ignatius, we will be blind to all of the subtle humor that occurs around him.  All of Ignatius' comic power is derived from his utter disregard for everyone around him and his ridiculous ideas that he believes will improve everything.  To many people, this egotism makes Ignatius unlikeable past the point of being funny.  Or, maybe people don't like him because he is so cruel to his mother, because he is an absolute failure with eight years of college education leaching off his widowed mother and insulting her at every opportunity.  Whatever the reason, many readers are so repulsed by Ignatius' character that they hate the entire novel.  These people fail to realize one of the inherent truths of comedy, that all or at least almost all comedy is by nature cruel. <br /> <br />We can only find Ignatius funny if we can suspend rational judgement of the characters and realize that this is entirely a comedy, with every element present only to maximize the humor of the piece.  Sure, none of us would ever like to meet Ignatius in real life and would almost certainly detest him if we did.  But, taken out of the context of reality, Ignatius' ideas are utterly ridiculous and hilarious, and perhaps everyone too indignant to enjoy them should stick to the non-offensive comedy of network sitcoms or avoid comedy altogether because they just don't get it.  By no means does this mean that only the morally deficient can enjoy the book.  I consider myself to have firm morals and strong convictions, but I can put them aside in the spirit of imagination and laugh at Ignatius without being turned off by his faults.  Personal values don't preclude admiration of Toole's genius comedy, self-righteousness does.  Readers who did not laugh at this novel should first reread the book with a more open mind, and if they still cannot find any humor in the novel must face up to the sad truth that they lack a truly refined sense of humor.  We hate to acknowledge our faults, especially something as serious as a admitting that we don't understand what's funny, but by any definition of comedy, A Confederacy of Dunces is a masterpiece packed full of laughs.  Even if you're one of these unfortunates without a sense of humor, don't despair.  I bet you'll find this week's Marmaduke to be a gut-buster.
B0000035E7|3.0|The song \\"Pen Cap Chew\\" was never even finished because the recording tape ran out in the middle of the song. And it's not much of a song, either. It just has preliminary guide vocals like the studio version of \\"Token Easten Song\\" does. \\"If You Must\\" and \\"Blandest\\" belonged on Bleach instead. At least those are worth hearing. You ain't much of a Nirvana fan, buddy. Ya seem like a noob to me. Anyway, back to the debut and enough of my railing against the chump below... \\"Bleach\\" is a decent debut. \\"Big Long Now\\" deserved a place on the set too, but whaddya gonna do?
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Yes there there are a handful of performers and a bunch of performances that are missing from the show. The whole concert was about 12 hours long, the DVD however is only ten hours long. The reason for this, as explained in the DVD booklet, is that much of the footage was either destroyed or otherwise unusable. It seems that Live Aid founder Bob Geldoff had requested that the concert NOT be recorded or even shown again. Over in England the BBC recorded it anyway. In the US it was NOT recorded but someone at MTV kept all the alternate camera angle footage and locked in the vaults. In some cases the performances were never shown at all. The Who for instance blew up the generator and therefore only people at Wembley stadium saw half of there portion. In other cases the sound or picture quality was so bad it wasn't worth putting out. So even though there is stuff missing what is there is the best they could do. There is a performance by Ashford and Simpson that was believed to be totally lost. However at the last minute someone at MTV found it in an unmarked can, it still has the MTV graphics on it, but it is the only known footage of that performance. So all in all it's pretty cool to have what is here. For anyone who remembers the concert or just loves the music of the mid 80's you will love this DVD. <br />
B000002H33|5.0|In the 80's Metallica were the definitive METAL band, they were constantly doing new and exciting things in the metal world. So in 1986 they reached their creative peak with Master of Puppets (even though they jumped leaps and bounds creatively from Kill Em' All to Ride the Lightning)and created one of the best Metal Albums ever! This album deals with the weak and powerless. From Battery to Damage Inc. two of the fastest songs on the album to the doom of The Thing that Should Not Be. Then the anti-drug song, which focuses on concaine and the control it has over people Master of the Puppets which is arguably the best track on the album. Then comes the classic Welcome Home Sanitarium , next one of the great instrumentals in metal Orion. The great anti-war song Disposable Heroes, to Leper Messiah which is the weakest song on the album but is still a pretty good song. This album sold 3 million copies without any or little radio play and no mtv exposure. Before Metallica became repetive and boring before they lost the irreplacable Cliff Burton and before they sold out, this was Metallica and this is their best album period. Note: (If you get this you have to get Ride the Lightning it is just as good as this and more revolutionary)
B0001O3YD0|5.0|as i stated in my comments re: the chronicles of riddick dvd, i've viewed it now 8 times since i purchased it on wednesday morning, but i was confused lots about riddick himself! pitch black answered my questions and cleared up my confusion within the first 20 minutes! this is a tense, taut thriller/horror flick of the highest caliber, with some really superb action, special alien effects, great and imaginative cinematography (though on a much smaller budget) than the chronicles of riddick!   pitch black is awesome-the unrated directors cut in widescreen and great dts sound is a marvel-i really enjoyed it! but, the new chronicles of riddick, also unrated director's cut widescreen, is ultimately the better overall, of the two fine films! vin diesel is a marvel in both, with really fine support from 2 excellent casts. get them both for a full riddick experience-this really is the way that \\"star  wars episodes 1 & 2 really should have been. as it is, both films should be in everyone's dvd collections, if they are really sci-fi fans especially! now, i cannot wait for the next chapter in what is surely cult classic status.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This is where the focus should be when it comes to Michael Jackson.  Aside from all the scandals, the assumptions, and garbage; this collection definitly proves that Michael is deserving of the title he has been given.  I've been a longtime MJ fan and impersonator and feel awful for what the press has done to this man.  However strange he does sometimes appear to be, no one has the right to assume guiltiness or any of the other stories made up about him.  This collection solidifies his reign in the world of music and artistry. <br /> <br />The collection is well put together, great packaging, and it is also great to have the classic HBO concert on DVD to see the entire package.  The unreleased tracks are great with some of the later tracks, \\"In the Back\\", \\"The Way you Love Me\\", and \\"We've Had Enough\\" as the greatest.  I'm a little bewildered why Sony would release \\"Cheater\\" as a single when there are much more powerful unreleased songs on the collection.  The demo of \\"We are the World\\" is incredible. <br /> <br />I guess my only beef with this collection would have to be the title \\"The Ultimate Collection\\".  To us rabib MJ fans, this is NOT an Ultimate Collection by any means.  It's a great collection and wonderfully represents his talent, but there are so many overlooked jems.  Here's what I think should have been included:  <br /> <br />JACKSON FIVE - \\"The Love You Save\\" (the 4th number one in a row, it is on the DVD) <br /> <br />THE JACKSONS - \\"Can You Feel It\\" <br /> <br />MICHAEL JACKSON - \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (rare track, but was a video), \\"Streetwalker\\" (from the 'Bad' Special Edition\\"Heal the World\\" (is on the DVD), \\"Will You Be There\\" (theme from 'Free Willy'), \\"Scream\\" (duet w/ Janet), \\"Earth Song\\", \\"Ghosts\\", \\"Xscape\\" (unreleased - very popular with MJ fans of the Internet), \\"One More Chance\\" (from 'Number Ones'), \\"What More Can I Give\\" (unreleased 9/11 charity song). <br /> <br />Other than that, this collection is a wonderful reminder of the genius MichaelJackson is.
B000669GAI|5.0|Listening to this uncommonly well-selected greatest hits compilation, I was struck by an idea that this could be their \\"application\\" to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br />It summarizes an impressive career, in a fairly cool fashion. <br />It's two discs, the first with the more raucous tunes, the second with some of their \\"quieter\\" songs. Both are nearly chronological in order. So you get both \\"sides\\" of the band, and you can easily see their development over the years. <br />As you all know, they exploded on the scene back at the beginning of the '90's (hello Time magazine cover) with their debut, \\"Ten.\\" Lumped into the nascent \\"grunge\\" phenomenon, they quickly rose to prominence in the rock world. <br />Their popularity over the decade has waned, and I must admit I once thought they were \\"better\\" at the beginning than of late. <br />The brilliant thing about this set is how it presents their later music in context of their entire career, and let me tell you, the more recent stuff is eye-opening. Musicianship, lyrics...the only thing is I honestly think they're not as melodic as they used to be...but hey, no big. <br />These guys don't go through \\"phases\\", they've just grown, matured, developed...about as thoughtfully and creatively as any major band I can think of. <br />It's a tremendous value; I paid little more than the normal discounted price of a SINGLE CD at my local Tower Records. <br />Some of their earlier songs have been tweaked and remixed a tad by Brendan O'Brien, and it might be my imagination, but I thought the songs off \\"Ten\\", \\"Vs.\\" and \\"Vitalogy\\" sounded better than on their original CD's. <br />I haven't enjoyed a sit-all-the-way-through listen to an album as much as this in a long, long time.
B00020HEL6|5.0|If you have been wandering in the wilderness looking for the true path then gather 'round and let Sister Olstead lead you to the Promised Land. This girl can blow with the angels and rock so hard she will shake you to your soul. The cuts on this Cd have the good fortune to be beautifully arranged and well selected but without the voice to sing them they would be just good, with Renee they become great. <br />This child/woman sings like the jazz ladies of old and knows just when to bend a phrase to make magic out of music. <br />Buy this and you'll pray for stormy days when you can stay home, brew something hot, turn the lights down low and let Renee swing you away. <br />How such a kiddo came to find the jazz is a miracle but then miracles do happen <br />Don't let the initial brassiness of Renee's voice kill your interest. Like all great jazz singers, she takes what in any other singer's hand would be a career breaker and turns it into heaven. <br />There's only one thing wrong with this CD, Renee hasn't made enough of them. You'll listen and desperately want another only to find out that there is just one more. <br />Hurry Renee!
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I think we have not to compare old Alan Parsons Project thing with this album, mainly because IMHO an artist like Alan cannot stay in one style for too much time. Please think in every great artist and you can see, invariably, a path of experimentation, even the greatests rock and roll bands can be included in this pattern (think in Police, from '77 to '83 and you can see the latter is a quite different sound when compared to the former songs). <br />At those far days of \\"Tales..\\", Alan and Eric were pioneers (remember the vocoder thing?). I think he is doing the -only?- thing he know: trying another path, experimenting with another new sound. Electronica is here to stay, and IMHO Alan embraced fairly well the concept. Alas, after all, he's one of the founders of it, isn't he?. I hear in this disc a full exploitation of the sonic possibilities of today's synthesizers, he's an outstanding sound engineer and his skills are clearly demonstrated in some tracks. <br />Perhaps the most controversial aspect on this recording might be some lyrics, with a far reminiscense to some work of Mr. KarlHeinz Stockhausen, who experimented in the fifties with some effects made upon vocals sounds only. Some lyrics are strangely interspersed and cyclical repeated, and you may feel somewhat strange when hear this for the first time. Some lyrics can be qualified as \\"childish\\", inserted in some passages with some doubtful artistic intention, following the main rythmical movement on the song. <br />The volume is used as another resource to achieve the desired effect on the listener, Alan changes the volume on some passages and he does it very well (IMHO). On some passages, the synths sound very clear and with great presence, on others, the music is blurred and diffuse, evidencing a masterful use of these and other possibilities. <br />If you like electronica, this album might fit your bill very well, and you're right if you like it. If you are a nostalgious APP aficionado, well, perhaps you'll be dissapointed with this recording, and I think you're right -too- if you dislike it. <br />If I could resume this work in one word, this would be: \\"experiment\\". <br />Last, but no least, please forgive me for my english, I'm in Argentina :) <br />My 2 cents...
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Without a doubt, this is an amazing piece of musical work.  It's deep on many levels, and has a sound that is unbelievably unique and extremely unpretentious and honest.  In my estimation, Funeral is (by far) the best album to be released in 2004.<br /><br />Most reviewers have got it right -- it takes a bit to seep in, as in a couple of repeated listenings, but the album just keeps getting better and better each time around.  I listen to it at least once a day, it seems.  Truly an album that we may be able to show our kids one day and tell them: \\"This is what great rock was back when I was young.\\"  Although this band has garnered much hype, it is well deserved.<br /><br />My only worry is that this kind of album will be nearly impossible to top in the Arcade Fire's sophmore effort.  If they manage to even come close to the kind of album Funeral is with their next album, it will be an incredible feat.<br /><br />For the naysayer indie kids, I ask you this:  What exactly is your choice for album of the year in 2004, if not this one?
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Mr Miyazaki was active as a film maker before this movie. But factly the first movie that let people over the world know the reputation of Miyazaki was this Nausicaa, that is, as the directer and the original writer. About 20 years passed since the film was made, but we can look at Nausicaa with very pleasure, excitement etc. I am not able to believe that the film making was more than 20 years ago, very real animation, for instance the scene that Nausicaa helped the old man Yupa riding a animal who was followed by a holy insect, Oumu is that. At that time, Nausicaa helped Yupa by letting him know the escape way with riding a unique airplane, Meve. The scene that Nausicaa overlooked the surface from Meve was incredible real animation. Even if I consider that the movie is a old movie, the animation is marverous, that is, the scene that landscape aprroached near and near.  <br /> <br />The story of Nausicaa was wonderful. The movie implyed Miyazaki's anti war principle by using the intro scene,[Death Seven Days War caused by Gigantic Army], by the war, the world covered with Daath Acid. I think that Miyazaki made the scene while he knew the truth that there were a lot of falling acid after atomic bombs fell at Hiroshima in Japan under World War 2. I think that he not only made just a animation movie, but also was included the movie the important message. And the point is different to Disney movie. And when I looked at Aumu first time, I disliked Aumu for the grotesque looking. But as I felt the Aumu's deep tenderness, my emotion changed. Maybe Miyazaki will want to say what should see thorough the inner things, not outer things.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great movie that I am thought about many things, peace, love, tenderness, friendship and familyship, not only the real animation. <br /> <br />Thank you for reading my poor English. <br /> <br />  <br />
B000669GAI|3.0|I know I'd probably get a lot of \\"flak\\" for this, but I think \\"Ten\\" is the only good album that Pearl Jam ever released. It was a masterpiece. However, with each following release, PJ became so boring and formulaic in their never-ending quest to sound like a typical \\"garage band.\\" Plus their annoying political aspirations are such a turn-off. They never captured my attention again. After \\"Ten\\" they were a major \\"let-down.\\" Of course, every once in a while, they'd release a decent song or two that I'd like. The only problem was that these few songs were \\"sandwiched\\" in between a bunch of crap.  <br /> <br />Thankfully, with this release, we have most of those decent songs now without having to buy the mediocre albums that they first appeared on. I'm especially pleased that they included the two singles off of the \\"Singles\\" motion picture soundtrack.  <br /> <br />My major complaint with this collection are the \\"remixes\\" of the songs from \\"Ten\\" that Brendan O'Brien re-tooled. The songs were perfect \\"as is.\\"
B000002LQR|5.0|This album brings me back to the late 80s when i was listening to mother's milk.I thought that rhcp were so good with the whole funk/punk thing.But then when this came out it was a hammer smashing all the 80s funk ans showing true soul.For example with under the bridge and with i could have lied.Both showing that anthony keides can show emotion and not just insane covers.Buy this if u want to have me as a freind or if you want to be a normal human.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|After 'Let Go' recieved HUGE support and sold millions of copies worldwide, you can imagine how much pressure Avril and her team had on their shoulders to produce and EVEN better album. They pulled it off though. 'Under My Skin' released to rave reviews and has already sold millions of copies around the world. Personally, I love this album. Avril's voice has definetly become more mature and her song writing on this album is more mature than her lyrics on 'Let Go'. These songs have a much deeper meaning and a more serious tone to them. I'm going to rate each song out of 5 to give you a summary of this CD: <br /> <br />1. Take Me Away - 4/5: Great song to open up with.  <br />2. Together - 4/5: Another great song. I love how this song includes the piano.  <br />3. Don't Tell Me - 5/5: 1st single off of this album. One of my favorites. Girls will definetly love this song... about being a strong woman.  <br />4. He Wasn't - 5/5: Awesome song! One of my favorites. This song is the equivalent of 'Sk8er Boi' off of 'Let Go'. This song SHOULD be her 4th single off of this album.  <br />5. How Does It Feel - 3/5: Not my favorite, but I still enjoy it. Too slow for my taste. But, the lyrics and her voice are great in this one.  <br />6. My Happy Ending - 5/5: Her 2nd single off this album. I love it.  <br />7. Nobody's Home - 5/5: Excellent song. My favorite off of this album. This song is amazing... lyrics and her voice. This is the 3rd single released off of this cd.  <br />8. Forgotten - 4/5: Another awesome song. She can get her voice high on this one. This song reminds me of an 'Unwanted' off of 'Let Go'. <br />9. Who Knows - 4/5: Good song. More upbeat and happy. About living life to its' fullest and what not.  <br />10. Fall To Pieces - 5/5: My second favorite song off of this album. This one reminds me of a 'Naked' off of 'Let Go'. Amazing lyrics and her voice is awesome. <br />11. Freak Out - 4/5: Another upbeat and happy kinda song. Good though.  <br />12. Slipped Away - 5/5: One of my favorites. AMAZING lyrics. This  one is dedicated to her Grandpa who passed away earlier. Very moving and touching song.  <br /> <br />So that is the rundown of this album. If you love Avril, good music and REAL, TRUE artists... pick this one up. Peace =-)
B000001FFJ|5.0|This is my first Tom Waits album, and after listening to it nearly nonstop for the past two or three weeks, I'll say this: His reputation as one of the great modern American songwriters is more than well-deserved.<br /><br />NOBODY writes lyrics like Tom Waits writes lyrics. Not even Dylan. While Bob's best work frequently consists of cryptic, complex metaphors and symbolism, Waits' are far more direct yet exquisite in their (comparative) simplicity and the imagery they create. And on Rain Dogs the images consist of shady \\"small-time Napoleons\\" and lost lovers all looking for a way out of grimy, seedy downtowns. From the pirate sea shanty opener Singapore all the way to the end, this album is an embarrassment of lyrical riches. One of my favorite passages, from Tango 'Til They're Sore:<br /><br />\\"Make sure they play my theme song, I guess daisies will have to do/<br />Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews/<br />Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down/<br />Put my clarinet beneath your bed 'til I get back in town/<br />Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair/<br />Deal out Jacks or Better on a blanket by the stairs/<br />I'll tell you all my secrets, but I lie about my past/<br />So send me off to bed for evermore\\"<br /><br />Even if the lyrics were downright banal, Waits could lend them an air of authenticity with that incredible cavernous, ravaged growl of his. An acquired taste definitely, but I defy you to find anybody post-Howling Wolf who can sing with this much raw emotion. I challenge you to listen to the funereal yet uplifting closer Anywhere I Lay My Head and not have your heartstrings yanked right out. I want that song to be the last one I hear before shuffling off this mortal coil.<br /><br />Anyway, the best-known song on here, Downtown Train (later nearly slaughtered by Rod Stewart) is in my opinion the least of these tracks by far. I don't know, it just seems to lack conviction--Tom mumbles the verses, and the arrangement seems so straightforward, as if it was deliberately designated the \\"mainstream hit song,\\" or something. I prefer the looser, more inventive arrangements (ex. Clap Hands, Jockey Full Of Bourbon, Diamonds And Gold, Cementary Polka, the title track) with more percussion and odd instruments, and where Marc Ribot's sporadic guitar lines seem to take on a life of their own. No matter. Downtown Train isn't even close to being bad enough to stain the album, what with so many classics here.<br /><br />Highlights range from the aforementioned Singapore to the bluesy stomper Union Square to gorgeous gutter ballads Time and Blind Love to the jaunty banjo-driven Gun Street Girl to the gloomy spoken-word piece 9th And Hennepin to...well, the whole album. I don't care what you're into, your music collection is not truly complete without this. Five stars is not enough. Now I'm off to check out Swordfishtrombones and the rest of Tom's later albums, and if they're anywhere near the level of this my ears are gonna be happy for a lifetime.f it was deliberately designated the \\"mainstream hit song,\\" or something.

B000066NW0|5.0|Wow... some of you people reviewing this CD are HARSH. Obviously, you haven't really listened to the CD and are just conforming to the 'anti-avril' beliefs, which are based on this: \\"Avril Lavigne calls herself punk, which she really isn't, so that means that she must be a poser.\\" First off, she never called herself punk and that is a proven fact. So, put all of that bull aside and really listen to this CD and her newest one and you will find that this girl has A LOT of talent... so much more than any of you will ever have. Anyways... 'Let Go' is Avril's 1st CD and has sold MILLIONS of copies around the world. This CD launched her to superstardom in a matter of a day. Obviously, this CD has quality to it. Personally, I love this album... that is why I gave it 5/5 stars. <br />Here is a rundown of the tracks and what I've rated them: <br /> <br />1. Losing Grip - 5/5 <br />2. Complicated - 3/5 (yes, I know it was her \\"HIT\\"... but there are better songs than this one.) <br />3. Sk8er Boi - 4/5 (upbeat and catchy) <br />4. I'm With You - 5/5 (the best song on this CD, and I think one of the best songs she has ever made.) <br />5. Mobile - 5/5 <br />6. Unwanted - 5/5 (one of my favorites.) <br />7. Tomorrow - 5/5 (one of my faves out of both CD's she has put out.) <br />8. Anything But Ordinary - 4/5 <br />9. Things I'll Never Say - 4/5 <br />10. My World - 3/5 <br />11. Nobody's Fool - 4/5  <br />12. Too Much To Ask - 3/5 <br />13. Naked - 5/5 (amazing song... one of my all-time faves of hers.) <br /> <br />I hope some of you can put aside your beliefs that 'Avril is a poser' and REALLY listen to this CD (and her newest one) and maybe you will actually see the talent that she has. Peace =-)
0201485672|1.0|I'm surprised with the high Refactoring's Rating. I've read GoF Design Patterns and Fowler Refactoring is not able to reach the experience. Is simplistic, don't give you nothing new on OO programming, and don't have the category to became a classic. <br />Perphaps I'm not a great programmer (who knows...) but the Refactoring's seems a child story. I'm sorry, many people talked amazing things of Fowler UML distilled. Perhaps, but this is not the case. <br />For middle brained, s quarter of programmer, I don't recommend the book. Only if you're interested in something like \\"which're the refactorings (intuitive) algorithms to implement in some place\\" try it.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|If you buy this looking for a horror movie or scary movie you will be disappointed, however if you watch this as a campy action movie, its passable. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman gives an okay performance as the lead character of Van Helsing. Kate Beckinsale makes for an unmemorable \\"Bond girl\\" type sidekick. There are a few laughs, a lot of action, monsters galore and innumerable special effects. All of this comes together to make a James Bond style action flick as opposed to a monster or horror movie. <br /> <br />There's nothing particularly awful about this movie, but unless you're a fan of special effects, there's nothing particularly great about it either. It was entertaining once, but I think it would be boring for a second viewing.
B00029LNHS|5.0|This album is great.  The BEP are original in an age of un-originality.  Many of the songs are the kind that the beat sticks in your head all day - but in a good way. <br /> <br />I'd heard \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Shut Up\\", and \\"Get it Started\\" before picking this one up, but others are great.   <br /> <br />The main factor in my album ratings is whether or not I have to dive for the skip button - something I never have to do with this one.  With that in mind, it gets a 5.   <br /> <br />There's something here for everyone - which is why the 1 star ratings are just way out of line.  Go for it.  It's a great addition to any modern collection. <br /> <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first heard MCR On MuchMusic and decided that it was worth the money for the CD. That was over three months ago and the CD hasn't left my stereo yet. MCR is the perect mix of The Used and AFI. If you want amazing lyrics mixed with kick ass guitar get your ass to HMV and pick it up. Then let your friends listen cause they'll want it too.
0802130208|4.0|It took me some time to warm up to \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", but by the end I definitely appreciated the humor. The protagonist, one Ignatius J. Reilly, is someone I would never, ever want to meet in real life, but from a safe distance he's incredibly funny. That is Toole's greatest strength: the development of interesting and very original characters that defy stereotypes. I don't know if Ignatius is a genius, but I can say without hesitation that he is certainly unique. I can't think of any other character I have encountered that is remotely similar to him, from his...eccentric...personal hygiene habits to his advocation of a return to medieval society. The characters that might be stereotypical, such as Ignatius' drunken mother Mrs. Reilly or the witty black observer Jones, have more development and depth than mere stereotypes.  <br />Toole also conveys a regional flavor very well. The characters' dialects, the French quarter and other actual places, and regional characters all contributed to a very strong sense of atmosphere - the book did not seem like it could have taken place anywhere else because of how Toole intwertwined his setting with the story. <br /> The other thing that really impressed me was the intricate web connecting each charatcer. As I approached the end of the book and the events and characters became more and more intertwined, I found myself occasionally laughing aloud simply out of surprise at a new twist. (For example, the reappearance of Mr. Robichaux, the old man from the beginning...) I went from being kind of apathetic about what would happen to reading the end faster because I was so curious to see what would happen next and how all the twists and turns would be resolved.  <br /> In conclusion, I'm not going to recommend this book to everyone, because it isn't for everyone. However, if you have a flexible sense of humor (especially an appreciation of irony) and some patience, you will probably find \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" very funnyindeed. Just remember to give it some time, and don't be put off by the crude physical humor.  <br />
B00005JMUL|3.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" is the story of an unnamed boy who does not believe in Santa anymore.  On Christmas Eve night, while lying in bed, hears a train outside his window.  When goes outside to see what it is, he finds the Polar Express, which is on its way to the North Pole.  So begins his adventure.  Along the way, he will meet other children, a mysterious hobo, and have some amazing adventures, before arriving at the North Pole in time to see Santa off on the busiest night of his year.<br /><br />\\"The Polar Express\\" is both impressive and disappointing at the same time.  The characters are animated using motion capture performance, mostly done by Tom Hanks.  The characters look somewhat real, but are just enough off to look creepy at times (specifically the little girl, the elves, and the waiters).  The movements seem a little odd at times, and that is difficult to explain because they are based on real movements.  Perhaps it is just the animation.  The overall animation is impressive though.  The Polar Express and North Pole are fully realized in all their glorious detail.<br /><br />The songs are unmemorable, but the performances by Tom Hanks are good.  He gives life to numerous characters, some of them children, in such a way that you believe that they seem real and true to their age.  The story has been modified from the book in order to accomidate a longer running time, and it works to some extent.  The movie moves swiftly for the most part.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Polar Express\\" will probably become a childrens' holiday classic.  I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again.
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a very funny book and I would recommend it highly to comedy lovers of all tastes.  It contains the kind of grotesque physical humor one might expect to enjoy in a Marx brothers movie or low-brow cartoon like South Park, hilarious absurdity that would not seem out of place in an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, as well as more subtle irony.This is a novel full of bizarre characters and absurd events and situations, but the funniest parts are all centered around a very strange protagonist, Mr. Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius is an extremely interesting character, a completely unique personality. He is a gigantic man, who, at the age of 30 lives at home with his mother. Extremely independent and unconventional, he seems largely unaware of the real world, except as something that occasionally intrudes on his thoughts and whims. He does not know or really care how an adult is expected to behave. A Master of Arts in Medeival Studies, he writes polemics condemning his century and calls frequently and vocally for a return to the Dark Ages, the age of good, authoritarian popes, \\"decent kings\\" and the philosophers he admires. He refuses to leave the city of New Orleans, condemns anything new as a violation of \\"taste and decency\\" and abhors the idea of sex. He spends his life scribbling on tablets in a dirty room in his mother's home until one day financial crisis strikes, and he is forced to get a real job. Ignatius's (rhymes with pugnacious) half hearted attempts at interacting with real grown ups in the real world is one of the primary sources of humor in this novel. It is so funny because we see Ignatius as a character who is ridiculously unflexible, a man who is incapable or unwilling to adjust his thinking and behavior to events around him as society requires we do to work together and survive. This sort of mechanical inelasticity, according to comic theorist Henri Bergson, is present in anything that is funny to us,and it is definitely present in Ignatius with his unthinkingly self centered world view and his preoccupation (to the point of absent mindedness) with all things Medeival. Additionally, Ignatius's physical peculiarities and his lack of hygiene and table manners, as described by the author, add an aspect of physical comedy or bathroom humor, funny because it interjects what is taboo into unexpected situations, which will appeal to other readers. Other characters in the novel are important and contribute to its humor, but it is the protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly that really makes this book funny and worthwhile.
B00003CWL6|3.0|If this movie is about dysfunction, then the creators have succeeded.  They have displayed that dysfunction can range from non-communication to drug dealing to murder.   In the end, the message is unclear and somewhat alarming. <br /> <br />I can't say I hated this movie, but it is not what I call entertaining.  The story of a suburban neighborhood and it's off the wall residents does not ring very true with most of my experiences but writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes seem to want us to believe that what happens is fairly normal.  Maybe I mis-read their message.  Maybe they have no message.  It's possible that they're painting a scenario in which two dysfunctional families are thrust into each other's lives and the combination of certain elements (repressed gay father, drug dealing son, isolated daughter and her mid-life crisis suffering dad) is the catalyst for several events that normally would NOT happen on the typical suburban street.   <br /> <br />In any case and for the most part, I don't think the writer's story of these circumstances is a perception of real life.  It may be his perception as he grew up, but perception is relevant.  His perceptions may have been born out of his life growing up and what he experienced.  Between this movie and his work with the HBO show Six Feet Under, I have to draw the conclusion that he not only has an obsession with death, but he might be gay himself.  Please don't go off in a tizzy, there's nothing wrong with being gay.  But these days, gay people suffer hatred of those intolerant and his writing may be a reflection of the intolerance he has experienced.  Most writers write from what they know, and this may be no exception.   <br /> <br />But I could be wrong as well.  He may be just writing about gay people, in which he has written some very good work, exploring them as humans and their different facets.  We have a perfectly normal gay couple living on the street, as well as a gay father who is repressing his ownhomosexual tendencies.   <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey plays his role very well.  From the beginning we are made full aware of his daily anguish that he goes through trying to deal with his life.  What I don't like is the way irresponsibility is displayed as acceptable, and even praised behavior.  The creators are trying to make me believe it ok that a father can just quit his job to chase his youthful dreams.  It makes me really mad that the young teenager who is selling drugs is the one we are supposed to see as the hero when he comes knocking on the door of his girlfriends house telling her he wants to take her away to Amsterdam.  Do we think they are going just for the history?  No.   <br /> <br />This is my biggest problem with this film, that I can't see any reason to like any of the characters.  Relating to them is liking them.  No one seems to think they can be held accountable for their actions, and I cannot relate to that at all.  There are consequences to everything we do, good and bad.  And no one in this film seems to have consideration for those around them, and the story does not display this, except when you turn down the advances of a homosexual neighbor, then you may be shot in the head. <br /> <br />I mentioned before that I believe Alan Ball has may have an obsession with death, and if his writing is a message about living life to fullest before we die, then fine, I can understand that.  But life is about balance, and balance requires a dose of reality and doing what needs to be done as well as what wants to be done.  I'm sure we would all like to save time by not eating or sleeping, but we have to do it...or else we die. <br /> <br />Let me end on a good note; the movie is very well acted and photographed.  The performances by Spacey and Birch are top notch and Chris Cooper is always reliable as well.  The movie is watchable, if not a little slow at times.  In all, I would say it's a good movie, if you like movies that have no redeemable charactersand there is no good that comes from the story.  Please don't misunderstand, there is nothing wrong with this type of movie, it just isn't entertaining for me, and that is just my opinion, even if it is unpopular. <br />
0767834739|2.0|I would like to say that I am surprised by the responses that this movie was better than the first. It was terrible, it had lousy acting and the plot was extremely confusing.  <br />What is up with the dead people coming out of the ground in the cemetary? The virus is spread through a bite or getting injected with it. This movie was terrible...No story line, The action was lame too..
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This has GOT to be the best CD I've ever purchased!  Aside from having a bit of Ray Charles' history, the selections, artists he paired up with and arrangements are outstanding!  While he sounded so good on most of the songs, the gut-wrenching sound of his voice faltering slightly on a couple of songs only added to the personality of the whole CD.  I found myself on more than one occasion raising my hands and having a \\"musical religious moment\\".   God bless you, Ray...keep doin your magic!
B00002Z88D|5.0|I realize that 786 people have already written reviews, so I suppose this is kind of pointless, but I just had to share how much I love this album. I am not a longtime Metallica fan like most of you-- I'm too young to have liked them since the start. Anyway, I bought this album about a month ago and I have listened to it countless times. I'm not sick of it yet, which is a sign that it's excellent! <br />The first two tracks on disc one are instrumental; I guess they're an introduction or a warm-up for the band and orchestra. Whatever they are, they sound awesome. All of the tracks on this disc are great but I particularly like 'Of Wolf and Man' and 'Fuel,' two of my favorite Metallica songs that sound really cool with the symphony added. 'Hero of the Day' and 'Devil's Dance' are also extraordinary, and I LOVE the new song, 'No Leaf Clover' <br />The second disc contains many of Metallica's more well-known songs, such as 'Nothing Else Matters,' 'The Unforgiven,' and 'Enter Sandman,' all of which sound great. 'Wherever I May Roam,' 'For Whom the Bell Tolls,' 'One,' and 'Nothing Else Matters' are my favorites on this disc. <br />In general, I think the whole premise was very successful. The sounds of metal and symphony blend much better than one would expect-- the result is something that sounds the best in surround sound, but good anywhere. Parents, don't worry too much about the explicit lyrics sticker-- there are a few f-words thrown in that aren't in the original song versions, but it's not bad at all.
B0002XDODU|5.0|The evolution of rammstein is very present in the latest album. With a more softer sound but still rammstein sound. This cd still has very heavy pieces to it like Mein teil and morgenstern. Till actually sings and sounds very impressive compared to the almost spoken words of herzeleid. Fans will not be disapointed. As well as newer fans.
B00030590I|4.0|Much as Ang Lee demonstrated his directorial virtuosity in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, Zhang Yimou has applied his magnificent talents to the martial arts genre with HERO. This is movie not only worth seeing, but worth watching two or three times, or more. Each viewing unveils new appreciation for Zhang's artistic direction, Chris Doyle's cinematography, Tan Dun's musical score, and Itzhak Perlman's violin performance, not to mention fresh insights into the story line and character interrelationships.  <br /> <br />The story line is simple enough on its surface, based loosely on Chinese historical fact. The king of the Qin state seeks to unify the Seven Kingdoms some 2,000 years ago, and three assassins from the defeated Zhao state wish to kill him. An unknown warrior named Nameless, from the Qin state, succeeds in killing the three assassins and returns to collect his reward in an audience with the King. As we view segments of Nameless's explanation of how he defeated three such fearsome opponents, a battle of wits ensues with the skeptical King until the truth emerges. Their verbal sparring beautifully parallels the feints, thrusts, and parries of the martial arts scenes.  <br /> <br />Within this story line, we are treated to extraordinary, ballet-like martial arts contests between Nameless and the three assassins. Each scene is dominated by one primary color, from the opening desert white to the reds of the calligraphy school to the yellows of autumn leaves whose wind-swept swirls become weapons in themselves. A sword fight between Broken Sword and the King of Qin is cloaked in flowing green cloth, reminiscent of Zhang's use of colored cloth in JU DOU. <br /> <br />While HERO evokes memories of RASHOMON, this is not the same motif. The three \\"versions\\" of the assassins' reported deaths are rather more like the gradual unfolding of a Sherlock Holmes mystery. As the tale reveals itself, the relationship of the four assassins (including Nameless)moves from enemies to spurned lovers to companions working together and finally to a genuinely tragic (if seemingly platonic) love between two of them. <br /> <br />Several less recognized aspects of HERO are particularly worthy of note. First, anyone who saw Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE will find it remarkable that the same two actors could pull off the characters of Broken Sword and Flying Snow so successfully. Second, the game of Go played by the assassin Sky at the beginning of the movie magnificently foreshadows Nameless's successive movements in the King's presence from 100 to 20 to 10 paces. Third, the ballet movements in unison of the candle flames burning before the King are not only brilliant in conception, they mirror the closing scene's behavior of the King's faceless advisors calling for Nameless's execution. Finally, the juxtaposition of calligraphy brushes with swords and flying arrows is a dramatic visual rendition of the pen and sword adage.  <br /> <br />A last comment. Criticism of HERO as Communist Party propaganda is laughably absurd and demonstrates a severe lack of understanding of Chinese history. Qin Shihuang was a product of his times, no more or less tyrannical than the Egyptian pharaohs, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, William the Conqueror, Suleiman, or the American generals who \\"cleared\\" the Wild West of Indians. Regardless of his methods, Qin Shihuang accomplished a grand unification (All under heaven) that continues two millennia after his death. HERO evokes the founding of a nation and one unknown man's ultimate decision to sublimate his desire for revenge to the greater good of his country. That makes it no more propagandist than stories of Abraham Lincoln's struggle to re-unify the North and the South at the cost of countless thousands of lives, and far less pathetically propagandist than the recent \\"American hero\\" movies celebrating Jessica Lynch or Ronald Reagan. Americans need to take a long, hard look in the mirrormore often before screaming propaganda about the cultural work of other countries.  <br /> <br />HERO is not a perfect movie. The sword fight over the lake goes a bit over the top, the calligraphy/sword connection is overplayed, and Zhang Ziyi's character Moon too often feels extraneous. Nevertheless, HERO is a Must See for anyone who loves great story-telling and great movie-making.   <br />
0802130208|5.0|I'm not going to lie: almost every time I have ever been forced to read a book or story for any sort of class, I end up hating the book, just because I start to associate it with my teachers, or just school in general, two things I've never particularly liked. However, Confederacy of Dunces, which I had to read for one of my classes at Cornell University my freshman year did not suffer this fate at all; it is by far one of the funniest, most innovative books I have ever read in my life and would recommend it to anybody who considers his or herself funny. As an avid Simpsons viewer, I was delighted to see the tremendous (no pun on Ignatius' size intended) similarities between main character Ignatius T. Reilly and Star Trek geek, the famous Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons. Both characters consider themselves to be geniuses, surrounded by a confederacy of dunces, are disgusting goliaths, are extremely rigid in their actions, and the thing I find funniest, speak in such an outdated and complex way! I the case of the Comic Book Guy this means commanding Lisa by saying, \\"Answer me these questions three,\\" instead of speaking to her in normal order, or Ignatius whining, \\"My olfactories are already beginning to send out distress signals,\\" instead of saying, \\"This place smells.\\" The similarities continue: both characters live in towns filled with complete idiots, Homer exemplifying the dunces of Springfield, and Ignatius' mother, a prominent fool in Ignatius' world. Despite the fact that everyone around them is a complete \\"mongloid\\" as Ignatius would say, the hilarious thing is that these men are no less like children than Lisa or Bart Simpson: Ignatius still lives at home and relies on his mother for food and financial help, Comic Book Guy is obsessed with his comic book facts that have little value to anyone, both are unbelievably out of shape and often helpless because of this (in one episode, Comic Book Guy rips the back of his pants ice skating, and can do nothing, andIgnatius is limited in his actions throughout the novel), and the list continues. The most amazing thing about these similarities is the fact that John Kennedy Toole wrote this book nearly a half-century before Comic Book Guy ever made it into the world. That a character from a novel so long ago, can have a clone in one of the world's funniest shows of all time shows how hilarious of a character Ignatius is. Senses of humor change: watch Leave it to Beaver, and you might just have to kill yourself, and no doubt people from that era would be horrified at some of the things we find funny today. As well as being a great comedy with parallels to the Simpsons, the story itself is an intricate and well written series of carefully interwoven lives that affect each other in small but important ways until a fantastic and fitting ending that leaves you wanting much, much more. I recommend this book to everyone: it will have you rolling because of Ignatius' ridiculous antics, and devouring each page to find out what kind of problem he will end up in next. Read this book, if you've got a sense of humor!
B00064X3BI|5.0|After waiting through the bizarre back order situation that accompanied the release of \\"Slowhand,\\" when the SACD did finally arrive it was worth it. <br /> <br />I do not have the original CD or vinyl version of the album, so I cannot make a comparison to the sound quality between the two, but I can say that the surround mix done by Glyn Johns (also the producer of the original) is outstanding and very creative. <br /> <br />The best example comes from 'The Core,' where the surround channels contain the back beat, creating a cool point/counterpoint between the front and rears that really adds to the listening experience. <br /> <br />Other highlights are the atmospheric keyboards in 'Wonderful Tonight' and others.  Just an overall great effort.
0451191153|3.0|if you are like me-that is are looking for fiction and not philosophy-but don't mind the speeches-well this is the book for you. it is not a slow book nor a fast one-and all i can tell you is that you will like howard roarke for the simple reason that he is immensly likeable.  <br />     the debate between selflessness and selfishness-objectivism-well it's there-but you can ignore it  and read the book for the simple pleasure of reading. <br /> this is definately a easier read than atlas shrugged and in my opinion a better book---read it and decided for yourself.
B00064X282|4.0|The SACD version of \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" does sound much better than the CD version. With the surround mix, the separation of the music and the broader soundstage really helps compared to the CD. <br /> <br />However, the surround mix itself is inconsistent. It seems like they were going for an immersive sound stage, but the results are hit and miss.  <br /> <br />Right from the start, 'Motherless Children' starts off sounding like the left/right channels are just duplicated in the surrounds, with even the main drum track in the surrounds too. Then in the middle of the song the surrounds contain only what sound like the 3rd and 4th guitar parts. Not sure what happened.  <br /> <br />Other songs sound better from a surround standpoint, especially 'Willie and the Hand Jive' and 'Let it Grow,' but everything else in between sounds uninspired. <br /> <br />The most disappointing of all is 'Mainline Florida.' With it's layered guitar parts and keyboards, it should have been the best. But everything sounds shoved together in the front channels with the surrounds being an afterthought. <br /> <br />The extra tracks on the SACD deserve mention, because all three are great songs. The last one, 'Meet Me (Down at the Bottom),' also rates as one of the highlights of the disc from a surround presentation standpoint. <br /> <br />
B00031TXBI|5.0|That's right. He can't stop, and hopefully he won't anytime soon. John Frusciante has created another insane incredible amazing ground-breaking record. This feast of albums he has been generously creating for his die-hard and loving fans has been keeping extremely content over the last several months. But \\"Inside of Emptiness\\" is definitely the gem out of the lot. John Frusciante goes back to the roots of rock and roll for this album. Guitar distortion is beautifully used on some of the songs, particularly \\"Look On\\", my favorite song on the album. It contains a absolutely wonderful solo by John that lasts 1:15. There's no need for me to tell you about each song, only that each song is definitely amazing and beautifully written. Get this CD now.
B0000AYL17|5.0|This is quite simply the best sounding SACD I have ever heard.  Very crisp and clear, with creative use of the surround channels.  This is the one I put on to show off my system.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie is one of my best movies. They shows us wonderful friendship! They make me wanna be back younger age. They were relly good actors! I really miss River Phenix. He should have been a great actor if he was still alive. Anyway, I always like the stories written by Stephen King.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Well i had much to expect before watching this movie i have heard good reviews and just in general had a good feeling about this movie.... <br /> <br />And was i right??!?!?! i must admit my taste for movies has changed over the years the movies i enjoy are some what slower in pace but richer in depth. Movies that gives a smile on your face and makes you feel you want to be a better person you get the idea... <br /> <br />Whats good about this film is the fact that this film is not heaveyly driven by the story, the whole film seem to free floating and when you separate story and character you get lost in translation... the film feels its not scripted at all you just sit back and watch these people interact with eachother in a very unusual environment(japan)... <br /> <br />but thats not to say the characters are pointless there is a understanding connection between the characters, they know what they want but do not know how to get it... lost in their own dreams and visions finding it hard to distinquish whats day from night... but together they find a spark of hope that pushes them on... <br /> <br />Bill murray is good at what he does just be himself and he does a great job on it... scarlett is sweet and innocent, but behind those soft eyes you can see maturity and determination... and japan seems like a wicked place to be odd and would take long exposure to get use to... <br /> <br />I know the story at some stages were building up to a sex scene and it didn't and thats the magic of it the director want to show more of character and personalities those 2 people have then just get down and get dirty... <br /> <br />this is a film that takes more than just watching to enjoy one has to feel the characters really get into them once you're in you would not want to leave... <br /> <br />it would be great to know what bill said/wispered into her ears at the end... <br /> <br />Not your average cup of tea here only your best tea set is worthy of this film watch it and get lost in it... <br /> <br />***** 5 / 5 ******  <br /> <br />:)
B00003CXCT|5.0|Regardless of whether you like the old or new versions of this film, the trilogy DVD collection is a must own for any Star Wars fan. The special features and long lost trailers and tv spots are worth having alone.  <br /> <br />I own copies of the original films, before they were changed into the Special Editions, and must applaud the restoration of these decades old films. The picture quality of the DVDs is worth the price of the set by itself. <br /> <br />I saw Star Wars when I was 4 years old. I'm 31 now, and I must say that I'm glad they've been adjusted to suit the original vision Lucas wanted to achieve at the time but did not have the special effects resources.
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces, set in New Orleans, is the story of Ignatius J. Reilly and the events that unfold because of his mother's car crash into a building. Ignatius, like Quixote, belongs in a different century than the one his is living in. He is a fat, pugnacious man who enjoys watching television programs and movies only to ridicule them and annoy the people around him. By far, the funniest part of this book stems from the dialogue between Ignatius and everyone else. It took some time for me to get accustomed to Ignatius and his grotesque manner. At one point I was so revolted by Ignatius, I put the book down for a week or so. Soon enough, I picked it up again, in eager anticipation of reading about another of Ignatius' humorous escapades.   Toole writes the novel in a clear and lucid manner. With this book, I went on a journey through the streets of New Orleans from many perspectives. From Patrolman Mancuso, the pitiful undercover cop who cannot seem to overcome his run of bad luck to Jones, the street savvy black man working as a floor sweeper in a nightclub to Mr. Levy, the owner of a floundering pants factory, to Mrs. Reilly, the badgered mother of the irritating Ignatius, and Ignatius himself.  I enjoyed this book, and although it got somewhat repetitive at times, Ignatius' comedic mannerisms and ridiculous appearance drew me into the story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys ridiculous, verbal, and situational humor.
B00000I07P|5.0|This album and New Jersey are the best two albums put out by Bon Jovi.  If you made it out of the 80's and you don't now who these guys are, or entered the world after the 80's, this is a good album to start your collection with.  Good production on this album, so much so, you can almost smell the hairspray and lipstick.
B0000C8AVR|4.0|I really like this CD but the problem I have with Amazon is that they don't tell you on their CD page whether it is Multi-channel or simply Stereo SACD.<br /><br />Isn't there someone there with the knowledge to put it on the website so we know?<br /><br />I prefer Multi-channel SACD's myself. If anyone else is going through the frustration that I have try checking the artists home page for better info.

B000005HBI|5.0|Hands down one of the best covers of Tupelo Honey I've heard. For some reason this stands out as one Cassandra's best recordings to me. Great range of voice and songs in this outing.
0784011176|5.0|I love The Piano. The story is excellent and intriguing and the actors bring out the characters beautifully. Holly Hunter, who won an Oscar for this role, does very well in a role that requires no lines. She acts with her face and with her body and the her silence transcends the normal realm of communication. Harvey Keitel, whom I understand is usually the uber macho-man, struck the perfect balance between his macho masculinity and the true depths of George Baines. I'm very disappointed he didn't win the Oscar for this role because I think he does a wonderful job in this film. Jane Campion's directing is beautiful and the whole film reflects that.
B000002ADT|5.0|What else can be said about this record? No one over the age of 20 should be without this in there record collection. I'm constantly hearing things that I didn't before when i listen to this. It's one of thise albums that is alway fresh. Couldn't live without it.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I've owned this DVD for a while now and yes, I'm a Journey fan from the beginning.  Steve Augeri, front man, is awesome..he has the voice of an angel and captures the audience in the palm of his hand and has made the classics new again.  <br /> <br />Neal Schon's guitar riffs are like no other, no wonder he's known as The Rock God.   <br /> <br />If you haven't already done so, go buy this DVD..you will not be disappoined!
B000006MS3|5.0|Freaky and wonderful. This is one of my favorite Kate Bush albums. It will stand up to the music that's being produced today, and actually give it a run for it's money. If you like the sonic landscapes of Radiohead, then this album is something you need to pick up. Some find her voice off putting, but I think of it as an instrument in the arrangements. Good stuff through headphones.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|Iron Maiden is Known not only for being one of the best metal bands in history of Rock but also by offering their fans the best merchandise and the best products, This DVD is not the exception, this compilation of live perfomances and documentaries is one of the most complete archives and information available from the band, this is a great DVD just like the other DVDs from Iron Maiden, and of course this is the part one, so we can expect more DVDs like this one in the near future.UP THE IRONS ALL OVER THE WORLD!
B000068QY7|2.0|Heathen Chemistry is the biggest dissapointment to come out of britain.  I have  come to expect a strong and heartfelt sound from oasis, with catchy lyrics that i am not able to predict.  But on purchasing this album, I was immediately dissapointed.  It starts our somewhat decently with The Hindu Times, and progresses steadily downwards.  But even in The Hindu Times, the lyrics seem very trite and boring.  How many times have you heard a variant of \\"you're my sunshine, you're my rain\\"  And this song doesnt even flow into the next song.  when Force of Nature starts out, the intro is unispired and cliche.  And then the singer comes in, and you think \\"who the hell is this?\\"  The album progresses very uninspiringly until what i believe to be the high point, of Stop Crying Your Heart Out.  This is the Oasis that i want and need to hear.  The lyrics are something completely different.  The band seems to click in this track, and all the players seem to function as a single harmonious unit.  After the Intro, it goes into a classis AABA head format, that fits this song very well.  Once it breaks into the bridge, it is reaching a climax.  The guitar solo, although very simple, fits in amazingly well into the whole.  But then they ruin this incredible feeling you are left with 'three four' at the beginning of songbird, which is interesting maybe in the composition, but is static throughout the whole song, and leaves the listener bored again.  All the songs seem disjointed throughout the album and never have any connection.  Born on a Different Cloud is a good song, and at least the album ends on a positive note.  But in relation to  Definitely Maybe, Whats the Story? Morning Glory and The Masterplan, the writing can not compare, and the performance is uninspiring.  Many of the songs are completely static, and the lyrics are nowhere near what i expect from Oasis.  I want Oasis to be an Oasis.  Something refreshing, interesting and captivating, not the doldrums.

B0002JP4L4|5.0|I remember growing up with this movie in Jr. High. The soundtrack was introduced to me before I saw the movie. I loved every song on the soundtrack except for \\"The Girl Gets Around\\".  I mean it is ok. I also remember seeing the play a few years ago here in Dallas. It explained more detail on the preacher's wife, and Ren's mother. The trials they are going through and more thoughts about their husbands. They have a song they sing together about having inner feelings not to be shared. The preacher's wife staying so humble to her husband all through the years, and Ren's mom feeling trapped as well.<br />The movie was based on a true story. The producers/writers etc. went to small towns in Oklahoma. They attended their churches and listend to converstaions of the town. They found out becasue of some religous belief, that dancing was not allowed. So that is pretty much where the idea came to be about making a story/movie about that situation. Unfortunatly, religion plays a big part in a lot of places. I was glad to see that the kids in this movie stood up for their right to dance. Even if it was thought that dancing could lead to drugs/sex/violance etc. Religon can point out it can be sin or it could lead to STD's, Aids, pregnancy etc. As adults, we are responsible for our own actions. The point that Ren was making, there is a time for EVERYTHING under heven. The teens were not going to have a dance thinking it would lead to SEX/Violance/drugs etc. They were old enough to know what is right and what is wrong. It is so much a shame that we the people listen to the big churches and letting them \\"control\\" people's lives.<br />I agree that the transfer could be better, and that the sound is pretty lame.  However the film shines through all that.  Paromount can be lazy in the restoring/extras dept. I had the first virson and then traded it in for this version. The difference between the two is the extra features. The film and sound are the same. They go into more detail about how the film came about.  You can select 2 different commintaries. One with writer/producer. The other is with Keven Bacon only.  I have not had the chance to hear it all yet but i'll bet it would be worth it.he film came about.

B0006399FS|5.0|Dont listen to any of the negative reviews. This album delivers what all U2 fans want and have wanted for a long long time. I've only had it in my possession for 27 hours so pardon me if I change my mind over the next few weeks. I got the DVD version and its worth the extra 2 quid.    Vertigo -  Feels like a U2 classic already. I've played it more times than I have played Pop already.     Miracle Drug - is a drug itself - its addictive, its powerful and its very consuming.    Sometimes You cant make it... - as above. The chorus was a bit of a shock at first. I thought, oh ohhh... bit soppy. But after a few listens that chorus became the hook that makes you want to keep rewinding the track.    Love and Peace - this takes a little time. The intro is deceiving. The song is blues and the riff gets you hooked.    City Of Blinding Lights - I feel at the moment that this could have had a little more power. Its very Unforgettable Fire.    All Because Of You - This is a little like Wild Honey but with an edge. Edge playing his Coco Cola guitar gives the song its needed lift. Its very 'Even Better Than The Real Thing' in places. The double octave vocals are a let down as they were with Discotheque!!! It seems this song is a mash of other U2 tracks!!!    Man And Woman - Nice! Soulful.    Crumbs - Spine tingling. Classic. The Edge has entered the building. Nuff said.    One Step Closer - A slow, moody, lifting journey.    Original of Species - This song is rubbish! Its very weak. Seems like they ran out steam. Sounds like If God Would Send His Angels (blurrrrrgghh!) with the guitar riff from Pride thrown in to make it plausable!!! Sorry lads!!!    Yahweh - U2's biggest Filler!!! Sounds like a last minute thing. The last 3 tracks on this album are a big let down.    Fast Cars - a definate filler!!! U2 go Spanish!!! What can I say - it doesnt work fellas!!!    Even with the obvious fillers, its still well worth the wait and well worth the money. U2 are back and that is a FACT!!!Cheers
B00002E224|4.0|This is a very good movie, although sometimes I got myself watching the hours, because the movie is really slow paced.<br /><br />This is not a chick flick, but of course fans of only action movies will have a hard time going through this one here. But it's a solid piece of movie making, the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is unbeliavable.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Even after more than 6 months since I last saw the film at the theater, this film is still something that I can not get over.  If you purchase only one DVD this year, make this the one! <br /> <br />Now that all the controversy has died down you can watch this film and truly enjoy Mel Gibsons film making abilities.  His \\"in your face\\" style may have turned off some people, but I found it refreshing.  How could you not focus on the suffering of Christ?  How could you not show the violence he suffered through during his last 24 hours on this earth?  The violence is there to show his compassion for us, his utter love and ultimate sacrifce for us, even those who do not believe.  The violence was there for a reason.  I find it ironic that those who condemned the violence the most are those who consider films like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction to be works of genius.   <br /> <br />The acting is top notch.  James Caviezel must be nominated for Best Actor, as he turns in a performance second to none (and in a dead language at that!).  His portrayal of Jesus Christ was by far the best I've ever seen.  If he isn't nominated I will forever be sure he was robbed.   <br /> <br />But the great acting doesn't stop here.  Maia Morgensterns portrayel of Mary was superb and often brought me to tears.  She shows the love Mary had for her son and the connection between the two actors is amazing.  She often portrays emotion with her eyes, something I find many actors can not do, even the \\"best\\". <br /> <br />However, my favorite performance after James' was Histo Shopov as Pontius Pilate.  Wow.  This guy is amazing!  Where did Mel find him?  I don't know, but he should be in MANY more roles and I hope both he and Maia start appearing in films here in the US much more often.  His portrayal of Pilate was chilling and brought some humanity to this figure, which is difficult to do.   <br /> <br />Cinematography?  Beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  The imagery and photography are just amazing.I can't say anymore than Bravo! <br /> <br />Buy this film.  NOw!!!!

B000687M48|5.0|I waited for this new album for about 6 months, when I found out is was coming out. All I can really say is I am totally amazed, by the raw talent of lead singer, Amy Lee's, voice. From the first rift of Haunted, to the smooth Melody of Breath No More, to the pure energy in Bring Me To Life, Evanescence has had me singing along to the concert. The remake of Korn's Thoughtless, who honestly I don't like all that much, is just wonderful.  All in all, this concert/cd is a wonderful addition to any music fan's collection.  Now for a track listing for ya. <br /> <br />1. Haunted <br />2. Going Under <br />3. Taking over Me <br />4 Everybody's Fool <br />5. Thoughtless (Korn cover) <br />6. My Last Breath <br />7.

B0006399FS|4.0|\\"How to dismantle..\\" is littered with very complete tunes and although it has 2-3 weaker songs, overall it is a good cd.

B0002MB7QW|2.0|Roland Emmerich made \\"Independence Day,\\" a movie I really liked a lot .... so much so that I saw it THREE times in the theaters. Well, now Emmerich has taken the very same plot formula and replaced the giant alien spacecraft with giant weather catastrophes! It's all here: The harried scientist trying to warn the White House of impending doom, family members trying reunite with their loved ones, cars and trucks and buses tossed around like toys, spectacular scenes of citywide devastation, etc.<br /><br />But any crowd-pleasing charm there was in \\"Independence Day\\" seems completely lacking in \\"Day After Tomorrow.\\" Movies about aliens bent on conquering the Earth I can enjoy, since we have nothing in reality that such a scenario can measure up to. Global Warming, on the other hand, is a very real issue, something we all ought to be taking a lot more seriously for the sake of future generations ... but in this film Global Warming gets reduced to cartoonishness. Some of the science is worthy: The delicate balance of salinity in the oceans, for instance, can have a greater effect on ocean currents and weather systems than most of us would think. But Global Warming is such a long process, it wouldn't have made an exciting film, so Emmerich & Co. speed things up. A LOT. Meteorologists everywhere must have been CRINGING when they watched this flick.<br /><br />I'm giving this film a VERY generous two stars, mainly for special effects. I have to admit that the storm surge flooding of New York City was pretty well-done, and the spectacle of Los Angeles being flattened by tornados made me stand up and cheer! But I don't think the producers of this movie have ever seen a real hail storm; hailstones tend to be white and rounded and hit the ground at a pretty impressive velocity, whereas in \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" the hailstones are clear and jagged and appear to be dropped from the top of a ladder!<br /><br />Anyway, whatever eye-candy there is in this movie simply cannot make up for the laughably clich&eacute;d dialogue. It's really bad. I found myself talking back to the characters on screen the same way the bots do in \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\\" Sorry, I can't really recommend this one.up for the laughably clichd dialogue.

B00005JN4O|5.0|FINDING NEVERLAND is that rare work of art that transcends the medium of film and becomes a spirit-altering experience.  Strong accolades?  Gush?  Perhaps so, but squeeze time out of the clutter of life and the holidays to see this movie and be transported to a place that nurturingly reassures us that the cycle of life is indeed good.  Find Neverland!<br /><br />Marc Forster ('Monster Ball') has created a lovingly tender look at the playwright JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) in 1903 when, down on his luck with theater flops, unfulfilled by a marriage of Victorian standards to a beautiful but aloof and social climbing wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), and with writer's block, he encounters the Llewellyn Davies family - a widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill) and Peter (Freddie Highmore) - playing blissfully in Kensington Gardens.  Barrie is captivated, draws the boys to him with his patient and infectious enthusiasm for play, and bonds with this family, gaining the obvious seeds for his highest achievement or creation, PETER PAN.<br /><br />How these seeds grow, despite the soft, yet supportive, growling of his producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) and the not so soft interference of Sylvia's wealthy haughty mother Madame du Maurier (Julie Christie), form the storyline of this film.  The magic comes from the skill of the writers (Alan Knee and David Magee) and director, the cinematographer (never has Victorian London glowed with such elegant gaslight presence), and the musical score by Jan Kaczmarek.  Cameo roles are treated with tremendous respect: Eileen Essel as Mrs. Snow, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Kelly MacDonald as the first Peter Pan, etc all are brief but fully realized and poignant.<br /><br />Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits.  Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero.  Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving.  The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood.  Growing up has never been better portrayed -  by all of the characters!<br /><br />In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland.  No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play.  This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul.  Please don't miss it!

B00065GX64|3.0|I have to say the I don't know what is on this version, but I have owned the Criterion version of this film for more than five years and I think that it is brilliant, just as I think Metropolis is as well, but I am really sick of these studios releasing \\"bigger and better\\" versions of films.  You would think that Criterion would do it right the first time and not pull this sham to make even more money on the same film.  I have been trading up previous versions for those that claim to be \\"Special\\" and have not always been happy with the differences. <br /> <br />I don't know about all of you other DVD/Movie lovers, but I really am beginning to dislike studios that release a DVD and then, usually some short time later, release a bigger and better version.  Just give it to us up front!  Most of us are willing to pay for a better product, if that is really what we are getting.  We are already paying two or three times the price for Criterion DVDs, but to have to pay again for the same movie just to get a few more extras that should have been there the first time is ridiculous <br /> <br />So I am calling you on this \\"Criterion,\\" please provide the best you can and don't play the same game as the big dogs, or should I call them little dogs for trying to be petty in their attempts to squeeze more money from their loyal customer base! <br />
B0002YLC24|1.0|I know it's obvious that everyone loves this film because it's artsy and different, or perhaps they -want- desperately to like it because it's artsy and different, but from where I'm sitting, Before Sunset was possibly the dullest 80 minutes of my life.<br /><br />You could write a pretty good summary of everything that happens in this movie using no verbs other than \\"walk\\" and \\"talk\\", and the occasional \\"sit\\".  In fact, I will:<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, reunited after many years, walk around France and converse, not necessarily about anything of interest to anyone including, it seems, themselves.  They occasionally take a break from their walking to sit down, while continuing to converse and continuing to not say anything of interest.  The end.<br /><br />There, I just saved you the price of a movie rental and most of the time you would have wasted watching it, the exact amount of time depending on how quickly you read that last paragraph.<br /><br />You're welcome.
1400032717|3.0|_The Curious Incident_ attempts to critique \\"normal\\" thinking by viewing it from an outsider's perspective--in this case, an autistic \\"savant\\" 15 year-old.  <br />The plot is the best thing about the book. With its \\"mystery\\" element, it holds the reader's attention.  <br />However, the protagonist's narration is so deliberately stylized that it soon becomes cloying.  <br />I have read arguments that the book attempts to unrealistically \\"hero-ize\\" autism. Having spent a couple of years raising an autistic step-daughter, I would agree.  <br />The book is best taken as social criticism, and it is an interesting read overall.
B0006399FS|4.0|I don't know why. Maybe it's because of Bono being in front of news camera constantly, Bono shaking hands with politicians like George Bush, Bono venturing into a deal to make u2 I-Pods. Or it might just be my brother is a huge fan. As for his band, I own a couple of their CDS but I wouldn't call myself a fan.  <br /> <br />Because of my dislike for the frontman, I don't like to admit my love for u2 songs. But I do love their guitarist the Edge and his unique sound, and he carries this record. So yes, it is a very strong album. And yes, u2 will dominate the music world for the next year. Yes, it will sell millions. Yes, the tour will be the biggest of 2005. And Yes...we will all see Bono's face everywhere for awhile to come.  <br /> <br />The best songs on this album are Vertigo, Love and Peace or Else, All Because of You, and Miracle Drug. Not a surprise that Edge has amazing guitar work in all of them, especially All Because of You. Really, buy the record just for this track. I'm a big Stones fan, this is as close as it gets. He also sings a whole verse by himself on \\"Miracle Drug,\\" pretty cool.  <br /> <br />Rest of the album has good moments as well. Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own is actually pretty good, I wasn't expecting much after that excuse of a ballad called stuck in a moment on their last record. They hadn't released a great ballad since Stay off Zooropa, which was like back in 1994. But I think you can put this up there. Crumbs from Your Table is good, but One Step Closer is the best song off the second half of the record. Pretty deep track, and while I'm not a big Bono fan, he is a great singer and lyricist. Here he just goes one on one with death, good stuff.  <br /> <br />Overall, good record. For the people thinking about buying it, I would recommend it as non-u2 fan. As for the last album, I just burnt that off the net and never listened to it much after that. This album was bought and I'm guessing will be in my CD Changer for awhile.  <br/>
B00003CXZ4|2.0|A friend recommended \\"Memento\\" to me, because I am very much into suspense thrillers. However, I approached it with a wary eye, as it was recommended to me by the same friend who suggested I see \\"The Usual Suspects.\\"    \\"Memento\\" is unmomentous for the same reason \\"The Usual Suspects\\" was: It requires hanging all one's emotions as a viewer on the gimmick peg. For example, I stopped watching \\"The Usual Suspects\\" about 3/4 into the movie.    \\"It was just, frankly, boring,\\" I told my friend. \\"I lost interest.\\"    My friend screamed at me that I missed the big shock ending, in which Kaiser Sose is explained. I would've loved that movie, I was told, if I was simply patient enough to wait for the big payoff at the end.    I countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely-honed dialogue.    So, I went into \\"Memento\\" with a little more patience. I stuck with this one until the bitter end, and it was indeed bitter.    The gimmick in this movie, which I picked up a third of the way into the inaction, is that it is shot in reverse time. Its hero, played by Guy Pearce, who must have graduated from the Keir Dullea Space Odyssey 2001 school of cardboard acting, suffers from a memory disorder. He can't remember what happened the day before, so he must reconstruct it physically -- with Polaroid shots and body tatoos -- to create a history for himself, so as not to go totally insane.  He also is tracking down a killer (a device borrowed from Hitch). When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.    But, the story is told with painstakingly pedantic scenes and horribly fake understatement. I had no sympathy for the hero at all, and if it weren't for some very good acting by Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, I probably would have tuned out early.    The problem with \\"Memento\\" is that it tries to hard to be a film noir for our times, while ignoring just what it was that made those movies so memorable. Combing my mind, I cannot even think of one lesser film noir that was less entertaining than \\"Memento,\\" and no, I'm not forgetting \\"Johnny Stool Pidgeon\\" or \\"Detour\\" either. As far as \\"The Big Sleep,\\" \\"Out of the Past\\" or \\"White Heat,\\" forget about it! \\"Memento\\" is so far out of their league that it is an insult to compare this dreck with those great classics.    Watching movies requires, as we all know, the \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\" And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as \\"Dodgeball\\" and \\"Mr. 3000.\\" When it comes to movies, I admit I am guilty to being an escapist.    But, when something is just patently ridiculous that it defies belief, that's where I draw the line. In order to reconstruct his identity, Pearce has had tatoos embossed all over his torso. Okay, that's fine. I'll buy that.    However, just look at those tatoos: The producers obviously wanted them to look so cool that they went whole hog that they had a tatoo artist not just scrawl utilitarian messages on his body, but recreate the Sistine Chapel according to Marilyn Manson across his chest and arms. This one affectation comes off as more pretentious than the entire final script for \\"American Beauty.\\"    Of course, there are no scenes of Pearce actually getting a tatoo. They would be too laughable.  However, I can imagine what one scene from the cutting room floor might look like:    PEARCE: I need this tatooed.    TATOO GUY: What does it say?    PEARCE: \\"He has a gun, and he's coming for you.\\"    TATOO GUY: That's a lot of words, but if I just use navy blue, I can do it for you pretty cheap.    PEARCE: Cheap? I have $1000. Go to town, man.    TATOO GUY: Where do you get all that money? I mean, you live in a fleabag hotel, and with no obvious means of support.    PEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director. He said I've got to look \\"killer cool.\\" Use this CD cover as an example foryour fonts.    TATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool. Motorhead's \\"Sacrifice.\\" Lots of cool Goth script.    PEARCE: That's right. We're going after the MTV crowd: Nolan told me not to worry too much that there's nothing really cool about me at all, at least not in the Robert Mitchum or Elvis sense. Nolan said \\"image is everything,\\" so with these tatoos, and working out at the gym all day, so that my pecs look really ripped, I can't lose.    TATOO GUY: Bitchen, dude.    Of course, there is a bona-fide shock ending by the time this mess wraps up, but you'll figure out that Pearce is the killer long before he does.    If you have the intestinal fortitude to sit through this half-hearted art-school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller \\"Mirage\\" as the perfect antidote. A tightly-shot thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, Gregory Peck doesn't need pecs nor tatoos to deliver a convincing performance. Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue. He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.    He *acts* .
B0002XDODU|5.0|I ordered this CD before it was released in the U.S., paid $33 for it to be shipped here from Europe, and I don't regret it at all.  The CD is amazing.  I have to say my favorite songs are Mein Teil, Amerika, Keine Lust, Reise Reise, Ohne Dich, and Moskau.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes industrial / heavy metal rock music or anyone who likes Rammstein, as you will not be disappointed.

I would be slow to say it's their best yet, but it's in the top 3 on my list.
B00005JMAH|5.0|One of the joys about the Harry Potter series is that the style of the books matures with the characters. This is finally true with the movies as well.  Yes, this is a much darker film than the first 2...so is the book.  Yes, Harry, Ron and Hermione act more like real teenagers and less like 1950's television children.  There were choices made in this film that were risky, but in my opinion the risk paid off!  This is the perfect progression in the films of Harry Potter!
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I have been a huge Sarah fan for years, but i was hugely disappointed by this album.  It has a few good songs, but it seems as if this is her first album, with lyrics that strive to be meaningful but end up just sounding campy.  I think Sarah has become pretnetious over the years and believes all words she sins are poetry.
B0006399FS|3.0|If just about any other band had recorded How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, it would be the best album in their career, without question.  But when it comes to U2, it just doesn't quite measure up.  It slows down way too much in the second half of the album, and it feels a bit too artificial.  This is still a great piece of music, but in comparing to the most recent album from my other favourite band/artist, Matthew Good (any of you Americans who haven't heard of Matt Good...it's not a surprise, he has made little in the way of inroads into the States, but he has been quite possibly the best in Canada for 6 or 7 years now...check him out, I urge you), there's nothing on this album that stands out and leaves me wanting to hear it over and over again. <br /> <br />U2 is still really good...but maybe slipping just a little.
B00005ALP6|1.0|I think that the movie, My fair Lady was a really boring movie specially because I don't like musicals and in this movie even though we didn't see some of the parts where they sing still the movie was not interesting and I wouldn't watch it again.  <br />Now compared to book I think that the book is better because it has more to it. It is how Shaw wanted it and in the movie some changes have been applied like the horse race and also the way Eliza is. I think that Eliza has not been interpreted well in the movie because in the book we can picture her really poor girl that doesn't know how to speak well and in the movie she is not portrait like that. I'm not saying that she speaks really well in the movie but she speaks a bit better than how she really is in the book.  <br />I think that the movie was really boring and `like all the movies that come from books it followed the same routine of the book being better than the movie. <br />I think that Shaw's satire is not well adapted although there is some satire with the relationship of Mr. Higgins and Eliza; the movie has not enough satire to at least look like the book.
B0006399FS|1.0|this album should have been called how to dismantle a great band, because that what this album is. U2 ruin and put in a corner their career with this arrogant and safe Rock star album.

B000003TA4|5.0|Every song on this cd is awesome!  Smells like teen spirit is the best, and the only one ill talk about since if i talked about all of them, id die here at my computer.  Anyways,  it is a great song.  Its slow, but not in a bad way, but so you can enjoy the music.  Its fun and cool despite its age- 10 years!!!  its still popular after 10 years, and if it werent for curts death, this band would not only be legendary like it is now, but it would be Holy.  It is probably the best song curt ever wrote.   <br /> <br />This is truly a great band, and it will never die.   <br /> <br />Nirvana, Social Distortion, and Franz Ferdinand are my favorite bands.
B0006399FS|5.0|After having to listen to so many bands exercise the idea of anger equals intensity, the boys from Ireland are back to instill a more zen like aproach. <br /> <br />Starting with the always fantastic guitar work from Edge, the band slowly builds upon a shifting groundwork. U2 always seemed like one of the few bands that were better off spending lots of time in the studio tweaking their songs. Or rather, tearing down an almost finished song and rebuilding it again to make the song fight for what it's supposed to be. <br /> <br />No, the album isn't perfect, no, Bono's voice isn't perfect, and yes, some of the lyrics are hit and miss. But it's the album's sense of gusto that prevails in spite of itself that makes it so appealing. Kind of like a rough, imperfect surface with all it's cracks and pits is a more interesting visual inspection than something that is smooth to the touch.  <br /> <br />Speaking more specifically, tracks such as Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own and Love and Peace or Else have a great under current that keeps the song flowing even in the lulls.  <br /> <br />My only real gripe to the album thus far is that the regular release has only 11 tracks as opposed to the special edition, which has 12. The UK and Japan regular releases have all twelve as well. The missing song Fast Cars shows a band ready to have fun and the energy shows. I understand it doesn't fully fit the structure of the album, but it's a shame a lot of people won't be hearing it.  <br /> <br />And one more nit pick... Since when was the review section an internet forum? Seems like all the trolls and over voters are here, but why? Leave the bashing and blatant cheer leading for the discussion boards.  <br /> <br />Peace. Or else.  ^_^
B000059HCN|3.0|Requiem for a Dream is a very well directed movie, as it is very visually stunning.  The acting is also top notch, although there is very little depth to the characters.  The problem I have with the film is the fact that everyone seems to proclaim this movie as the most powerful film of all time.  For a person who has actually been apart of, or knows anything about the heroin scene, Requiem for a Dream will not be effective at all, in terms of scaring them away from drugs.  Realism is completely sacrificed for shock value, to the point where it seems like Requiem was produced by the government as an anti drug film.  Though it has setbacks, Requiem is, however, worth watching for the acting and the slick visuals.  The film also makes you think.  I would give Requiem 3.5 stars if I could, as it is a good movie.  Just think for yourself and do not take the happenings of Requiem as the gospal.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I have never read the book, but I found this movie to be really sweet.  It's the type of movie you can feel free to let your kids watch.  There are some great characters.  All of them have unique personalities.  That is part of the beauty of this movie.  The characters are not clones of each other.  They each have unique qualities about them.  You really get to know who they are throughout the movie.  I also like how the brilliant, yet impatient and selfish boy gets taught the lesson that he needs to learn.  Billy learns that he now has people he can count on in his life.  The little girl realizes that she is a leader (an honest leader, too).  The main boy learns how to believe, which is something we all need, not necessarily for believing in Santa Claus, but we all need to know how to do that and not get overly sceptical.  Great movie!
B0002UXBD6|5.0|\\"American Idiot,\\" Green Day's latest punk rock opera release has brought the band from a fading #9 or 10 TRL pop star position to this generation's Pink Floyd or The Who.  Comparisons come easily when examining rock operas which are usually few and far between (but easily my favorite), and while \\"American Idiot\\" may not be a \\"Tommy\\" or \\"The Wall,\\" this is coming from the group who's breakthrough album's name was a poop joke.  All of the tracks are strongly planted in the classic Green Day punk music that made them popular in the first place, with lyrics that are far more sarcastic, cutting, insightful, poetic, and emotional than anything they've ever done.  After frustratingly listening to a few samples from the internet, i felt obliged to go send them money and buy the real album.  I strongly suggest that anyone who is a fan of classic Green Day music as well as a taste for the epic, great lyrics contained within, to go BUY, or at least steal a copy of this album (just kidding about stealing, don't arrest me). <br /> <br />American Idiot has been termed by myself and many others as a punk-rock opera.  To some that may sound like a contradiction in terms, and maybe that's why this album is about a 9.9 out of a full 10; there is something lost in the translation.  All of the music is great, and varies significantly from song to song, and even in each subsection of the two 9-minute epic songs.  The music is all great, but the more cryptic aspect of the album is the storyline, as the songs are more snapshots of what's going on than scenes as might be found in a more linear or conventional rock-opera. <br /> <br />The storyline in and of itself could contain several pages of exposition, and is one of the most stimulating aspects of the album: piecing together the storyline, and interpreting how songs fit in with one another.  To give a BRIEF summary of my opinion, the main character, referred to as Jesus of Suburbia and St. Jimmy (two sides of the same coin), lives in asmall sheltered environment, becomes disillusioned, runs away from home to the even colder world, which though more real is difficult to deal with.  Then, in order to cope with the difficulties and challenges of the real world Jesus of Suburbia takes on a more St. Jimmy approach to life, doing drugs, and numbing those pains (hence the song, \\"Give Me Novocaine\\").  Then Jesus of Suburbia/Jimmy meets a girl, Whatsername, who ends up not being able to handle Jesus/Jimmy's proclivity for ignoring problems rather than dealing with them, breaks up with Jesus/Jimmy, and forces Jesus/Jimmy to reevaluate the punk/rebel lifestyle he's been leading.  It ends masterfully in homecoming with the Jimmy side of Jesus committing \\"suicide\\" and Jesus realizing that though his former life may not have been \\"true,\\" the comforts of home and family outweigh the value of reality.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is easily the best album out this year, and is likely to be the jewel in Green Day's punk crown.
B000007NYS|5.0|I am completely in love with this album.  It seems to fill a space that no other music ever fills.  I've heard her compared to Bob Dylan, but that's only because she's an excellent songwriter, same as Bob.  This album has a few songs that are just absolute stand outs.  They are:  \\"Somethin' About What Happens,\\" (acoustic version) \\"Like a Rose,\\" and above all, \\"Abandoned.\\"<br /><br />If you read any of my other reviews, you'll find this message is often present:  Why doesn't country music radio and the industry in general embrace this remarkably talented artist along with some others?  It's as if there is someone down in Nashville who says, \\"If we keep pushing garbage, country music will disappear...\\"  Maybe that's what they want.<br /><br />Anyway, buy this album.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  This woman is a living legend.
B0006399FS|3.0|The best u2 years have finished. This Cd doesn't have something new. There are few songs i liked, like miracle drug, original of the species, and City of blinding lights. But other songs like Vertigo, love peace or else, are very boring. and some very stupid like crumbs on your table. <br />
B00006L7XQ|5.0|If you don't know Cash, you need to get to know him.  After 40+ years of touring, songwriting, living the road life, and just bein' a total hardass, he still managed to make one of the greatest albums of all time.  You can hear the shaking in his voice from his disease...<br /><br />  Rick Rubin has made a real reputation for himself by re-vamping old legends (see Dice Clay, Danzig, Cash) and discovering new talent.  Not only is Cash re-vamped on this epic album, it is almost a final testament to his life...the last pages.  Eerie but wild.  The video for \\"Hurt\\" became somewhat of a hit, but every song on this album is awesome.  A pure and honest mix of old school and new school.  The best of his American Recording albums.
B00006EXDM|5.0|It is now 15 years since i got this album for christmas. Since then i have heard all sorts of great music. But Hot Rocks is still my favourite. It does not sound like a collection of singles, the songs match each other very well. The songs grow both in length and complexity throughout the album. The songs are all good examples of the Stones' qualites: freshnes, energy, catchy melodies, provocative and funny lyrics. But it took me quite some time to fully see the qualities of Hot Rocks, all the songs do not sound spectacular at once. But it gets better and better the more you listen to it. The only snag is that the sound quality isn't always great. We don't usually consider \\"greatest hits\\"-albums among the candidates for \\"the best album ever\\". If they were candidates, this would be my pick.
B000001IQH|5.0|...AND OUT COME THE WOLVES is possibly the best set of songs ever put down on wax.  I've read several reviews on here claiming things like \\"rancid sold out,\\" or \\"these guys are wanna be Clash!\\"  You guys need to get a grip.  Rancid is just punk enough and not over-the-top.  There are plenty of over-the-top punk/hardcore bands out there.  There's this whole movement in the punk community to be super punk and hardcore DIY etc, but that's not what the punk movement was about when it started...that being said, Rancid is definetly not weak!  They prove something on this album that has only been proven on a few other albums in the history of punk: PUNK CAN BE \\"REAL\\" AND SOUND GOOD TOO.  Bands like Green Day, Blink 182, and countless other poppypunky-spunk boy bands are, arguably, sell outs/posers/radio rock...but this album is about the closest thing to white soul music you can find.  Every song on here is masterfully written and played with enough heart that it'll make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Of course there are a few hits; the album kicks ass kids.  If you don't already own it and you are thinking of buying it, do so.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.
6304698623|5.0|I cried almost from the beginning.  I remembered how I loved my dad even though he was away most of the time and I remember feeling how I most likely didn't cross his mind much.  I cried more for the father in this story than for the child.  This movie is incredibly casted, acted, and filmed...a classic which will endure.  My new favorite...my old favorite was Casablanca.
B0006399FS|5.0|I bought the CD yesterday, and when I first heard it I thought, \\"what is this??\\" But I must warn you, listen to it a few times to absorb everything.  I can tell this is another u2 grower, which is good signs for me cause all of my favorites from them are like that.  Good job mates.
0141439513|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.<br /><br />I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read.
0446677450|1.0|Im a finance major, and I work for a leading investment broker.  I would like to think I know a little about financial management.  Some stranger came up to me in a bookstore and was telling me about this book.  Long story short, he was with some Quixtar/Amway variation.  This book is motivational fluff.  In Kiyosaki's other book, Prophecy, he states that 401(k)'s are a scam and some idiotic stock market crash is coming to wipe out everyone's retirement.  Funny how none of my finance professors ever heard of this.  If you want to beleive this nonsense, go ahead.  You deserve whatever happens.
0060920084|5.0|I spent this last summer reading the entire collection of Bryson's books and after much thought and energy give THE LOST CONTINENT: TRAVELS IN SMALL TOWN AMERICA the prize for being his finest work to date.  <br /> <br />As a writer, Bryson combines the genres of travelouge with personal memoir and in LOST CONTINENT achieves that unique voice that is all his. Always able to deftly combine erudite scholarship with personal insight and extremely salty humour, Bryson leads his audience through a personal journey of not only the American landscape but also his spititual topography as well. <br /> <br />As he journeys across small town America- in a search for \\"Anytown USA\\" (an amalgam of all those MGM/Capraesque bygone hamlets), he wistfully searches to reclaim all the memories of his father. His father, a sportswriter, apparently led the Bryson brood on a multitude of spendthrift odysseys. As Bryson retraces the journeys of his childhood he relives so many rich memories that alternate between the comical and the honestly nostalgic without resorting to cheap sentimentality. <br /> <br />Bryson constantly reveals little known histories and local color all the while criticizing and celebrating the subtle nuances that make up the American landscape. He takes shots at the obvious- strip malls, over commericalization and cheap tourist traps in ways that both raise the reader's ire and appeals to the sense of whimsy as well. <br /> <br />Probably Bryson's greatest trick lies in his ability to inspire his reader to undertake similar journeys. <br /> <br />A great read. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|one thing is clear: U2 fans are very, very polarized. Ironically, the situation of which the band has not take any musical risk with this album, is a big risk that has put in danger their entire reputation for million of fans, including me.     There're some facts nobody can refuse:    1- Fans are very polarized.  2- Everybody's talking about U2, for good or bad.  3- This album is not risky at all.  4- Bono's voice is getting worse.  5- The album is short.  6- The album is commercial.  7- Production is ineffective.  8- There are some good lyrics and melodies.  9- Collector's edition with that 48-page \\"book\\" is a waste of time.  10-The album isn't Rock, overall is a calm CD.    I really don't want to say \\"U2 sucks, U2 is dead, U2 is sold, etc\\" I just want to express I dislike this album. That's all.
B000059HB7|5.0|Like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, CHARADE, KING KONG, JAWS, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, and THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (and too many others to list is such a small space), RIO BRAVO is as close to perfect entertainment for the sake of escapist satisfaction as there is.  <br />Containing the quintessential John Wayne performance as Sheriff John Chance as well as sterling work by Dean Martin, Angie Dickinson and the incomparable Walter Brennan, RIO BRAVO is a finely crafted story that doesn't contain an extraneous scene or misplaced piece of dialogue. The pacing is solid and the framing is economical and purely functional.  <br /> <br />Howard Hawks was known for directing strong ensemble casts in tight adventures and this is certainly no exception. He truly was an actor's director as he obviously encouraged his casts to create and communicate small morsels of behavior that richly enhance his direct and unpretentious storylines. A Hawks film, to me, is a goldmine of subtle and effective acting choices. If good acting is about, according to David Mamet, completely serving the script and completing objectives through action, then RIO BRAVO is a compelling and fine example of screen acting at its finest.  <br /> <br />RIO BRAVO is a film that doesn't taint with repeated viewings. If it does not rest on your DVD shelf it is time it did. An American classic. <br /> <br />Although, I must add that it is high time for a deluxe edition DVD with a stronger and richer transfer. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I have read many, so many fans reviews and so far this is the best title I found to express what I feel of U2 now. I'm not going to say bad words against U2 members, but I have to say bad words about their music. My first toughts about this album were so so. But now, the more I listen it the more I dislike it. After 4 years ( the longer time between one album and another in U2's history, since between Zooropa and Pop were 3 1/2 years ) U2 give us such a fraud album, with radio friendly songs, with no attitude nor new ideas. I really don't know what to say to express how bad I feel. I've been U2 fan since 1984 !!! I have 35 years old and I was used to be surprised with every U2 album until Pop, in 1997. Then they shifted to safe and more friendly music with All That You Can't Live Behind. Now with this album songs are very commercial intended and recorded, production is nothing special, as well other instruments like strings, keyboards, piano, etc. Is very annoying to listen Bono's voice now, trying to reach higher notes with his rough voice. Edge stopped to invent new guitars forever. Larry is boring, as well Adam. Guitars are always the same ones. Sorry for these words my friend, but this album is only an excuse for money  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I think it is most ironic that independent filmmakers claim to despise the mainstream Hollywood film in favor of making \\"personal cinema\\". When one considers the work of director John Ford it becomes so obvious that he was very much a part of the \\"system\\" and yet made several stunningly personal films.  <br /> <br />His films hold up well today because they display his personal love of character, land, place (there is a difference), time, honor, tradition and ritual. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is one of his finest pictures. His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting, searing and highly religious narrative.  <br /> <br />I agree with many other reviewers who believe that the film is largely leftist propaganda. Certainly the other great political film directors Leni Reifenstahl and Sergei Eisenstein can be see in many of Ford's compositions- as is the case with the masked tractor trooper montage. But propaganda, like the very medium of film itself, operates on pure emotion. This film is loaded with one emotional image after another.  <br /> <br />The photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life Magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionsim. There are so many frames that could stand proudly next to the works of Adams, Bourke-White, Wood and Robert Capa as examples of photographic art.  <br /> <br />The cast is uniformly excellent. The sincere and utterly real performances of John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from an Actor's Studio graduate.  <br /> <br />Enough cannot be possibly said about Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad. How fitting that Fonda would play Henry Stamper in the film version of Kesey's SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION as Old Henry S. really is in many ways Tom Joad all grown up. Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film. He was not just an American icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.  <br /> <br />The script retains much of the best of Steinbeck's novel and many of its great quotes. Yes, it does preach, but never at the expense of the narrative. This is a lesson so many \\"serious\\" filmmakers have yet to learn. The film has not dated in THE GRAPES OF WRATH is about a specific time and place in American History yes, but it is also about what it means to be a human being. In that sense it transcends nationalism and is a fine work of World Literature. It is an equal with CITIZEN KANE as one of the finest films ever made. <br /> <br />Now finally available on a beautiful transfer DVD, THE GRAPES OF WRATH, with his glowing silver and black images belongs on any serious film fan's shelf. <br />
B0000026KQ|1.0|When this album came out, there was a great deal of hype surrounding it.  I (being a huge Beck fan and mindful of his highly under-appreciated \\"There and Back\\") bought the hype.<br /><br />Sadly, I also bought the album.  No, it's not as absurdly bad as works like \\"Flash,\\" but it's up there (or should I say \\"down there\\").  That's the thing about Beck:  when he's on, he's the best.  But when he's bad....phew.......<br /><br />Another reviewer said it best in that this sounds like someone doing a cheap imitation of Beck.  Save your money.
B00006DEF9|5.0|And while I probably don't have anything particularly new to say about this, one of the 10 greatest films ever made in the history of motion pictures, I do none the less strongly urge any and all fans of great movies to add this celebration of life to your permanent film collection. Especially now with this crisp deluxe DVD transfer which gloriously captures the rich colors of director Stanley Donen's expert eye.  <br /> <br />I am not a great fan of musicals per se, but this film is something far more than a simple genre picture. It is a celebration of the creative muse.  <br /> <br />At the central core of the narrative is the very real lesson to be learned from acting teacher Constantine Stanislavski: \\"Love the Art in yourself, not yourself in the art.\\" Kelley's \\"Don Lockwood\\", Donald O'Connor's \\"Cosmo Brown\\" and Debbie Reynolds' \\"Cathy Seldon\\" all succeed because of their undying will and love for very art of performing and creating. Comedic villain \\"Lina Lamont\\" as portrayed by the excellent Jean Hagen, is undone by her shallow devotion to her own celebrity.  <br /> <br />The film, besides being one of the most legitimately uplifting and entertaining experiences an audience can ever enjoy (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a far more effective anti-depressant than any prescription!), also is a historical accurate depiction of the drastic paradigm shift that occurred not only in film, but in acting history as well. The coming of sound brought drastic, and cataclysmic changes in acting technique. No longer could actors, like \\"Don\\" and \\"Lina\\" do what they always did- \\"Just add talking\\". While many folks do (and in many cases, rightfully so) believe that a large part of real acting died with the coming of sound, an entire new industry of Acting training resulted- hence the need for teachers like Stanislavski and others.  <br /> <br />In fact, this film has been an important part of my high school acting curriculum for several years. It is refreshing to see how big an influence this film has on all ages. Especially teenagers addicted to violent clap trap, big budget exploitation flicks and rap music.  <br /> <br />The New York vs. Los Angeles acting rivalry. The comical over enunciated vocalization, the purposefully \\"cheezy\\" recreated musical numbers (\\"Beautiful Girls\\" is classic!) and a very real depiction of how one built an acting career (barrooms to strip clubs to Burlesque to Vaudeville to Broadway to films) are all historical elements that lend the film depth and strength.  <br />Gene Kelley, perhaps even more than the great Astaire, was a great artist who combined a fierce alpha mail athleticism to his mastery of all dance styles. Here, he excels in telling stories through not only tap, but ballet and jazz as well. Debbie Reynolds was never better as the innocent yet strong willed ingnue. She and Kelley (and along with Cyd Charrise) create a real sexual chemistry. Anyone who is not convinced that dance can not be a substitute for explicit sex needs to see the utter taste and class depicted here.  <br /> <br />Donald O'Connor steals the show with his rubber face and impeccable timing. O'Connor's dancing is impressive also- especially in the \\"Moses Supposes\\" number in which he matches Kelley step for step. His \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" teaches Jim Carrey a thing or two about how to make broad physical comedy appealing and not obnoxious.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, like all great films and other works of literature, Singin' in the Rain holds up perfectly to repeated viewings. It is a fresh and vibrant the 100th time as it is the first. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|To all those people who submitted the first wave of bad early review, first off, this CD is not a cure for cancer; it will not feed the world, or eliminate war. It is simply 50 minutes plus of music by U2, great solid CD filled with good songs, played brilliantly by one of the best rock bands of all time. For all those who were expecting more, go back to your Bon Jovi. Let us real fans get some more positive review in for five starts.
B0006399FS|4.0|Estamos claros que no es un Achtung Baby, un Zooropa o un Joshua tree.  Pero es un disco menos Comercial y \\"light\\" que ATYCLB; mejor Musica y Letras.   <br /> <br />Claro, sin embargo se pierde cierta creatividad \\"tratando\\" de volver a las Raices y no haciendo alguna innovacion en la musica, como Si lo hicieron en los 90's. <br /> <br />Es un buen disco hay que darle la oportunidad, y hay que escucharlo varias veces.
B0006399FS|5.0|What I think people don't understand about this album is that it is less political and spiritual than U2's previous albums and far more...*intimate*.  This is a personal record, and singing about the intimately personal - familial relationships, in particular - is a new angle for U2.  Although there have been love songs and songs about death before, never have these all been on a single album with the concentration that they are here.  I think that what some here are upset about is the fact that intimacy and tenderness are sides of U2 that most of are not used to hearing; in short, it's not what people have been expecting. <br /> <br />Bono writes and sings as a father and a son on this album - and I am unaware of any other songs that reflect this (save \\"I Will Follow\\" from their first album \\"Boy\\", but these lyrics are about his father and they have a very different tone).  \\"Original of the Species\\" is an ode to youth and its two-edged sword of optimism and naivet - one that many of us, in looking back, can relate to.  It is a song for Edge's daughter that Bono writes with the eyes of a father (it is a beautiful song).  There are two songs about his own father on this album, \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\".  \\"Sometimes...\\" has some beautiful, beautiful lines in it: \\"It's you when I look in the mirror...You're the reason I sing, you're the reason the opera is in me...\\" <br /> <br />This isn't to say that politics and spirituality are absent from this album: they aren't.  Songs such as \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" are intensely political: \\"Lay down your guns, all your daughters of Zion, all your Abraham sons\\" (from \\"Love and Peace or Else\\").  Furthermore, \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" are a wonderful marriage of the political and spiritual; from \\"Miracle Drug\\" we hear \\"Beneath the noise, below the din, I hear a voice - it's whispering - in science and in medicine, 'I was a stranger, you took me in'\\" (this quotation being a quotation of Christ).  \\"Yahweh\\" is the unspeakable name of God from the Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Bible; from the song we hear \\"Yahweh, Yahweh, always pain before a child is born.  Yahweh, tell me now, Why the dark before the dawn?\\" <br /> <br />Musically, this album is a mix of October-War and Achtung Baby, with a good bit of All That You Can't Leave Behind thrown in.  In short, it is very U2.  \\"Vertigo\\", if you haven't heard it, has a really boisterous post-punk edge; \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" has a very Oasis-esque feel.  Of course, all songs are drenched with Edge's time-delayed, signature guitar sound; Larry's drumming is strong and Adam's bass sounds better on this album than it has ever sounded, I think.  It is fun to hear the slide guitar used a good bit on this album.  I think Bono's vocals are about where they were on ATYCLB; they seem weaker to me than they were in the late-90s, and I think he has a hard time hitting some of the higher notes.  He does it well on \\"Sometimes...\\" and it is refreshing.  But frankly, I think he needs to lay off the cigarettes.  Like \\"Sometimes...\\", \\"Closer to Knowing\\" is a beautiful ballad with both acoustic and time-delayed electric guitars.  \\"Yahweh\\" is a bit more song than psalm; it lacks the eloquence of \\"40\\" and \\"Grace\\" but it is still a great song - and prayer - to end the album with. <br /> <br />For those that are upset with the album and say that it is banal, I think that they are simply looking for a cookie-cutter band stuck in the 80s.  This album isn't their loudest or their most political or spiritual.  Is it their best?  I don't think that question can be answered in any definitive way as they have had so many great albums.  But, this is undoubtedly their most tender and intimate album to date.  If you want to genuinely *listen*, then pick this one up.  For this listener, it is a voice that is unexpected, but welcome and well worth the wait.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is a complete collection of Shania's \\"signature\\" songs. Reading the contents, you can find every song that put her \\"on the map.\\" If you're even just a casual fan of hers, you will agree that this is what you'd call a definitive collection. <br />At the risk of contradicting myself, a couple of songs are not included.(\\"Dance with the one that brought you\\", and \\"what made you say that\\") But since this collection focuses on her more recent hits, that's barely worth mentioning. <br />All in all I would say get this cd, and like it!!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish has really outdone themselves on this one.  First off, the songwriting is first rate -- even the heavier songs are infused with great melody (Dark Chest of Wonders).  Tarja's vocal's are less operatic this time around but the new found restraint perfectly fits and lends more emotional impact to the songs (Nemo).  The orchestra is really brought to the forefront in quite a few tracks (Dark Chest of Wonders, Creek Mary's Blood, Ghost Love Score).  Even when it is not up front the orchestra is in the background which makes for an interesting multi-layered sound.  The mixture of orchestra and band is very organic.  Perhaps similar to Metallica's S&M but more integrated and well balanced.  Many of the songs have a very soundtrack feel.  Specifically, there is a large Hans Zimmer influence which occasionally approaches the limit of being \\"over the top\\".  However, this is a good thing since Tuomas has perfectly blended his soundtrack influences and melodic heavy metal into a seamless whole.  Highly recommended.  One of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  This release definitely deserves to be huge.
B0006399FS|4.0|When i first listened to this album i wasn't really impressed but i wasn't really listening to is, but then i really started to listen, and i have three songs on this album, that i believe are three of their very best. Miracle Drug, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own and City Of Blinding Lights. Now i don't believe this is the best U2 album Achtung Baby has that title, but it is truly a great album. <br /> <br />The only problem with U2 is that they are so good, their B-sides are better then most bands albums for gods sake, that you constantly expect magic from them, you expect and wait in anticipation for \\"Where the streets have no name\\" and \\"Ultra Violet\\" etc.. and they do sometimes come close, maybe on their next album they'll do magic U2 style, but as it stands there doing great things and this is a great album.
0670033693|5.0|I absolutely adored this book!  As a mystery fan, I am always excited to find a new writer to add to my list of favorite \\"who-done-it\\" authors.  Mr. Johnson's plot is well-crafted, intriguing, and responsible for the tremendous back-ache I received after not budging from the sofa until I finished this book.  As a Wyoming resident, I am delighted at Mr. Johnson's ability to capture the quirkiness of the people who live in this amazing state.  I hope another book from Craig Johnson will follow quickly, since I'm dying to find out more about Sheriff Longmire, Henry Standing Bear, and the others in Absaroka County, Wyoming.
630521610X|5.0|Ahhh...what can I say about ' scream ' that hasn't already been said ? This is the movie that refreshed a horror gerne and introduced a gerenation to \\" the rules \\" of surviving horror  movies. The movie starts with an infamous opening that all started with a phone. But the story really focuses on a young teenager named Sidney Prescott ( who lost who mom one year before to a tragic rape/murder ) who gets thearenting phone calls. There are her horror-movie loving friends who are considered suspects. There is Tatum, Sidney's bold/sassy best friend. Randy Meeks, the friend who has a love for horror movies. Billy Loomis, Sidney's paitent but troubled boyfriend. Gale Weathers, the noisy reporter. Stu, Tatum's boyfriend. And Dewy Riley, Tatum's brother and officer in the police force. And in the end, we get a great ending, with surpising twist and motive.  <br /> <br />I think I would probably conder this Wes Craven's second best (behind a nightmare on elm street of course ! ). It has everything a slasher flick needs . It has gore, suspense, mystery, and above all.....self-assuranced teens who think they know horror movies rules but don't know what to do when they realize they are in one. This movies starrs Neve Campbell, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGown, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, and Matthew Lillard.  <br />This is a great slasher flick for a dark friday night. The extras on the DVD include trailer, audio commentry with director and screenwriter, and also interviews with the cast and crew. I would recommend to ANYONE who enjoys slashers!
B0006399FS|1.0|the people in u2 are so big and rich that they could put out whatever kind of album they want without really consulting with anyone. unfortunately, this seems to be excactly what they decided to do, and guess what? it sucks. they can't even count in spanish.
B0006399FS|4.0|I have been seeing this album getting panned and compared to their 80's work. This now 20 years later and they have decided to strip down and do a rock album. This is one of the things that appeals to me. The sound is more raw then it has been in years, their playing is on the top of their game. Sure the writting is not Bono's best and it's not political or sociall concious. I think they were going for a straight rock and roll album. The song does get a little more on the religious side, All Becuase of You and Yahweh, than in the past. <br /> <br />With that being the case this is one of their best albums (the only realy really terrible one being Pop). I would recommend this album to any U2 fan. My favorite song on this album is the one that everyone has been panning. Love and Peace or Else great blues riff with interesting textures.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|just like visiting an old friend. u can actually hear all the sound-effects that were not apparent on the 1994 release. the extras are killer, and well worth the wait to see. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001FN1|5.0|I first heard this album back in 1989 when a friend let me borrow his tape. I was truly blown away by the music and the singer's powerful, and I mean POWERFUL vocals. That Saturday, MTV's HeadBanger's Ball showed the Warlock video 'All We Are'. From then on I was a feverish fan of Doro Pesch. I even named my car after her.<br /><br />'Triumph and Agony' is the last and greatest of the four Warlock albums. This album should have thrown Warlock into the super-stardom range. But alas,with America's fickle tastes, plus the sexist attitude that a female could not lead a 'true' metal band, Warlock quietly disappeared. Doro went solo and who knows what happened to the rest of the band.<br /><br />The album starts off powerful with 'All We Are', which is an above average stadium anthem. From there it's 'Three Minute Warning', a true metal tune that delivers the goods. Other jewels on this album are 'Metal Tango' and 'Touch of Evil'. Doro's scream at the end of that song is equal to what Rob Halford could belt out. The album ends with the beautiful 'Fur Immer'. I have no idea what she;s singing about, but I love it.<br /><br />I don't know if it's on the CD, but on the tape the last song on side one is 'Make Time for Love'. After the song there is a pause and then DOro says 'Hey, turn it over. Turn it over.'<br /><br />All in all, this album kicks butt from start to finish.
B0002CHHMA|5.0|I am grad I purchsed this album from Amazon weeks ago. Carla has s very sweet voice and those songs are lovely. It's too bad Amazon doesn't have much information about this set, it's a Korean limited edition, it has a EXTRA booklet translated in Korean, and a 10' by 13' beautiful POSTER! (not the same picture on the cover). Although I don't understand Korean, but the poster is worth it.
B000006TRV|3.0|This is the first Floyd album I heard; and I have to admit that I was enthralled when I first heard it. It has some really good songs like Comfortably Numb and Hey You but taken in comparison to how many songs where actually on the album and the cumalitive quality of previous albums (especially Animals, Dark Side and Meddle) I feel comfortable giving this album 3 stars. <br /> <br />The music on this album, overall, was simply not as good as on previous albums. Animals for instance, is much shorter with only five songs but the music, in my opinion, is captivating. I say the same for Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle and the live disc off Ummagumma.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Keeping track of the storylines and characters is confusing at first.  It almost has the feel that the writers brainstormed romantic or heartwarming movie plots, felt there wasn't enough meat on any one to turn into a movie and then just combined the batch of them. <br />One silly storyline has a goofy 20-something traveling to America because American girls go ga-ga over a British accent.  Another story shows a loyal wife discovering evidence of her husband's infidelity.  This one probably merited a whole movie of its own, as the wrap up on it was somewhat inconclusive.  The Hugh Grant as prime minister plot was fun, but again needed to allow more development of the love interest. <br />Despite that, the film grows on you and by the end, you're celebrating each feel good solution.  What started as a miscellaneous selection of people, does pull together and interconnect.   <br />Other plots in this movie: <br />*widower reaching out to grieving son <br />*betrayed writer falling for his Portuguese housemaid <br />*rock star making a comeback <br />*lovelorn office worker afraid to approach co-worker <br />*actors developing a shy romance amid filming a porn movie <br />*a best man hiding a secret passion for his best friend's bride <br />*young boy trying to impress the most popular girl in school <br />That's all the plot lines I can remember now.  Think of it as 10 movies in one and just go with it.  Many funny and touching incidents, so once you sort it out, it's enjoyable.
B00005JMCT|3.0|I've been a big American Pie fan since the beginning. I love the characters and all their odd quirks. Jims sexual disfunctions, Finches pretensions and obsessions with his MILF, Stifler and his profanity, Jims Dad and his eyebrows and Michelles flute box all make me laugh time and time again and so it was with great anticipation that I saw American Wedding the summer it came out. <br /> <br />It was funny and it was great seeing old friends but some of the heart was missing and the pie had grown stale just a tad. Something about focusing the entire movie and Stifler just threw the chemistry off. Jim was the viewpoint character in the first two flicks but Seann William Scotts popularity had eclipsed that of Jason Biggs and thusly he dominated the movie at the expense of the other characters. <br /> <br />Scott is fun to watch but you can't take an ensemble series and turn it into a one man show which is what they did so it didn't entirely work. When they worked the rest of the cast in the movie excelled. It was really the overemphasis on Stifler that really dragged the movie down and I consider myself a Stifler fan. But Stifler works better in small pieces of the pie not in huge chunks. <br /> <br />Its still a damn fun movies, especially the unrated version, but it ranks slightly below the first two pies for me.
0399241515|5.0|I ordered this book from England before summer and read it on our family trip during the summer break.  Horowitz combines in this Alex Rider tale much emotion and I really felt Alex come alive as a character to his full extent.  Two thumbs up for the action, drama, excellent plot, and the climatic ending that almost could have you in tears.  Also, I would just like to thank Anthony Horowitz (who like J.K. Rowling) really showed in this book that not everything or everyone is always going to be portrayed as black or white (good or bad).  There are some gray characters in Scorpia and that only made me appreciate Horowitz's skills all the more.  And don't worry Horowitz fans, book six in the Alex Rider series is available from England in May 2005!
B0006399FS|1.0|Another comercial and safe hype,that's this \\"new\\" album.All That You Can't Leave Behind was the first part of this album.Now we have more distorded guitars, but in the end is pretty the same comercial intended kind of albums. So now we'll have to wait until 2008 for more of the same. 2 bad albums and you're out, someone said... therefore U2 is out.U2 has become the most overrated classic band, every new song is received with devotion,w ith bowing, screams, caps down, etc, but just for think, which was the last truly great and unforgettable song? Staring At The Sun or Please, from Pop...7 years ago. Even some fans say Stay,from Zooropa...11 years ago.  <br />The band looks and sound tired, Bono looks and sound awful both with his long hair and rough voice. The band plays boring,with such lack of ideas that's something to worry about. Like a fan said recently, \\"while there're many younger bands who can't sell half of any U2 record (Radiohead, Coldplay, Travis, Keane, etc) these old men can sell easily 10 millions with any crap,just because they're U2, a big music company. A shame, really shame\\".  <br />Overall the album sounds flat, and producers didn't make any great job here, given the songs don't go anywhere, both sonically and musically.  <br />This album should have been just an EP containing:  <br /> <br />1- City Of Blinding Lights  <br />2- All Because Of You  <br />3- Miracle Drug  <br />4- Crumbs For Your Table  <br /> <br />all the rest of the album is simply nothing.They're so obsessed in composing \\"the best album from all times\\" ( now just an stupid and repetitive Bono's cliche ) than they forget how to make A WHOLE ALBUM, not just separate songs put togheter in a decent tracklisting. A great album is something you have to experience as a whole, not skipping any track. But here you can easily skip 5 songs from this record, including the tuneless Vertigo, one of their worst compositions. U2 now think their albums too much calculate, and they forget the main thing: make music, no snappy craps, no big comercial marketing, no big hypes. Nobody believe in Bono anymore with his same words again and again before every new album after Pop \\"this record is our best collection of songs ever\\". They don't sound naturally here, no mention to hoarse Bono's vocals and the same ( now boring ) Edge guitars he has used on ATYCLB. I'm sure most of reviews are paid by their management, because is pretty weird to see many fans disapointed by this album while the press caps down with this average album. U2 now keep stand at the top because of their extraordinary 80's and 90's albums, when the band wasn't obsessed with more and more awards and \\"their best album ever\\".  <br /> <br />It's time to go home, really U2. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Irish supergroupU2 (\\"rock's only remaining superpower,\\" according to one reviewer) is back with their first new studio album in four years, and this solid but surprising effort has many elements that make it well worth the wait. 2002's \\"Electrical Storm\\" and 2003's \\"The Hands That Built America\\" gave no hint of the direction this album would take.<br /><br />It may not be the instant classic of its advance notices, but How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is a soaring, atmospheric journey and a worthy successor to 2000's brilliant \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" In fact, in its best moments, Atomic Bomb sounds, if anything, like a direct continuation of that album's highest musical achievements. It's easy to hear some of the new songs falling in place right alongside ATYCLB's more memorable tunes. \\"Vertigo\\" seems a logical lead-in to \\"Elevation,\\" \\"Walk On\\" a natural follow-up to \\"Yahweh,\\" \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" is a spiritual stepson of ATYCLB's \\"Kite.\\" That said, this album stands on its' own, and has a unique view of the world that incorporates the changes we have all endured in the years since ATYCLB's sunny, optimistic melodies soared out of our radios in late 2000.<br /><br />Pre-billed by the band as a hard-edged, guitar driven record, HTDAAB is anything but. The opening song, Vertigo, certainly hits that preconception right on the money, but the rest of the album is a quiet, almost somber record that accepts the reality of today's challenging world while evoking more than a few memories of U2 songs past. Vertigo actually sounds contrived and forced, as if the band had it in mind to manufacture a \\"hit single.\\" The end result of such efforts is invariably that the finished product sounds, well, manufactured. Bono's vocal style is ill suited to the demands that such a silly rave-up makes on him, and while the song has grown on me, the band sounds uncomfortable executing it.<br /><br />It's possible that the band started out to make an up tempo rock and roll record, then discovered when they got into the studio that their hearts just weren't in it. This certainly seems supported by the surprising transition into \\"Miracle Drug,\\" the album's second tune. MD is a soulful, deeply emotional song about a paralyzed schoolmate of the bands' who was helped by a new drug therapy. The song is full of wonder at the miracles of science, and takes an opposing view from traditional Christian perspectives on experimentation and \\"playing the hand you're dealt.\\" Maybe it is an ode to stem cell research, but regardless it is a wondrously executed melody driven by Bono's heartfelt vocals. Layers of background vocals soften the overall feel of the song and offset Edges' driving guitar work, even as he pushes the song to a rising finish. It's a personal, memorable tune.<br /><br />Miracle Drug transitions into a soft, almost crooner-ish intro to \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own.\\" Easily the albums best song, SYCMIOYO features Edge conjuring up the memory of early U2 songs with his metallic, echoing guitar work. Bono's vocal is phenomenal, and the lyric is uniquely personal and direct as he works through his relationship with his late father, who passed away in the middle of the Elevation tour in 2001. While ATYCLB's \\"Kite\\" took a philosophical perspective on his fathers' inevitable demise, this song is fully about a man in grief, and Bono throws himself into it with the passion and intensity of someone who really doubts he can get by without his moral compass. SYCMIOYO is almost like a personalized version of Pop's \\"Please,\\" but this time focusing the pain and desperation inwardly at his own heart, instead of outwardly at the tragedy of world events. Both songs are brilliant, but SYCMIOYO will resonate long after the memories of Sarajevo have faded.<br /><br />Other songs are almost as memorable. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" walks a tightrope between sappy sentiment and a refined, glittering guitar riff that evokes fond memories of \\"In God's Country.\\" \\"Original of the Species\\" and \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" deftly walk the razors edge between the personal and political, never going too far and yet making their points with force and passion. \\"Yahweh,\\" the album's closing hymn, is the group's most overtly religious song since October's \\"Gloria,\\" and finishes the album on a humble yet rousing tone that leaves the listener on a musical mountaintop.<br /><br />In the end, HTDAAB is work of greatness that while not necessarily extending U2's legend, at the very least confirms it.es fond memories of \\"In God's Country.\\" \\"Original of the Species\\" and \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" deftly walk the razors edge between the personal and political, never going too far and yet making their points with force and passion. \\"Yahweh,\\" the album's closing hymn, is the group's most overtly religious song since October's \\"Gloria,\\" and finishes the album on a humble yet rousing tone that leaves the listener on a musical mountaintop.  <br /> <br />In the end, HTDAAB is work of greatness that while not necessarily extending U2's legend, at the very least confirms it. <br /> <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is the best Simple Plan CD I've heard yet. It features a wide variety of music, making it a well-rounded album. Their lyrics are relatable and better than those from their first release.
B000002I2M|5.0|This lil' exerpt from a review kinda bugged me. <br /> <br />\\"But since a few of these songs are pretty forgettable, 'L.A. Woman' is an album that is caught between a 4 and a 5 but you have to round up given how good its two best songs end up being.\\" <br /> <br />So... your giving \\"L.A. Woman\\" five stars because of TWO songs? Wha-?? Well, all I can say is, you should've stuck with a Greatest Hits album instead. \\"The Best of the Doors\\" double CD 1985 release, or the recent \\"Legacy: The Absolute Best of the Doors\\" might've pleased you a bit more. <br /> <br />Anywho, on with my review. <br /> <br />By the time the Doors were making this album, Morrison isn't the same Lizard King we all knew back in the Summer of Love and a few years afterward. His voice has no longer the sensuous and mesmerizing vocals that people fell in love with. He's drunker than ever before. He's gained a few pounds (okay, a LOT), so now he's got a belly. And he's grown a beard. Morrison continues to neglect the band, hate John Densmore (who also hates Morrison and, on numerous occasions, wanted to quit the band), and drink excessively. He's suffered a nervous breakdown prior to this release, but now is more focused on writing a book full of poetry. So now it seems Morrison and the Doors are all washed up and ready to fade into rock n'roll heaven. So what's left for them to do? Make one last album while Jim will then take a break and go to Paris... never to return. <br /> <br />On \\"L.A. Woman,\\" the Lizard King is all washed up. His voice is raggy and worn out on most tracks. The group no longer has that psychedelic rock sound of their early days, but rather a blues vibe that was found on their other album \\"Morrison Hotel.\\" But now with the Doors being more blues-oriented and Jimbo's vocals are raggy... it all works on this album. Jim's raggy vocals perfectly match the style of the music and the lyrics that he wrote. You hear that right when you pop this album into your CD player (or tape, or whatever medium) on the first track \\"The Changeling.\\" But unlike the Doors, another guitarist and a bassist (gasp!) helped the band out a bit. The end result: a perfectly executed blues album. <br /> <br />Listening to the first track, you feel Jim's bluesy feelings. \\"I had money... I had none... but I never been so broke that I couldn't get leave town\\" and \\"You gotta see me change!\\" Upon listening to that first track, your in for the listen of the Doors' career. Though Jim is bluesy throughout most of the album, most of the time he's just crackin' jokes, but it's hard to tell at which times he's joking or if he's actually serious. Take some lyrics for example: <br /> <br />\\"Don't you love her madly? Don't you love her as she's walking out the door?... Like she did one thousand times before?\\" <br /> <br />Now... is that just plain humorous or just plain disturbing?  <br /> <br />Most of the group's tracks are upbeat, meaning the listen would be a more uplifting tone. For the first time in a while, it seems as if the group are happy to be working together. <br /> <br />All blues here... except for one track entitled \\"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat).\\" The only track to have the group's original psychedelic rock sound. Here, Morrison gives out some of his most unusual lyrics. At the same time, it also sounds a bit bluesy, but not with Morrison's lyrics and Manzarek blaring his organ once again. <br /> <br />But the jokes end on the final track, \\"Riders on the Storm.\\" The last great track the group ever produced. Morrison's final tale. A tale of a \\"killer on the road.\\" The rain and thundering in the background create such an eerie vision during the first minute or so. Ray's keyboard had never sounded better, which really blooms on this track. The other two members are nearly silent most of the time. Everybody is just listening to what the Lizard King has to say. He tells us how alone we really are in this world... but then he adds, \\"girl you gotta love your man... take him by the hand... make him understand... the world on you depends, our life will never end.\\" Maybe we're all not so much alone if we have a special person to care for. <br /> <br />\\"L.A. Woman\\" is most likely the best album the group has released. I know I said that their self-titled album was my favorite, but \\"L.A. Woman\\" caught me off guard. On this album, Morrison seems more real than ever before. He seemed to have sensed his time was nearly up. So what's more for him to do? Tell every listener his last stories and express more of his feelings, whether it'll be humorous or not. Morrison had money, he loved to see his woman walk out on him, he's been down for a long time, couldn't communicate with his woman, fearing she's alone in a big city, trying to find himself, trying to find a new friend, and ultimately controls everything. Once he gained that control, he finally tells us not one, but two last stories. One about a God, and the other... his last message. Therefore, \\"L.A. Woman\\" is not only my favorite Doors album ever... it is now my all-time favorite album.
0783232039|5.0|This is my favorite Chucky movie ever, I dont know if Seed of Chucky will be better I heard it was good but the not better, but Bride of Chucky is the best, pretty much the same plot as the Child's Play series just that he has a Bride and he goes after a guy and his wife with his Bride.This movie proves that horror and comedy mix together.
B00000IQW3|2.0|One of my favorites as a kid but upon viewing recently I found out that just because you liked something 20 years ago doesn't mean you are going to like it now. Ashame, but that's how it is.<br /><br />The movie has a paper thin plot and almost no character development plus it tries to work overly hard at pulling at the heart-strings.<br /><br />Computer graphics were great for them but are distracting now.<br /><br />If you have a child and they like video games they may like they movie but it is a product of the 80's.<br /><br />My only question is, what happened to the Beatiful Catherine Mary Stewart?
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I love this movie I didnt expect it to be this awesome, Aston Kutcher is like the best in this movie, his best role ever and the plot is kinda confusing u will get it by the end, and my god one the best movies Ive ever seen
B0006399FS|5.0|After making two overly experimental albums that no one wishing to look good for the opposite sex would want cluttering up their living space (ZOOROPA and POP), U2 made an extraordinary comeback with ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND, a wonderful album that returned to the open-heartedness and inspirational lyrics of such early albums as BOY and WAR while adding some of the modern touches that had been more noticeable on their 90s work. The result was an album that was both classic AND modern. With HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB, U2 continue in that vein, proving that their artistic comeback of 2000 was certainly no fluke. This album, if anything, is even more like their 80s work than its predecessor, with virtually no electronics anywhere except for some drum programs. This CD rocks harder than anything the group ever did since WAR, and all of the songs are exceptional. This is one of the first U2 albums to buy, along with BOY, WAR, UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, THE JOSHUA TREE, ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND, and ACHTUNG BABY.
B00068IOWM|5.0|This album is U2's best effort since Achtung Baby was released in 1991. The music has a more organic sound that the band hasn't really demonstrated since their early days on The Unforgettable Fire album. I had heard rumors that this was going to be more hard rock, but that doesn't seem to be their intent. That's not to say they aren't possessed - because Edge is laying down some hard riffs and Bono is just throwing everything he's got at you. But the tone is more delicate, perhaps from the album's direct relationship with the passing of Bono's father. If you love U2, you will love this. Promise. I bought the collector's addition, which had an extra track on the CD, along with a bonus DVD and a book of paintings/writings from the band. The book is a little odd, but I suppose when you're the world's greatest band you are afforded certain liberties. Well worth it.
B00008OLYN|3.0|First off, I love Opeth.  Mikael Akerfeldt is one of my personal heroes.  But this latest cd somewhat let me down.  It was all clean-voice acoustic.  Now don't get me wrong, I think Opeth are the masters of the clean-voice acoustic passage, but these sections are usually still fast-paced and loud enough to enjoy.  But on Damnation, the songs are so slow and soft, they quickly became boring.  \\"Boring\\" is a term that should never be used to describe an Opeth release.  But here, it fits.  I was also discouraged by the short length of the songs and the fact that the songs remain the same throughout their entire duration.  One of Opeth's strongest points was their ability to completely change tempo, rift, atmosphere several time in each song!  Having said all of that, if you are an Opeth fan you should still own this.  Once again, Akerfeldt wrote all of the music and lyrics on the album, and his musical mastery alone is worth the $18.
0316518565|4.0|one question comes up in my mind after reading the book. The OTC trade that leeson did with Spear, Leeds and Kellogg. If Simon Jones(or anybody) was just a litlle bit confused, why dident somebody just make contact with SLK? Then they would have know right away that there was no trade with SLK. Just making this call would have been very simple and would have uncover the true posititon. <br />The fact that Coopers and lybrand,an independed auditor, dident discover the losses is strange. But well acomplished deception by Leeson was probably the explanation (and fraud).
B0000584V3|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite cd's that I have ever heard.  So wondefully well-written, so well-balanced, everything about this cd is perfect.  This album really exhibits Mikael Akerfeldt's musical genius.  The production is top-notch and the instrumentation is, as always, unmatched.  Standout tracks are Leper Affinity, Bleak, Harvest, and the title-track, but of course, all of the other tracks are brilliant to.  A prerequisite to anyone's music collection.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This is one of the best Concert DVD's I've seen. It's almost as good as being at a Journey Concert. The energy that Journey Music generates is amazing. Journey is continuing on the path that they started back in the early 70's ... this band may have a few new faces in the lineup but the sound is better than it has ever been. I highly recommend this DVD, it's the closest thing to being at a live Journey show. Also, it's the easiest way to get a great seat. :)
B00000DHRZ|3.0|Everybody knows The Offspring. Who doesn't remember 'Self Esteem'? But it was just 5 years ago that The Offsping made me love their music. That was all because of my sister who bought 'Pretty fly'. On the B-side, there was the live version of 'All I want'. I loved(and still love) that song. Than 'The kids aren't alright' came out. I immediately bought 'Americana'. Yeah well..I was a little bit disappointed. The only song I constantely listened to was 'The kids aren't alright'. The other songs are just above average. Later, I remembered 'All I want'. I got out and bought 'Ixnay on the hombre' and fell in love with it. So go out and buy Ixnay!

Paul \\" Pee-Wee Herman\\" Reubens provides the voice of the sassy \\"Max\\", the special effects for it's day are quite good in comparison to today's CGI effects and contains an early appearence by Sarah Jessica Rabbit, it's a must See.<br /><br />The DVD is clear as crystal with great sound but no extras at all, well that's alright cause this movie is finally on DVD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bob is an actor who is overseas endorsing a Japanese whisky, forgetting his son's birthday, taking a break from his wife, suffering from severe jet-lag, and lamenting over his career (or current lack thereof).  Bob is lost. <br /> <br />Charlette is a young woman, fresh out of college, recently married, tagging along with her work-aholic photographer husband, who can't sleep and doesn't know what career is right for her.  Charlette is lost. <br /> <br />These two displaced Americans wander the halls and bars of the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, driven by insomnia.  When they meet by chance and begin talking about their lives, an unlikely friendship forms between these two lost souls. <br /> <br />Sophia Coppola's masterpiece Lost In Translation tells the tale of this friendship over the backdrop of Tokyo's amazingly strange and beautiful nightlife.  The light and sound seems to come alive, pulling you in and sets a mood that lasts long after the film has ended. <br /> <br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give such convincing and fluid performances one may wonder if there ever was a script, and if they truly are acting at all. <br /> <br />This is a tale of a friendship that the audience knows cannot last.  It is one of those temporary, beautiful things that you want to go on forever even though they can't.  Questions of \\"What will happen next\\" must just be pushed to aside.  This is the story of a friendship, and nothing more.  As simple as that may seem, Sophia brings the story to the audience with such profound meaning, such satirical humor, with such a poignant relationship.
0783232039|5.0|Set after the events of Child's Play 3, Tiffany ( played by Jennifer Tilly) has been searching 10 years for her fiance Charles Lee Ray and she discovers Chucky ( voiced by Brad Douriff) torned to pieces by the fan from the end of Child's Play 3 in a police evidence despository then is stitched together to be brought back to life. However Chucky decides to also put Tiffany's soul into a doll, they take a ride with a newlywed couple ( Nick Stable and Katherine Heigl) to Hackenshack New Jersey to try to get a special amulet to become human.<br /><br />A worthy entry in the series and is probably the second best to \\"Child's Play 2\\", this is a slight improvement over part 3 with better acting, great special effects, dark humor, John Ritter co-starring, and a twist in the end that leads to the recent \\"Seed of Chucky\\".<br /><br />The DVD is great with terrific picture and good sound, the extras are good such as Trailer, an easter egg if you go to the cast & filmmakers bios, Production notes, Jennifer Tilly's diary on the film, two commentaries and the history of Chucky.
B00000JQFM|3.0|Thank you for reading my review! <br />I am a huge fan of Joe Satrinani, and I have all his albums. <br />It's safe to say that this album lauched Satch's career big time. <br />Nearly everyone knows \\" Always with me\\" \\" Satch Boogie \\" or \\" Surfin with the alien\\" <br />The album does have good songs, but for me, they just don't hold up over time. Maybe some tracks have also been flogged to death, or are oft played at concerts etc. <br />Maybe it's also the commercial edge to this album. <br />And I think maybe, some tracks were just \\"lets see how fast I can play a basic melody\\" ( \\" Crushing Day \\" ) <br />However, all fans should definitely own this as it is an  important piece of work in Joes career. If you have never heard this before, it will give you a few years of listening at a minimum. But for mine, Joe has far more impressive albums around, that sustain the listening pleasure. <br />I like the second half much better than the first five tracks, which I do like, but find myself often skipping these days. <br />The highlights on the album for me are \\" Circles \\", \\" Midnight \\" and the brilliant \\" Echo\\"- the last and best track on the album for me. <br />For mine \\" Crystal Planet\\" , \\" The Extremist \\" \\" Flying in a Blue Dream\\" or even \\" Engines of Creation\\" are far better albums, and better for a first try if you are new to Joes Guitar music. <br />Please enjoy them all though! <br />Thanks for reading my review <br /> <br /> <br />
0440214041|3.0|Someone assassinates two Supreme Court justices (the assassin is a burned out terrorist named Khamel, but the powers that be are baffled.  They have no clues.   <br /> <br />Darby Shaw spends a few days in the law library and figures out who wanted the hit, in order to stack the Supreme Court.  This puts her in jeopardy, and people keep getting murdered around her. <br /> <br />Scary?  Well, it might have been, but somehow, we know (I knew) that Darby was going to make it in the end and the \\"bad guys\\" were going to have their comeuppance.  That was never in doubt. <br /> <br />So, not so scary. <br /> <br />What was interesting was Grisham's description of the law firms, and the lawyers, in Washington, D.C.  This was eye-opening, the numbers, the morals, and the career ladder that such people follow.   <br /> <br />What was interesting, but stupid, was the President.  It's hard to imagine a President this stupid, but I wonder was the model Mr. Ron?  And this golfer President turns the real business of running the nation over to a young smoothy by the name of Fletcher Coal, who is one of the \\"bad guys,\\" in a way, but he has some good traits, too: He can work incessantly and seems to be pretty intelligent.  He just lacks, what, heart? <br /> <br />I've read better books by Grisham.  There is a story here, but not a page-turning story.  Just kind of, \\"Okay, who's going to fail to assassinate Darby this time?\\"   <br /> <br />I didn't see the movie, but the book seemed to be tailor-made for Hollywood, also, another down-side (compare Grisham's Bleachers, a more recent effort, which does not seem to be targeted so prominently toward a movie script).   <br /> <br />Diximus.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 hasn't sounded this good or natural since \\"Joshua Tree\\". \\"Achtung Baby\\" comes close, but \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\", besides scoring one of the most impressive displays of publicity I've seen in a long time for an album (think free NYC concert, iPod commercial, U2 iPod, The Leak, etc.), is solid in all fronts. The lyrics have grown every bit as much as the music, and they come from a \\"different\\" place too, many of them having been inspired by the passing of Bono's father.<br /><br />Joined by longtime collaborators Eno, Lanois, Flood and Lillywhite, production legend Chris Thomas (mixed Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and produced INXS' \\"Kick\\"), Nellee Hopper (think BJork, Madonna, Massive Attack) and Jacknife Lee, the Dublin-based foursome strikes a solid musical punch with this album. From the moment \\"Vertigo\\" hit the airwaves along with its insanely brilliant video, it was obvious that the album coming was not going to dissapoint. After the release, it is clear that U2 is at the top of their game.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" maintains the power of the opening track, with a U2 sound that can make you weep of emotion, leading into track after track that don't dismay until well after the album is over... and you play it again, and again. Sure, I am a U2 fan. And this album only confirms my respect and admiration for their work, in the studio and outside of it, as spokespersons for the world's most worthy causes.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|You know ya'll can't go no wrong on Alicia. 'Cause she's has a wonderful talent to give us since we heard her from the beginning. I think the most thing about her is she's has great talent, a beautiful voice, and most definitely I love to work with in the future, Like to me, I'm 19 years old 'bout to be 20 on the same month when she's dropped her album. Yeah I used to think Alicia was all cool and stuff, But now I'm not, 'Cause I'm a big fan to her music and look forward for her putting albums in the future. First of all, I love the way that she put out that record \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" which talks about what if no one new her by any chance or have never even notice her name before since she's been out. And especially I like favorites on the album including Karma (which is doin' ok on the radio airwaves and all of that), Heartburn which is truly a good one, then I like If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By which features the sample from Biggie's \\"Warning\\" (Know ya'll heard of him before, it's off his album \\"Ready to Die\\") and plus many more favorites like If I Ain't Got You, Diary (a pretty good slow jam), etc.    Now lemme say this, I've first been a fan to her since she put out her first CD which I love entitled \\"Songs In A Minor\\". The problem is nobody believe in that record 'cause it has no feel to it at all. I don't understand why ya'll be hatin and/or feelin' this record. 'cause that may her a star when she walk home with 5 Grammys. I've never had a problem listen to the entire album she put on that year. Anyway, long period short, There a lot of songs I don't dislike but one song I would live without is \\"So Simple\\" 'cause I wasn't feeling any melody of it or something that wasn't my fav. Wish it'll need more work on it.     Well I'm proud for what she did at the top and 'preciate the kind of success she's receive. I have recently wrote her a letter saying that I'm her biggest fan and will always support her long as she's don't mess up or not. Simple. Anyway, Goodjob Alicia, Keep up the good work, Look forward of hearing from you one day when u put out another album.    I give it 2 thumbs up 4 that.
0609610570|4.0|Bossidy's Execution was one of five books assigned for a seminary leadership course. Yes, churches have come to realize that intelligent management practices are applicable to religious organizations. <br /> <br />The author's basic premise is that the old Leadership vs. Manager dichotomy is a false one. Visionary leaders who are \\"hands off\\" set their organizations up for failure. The tendency of departments is to promote their own agendas and cover their weaknesses. Those who oversee them must know enough about the people and activities under their charge to catch when things are going wrong. Further, true leaders need to be involve themselves in the details enough that they are setting the agenda, rather than allowing components of the organization to set disparate ones. <br /> <br />Proper execution is the current business buzz and trend. Yet, there is validity to the notion that leaders need to direct key details as well as the big vision. <br /> <br />Bottom-line: Execution was clearly geared for the business world. Yet the basic argument that leaders must dream dreams, but also direct the primary details, is important. For us non-business leaders, this may not be an enjoyable read. We overlook the author's warnings at our own peril, however. Bossidy offers us a leadership set of side and rearview mirrors--allowing us to see our blind spots.
0783225547|5.0|Excellent love stories are hard to find on film. <br /> This is one of the excellent ones.  <br />By-passing any criticism this one of the top love stories with the back-drop of the action of the volcano. <br />Excellent acting by all even the children - and that dog. <br />Again, one of the few men that can portray emotion with out have to act it out - gentleness, tenderness, emotion. <br />Action is great - whew! I could even smell the sulphur. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --- definitely a keeper!
B0006399FS|3.0|For starters: For all you U2 fans who love this album....the people dissing it aren't dissing it to bother you nor are they being ignorant. Mostly they are people like myself who LOVE U2, yet HATE their recent music.<br /><br />I hated ATYCLB. In the years since I have waited patiently for this band to reveal that album to be a fluke. I had loved every album up til then. I thought their entire output in the 90's was their best work. But since 2000 this band has been dying.<br /><br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, like ATYCLB, is soft, predictable, boring and OLD sounding. By old I don't mean Joshua Tree, I mean OLD MEN making tired, safe and adult-radio friendly songs. They have officially joined Rod Stewart and Elton John-Land<br /><br />The first single, Vertigo is actually the only thing that rocks on this CD, proving that it was specifically crafted to be the face of this album and sell copies to and draw in the youth market, fooling them into buying something that sounds mostly like Bono's croaking voice meandering around amongst 4 minute chunks of cliche classic Edge guitar solos. Unfortunately, none of this is very memorable or lively. Also for the first time Larry and Adam are coasting on fumes, playing nothing interesting and pushing zero envelopes.<br /><br />Sure, many of the choruses are catchy, but they are also very, very simple. Often just repeating a couple words over and over. Something which even the worst bands can manage to come up with. There are also several beautiful little guitar parts scattered about, but they strike my ears as contrived to sound like the good old days.<br /><br />Some of the double vocals, such as the verses in All Because of You are welcome, hearkening back to the early and mid-90's. And I was pleasently surprised that regardless of how croaky Bono sounds, his voice is stronger than it has been for a few years.<br /><br />I want to love this CD. I have sat around waiting for it for weeks, months and years, but after hearing it several times, I hear only a few songs that I have the desire to listen to again.  Most notably A Man and a Woman (my favorite song here, reminding me of Party Girl slightly in parts), and City of Blinding Lights, although neither of these can even TOUCH Ground Beneath Her Feet, Please, Stay, Acrobat or any of the other songs this band was once capable of.<br /><br />I will stand by them, to an extent, forever. I was raised on this band and their songs, I just wish they weren't growing older and losing their creativity and energy. Maybe in four more years they'll make a better album. That's what I thought in 2000, but my wishful thinking was shattered, so I doubt that in 2008 (when they are pushing 50) any of their songs will be anything but even more meandering and more geriatric.<br /><br />Bottom line - After ATYCLB (and maybe October) this might be their least-great record.<br /><br />and Bono...your stage presence is making me sick...s that I have the desire to listen to again.

B00005U11Z|5.0|This DVD is such fun to watch and listen to.  Its 5.1 Surround Sound audio puts you in the center of the action.  Since 1973 when Journey first took the stage there have been many personal changes and only this group gets better as time goes on. The two latest members Steve Augeri on vocals and Deen Castronovo on drums do not need to prove why they are in this band.  Regardless of what you have read Steve Augeri is not a Steve Perry impersonator.  He is the real deal and any comparison to Mr. Perry is a complement.  Only Deen Castronovo could step in for Steve Smith.  You would think that Deen has always been a part of this band.  He fits in like a glove.  Not only will you be impressed with his drumming you'll have to catch Journey out on tour to see why this band is better than they have ever been.  Deen's lead vocals out on tour will surprise you.  Just close your eyes and you're back in time.  Ross, Jon and Neal still continue to show the world why the Journey still continues.  Buy this DVD and get lost in the music.  Sing along with the old songs and learn some new ones.  When you're ready for more, catch them live.  Tour information can be found at [...] along with so much more.  Journey on! <br />

B0002VKZL6|4.0|Where would we be without Mark Knopfler's distinctive brand of folky-rock storytelling?  Don't bother worrying about it -- we have him, and now fans have another reason to give thanks:  \\"Shangri-La.\\"    It's important to note that Mark's guitar hand was nearly silenced, approximately a year ago, after a motorcycle accident.  He's okay, though, and the music goes on.  Worries remain about how his playing might have been affected -- there are few, if any, six-string pyrotechnics heard on \\"Shangri-La.\\" But since Knopfler plans a full tour to support it all seems well.    Unlike Knopfler's three previous CDs, \\"Shangri-La\\" generally stays in the same laid-back groove.  I'm not sure this is by design -- Knopfler seemed to make much of the fact that he recorded the CD at a studio on the California coastline -- or happenstance.  No Straits-like fireworks to be found here, and no folky ones circa \\"Ragpicker's Dream,\\" either.    In fact, there are moments on \\"Shangri-La\\" that made me wonder whether Knopfler was attempting to channel Chris Isaak.  Nevertheless, the songs are consistently good.  Here are some quick highlights:      \\"Boom Like That\\" is the only song I know of about corporate history -- in this case, Ray Kroc and the birth of McDonald's.  It's the first single from the disc and the one with the most recognizable hook.    \\"5:15 AM\\" is Knopfler at his best:  mellow start, interesting story, and solid climax.  \\"Our Shangri-La\\" and \\"Everybody Pays\\" are the Knopfler-as-Isaak tracks and stand out as the nicest on the disc.        \\"Postcards From Paraguay\\" is an instant latin beat classic. \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance\\" is another good example of Knopfler's wry humor.      Highly recommeded -- great for long drives, cocktail parties, or sitting around with a good book.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is a great cd, but it should have been a 2 cd set because it doesn't have some of there most famous songs!! such as: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Strawberry Fields Forever, Here comes the Sun, Taxman, and more.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I remember buying 'October' in 1982 on the strength of 'Gloria' and have had this band in my life ever since. Its a cliche but they have been the soundtrack to so much in my life. As such the release of a new U2 album is something I always anticipate and reflect on. The child is here now and oh what a healthy baby it is! <br /> <br />In an interview last week Bono said the band have gone back to the start and have been listening to'Boy' along with The Buzzcocks, The Ramones and whatever else populated their minds in 1978 when they formed. There are moments in this album when riffs and vocals are plucked from Boy and a youthful punkish Bono flashes in my mind's eye.  It is wonderful to hear melody rich relevant guitar based rock bursting through the R&B and Rap polluted landscape of other contempory music - this album will sell in the millions and it will win Grammys. There is nothing else out there and U2 as the last great band of the 20th century are now left like great sharks in a goldfish pond - shimmering and unreal in their unmatched quality and sound. <br /> <br />So what about the album? Vertigo opens the bidding like a revamped 'Elevation' pounding a hole in your ears with a timeless and relentless new riff. \\"Hello hello\\" Bono sings as if to announce his return - and you had better listen up because it starts to cook from here on. <br /> <br />'Miracle Drug' is majestic and if you know the story of Christopher Nolan (the Irish quadreplegic writer about whom it written along with a concurrent nod to the AIDS crisis in Africa) the lyrics infect your blood until you weep.  <br /> <br />The stand out track - and Grammy record of the year 2005 baring any surprises is 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own'. Written about Bono's father who passed away in 2001, the song hit me as a reminder. A reminder to savour the time left with those we love, even if we dont always see eye to eye. The lyric 'and its you when I dont pick up the phone' is elegant and sad. The whole song builds to a sort of catharthis point when Bono cries \\"You're the reason why the opera is in me\\". As in 'One' the lyric and music are inseperable and song perfection is achieved. <br /> <br />Phew. Three tracks in and it is a classic album in the making. The stand out tracks from here are - well they are all superb - but 'A Man and a Woman' struts a soulful match to the Rolling Stones' 'Waiting on a Friend'. Its a sitting on a New York stoop song that is unique for its pop structure and for Bono's voice here which takes on a new richness when he sings \\"little sister\\". It is new for the band and works. <br /> <br />'Crumbs From Your Table'needs to be cranked up to hear a classic driving Edge riff with pounding drum and bass from Adam and Larry as the song starts. There is a meesage here kids though: \\"Where you live should not decide whether you live or die\\" and Bono's wider campaigns work their way into the album again.  <br /> <br />'One Step Closer' starts with luscious Daniel Lanois strings and builds in a linear fashion like 'Bad'. Its old classic U2 again with a strong nod to the ambient sound of 'The Unforgettable Fire' and 'Joshua Tree'.  <br /> <br />'Original of the Species' bursts open with a string backing straight off 'The White Album' - no surprise with Chris Thomas on the team. After about 20 listens its this track which I find myself whistling the most. Its got single written all over it and Edge has never sounded better. <br /> <br />If you like U2 you dont need a reveiw to tell you to buy the album. If you are a borderline fan - maybe you did not 'get' Pop or Zooropa (Popmart for me was genius)and prefer a more direct sound then U2 circa 1980 is back. Back that is with a production that glistens and melodies that will fill arenas everywhere next year. How this album will get up and walk as a visual production on tour is the next thing to look forward to but in the mean time buy this collection of work by a true artist and let it grow into your life. When you look back on November 2004 it will be there in your memory like a scent.
B0006399FS|5.0|Their best studio album behind Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.  That should say it all.
B0006399FS|4.0|Classic 2, if you're into that... Which I most definitely am.
B0000640VN|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I think the director does a great job making a 50's kind of Romantic Comedy that works well, keeping in mind that it is a fantasy, so it shouldn't be scrutinized too closely. The actors all work well together, and fit into the movie well. They all enhance each others rolls. Meg Ryan does a good job as usual in this kind of plot. Hugh Jackman pulls off Leopold very well.
B000002B35|3.0|Forget the three stars shown -- I voted five, but Amazon's website goofed.  This one's a five, believe me!    Somehow, I skipped over Pink Floyd while getting older and never really noticed them.  A longing for some good British band music led me to give Pulse a shot and boy was I surprised.  I'd always thought their songs that I heard on pop radio were sort of 'down' because of the lyrics.  Yes, there are negative themes here, but there are an equal number of passages where the minor keys are resolved into beautiful, shining majors.  Gilmour is a stupendous, versatile guitar player.  I have to rate him as one of the best lead guitarists I've ever heard -- intelligent work that doesn't rely on cliches that are repeated over and over (Ever take a close listen to Clapton, even going back to the original Layla?  I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about him.  He's smooth, but not really very inventive -- and he plays off pitch, as well!).  These two CD's will satisfy anyone thirsting for guitar elevated to an art form.    At first I was disappointed because Gilmour's voice on these CD's doesn't sound like I was expecting.  It's not as clear as the studio versions of these songs that were recorded 25 years ago.  But after listening several times, I actually like his mature voice better.  It has a nice quality to it.    What amazes me is that these three remaining Floyds have played these songs live countless times.  But there is not even a hint of jadedness here.  They really put everything they had into the music and that's impressive.  The recordings are superb for live recordings.    I could go on -- great backup vocals, great bass, neat interchanges between the fans and the band.  The version of \\"Money\\" on this album is just really great.  It makes the original studio version sound very canned.  This one breathes with interesting parts that'll have the darned thing going through your head over and over and over again.    If you're even half interested in PinkFloyd, you won't be sorry with this purchase.
B00003CWOL|3.0|While sporting excellent comic acting and a clever story, Dogma is unfulfilling as a movie that is supposed to carry a message. <br /> <br />Fellow reviewers have remarked that Dogma explores both serious theological issues and complex social issues facing the Church and organized religion today. A comic film with this aim has much potential. <br /> <br />In order to have a coherent message, however, such a film must have some elements of truth in what it is commenting on. The way in which Dogma explores issues demonstrates a weak understanding of actual theology or social issues. Apparently clever references to transubstantiation and indulgences actually have little basis in what those doctrines actually teach (or even in the ways in which people commonly tend to misinterpret them). Even questions of God's sex and Jesus' race both misrepresent what the Church actually teaches and fail to cover any new ground. The Church actually affirms that God has no gender (admittedly, inclusive language during the liturgy would be nice), and there's been little doubt about Jesus' race. The images in our mind of him as Anglo-Saxon is the product of our art, and how this portrayal effects our conception of Jesus is something worth reflecting about.  <br /> <br />But Dogma fumbles this opportunity. There are indeed serious issues facing the Church and organized religion, and we definitely need to discuss (and poke fun at) these issues more, but Dogma's misrepresentation comes off more as a disorganized and uninformed rant against organized religion than a serious satire, which is how it seemed to be marketed. <br /> <br />That being said, this film is fun to watch for entertainment value. Alan Rickman is indeed hilarious. The movie has good quotable lines and memorable comic moments. <br /> <br />When you watch Dogma, don't expect an informed comic exploration on theological or social issues. Instead, watch it for laughter value.
B0006284JQ|4.0|Britney is a great artist with great videos and great physical talents. She does have a decent voice that is pleasant to the ear...but her songs have started going downhill from In The Zone. In the Zone was her worst album because of the songs \\"early mornin'\\", \\"the hook up\\" and \\"brave new girl\\". Now on the Greatest Hits album, she has continued her path of having some below average songs such as \\"do somethin'\\" and \\"i've just begun having my fun\\". My prerogative was ok at first but then i quickly got tired of it and the video. She has been going downhill for awhile and i am already awaiting her next album. I have been quick to buy all of her albums in the past, but now i'm not so sure. I still like her though, but she's gotta come up with some better material and i hope she gets some great ballads like \\"don't let me be the last to know\\" or \\"from the bottom of my broken heart\\". I guess she's tryin out some r&b and some more techno-like songs, but it ain't workin for me. PLZ get some better songs BRITNEY!!!
0783240287|4.0|I see the family values types are caught in a bind.  A sexed up children's show based on the bible.  They're tying themselves in knots at Netflix trying to get themselves out of that one.  I'm an Atheist and I loved it, bible, sex or no.  I did not buy this DVD, I rented it.  Pharaoh's song was rewritten (by ALW himself? his production company put out the flick, so I suppose so), and I infinitely preferred the original.  And they hoked up the country tune \\"One Less Angel in Heaven\\" to the point that the melody was lost.  Yuk!  These 2 flaws will keep me from buying it.  But one time through, it was wonderful.  Unlike Evita, it followed the original perfectly, the music is divine, written (1st show as everyone in the know likes to point out) before Lloyd Webber lost his miraculous gift for melody.  And boy did this show have melody.  I recommend it for young, old, Jew or Heathen.  Christians can watch too.  It had color, life, clever lyrics (rife with false rhymes, Rice was no Larry Hart), and a couple of knock-outs in the leads, the narrator and Joseph.  They were wonderful (everybody else was good too, only nobody else had much to do).  And Donny Osmond was sexy and beautiful in the loin cloth (underpants) he wore through the last 2/3 of the show!
B0006399FS|1.0|Is very clear many reviews here are posted in order to save the U2's new album, in a desperate attempt to elevate the mediocrity and uninspired music presented on this new LP. Declarations like \\"is the best ever U2 album !!!\\" are illusive and silly. Music itself is very annoying, as well album concept intended for easy fans. This album is really lame. By the way don't think I hate U2, NO WAY, I love U2, but I love the REAL U2, the avant-garde U2, not this commercial and safe one !!.  I think is time to open eyes and see what's evident: U2 has no wish to change their music, has no wish to improve theirselves, has no wish to wake up and try to make a worthy effort. The worst thing is how so many fans can be deceived and be used with any album, it does not matter what how bad is, the adoration and the idolatry are immediate and unconditional. <br />Probably after my post, you'll find at least 10 reviews of this album saying \\"Is awesome, the best one since Acthung Baby, U2 is back, etc\\". A shame, a real shame. That's exactly U2 wants now, easy fans to make money without effort. U2 is dead. I attended to several concerts between 1989 and 1993...those times are gone, now with this \\"bomb\\" U2 will reach another 10 million copies and 7 or 8 grammy, because the fans don't realize their trick is to put some make up to All That You Can't Live Behind, to use more distorded guitars and that's all...10 milion copies wordwide. U2 art is sinking.
B0006399FS|1.0|I must say with the title of the album, \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\", and a crushing song like Vertigo, how could this album suck, you are wondering.  I must say U2 is one of hard rocks most talented bands, but \\"hard rock\\" has nothing to this album.  When I heard Vertigo, I was blown away at the bass playing and Edge's heavy melody that leaves you in awww after hearing it.  When I got the album weeks before it was due, I decided to never listen to it again.  U2 is one of my favorite bands, and they play hard like hard is meant to be played.  This album is like a mix of 5 for Fighting and \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000)\\".  I wish this had a Vertigo or Elevation ring to it.  On the U2 site, it said our first real rock album.  In return, its their first real pop album, a peice of sh*t.  I was dissapointed and still am about this release and wish U2 would record another album soon, a rock album, to compincate for this pile of puke.  Otherwise, U2 is an awsome band and is definately a band that is not nearly ready to end their career.  Don't turn pop on us, the ones who buy your music.  [...]
B0006399FS|1.0|Ok waiting is over, so the truth comes out. No more empty promises, no more \\"best album\\" words, no more marketing. Now is time for the truth. And the truth is at least 50% of fans don't like this new album, simply as that. First of all, this isn't a ROCK album at all. Only 25% ( 3 songs ) are pure Rock. The rest contains middle-tempo songs or ballads. I think U2 is an old fashioned band, I mean, they live with the smashes they had in the past. U2 is a lazy famous band now, and they know they don't have to work hard for success, and that's clear with this below average album.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a beautiful story, and the love these two have is incredible.  Ryan Gosling steals the film - his acting is impeccable.  However, Rachel McAdmas is wonderful, and they chemistry they have is enigmatic.  To think that a man could love a woman so much...it's magical.  You have to see this movie.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I decided to write here an unusual sort of review because of what happened to me related to this CD. <br /> <br />I usually go to local Barnes & Noble with a laptop to work while having a drink. Sometimes I wear earphones to enjoy the music I bring, sometimes I listen to the store's ambient music, which happens to be very nice most of the time. <br /> <br />One of those days I'm there working, and I realize they are playing a very nice warm voice, a female singer that I can't recognize, singing something Jazzy with the word \\"Lonesome\\" in the lyrics.  I didn't pay much attention to the lyrics but just the warm and smooth sweet voice, really very pleasant, so smoothly flowing.  The style and voice sounded somewhat similar to, or reminded me of Tierney Sutton, but this was a bit warmer and softer, and it wasn't Tierney for sure.  Also somewhat resembling Billie Holiday, but not her either for sure.  Neither she was Jacqui Naylor, who can also sound a bit like Holiday, but her voice I can recognize in a millisecond. Anyway, I went back to working on the laptop while listening to this magnificent voice in the background. Unfortunately I didn't worry about asking what CD they were playing or what the singer was... Very unfortunately. <br /> <br />Couple of days later I'm listening to music at night at home, and I suddenly feel this craving in my ear for that sweet voice singing that particular song. That happens to me frequently, and this one was a particularly powerful craving. But alas! This time I had no true idea who the singer was. In fact, I had very little hope on how to find who she was. <br /> <br />First I started a search for lyrics with the word \\"lonesome\\", couldn't find anything with lyrics that read like that song. I started to think that probably I had misheard the word. (Take into account, I'm not a native English speaker, and also I really didn't pay detailed attention to the lyrics when hearing her voice in the bookstore. To me I remembered something like \\"lonesome anymore\\" in the song, but wasn't sure). In any case, the lyrics search proved unsuccessful. <br /> <br />Went to Amazon and started searching for Jazz singers to sample voices I'm not familiar with, and zero results too. I realize I was buried into quite a problem of information retrieval: to try to find a voice you heard, but you don't know the singer's name, or the song's title, nor even the lyrics, no CD cover. Just (hopefully) one correct word in the lyrics, \\"lonesome\\", and that voice in your memory... <br /> <br />Went to the local B&N the next day and started a systematic search through the whole Jazz racks of CD's trying all female singer's CD's in the sampling stations where you can hear them with headphones, but didn't find the voice.  Because of this search I ended up discovering Jane Monheit, which I also liked a lot, and got her latest CD. But still, the mysterious voice I was looking for was out of my grasp. <br /> <br />Believe it or not, this search lasted more than two months, and through all that time, I wasn't lucky enough to have that song on the radio, or again on the ambient music of B&N or any other bookstore, or anywhere that I could ask what was being played. <br /> <br />Just yesterday I was browsing Amazon.com and clicked on one of those recommendations they give you. I wasn't even thinking about my \\"voice search\\" at the moment, when I realize one of the songs in the CD was entitled \\"You're gonna make me lonesome when you go\\"... Suddenly my entire consciousness woke up and tunneled onto every letter on that sentence. It sounded an aweful lot exactly like what I think the song I remembered said. I clicked on the \\"Listen\\" link, and oh goodness gracious what a miracle... there she was!!!!!!!!!.... <br /> <br />It was this very CD you are reading reviews about, \\"Careless Love\\", by Madeleine Peyroux, and again the song's title \\"You're gonna make me lonesome when you go\\".  My highest recommendations to this gorgeous and pleasant voiceand singing. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Which is just like the plot - there isn't one.  If you're into sarcastic, dry wit, this is a movie for you.  I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing it, but my friend REALLY wanted to.  I'm SO glad I did.  It's one of the best movies I saw this year.  And it's definitely going to become a cult classic - I think it was as soon as it was released.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|It is great after almost 20 years to have this historic event on DVD. The quality is great for the technolgy at the time. As like many other people I am disappointed that alot of footage was left out. I am sure some footage was lost but don't buy for one minute the explanation on the DVD that nothing was saved. In 1995 on the 10th anniversary of the event VH-1 showed a special packed with highlights. Led Zeppelin not being on is another lame excuse from the band. If they are so concerned about their image why do they allow their classic \\"Rock and Roll\\" to sell cars. Expect another DVD with more footage in the near future which of course I will buy on the first day it comes out like I did for this. In the meantime buy this one and enjoy. By the way the volume is loud as hell , so Crank it Up!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This CD is great.. I have loved it so much.. I had to run out and buy it the night after the CMA's, mainly for the \\"Party for Two\\" with Billy Currington.. Matter of fact I even had to hunt down his CD too, because I loved hearing his voice..  This CD is a MUST buy for a country fans collection.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|What is facinating about McNamara is not that he is a saint nor that he is a devil but that he is only a human. All humans make mistakes but because McNamara was in a position of such great power the repercusstions of the mistakes led to the deaths of tens of thousands of inoccent lives.<br /><br />This is perhaps the reason for the pervaiding aura of sadness McNamara conveys in this film. It also accounts for his inibility to connect events in his life to those around him. He can understand the problem with fire bombing civilian targets in Japan but cannot fathom his own part in it.<br /><br />This is a facinating look into what happens when good men do bad things.
B00003CXDD|3.0|This film's makers got a little too happy with the special effects at the expense of actually telling a story.  More character development and less loose threads would have made this movie five stars, in spite of the overuse of every fairy tale archetype ever known. <br /> <br />I DID like the way the little-people villagers were portrayed as real, three-dimensional people.  Willow's wife was particularly good, an accomplished actress.  Willow being the central character of the movie, should have been given more texture.  After schlepping the hunted infant all over kingdom come, I was absolutely poleaxed that he hung back at the final scene.  I thought of several reasons why he might have done that, but none were given or even really hinted at.  Also, I don't know why the minor subplot of Willow's losing his farm was introduced, and then utterly ignored. <br /> <br />Val Kilmer's character could have done with more screen time, as Madmartigan added needed balance and flavor to the narrative.  I got the impression that some footage was cut (to prevent the movie from being even longer than it was?)  It would also have been nice to have at least a little backstory as to how he knew the blonde, bearded warrior (Erik?) that later joins forces to help defeat the evil queen's army.  More lost footage, I guess. <br /> <br />Joanne Whalley's character, Sorsha, was the most woefully treated. She is delightfully nasty as the evil Queen's warrior daughter, but has no shades of anything else in her character until she decides that her attraction to Madmartigan is more important.  (Well, okay, it IS Val Kilmer, but...)  She needed a good 10 minutes more screen time to make that transition believable. <br /> <br />The brownies (French accents, yet!) were absolutely hilarious, I loved them.  Tres Monty Python. <br /> <br />
B0000UJL96|5.0|The movie deals with a intersting concept, what happens when you enemys are no longer your enemys. This film was made shortly before the end of the cold war and this is reflected in the film.<br /><br />The large powerful Klingon Empire is waning in strangth after the explotion of the moon Praxis (it's main source of power). It opens a diplomatic channel to its old arch enemy the United Federation of Planits.<br /><br />Kirk faces a delemma, the Enerprise is sent to escort the Klingon diplomat, Gorcon, to Earth for peace talks. Kirk hates Klingons, they killed his son in Star Trek III. Kirk is trying to cope with his long standing distrust of his enemys when Gorcon is assasinated, Kirk is blamed, an Spock must solve the mystery of who the real killer is before the chance for intergalactic peace has ended.<br /><br />A excellent final entry into the original movies.
B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam did not sanctify this collection but Sony/Epic did.  However, the sound alone is amazingly clean and fresh on the Ten recordings. I can't wait until Ten is released as a 'Deluxe Edition' or released cleaned up and remixed. The effects are cleaned off of Once, Alive, Even Flow, and Black and allows you to hear them for what they were suppose to sound like. State of Love and Trust is remixed as well and sounds f**king amazing. Buy this collection for the better sound of the overall songs and just for look of the band in its prime and beyond.  Awesome!
B00005JLRT|1.0|Star Trek has long been knowen for it's interesting complex plots, it's memerable characters, and huminist subtext.<br /><br />This movie throws them all out for contrived soap opera, excessive special effects, and action for the sake of action. Not worth any Star Trek fans time.
0930289234|5.0|This book is so incredibly brilliant, my words alone can't do it even a fraction of the justice it deserves. A graphic novel that changed the way we think about comics, written by transcendent literary genius Alan Moore, Watchmen offers a look at superheroes as they would appear in real life. Driven only by enthusiasm and determination, without the benefit of superpowers (except for Dr. Manhattan, the science-born hero), these heroes live in the US of an alternate Earth, where they have fought through the 20th century, meeting with public support, distrust and sometimes hatred. These heroes are more realistic versions of traditional superhero archetypes, bearing the faults and shortcomings of rational behavior and honest human nature. For instance, the crusading vigilante (Rorschach) is a mentally-disturbed murderer, the all-powerful science-born hero (the aforementioned Dr. Manhattan) is so all-powerful he lacks concern for the world around him, and the technological genius inventor (Nite Owl, my personal favorite) is out of shape and overly dependent on his gadgets. This alternate world is equally different and unusual, history having been changed by the superheroes: Richard Nixon is still President in 1985, the US won the Vietnam War easily and World War III looms on the horizon.<br /><br />The story begins with the mysterious death of nasty, thuggish government-agent hero, the Comedian. All the superheroes have recently been forced into retirement by a government order due to public pressure (another clever example of how superheroes & reality don't mix well), and no one is able to fully investigate. However, as tension mounts and more heroes are targeted, the remaining superheroes are drawn out of retirement to solve the mystery and unravel a plan that will... well, I won't spoil it.<br /><br />The really great thing about this book is that it's impossible to predict accurately what comes next. Even the most observant reader or brilliant detective won't be ableto guess the ending (and that's a fact). And trust me, you'll like it that way! You will also love how the story looks at ordinary civilians as well as superheroes. In this way, the reader is kept abreast of the opinions, anxieties and issues of the everyday people. In fact, some of the most interesting characters are these cameo-appearance civilians: the editor of the \\"New Frontiersman\\", the boy who's always reading comics and the prison psychologist, among others.<br /><br />I can't say anymore without giving away the entire plot (if I haven't already) except to praise this book to the skies once more. Watchmen is truly one of a kind, the greatest testament in existence to Alan Moore's genius (and that's saying a lot!). Its every page is richly layered with poetic text, insightful, thought-provoking content and cleverly hidden metaphoric messages, complemented by superb artwork. In short, it is impeccable, brilliant and nothing short of revolutionary. If you consider yourself a comic book fan, or a literary gourmet of any kind, read this book. Read Watchmen.
B000000WCA|5.0|the spice girls were something else... they were not the best singers, the best dancers, or even the best actors... but these girls had something that most artist to date lack.... INDIVIDUALITY!!! that is the key to having a successful musical act...that is why they caught on so quickly... each one had their own style and every1 had their fav (mine was POSH cause she was so damn hot) <br /> <br />anyways this is the debut of the 90s.  the whole LP rocked (but their second effort SPICEWORLD was their best)... hands down, 'say you'll be there' is the best track on the album... it has spunk, meaning, and has posh's first solo on the record...every1 sang their butt off on that song... i love the beat...the video was great with their own superhero look... <br /> <br />'2 become 1','love thing' 'naked', 'wannabe', 'mama', and 'who do you think you are&#62;?' are classics.  <br /> <br />the worst song on the album is probably 'last time lover'... the song is kind of dreary... but every1 has their lacklusters... <br /> <br />this album is great and the spice girls will be in pop culture history until the end of time... so you haters go somewhere... these girls are here to stay...
0393035158|2.0|This book joins a line of fatalistic and simplistic accounts of the human condition that started with Francis Fukuyama's \\"The End of History.\\" We subsequently endured John Horgan's book \\"The End of Science\\" and now we have the \\"The End of Faith.\\" While invocations to critical reasoning are welcome, we need to be far more nuanced about understanding religion before incriminating theologies and tenets with blanket accusations. Rational thought on its own is not enough to save us from pugnacity. Atomic bombs and nerve agents were not developed by theologians but by ostensibly rational scientists. That does not mean we dump science - similarly misinterpretation of religious doctrine should not mean that we dump religion. This book is throwing out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. What is most disturbing is the arrogance that the book exudes about the believers as if there is a mass-neurosis in the world of the faithful. This reminds me of Carl Sagan's famous novel Contact (later made into a movie as well) in which the protagonist is asked in a congressional hearing if she thinks that 90% of the world are delusional because they have transcendental beliefs?  Even if one is not convinced with the veracity of religion, from a purely practical point of view it is unrealistic to think that religion will simply slip into oblivion. There is a need for faith in human societies -- even if we relegate it to a Darwinian survival mechanism. Such mechanisms are very real and have meaning and value. In a recent radio interview the author of this book, mentioned that some societies such as Sweden are moving away from Faith - but it is not clear that they are improving their conditions as a result. Sweden also has one of the highest suicide rates per capita in the world. While there may  be many other causes for this, we should not dismiss the value of religion as an important means of social sustenance. Research by social psycholopgists has repeatedly shown that religion helps people to cope with adversity. Admitting that we do not understand everthing about the universe is not insecurity or delusion but a mark of our humble humanity. It does not have to negate science or rationality either. Religious fervor is like any source of power - with negative and positive consequences in the hands of the practitioner.  The productive conversation that we need is how to channelize that fervor into constructive action rather than dismissing it as fiction.eople to cope with adversity.

I give this DVD 5 stars and I'd give it 10 if I could!!!  Highly recommended by this Journey FAN!!!! <br /> <br />Val
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|An exceptional box set with excellent packaging and reasonable song choices, but the target audience for this monster of a set is not casual fans. They will buy the greatest hits compilations &#34;HIStory&#34; or &#34;Number 1's&#34; and be content. This box set should have been designed for the loyal fans who have stuck by Michael -- the ones who already own all the hits and regular albums -- and been loaded with rarities, b-sides, hard-to-find songs and live material alongside a full line-up of his greatest hits (solo and with the Jackson 5/Jacksons). Instead, it is a little short on rarities and is missing some key Jackson 5 hit singles (&#34;The Love You Save&#34; and &#34;Never Can Say Goodbye&#34; to name two), and a few Jacksons hits are also not included.  Taken at face value, this collection is exceptional and offers quite an overview of Michael Jackson's recording career. Overall, most of the hit songs are here, but as far as rarities, the most obvious omission is the Thriller era b-side &#34;Can't Get Outta The Rain.&#34; Also, the set would have been worth the price alone had they included his one-time performance of &#34;You Were There&#34; from the Sammy Davis Jr. Anniversary TV Special or Michael's anthem from the Siegfried And Roy Las Vegas Show, called &#34;Mind Is The Magic.&#34;  The good news is that fans who buy this collection will get a few cool songs and demos from the MJ vaults. One song in particular, &#34;On The Line&#34; (written by Babyface) and found only as a bonus track on a European CD single, is so good it is surprising it was never issued as a single in the U.S. back in the 90's.  The bottom line is that &#34;The Ultimate Collection&#34; will be a great addition to any diehard MJ fan's CD collection, but it will leave them skipping past the songs they already own several times over and ultimately leave them wanting even more.Jacksons hits are also not included.    The collection is light on true rarities, b-sides, live songs, alternate takes and demos. We all already have the hits (there are so many Jackson hits collections I have actually lost count), this should have been something more special.    The DVD is the 1992 HBO special which every fan already has. This should have been a live compilation. Maybe the 1987 Japan-only concert special or something as rare. Sony really missed an opportunity here. What Michael Jackson needs is a solid live album. Maybe once they are through skimming the top of the MJJ \\"hits\\" catalog, Sony executives will give true fans a rarities collection worth buying. I'd be happy to advise them on the song list.    The bottom line is that \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" will be a nice addition to any diehard MJJ fan's CD collection, but it will leave them skipping past the songs they already own several times over and \\"ultimately\\" leave them wanting more.    But maybe that was Sony's greedy plan all along.
B00006JJ51|1.0|My mommy forbids me from listening to anything other than country music, and I get made fun of for it. People at school tell me to listen to rap and rock music. One of them reccomended the group N.W.A. . When I asked them what it meant, they told me it stood for (Bad Words) With Attitudes. Now, Martin Luther King, Jr. taught me not to say that word, so I was confused when I heard it being used so much by African Americans. This music is not good for you, it has bad words. I reccomend Toby Keith or Gretchen Wilson, because country is awesome! If you are looking for rap, go buy the Baha Men or Lil Bow Wow. Mommy told me that rap is evil!
B00066N8JS|5.0|Nine Inch Nails' epic concept album of 1994 caused a huge shift in mainstream music. Not only did people get insanely horny thanks to the infamous song \\"Closer\\" (aka the \\"I want to f**k you like an animal\\" song), but people were flat-out amazed that an album of such intensity could ever be released, let alone reach so high on the charts. It was arguably the most intense album to ever be in the mainstream. It was Trent Reznor's downward spiral that got him famous. <br /> <br />No, really. The Downward Spiral told the story of Mr. Self Destruct and his inability to deal with society, religion, and his own self, eventually rising up to overthrow God and, later on, kill himself because of the drastic mistake he realized he made. This type of a concept was never tried before, and it was downright suicide to be this intense and deep when the album is already so high on the charts. But luckily, Mr. Reznor of Nine Inch Nails pulled it off beautifully. <br /> <br />The album is perfect in the most imperfect ways possible. Things like muffled screams and random industrial noises add a sense of mechanical nihilism to the album, which, in turn, adds to the theme and concept of the whole thing. The songs can be drastically changing from one to the next, such as the soft ambience of \\"A Warm Place\\" suddenly shifting to the overwhelming (and overbearing, perhaps) heaviness of \\"Eraser.\\" All of this is made even better by this edition of the album. <br /> <br />It's The Downward Spiral's tenth anniversary this year, and Trent decided to celebrate it by releasing the album all over again on a hybrid SACD, completely remixed and remastered in surround sound. He even threw in a second disc for good measure, with a good mix of b-sides, rarities, and a few unreleased demos. Now, if you don't have an SACD player, don't fret. I don't have one either. These SACD's play on regular CD players, so you needn't worry. The only catch is, it won't be in surround sound. But hey, you get some nifty packaging. That's always a plus. <br /> <br />This is a great start for newer NIN fans, especially with the second disc. It's also an opportunity for the older NIN fans to appreciate Trent Reznor's musical genius all over again. Five out of five stars. Way to go, Mr. Reznor.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I go back and forth with my feelings about this movie every time I see it.  I agree with most of the generally despised aspects of this film (bad character chemistry, ridiculous costumes, extremely slow pace, etc.), but it is easy to forget the circumstances surrounding this film's initial release.  In 1979, the public was starving for Star Trek.  They had been teased with an animated series in the mid-seventies, but it was just not the same as having William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley on the screen.  At the point the film was released, the general public was just elated to have Star Trek back, even if it wasn't their father's Star Trek.  So bearing that in mind, the film was a financial success, even if not necessarily an artistic one.  On the other hand, Jerry Goldsmith's score was wonderful, with a bold, brassy opening theme that exists to this day; mysterious, strange music representing V'Ger, and a delicate, beautiful love theme for Decker and Ilia.  All in all, this is not the best Star Trek movie, but it is MUCH more worthwhile than V or Insurrection.
B000001FTQ|5.0|This EP, in just two songs, captures U2 at the peak of their abilities in a live setting.  \\"Bad\\" has to be one of the single greatest recorded moments in music history.  The arrangements are chill-inducing; Edge, Adam and Larry's playing is faultless; and Bono's vocal is gut-wrenchingly beautiful and impassioned. When he roars, \\"Isolation...desolation...isolation...Let it go...\\", it's undeniably moving. Hearing it at the age of 18, it reinforced, in me, the idea that music can change the world.  Twenty years later, on a good day, I'm still thinking it could.  If nothing else, buy this CD for \\"Bad\\" all by itself.    \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" is nearly as great, and in some ways, improves on the original off \\"Unforgettable Fire\\".  Again, all four members are firing on all cylinders and in total control.  Transcendent.    And I'd have to agree with another reviewer:  \\"Three Sunrises\\" and \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" would have been great on \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" in place of a couple of weaker songs on that album, but I'm just happy they were released at all.    This is the period of U2 (1980-1985) I hold dearest in my heart.
1591840562|5.0|This book is full of \\"golden nuggets\\". Written in a very clear and understandable manner, this book cuts through the 'BS' and goes straight to the issues. Each chapter has a neat \\"FAQ\\" that serves as a review of the chapter and there are also \\"excercises\\" that help personalize the topic for your unique situation. Guy's writing style demonstrates his ethical approach to business and his passion for life. A great and refreshing read - highly recommended!
B00007BKVC|3.0|Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) are two good friends who become fugitives from the law, their lives, and the male-dominated world that oppresses them.  The film succeeds as much as it does due to fine direction by Ridley Scott, a lively screenplay by Callie Khouri, and top-notch performances by Sarandon and Davis.  Somehow, though, these elements didn't gel into a completely satisfying movie experience for me.  There were too many missteps such as the troglodyte truck driver who seems unable to do anything more than grunt and spew obscenities.  It can be seen as a statement of female empowerment, but it accomplishes this by placing its male characters on a spectrum with impotence at one extreme and brutishness on the other.
B00004X01U|5.0|Hello,    This is by second favorite Madonna CD next to Ray of Light. Music is great to dance to and very catchy. This song went to number 1, making it Madonna's 12 number 1 US song. Paradise Not For Me is a hauntingly beautiful song. Great use of strings on Paradise and half of it is sung in French. My fave is Impressive Instant, the sound is so different than anything I have heard, you will dance bigtime! Impressive sounds are what you hear at Discos in France and Madonna has put a different energetic spin to them. Mirwas is a genious! too bad the remixes are not official because they are great to dance to. I Deserve It is a beautiful slow song with a lot of meaning to it. She sings \\"many miles many roads I have traveled falling down on the way\\". She definately deserves it after being in the spotlight for over 20 years now. Madonna also sings her undieing love for hubby Guy Ritchie is this song. Don't Tell Me also has a great message to it and she sings \\"please dont tell me to stop\\" saying people tell her to stop her career and but she wont. The song went to number #5. The guitar playing in Don'T Tell Me and I Deserve It, is absolutely wonderful. I love the way Madonna put that together.  Runaway Lover and Amazing are fast tracks by William Orbit. Runaway Lover is more of a Madonna fast song we are used to listening too. Amazing is very similar to Beautiful stranger. She talks about her pregnancy in \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" which has a beautiful melody to it. WIFLFAG went to #23 in the US. Its a great song and I wish it was in th at least top 20. Then there is Nobody's Perfect, it has unique sounds to it and Madonna sings shes not perfect but \\"I'm doing my best\\" which is so true in life.  Her voice is altered in this song and some versues are whispered by her which gives the song a good effect. Gone is a another beautiful slow song. I love the use of the piano in the back for this stunning song. All 10 songs are just great and enoyable to listen to. Keep upthe good work Madonna. Your fan since 1983.
B00005JLEX|1.0|I heard many good things about seinfeld and one day I decided to watch it, but I couldn't sit through one episode, I kept hearing laughs and laughs over jokes or things that just didn't think were funny at all. <br /> <br />I know there are many fans of this show out there, but if you ask me, Seinfeld is pure cr@p.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is my new favorite movie! I can't wait until it comes out on dvd. My boyfriend and I cried so much through this movie. We were still crying as we walked outside of the theater! And we don't normally cry about a movie!! It's a must-see if you are into movies that actually have something deeper than just sex and violence. Anyone that I know that has seen this movie totally agrees that the Notebook is a classic!!! :)
0385513755|5.0|I've never been in Paris. I wasn't a DaVinci's fan and didn't know much about his works & paintings except Mona Lisa. When I picked up Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code to read, I did have a hard time to follow the Da Vinci's works and some sightseeings in Paris described in the book. Thus, I had my computer connected to Internet besides me to dig out different paintings and photos of what the book mentioned like Louvre, Pentacle, The Last Supper, Opus Dei Headquarters, etc. Luckily, The Da Vinci Code Special Illustrated Edition is just out.<br /><br />I couldn't wait and purchased immediately regardless I have the regular hardcover edition of Da Vinci Code, which I plan to give it to one of my friends. This Special Illustrated Edition is not a cartoon or comic edition of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, nor it is an abridged version. It's a full original version embedded with over 126 colorful pictures & photos besides the text. It saves you lots of time & effort to search from Internet if you don't know how Château de Villette looks like, the overview map of the Louvre, and many other scenes, buildings, paintings mentioned in Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. Overall, it's LOVELY!<br /><br />Undoubtfully Dan Brown has done amazing jobs to his book \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". The story is powerful and magnificent. Mixing with a lot of traceable truth and facts, he made his novel sound extremely convincing and inevitably deluded you from what's real and what's fictional. However, please don't take it too serious, it's just a novel, not a research paper trying to make a breakthrough statement. Overall, the book has quite a lot of twists shocking you. Even the ending has double meanings. Make sure you read the Epilogue chapter, or you won't know where the Holy Grail rests that Dan Brown suggested as the poem below:<br /><br />  \\"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.<br />  The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates.<br />  Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.<br />  She rests at last beneath the starry skies.\\"<br /><br />For people who love deciphering codes, Dan Brown wisely placed some codings on the regular hardcover edition's paper cover. If you pay attention you may find some bold fonts seemed appearing randomly. Link them up and you should see a hint to read.<br /><br />(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 21-Nov-2004)For people who love deciphering codes, Dan Brown wisely placed some codings on the regular hardcover edition's paper cover.

B00000G3AZ|1.0|This movie is Not Jane Austen's work but the making of Hollywood EGO having the audacity to think that they will improve, change and rewrite the story. Does not reflect the brilliance of Austen. Movie is missing too much in script and characters.
B00003CXXM|4.0|...I usually am not a fan of action flicks, but occasionally Hollywood manages to come up with one that is so well-made, well-written and well-acted that you can easily overlook its stock characters and cliches, its unavoidable and fundamental lack of originality, substance, and surprise.<br /><br />Here we have a very capable and original director (Doug Liman, who did the excellent indie film \\"Swingers\\") and two very capable leads , in the always-sympathetic Matt Damon and the strangely fetching Franke Potente (of \\"Run Lola Run\\"), and the gorgeous stage set that is Europe (specifically, Prague standing in for Zurich and parts of Paris, and Paris itself).  My only grumble is that we never get to see Potente in any state of undress, not even undergarments!  But that hardly sinks the movie in and of itself, mind you.<br /><br />The fight scenes are mostly economical and entertaining---in part because Matt Damon employs the rarely-seen and reality-based Filipino martial art of Kali (explosive close quarters elbows, knees, trapping and grappling) as opposed to the usual absurd Hollywood bastardizations of Tae Kwon Do (fancy spinning jump kicks and other transparently useless fluff).  Liman shows a refreshing and admirable self-restraint in these stock action sequences, from the fight scenes to the requisite car chase to the one LARGE EXPLOSION near the end---unlike most action directors, he smoothly blends those formulaic elements into the story without turning them INTO the story itself.  Bang bang, chop socky whack, kaboom kabam---then he moves on instead of dwelling on the special effects.<br /><br />The soundtrack is excellent and adds a lot to the movie's atmospherics---it made me glad to have invested in a decent home theatre sound system with a good subwoofer.<br /><br />All in all, excellent light escapist entertainment when you want it.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I'm not sure what the boys were thinking this time around.  I've liked Green Day for quite a while now, and unlike some old Green Day fans I actually enjoyed the direction they took with Warning.  Given the hype surrounding this release, I was really looking forward to hearing American Idiot.  Boy was I disappointed. <br /> <br />The album, which is a throwback to the rock operas and concept albums of the '70's, is big and bloated.  And worse, it's nothing new.  The title track is standard-issue Green Day, but the second song, titled \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" is a five-part, nine-minute mess.  Didn't we get enough of this from Rush and Pink Floyd?  Do we need it from Green Day?  Self-indulgence of this kind was one of the reasons punk came into existence in the first place.   <br /> <br />Catchy melodies are Green Day's strength, and they should have stuck to what they do well.  Instead they try to be dramatic and relevant, and fail utterly.  Lyrically this effort is sophomoric; musically it is just a rip-off of everyone from T. Rex and Mott the Hoople to Yes.
B0006399FS|4.0|The reviewer Quiros from Costa Rica below me had very good sum up of this record.  Adam & Edge = perfection.  Bono struggles here sometimes with his voice but I dont have problems with lyrics.  They are not the same band as they were in the Joshua Tree days, so Bono cant talk \\"bullet the blue sky\\".  It seems Bono is stuck in this pop phase. it seems the band wanted to break out into a more harder rock format and it was brought back to a more pop/rock format because of bono's songwriting nowadays.  It is still very powerful album, not what I was expecting but good.  U2 still have the capabilities to do many good things and making a good album is one of them.  Sorry for my English.  :)
B00068IOWC|3.0|'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is very much like 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', straight-ahead rock albums mixed with tender ballads and Zooropa-like introspection. After the band reached a creative peak in the late 80's and early 90's, it seems like U2 has turned towards high-energy rock their last 2 releases, a can't miss formula, even moreso considering you have the iconic pairing of Bono and the brilliance of The Edge. There are some nice tracks here, the Jet-sounding 'Vertigo' and some other gems like 'City Of Blinding Lights' and 'All Because Of You'. Long gone are the days where U2 ruled the planet and released landmark albums, but as they reach the twilights of their career, I think U2 owe it to themselves to make music effortlessly without having to brainstorm for a genre defining release. They can afford to now, steeped in their own legacy with the music world recognizing their influence. 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is no 'Joshua Tree' or 'Achtung Baby', but it still has all the U2 elements which makes a U2 album, unmistakably, a U2 album. Dynamic, inspired, socially conscious, and if you ask the band themselves, a release that is nothing short of perfection. Yet like I said, if you ask the band themselves.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I haven't seen this much intensity in a \\"live\\" performance since viewing \\"Rush in Rio\\". It is refreshing as well to see the dark sided imagery the band portrays take a back seat to pure energy in a live performance (my personal favorite is the cover version of \\"thoughtless\\"). <br />Although nothing can better than seeing Evanescence live for yourself , if you were ever debating about going to one of they're shows , this should be the deciding factor. The dvd is well worth the purchase price and more.
B0006399FS|5.0|Pop + All That You Can't Leave Behind = 1/2 of How to Dismantle...  <br />this is the album I've been waiting for since Achtung Baby. I don't know if its as good, but it rocks man. Great Guitars and solid rock n' roll again, u2 caught my attention again. Best album of the year.
B0006399FS|4.0|I've listened to this album quite a bit. Personally, I preferred their last one. U2's albums often take time to grow on a person, but I can't see this one hitting me as well as their \\"all that you can't leave behind\\", not to mention obviously some of the older ones.    City of Blinding Lights is probably the best song on the album, and it will be the next single (I'll be shocked if that isn't the case). Most of the other songs are good, my least favourite being track 4 (love and peace, or else).    Everybody had a valid hint of what was to come with the single from this. Beautiful Day was a spectacular song, through and through (worth the price of the CD alone). Vertigo fell flat. I don't think anybody can really deny that. It's somewhat catchy, but nothing more. Sadly, this album lacks the \\"Holy crap, it's time to turn the volume up!\\"-factor that some may be hoping for. U2 is my favourite group, bar none. I wish I could have given this album a 5 stars, but it simply didn't earn it. I'm not going to sit here and lament the bygone days of The Joshua Tree, as any fanboy in the world can do (and has done), but U2 has done better than this album. They can do better. Hopefully the next one will be.

B00027JYLC|5.0|This movie was fantastic, even for today, it's a must see.  It's about this circus with a sideshow, (all of the sideshow performers are genuine \\"freaks\\") and the sideshow members are looked down upon by the Normal people.  Eventually, the Freaks get their revenge.  Really good, but short.

If you are an existing Journey fan then take a trip through the time of your life and actually \\"see\\" the music delivered instead of just listening. Steve Augeri delivers with an amazing stage presence and Jonathan, Deen, Neal and Ross prove that the \\"Journey\\" continues. Go on, you know it makes sense!

0790734060|5.0|Before I can start the actual review of this movie, there is one item I must first address: Many reviewers have taken this movie to task for its less-than-accurate portrayal of both Mozart and Salieri. While this is most likely true (I do not know all the facts, and, therefore, cannot completely comment on them), I am more interested in the movie itself than whether or not 100% of the facts are accurate. After all, Hollywood has never truly told a \\"true story\\" without some embellishment. <br /> <br />With that out of the way, I can honestly say that \\"Amadeus\\" (Best Picture Oscar winner) is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is also one of those rare movies that just get better and better with each viewing. <br /> <br />\\"Amadeus\\" tells three different stories during its 2 hours, 40 minutes run time (the Director's Cut has approximately another 20 minutes of footage). Normally, having this many different stories to tell would weigh a movie down. But in the hands of director Milos Forman (he directed the 1975 classic \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"), this movie weaves each story into each other flawlessly. <br /> <br />The first story is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (side note: when watching this movie, keep in mind that the name Amadeus means \\"beloved of God\\"). Mozart was nothing less than a child prodigy when it came to music: he was composing full-scale operas by the time he was 6. <br /> <br />But Mozart was more than a musical genius. Played with perfection by Tom Hulce (he won Italy's version of an Oscar for Best Foreign Actor for this film), Mozart was a vulgar, impish brat who love to play around as much as he loved to compose. Mozart's operas pushed the boundaries, and in most cases these operas are more appreciated today than they were in his time. <br /> <br />The second story is about Antonio Salieri (played by F. Murray Abraham, who won a Best Actor Oscar for this movie), a fairly gifted composer who so longed to leave a lasting impression on the world with his music. He believed that God had given him this desire, and the first time he met Mozart he knew that God had not given him the gift to match the desire. <br /> <br />Salieri would eventually become awed by, envious of, and jealous of Mozart all at the same time. Salieri never missed a single opera performance of Mozart's, simultaneously seething at and worshipping the musical genius. These conflicting feelings would eventually drive Salieri insane, splitting his mind in two. But this was a quiet insanity, which went unnoticed by all. <br /> <br />The third story is about Salieri as an old man. Mozart has long been dead and buried, and Salieri, convinced he is to blame for Mozart's death, constantly cries out for Mozart to forgive him. The entire movie is shown through Salieri's \\"confession\\" to a priest. But it's not just forgiveness that Salieri wants. He also wants God to accept the blame for giving Salieri the desire to make beautiful music, but giving Mozart the ability to do so. <br /> <br />F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is perfectly understated and sublimely subtle. You can see the insanity take root and, eventually, take over Salieri, all from the tiniest movements in Abraham's face, eyes, and hands. You can see the music that Salieri sees in his head, and you can tell that Salieri has no way of releasing that music for the world to hear. There is no question that Abraham deserved the Best Actor Oscar for this movie. <br /> <br />In addition to Hulce and Abraham, there is one more star that must be acknowledged: the music. All throughout the movie, various Mozart and Salieri scores can be heard. Unlike most movies where the music is background filler, these melodies are integral to the movie. At times, we see portions of various operas being performed. Other times the music we hear is what either Mozart or Salieri is hearing. The music was a perfect match throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br />Early in 2002, a director's cut version was released to theaters, followed by a video and DVD release later in the year. Most \\"Amadeus\\" fans (and yes, there are quite a few of us) were a little put off by the R rating (the original version was rated PG). While the additional footage does help to clarify the hostility that Mozart's wife had towards Salieri, many fans felt that the nude scene that was added back in was unnecessary. To add insult to injury, the original version was no longer available on video. After much backlash, the original version of \\"Amadeus\\" was released on both VHS and DVD in early 2004. <br /> <br />Although I have not seen the director's cut version, I think the original version is perfect as is. No nudity scene was ever necessary, even if it does help better explain the hostility noted above (personally, I believe the scene could have been done without the nudity). <br /> <br />If you are going to buy or rent this movie (and I recommend you buy), get the original PG-rated movie first. You can always view the director's cut after that. <br />

B0006399FS|4.0|Irish rock vets U2 have released another fine album.  This album has influences from multiple stages of U2's career, and highlights include tracks like Miracle Drug, Yahweh, Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own, City of Blinding Lights, and Original of the Species.  Bono's voice is a bit worn but his lyrics remain in top form along with Edge's guitar work.  Modern rock music often lacks the tuneful artistry found in U2's albums, so this album is likely to be well-received, even though it doesn't have anything that quite matches captivating U2 anthems from the Joshua Tree through Achtung Baby era.  This isn't U2's best but it is a solid album that should satisfy many fans and demonstrate why U2 has remained so successful for so many years - they continue to release memorable material and have been able to stay together and productive while other acts have lost their luster.
B00066N8JS|5.0|This album still carries me through many angry & confusing times, and I've been listening to it for 10 years! Now with the Deluxe Edition we get TDS remastered. Yes, it makes a difference. The bass is more punchy, the guitars are more in your face & growly, the weird little details that you thought you'd heard all ready take on new dimensions. Basically you can hear all the layers with more clarity, and you'll probably hear some layers you never even noticed before. The 2nd disc doesn't have anything new except the demo versions of three songs, it's interesting to see what these songs were before they were \\"fully realized.\\" Will I listen to them over and over? Probably not. If you're a rabid fan you probably all ready own this. If you're new to NIN get THIS, it's the first thing I'd recommend.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I don't know how to describe this album.  Some days I'd say depressing, others beautiful, others awe inspiring.  The first time I heard this album at a local bookstore I was hooked and I listened to it non-stop.  This is such a different type of music that it really deserves a listen from everyone.  It is best to listen to this album straight through so that it can captivate you and so that you can really see what is has to offer, but if not the tracks stand alone just fine. <br /> <br />I call it a tapestry because the style of this music is just that.  The haunting yet peaceful instrumentation and the chilling vocals send you on a journey into another land. This album is flawless in that it perfectly accomplishes what it is trying to do.  I'm hooked by all their music now and although there are times when I don't have the mental or emotional capacity to listen to it, it draws me in anyway.

B0006284JQ|1.0|Your Worst Nightmare is definitely MY worst nightmare. I seen a picture of him on fugly.net and..well, I have a slight case of insomnia thanks to him.     Anyway, about this album.  Britney Spears has come a long way from where she started. She started out as an innocent creature who girls with flat chests looked up to (cuz she had implants), and is now a first class [...]! She is non derserving of kids looking up to her. You can look at her and all that you will see is someone who doesn't have very much to look forward to in life and that I dont know why 10 year old girls ever looked up to her. Her songs and titles are disgusting and just down right dirty. Thanks to Britney, girls are all turning in to little whores all around the world.    This is really original ground breaking music for Britney! What an \\"artist\\"! It doesn't look like a cheap copy of every other CD she's made with a little bit more Britney-esque sluttiness to try and sell it. Honestly, if you think this is music, or think she's an artist...you, my friend, are a moron.
B0006399FS|3.0|In my opinion, this album continues the style found on \\"All that you can't leave behind\\". It is classic U2, I like it. It is not what all other U2 albums were: completely new stuff.
B0006399FS|3.0|Been a longtime fan (day 1 actually), and have found the albums getting weaker with age.  This one is good, it's a Unforgettable Fire meets Actung Baby meets All That You Can't Leave Behind, but not near as strong as any of those.  U2 has put out several prolific peices over the years, but not on this one.  Worth the $10, but don't expect anything ground breaking.

It was so fun to read it together on the plane and really gave us a great perspective of this long ignored country.  Bill Bryson is a great writer combining factual information with the humor of his adventures in researching for this book.  Through this you gain a love for this country and the people within.
B0006399FS|4.0|Ok, can we please stop comparing \\"Bomb\\" to epic U2, such as The Joshua Tree, which I think is by far the best U2 album, and arguably the greatest rock album of all time (sorry, Beatles fans).   <br /> <br />It took a second and third listen, but I absolutely love \\"Bomb\\".  It is like a good wine-- it keeps getting better with each play.  It is an confluence of many U2 styles-- from the punk sounds of Vertigo and Love, Peace, or Else, to the keyboards of City of Blinding Lights (which I have to admit sounded a bit like Yanni the first time I heard it) to the scratchy sound, religious/spiritual undertones, and laid back pace of Yahweh and One Step Closer.   <br /> <br />True, there are some obvious shortcomings and annoyances that are only evident to the ear of the true U2 fan and listener--  just when the Edge hits a throwback chord and you think the song is going to join \\"Streets\\" and \\"Bad\\" in epic company, he either goes to another edgier chord, or the song ends; \\"Yahweh\\" is a solid effort, but could have been placed earlier in the track list.  It is definitely an upgrade from \\"Grace\\" which ended ATYCLB in a rather bland manner.  In my opinion, albums should be stories that end with you wanting more (e.g., All That I Want Is You from R&H).  I would have loved to see \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" end \\"Bomb\\"; U2 is a commercial success.  We have to accept that U2 is the greatest band in the world because of their longevity and commercial success.  They know how to promote, and as a product of that, they might be more inclined to make shorter, punchier and more radio friendly songs.  Early on, they chose to do their social activism more through their music.  Now, I am perfectly fine if they choose to do it more through their physical actions (which Bono does very effectively); Bono's voice is a bit scratchy and unrefined and unmelodic at times, but that makes for a bit more live sounding album, not a bad thing in my book. <br /> <br />The strength of the record is that itdoes have two to three solid tracks to fall back on after the commercially inclined, radio friendly \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Sometimes...On Your Own\\", \\"...Blinding Lights\\"' and \\"Vertigo\\".   Though, these supporting tracks lack the power and consistency of JT's unreleased tracks \\"God's Country\\", \\"One Tree Hill\\", and \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\", which in my opinion made that album Epic, they are step above the secondary tracks on Pop and ATYCLB. <br /> <br />My main point is that we should judge this effort for what it is, and not for what it was supposed to be (A bit of pre-launch overhype probably fueled this).  Sure it could have been an Epic record, but I will settle for classic anytime from my favorite group just like I will admire and accept 23 ppg from a 40 yr. old Michael Jordan. <br /> <br /> <br />
0553801503|3.0|It is sad that the review (in quotes below) I wrote in 2004 proved prescient in fears expressed about George Martin's having set up an almost impossible narrative structure for consistent success. He will need to discipline himself to prune his baroque profusion and restore a more austere edge and clarity to his plots. He has deeply disappointed so many fans, but most of us hope he will respond by applying his genius to the very different discipline needed to maintain and conclude his extraordinary series.      \\"I am not sure how you can write a \\"review\\" of an unpublished and unread book. It is not even a preview really, but perhaps a forecast.  The first three books of \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" were extraordinary and distinctive. One of the fascinating features was the huge array of unfinished twists and trails laid out in this opening trilogy. This complexity, plus the way that George Martin's world is indifferent to the fate of its characters, where any strategy, however cunning or courageous, may triumph or fail, adds to the readers gnawing curiosity about what lies ahead.  However, this almost unchecked proliferation of plots and tales creates a colossal challenge to the author if he is to produce a coherent and worthy follow-through. The repeated postponements of the 4th book raise the suspicion that the author may have been struggling to do this. Will he end up having to release something that fails to match the ambitious project implied by the previous novels? Or will his readers, who have already waited over 4 years for this one, have to wait another decade before the promised second trilogy is complete. Or will George Martin join that distinguished band of artist who leave a tantalizing but unfinished work?   Lets hope we and the writer all live long enough and that the wait proves worthwhile!\\"

B0006399FS|4.0|U2, known primarily for grandiose convictions, an intense desire to be the biggest band in the world, and a huge, guitar-driven sound with soaring vocals, have become rather conservative in their evolution.  Retreating from their 1980s work, U2 primarily focused on broadening their artistic pallette, bringing in electronica, techno, and other weird fusions.  This created a problem with U2's fan base as the decade drew to a close, because the farther U2 strayed into the eclectic musical territory they were pursuing, the more difficult it was for the fans to follow their evolution.  When U2 experimented successfully, they made some of the most successful music of their career (ACHTUNG BABY).  Yet they grounded their experimentation with a sense of purpose, and they always kept their ambition within the elasticity of the fans' and critics' admiration.  At least, they tempered their music with a good dose of rock in the early 90s.  ACHTUNG BABY, one of their most experimental, evolutionary records, has been universally hailed by both fans and critics alike as some of their most significant music.  ACHTUNG BABY set the course for much of the decade, with U2 going more and more into post-modernism.     Then the 1997 nadir POP happened.  Not that POP was necessarily a BAD album.  Instead of sounding a natural progression of the band's ambition, the experimentation never really gelled, much like R.E.M.'s UP.  POP comes across as torn between two different directions - the anthem-driven, spiritually aware U2 lamenting a loss world, and a strange, dance-driven beat that is supposed to celebrate living with almost primitive desire, instead of commenting on the moral and social decline of earth.  Both a critical and commercial flop, U2 seriously re-evaluated their status as artists after POP, and streamlined their sign, making a very conscious return to their earlier sound.    In 2000, U2 delivered the followup to POP, ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND.  The title is more than aptly representative of that album.  Abandoning wholly the more progressive elements of their music, LEAVE BEHIND sounds like U2 trying to write a classicist record, returning to the styles of their 1980s output.  While it was fun to hear them return to that era, ALL THAT YOU, out of necessity, didn't have a lot of artistic evolution.  That wasn't the point.    So it's little surprise that U2, has streamlined their music even more on HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  While their early records were both revolutionary and a thrill to listen too, and the early 1990s work pure genius, HTDAATB is a much more calculated record, made to sound like classic U2 instead of just being U2.  U2's experimentation had gotten them in trouble, and this is the result.  U2, instead of playing the music they want to play, are now playing to win back the audience that much of their 1990s work alienated.  In many ways, like Essau yielding to Jacob, U2 has traded their birthright for porridge, selling their artistic evolution out for trying to be the biggest band in the world.      Although POP did have some unmitigated disasters, at least it was the old U2, wedded to pushing the envelop with cutting edge music.  That's the real irony of HTDAATB; the new U2 is returning back to the old styles to win back the fans, while the old U2 was much more interested in creating worthwhile music, combining their ambition with their musical sensibilities, growing artistically and commercially.  This is a record that the old U2, after making the records they did in the 1990s, would never make.  The old U2 would keep pressing on, pursing their musical evolution.  But POP happened and U2 has been reeling ever since.    While this may seem to be a primarily negative review of U2's latest effort, there are some postive notes.  While artistically a puzzling, entirely too conservative affair calculated to win back fans, there's some great music here.  The lead off-single, \\"Vertigo,\\" is jagged guitar rock.  \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" plays like we're back in the 1980s.  \\"Love or Peace\\" is an interesting comment on war.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,\\" written in 2001 when Bono's father died, shows us Bono at his most vulnerable.  \\"Yahweh\\" (or to be strictly orthodox, YHWH), gives us U2 at their most spiritually thirsty.  It has great music and a great sound, but that doesn't make HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB the instant classic ACHTUNG BABY and THE JOSHUA TREE are.     U2's end result is rather a half-breed.  HTDAATB is much too conservative and calculated to be truly revolutionary and an undeniable classic, but also just too good to write off completely (mostly because U2's trying to recreate an era of their career where they were writing and performing fantastic music.  Hence my four star rating, though artistically it's three).  For the causal fan, this may be a subtle point; it has a warm, big sound, and has excellent music.  For those who loved U2 for being fearless pioneers will be rather disappointed.      In ways, I belong to both camps.  There's some wonderful songs here.  But I miss U2's sense of adventure.    [There are three songs left off the album that I am aware of.  One, \\"Fast Cars,\\" has surfaced on the UK and Japanese pressings as a bonus track.  The band did covered Kraftwerk (\\"Neon Lights\\").  There's a non LP track on the second \\"Vertigo\\" single, \\"Are You Gonna Wait Forever?\\"]
B0000CFW87|5.0|I was going to sing \\"You Raise Me Up\\" at a wedding so I bought this CD begrudgingly. But what I found was an entire CD that I can listen to over and over without skipping any of the songs.   <br /> <br />Josh Groban has a unique voice - I would say it's 50% opera, 25% pop, 25% broadway/jazz.  And his music is unusually varied- I love the Spanish, French, and Italian pieces on this CD.  With such a versatile voice, it's hard to believe that he's really only just getting started! I'm looking forward to a lot more music from Josh Groban in the coming few decades.
B0006399FS|4.0|Forget what you may have heard on the I-Pod commercials. \\"Vertigo\\" is just a sample of the music that makes up HTDAOB. This record has all the elements of a potential classic, and it's brand new! U2 gets it right on this record, they give us \\"old\\" U2...but in a very new way. \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It...\\", and \\"Love and Peace\\" are all in line for massive radio airplay. There are other tracks like \\"Yahway\\" and \\"Crumbs from the Table\\" that are more for \\"album listeners only\\". This is a record that is so badly needed in pop culture, we need U2 to kick everyone in the ass again! And if you had any doubts about if lads from Ireland still had \\"it\\"...doubt no more..because this record proves that U2 still hold the title of \\"Biggest Band in the World\\"
B0006399FS|1.0|This new album sounds like an album a bunch of 40 year olds would make, full of nice and decent melodies. U2 have always been about staying relevant and being fresh and they've managed to do, at least until Pop. I still don't know what happened after Pop, which was an extraordinary and smash album. U2 turned for grammy worthy music, becoming to obsessed with being the biggest band in the world, no matter music. HTDAAB just seems like a safe, adult pop record full of over-baked tunes. With headphones is even worse. Overall this album is a watered down version of ATYCLB. For sure it will hit number one, thanks to many U2 completists who will insist on buying it. <br />Remember the second best seller album from all times ?... <br /> <br />U2 have become comfortably numb
B00068IOWC|4.0|U2, known primarily for grandiose convictions, an intense desire to be the biggest band in the world, and a huge, guitar-driven sound with soaring vocals, have become rather conservative in their evolution.  Retreating from their 1980s work, U2 primarily focused on broadening their artistic pallette, bringing in electronica, techno, and other weird fusions.  This created a problem with U2's fan base as the decade drew to a close, because the farther U2 strayed into the eclectic musical territory they were pursuing, the more difficult it was for the fans to follow their evolution.  When U2 experimented successfully, they made some of the most successful music of their career (ACHTUNG BABY).  Yet they grounded their experimentation with a sense of purpose, and they always kept their ambition within the elasticity of the fans' and critics' admiration.  At least, they tempered their music with a good dose of rock in the early 90s.

B00005ALP6|3.0|The movie My Fair Lady was based on the book by G.B. Shaw, Pygmalion. It tries to show the feelings and the personality of the characters in the book but I don't think this is done too well. The book and movie vary in certain aspects, like the fact that the movie is a musical and also some of the words are changed, added, and sometimes even left out. I think that many of Shaw's satirical ideas and messages are misinterpreted in the movie or not shown well enough. <br /> <br />Some of the characters do not have the same personality as the book. For example, Higgins, in the book, has a very strong and controlling personality, as well as Eliza. In the movie, though, Eliza's part of this personality was not portrayed as well. It seemed as though she was more of a gentle women just trying to survive. Some of these things were changed to make it a more interesting movie and to capture its audience, but I think Shaw would have been disappointed by it. In the movie they exaggerate the upper class and its elegance, like in the party where everyone is dressed in black and white and everything was done with extreme care and elegance. Also, the part where Higgins puts the teacup on his head was funny but not what Shaw would have done. <br /> <br />I think that although the movie was good and entertaining, it cannot really compete with the book since it does not express Shaw's original ideas. The movie changed some ideas around and added new things to the setting and characters to make it a more interesting movie but I think that Shaw would have definitely made the move differently. <br />
B0000025ZF|5.0|This is brilliant and up there with any thing he did with Floyd and better than anything Floyd has has done since his departure. That said a lot of the conceptual techniques that the Floyd used on their classic albums are still there. The ambient sounds,a recurring melody thats seems to bind the album together and a sense that the album finishes as it had begun giving a feeling of completeness (remember how fond of the circle the Floyd were). These techniques along with amazing Lyrics and Claptons guitar tones pull the listener into a trip into the subconcious. Roger gets very bitter and shouty mid way through the album which makes for very uneasy listening but what did you expect from the man behind The Wall.
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm in high school and most of the kids in my class dont listen to u2, probably because they think its unhip to listen to a bunch of old guys play rock n roll. But I got a copy of the new album from out of all people, my dad!! I never thought I'd be saying that...I might be moshing to VERTIGO with my pops at the next u2 concert. Ya, that will ever happen. Anyway, this is a really cool cd, I love Original Species and Sometimes You Can't Make it on your own. But ahhh....City of Blinding Lights. that's an awesome song, it reminds me of their old song Where the Streets Have No Name but better. Will u2 fans kill me for saying that? Anyway, I love their new album, even if my friends don't. They can listen to all the bubble gum pop they want, Ill jam to these guys and my boys the Killers. They know they can't dance but at least they know (wink_)
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Ok, This movie, was very dissapointing.  After the first fight with 3 agents and Neo, I thought, this was gonna be good.  But then the movie just goes on for about a 55 minute streak of long boring and some not needed diolauge(Such as making that 16 year old kid that looks up to Neo look bad)<br /><br />The next time we get some action is the Zion dance ball?  Hey we get to see Neo and Trinity get intamite, and it's a whole lot worse than cinamax.  And the dance sceene along with it I could help but laugh.  Gee what's more funny that seeing 1,000,000 people do the caveman dance, and some queer as folk?(Didn't Neo in the first one say Trinity looked like a man.  UUGH!!)<br /><br />Finally hollywood action breaks out in the Burley Brawl, where Neo takes on about 100 agent smiths.  The fight was pretty entertaining, but it was getting repetitive, and after he flew off, I was just wondering, why the fudge didn't he do that sooner?!  Sometimes they have too much diolauge before they just get to the freakin point(EX. The frenchman talks for like 7 minutes before he answers Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity's question.  And the whole kiss thing is stupid(If I was Neo, I would choose that chick he was kissing over Trinity).<br /><br />Now the chase sceene is waaaay toooo long!!  It wasn't really a pulse raiser.  It's really pretty boring, and it gets more, and more boring to the end.<br /><br />Then after that it takes like 40 minutes for the movie to end.  This is suppose to be an action movie, but yet everyones mouths, not moves(Sadly) was doing all the talking.<br /><br />This movie accually had a pretty lame plot, but the seriously needed a editor.  Because the diolauge made the movie more slower, boring, and retarted.  I just can't say how dissapointed I was.  This movie just basicly dragged, but I was under the immpression that this movie was gonna go out with flying colors.  Guess what I was dead wrong<br /><br />Everyone who loved the Matrix might or might not like this, I didn't, and for those who hated this most likley won't like revolutions, altho I thought it was ok.<br /><br />Peacenot like this, I didn't, and for those who hated this most likley won't like revolutions, altho I thought it was ok. <br /> <br />Peace
B0006399FS|5.0|THE. BEST. ALBUM. OF. THE. YEAR.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|What an awesome movie!  While I agree with one other reviewer that the movie left out loads of important information that is contained in the book, the film is still outstanding.  I would definatley encourage the viewer to read the book (before or after); it will make much more sense.  I think JK Rowling has proven to be one of the most important children's writers of the 21st century.  This series has made kids want to read...even the big kids like me!
0395389496|5.0|What could be more enthralling than to be whisked away to see Santa and to receive the first gift of the season? Such is the case in this delightful story. The Polar Express takes our narrator to the North Pole where he selects only a bell from Santa's sleigh as his gift. He loses it on the way home, only to recover it wrapped under the tree. Only those who believe in Santa can hear the bell ring.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tale, highly entertaining to children. It also serves a gentle hint that Santa exists only with those who believe. Highly recommended read.
0780631684|3.0|\\"Final Destination\\" is a pretty good flick considering that it's filed under the \\"Teen Slasher\\" title.  The concept of Death coming after those who have thwarted their fate seems fairly original to me.  I don't recall any other movie using this concept.<br /><br />As most of you probably know, the story starts out with a young man(Devon Sawa) having a vision of Flight 180, the flight he and his classmates happen to be on, exploding into a ball of flames.  He freaks out, gets himself and some of the other students and a teacher booted off of the plane and shortly thereafter, his vision becomes truth.  He's considered a prime suspect for planting a bomb on the plane.<br /><br />One by one, however, his classmates begin to die in some rather unorthodox ways.  The agents tailing Sawa happen to notice that he has been around when most of these deaths occur, further incriminating him.  Sooner or later Sawa, Ali Larter, and a few of the other surviviors realize that Death is hunting them down in the order that they should have died in the plane explosion.<br /><br />This is where the train goes off the tracks.  The plot gets a little bit loopy and things get rather silly as Death picks off the survivors one by one.  The death scenes are rather original, and some of them make you cringe for a second as Death narrowly misses his victims.  Of course, you have to wonder how Death can pull off a plane explosion, but can't manhandle a few puny high schoolers after they avert him the first time around.  Just don't take this movie too seriously, and I'm sure everything will be okay.  Look beyond the absurdities and you'll love every minute of it.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad flick.  The story, though somewhat absurd, is original and the pacing of the film is perfect.  The acting is solid, though Sawa seems a little bit stiff compared to the others.  Ali Larter does a fine job as the loner who is the first to believe in Sawa's character.  All of the death scenes are morbidly entertaining.  I'm sure everyone has heard about the scene with the bus.  If not, keep your eye out for it.  It's one of the quickest, most violent deaths I've seen in the past few years.  Also, look for the guy from \\"Candyman.\\"<br /><br />Recommended to teen slasher fans who like gore more than actual scares and anyone who just wants a neat popcorn flick to kill a little time.  This one is entertaining enough to fill that need.es are morbidly entertaining.  I'm sure everyone has heard about the scene with the bus.  If not, keep your eye out for it.

B0006399FS|4.0|<br />Sure, this new U2 album does not add anything newish or experimental to their already impressive back-catalogue. Does it have to? Not for my part. U2 is like an old wine. Sometimes you forget how it tasted. Drinking it again it gives you a warm and pleasant feeling. <br />And certainly the new songs has to sink in. They are not easy to listen to. I' ve listened to all tracks 3 times in a row and some of them still leave me with a awkward feeling. To begin with the last song Yahweh: the opening is a far-fetched tune. When listening to it, I felt the urge to call up producer Chris Thomas to produce it again. Get rid of the synthesizers and just leave the guitar, drums and bass intact. That would have made a great track. Besides opener Vertigo which is a killer song: short and partly derived from The Hives, The Thrills, The Stills and The Chills (whatever)-hype, the outstanding tracks are Crumbs From Your Table, Miracle Drug and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. It is fair to say that they are no simple riffs and song structures like in The Ol' Days. Well, we are in a new era! No need for a new Sunday Bloody Sunday. Or a New Year's Day revisited! U2 does what it does best: making a qualitive nice album. And on the whole: it is better than the slick and tame production of ATYCLB. Most of the songs here are poignant, feverish and atmosperically inspired in comparision. But I have to chew on it. Give it a rest. And then someday I will decide if U2 has definitely become Old League. <br />

0064409422|5.0|There are two types of people in this world: Tolkien people and Lewis people. I am the latter. I grew up on this fantastic story about four children, who are taken in by a professor and find the magical land of Narnia in the back of a wardrobe. Narnia is under the spell of a terrible witch; part jinn and part giantess. Because of her spell, it is always winter and never Christmas. The land is ruled by Aslan the Lion, a symbol of Christ, who eventually sacrifices himself for Edmund, one of the children. Edmund had allied with the witch for some enchanted Turkish Delight but soon realized his error and rejoined the side of good. For this, he has drawn the ire of the witch, who orders his execution. Aslan is restored, the tables crack, and the witch is defeated. <br />This is a beautifully written tale about the power of sacrificial and redemptive love. If you are a fan of high fantasy, this is the book for you.
B0006399FS|5.0|what were they thinking calling this the album? some like it, but i can't be put in that group. it is another u2 classic album though, i wouldn't call it a masterpiece like some have on these reviews. also, why are people suddenly bashing the last album? i thought it was a great, had worldwide acclaim, and helped my family get through the aftershocks of 9/11. so far i like it better than this new one. i think the bomb has more strength because there are no real fillers on it, but the last record had \\"kite\\" which is their greatest song of the past 10 years. highlights of the bomb are clearly \\"all because of you\\" and \\"crumbs from your table\\". i love \\"vertigo\\" and its a shame the album couldn't be in the same vein as the lead single, its really exciting. still, i do enjoy \\"a man and a woman\\" and \\"one step closer\\" two of the album's more slower songs. great album overall, just come up with a better title next time.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is a very good collection of Neil Young and it's aboot time! The main grips I have is that songs such as \\"Powderfinger\\" \\"Words\\" \\"Buffalo Springfeild\\" or \\"Razor Love\\" didn't find their way on to this collection. Everyone has their ideas of what should go on a greatest hits collection and that's just mine. everything is debatable. Anyway, the absolute essentials are here with tracks like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" \\"Heart of Gold\\" \\"Hey hey\\" \\"My My\\" and \\"Rock'n in the Free World\\" Not only are they essential Neil Young tracts but they're essential songs to the fabric of Rock and Roll.

B000001E18|5.0|As U2 prepares for the release of yet another studio album, this one supposedly heading back towards the band's flag-waving days of innocence and political angst (or however the critics usually put it), I've been listening back over their past releases and finding that I have a much greater appreciation for their 90s work than I ever did before.  Not to malign \\"War\\" or \\"Joshua Tree,\\" which are both great, but I think that U2 really hit its stride doing the things it is trying to escape from at present.<br /><br />People call this album \\"experimental,\\" or \\"difficult,\\" or refer to it as techno-driven electro-music of some sort.  Well, I don't buy it.  There are elements of techno used here, but it's rock, and it's U2, and it's accessible.  In fact, I think of this as their most grounded album, precisely because they aren't dealing with global politics or hate or the ravages of drug addiction as their primary themes for these songs.  These are songs about life, and winding one's way through the maze of modern sensory overload.  Even though the songwriter is a multimillion-dollar-rock-star kinda guy, the songs have humility and manage to sound very honest and universal in a way that the more pretentious earlier work did not.  My favorite is \\"Some Days,\\" literally a song about how life is lived on a day-to-day basis with ups and downs for everyone.  Like the old adage, Bono admits that he has some good days, and some learning days.  That says a lot for the man.  Far more than \\"I'm at a place called Vertigo/it's everything I wish I didn't know/but you give me something I can feel/ yeah yeah yeah yeah...\\".  And on the last track, Bono turns over lead duties to Johnny Cash, whose take on these amazing lyrics is beyond words.<br /><br />I could go on about how this disc is \\"unfairly maligned\\" but then I'd sound like a grouchy middle-aged rock critic.  I'll just say that it impacted me in a very personal way, which is more than can be said for any other of U2's albums.  It's a shame that U2 seems to be moving far, far away from this sound and trying to return to the days of Live Aid.  If only they'd read their own press.  If I only I could write it.<br /><br />-HWt's a shame that U2 seems to be moving far, far away from this sound and trying to return to the days of Live Aid.  If only they'd read their own press.  If I only I could write it. <br /> <br />-HW
0385513755|4.0|As some people have already pointed out, this book may look like a disguised research work rather than a novel. However, it is not a perfect research either, because certain details, though presented as facts, are fiction. Some of these details are not very relevant (e.g. the number of glass panes in the Louvre pyramid, fake security cameras, etc.) and the book would probably be better off without them. I would give it 5 stars for the plot, but if anyone ever thinks to make a movie based on it, there's plenty of work to polish the layout.
B00003CXC6|4.0|This is the type of movie that will make you think. For those that want to disengage their brain and be entertained - look elsewhere. This is an intriguing movie where the witnesses of horrific act each tell their own version of what happened. The story takes a peek into how the mind copes with what it can't understand (or isn't ready to). For those unfamiliar with Kurosawa's work, this film is a masterpiece. Kurosawa makes clever use of the camera in building the audience's suspense in a very similar fashion to what Alfred Hitchcock did. Contemporary audiences may find this technique more agitating than viewers in the 1950's as audience attention spans have shrunk - however this only makes the technique more effective.  <br /> <br />For those seeking a psychological exploration of the human mind at it's worst (and best), you will definitely enjoy this film. It bears resemblance to classic greek plays where the audience is asked to think and reflect rather than be whirled around on ride like modern films. For film students, it is an first-hand example of innovation in film-making technique and dramatic effect.

B0006399FS|1.0|Ok, U2 released a new album...wait a minute, is there any new ? I dont think so. Just look at the band, they look exactly the same as All That You Cant Live Behind Times. The same thing happen with music...ok, better read this professional review !!    CHIGAGO SUN TIMES    Twenty-eight years after forming in Dublin, U2 has become the Rolling Stones. Both superstar acts have larger-than-life frontmen whose posing and preening is both their strength and their weakness. Both boast perpetually cool guitarists who serve as the groups' musical engines, and both have secret weapons in the form of deceptively simple but amazingly powerful drummers.    Unfortunately, both have also long since morphed from vital, creative rock groups into monolithic money machines, giant corporations that turn out new product -- er, albums -- primarily to fuel lucrative tours of the world's enormodomes.    Like 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" U2's heavily hyped 11th studio effort, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\\" which arrives in stores Tuesday, is less of an artistic statement or a significant step forward than a simulation of what some unadventurous fans think a U2 album ought to sound like, and at times it veers obnoxiously close to self-parody.  Witness the album opener and first single, \\"Vertigo,\\" which reeks of formula: Start with a grandiose Edge guitar line that recurs in the bombastic choruses; break it down to some tinkling atmospherics in the quiet verses and oh-so-arty mid-song break, and let Bono wail with great emotion about Jesus, \\"those bullets [that] rip the sky\\" and how deeply he feels.    Feels what? That question is never answered in this particular ditty, but you can tell by the way Bono is screaming that he feels something, man. \\"Whoo-hoo!\\" and \\"Turn it up!\\" he yelps.    Rather than vertigo, the dizzying sensation of the world spinning around you, the song evokes the feeling of deja vu, the sense that you've been here and done this before. My favorite partcomes when Bono counts the band in: \\"Uno, dos, tres, catorce!\\" In case your Spanish is as bad as his, that translates as, \\"One, two, three, 14!\\" And that's as close to a quirky curveball as this long-running group gets in any of these 11 songs.    Looking back at the Rolling Stones' extensive catalog, the most die-hard fan will grant that the group's last great album was 1978's \\"Some Girls,\\" an effort whose raw energy, brave experimentation and self-deprecating humor was inspired by the punk explosion of the time. For U2, it's been downhill since the one-two punch of 1991's \\"Achtung Baby\\" and 1993's \\"Zooropa,\\" whose raw energy, brave experimentation and self-deprecating humor were inspired by the alternative explosion of the time.    Bono, the Edge, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. were prodded to stretch out and challenge themselves on those albums by the arty but populist production team of Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and they were rewarded with the strongest efforts of their career. Lanois and Eno are back in some capacity here, but they're overshadowed by the just plain populist production team of Chris Thomas and old mainstay Steve Lillywhite, and a lazy reliance on the old-school approach dominates over any attempts to break out of the U2 mold.    This isn't to say that songs such as \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" -- both resonant of the brilliant \\"One\\" -- or \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" -- heavy on \\"The Joshua Tree\\" influences -- are devoid of charms. They're just uninspired recreations and inferior simulations of the genuine achievements that preceded them.    As Bono has made abundantly clear in reams of pre-album publicity, the title of the new disc and many of the songs were inspired by his turbulent relationship with his father, who died from cancer in 2001. This experience led him to once again ponder heavy issues such as birth, death, war, peace and the existence of the Almighty,via the album's closer and its pretentious nadir, \\"Yahweh.\\"    But the singer's musings never rise above the level of fortune-cookie proverbs, and the most honest line in any of his lyrics comes in \\"All Because of You\\" when he confesses, \\"I like the sound of my own voice.\\"    U2's defenders will say it's unfair to allow extramusical factors to taint this album, but we can't avoid the fact that the band has hit a new low with a marketing campaign that outdoes Jessica Simpson's pact with 7-Eleven. The group's ubiquitous TV commercials for Apple and the special-issue iPod containing its entire catalog are cheap, tawdry gimmicks beneath a band of this stature, and while the stars have made a point of saying they didn't take any money for the sponsorship, they certainly haven't said they'll donate their royalties or profits from the tour that begins in March to Third World debt.    Ask yourself: If U2's new music was any good, would the group need to prostitute itself in ads and on the soundtrack to that teen soap opera \\"The O.C.\\"? Would we have ever taken it seriously if it had done this sort of thing circa \\"Boy\\" or \\"October\\"?    (...)
B0002KVUKM|4.0|All said and done, this film is a tremendous amount of fun.  Director Stephen Sommers takes the stuff of our favorite fictional monsters and blends them together to create a highly imaginative reconstruction of the story of Dracula.  Resemblances to Bram Stoker's original tale are entirely accidental.  Instead we find Dracula  (Richard Roxburgh) using with Dr. Frankenstein (Samuel West) to serve some dark and nefarious purpose.  Not very far in the background is a werewolf (Will Kemp) who carries part of the answer to the puzzle - when he isn't trying to chew a hole in Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman).<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, the last living member of her family, who have been dedicated to exterminating Dracula for some 400 years.  Thanks to an oath of her forefathers, the Valerious line is condemned to purgatory as long as Dracula wanders the night.  Concerned that this curse is about to become permanent, a secret order of the Catholic Church sends in their best occult assassin - Van Helsing - aided reluctantly by Friar Carl (David Wenham), who plays the mad inventor to Van Helsing's athletic efforts.  Gabriel shows up to help Anna, is promptly rebuffed by the woman, whose mind is definitely her own.  But the action goes ballistic, and no one gets time to be banished or stomp off.<br /><br />And of action, special effects, stunts. and computer graphics there is a great muchness.  Most of which looks just believable enough to keep the audience staring open mouthed at the screen.  An outstanding job is done with Dracula's wives (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran) and the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley).  So good that these characters very nearly steal the entire show.  Sets are equally carefully crafted, with a marvelous medieval town and two whole gothic castles.  The visual impression of the film often completely overwhelms the story.<br /><br />The acting is bright, with a slightly crude, sarcastic style of interplay between the characters. The overall touch is comedic, despite the inevitable sour grapes of the ending.  Don't look for greatness here.  The point is to create an exciting, fun experience, not to recreate the dark and brooding spirit behind the originals.  Sommers does well with this tongue-in-cheek, cut-and-run style and Van Helsing proves this once againay between the characters.

Timothy Dalton is unsurpassed and dominates every scene he is in- what an outstanding and underappreciated  actor. Where is the DVD version of this masterpiece???
B000089RVX|2.0|I bought Evanescence' CD Fallen, not because of the media attention they were receiving (I'm not one to be suckered by anyone), but because of the songs that were aired on the radio, that managed to gain my favor. So when I bought the CD I wasn't sure what I was expecting. To my great dismay, Fallen is just what the title describes; an over-hyped Christian band with no more talent than Jesse McCartney. And that's saying something. Much like Arvil Lavgine, all of Evanescence best songs (Going Under, Bring me to life, Everybody's fool) are at the beginning of the compact disk save for the 12th track (My Immortal). From there the music slightly dark to heavy angst and dark subject matter in the lyrics.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The disturbing demeanor of the songs; Haunted, Tourniquet, Imaginary, Taking Over Me, Hello, My Last Breath, and Whisper so is depressing and radiates negativity in such a powerful way, my stomach turned. \\"Tourniquet\\" is especially the perfect example of a song based on Suicide in a much darker light. It makes Gothem city's Batman look pleasant to compared to it.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Somewhere in the song Amy Lee Literally shouts out \\"I want to die!\\" Then proceeds to sing the chorus \\"My God, my Tourniquet.\\" Then blatantly finishes \\"my suicide.\\" Not exactly a positive message for the children or teenagers alike. Instead of finding a band with talent and some sort of message (or at least music I could stomach) I find a reason why my parents dislike Rock (at times, I couldn't agree more with them). These songs will leave you feeling depressed and wondering what kind of Christian or any human being could listen to this; but if your the kind that aren't easily swayed by warnings, you'll be sure to listening to this CD for years to come. But if not, be sure to think twice before buying this CD; if you don't, well.... you aren't going to get your money back.------- [A 2 out of 5]
B0002YLC24|5.0|Richard Linklater's films contain some of the best dialogue I've ever heard on screen (e.g. Dazed and Confused, Waking Life), and this is one of his best. Unlike most sequels, this one is actually as good as the original, Before Sunrise, which is an accomplishment in itself. Both of these films capture an intense connection between two people that is romantic, intellectual and life-altering. Before Sunrise is about two young people, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who meet and fall in love aboard a train in Europe. After spending one very intense day together, they part and promise to meet later in Vienna. That film ends with the future of their relationship left uncertain. Now, nine years later, Before Sunset brings them back together. Jesse has written a book based on their encounter, and Celine shows up at his book signing in Paris. They walk around the city and discuss everything from politics to religion to their love lives.<br /><br />In most romantic movies, the dialogue consists of clever or funny words that the characters use to seduce each other and the audience. In this film, however, like its predecessor, these people actually have ideas about life, society and other things that stray beyond the scope of most popular entertainment. This will make the film tedious to some. Yet Before Sunset rises above the limits of some dialogue-centered films, which often come across as stage plays. The variety of issues that Jesse and Celine discuss, the way their moods shift, and the scenic background provided by the city combine to create a depth that prevents the film from being simply \\"talky.\\"  More importantly, the actors do a superb job in building emotional tension as the conversation slips gradually from general topics into the characters' intense feelings for each another, which they are at first reluctant to reveal. Before Sunset has a focus that is very specific regarding two people but also very insightful about universal concerns. Both Hawke and Delpy give  extremely natural performances; they, along with Linklater, are credited with writing the screenplay, which I suspect was partly improvised.  I especially liked the ending, which is both perfect and avoids being a cliche, no small feat in a romance.ke and Delpy give  extremely natural performances; they, along with Linklater, are credited with writing the screenplay, which I suspect was partly improvised.

0553573403|5.0|I don't give out 5 stars lightly.  I think this book, and the series as a whole, is simply the best epic fantasy anyone has ever written.  Wonderful characterization; bad guys who are bad but nonetheless sympathetic.  All delicous shades of grey.  Fantasy for a mature audience that can appreciate characters with all the complexity of real people.
B0006399FS|2.0|And thats a bad thing. This album is a letdown on a multitude of levels, first of all, the production: much, much too clean. It sounds like a damn Phil Collins record. Alot of these other reviewers say that U2 has gone too pop, and I agree with that to an extent, but they've always been a pop band, for better or worse, but at least they were writing better songs 20 years ago. Whats with these lyrics about smelly baby body parts and waiting for someones crumbs? Give me a break Bono. This is the man who once sang about broken bottles under childrens feet and dead bodies all over the street, and now we're being subjected to these trite, meaningless lyrics. I own about 20 or 25 U2 cds (including compilations and singles)but its very hard for me to say whether or not I consider this a worthwhile addition to my collection. Even though POP was based in electronics, it felt so much more \\"human\\" than this album does. To all those people who think this ranks in U2's upper echelon of albums, think again. There are no thought-provoking lyrics here, no captivating political statements, no fascinating muses on God, the afterlife, war, poverty, finding ones self, or finding love in someone else. The U2 of 20 years ago had all of these qualities, and honestly, I miss that band.
0451196716|3.0|I'm a Stephen King fan, but this book fell short of my expectations.  The story was captivating until I reached the end when I realized that none of my questions were going to be answered.  I was left confused, empty, and angry that the reader wasn't given more.  I would have given this one star, but the cold horror that is Stephen King is present and doesn't disappoint in that respect.  But overall, it's a disappointment.    I've read many Stephen King books and this is one of his worst.  Also, is he capable of writing a story that takes place outside of Maine?  Apparently not.  Although I've never been to Maine, I'm already bored of the place.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium happens to be one of my greatest movies of all time. The action sequence and camera work of this movie are terrific. During the fighting scenes the camera stays at one angle while Christian Bale (Cleric) does his gun-fu, which is a very fascinating fighting style to see. The director of this film did a great job, the story line had some plot holes but don't they all? If you're a matrix fan or not, or if you ever got dizzy from watching Bourne-Supremacy, this is a great buy!
0446677450|4.0|Realize that these books are Self Improvement books rather than Financial How-To's. If you think the former, you'll see how great they are for giving the average working middle-class person a whole new way of thinking. If you see these books as the latter, you'll be disappointed.  This book, and others in the family, are great for instilling the courage into us average folk to make big financial moves. They're not number-crunching revelations. Take these books with the right attitude, and they'll do you much good.
B000669GAI|5.0|First off, this is a great best of for one of the best straight out rock bands of the past ten years.  I was a little wary of having one disc loud and one disc more ballad-like, but it really works quite well.  Sure, there are some great songs missing, especially from the later years, but when you've already got two discs filled to the brim, you're really maxing out the 'best of' concept already.<br /><br />  What the devoted fan needs here are the remixes of the songs from \\"Ten.\\"  \\"Ten\\"'s always been my least-favorite PJ album because of the glossy late 80's-early 90's sound.  The Brendan O'Brien remixes really bring out the best in the songs.  The drums are much more live sounding and the guitars sound jagged and ragged, just like every other PJ album.  I really hope this is a teaser for a full blown \\"Ten\\" remix.
B0006399FS|5.0|HTDAAB gets better with each listen. Upon first hearing the full CD (including, on iTunes, \\"Fast Cars\\") HTDAAB appeared massive, multilayered... a passionate U2 work of art that revealed its layers over time. \\"Yahweh\\" never took off for me until I saw them perform it, opening night in San Diego.    Having seen the San Diego and Seattle shows, and having had the opportunity to hear almost every single one of these songs live and in the context of greats such as \\"Bad,\\" \\"Streets,\\" \\"Zoo Station,\\" \\"The Electric Co.\\" it's clear that HTDAAB is packed full of the elements I've loved about U2 for 25 years and at the same time is the sound of a band that refuses to rest on its laurels.    As much as I've enjoyed the single \\"Vertigo,\\" it took on whole new life once I saw them play it live. In fact, \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Love and Peace or Else,\\" \\"All Because of You,\\" and yes, even \\"Miracle Drug\\" are concert greats that leave the audience exhilarated and the band totally amped up.     As a fan going back to 1981 I could say that this may rank up with \\"Joshua\\" and \\"ATYCLB\\" as one of my favorite all-time U2 releases.    Last night I got the opportunity to hear Bono sing \\"Sometimes,\\" as he pulled a 10-year-old boy up onto the ellipse with him and walk hand-in-hand with the child. It was a spellbinding allusion to the subject matter of the song-- the child facing the father within himself and seeing his own shortcomings even as he faces the parent. It brought tears to the eyes of many in the crowd and reminded me of what happened in 1987 when U2 did \\"Running to Stand Still\\" and \\"Mothers of the Disappeared.\\" Today they reach the heart as easily as they did 20 years ago, and with as much or more force. And when they tear into \\"Vertigo\\" they can still blow the roof off the place.    U2 is genius, and without a CD as brilliant as HTDAAB to tour behind they'd merely be a greatest-hits act going through the motions. Anyone who can't hear that in these songs is just soooooo missing out.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 will probably never quite be on the cutting edge again.  But they seemed to have found a perfect groove for their middle age.  Much like Bowie has done on his last two albums,  U2 is now content with recombining sounds from their previous albums to create quality new songs.  While this won't create anything spectacularly new, it's a fine way to keep up a long term career in rock.  Most of the music here does evoke earlier songs (maybe too much with \\"Miracle Drug\\") but there are few misses here (\\"Yahweh\\" comes to mind as a failed song).  The rockers here seem to do best, and \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" are top shelf U2.  U2's adventurousness may be lost forever, but maybe adventurousness is for the younger bands.  In their roll as rock statesmen, U2 are doing well.

The first night he spent a long time making car and bus and firetruck sounds along the \\"road\\".

B0006399FS|4.0|At last, they released new material.  I can't wait to have their new record, but I am not convinced that this record was stolen as what they were saying before.  I think it was more on controversy that's why they did that, but on the other hand, they made a great album.  Worth to buy....
B00065U08Q|5.0|Sphere in the Heart of Silence is more of a electronic-techno album, but it is still great! I bought this album today at Borders and listened to it in my car on the way home. It reminds me of To Record Water for Only Ten Days (at least some of the drums do). Josh Klinghoffer sings more on this album, which is is good if you enjoy his vocals. If you are John Frusciante or Josh Klinghoffer fan get this album, it is the different when compared to all the other albums released, but it is still great!!!!
0375704027|5.0|In number9dream, David Mitchell as much as admits that Norwegian Wood was the inspiration for his novel. I can see why. This postmodern coming-of-age novel is probably the most powerful and elegantly told novel of its kind short of The Catcher in the Rye.

It may be \\"just a love story\\" as some complain, but it is the most interesting and fascinating love story and coming of age story I have ever read. I love this book.
B000002P5W|5.0|This is truly Jimi Hendrix at his best. He goes a little softer and bluesier than his debut album, \\"Are You Experienced,\\" and loses some of the speaker-blasting guitar riffs from the early days of Purple Haze and Foxey Lady in place for more heartfelt tunes like \\"Little Wing\\" and the title track, \\"Bold As Love,\\" as well as some touching lyrics on  \\"Castles Made of Sand\\", and of course the ultimate chill-out sounds of the opening number, \\"Up From the Skies,\\" and also \\"If 6 Was 9\\".<br /><br />But don't be discouraged Purple Haze fanatics, Hendrix can still blow out your headphones.

0446310786|4.0|This is a truly great novel. It's well-written, engrossing, poignant, and takes on a lot of the big issues from growing up to racism to fear and ignorance. It is at once complex in its themes yet simple to understand. As a result, it doesn't have that sense of deep untertone and vast implications one often associates with great literature. I respect Harper Lee's achievement in writing a true and important classic. At the same time, I often find myself drawn to more challenging works. I'm glad I read it--I liked it--but it didn't give me that feeling of a mental workout that I usually seek.

This is a must-have CD for anyone that appreciates true talent, great singing, incredible writing talent and music that stirs your soul.<br />Delta's first CD was nothing short of incredible.  And her follow-up, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" is every bit the equal to her freshman entry into the music world.<br />Her writing, as her music stylings, have grown with the two years since her first release and yet she still remains very true to what brought her to the dance, or the piano in this case.

B0006399FS|1.0|Amigos, me siento horriblemente humillado por este comercial de Televisin de 48 minutos titulado How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. U2 han cado en lo ms bajo de toda su carrera artstica, privilegiando la reafirmacin del ego personal, la fama y el dinero por sobre toda inquietud artstica. Este album se nota que fue compuesto durante All That You Can't Live Behind, las canciones tienen el mismo estilo, con ms sonido y guitarras quizs, pero todo el resto es el mismo. Vertigo es la prueba de cmo es el album, si bien la cancin no tiene nada que ver con el resto del disco, s tiene que ver en el sentido del apronte excesivamente comercial y calculado del album, hecho slo para vender y vender ms copias. Con esto U2 insultan preferentemente a aquellos fans ms antiguos, que los han seguido por 10, 15 e incluso 20 aos. No existe profundidad alguna en este disco, las canciones son entendidas como singles separados, rompiendo cualquier posible unin en el disco. Con ello este album se puede escuchar una y otra vez, pero pierde todo intento de innovacin, de rompimiento de esquemas, etc. La edicin limitada haba sido un adelanto de esto, ya que el libro de 48 pginas decepcion profundamente a todos los fans, puesto a que no traa letras, fotos, historias, declaraciones interesantes, nada, slo dibujos y mensajes escritos a mano, ms un DVD de relleno sin material interesante. Ahora el album sale a la venta, manteniendo la misma filosofa de la edicin limitada...dinero. As es, U2 renunciaron a lo que ellos mismos haban creado, aquella banda vanguardista e innovadora, para transformarse en una empresa musical con fines de lucro. Lamentable U2, la decadencia es inminente.
0440238609|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone with any sense of an imagination.  They are the type of books that take you right where the characters are. It is as if you are in a completely different world when you open them.  It is one of the most suspensful trilogies i've ever read, and i sincerely recommend these books to other teens.  These far beat any of the Harry Potter books. A Definate Must-Read!!
B000000OA6|5.0|Your Worst Nightmare is a dumbass. He wouldn't know real music if it was a bug up his ass!<br /><br />This is the true last Queen album, and definately one of their best. This goes to show that Queen were always on top of their game, and they went out with a bang. Queen were on their way back on top of the music world, but unfortuantely Freddie passed away. Innuendo finds Queen back to where they started...playing hard rock, and drifting away from their 'pop' thing. This is definately one of their top four albums, and this should be one that you should have by this fantastic group.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Here is the essence of why this film is a rare gem:  it portrays High School Misfits as they actually are.  When I was in high school, the \\"nerds\\" and \\"dweebs\\" were not like the Hollywood stereotypes...you know, really smart, eager to please the \\"jocks\\" by doing their homework for them, into computers, etc...the sterotype that began with Revenge of the Nerds and never died.  No, the bottom feeders in my school were like Nappy D.  They just didn't look right.  They weren't eager to please, they were irratable & antagonistic, like Napoleon.  They did weird things (Napoleon throws an action figure on a string out the bus window;  I remember a kid who walked around in the halls making truck noises).  No, this is the perfect embodiment of what it is like to be a teenage nothing, and how in their world, everything is OK.
B0002KVULG|4.0|John Badham's \\"Dracula\\" varies quite a bit from both the stage play that was its direct inspiration (as well as Todd Browning's 1931 version that starred Bela Lugosi)and Stoker's novel. \\"Dracula\\" manages to be both gothic romance and gothic horror story all in one well scripted and directed package. None of \\"Dracula\\" takes place in Transylvania. W. D. Richter cleverly weaves elements of Stoker's novel, the play and his own original concepts into a fascinating tale.<br /><br />Solicitor Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve) has arranged for Count Dracula to purchase an old estate near Carfax Abbey. The old run down estate seems an odd choice but it seems it was exactly what the Count was looking for. When the schooner carrying Dracula is destroyed off the coast of Whitby, the only survivor is the Count. He befriends Harker, Dr. Seward (Donald Pleasance) who runs the local asylum, Seward's daughter Lucy (Kate Nelligan)and Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis). Dracula finds a soulmate in Lucy and intends to take her for his own despite the fact that she's engaged to Harker. Mina dies due to anemia and her father Professor Van Helsing (Olivier)comes to claim the body. He recognizes how she died and who did it almost immediately setting in motion a battle for Lucy's immortal soul.<br /><br />I never saw Langela perform this on stage but his charisma, sexuality and presence translate well to the screen. He portrays Dracula with a touch of weariness as well as a sense of loss. The stellar cast has a number of outstanding performances including that of Kate Nelligan and the superb Donald Pleasance. While Olivier gives an outstanding performance as Dracula's nemesis Van Helsing, I can imagine how the drama would have worked better with a younger, more atheletic Van Helsing (not to dissimilar from Peter Cushing's dashing performance in Hammer's \\"Horror of Dracula\\").<br /><br />The transfer looks exceptional crisp, clear and the sound has tremendous presence. There are those that complained about how the film, despite the fact that it is in color, looks almost black and white. I seem to recall that the colors, although vibrant at times, were muted throughout most of the movie when I saw it in theaters although not to the great degree seen here. Evidently John Badham went back and had Universal adjust the color yet again prior to the DVD release. Regardless, it doesn't effect the overall clarity or sharpness of the image but be warned that this might not be the way you remember it. John Williams musical score sound terrific and has all the color that has been drained from the film.<br /><br />There's a retrospective documentary entitled \\"The Revamping of Dracula\\", a photo gallery and a thoughtful commentary track by director Badham. Langela appears in the documentary on the making of \\"Dracula\\" and we actually see stills from the Broadway production featuring him as well in it. Langela comments on how ill Olivier was during shooting (and, in fact, a lot of scenes have his stand in for medium and long shots due to his illness). Badham comments on how Pleasance frequently stole scenes from his co-stars (Langela heard about it the day before he was to shoot his first scene with him). We also hear about why he used the lasers in some sequences. It's a terrific documentary although I would have liked to hear interviews with some of the other surviving actors although we get some interesting comments from producer Walter Mirisch and writer W. D. Richter (\\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\"). Richter's comments about some of the changes he made compare to the play are interesting (particularly the change to the line \\"Listen to them...the children of the night..what SAD music they make\\"). The photo gallery is also quite good.<br /><br />Universal has done a fine job in this DVD reissue although some fans of the film may not like the muted colors for this DVD release. The extras and commentary by director Badham provided interesting observations on the making of thefilm. Sporting a anamorphic widescreen transfer (which translates to higher lines of resolution, hence better picture), \\"Dracula\\" looks exceptionally good despite some of the changes that Badham made to the film.film.

0316666343|4.0|I've been intrigued by the plot of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" ever since hearing about it, but only recently got around to reading it.  While many have said how original the premise is for the book to be narrated by a character already dead, stories have been narrated by dead main characters in almost any venue of storytelling.  Nevertheless, Sebold introduces characters and a story that is vivdly drawn and uniquely told.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" examines the aftermath of a young girl's murder.  Sebold deftly analyzes the effect of the Susie Salmon's death on her parents, her sister and brother, the boy who was in love with her, and her killer.  We watch them struggle with her disappearance, and learn the ins and outs of what it takes for each family member to survive.  Her mother cannot cope and feels the need to escape, while her father relentlessly pursues the killer with no shred of evidence as to his guilt.  All the while, we are being told the story through the eyes of the murdered Susie, resting uneasily in a heaven that she sculpts from her own wishes.  Yet her most constant wish, to be reunited with those she loves, is impossible to grant - or is it?  The reader watches these characters grow through Susie's ever present vigil, and wait expectedly for how this story may possibly have a somewhat happy ending.<br /><br />Sebold's storytelling is vivid and quick-paced.  The Salmon family are funny and heartwrenching at the same time.  The pain of Sebold's own personal demons have found catharsis through the praising of Susie's life.  Yet I found myself rather disappointed with the ending.  After such a tremendous build-up, of grieving with this family immediately after Susie's death, I felt that the end was rushed.  And even though justice is never perfect, or perfectly served, there were some loose ends that seemed to rush too fast for some climactic, miraculous event.  I wish that Sebold had keep to the pace set by the beginning of the novel, and hadn't shortchanged the ending.tchanged the ending.
0553277472|4.0|I first read this book as a junior in high school, which is probably to young of an age to really understand much of what the book explores. Subsequently, I've reread the book on two occassions.   My review of the book is simple. For those who are interested in an exploration on the nature of thought and philosophy and a willingness to explore human intellect, than much of the book will resonate with you. For many, it is a book that you will willingly re-read.    For those with zero interest in the subject, save your money for something else.
B0006399FS|2.0|Ever since Joshua Tree/Rattle and Hum, U2 has been going downhill.  I didn't like Auchtung Baby (CHEESY lyrics bad style).  When Zooropa came out, it was worse than Auchtung Baby.  Brian Eno helped with that sorry excuse of an album: Passengers (which at least made Auchtung Baby and Zooropa look respectable by comparison).  Pop had some decent stuff and wasn't as \\"sell-out\\" as Auchtung Baby.  All That You Can't Leave Behind had some decent tracks.  But this album may be the worse of all albums since Rattle And Hum (well, nothing is worse than Passengers).  I bought the CD/DVD/Book thing because the CD in this deluxe package had 12 tracks instead of 11.   I'm not sure what's worse, the book or the CD.  They both could be done by a  S L O W  4th grader.  I was very disappointed with this album.  For those curious of my criticality, I have every CD, single, DVD, VHS tape, bootleg, book, etc. that is U2 related.  If you like Electrical Storm (and I really did), consider that not a single song on this CD is 1/2 as good as that before buying it...
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|about this magnificant all around movie.  The performances were brillant, the plot was sublime and the the visual imagery was spellbinding.  On the surface, this movie is a magical fairytale of one man's life.  That alone was fascinating and draws the viewer in from the start.  But at the core, it is the timeless story of a father-son relationship.  The father is a man who struggles to obtain his goal of \\"greatness\\" and the son is a man whose disappointment in own his father, because he can't or won't be the type of father he wants, obscures the real value of having this man as his father until it is almost too late.  An extremely emotional movie that grabs you from the beginning and thoroughly wrings you out by the end.  It makes you re-evaluate your own life and family dynamics.  I highly recommend this movie!  Just be prepared to deal with the aftermath.......  A truly beautiful story told beautifully.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought it after hearing part of defying gravity from a friends and fell in love immediatly. The music is a brilliant turn by stephan schwartz, known for his neverending musical lines. Kristen Chenoweth is hilarious as Glinda, and I haven't even seen the show, the CD makes me giggle. And Idina Menzel, that woman has amazing vocal power, anyone who can belt Defying Gravity after already belting the entire first act deserves her Tony over and over. And then to come back and do it again in the second. Every time I listen to defying gravity I am insprired. And now I can't stop listening. I have converted my family and roomate over to Wicked fans. All it takes is one time through. This is Broadway at it's best. With two of Broadway's rising stars, who could ask for anything more.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I thought the newest Harry Potter movie was VERY WELL DONE. A new look for an ever changing story line. Why would anyone want to watch a movie thats done exactly like the first two? Change it up a bit and keep the audiance wondering how their favorite books are going to be brought to screen. It doesnt hurt to have many peoples different views bring a great book to screen in another way then the first two. As long as the story gets told, isnt that all that matters?
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Sure, it's full of self-serving crap but they were all really into it...some to do good; some not wanting to be left out. I had it on tape off my satelite dish until the tape was lost and I am thrilled that I can get it on DVD. Included is the very BEST live performance by Eric Clapton ever. No fooling. The best. <br /> <br />Don't cry too much about Led Zep not being on it. Their mikes weren't hooked up during the original and Robert Plant sounded like a cat caught in a window fan. Jimmie Page looked like he was being squeezed. The best part survived. Be grateful that you get to see it.
B0006399FS|5.0|After four years, U2 have released their 11th studio album called \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\" It has the elements of any great U2 production, the addictive singles which get you jumped up, the signature ballads, and of course the songs which you can appreciate but take time to grow on you. These seasoned veterans have been in the game for about 25 years now, but they still have that youthful energy which makes so many people passionate about their music. After many listens, I think the new album stands above any of their 90's work, except maybe \\"Achtung Baby\\"  <br /> <br />VERTIGO: first single and flat out rocking, Bono soars and Edge's slashing guitar are as hard as ever (4.5/5)  <br />MIRACLE DRUG: wonderful piece of work, up there with u2's greatest. classic guitar and great lyrics (5/5)  <br />SOMETIMES: good ballad which is still growing on me. good, but not great, but it is very emotional (3/5)  <br />LOVE AND PEACE OR ELSE: another rocker, a very different side or U2. sounds like something off the pop album, very good though, and the guitar work is insane (4/5)  <br />CITY OF BLINDING LIGHTS: a future single for the band, very long with great lyrics and driving bass (4.5/5)  <br />ALL BECAUSE OF YOU: has that old school rock feeling to it, another highlight for edge, who has a wicked guitar solo fired up by bono's classic yelling (4/5)  <br />A MAN AND A WOMAN: a grower which really hasn't grown on me, U2 trying to do a R&B song and it doesn't work for me (3/5)  <br />CRUMBS FROM YOUR TABLE: probably one of the most complete songs, has great lyrics and vocals by bonovox, and great guitar work by edge (4.5/5)  <br />ONE STEP CLOSER: another grower which did grow on me. very understated but at the same time has a big effect (4/5)  <br />ORIGINAL OF THE SPECIES: the beatles, sorry, u2, do epic and it works out perfectly (5/5)  <br />YAHWEH: very positive closer which sums up the album as a whole (3.5/5)  <br /> <br />When it's all said and done, U2 willgo down as one of the greatest bands to ever exist. \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" captures the maturity of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" takes snippets from the experiments of \\"Pop,\\" and finally continues the tradition of youthful energy of \\"Boy.\\" A release us U2 fans will be very satisfied with, and we will follow...
B00005JMAH|5.0|The first two films were good -- its always great to see a fairly accurate interpretation of a book. But watching the Columbus films was like eating an angel-food cake: beautiful to look at and it all tastes great, but light and fluffy and not too substantive. Columbus made the Home Alone films, which looked pretty but were weak on story. This movie, however, was exciting and dangerous. Instead of trying to squeeze every last detail of the book into a marathon movie, Cuaron decided to focus on the story itself. The pace and imagery made the entire film feel like a roller coaster ride, with the viewer strapped in beside the main characters. Even though I knew the outcome of the story, I was enthralled and surprised at all of the right places. This movie is definitely darker and more \\"witchy\\" -- which is kind of what I had hoped would be the case for the first two films.<br /><br />Altogether, Cuaron did an excellent job with this film, and I look forward to seeing his name attached to other Harry Potter films.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm sorry to say that but I remember when I was living in NY seeing two anarchists being spanked by four policemen inside Penn Station, NY, just because they were distributing some fliers that questioned the legitimacy of the American voting system. The beating was as brutal as it would be in any third-world dictatorship. The fliers were confiscated and the two men arrested. That was the year of 1988. 18 years have passed and nothing changed: you do have a dictator as president, who employs the same brainwash routines used by his kind all over the world. Going to war is one of them. Patriotism is another one. And all of that in the name of goodness and God. The most absurd thing is not to realize that the terrorists only exist because of the American foreign policy over the years. Why did they blow WTC out, not the Eiffel Tower? The answer is as simple as it is absurd people keep voting for him hoping that USA can be free of terrorism. Collecting hate from all over the world is not a wise policy towards this goal. Moore's works are trying to reveal the evil inside and all around Bush. I suggest him making a movie about how the world sees USA today. We can't be wrong: we are billions against 59,459,765 voters. And we have 49% of the American voters on our side. All of that makes Fahrenheit 9/11 the most important movie and book of its time. Despite some very naive and emotional comments that smell like old left wing propaganda...

B0006399FS|5.0|For most of my life, if you asked me who was the greatest rock-n-roll band, I would've said the Stones.  Jagger-Richards from, oh, 1967-1980 would still hold that title.  With their new release, however, U2 shows that they have wrested the title away from the Stones, who unfortunately seem like a bit of a nostalgia act in comparison. With this release, U2 shows that \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was no fluke; Bono and the Edge have recovered from their Electronica hipster dabbling and have returned to making vital rock'n'roll.<br />\\"Vertigo\\" is one of a long tradition of opening rockers that will surely open the concerts next year and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own is the best slow U2 tune since \\"One\\".  It is the three closing tracks that seal the deal:  \\"One Step Closer\\" is haunting; \\"Original of the Species\\" is instantly memorable and unbelievably catchy, like no U2 song I've ever heard, with its Sgt.Pepper/Abbey Road type bridge; and \\"Yahweh\\", an appealingly direct hymn, is the best U2 closer in years.  Long may they reign...
B0006399FS|1.0|I simply don't understand this hype concept, you know, Bono's words repeated again and again with any new album. This album is simply awful, showing a big shyness to make whole new music. Rather, this album is safe, weak and boring. Isn't something interesting and worth listen. By far the more interesting thing here is something new after 4 years, but sadly is not 100% at all. This hits factory intended bother me, really. Where is exploration here ? where is excellence here ? where is innovation here ? rather, here I found exasperating evasive music exit for hits and money. U2 have park their car on the safe world of commercial singles, forgetting to communicate what happen in the present world, living in a cloud of fame and pleasure. <br />This album overall is nothing but a terrible mistake fed by desire on more fame and more money. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is so boring, predictable, disposable and accessible.
B0006399FS|5.0|Those of you who know what real rock music is, know that the junk on the radio today is NOT IT, save a few classics and exceptions.  This album is a WAKE UP CALL to the entire world reaffirming what GOOD MUSIC is.  Sure, there are plenty other GREAT rock bands out there.  U2 is one of them.  U2 has created a deep, important, quality CD here, and those who hate it have lost sight of what important music means and sounds like.  Buy this CD if you want emotional, uplifting, and important music.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This is Journey's best line up yet.  If you haven't seen this DVD yet you are missing out, let me tell you.  Jon, Deen, Steve, Neal and Ross are at their best.  And a certain someone is wearing some steaming hot red leather pants!!!
B000002UAX|5.0|I don't think it's possible for any group of musicians to ever come anywhere near The Beatles. This album is one of the most cleverly done that i've ever heard, where the messages come flying fast, and you have to be fast to keep up. If you are in the right frame of mind, it will blow you away, and you will never listen to any music the same way again. The same goes for all of their later work. I won't bother describing individual songs or moments, there are too too many high points here. A towering album, and a mind altering listening experience.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Its one of the few I've seen multiple times in theaters (and a couple of times at my friends house).  The movie is pretty much build up of several scenes that can stand alone.  All of the characters are lovable and remind you of the folks you went to high school with; the extremely dorky and socially retarded Napoleon, his pal Pedro with the coolest and most suave accent ever, and the weird-ass 80's girl Deb, the over-confident jockstrap who's name I can't remember, and Hillary Duff's sister. All in all the movie is awesome.  Buy it and give it to me for Christmas. <br />
6304708521|5.0|Yes kids, The Beatles had a very sarcastic, kind of twisted sense of humor. You will have to consider this when you see the film. I find parts of it hilarious. And the music sequences make it worthwhile. Also, it was made in 1967, and is definitly of it's time. Not for everyone, but for fans it is a must see.
B0006399FS|3.0|Well, sometimes is better to be quiet and not talk to much, isn't it Bono ?. How many times have you listen any artist saying \\"this will be the best record ever made\\" and things like that before ?. Since Pop, in 1997, U2 has used to say the same thing to their new album, and that the reason why I didn't believe at all those wonderful Bono's words about this new album. I have so many ideas about reviewing this album, so I have to order in my mind now...well, here I go.  <br /> <br />First, an overall review, and second, a song by song one.  <br /> <br />This album is near 50 minutes long, intended as a \\"singles album\\", not as a concept album or any other art form. So, to some extent, is pretty ATYCLB ( one of the worst U2 albums ever ), that's quite dissapointing. I don't know why U2 can't make a more art and interesting album, with so many things happening now, like War on Iraq, some U.S scandals like Torture on Iraq, relationship between Saudi Arabian and Bin Laden's family, civil war in some countries in Africa, Mid East, the fall of United Nations after Bush's wish to go war, etc.  <br />Is bassicaly a nice collection of songs, but quite empty and lack of deep, interesting and unexpected moments, etc. Sometimes is pure Rock, and sometimes in slower. Is not Techno at all, also isn't Punk at all. The overall sound is flat, I mean, if you compare ( for example ) Bono's voice sound is pretty the same on every song, unlike many truly awesome records like Radiohead Ok Computer, Pink Floyd The Wall, Led Zeppelin IV, John Lennon Plastic Ono Band. Sound mixer wasn't very smart. The same thing happen with Edge's guitars, when they're distorded sound pretty the same on every distorded chords, and then they're delayed, sound pretty the same too. By the way, Edge is not so creative on this album, I mean, all his guitars are great ( like always ) but you can't find his whole new guitars used on Boy, Unforgettable Fire or Acthung Baby. Many guitars sounds like ATYCLB. Larry's drums and Adam's bass are really filler !!!, I mean, you can't find any such a classic bass like Pink Floyd Money or Another Brick In The Wall, any classic drumming like The Police Message In A Bottle or Roxanne, etc. Truly bad, they seem to be just a boring musicians, without any ideas. The whole album are just Bono, The Edge and some keyboards and strings.  <br />After listening the whole album, is clear Bono's voice will never returned back to Zoo TV times. Is pretty the same singing than ATYCLB, sadly, that's the true. You can realize how he has to \\"fight\\" with his voice to reach higher notes.  <br />For my overall view, my rating is no more than 6/10.  <br /> <br />Song By Song:  <br /> <br />1- Vertigo: Just a commercial Rock song, nothing more. Absolutely empty and pointless song, silly lyrics, flat sound, etc. The Jacknife Remix has so much interesting moments than the \\"master\\" version. Bono's voice should have sounded like Jacknife Remix. Also is a short song, just intended for a hit single. You can't find any deep messages on this song. 5/10  <br /> <br />2- Miracle Drug: What an improvement !!! The best song of the album. Great melodies, great guitars, Bono's voice at the best of the whole album. Is a mid-tempo song, and will be a classic.  <br />10/10  <br /> <br />3- Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own: A typical mid album song, and pretty ATYCLB one. Is very nice, a ballad, with many high guitars and almost no drumming. Nothing to compare with classic ballads like All I Want Is You, One or With Or Without You. Bono's voice is pretty crappy. 5/10  <br /> <br />4- Love And Peace Or Else: What the hell is this ? is this U2 trying to make Pink Floyd's Money or what ?. If that so, they should have done those awesome and classic Gilmour's guitars. A really filler song, the worst of the whole album. Skip the track, the song turns boring and boring. For the first time, Edge is wrong with his guitars, except on the middle \\"quiet\\" part. The only good thing isthe ending, should have been longer and with a real guitar solo. Again, Bono's voice should have sounded different. What a crap was the sound mixer !!.3/10  <br /> <br />5- City Of Blinding Lights: Again, another classic of the album. Beautiful song, really great and worth listen. I love it, really love it. Most of the time, when Bono and Edge sing the chorus is something unforgettable and great. That piano like Boy times is cool. Bono sounds far better not trying to reach those impossible high notes for him. The longer song of the album and one of the best. Well done U2. 10/10  <br /> <br />6- All Because Of You: Nice song, so many guitars, between acoustic and electric ones !!. Another song singing in a dual voice style, cool and fresh. The ending is pretty Rattle & Hum song. I know you'll like it. 9/10  <br /> <br />7- A Man And A Woman: Unlike the previous song, this song stars pretty simple in its instruments. Is one of the most different song of the album. Nice instruments, except for boring Larry's drumming...why he is so lazy on this album ?. I think it would have been better a somewhat Peter Gabriel's drumming programming.  <br />The song is really good, but in this version turns somewhat boring, really. 7/10  <br /> <br />8- Crumbs For Your Table: Another dual voice style song, also another highlight moment on the album. Edge's guitars lead the song, and AGAIN Larry and Adam are so lazy...please guys, if you can't play better than this, leave the band and give a chance for younger and far better drummers and bass players !!!. Another \\"long\\" song ( if long is 5 minutes running ). Another song could have sounded pretty different, but is still good. Remains me to some extent ATYCLB Walk On. 8/10  <br /> <br />9- One Step Closer: The 3rd quite song ( since A Man And A Woman ) makes the album less interesting, really. Basically, a Keyboards song, with almost no drums and few guitars. Another low point of the album, a filler song. 3/ 10  <br /> <br />10- Original Of The Species: Many chords used on this song, that's weird, because sometimes is great and sometimes is bad. In The chorus is great, anyway, as well during verses, but in the brigde is bad. Overall is another quite song, making the B-side of HTDAAB clearly lower than the A-Side. Again, Edge's guitars are the best of the song. 6/ 10  <br /> <br />11- Yahweh: After 4 songs somewhat boring if you listen one after another, this one could have put between those ones. Is the last song of the album and ( again ) is a dual voice style. Nice song, but is not a classic. Bono's voice is not his best. Is not an ending like All I Want Is You or Love Is Blindness. When I'm listening this song, I want to put again the highest points of the record, Miracle Drug and City Of Blinding Lights.  <br />6/ 10  <br /> <br />Now is your choice to buy it, but one thing I'm sure of: this is NOT the U2's masterpiece, unlike what Bono said. Is nice, but is not their best
B0000DJZA5|5.0|One thing for certain kids, it does sound alot more clear than the original album, and is tighter in feel. I like it. Paul Mccartney and Ringo Starr certainly have earned the right to have this re-done if they desire, and it is a better album without all the overdone arrangements. Now, let's have a DVD of the film, with lot's of extras.
0393035158|4.0|When young people -- say, age 15-25 -- are intelligent, they start looking for spiritual options, usually in the form of religions they weren't brought up with. \\"The End of Faith\\" is about the sweetest alternative to those alternatives. Sam Harris shows how one can replace institutionalized wishful thinking (a.k.a. mass hysteria) with one's own gracious thoughts, elegant reasoning, and basking in the glories of a universe that is laid out before our very eyes.    Bill Maher once quipped, \\"Religion is a neurological disorder.\\" \\"The End of Faith\\" proves it. It also shows you the answer to Life's Ultimate Question: being kind whenever possible is the highest moral calling.
B00003CXB7|4.0|It didn't strike me as that funny. None of the actors were comedians 'cept for Roger Bowen (Henry Blake). The massively interwoven stories-plotline bothers me more than it delights. Donald Sutherland has been totally outclassed and outperformed by Alan Alda (Hawk on tv MASH). I find it dated, a little wrongheaded in it's anti-USmilitary views (but hey it was the late 1960's), and better than any movie since after the year 1984. I do not think this film was as improvised as one poster here thinks.
B00042YBTK|5.0|When I was a teen visiting England, my uncle played this album and I fell in love with it. After much searching I located it as a young adult, but my record player gave up the ghost so I was without it for many years. I was thrilled to discover it had been remastered and released on this CD.<br /><br />Music is very subjective. And this is definately a work that you are either passionate about or think HUH? I just love it.<br /><br />When I got this CD and put it on and heard it again for the first time in years I cried!<br /><br />Colored Rain, River Deep Mountain High, and Ring of Fire are just incredible. Eric Burdon moves my soul!<br /><br />This remastered recording is outstanding.

B00005U11Z|5.0|I'm in danger of wearing this DVD out it is played so much. <br />This is, by far, the best Journey have ever been. I have followed them for over 20 years and they have held this line up for 6 years. The energy and enthusiasm exudes from the stage you cannot fail to be drawn in. The quality of the recording reproduces an exceptional live atmosphere. Neal Schon is superb and acrobat on guitar, Ross Valory a solid and technical bass player, Jonathon Cain a master on keyboard, Deen Castonovo has electrified the band with his energy and sings too and finally Steve Augeri has complimented this band with warmth in his voice that can be felt from the back row. They are superb. It's a must have for any Rock fan's DVD collection.  <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Then you are truly insane. Its one of U2's great albums of all. Right up there with Actung Baby, WAR, and The Joshua Tree. So people have been talking down 'Original Of The Species' which is so ridiculous since its the best song on the album. What it comes down to is if you do not recognize U2 as the greatest band of this era you should be put away for a very long time. They ARE the Beatles of the last 25 years.
B000003AEB|5.0|...Besides, dre's chronic, other snoop's doggfather, i find snoop doggy dogg's  \\"Doggystyle\\" his best cd and most impressive todate and im a huge fan of snoop's music and have always supported him even when he went with no limit even tho i dont like  no limit. All i gotta say is that if your into great bumpin loud bass music? Buy snoop Doggy Dogg's \\"Doggystyle\\" & you won't be dissapointed.

B00000K0DT|5.0|I can't get over it. This is probably one of the most intelligent films ever made, the story is slick, clever and keeps you thinking all the way through, never once in any other film have I seen such a glorious spectacle, this flm incorporates a crisp crime tale, exhilirating thrill sequences, unintended comedy and fantastic acting.     The 1995 film revolves around five criminals, who are set up on a police line-up and whilst they are being detained, form a criminal union and go on to rob a load of emeralds from a New York secret Taxi service (run by the police) after a short interlude with a contact of Mcmanus' they end up being associated with one Kaiser Sosa a renowned criminal legend who has the reputation of being a meciless killer.   They are then sent to destroy a coke deal by the alleged Mr Sosa, but are set up, after an explosive scene at the docks (where the deal was taking place), Roger 'Verbal' Kint is taken by the police and he gives a New York U.S. Customs officer a story, and he is let off with immunity but the twist at the end leaves you astounded, what happens is... Oh I am not going to tell you. You have to watch it yourself, it is owed a viewing or two, although I personally have seen it well over fifty times and I love it even more each time I see it. Bryan Singer captures the action well and Kevin Spacey is brilliant as a more than he seems cripple, and quite deservedly was awarded the Best Supporting Actor at the 1995 oscars, and I think this film established him as a top class actor.    All you geezers out there you have got to watch this film!
B0002EXH5O|1.0|yes.. another boring cd from megadebts demo years. peace sells and rust in peace were just typical late 80s glam rock. sorta like the cheesy untalented guns n roses. <br /> <br />for good megadeft listen to risk, part of world needs a hero, and the system has failed. <br /> <br />hangar 18 is the worst song they ever wrote!!! too poppish for me.
B0006399FS|5.0|its not as good, but its simply incredible.   All the tracks are simply strong, this is rock music everyone, this is rock music.  Best Band on the planet, can't wait to see them live.

B00065JTBA|5.0|For those of you who have apparently reviewed the box but don't know what the 100,000,000 is all about, its referencing the number of albums Bon Jovi has sold! and here to 100,000,000 more! I'm NOT a HUGE diehard fan, but I bougth Crossroads and a couple of the newer albums, but at such a price I couldnt resist (and hell there's no def leppard box out yet) and this box is really phenominal, I'm onyl through 2 discs and am blown back by these songs.  Thsi doesnt feel like other B sides cds I've gotten in the past, but literally 50 new Bon Jovi songs, so for any fan of Bon Jovi, put this on your xmas list or look for a cheap list pricing cause this is a sweet deal.  Pump up music, slow songs, great guitar work, and a booklet with the cutest eyes in rock n roll(sorry guys don't swing that way)
B00068IOWM|2.0|I let my emotions get the better of me and picked this up at a local Target store.  You should know that the CD contained within DOES include the 12th track \\"Fast Cars\\" not available on the regular US album.  That's the good part.  The bad part:  NO LYRICS to the songs, and the book is really not that interesting at all.  Some scribbled notes by the band members, no interesting photographs to speak off, very disappointing.  I will let other reviewers get into specifics about the songs, which I think are a notch below \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" after 2 listens.  Stick with the original album for less than ten bucks at Target.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein has always pushed the edge with everything they do. this cd is no different. Their music has always had a more symbolic meaning, with lyrics nothing short of true poetry. this cd goes deeper then ever before. With the song MEIN TEIL, they comment on Armin Meiwes, the convicted german canibal. In their song AMERIKA, the line \\"Coca-Cola, Wonderbra\\" is replaced in the last stanza with the line \\"Coca-Cola, sometimes war\\", adding a depth to the song and a whole new meaning to the lyrics. Rammstein not only pushes the edge of the envelope with graphic scenes such as the band walking away from a crashed plane with briefcases and a baseball bat (Reise Reise inside cover), but they create music with a greater depth then most modern music. In addition to the added imagery everywhere in REISE REISE, the cd is accompanied by never-better vocals, with much more experimentation with female singers; as well as stunning guitar, bass, drumbs, and keyboard. Their second longest cd ever (only beaten by herzeleid), REISE REISE is the best yet. A must have for any metal fan!
B00003CX9W|4.0|While I adore \\"Fantasia\\" as a profoundly glorious example of Animation As Art, I resent that the Walt Disney Company doesn't release its films in their original, unedited state.  HOWEVER, being one of the few people around who has actually seen the character that's been carefully edited out the the Pastorale Symphony sequence, I have to say that while it's fascinating to see the original (considering the historical context of racial humor in the late 1930's), the sudden appearance of the highly-caricatured, big-lipped, pig-tailed, subservient Black centaurette not only demonstrates a HUGE lapse of taste on the part of the Disney artists, but her 3 brief appearances are so awkward and embarrassing that in my opinion, the sequence actually flows better without her in it.  Trust me, the scenes are regretable.  I'd suggest, in all fairness, that Disney should provide the UNedited segments along with the extra archival material, with a disclaimer, so that viewers can at least see them and decide for themselves.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Fair and Balanced? Maybe not. But then who is? And Moore is MOST effective when he let's the other side speak for themselves. Nothing is more eye opening than watching deceptive people being their usual deceptive selves...over and over again. Some highlights: Congress critters scurrying for cover from the unfriendly cameras, businessmen talking about how to divvy up the loot from the occupied Iraq, El Shrubbo talking about \\"smoking him out\\" and then saying \\"I don't care where he is\\". And of course Britney Spears showing us that quite a few of the MTV watching airheads NEED to be drafted. Yep, it's a monumental tragi-comedy playing out here as we go from the Florida Fiasco of 2000 to the destruction and desolation of Ground Zero to the ongoing disaster of Afghanistan, which is a brief stop since we are on to bigger and better things in Iraq in no time. Along the way we learn that our country is bankrolled by Saudis, El Shrubbo snorted lines and went AWOL after dodging combat in Vietnam (a perfect role model for his freeper following), and most importantly, many people can be cowed by fear and nationalism into going along with anything someone with an Austrian or Texan accent tells them. Where it really does its damage is when it shows the victims suffering the consequences. As in dead and wounded and those they left behind. The war supporters are up a creek trying to justify those kind of sacrifices for the Big Lie. But this movie is also ultimately inspirational for it shows us that no matter what the next four years hold, we can rest assured knowing the Republic of Palau will be there sacrificing with us every step of the way.
B0006399FS|5.0|well what more can i say, but this is simply U2 at their very best, why people even rate this album as low as one is beyond a joke, if you want experimentation go and liaten to eminem or whatever its that simple, this is U2 doing what they do best, writing true honest heart wrenching songs, if anyone can say sometimes you cant make it on your own, or miracle drug, arent amongt U2'S finest songs, then i dunno what to say, <br /> <br />anyone who is put off by the bad reviews dont be, this is a superb album, you just need to hear the beauty
B000005L86|5.0|\\"We come with our culture...to enlighten the world\\". That about says it all for this massively inspirational \\"Jah Music\\" collection of superlative rhythms and lyrics. Lee Perry is more effective than ever in enhancing the feel of the music and adding his sound effects (what is that plaintive-mooing-cow sound anyway??) and the vocalists are certainly up to the task of bringing the Rasta creed of the lyrics to life in the most melodic manner imaginable. Every song is incredible...and the dub remix versions on disc number 2 all manage to expand on the originals. There are no weak spots, but the absolute highlights for me are the unearthly beautiful \\"Children Crying\\" (no matter how many times I hear it, I still feel chills) and the subtle, hypnotic spirituality of \\"Ark of the Covenant\\". This is an essential album for anyone who likes...music!
B0002XDODU|5.0|Greatest rammstein's album with no doubt. Itis one the best experimental industrial dark metal ever. GET IT ASAP. U won't be disappointed.
B00005U11Z|5.0|See the lineup of Journey since 1998.  This DVD which was shot in November of 2000 was released in 2001.  This is a great concert which shows what the Journey experience is all about.  If you are a Journey fan you will absolutely love this video.  If you are not sure you should see this to make of your own mind.  And if you think Journey is not the band for you then this is not your DVD.  But you should see it anyway.  Most people miss the Journey experience because they only hear a few songs and none of them live.  This is all live, no music videos.  If you find you love this as much as I do then come on over to Journey's web site and find out what you have been really missing.  This is truly an excellently produced video meant for someone who needs to see a Journey concert more than once.  Keep listening to it and watching it and you will hear and see more of the Journey experience each time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a fan of Joss Whedon's work (Buffy, Angel, Toy Story, ...) and yet I didn't watch this show when it was on the air. I'm very sorry about that because I just finished watching the series on DVD and it's full of engrossing stories and real characters. The crew is made of real people, nobody is a larger-than-life hero. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. <br />   One problem I had with the series was that there is Mandarin sprinkled in the dialogue, but the subtitles don't translate it.  I understand Mandarin, but the actors don't have a good Chinese accent and most of the time I couldn't understand what they were saying (the longer phrases). For those, I had to refer to the different web sites that show the translation.  <br />   The series leaves you with lots of questions because it was cancelled prematurely. But it was still worth watching and I will watch it all over again. Good news is that there will be a movie that hopefully will tie all the lose ends.
0767818040|3.0|\\"BODY DOUBLE\\" is another in a long line of crass and brutal Hitchcockian thrillers by director De Palma. The story centers around a claustrophobic, out-of-work actor named Jake Scully (played engagingly by the underrated Craig Wasson) who discovers his long time girl has been cheating on him, and thus slums around with several of his acting buddies while trying to get his life straightened out. When one of his friends offers him a job babysitting some plants at a lavish modern home while the owner is gone overseas, Jake jumps at the chance. But along with the mundane task of watering the foliage and keeping the house clean, Jake is introduced (via telescope) to a naughty neighbor who performs a routine striptease that is too tempting for him to resist peeping in on. As night after night goes by, Jake becomes convinced that the lady's life is in danger, and (through a series of brilliant montages) begins to follow her on the road, through a shopping mall, and on a crowded beach which ends in a wonderful chase squence. To reveal anymore of the plot would be detrimental to the viewer, but as Jake investigates deeper and deeper into his neighbor's life he encounters a young, quirky porno star (Melanie Griffith) who proves to have a lot of valuable information that sheds some light on the woman's kinky behavior. Director Brian De Palma does an excellent job concocting a superb and intriguing mystery while enlivening it with swirling camera moves and neat little touches here and there, but if you're expecting an old-fashioned suspense picture forget it: \\"BODY DOUBLE\\" is gruesomely violent, filled with harsh language, and saturated with nudity and sex (needlessly so for such a short and straightforward murder mystery). So be forwarned if you see it. But despite its exploitative nature, the film can be hailed as a successful exercise with a top-notch cast and a solid narrative. ULTIMATE GROSS OUT MOMENT: watch out for that power drill! RATED R/114 minutes.OLENCE: about 7 scenes, NUDITY/SEXUAL SUGGESTIVENESS: about 12 hard-core scenes (RATED R/114 minutes).
B0006399FS|3.0|First of all, before you buy the album, if you're expecting ten more Vertigo's, or anything similar to an Elevation, don't waste your time.  U2 does not ROCK on this CD, with the exception of the opening song, which does NOT reflect what is on the following tracks.  I have a feeling that this album will grow on me, as most U2 albums have, but if you're expecting the edgy U2 you heard on Achtung Baby, or the great substance of their incredible 80's songs like Pride, New Years Day, Bad, the entire Joshua Tree album, etc., this album will be different than you thought. <br /> <br />However, for those of you U2 fans that loved All That You Can't Leave Behind, think of this as a double album.  After listening to it a few times, it seems like U2 didn't skip a beat and picked up right where they left off with their previous album.  That is the best analogy I can give.
B00065VTU4|5.0|After all these years, I still believe that \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" is Clapton's best solo album. I will readily admit I'm not such a big fan of the more recent blues albums such as \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\", which I thought was rather dull, as well intentioned as it was. But I digress.<br /><br />\\"461 Ocean Boulevard - Deluxe Edition\\" has grown from the original 40 min. album to an exquisite 2CD spread (26 tracks, 142 min.), and quite comfortably at that. CD1 (15 tracks, 69 min.) brings of course the original 10 tracks, and they still sparkle today as they did 30 years ago. The remastered sound is fantastic. It has of course the hits \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\", \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\", and \\"Motherless Children\\" (all from the original Side 1), but there really are no weak songs here. Other classics include \\"Let It Grow\\", the pensive \\"I Can't Hold Out\\", and the album closer \\"Mainline Florida\\". The 5 bonus tracks are session out-takes from the album recordings, they have appeared elsewhere before on various compilations such as \\"Crossroads\\", but are grouped together here for the first time. My fave of them is \\"Meet Me (At the Bottom)\\", a mostly instrumental jam session. CD2 (11 tracks, 73 min.) is a live album, recorded in London at the end of the 461 Ocean Blvd tour in December, 1974. After the announcer's \\"Well Ladies and Gentlemen, this is it, the last show of the tour, please welcome Mr. Eric Clapton and his band!\\", we're in for a treat. Only 3 of the 11 tracks have appeared before on the Crossroads compilations. The highlights are many, including \\"Let It Grow\\", the Steve Winwood cover \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\", a rousing \\"Tell the Truth\\", the Jimi Hendrickx cover \\"Little Wing\\", and the closer \\"Let It Rain\\", with at the end EC simply saying \\"bye bye, thank you\\" to an elated audience.<br /><br />The liner notes are a bit skimpy, but that aside, everything is an A+ on this \\"Deluxe Edition\\". Let me emphasize that this is not just for the EC fanatic. Anyone interested in just plain good music will be taken aback by this album, finding Clapton at the top of his game. Strongly recommended!t plain good music will be taken aback by this album, finding Clapton at the top of his game. Strongly recommended!
B0000035E7|3.0|Bleach is a decent debut album by any standards, but the fact is, none of us (except for a devoted few) would be talking about this had Nevermind not launched Nirvana into superstardom.  Production value aside, many of the tracks show a band that hasn't quite found an identity, but a few songs stand out and give a sign as to what would come.  And let's be honest, my little brother in the high school marching band could lay down a better beat than Chad Channing.  Dave Grohl provided a much-needed presence behind the drum kit, and that played no small part in their success following Bleach.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Trojan Prince Paris visits Spartan ruler Menelaus and returns to Troy with the Spartan's wife, Helen.  Thus begins one of history's most famous tales, as the Spartans and Greeks load up the boats and sail across the Aegean Sea toward Troy, to retrieve the woman who literally launched a thousand ships.   <br /> <br />\\"Troy\\" focuses on one man, Achilles, on one of those ships.   Played by Brad Pitt, Achilles leads the men from the field, even though he is torn about whether thousands of men should die in order to return one woman to a man she left.   Filmed on the picturesque blazing beaches of Malta, \\"Troy\\" is full of action, love and a few too many shots of half-naked Pitt.   <br /> <br />Not as aesthetically ambitious as other historical epics like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, Troy is more concerned with telling a good story in the populist sense. It is not a film for teachers of English or History to use as an example of what is known about the Trojan War; those familiar with Homer's source material may be somewhat disappointed with the liberties taken (even though Homer took some himself). The film is essentially an inaccurate re-telling of a story we know is already full of inaccuracies.  <br /> <br />But holding up this film to the original work of Homer misses the point entirely. The filmmakers knew an accurate depiction would be impossible to make and even more impossible to sell. They borrow the spirit from The Iliad and transform it into a modern action film. In doing so, director Wolfgang Peterson creates a film that will thrill and captivate the same viewers that would never see the version Homer intended. <br />

B0006399FS|1.0|I used to love this group, but they are so OVER. <br /> <br />Aside from 'Vertigo', which in and of itself gets painful to listen to after a few times, there is no reason to buy this album.

That they're so fab and rich they can just churn out any crap, slap some 'cool' sounding titles on songs and people will just eat it up? Apparently.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|I've lost count on how many Jacko/Jacksons 5 compilations have been issued in the past couple of years. So, what is the need of including some of the hits AGAIN in their original form in this compilation? This collection would have been a 5 star compilation if only all the tracks here were rare and/or live performances of well known hits. That aside, there is a lot of good stuff here for the fan. The DVD alone could habe been sold separately for 20 bucks, so all in all consider, you get a good deal for your money.

B0006399FS|5.0|By now U2 has proven again and again that they are the biggest, most creative band since the Beatles. They dont need to invent a new sound on each album, and they have long proven that they can maintain a concience without preaching. They are in their 'Let it Be' phase, along with their previous album, they are getting back to their original sound. This one has all the feeling of a great classic Rock album, think 'Who's Next', 'Led Zep II', 'Beggars Banquet'. Even the people trashing this album agree that this is a 'singles' album, because its full with so many great songs, any of these could be their next single. All I can say is; start loading those grammys, because this one is a winner.
B0006399FS|1.0|The new album finally has been revealed. For misfortune of all us, the 4 years waiting have been in vain.     This new album shows a numb, mainstream, unispired and bored U2, ideal for dumb teens who want more and more CD's of any band. Here doesnt exist musical quality. All opposite, this album is an exaltation of Bonos Rock Star , who almost can't sing, and still thinks he is 25 years old and he can do whatever he wants with his rough voice. The lack of musical risk is seen in all scope, bands  clothes , Bono`s hair and sunglasses , the recycled canned music from ATYCLB, the silly and unnecessary production, the excessive marketing campaign, etc. Despite all hype, the only thing U2 have obtained is the opposite effect, that is, more and more fans whom are waking up and stopping to adore unconditionally this sell out band wrongly called \\"U2\\".    Happiness is a warm gun U2...

They can go from full-throttle rockers (Do The Evolution, Lukin) to soft ballads (Black, Low Light) to funk (Dirty Frank) to accoustic (Thumbing my Way).  Simply put, they can do it all.  Not too mention the best live show going. <br /> <br />This Greatest Hits package demonstrates their wide range.  A must have for the younger generations that haven't yet experienced Pearl Jam, and a fun collectible for those like me who already have everything.  My only gripe is that I would have exchanged \\"Light Years,\\" which in my opinion is only mediocre, for \\"Footsteps.\\"  Some will complain that this collection is too radio-hit friendly, but #1) what do you expect from a greatest hits collection (if you want rarities go buy \\"Rare Dogs.\\")  #2)You can't really call much of the PJ catalogue hit-friendly since only songs from \\"Ten\\" obtained the status of big hits on radio and MTV.  In hindsight, when I see what becomes a hit on TRL today, I'm glad PJ bowed-out of the video making prematurely. <br /> <br />Anyways, if you're a PJ newbie buy this album...then buy all the other albums including the live bootlegs...then see them live, you won't be disappointed.  Oh yeah, if you're one of \\"those people\\" who says that PJ sucked after \\"Ten\\" then you really need to have your head examined.
B0006399FS|4.0|I read recently that the Edge basically begins all the creation of u2's music with his guitar work and then Larry and Adam come in and do their part, and then Bono comes in and does the vocals and lyrics to the music. So that's probably why there were rumors this would be a harder sounding u2 album, but I'm guessing Bono came in and changed all that with his quest for his band to stay the most popular in the world. There are many catchy choruses, sing a long verses, and universal ballads like SYCMIOYO which will be huge hits with fans and once again keep u2 in the mainstream while keeping their credibility. Luckily, there are a great band and they pull it off greatly, as this is one very solid record, my people.  <br /> <br />Luckily, u2 are a strong democracy, and every member has their say. I still think u2 are at their best when experimenting, and there is some experimentation with this album. L&P or Else has some unique industrial sounds we've never heard from the Irish boys, and AMAAW is basically the band doing a R&B version of a Stones song. People can say this is just a pop song, but 1)that's totally wrong and you have to appreciate u2 taking a step in another direction and 2)bass lines don't sound this good on pop songs. Still, two of some of the best songs I've heard this year from the band didn't make the cut, \\"Fast Cars\\" and \\"Mercy\\". The former is absolutely stunning, it is so out there for u2 and sounds like a young energetic band right out Turkey with it's arabic sounds. The latter was so exciting to hear because it sounds like it was ripped right off of Achtung Baby, it seriously could have been a single. And it didn't make the cut??  <br /> <br />But despite my gripes with the album's sometimes habit of being too constructed or forced, in the end its a fine piece of work. MD is a great song with a killler solo by Edge, same with ABOY. The whole first side of the album is classic u2, the second half is still growing on me but there are good tunes in there.  <br /> <br />It's time for u2 to start making bad records, they're all in their mid-40s and history says they will. But they keep their habit of trying to be the best band in the world, and succeeding. But while their at, here's to another experimental phase. Go make another Zooropa on tour FELLAS!
B00028HBKM|3.0|I am a Christian and a Catholic but my faith is not solely based on passion and sufferings. Sure. I know very well that Christ died for me in such unmeasurable pain. But do I really need to see it in a gory kind of way? What's unrealistic is the way the punishment was portrayed- too harsh for a human to endure, I mean physically. We must remember that Christ was 100 % human during that time and subject to physical limitations of a human being. The sufferings were simply portrayed as too unbelievable. Any human subject to that kind of punishment will die sooner from loss of blood, broken bones, and other internal organ damages. Didn't you see how Mary the mother's towel get soaked in so much blood? it looked like you can squeeze it and get a gallon of blood. Simply put, the movie is overly exaggerated. Some members of the Catholic Church said that it was the closest thing to the truth. What truth? What's the basis? If it cannot be 100% true, then it is still a lie- a Hollywood flick.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|An amazing compilation of Peter Gabriel's best recordings ever! I was shaking with anticipation for this CD and I was not let down. 2 CD set, one called \\"Hit\\" one called \\"Miss\\" portraying what I feel is PG's classification of songs he feels were righfully successful and songs he felt should've been, but were never given a chance. Peter Gabriel was one who always walked the fine line between commercial and indie music and his fans were always the beneficiaries. I have worn out these CD's and made copies for both my cars. I absolutely LOVE it!
B0006399FS|5.0|I bought the album today and I love it, I've been a u2 fan for almost 10 years now (not a big fan of their 80s albums).  The thing is why do u2, mostly Bono, feel its neccessary to advertise to the whole universe that the album is being released? If I see that I_tunes commerical one more time, I'll throw something at the tV.  Why don't they just let the music speak for itself? I mean, their so big all this pub doesnt matter IMO, people love u2 some hate them.  By now, I dont think opinions will swing much when it comes to them.  I'm a fan and I love \\"how to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" but I was going to lower my perfect rating to 3 or 4 stars because of these issues I have with the band.  A U2 I-Pod?? I know that wasn't Larry or Adam's idea.
B00008RH1H|5.0|First off I would like to say that the cheap version of this film is not all that bad (despite what people are saying). I bought it on ebay for .01 and it lived up to the price I paid and then some. There were some imperfections in sound quality and the translation was not exactly scholarly (lots of profanity, in fact - which I do not think Kurosawa intended) - but given the choice between this and the $40 criterion version - my choice was simple!<br /><br />The film itself is a brilliant piece of work and deserves the praise it gets - as one of Kurosawa's greatest works - many people have mentioned the striking scenes of the horses galloping through an almost mystical fog - very startling effect indeed. Kurosawa is a master of space - and his camera movements always look perfect and spontaneous at the same time!
0596007124|5.0|First of all, I would like to thank the authors for writting this excellent book. Hats off to all of you, O'Reilly and Head First Team (for editing)!    I literally love this book. In fact, I kissed this book in front of my wife. :)    I like everything about this book from brain-friendly writting style coupled with sound OO principles to heart-touching examples. The impressing examples in this book are green in my heart.     I have read many books and articles on patterns and found them dry. Bascially, It was boring to learn patterns from windows/UI specific (including maze) examples.     I would like to make a point here about GoF Design Pattern book. It's a good reference book, but GoF MUST come up with second edition.     I humbly respect the great work of the authors and I request them to write more specialized books like this.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I went in to see the movie with lower expectations than with the first two, mostly in part due to the change of directors.  I feel Cuarn did a good job as far as creating a darker atmosphere overall with the movie.  He did, however, leave out many crucial parts to the story line, which would leave non-readers of the series confused.  I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this film, it was still done great, but just doesn't live up to the greatness of the book or the standards set by Columbus with the first 2 films.
B0002I831S|5.0|I love this show, and it's fantastic that the full seasons are finally on DVD.<br /><br />I love the content of this set, but not the packaging.  Many others have expressed the same concerns, but I feel like the booklet attached to the disk case will eventually tear, even with careful use.<br /><br />The video quality is unchanged from the previous DVD releases (at least as best I can tell - I only owned a few of the 1st season 2fers...I assume the rest are the same quality).<br /><br />The sound quality is greatly improved over the 2fers, with Dolby 5.1 giving the subwoofer a jolt here and there as required.<br /><br />My only quarrel with the contents?  I would have liked audio commentaries from some of the principals, or at least text commentary for all the episodes, instead of just a handful.  I thoroughly enjoy the commentaries.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the first season and very excited about getting season 2.  Season 3?  Yeah...I'll pick it up used!
B000002KHH|5.0|I agree with all the reviews that this is THE seminal heavy-metal album.  That means it's perfect for any male between the ages of 12 and 16.  After that, what relevance does it have except for music historians or the nostalgic? Once in a parking lot I saw a middle-aged guy in a Lexus SUV blasting \\"Iron Man\\" with the windows rolled down and a scowl on his face--truly comic!
B0002DB52M|5.0|I guess all the people giving bad reviews to this movie didn't reliaze that it is actually a play, set on one stage. <br /> <br />It is very hard to capture a play on film, but this was done quite effectively here. <br /> <br />It's also a good story, based on the depression era. Nicole Kidman acts the part of a fugitive arriving in a small town, where the people there ask favors from her to hide her out. They gradually increase their hold over her, until a dramatic and suprise ending comes.  <br /> <br />At three hours its a bit long, but I found it very enjoyable and quite good. it does have some strong sexual content and isn't really for kids, and obviously not for all the people who like the regular \\"Hollywood Trash\\" type of movie. <br /> <br />I will probably rent it again in a few months, I thought it was very well done. <br /> <br />P.S. I'm not usaully a fan of plays  either.
B0006399FS|2.0|So I'd be lying if I didn't at least give U2 credit for trying to rock on this CD.  Unlike that last thing where all they did was mope about the current state of the world, this CD does try to pick it up a notch and make music that is actually powerful in the way the Joshua Tree was.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I feel like this CD is tired.  Bono is not a politician, he's a musician, and I think it's time he realized this.  There's a lot of the same old cliches about the current state of politics and the world and I'm not trying to be rude but we've all heard them before.  I think that musicians need to stop acting like they have some amazingly profound idea about governments when really all they did was read someone else's idea in a newspaper and then act like it was their own.  Bono is the king of this concept which he demonstrates to the fullest extent on this album.  So while it does \\"rock\\" at times, the rocking is overshadowed by some drivel about love and some more about governments.   <br /> <br />But if you're a U2 fan you will enjoy this album because no matter how much those things don't appeal to me, I give them credit for being really good at what they do.  And while Bono may have no place in world politics, at least he's been able to shed a little light on a few events for the bozos that don't actually get their news from newsworthy sources.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight and I was shocked. I was told by numerous people that, all politics aside, it was a good movie.  Even if this movie were billed as a fictional account (it is billed as a documentary) of Michael Moore's vision of President Bush, it was a poorly made film.  It is a film that tries to argue a point of view but yet doesn't quite know how.  It makes random points without establishing any connection from one point to another.  Not only was this poor film making, the filmmaker flat out lied to it's viewers.  Is America this gullible?  I have a hard time believing that Americans could buy into this garbage.  Not only are the filmmaker's arguments random and pointless but they are made up, misconstrued, and false.  I strongly urge anyone who has seen this film to watch another film title FarenHYPE9/11.  Michael Moore is a liar.  From the beginning of the film to the end, he lies.  I have never voted for a republican president in my life, but after viewing this propaganda garbage, this November may be my first vote for a republican.  SEE FarenHYPE9/11.  Note: It may be hard to find in video stores because there are very few copies and those that exist, are usually rented.
6305428220|5.0|First of all, Robert Rodriguez has an innate gift of turning everything he touches into solid gold.  The guy is incapable of making a lame film.  Even El Mariachi was charming!  And Spy Kids 3D?  If you can name another director today who could have made a 3D movie that fun I dare you.  So, needless to say, when he teams up with modern day horror's #1 writer on a movie about aliens and high school kids the movie is going to be sweet! <br /> <br />The entire cast here is tremendous.  Long before he was a lamo heart-throb, Josh Hartnett shined as Zeke, the stoner drug-peddlar who didn't like high school but wasn't as much of a druggie as he seemed.  Elijah Wood plays a hero of epicly smaller proportion than the one that made him most famous (Frodo) but he still shines.  And in Trivial Pursuit 20 years from now, the game winning question should definitely ask, \\"What movie teamed upcoming R&B megastar Usher with the hottest latina actress of her generation, Salma Hayek?\\"  I'll tell you, the Faculty did baby!  This movie is so good it'll give you permanent chills. <br /> <br />Plus, it ends with the music of Oasis which is so damn sweeet it's inexplicable!
078401213X|3.0|we just finished watching this movie in my Discrete Mathematics class today.  very thought provoking and great for a low budget film.  I give it 3.141592654.......... out of 5 stars. :)
B00068IOWM|4.0|I love the new U2 album. The DVD is fantastic. But the book bites. It's like the band played with finger paint for a couple hours, then published the mess. Very little material in it other than the sketches and weird paintings. No background historical information like with the Police box set. Save your money and buy the Limited Edition version \\"How to Dismantle and Atomic Bomb\\" with the DVD and the CD. That version is even cheaper at Target ($15 in the store). To pay $30 and get this lousy book puts a bad taste in my mouth about the whole purchase.
B0006399FS|4.0|An excellent follow up to \\"All that You Can't Leave Behind\\", I feel it is a bit more raw, other reviews have said a bit more polished, either way it sounds great. The standout track being \\"Sometime You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", a song that just won't leave my head. The chiming Edge guitars are back in full force, Bono sounds great at 44, the rasp and age in his voice fitting the music well, excellent ponding Mullen drums, and Clayton's thudding bass. All the ingrdients are there.
B00063MBU8|5.0|ok im a huge simple plan fan,but the 1rst time i listened 2 this cd ill admit i wasnt that into it.at first it sounded the same as there last cd(which i like if im in a really hyper good mood).well then i listened 2 this cd more and i realized it isnt just like there other one.it has  a lot more songs that have 2 do with real problems going on in the world.its not as \\"poppy\\" sounding as there last one.my fav song is \\"perfect world\\" thats a great song.well i guess what im tyring 2 say is if at first u dont like that cd the 1rst time u hear it give it a second chance and i guarantee there will be some songs u like or even luv!!thank u 4 reading my review!<br /><br />p.s check out good charlottes cds 2 they rox!!bye
B00007KQA3|1.0|I've just read the reviews detailing how the woefully misguided director ruined an awesome adaptation of Orwell's classic novel by removing the Eurythmics soundtrack as well as making totally inappropriate stylistic changes to the look of the film.  (A brightly lit 1984?  How many ways can one say \\"bad idea\\"??)  I refuse to buy this DVD and insist that the production company release a DVD that remains true to the VHS version. <br />
B00003CXPJ|4.0|This movie is a classic.  For those who say it is dumb, well maybe the joke is on you. Thats the entire premise of the film -to poke fun at people who think they are smart and live off of the obvious. <br />Quite frankly I can watch this movie on loop and never get board.  While Zoolander is great, its Owen Wilson as \\"Hansel\\" that makes this movie spin.  \\"Don't you know I'm loco?\\" Is quite possibly the funniest moment in the movie.   <br />So quit taking yourselves so seriously.  This movie makes you laugh if and only if you are open to it.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Important note:Amazon.com is not listing the 12th song on this album the great \\"Fast Cars\\" <br /> <br />U2 has become a band that is definetly comfortable in it's own skin...but that doesn't mean that they are not still capable of writing beautiful tunes...the standouts for me are the gorgeous <br />\\"Crumbs From Your Table\\",\\"Original of The Species\\"..the powerful \\"All Because of You\\" and perhaps the best tune on the album the experimental Morroccan-tinged \\"Fast Cars\\"  ..the only mistep on this album is the song \\"Yahweh\\"....which is a bit overbearing and sounds a little too much like \\"Miracle Drug\\"....but this album is definetly an improvement over the last album \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"
1400032717|5.0|I read a chapter or two, then minutes later, picked it up again. My heart goes out to the Christophers of this world. Some people will always be misunderstood. Great story, I bought one for my sister for Christmas.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I have to say this is one of the better live shows ive seen. I have never actually seen these guys live. But this dvd is just like your there for the one's that didnt live the show live in person, now you can. I must say I loved the preformance of Thoughtless. One of KoRn's better songs and Amy nails it. Run Out and get this masterpiece first chance you get and you as was I will simply be amazed.
B0006399FS|5.0|Vertigo is not indicative of the sound of this album, just as The Fly wasn't indicative of the sound of Achtung Baby.  I remember going to buy Achtung Baby the day it was released, and driving home with it playing in my car on a cold rainy day...and when Zoo Station kicked in, I knew I was listening to something special.  This is great album, not the rock album that Bono promised, but vintage U2.  When Bono sings, \\"God I need your help tonight,\\" and Edge's soaring guitar explodes in Miracle Drug, I knew once I again I was listening to something special.  Any remaining doubt will be gone, when you hear the aching opening melody of City of Blinding Lights...oh you look so beautiful...in the city, of blinding lights...
0140277447|5.0|Here's my 2 cents on this...  <br />Perhaps what the saddest part of the whole Nanking \\"incident\\" is that Japan is absolutely unwilling to fess up to its wartime atrocities and instead paint itself as wartime victim (Hiroshima, Nagasaki)...While it's true that the Atomic bombs were inhumane to say the least, the purpose was to halt the war and prevent even more casualties on the Allies' side ...The Nanking massacre lacked any noble cause, motive or reasoning any decent human being could accept. However, the fact that this awful event happened is not the most evil part (All countries have done things in their past which they are ashamed of)...the most evil part is the fact that the Japanese would much rather sweep its rather unflattering past and forget it ever happened.... Which of course the victims of these atrocities (and their families) are unwilling to do...If not for the understandable reason that they at least want a \\"sorry\\" or acknowledgement that these acts actually took place, but for the very fact that these countries are anxious that that Japan's warmongering head might rear its ugly head again...\\"Those that don't learn from history are destined to repeat it\\"... Meanwhile the Japanese people seem to sit there surprised (and have the attitude \\"oh here we go again\\") when China, Korea and several other countries bring this matter up...Japan does everything to shake the responsibility of these things so as not to upset the right wingers and to avoid any significant (monetary) compensation ...from using technicalities such of \\"statutes of Limitations\\"\\" to \\"missing application deadlines\\" ...Is this supposed to foster good relations? Does Japan really believe that they'll win a permanent veto-wielding seat on the UN Security Council with these shenanigans? Ha!  One thing Japan has to realize that it must seriously address this issues before it is ever going to be genuinely trusted in the international community...People are not just going to forget... <br />Japan's neighbors are getting more economically and militarily powerful, and as these countries' sway becomes more significant and Japan's less, Japan is going to realize that Asia can be a lonely neighborhood for an unrepentant former neighborhood bully.  <br />No wonder Koizumi has his lips so firmly planted on Bush's derriere...Without The United States Koizumi would have no one to talk to at those APEC meetings! <br />
0920668372|4.0|It's a great book showing the unconditional, unending love of a parent for a child.  I can't get through it without crying.  The people who see a \\"dark\\" or \\"incestuous\\" meaning in it are sick.  The author originally wrote this to express his feelings after losing his own child, there are no hidden meanings in it.  The mother climbing through her son's window to rock him may seem extreme, but it's a children's story, all parts aren't meant to be taken literally!  I LOVE this book and plan on reading it to my child (hopefully without crying!).
B0006399FS|4.0|As a long-time U2 fan but not an apologist (I REALLY hated that \\"Gangs of NY\\" song--awful), I'm still amazed by the knee-jerk non-musical slamming of them in some \\"reviews\\" here. <br /> <br />Here's the lowdown: if you never were a U2 fan, this album isn't going to make you one.  It sounds most definitely like a U2 album, which some people are very critical of.  That's the good news and the bad news. <br /> <br />It's not a singles-fest like Joshua Tree or a complete reinvention like Achtung Baby--nor is it an experiment along the lines of Pop (totally underrated album, BTW), but more like a grandiose helping of everything that U2 has always been strong at creating. <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" completely kicks; \\"Sometimes You Can't...\\" is an instant classic--that one will be played by U2 live for years.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" sounds like a cross between U2, Simple Minds and Peter Gabriel.  The coolest surprise is \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" featuring a killer bass line hook and Edge's Spanish-style strumming. <br /> <br />There's a couple of clunkers here, and to be sure there's a few songs that sound like add-water-and-stir U2.  But it's certainly a solid CD, and I'd take U2's decent-to-good-to-really good over most current bands' \\"best\\" any day.  Trust me, after 10+ listens, it really starts to grow on you... and that's a good sign.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This ultimate box set rocks, rocks, & rocks and since it so hot it will definitely transform non-believers to believe. Another thing you are treated for the very first time to witness his live concert released on dvd. I was mesmerized by his amazing performance that is why I hope epic records should release more live concert of Michael Jackson. So, usher and justin timberlake better luck next time as Michael Jackson is still the undisputed heavy weight \\"King Of Pop\\" champion of the world. No offense guys but 100 millions or more would agree that still on this millenium age he is worthy as his star still brightly shines filled with magic and written in \\"Music History\\".

B0002F6BRE|4.0|My five year old and I really liked this movie.  It's cute and funny-nothing I have to worry about my son seeing.  However, I am obsessed with finding the elevator code for the secret elevator on the DVD extras under fun and games.  What am I missing?  Does anyone know where to find it?
B0006399FS|1.0|Well... what I can say after reading all these commentaries. My personal opinion, indeed. I do not want to speak of the wonderful career of U2, only about the new album. 11 nice done songs with a big commercial interest are here. The A side of the disc is far better that the B side , which is singsong and boring. There are interesting songs like City Of Blinding Lights, but there are horrible ones like One Step Closer, Yahweh (Bono in his lowest level as a singer), Original Of Species and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. The Edge uses the same guitars all the time, Larry almost is unnecessary in this album, as well Adam. It is a simple, short disc, designed to sell. <br />I don't feel the album, that's all. After 49 minutes I'm the same person, worried about the same things and trying to listen to better albums. This album won't change me at all, unlike previous U2 albums like Pop, Acthung Baby or Joshua Tree.
B00068IOWC|5.0|and better than ever. This CD is amazing and should be on everyone's christmas list. The songs touch you in a place no other modern artist dares to tread. The Disc is filled with single after potential single. The Edge rocks this CD into another stratosphere with his guitar work. The production is up to the task as well, as there are only a few cases where a song could possibly be improved. U2 takes the sound they were developing on ATYCLB and provide it with a sharper edge that makes this CD even better. A must have for any music fan.
B0002Z1EG2|2.0|This album has some good songs but many songs on here are very forgetable. <br />Like if you're gonna put bonus song's on the album don't put the same song more then once on the album what's the point of putting 2 versions of the same song? <br /> <br />Im talking about \\"Party For Two\\" that is the worst song I've heard from Shania in a while has she lost her touch? <br /> <br />This Greatest Hits collection is not the best but I suggest you try out - <br />Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (Limited Edition with Bonus CD) [LIMITED EDITION] by Britney Spears Now that Greatest Hits collection has hits and great songs!
B0006399FS|5.0|This is not only the best album of this year, but it may end up being a modern classic. This CD rocks from the start and continues till the end. As an overly critical U2 fan, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this CD the first time I listened to it. After waiting for so long in between CD's, you usually feel let down the first go round because you expect groundbreaking stuff. Well U2 may not be creating a new sound on this record, but what they have done is reinvent themselves, and the result is spectacular. 9 out of the 11 songs could easily be singles, that's how much quality and quantity there is on this record. Edge's guitar work on the CD is amazing, and the production quality is high quality as well. It really seems as if they took their time finishing this one, and when you listen to the CD, you can appreciate why. If you're a fan of good music, hurry out and get this CD, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B000004286|5.0|This music sends chills down my Celtic spine.  Absolutely sublime, incredibly beautiful.  \\"For the Love of a Princess\\" is my favorite.  James Horner is a genius.  Thank you, Mel, for making this beautiful, yet disturbing movie. You have achieved perfection.
B00068IOWM|5.0|For anyone that caught SNL last saturday, U2 is and will always be the best live act in the world. On their next tour they will have ample material to choose from as the new CD contains hit after hit. Not since Achtung Baby has there been a more complete album. The Edge's guitar powers each track and the hooks are great. You'll be singing each song at the top of your lungs in no time.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf was a pretty cute film. One of Will Ferrell's better perfomances if you ask me. The story: A little baby sneaks into Santa's toy bag on Christmas Eve. When Santa and all the elves discovery him back at the North Pole, they decide that he will stay and become an elf just like all of them. But, since he is a human, Buddy grows much faster and much bigger than all the other elves. He soon discovers that he doesn't fit in with everybody else so he decides to travel to New York where his dad lives, but his dad is on the naughty list. Find out how Buddy brings the Christmas spirit to his dad and every else in New York City.<br /><br />Again, a cute movie and a great film for the holidays since Christmas isn't that faraway.<br /><br />B
B0006399FS|5.0|If you're not a U2 fan; don't waste other people's time slamming the band (i.e. Time for the truth, How to Dismantle a great band, Happiness is a worm gun; comfortably numb).  Take your energies elsewhere. Cheers.
B00005JMUL|5.0|Director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks create a magical holiday gem that is true to the spirit of the beloved children's book. The Polar Express whisks a group of children, led by a doubting boy, to the North Pole to see Santa. Very young children may be bothered by a few scenes.
B00005JMXX|3.0|I was kind of dissapointed with this movie.  I thoght it was a little better than many reviewers say, but not much.  It just doesn't have much of a story to it.  The story is simple: a kid is trapped in New york, and his father tries to get to him.  The problem: the story hardly seems to take place in the movie.  You basically see the great CGI effects for about 5-10 minutes, then they go back to the story for about 2.  So, this film was OK, but I have no intention of buying it.
B0006399FS|4.0|Yeah, the music isn't that groundbreaking, but there are some great melodies and lyrics and the vibe is up again. I loved the 90s cyncism and glam, and now I'm happy to hear it break and some heart come spilling out. Their is love showing in this album and that takes some guts. In addition, I bet this is going to be a pretty sweet live show.<br /><br />Get it and listen.  :)
B0001AP12G|3.0|No doubt Kanye West has been and is one of hottest and sought after producers in the industry...yet every producer was not meant to stand front and center.  Is this a trend? <br /> <br />After hearing all of the hype about Kanye, I was eager to hear what he had to offer of his own; I was sadly disappointed.  \\"All Falls Down\\" and \\"Through the Wire\\" are maybe 2 out of 3 great songs on the entire CD.  And I can certainly do without some of the intermissions. (A few of them are pretty funny though. I'll give him that.) I will definitely be placing this back on the auction block.  <br /> <br />I don't mean to pee on anybody's dream and I know most will disagree with this review, however diversity makes the world go 'round!  I gotta keep it real. At least for me.
B00006G8G1|2.0|I went to the store, bought ROCK IN RIO, and went hoem in a hurry, thinking with myself that this could not go wrong: Maiden in Rock in RIo in front of 250,000 people, playing at their best even after 23 years on the road. <br /> <br />So, I put the disc on my DVD and what did I find? That Steve Harris edited it. Listen, dude, I can deal with changing angles each three seconds, or even two... But I can not deal with changing cameras four times within a second!! So, by the middle of the show I was not caring anymore, it was so annoying that, in dissilusion, I turned off the DVD and watched the other half the next day. <br /> <br />Why did Steve Harris dit it? I don't know. He proved he's the total boss (deservedly, of course), because I can not see how anyone involved (the band members, the managers, the record company, whoever!) did not tell him that his edtiing was awful, not professional, headache inducing... Man, I can not come with enough words to describe how such a bad experience is to watch this DVD, due only to the terrible editing.
B0006399FS|1.0|VERY disapointing. Vertigo is the only 'rocking' song, its no wonder that is the only song being promoted. If you judge the album by that one song you will be very disapointed, the rest of the album is a bland elevator ride of music, very sappy unispiring lyrics.
0553573403|1.0|My repeated attempts to read this book have been unsuccessful...I give up. There seems to be no continuity and I don't like a to have dozens of characters with different storylines. It's my personal choice and everytime a chapter ended without going anywhere, I just said to myself\\"great, wonder how many hundreds of pages do I have to read to pick up where this chapter just left?\\"<br /><br />If you don't mind having dozens of plots and if you also don't mind breaking the story every chapter only to pick it up some hundred pages later,  it may be for you. I like a manageable number of plots and certainly not 3 dozens of main characters. The book didn't generate enough interest to keep reading because a particular story  stops  every time it gets interesting, after a while you are too tired to remember each one and you don't care.
B0002858YS|1.0|I used to think that ICP was the worst, but I have since been enlightened with the constant playing of music by \\"The Killers\\" on local radio stations. I cannot fathom how anyone can say with a straight face that they like, much less love, this group. The lead singer's voice is absolutely grating and orders of magnitude beyond annoying. It boils my blood everytime he whines into the mic and belts out senseless, meaningless lyrics. I simply cannot stand the guy's obnoxious voice, and the music leaves quite a bit to be desired too.<br /><br />While I consider myself an open listner who can go between rap, hip-hop, classical, jazz, blues, pop, new age even, I have yet to ever come across a band in any of these groups that absolutely offends my auditory senses on the level of \\"The Killers\\".<br /><br />If you buy this album you are doing yourself and the world a disservice. Yourself because you're wasting money and the world because you're keeping these hacks afloat and giving them a reason to keep making music.<br /><br />That's all I have to say. I would give them a negative amount of stars if I could, but unfortunately the lower bound is one. :(
B0006399FS|3.0|i cant beleive im about to give one of the greatest bands a poor review. this is not the album i expected from U2.... first of all, its getting three stars because its U2, not because the songs are worth 3 stars. the reviews i read before this cd came out were all about how it lives up to achtung baby (which i think is their best release). well, it doesn't even come close. i'm sorry guys but there is not even 1 standout track here. i thought after hearing their last album they were about to come up with something brilliant. they havn't.
6305428050|5.0|This has got to be my favorite movie of all time.I've been watching it since I was two and Elizabeth Shue does an amazing job.It has all the elements you could want in a movie.From comedy to adventure,to suspense to romance.You can't find a better movie that everyone can watch together.It is a really good family movie and I have seriously watched it hundreds of times.You can't go wrong with this movie.I promise!!!
0385508417|5.0|With the movie coming out titled, \\"Christmas With the Kranks\\", I was hoping that Tim Allen would actually fit the bill for a Grisham book turned movie. This was great, light, hilarious, and made you think in places.<br /><br />So, yeah, the title does indeed speak for itself, as that is indeed the plan for the Kranks as their daughter, Blair goes to Peru with the Peace Corps. So there will be no turkey, no gifts, no wine, no stupid fruit cakes, no Christmas tree, and no Frosty! You can't read this and can't help but laugh at some of the petty imperfections that practically every family goes through when they get ready for Christmas. Hey, there are some dumb things we do, but we know that the spirit of Christmas is a little bit stronger than stupid family differences! Here Grisham uses a little bit of surprise, yet mostly humor and tradition to make us laugh and smile.<br /><br />But through all the mess, there is a message, along with a little cheer and giving to boot. To all the people who bawled, whined, and boo-hooed because they expected a complex Grisham-like plot: What the heck were you expecting? It isn't little Joe Doe from the South Pole suing Santa's top corporate executive because he didn't get his X-Box! I don't think that negative comments on this will just mess up someone such as John Grisham. He knows who he is, and this is a classic! I personally am glad that it was more than that, and it didn't have to be complicated.<br /><br />So, for those with an open mind, enjoy this holiday treat along with some eggnog and Christmas cookies! If you don't like eggnog, coffee will do!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Finally a Christmas movie worth raving about.  Will Farrell's protrayal of Buddy, the innocent human elf is outstanding.  Why is it that comedic acting is never recognized by the Academy?<br /><br />With all the laughs I shared with my 11 year old son, I didn't even mind the corny ending.  This is one of those films that a family can make into a traditional Christmas viewing.
B0006399FS|5.0|It's funny how people ridicule this line and the silly things Bono says in \\"Vertigo,\\" and its the same people when u2 release a political song say \\"God, can't they just lighten up and relax?\\"  Sometimes you can't satisfy music listeners. <br />What a great return by the greatest band in the world. <br />It was four years, and well worth the wait.  Can't wait to see them on tour, cause any u2 fan knows that when the songs get even better.  My Grade: B+
B0000CE742|5.0|This is as close as you can get to having all of Cher's hits in one place. Only one Top-40 hit (\\"You Better Sit Down Kids\\") is missing. The rest are here, and they sound fabulous! Forget about the U.S. version of this album; this is the one you want!!
B000002KAT|5.0|Do yourself a favour and buy this. Do yourself a bigger favour and reserve judgement on it until you've played it at least 10 times. This is the most beautiful album ever made.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The special effects are great and the acting is tolerable for the type of movie (mindless entertainment).  If they had stayed away from the politics angle and just said the disasters were caused by a meteor hitting the north pole or something similar, it would not have come off so hokey. <br /> <br />Trying to tie in the current administration (the Vice President sure does look like Cheney) with all the stuff about the Kyoto treaty just made the movie look stupid.  Note to the writers..when writing a fantasy film, don't include the DNC talking points and make it seem like the Republicans are trying to cause the world to end. It makes you look petty and ruins your movie.  <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I've loved U2 for 20 years...I can remember being a 14-year-old kid carefully saving up the money to buy my vinyl copy of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" in 1984, and I've followed their ever-evolving career and unique music ever since.  They lost me with \\"Pop,\\" but regained my attention with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  I rejoiced when I heard that album, and though it was no \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"War,\\" it was a step in the right direction.  And now, 20 years after I was introduced to this great band, they come out with what I think is one of their best, most cohesive albums yet.  This music is gorgeous!  It's a blast of color and light in the otherwise dull, unimaginative, grey world that contemporary rock music has become.  I love every song, and this is the first U2 album I've listened to where I instantly like every single song...all their other albums had songs that had to grow on me for awhile.  In my opinion, Bono's voice has never sounded better.  I like the personal insight of the lyrics, especially \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,\\" written for Bono's father.  The music is beautiful and HUGE.  Edge, Adam and Larry are in top form here, and the production is brilliant.  Really, I can't say enough good things about \\"Atomic Bomb\\"!  Go out and get yourself a copy and enjoy!
B0006399FS|1.0|It's hard to explain how bad this CD.  After the first 2 songs this disc takes a nose dive like no other.<br /><br />How a band with so much talent can turn out such a piece of crap is beyond me. Pull out the Joshua Tree and relive the good old days.
0920668364|1.0|The book starts out sweet, but becomes very odd as the characters age.  It has a geriatric mother climbing in the window of her adult son to rock him to sleep.  The first time I read this book to my daughter I cried at the manipulative ending.  This frightend my daughter so much that she never wanted to hear the book again.  It's too weird and too sentimental.  I accidentally picked up a halloween book by the same author that also had a very bizarre plot.  I think he's a little off.
B0006399FS|5.0|On first listen to this album I was more impressed with it than ATYCLB.  But that doesn't say much because I was never really that impressed U2s last album.  Their last album sounded stuck together and broken.  Like Bono wasn't sure he wanted to be writing what he wrote, or like not quite being able to say what he wanted to say. This album is the opposite.  The music flows again the way U2 always did and every word Bono sings sounds like it comes from his soul.  Out of all the U2 albums this one probably says the most.  It adresses the way society has become less close in recent times and the new world ideas of beauty and love.  In a way it tells us all what we already know, we are not releasing our love by living this new way but keeping it under control.  This album is not a cool alternative music album or a catchy, mindless rock album, but it doesn't have to be. It is a U2 album and it is precisely the way it is meant be. <br /> <br />Best songs: Original of the species, Sometimes you can't make it, One step closer
B0002XDODU|5.0|Over the years, rammstein has become known as the largest industrial metal band in all of germany and a majority of America upon the release of 'Herzeleid' and 'Sehensucht' (gone double platinum from germany and the U.S.). They released such power and ferocity which the world had not seen before...such in fact, that they sent metallica reeling upon an opening for one of their concerts.  <br /> <br />What many see as their pride; Mutter was no diffrent. Seen by most fans as the peak of their career...the best...their masterpiece. Reise Reise has in no way faultered from this. In Mutter's stead is left a dark heavy expectation...Reise Reise in turn offers a comfortable balance of fluidic melody, not to be confused with false speculation. <br />While there are still the fringes of good heavy influence in the songs: 'Stein um Stein,' 'Mein Teil,' 'Reise Reise,' and specificaly 'Dalai Lama,' --a favorite to many, there are yet deeper pieces which they have seen fit to display. 'Los,' 'amour amour,' and 'Ohne Dich' offer a lighter, somewhat more persoal side of the band. They have dared to push the bounds and created a bluesy effect with los, with its harmonical and jazzy riffs. Amour Amour gives a soft--yet very strong outlet for Till as Ohne Dich runs a peaceful sonnet. <br />In all, this cd is a roller coaster, of rhythem, voice and beat. Those who appriciate Rammstein for their diversity, detailed guitar riffs, and Till's deep hearty voice will love Reise Reise. This is another corner stone in Rammstein's venture, though it be a bit off the beaten path. <br /> \\"By the third album a band knows weather or not it will make it.\\" ~Vocalist: Till Lindemann  <br />They will not be denied, not now, only those with daring and sheer drive can produce such stunning variety as this. So by all means, Reise Reise surely is diffrent...not lost.
0790729652|5.0|A few reviews down, you'll see someone named \\"Leonard Snerdley\\" wrote a negative review on the 1989 Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams untimate fu*#@^$ CLASSIC, Batman!!!  This guy is what I like to call ANTIQUATED!!! Get a life dude, no one wants to see those crappy villians you mentioned, let alone see \\"Pow's\\" and \\"Zap's\\" on the screen. So just stay home and watch Adam West by yourself with your left hand ready, and of course, some Liquid Silk®!!
B0006FFRW0|5.0|This is one of the best re-issues to date. The 5.1 and advanced surround mixes are A+, which is what one would expect from Trent Reznor. Im assuming you know how good The Downward Spiral is , so i wont go into to that, suffice to say, it rates as one fo the best albums of the 90's and one of my personal favorites, this album got me through many a breakup and hard time.  Ive never heard NIN sound so good, i do have the concert dvd so i knew beforehand how good this medium can sound in surround, but in album form its breathtaking. Sounds revolve around me and im hearing things ive never heard before, it makes me wish more albums were mixed in 5.1  The clarity of the sound is as such you can hear him draw breath before some verses and the difference between this and a regular cd is that with a cd you always sort of know that its a cd playing...with this if you close your eyes its like the band itself if playing in front of you. Industrial/electronic music like this is perfect for surround because of all the layers of sound and this , i promise you will not dissapoint. It blows most of the trash on today out of the water.'The extras are the best ive encountered of all the dvd's i have... in the discography , there is one or two songs (in cd quality) you can listen to from each album! Considering the amount of albums,singles and remix projects NIN has , this is quite a bonus, also you get concert footage from both his previous dvd's.  To top it off there are 3 vidoes on this...closer (in  stereo and surround), march of the pigs and hurt. Considering i paid less for this than most dvd's out now, it has to be the best value for money musicwise i got all year....very highly recommended...enjoy!
B00005U11Z|5.0|I urge everyone to get this DVD...it has brought hours of happiness to me...even my son likes to watch it!! Steve Augeri and the boys as always put on a great show..JOURNEY ON!!!!
0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves is many things, but your standard novel it most certainly is not.  Just flipping through it's 700+ pages in a book store will tell you that.  Some pages have footnotes placed in the center of the page, in addition to being written backwards.  Some pages have words written diagonally.  And some pages have as few as one word on them.  Sounds a little imtimidating eh?  Well, it most certainly can be.   <br /> <br />Mark Z. Danielewski has written quite a novel.  Perhaps the best way to describe the style is if say, Nabokov decided to write suspsense novels.  Make any literay connections you'd like, but please do not listen to anyone who even mentions the Blair Witch Project in the same sentence as House of Leaves.  Such comparisons are made simply for people who would be unable to make a more intelligent, or accurate, one of their own. <br /> <br />Ok, so here's a basic rundown of the book. <br /> <br />House of Leaves consists of two main stories; that of Will Navidson, a photojournalist who moves with his family into an abnormal house that seems to be larger on the inside than it is on the outside.  Hallways and doors appear out of nowhere, as well as lead to nowhere.  He documents these abnormalities, as well as his expeditions into the endless hallways, and complies the tapes into \\"The Navidson Record\\". <br /> <br />Then we have Johnny Truant, a 20-something low life living in Los Angeles.  Upon searching the apartment of a recently dead blind man named Zampano, Truant discovers a compilation of various notes based on the film \\"The Navidson Record\\".  Truant becomes obsessed with the work, and makes it his life goal to put together the pieces of Zampano's unfinished novel. <br /> <br />that is the story, in a very basic nutshell.  The book is far, far deeper than this, and requires numerous reads to fully grasp, but boy is it enjoyable.  If nothing else, one must admire MZD's creativity.  Countless footnotes telling the reader to refer to books thatdo not exist, to essays written by people who do not exist, it is easy to see why this book took over a decade to write.   <br /> <br />It's not an easy read; chapters dealing anything from the origin of echoes to the mythology of Theseus and the Minotaur of Crete, casual readers will NOT be able to finish this beast.  But those willing to explore its pages will find an amazingly deep book full of symbolism, and just plain good old fashioned writing.
B0006399FS|1.0|Quizs muchos de los fans, incluyndome, que haban estado pasivos y resignados con All That You Can't Leave Behind, perdieron la paciencia. Es que hemos estado esperando por 7 aos por algo novedoso, provocativo, grandioso e inolvidable. Incomprensiblemente, luego del xito de ms de 9 millones de copias de Pop, U2, aquella llama inolvidable se extingui para siempre, quedando slo unos viejos rockeros tratando de parecer jvenes. U2 ha criticado despiadada e incomprensiblemente a su trabajo ms vanguardista de todos: Pop diciendo que no estaba bien terminado, o cosas as. Pero la verdad es que Pop nos dej un excelente sabor de boca a millones de fans. U2 sin embargo opt por el camino fcil, sealar que volveran a los tiempos musicales de Joshua Tree y que dejaran la lnea ms arriesgada y electrnica, volviendo a las guitarras y el rock ms crudo. Muchos fans, demasiados fans, cayeron en la trampa. All That You Can't Leave Behind fue el inicio de la decadencia musical de U2, con un producto elaborado pero carente de toda intensidad U2 vendi 11 millones de copias y obtuvo 7 premios Grammy. Hizo luego una gira sin mayores costos econmicos ni produccin, para obtener ms ganancias. Luego editaron un horroroso \\"Best Of\\", en donde adems de asesinar canciones como Discotheque, Staring At The Sun o Gone, no incluan tremendos xitos como Lemon o The Fly. Con ello se dieron el lujo de ganar ms grammy. Ahora re-editan All That You Can't Leave Behind bajo el nombre de How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, una ensalada de viejos esquemas musicales y probadas frmulas de xito bajo la seguridad comercial del sello All That You Can't Leave Behind. Este nuevo disco es sumamente fcil, comercial, pegajoso y vaco. Aqu no hay momentos como Pride ( in the name of love ), With Or Without You, Bad, Sunday Bloody Sunday u otros clsicos. No hay nueva msica como en Zooropa, Pop o Achtung Baby. Nada de eso, slo hay 11 comerciales para MTV y los premios Grammy. Es cosa de ver la nula preocupacin por el arte del disco, con una foto tomada a ltima hora, con una produccin que es irrelevante e innecesaria, con una mesquina duracin de apenas 49 minutos, etc. <br />Sinceramente, me enfurece mucho este camino seguro y comercial que ha explotado U2 desde All That You Can't Leave Behind. qu viene ahora? una nueva gira Elevation Tour II, un nuevo DVD \\"en vivo\\", un nuevo Best Of... por favor !!
B0006399FS|4.0|First of all, this is a really good album, and it is better than the majority of the other stuff that is coming out today.  If I was ranking it against other contemporary music, I would give it a five without any hesitation.    U2 is one of the greatest bands currently out there, and one of the best ever for that matter.  When I heard the band's statements about how this album was going to be their first true foray into Rock N Roll, I was excited.  I was expecting an album similar to Pop, but not pop music, instead rock music.  Vertigo had me very intrigued, but when I listened to the entire album, I was initially disappointed.  Where was that strong, guitar driven, rock feel?  I realized that this album was really \\"All You Can't Leave Behind 2.\\" Once I made that listening adjustment, I was thoroughly pleased with the album.  The songs are for the most part, slower, but that is not a bad thing.  The last three songs, One Step Closer, Origin Of The Species, and Yahweh are completely satisfying, with that classic Joshua Tree sound to them.   Origin Of The Species in particular is an awesome song, a new classic.    The album gets a 6 or 7 from me on a 10 point scale.  I gave it four stars because these Amazon ratings are inflated, and I did not want to turn anyone away from buying this great album.  It may not be a AAA title like Achtung Baby, but it is still worth a listen.  There is a lot to be liked on this release, and you can tell that these songs are begging to be played live.
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm listening to this album for the first time now as I write this.  I've read some of the reviews, both good and bad.  So far so good.  'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' will end up being one of those classic U2 tunes.  I'll be playing this continually today to soak up the lyrics and lose myself for a while.  For those that have panned this I guess you probably won't like U2 anytime soon so perhaps there are other artists out there that can satisfy your needs. As for me, I'll stick with them.  Peace out!
B0006399FS|3.0|A brief history of U2 through the ages:  The first age, the post-punk/new-wave debut from Boy through War.   The second age, an exploration of Americana from the Unforgettable Fire to R&H.  The third age, a totally unexpected dive into euro-trash de-constructionist disco, Achtung Baby to Pop.  And now, we're two albums into the fourth age of U2, which I would call \\"the age of distillation.\\" <br /> <br />Regrettably, I feel the fourth age of U2 with ATYCLB and now HTDAAB is less a \\"return to rock-and-roll form\\" than a quiet acceptance of formula.  It seems that the band (at least for now) has refined its sound to such a point, that it could release a reading of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and go platinum.  Fine for those of us who swoon at every Eno-inspired guitar chime.  But there needs to be more, something we haven't heard before, or at least delivered with complete belief and conviction. <br /> <br />HTDAAB may be a white flag thrown up by the band... not one of defiance (as at Red Rocks) but one of acceptance, of retirement, yeilding to popular expectation -- a sign of maturity as the \\"rock veterans\\" gear themselves towards R&R Hall of Fame induction (?).  No more curve balls, no more bumpy rides, past the rebellion of youth, past the introspection of mid-life crises, settling down into a steady stride towards the sunset.  Say it ain't so.  <br /> <br />Is Bono telling us he surrenders to the demands of millions of U2 fans worldwide?  They've gone back to Steve Lillywhite, they've played \\"I will Follow\\" and \\"11 OClock, Tick Tock\\" at shows.  Forget the new, forget the else, let's just give them what they expect.  A fan's ultimatum that may be echoed in the mumbled bridge of \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All of this can be yours. Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt.\\" <br /> <br />I've listened to \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" all week, letting it wash over, letting it sink in.  I think there are some strong points, some good riffs, some clever lines, some genuine sentiment.But I can't help but feel those moments to be too brief and scarce to call this one a \\"classic.\\"  Is it a good U2 record?  Sure, is there a truly \\"bad\\" one?  And any fan (from any age) will find satisfaction here, since each track harkens to an earlier age, an earlier song.   <br /> <br />My desire (and last remaining hope) is that these tracks will evolve as the band goes on the road.  Another strength of U2 is that they are one of the few pop/rock acts that routinely change the arrangement and performance of their songs, even the really popular ones.  I'd imagine this helps keep the songs somewhat fresh for the band, year after year.  Moreover, it allows the band to re-work that which didn't quite come together in the studio.  Add to that the immediacy and energy of a live performance and these songs could grow to be much more successful.      <br /> <br />As it stands, I give the record 3 1/2 stars at this point (understanding that U2 albums seem to age like wine, growing sweeter and stronger with time).  Is it worth buying, sure... it's U2 for crying out loud!  As pop music goes, no-one does it better.
B0002YLC24|5.0|A brilliant sequel to the quiet 1994 masterpiece, \\"Before Sunrise.\\" Richard Linklatter is a really clever, soulful filmmaker.  He sure fooled us with the start of the film: both actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy look haggard and thin at the start of the film, their attempts at clever repartee seems stilted and false, and we thought: oh crap, are they both over the hill?  Is this movie going to suck, or is Linklatter doing that on purpose?  Well, he was doing it on purpose.  The movie works.  It's great.  If you liked (or loved) the first film, this followup is no disappointment.  Check it out.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 is the memory of a great band that could change the music from the 80's and the 90's. Now, submerged in such superficiality, they give to us this \\"ATYCLB Reloaded\\".Unlike which it would be logical, U2 appears like an immature band for teenagers with easy songs destined to attract more and more fans, forgetting to older fans that have followed them all life, this U2 is sold for the Grammy and the Pop style life. The 11 songs have no new musical world neither transmit new ideas nor new images, they only are a pretext for a new tour and more and more cash. <br />Overall this is a surrogate band that has refuzed to make an effort in trying something new and different, continuing ATYCLB, which was the worst U2 disc ever.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Ok, yet again i don't have this cd, but i have listened to the whole thing over my friends house...one word explains this CD...EXCELLENT. I hope my review helps you, and that you go out and go out and buy it!!
B00006JIA4|1.0|I have Greatest Hits I & II. These 2 compilations are the best rock you'll ever listen to.    Adding a so-called Greatest Hits # 3 to the other two is a travesty.    The only song that can be rescued from CD # 3 is \\"Great Pretender\\" and it's not even a Queen song.    Don't buy this thing. Go for Greatest Hits 1 & 2. You won't need more.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok, well I don't have this CD yet, but I am hoping to get it for Christmas...I have listened to the whole CD at my friends house, and it is ABSOLUTELY AWSOME! IT ROCKS!! You must buy it! It is worth every single penny!!! My favorite song on this CD is, Jesus of Suburbia..The drums in this song are wicked awsome man!! Another great song is Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Letterbomb, two excellent songs! American Idiot is everybody's favorite, so I dont have to comment on that one. But still, if you are not even a Green Day fan, you will absolutely LOVE this CD, it is their best yet!! I LOVE GREEN DAY!
B00005JMAH|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is easily my favorite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter.<br /><br />In the movie, we see things that were not in the book, but could have been. From a simple and quick scene of the boys in Gryffindor trying candies that make them sound like different animals, to the very vocal shrunken heads that show up on the Knight Bus and in the town of Hogsmeade, and to the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes made to Hogwarts itself, we get little glimpses into this world that we haven't seen before, even if we've read all of the books cover to cover and back again.<br /><br />With that in mind, \\"Azkaban\\" is remarkably faithful to the book. The core of the story is there, and the characters really come to life. Some of the details are glossed over, and one of our family's favorite minor characters, Sir Cadogan, is given short shrift (take heart, he does show up in the deleted scenes). Nevertheless, the humor of the book and the essential nature of the characters and the story are captured in this film almost perfectly.<br /><br />Running heavily throughout this film is the theme of time. Anyone who's read the book already knows why this is, but from the moment the students get to Hogwarts one can't help but notice the gigantic pendulum swinging back and forth in the entrance hall, or the massive gears of a clock, always moving, in the big window at the front of the school. The change of seasons is also handled in a very clever visual motif. In the last 20 minutes or so of the film time is an even stronger presence, as even the music takes on a steady rhythm, like the ticking of the clock. Time, its passage and its usage, is a very important theme to this story, and the film makes good use of it.<br /><br />In terms of the technical aspects, \\"Azkaban\\" also makes a standout impression. The visual effects really do the story justice, and are seamless rather than a distraction. Even more than that, the design of the film really captures both the wonders and the horrors of Harry Potter's world. The changes made to the look of Hogwarts work to its benefit, and the design of Trelawney's classroom fits her personality perfectly. The design of the Dementors, on the other hand, is absolutely blood-chilling -- even more frightening than I had imagined them. The acting, particularly that of the kids, has undergone vast improvements, and the addition of talents like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black certainly didn't hurt. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was David Thewlis, who portrayed Professor Lupin perfectly.<br /><br />I've been pretty harshly critical about John Williams' music for the previous two Potter films, as I felt that his work for them was bland and unremarkable, and the series deserved better. Finally, for the third film, we got it. Williams' music for \\"Azkaban\\" is rich and adds depth to the story. At times he adopts a classical, almost baroque style in the music, while at others he allows it to be more whimsically modern. The music for the last twenty minutes or so, with the aforementioned theme of time worked into it, is one of the best pieces I've heard from Williams in a long time. My hat is off to John Williams for finally giving Harry Potter the music he deserves.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron, who takes the directing helm for \\"Azkaban,\\" has really done something amazing. Throughout the film he walks the fine line between the scary aspects of the story (very scary indeed) and the humorous ones (very funny indeed), so that neither seems out of place, even when they're happening in the same scene. His attention to detail is outstanding, and the result is that we see in \\"Azkaban\\" many complex scenes with multiple events happening at once. The main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming. These things add to the effect I mentioned earlier, of exploring the world of Harry Potter more fully while still telling the story. For the first time in this film one really gets a feeling for the richness and breadth of that world, as we have already seen in the books.<br /><br />The DVD presentation is on a par with the other two. Though there is no puzzle aspect to this one as the first one had (I kind of liked that), there are plenty of extras to be found on the second disc, including five deleted scenes, games, and lots of interviews. The film itself is reproduced gorgeously, and the audio plays crystal-clear.<br /><br />My family and I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter films immensely, but for me, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the first movie in the series that I felt truly lived up to the book, not only because it stayed true to the essentials of the story, but also because it felt free to explore new aspects of the world of Harry Potter. Part of the magic of the books is that they give us new wonders to enjoy, and finally we have a film that weaves the very same spell.main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming.

B0006399FS|5.0|I bought the CD yesterday when it released and LOVE it. This album represents what has made U2 a great band! Pure rock and roll. The band's staying power is again exhibited in this offering. If you like \\"Joshua Tree\\", \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" you will like this CD. \\"Pop\\" it is not, for which I am glad. Buy it and enjoy!
B0002TT0NW|1.0|I have been a devoted Harry Potter fan for years. This movie almost made me cry! What on earth happened to Hogwarts?!!Where did all the colours go?!! Why do I have to watch a black and white \\"old photo\\" style reproduction of my magical world?!! Where did all the magic go? Why are all the children wearing sweatshirts in class?!!I mean come on, this IS a British boarding school, children DO wear uniforms there! <br /> <br />I never loved this book for its realism, I always loved it because it gives me a magical world so different from my own! I miss the clutter of Diagon-alley (why was it turned into a train station?), I miss the luscious green lawns of Hogwarts, but most of all I miss the feeling of intimacy and warmth that was the result of all the close-ups in the first two movies.  <br /> <br />Please, please bring back Chris Columbus!
B00067BBQE|5.0|I bought this dvd the first day it came out...and i must say i loved it! The bloopers + the behind the scene footage...you'll get a good laugh. The concert footage was amazing aswell. If your a big fan of Ev...like i am, you'll love this dvd!
B0006284JQ|5.0|Wow! I' ve been waiting for this album since the day i heard for the first time \\"...Baby One More Time.\\" This album is amazing it contains all of the Britney Hits. From the megahit \\"...Baby one more time\\" to the latest singles \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\". The three new songs shows the techno-pop music that Britney is trying to do but aren't her best tunes. \\"My Prerogative\\" is just to \\"Chill Out\\" like she said in one of her letters in her website, is a really bad song, well at least i don't like that song, is just useless in this album but the rest is amazing.  <br /> <br />About the bonus CD just 2 songs are worth it: The Hi-Bias Remix of \\"Everytme\\" that shows that this song is better in a dance beat, and the Chris Cox Megamix That is a remix of the best tunes of Britney(...baby one more time;(you drive me)crazy;I'm a slave 4 u;Oops! i did it again;Evertime;Overprotected and Toxic.) <br /> <br />I like the deluxe package of this album, i think is great.The pictures are not at all \\"never-seen-pictures,\\" but are worth it. The collage shows how a really good fan of Britney should decorate his/her room. And i like the pictures of all of her singles covers. <br /> <br />Well, maybe this could be the last Britney album and if it isn't, well we have to wait al least 2 or 3 years to hear new music of the QUEEN OF POP. <br />                            Hasta la vista, Baby <br />                            Bebito, El Santoz <br /> <br />*Get the Greatest Hits: My Prerogative DVD. Is the best music DVD I'd ever seen. (hint: watch the \\"Toxic\\" video in alternative version)
B00005U11Z|5.0|To start with, Steve Augeri is an awesome performer, Neal Schon smokes and his fingers move so fast that I play the DVD in slow motion which helps me with my guitar work. Ross Valory brings life to my subwoofer. Jonathan Cain plays the piano beautifully and his keyboarding is truely ear candy, and Deen Castronova is the greatest drummer on the face the earth.  Seriously, You have to get this DVD. <br /> <br />3rdWHEELinTHEsky
B000002KET|5.0|This album is widely recognized as Sabbath's best work EVER. At various times I have agreed with that sentiment - but finally I have decided that it comes in at number 2 behind Sabotage.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this album is a life-changing event. Sabbath could have released the title track alone and it would still be considered a classic album. Sabbath holed up in a castle, threw out all previous conventions they created and uniformly created this colossal amount of metal.<br /><br />Hidden favorite is `Looking For Today' - an overlooked song that embodies the amazing Sabbath in yet another new musical venture.<br /><br />You need to but this album - from the cover art to the last seconds of play time, you will not be disappointed.
0553573403|4.0|This is more a fictional medieval history than a fantasy novel.  It is a very interesting story. Martin creates a vast world from which the story unfolds.  One look at the appendix of characters and you'll understand that 1000's of pages over many books are on the way.  This story could go on as long as sales are strong or until the Author decides enough is enough and kills off the last of several hundred characters.<br /><br />It is the story of the fight for the throne in a fictional land.  There is a lot of killing, raping, whoring, lying, plotting, killing, cheating, killing and scheming.  The best part is the killing.  Martin's description of some of the fighting is excellent.<br /><br />It is well written and captivating.  You really want know what happens next.  And you will have to read 1000's more pages to find out.  I have.  And really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Don't get too enamored with a favorite character.  He could die on any page...
B0006399FS|5.0|You would have to be emotionally retarded not to be moved by this breath taking album. This is the best U2 album since The Joshua Tree and for me song for song it sits along side it as a master piece. Atomic Bomb is littered with majestic melodic chiming guitars lifting you up in classics such as City of Blinding Lights, Miracle Drug, Original of the Species, and Yahweh. Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own is for me the best thing they have ever written. If you like the U2 sound you cannot fail to fall in love with this Album.  <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|This album immediately recommends itself. It's explosive. The Edge's guitar work is unrestrained. Bono's vocals soar. And the rythym drives How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. This album stands alongside War, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, and it will be remembered as the great come back album from the band that never left center stage. Passionately recommended.
B0006399FS|5.0|Anybody giving this album less than 3 stars is not giving it a fair chance.  I've listened to it about 5 times since I bought it yesterday and already it has grown on me.   <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own has grown on me the most, which makes me think this will be a \\"classic\\".  All Because of You and Crumbs From Your Table will be a great concert songs.  I think one of these two songs, or maybe Vertigo, will be the opening song for the next tour.   <br /> <br />Anyways, I give it five (5) stars because there are 7 or 8 very good songs, a few great songs, and at least one \\"classic\\".   <br /> <br />
B00068IOWC|5.0|How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb comes in three varieties: <br /> <br />1. regular <br />2. deluxe (this edition) <br />3. book & CD <br /> <br />This version gives you the bonus CD, which is pretty good. Interesting little documentary about the album, some videos and a clever performance of Vertigo. As stated in my review of the \\"regular\\" edition, the Bomb rocks. Definately add it. But perhaps fork out a few bucks more, get the book edition and get \\"Fast Cars\\" too.
B00068IOWC|4.0|I was excited for the new album. Bono stated that Edge was picking up the guitar and just ripping into it. However, I was a bit disappointed that the hardest song in the album was vertigo. The rest of the songs in the album are beautiful, but they are more airplay friendly than anything. The cool thing about U2 is the fact that they defined and created new sounds within every album. They brought the folk sound to the mainstream with Joshua Tree, they brought the industrial sound into the open with Achtung Baby, the brought the artistic futuristic in Zooropa in to the mainstream and in Passengers they showed everyone what experimentation was and how as a band, they had no limitations. POP, though a half finished had the raw guitar and drumming that started in War, got lost throughout the 80's and got back on achtung baby. However, the new decade came back and it was as if U2 went back to an old formula...The joshua tree. The Joshua tree is a pinnacle in music history. However, when you try to imitate that same sound in every record so you have a hit, you limit yourself and compromise on your sound and artistic freedom. Original of A Species...Crumbs off your table...Miracle Drug are the most heart felt songs in the album.  <br />Based on what Bono stated I expect and album to sound like: Mysterious ways, Gone, Bullet the Blue Sky, New Years Day ect...I was expecting an full on rock guitar alert.  <br /> <br />Out of the 11 songs in the album 8 of them can be airplay friendly and singles. It's a good album by all accounts, but it's not an album that defies the mainstream or the sound that's out there. It's a heartfelt album with beautiful lyrics and compositions.  <br />PS. Larry has always wanted to finish Pop. I think U2 should finish Pop. I think it would be such an incredible album fans and non-fans would actually buy it.  <br />
1591840562|5.0|I am in the process of starting a business and was getting a bit bogged down in the details.  Guy's book was enlightening in that it presented the startup process in a very simple, yet quite profound way and has given me the tools I need to \\"cut the crap\\" and get it done.    In addition to the primary chapters dedicated to the process itself, the final chapter \\"The Art of Being a Mensch\\" was outstanding.    Highly recommended - thanks, Guy, for such a wonderful book.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Awesome movie. BUT VERY CHAEP PACKAGING. Attention collectors the packaging of this movie is different from the first two Harry Potter. Why????? Warner did not give any good care on this one cause they knew that the consumers would buy it anyway to complete the collection. BAD MARKETING!!!!
B0006399FS|4.0|To all giving this album bad review...ask your self do you expect anything else from u2 at this point in thier carrer? The expiremental 90's are over, and I for one welcome the return to form, all be it a safe one. This is what I expect from then at this point in thier carrer...At least they avoid embarassment  unlike a lot of bands of thier age or older still making records..Stones,  and hate to say  it, Rem.  With most of them in thier 40's, it would be embarrasing for them to try and do what they were doing in thier 30's....What would they be doing trying to sound like System of a down? I love Pearl jam...but if you listen to the last 2 Pearl Jam albums, they stick to a format, and play it safe.
B0006FFRW0|3.0|this is the album i have been waiting for since the advent of DVD-A and SACD. i bought both releases, and tried the dualdisc first. immediately you will notice, if you have a subwoofer that is, that if it hasnt already been destroyed by the ridiculous amount of bass trent added to almost all of the tracks, it will definately overuse it. some of the bass additions sound good, particularly the guitar in mr. self-destruct. however, the majority of the time, the bass notes almost completely drown out the vocals and other instruments. this would probably sound great on a system with a small subwoofer, but i've got a 12\\" and will be listening with it turned off for the most part. i haven't tried the SACD yet, i'm hoping it's not the same audio on a different medium, because SACD has better bass management. be forewarned, do not turn the volume up to your usual DVD-A listening level for loud listening, because it starts off sounding perfect, but about 10 seconds into track 1, you will probably be losing or damaging a speaker if your system is setup properly.
B0006399FS|3.0|HTDAAB has its strengths and weaknesses, however I have found in my 20+ years of being a devoted U2 fan that I can never listen to an album of theirs mereley a few times before appreciating their artistic ambition.  I hated Achtung and didn't know how to approach it the first day I bought it.  Now I think it is one of the most brilliant albums ever recorded.      However, I do miss their quest for innovation in this new album as well as in ATYCLB.  Maybe POP was a little too over the edge for the mainstream and the old school U2 fans, but I enjoyed their quest for new sounds, and actually played a couple of POP songs at a party recently.  People all asked who it was and a couple of people were inspired to buy the album.    U2 faces this challenge of being mainstream to be more commercially viable or to be more on the edge & experimental.  I suggest a compromise of putting a couple of songs on an album that push the envelope more a bit than fitting the formula of its recent work.  They have taken a step back from reinventing themselves to more of fitting a mold. Why can't we have a little of both?
B0006399FS|1.0|Why so many fans think with albums like ATYCLB and this one HTDAAB 80's U2 is back ?. I think that sentence is pointless, there's no way for U2 to return to these days. U2 in the 80's had many things to say, both with music and lyrics, but now...\\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" at the end of Vertigo is something horrible !! by the way, Bono is far from 80's voice. This album is inoffensive, inopportune, accessible, pop, false, and overall the worst possible way to celebrate their 25th birthday. I think a far better way could have been a remastered releasing of all their classic albums, from Boy until Pop, as well Live DVD's with previously unreleased footage ( Like Led Zeppelin DVD ). Is a shame, really. The fans can swallow any U2 hype, just because is something new, but that doesn't mean quality at all. There's no one memorable and unforgettable song here, like Pride ( in the name of love ), Sunday Bloody Sunday, One or Stay. Now is time for re-discovering underrated albums like Zooropa! or Pop, and bury this \\"new\\" U2. How so many fans can be blind, and say this is equal to Joshua Tree, Acthung Baby or Unforgettable Fire ? there's no new music here, no new guitars, no new style, is just another ATYCLB with a few spices by The Edge, but even he sounds like always here. The title was chosen obviously just for typical reviews like \\"this album is a bomb\\" and things like that. The more I listen the album, the more I lament to see what have they done  <br />these last years, wasting all the time staining, soiling, burying and their extraordinary career seeking for instantaneous grammy and money. It's been a long time in which U2 doesn't offer anything really new, neither with LPs nor with the live concerts, but having the great advantage of being a recognized and respected band throughout the world, U2 always will have fans that acclaim anything that they  <br />put on the radios, like this stupid \\"bomb\\".The title of this album must have been \\"How to dismantle a band who used to makemusic and surprise the world\\"
B0006284JQ|5.0|It's all worth it even just for that song called \\"Do SOmething\\". If all of her following singles is going to sound like this one and follow this kind of music then she'll definitely continue her success. Not a Britney fan but I love this CD. It's cool.
B0006399FS|1.0|It's no wonder Vertigo was the first release from this album and came out approximately 3 years before the rest of the cd. It's the only listenable track to be found. The rest of How to Put Out A Really Bad CD can best be described as \\"tedious.\\" Every song is slow and boring, and there isn't a hook to be found anywhere. You won't be walking around with any of these songs stuck in your head. They are that unremarkable. Oh well, U2 has put out bad work before (see my review of Achtung Baby), perhaps a few years from now they will put out someting decent. If not, they can count this CD as the first in their eventual box set titled \\"How To Dismantle a Rock Career.\\"
0765309408|5.0|[...]  I finished a prerelease copy of Old Man's War the other night, and I gotta say-it's fantastic. Truly. It's an excellent read, combining the breezy pacing of Heinlein's space operas, the grit of Haldeman's Forever series and the seat-of-the-pants approach to revolutionary ideas that made Philip K. Dick's stories so ripe for poaching by Hollywood.     Plus, it's damn funny.     The fundamental humanity of the book is, I think, what's going to make some waves in the sci-fi community. So much of recent sci-fi is about lit'rary style-at the expense of the story and the characters. John knows enough about writing to get out of his own way, stylistically, and let the story tell itself. It's reminiscent of Orson Scott Card's work in its clarity (and, come to think of it, its snappy dialogue), which is, to me, a very significant thing.     This isn't the next Neuromancer. This isn't the next Perdido Street Station. Those are both compliments; John's done something which is, in my opinion, far more difficult than crowbarring \\"edgy\\" prose or freebasing surreal (and thus almost entirely inaccessible) universes: He's written a story that can touch you.     I think modern sci-fi readers are hungry for something that is both accessible and well-written. Maybe I'm wrong; maybe the market won't give a second glance to a writer who doesn't scream \\"look at what I can do!\\" on every page. But my gut feeling is that the book-especially as a debut novel-will do very, very well. It certainly deserves to.
B000687M48|4.0|Following up the success of their multi-platinum debut \\"Fallen\\" and it's four consecutive hit singles, Evanescence's \\"Anywhere But Home\\" comes in to fill in the gap until the band drops their new album next year. As far as live albums go, this one is pretty solid. The DVD portion is the same concert heard on the audio CD with plenty of bonus footage. In addition to an hour long \\"Behind The Scenes\\" documentary (which is basically just the band screwing off), all four of Evanescence's current video's are included. All of them are very entertaining, original and manage to capture the essence of each song. The concert is pretty standard, but the band manages to pull out a few tricks. In addition to ten out of eleven songs from their debut (\\"Hello\\" is the only omission), the band pulls out an unreleased track, \\"Breathe No More,\\" and an exceptional cover of Korn's \\"Thoughtless.\\" Korn are my favorite band, so Evanescence earn some bonus points in my book for choosing to cover them, and for doing the song justice. The entire concert is taken from the Evanescence/Seether summer tour of this past year, and features new guitarist Terry Balsamo (formerly of Cold -- the guy who always wore Michael Myers masks onstage) in tow. The concert is entertaining enough, and the little surprises mentioned before help elevate the experience, but the band hardly alters any of the compositions (maybe a plus to some people) and relies way too heavily on pre-recorded pieces to perform, which isn't such a crime, as many bands do this, but it definitely makes the show suffer. This is definitely a set intended for the die-hard Evanescence fan, and if you've seen them live, maybe you'll enjoy this more than I did. I know live releases by bands I've seen are always the best, so judge for yourself. The b-side \\"Missing\\" (from the \\"Bring Me To Life\\" single) definitely justifies this purchase for me (the other b-side, \\"Farther Away,\\" is incorporated into the show). All in all, the whole thing will definitely serve as a good distraction until new music from the band emerges. Even though it's not perfect and maybe could have been better (try a few serious interviews & footage next time), I  recommend this to anyone who owns and loves \\"Fallen.\\"nitely serve as a good distraction until new music from the band emerges. Even though it's not perfect and maybe could have been better (try a few serious interviews & footage next time), I  recommend this to anyone who owns and loves \\"Fallen.\\"
B0006399FS|4.0|I feel compelled to write this having read the lousy reports by all the naysayers spelling out U2's demise. The new cd builds on everything that was good about All That You Can't Leave Behind, but clearly it is a new direction with some inspired songwriting. Like All That You Can't Leave Behind this is a mature cd by a mature band. U2 can't redo War, The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree, or Achtung Baby. Constantly evolving is the way U2 has always been, which is how we see them on this album. 4 of 5 stars.
0790729407|4.0|This movie was one of the suggestions I selected from an Amazon \\"page I just created\\"  list.  Having an Irish background, I am sad to say I did not know who Michael Collins was before I purchased this movie.  So I took a look at it from both an educational and entertainment point of view.  In the end I felt it did both, educate and entertain.      Overall I thought the casting was just OK.  I liked Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn, however I didn't care for Julia Roberts as the Kitty Kiernan character for some reason.  I liked the story-line, but I am not sure as to the historical accuracy of this portrayal.  The overall story seemed to have a few gaps in it.      If you enjoy movies like The Patriot, Braveheart, and Gladiator and are looking for entertainment versus authenticity then this is a movie for you.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This is one great rock band, captured live! I had the good fortune to attend the show in Las Vegas and have found this DVD to be faithful to the great performance I saw that night. Absolutely fabulous!!! While not the original line-up or the most celebrated, this group truly brings the music of all Journey's incarnations to life and in grand style. Neal Schon, Ross Valory, Jon Cain, Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo are five very talented musicans who KNOW how to give their audience a truly awesome experience. I enjoy watching this recording and reliving the fine memories of this, and many other Journey shows, that I have been priviledged to attend over the past six years.
076790592X|3.0|My wife purchased this book for me.  I think I fit within the target audience for this book having lost my parents when I was very young.  With that said, If you have had someone close to you die or know someone that has had the unpleasant experience of having to battle for their life, this book may be of some help to you in learning \\"how\\" to interact with them.  Learning to cope with a disease is never easy for the patient or the family and friends.  This book is a good attempt to help each of us do just that - cope.  Here in the Detroit area this book had a lot of hype surrounding it.  It is safe to say, it is a worthwhile read if you are a sports nut and like the other stuff Mitch Album writes.  This gives you another view of Mitch Album that you would not otherwise ever see or hear about.  In my opinion it was weighted more heavily on the first person experience of the author than that of his former teacher. It has some useful advice throughout and makes for a good read (but not great).     My suggestion is to read \\"Life Lessons\\" by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and David Kessler in addition to or instead of this book, you will not be disappointed.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is one of those books that you can pick up at any given time in your life and find a message or a line that will have just the right advice for whatever you are going through. It doesn't preach to the reader, though - you learn while you enjoy Santiago's adventures.  <br /> <br />It's really something that should be on everyone's nightstand.
B00061QK16|5.0|this is one of the best movies of this year,posibly of all time for a lot of people.this movie,anchorman,is definetly a \\"rofl\\"(roling on floor laughing) movie.this is a good movie,but it contains some strong language,so it might be a bad idea to take your kids to see this movie.their are many good and very funny parts,there is the fight seen which was very funny,and then almost every thing else about this film is funny,if you have the chance to see this movie you might instantly fall in love with is movie,i did.
B0006399FS|4.0|I'm giving this album 4 stars because it's full of fantastic songs that will grow on you with each listen. It doesn't get 5 stars because I give those reviews to Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, however, HTDAAB is a great piece of work from one of my favorite bands, Buy the album. And jeezus people, would you listen to the album more than once before you call it \\"horrible\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|Everyone who likes u2 knows that they are the best live band on the planet, that's where all these songs come to life. Who cares about the album, the songs sound twice as good on stage. I'll even go as far as to say that you can't give a valid point, good/bad, about the band until you see them in concert. That's where their true magic lies. But If I had to comment on the new album, its bloody brilliant.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard of Gavin DeGraw watching my favorite show - One Tree Hill. I loved the theme song and got on WB's website to find out who sang it and what his other songs were like. I have to say, listening to the song Chariot then, I didn't like it at all. <br /> <br />Now its almost Christmas and people want to know what I want. So, remembering that I Don't Want To Be was one of my favorite songs, I decided to check out Gavins cd. And I am glad I did. For some reason, the song Chariot sounded really great to me. Now I love all of the songs on the cd.  <br /> <br />This is truly a great album and Gavin has a great career ahead of him. By next year, he will most likely be in the ranks of top artists.
B00068IOWC|5.0|The single, \\"Vertigo\\" remindes me of some of U2's old stuff a little bit. This is an essential U2 album. Buy It, you won't be sorry!
B0006399FS|5.0|After the last cd disaster, I thought they were through.  They have rebound, and rebirthed into a mystical beast once again.  While listening to this cd, I couldn't help think all their peers from the 80s must be jealous as hell if they are listening, or caring by now.  U2 started as a guitar band and should take their creativity from there.  It's like they have returned back to an old love and kissed it so hard that they still don't feel sore.<br /><br />Many thumbs-up!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I still remember sitting in the theater in 1983 right after Tony 'wipes out' his boss and Mel.  My mouth was hanging open.  Still have never seen anything so explosively brutal in dialogue in a gangster picture.  I don't mean blood and gore, just the way it all played out in that scene.  And the restaraunt scene is my second favorite.  Could watch this movie 1000 more times.  Favorie camera move - ...from ringing phone...to the clock at 3:00...then to the motionless Frank. <br />Pacino forever.   <br />...Frenchy
B000006YYM|5.0|Okay, this is probably not the GG album for newbies.  I was a fan before, and it took me a while to get into some of the cuts (\\"So Sincere\\" sounded like it was being played at the wrong speed for my 1st 20 or so listenings!), but it just grew on me until it became my favorite GG album.  \\"The Giant\\" was easily the finest and most intelligent band of the \\"prog-rock\\" era, and this one is just incredible.  From the opening \\"Proclamation\\" to Derek Shulman's primal scream of \\"Must be a REASONNN...  Why things HAVE turned around...\\" on the final cut: \\"Valedictory\\", it just doesn't get any better than this.  For the unitiated, try \\"Free Hand\\" first... if \\"Just the Same\\" and \\"On Reflection\\" don't grab you, save your time, you'll never appreciate these guys.  Spectacular musicianship, great non-danceable songs (what in the HELL kind of time signatures do they use???), smart, bitter and satirical lyrics... AHH!  Gotta go and play the CD!!  I was so happy when this and other GG was released on CD, as my vinyl copies are about worn out.  Others worth acquiring (other then the aformentioned \\"Free Hand\\") are \\"Gentle Giant\\", \\"Acquiring the Taste\\", \\"Three Friends\\", \\"Octupus\\", \\"In a Glass House\\" and \\"Playing the Fool/Live\\".  \\"In-ter-view\\" is not bad, but after that BEWARE!!
B00003CXCT|4.0|....OK, i'm not sure any review is going to dissuade or convince someone to buy this set...you're either gonna do it or not. But if you do you won't be dissapointed, Star Wars hold up well in my opinion, the story is the best of the three, great action, interesting characters (losing Alec Guiness hurt the series as a whole imo, he was in a way the heart of the film). 'Empire' has aged even better, and although i expected to be dissapointed by 'Jedi' it wasn't as bad as i remembered and is still head and shoulders over the last two \\"pre-quels\\". (although i still hate the whole 'cute' factor which came about with the furballs) The extras are worth checking out...once. But i'm docking a star for the tweaking Lucas has done on these films...STOP IT! Leave them alone! (although it's not as bad as Spielbergs changing the guns to flashlights bit in ET, the worst example) I'm not thrilled with the packaging but hey, it's the movie that counts!
B0001AP12G|5.0|There really isnt much more to say about it other than this. You all know what Kanye is about, and thats what u get with this CD. I dont know If i picked up an errant album or not though, because the last few songs seemed to be edited? I dont know if anyone else has had that problem, but that is definitely forgiveable because this CD is worth every penny of what I spent on it.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I first saw the trailer to this movie in 2003, I was hooked. I finally saw it when it was released in theaters and I was LITERALLY on the edge of my seat. I've never done that in a movie ever. I'm not going to proclaim this as the best movie EVER, because it definitely is not. But of 2004, it ranks as one of the top 4. Ashton Kutcher finally hits his audience with something completely new and completely out of his shell which I think makes the movie that much better. I thought this movie was pure brilliance till the DVD came out and after watching the Director's Cut I was AMAZED! I can't believe that was not the original version shown in theaters as the ending is purely dramatic and perfect. I'm a man and yes, I did get teary-eyed. It's just completely thought provoking and an amazing adventure for any film lover and avid Sci-Fi fan. It encompasses a lot of psychological material and the DVD extras include tons of bonus material including interviews with real psychologists and their views on the Chaos Theory (better known as \\"the butterfly effect\\").
B00006LWSF|5.0|Eminem will always be the man, and this CD showcased his producing skills too. He managed to put together some nice songs on here, from other noteable artists like 50 cent, jay-Z and of course D-12. This CD first introduced me to 50 cent, and after that I went on to buy his Get Rich CD and have been a big fan of his ever since. And every song that Em is in on this CD are off the hook.  <br /> <br />Great movie and great CD.
B000031WD9|5.0|\\"American Pie\\" is a great movie. It makes me laugh every time I watch it, and the DVD is one of my favorites. All the hilarious extras make it worth buying. <br /> <br />However, I must take umbrage with one detail from the movie: everyone refers to Stifler's Mom (portrayed by the terrific Jennifer Coolidge) as a \\"M.I.L.F.\\" - a \\"Mom I'd Like To [make whoopee with].\\" <br /> <br />Sadly, this is not the proper term to describe an attractive woman who has children. The acronym fails to incorporate the \\"To,\\" which would make it \\"M.I.L.T.F.\\" Grammatically speaking, the true term is \\"M.I.F.\\" - a \\"Mom I'd [make whoopee with].\\" <br /> <br />(In fact, Stifler's Mom, while certainly appealing, does not have the \\"hot soccer-mom\\" look that is most closely associated with the concept).  <br /> <br />The best acronyms make full use of every word in the title, such as \\"V.E.N.O.M.\\", which either stands for \\"Vicious Evil Network Of Mayhem,\\" or \\"Vicious Evil Nemesis Of M.A.S.K.\\" - which is itself an acronym for \\"Mobile Armored Strike Kommand.\\" You've got to forgive the good guys for the misspelling in their name; they're workin' overtime fightin' crime. Fightin' crime! <br /> <br />As a card-carrying M.I.F.ologist, I take my job seriously. It's frustrating that the incorrect acronym has been popularized, making it the preferred form. I realize I'm being pedantic, but it's important that a woman doesn't think you're an ignoramus when you call her a \\"M.I.F.\\" You don't want to look like a loser, do you? <br /> <br />-- cousinpaco
B0000039QA|5.0|An excellent album, plenty of good songs to bump to (especially with a nice car system). A lot of BIG's classics come right off this album. <br /> <br />This album could almost be classified as a BIG's greatest hits CD. (Notorious thugs is one of the best rap songs of all time!!!) <br /> <br />Definitely check this CD out.
B0006399FS|1.0|Step 1, kick him in the crotch and tell him Bono is a coward and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is total crap. Step 2, take his money and spend it on quality Mike Patton records instead of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Step 3, move to the next isle over to where they sell Green Day records and repeat steps 1 and 2, as you did with How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Then pull the Ipods out of their rears and huck them against the wall, oh yeah I hate U2's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  Perhaps I wouldnt hate How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb if I didnt have to hear it and see it every friggin two seconds. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|eso es lo que sucede con este album, es nada ms que un montn de promesas que no se cumplen.  cuntas veces dijo Bono que este album sera el mejor de U2 y todo aquello ?  y vos le creste ?. Me preocupa mucho la actitud de Rock Stars por parte de U2, quienes creen que los fans son unos cabezas huecas que pueden comprar lo que sea bajo el sello de \\"U2\\". Bono y sus pibes suenan como unos veteranos de 60 aos que todava creen que pueden hacer Rock & Roll. Su voz est tan maltratada que es una lstima escuchar A Man And A Woman o Yahweh. Lo peor es que sigue creyendo que su voz es fantstica !!. Aqu no hay lugar para la autocrtica y el reconocer cuando se ha fallado, todo lo contrario, Bono se oculta tras sus lentes de sol creyendo que es un Dios, y por supuesto muchos fans adoran eso, no importando qu es lo que estn escuchando. <br />El sonido es el mismo que el de All That You Can't Live Behind, llegando a ser aburrido, ya que todas las canciones suenan iguales, en guitarras, en la voz y otros instrumentos. No existen diferentes sonidos como Zooropa, Pop o Achtung Baby, y est lejos de cualquier innovacin y desafo musical. Adems muchas veces los arreglos de cuerdas aflojan y hacen ms Pop las canciones. No puedo creer que U2 hayan pasado ms de dos aos haciendo este producto para las radios. Me lamenta ver que los fans una vez ms se comen este producto pre-fabricado y desechable, ideal para msica de fondo con chicos y chicas. Vertigo parece adelantar lo que ser un album potente y feroz, pero lejos de eso el album slo tiene 3 temas Rockeros: Vertigo, Love and Peace Or Else y All Because Of You, por lo que en su gran mayora es un disco tranquilo, montono y aburrido, hecho a la medida para que los fans digan que la rompieron con este album. No s cmo los mismos productores de Acthung Baby o Joshua Tree hagan esta estafa comercial, ya que esto es un robo y un engao para todos los que esperaron \\"el mejor album de U2\\". <br />cmo despus de 4 aos no logran llegar nisiquiera a los 60 minutos de msica?. U2 son inteligentes, saben que con 40 minutos les basta para que los adoren y los amen en todo el mundo, mientras otras bandas se juegan la vida con cada disco, estos viejos dinosaurios pasados de moda no tienen que hacer ningn esfuerzo, tan slo usar las canciones que quedaron fuera de All That You Can't Leave Behind, arreglarlas un poco y lanzar un album para que todos digan que es lo mejor de U2, como siempre.
015670160X|5.0|\\"Orlando\\" is the only Woolf novel that engages in fantasy. The main character, Orlando, lives from the Elizabethan era to 1928 and transforms from a man to a woman somewhere along the way. That detail in itself promises an intriguing plot.     Woolf's prose often resembles poetry, and in \\"Orlando\\" this is no exception. She cleverly renders Orlando's (and the first-person narrator/biographer) feelings and experiences with a myriad of seemingly useless details. It may take some time to get used to and make sense of how these details fit; yet, that is the beauty and brilliance of Woolf's language that makes this novel (and her other works) such a pleasure to read.    \\"Orlando\\" is referred to as Woolf's \\"holiday\\" novel and one that Woolf herself said she wrote in preparation for the next (and often considered best) book, The Waves. While \\"Orlando\\" does seem more light-hearted and comical than her other work, and this is partly due to the fantasy and her use of satire and parody, it can also be quite political in the issues it addresses, particularly those related to gender, literature, and modernity. Orlando as a character conveys her emotions but does not reflect much on their implications. However, we as readers who witness her transformation and her lifestyle, who are made to read to about Orlando's existence and position in the world, would soon find ourselves thinking about Woolf's recurrent themes and how they relate to humanity.    As a whole, \\"Orlando\\" is very thought-provoking. Every time I pick it up, I find something new to marvel at.
B0006399FS|5.0|I know some of the initial reviews were not the hottest on this CD by U2; however, I was very impressed with the song set. Bono's voice is as strong and powerful as ever; and the band is in full form throughout!<br /><br />The album opens with the infectious song \\"Vertigo;\\" this song rocks hard and was featured heavily in recent iPod commercials. Then comes two \\"softer,\\" thoughtful songs entitled \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,\\" the latter being a great ballad. \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is good; but I personally have a preference for \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"All Because Of You\\"--excellent rock songs you will love! Wow! The pace slows a bit with the next song, \\"A Man And A Woman.\\"<br /><br />The following songs \\"Crumbs From Your Table,\\" \\"One Step Closer,\\" \\"Original Of The Species,\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" are also both very well written and performed with thought and great effort. The band's involvement is complete throughout the CD and the listener senses this as they enjoy the song set. In particular, the vocal effects on \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" are very well done--awesome! The ending of \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is phenomenal-practically majestic! Wow! \\"One Step Closer\\" is a slightly shorter song but stunning. GRIN<br /><br />The full lyrics are provided with some great black and white photos of the band members. Song credits are also given. The quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />Get this CD and enjoy it over and over again! You won't regret it! GRIN
0790729725|5.0|There are many gangster films that rank high ratings but this one may just top them all.  We all love to see films about the bad guys and even root for them at times (what's up with that anyway?).  Martin Scorsese gives us an insider's peek at the way gangster life is.  It's full of realisms that you may not find in other crime dramas.  While this film is full of violence, it does not glorify violence but shows you what happens to those who lilve that life.  Live by the sword, die by the sword. <br /> <br />Goodfellas could have been named The Rise and Fall of Henry Hill.  This film is based on his recollections of his former life.  You actually get to see Hill and hear him speak of those days in the special feature section of this dvd.  He does not look at all the gangster we see portrayed but looks are deceiving are they not? <br /> <br />Paul Sorvino is positivley deadly in his role here even though you never see him lift a finger to anyone.  He states that he wasn't comfortable with the role because he wasn't sure how to portray a killer the way he needed to portray him for this film.  The outward appearance was easy but the inside of the man was more difficult.  After having dinner one night he got up to check his face in the mirror and saw a look on his face that literally made him jump back from the mirror.  It was then that he found the look of a killer he was seeking.   <br /> <br />Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci are, as usual, brilliant.  Pesci's character is especially disturbing because he is violent and 100% grade A nuts!  His best seen is probably the one in the bar when he, Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) and others are laughing and telling stories and then suddenly the mood changes on a dime just because Hill tells him that he is funny.  \\"What's so funny about me?  What the @#@#@# is so funny?  Do I amuse you?  Everyone is frozen with fear because they don't know what to expect from this lunatic.  It's a very intense, powerful scene.  Finally, Hill laughs because he realizes that it's a put on and then everyone laughs.  In the special feature section it is revealed that this very same incident really happened to Pesci and Scorsese added it to the film. <br /> <br />Goodfellas contains first rate performances from the whole cast.   <br />It's a must see for those who love the genre.   <br /> <br />Parents please be advised that this is not a movie for children.  There is a lot of violence and foul language.  I advise a viewing age of at least 18.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|There's not much that's original on this one. There's just something vaguely familiar about most of the melodies and the slow numbers just seem to drag. They do seem to excel when they crank up the volume; at least the sheer energy will drag you along. I like it but it does not hold my interest after repeated plays.
B00005JLR8|4.0|New York through the eyes of Irish imigrants.  Very unusual.  This is basically a hard luck story with a sort of keep your chin up attitude.  The family comes to America after the death of a child.  The only place they can find to live is an apartment where crack addicts hang out.  The two daughters played by real life sisters (Sarah and Emma Bolger) give good performances.  The younger of the two is liable to be a fantastic actress if she keeps up with the acting business.      Amoungst the other characters is one that they call the screaming man.  When the sisters go trick or treating, they bang on everyone's door but no one will open up.  Then they bang on the screaming man's door.  At first you fear for them as their strange neighbor, played by Djimon Housau, lets them enter his strange abode.  He screams because of his rage.  He is dying from aids but  when he meets the two little girls you can see that he is harmless and loves the lifeforce that they exude.    Later on in the film, the mom gives birth to another child but the baby is not expected to live.  Somehow the neighbor's death and the baby's birth become entertwined but I won't give it away here.      At times the hard luck issues of the family beome tiresome but this movie is still worth viewing.  It's a lovely tale and would be a great flick to put on when there's absolutely nothing on all of the 6 million channels on cable.    There is very little violence, mild sexual situations and references to drug usage.  I suggest a viewing age of at least 13.
B00005JNDX|2.0|The only reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES movie is because the first one turned out to be pretty good and made itself some money. That's the same reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES book, and there's nothing wrong with using that justification to make a movie.<br /><br />However, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON departs from what made the first film so charming, instead concentrating on the goofball slapstick of Bridget, rather than her inherent \\"Everywoman\\" quality that made her so relatable.<br /><br />Lots of women know what it's like to be stood up for a date or to be lied to by a cad. Hardly any women or other members of the target audience for BRIDGET JONES know what it's like to be under arrest and held in a Thai women's prison. (I also doubt, in that situation, that most women would spend their time choreographing a Madonna number for fellow inmates.) Other women likely aren't going to accidentally end up skiing down a championship racing slope. Or skydive into a vat of pig slop. Or get into another of the groan-inducingly unrealistic situations that the makers of the film put Bridget in.<br /><br />The movie's not like the second novel, either, which has its own set of flaws. The second novel didn't even include the Daniel Cleaver character, but the movie had to find a way to include Hugh Grant - so they threw him in there.<br /><br />The problems of the romance between Darcy and Bridget, like in the book, could be solved if the two of them just sat down and had an open conversation. But, instead, we're treated to the situation - and the movie AND Renee Zellweger's wavering accent - just getting worse and worse.<br /><br />That said, the romance is interesting. Colin Firth is good. Renee Zellweger is good enough. And the movie makes London look awfully pretty.
B0006399FS|2.0|While this record isn't terrible, it is pretty bad for U2 standards. All songs here are mid to slow tempo and quite dull; none of the other 10 tracks have the energy that Vertigo has. Slow songs are not a bad thing, just listen to 'All That You Can't...', but the ones here are just plain boring. I miss the adventurous U2 of the early to mid '90s. In my opinion, this record has been grosely overhyped and thus it's kind of disappointing when you finally get to listen to it. 'All because of you' sounds like a bad rip off of Bowie's 'Hang On To Yourself', 'A Man and A Woman' will put you to sleep faster than a Tool record. Guess all those 4 star reviews from Rolling Stone and the like really are nothing more than maintainace for a business relation. <br /> <br />I'm not just bashing U2 for the sake of it. I think they are one of the greatest bands ever; Achtung Baby and Zooropa are among my favorite records of all time, I throughly enjoy All That You Can't and Joshua Tree, but this time i was genuinely disappointed.
B0006399FS|2.0|I have been a fan of U2 for quite some time. I am not an early album purist. I find all of there albums to have merit, but this one I'm not so sure about. I loved the album \\"Pop\\" and \\"Zooropa\\" grew on me in a big way after quite a few listens. Having said that, I have no problem with them reverting to a more strait-ahead rock sound. I adore their rock albums. The problem I have with this album is that the lyrics seem rushed together without thought. For example, Bono uses the phrase \\"down on my knees\\" or some variation in at least three different songs. I mean, come on, change it up a little. And the phrase \\"freedom smells like the top of a new born baby's head\\" is just a very weak choice, in my opinion. There are about three songs that I initially like: \\"Vertigo\\" to some extent, \\"Crumbs From Your Table,\\" and \\"Love and Peace Or Else.\\" Those songs, I can at least enjoy. It is just that none of these songs seem to hold as much emotion as previous albums. The music seems fine to me. The Edge does some of his cool signature guitar stuff and even changes it up a bit. Larry rocks out with the beat. Adam has some cool bass parts. However, I just feel that the album doesn't represent what U2 is capable of. Bono is known for his ability to lyrically and vocally portray emotion in a moving way, but this album has no examples of that. \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was a good album. It wasn't great like \\"Joshua Tree,\\" \\"War,\\" \\"Pop,\\" and \\"Achtung Baby.\\" Heck, I think most of their albums have moments of greatness, except for \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.\\" If you are really in the mood for U2, I would suggest rediscovering one of their other albums, and don't waste your money on this new one.

B00068IOWC|5.0|Don't hem or haw just buy it. It's the new soundtrack for 2005. Pretty relaxed with lots of surprises. Beautifully written songs and perfectly executed. Personal fav \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" but will probably be a differet one tommorrow. Can't really compare it to any other of their albums, because like the rest they are all different. These guys are so talented and have realy mastered the art of making original music once again!
B0002858YS|5.0|This is an awesome debut album. Sure there are a few weak spots, but don't most debut albums have those? I burned the CD a few weeks ago, but liked it so much I went out and bought it because I like to support good musicians. Here is my track by track: <br /> <br />Jenny was a friend of mine: great song, took me a few tries to figure out what it was about (murdered girlfriend) but awesome nonetheless (9/10) <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside: Awesome song! Flowers really conveys his feelings of jealousy through his singing voice. (10/10) <br /> <br />Somebody told me: THis is the first song I heard from them like most people. Just an all out rocking song, I can listen to it over and over again. (12/10) <br /> <br />All these things that I've done: I hear the beatles in some of these chords, maybe I'm crazy, but its a great slower song, a break from the last two hectic ones! (10/10) <br /> <br />Andy you'r a star: give this song a chance, yes it starts out slow, but the building beat is pretty darn good. (8/10) <br /> <br />On top: cool synthesizer work, but not my favorite tune. not as catchy as the others IMO (6/10) <br /> <br />Change your mind: an all around pretty sound. gives you a warm fuzzy feeling ;)(9.5/10) <br /> <br />Believe me natalie: I can't really get into this song. not a nice melody or anything i can discern (5/10) <br /> <br />Midnight show: cool beat, sort of picks up where jenny was a friend of mine left off. lots of energy (8/10) <br /> <br />Everything will be all right: I love this song! give it a few whirls before you write it off (like I almost did) great drum work (10/10) <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Please my friends, stop marketing for U2, really. Is shameful. <br />With advices like \\"U2 MASTERPIECE\\", \\"IS U2 BEST\\", \\"MUST HAVE, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW TOUR!!!\\" and many other ones it demonstrate the shameful marketing campaign of the people who work for U2. If the album had been excellent would not be necessary to put to tens of people to express words of infinite adoration to this work here, since real fans had been the ones who would have said that. But given that is not the reality, U2 is forced to campaign this shameful way. Horrible. <br />  <br />  <br />
B00005U11Z|5.0|Wonderful DVD of Journey how they are now, new band members, <br />new music. They still rock! This DVD has a bit of everything <br />for the die hard Journey fan yet is a wonderful find for a  <br />true music lover. Steve A. and Deen C. are amazing performers. <br />You have to watch and hear HIGHER PLACE, this song ROCKS! ENJOY!
B00007BHOE|5.0|Every song is a masterpiece. I love every track, even those that i didn't like very much before. I have one problem though, between tracks there are clips of thing that happen before the show and stuff. These get old REALLY fast, but as long as theres a skip button, im alright. The music videos have never been too great, but I LOVE the Spit it out video sooo much so imma let the others slide. Well, in short, SLIPKNOT FANS!! GET THIS NOW!!!!!
B000687M48|3.0|I am a fan of this band, I have been from the beginning. That being said, I'm not going to fawn over this live CD/DVD. Like I mention in my subject heading, it's not bad, but it's also not good. Let me explain. <br /> <br />I judge the worth of a band on both the quality of their music and the quality of their live performances (after all, what's a rock band if they can't tear it up live?). \\"Fallen\\" is both a well-written and well-recorded album. In terms of their live performances (and I have seen them three times), Evanescence isn't all that impressive. They are entertainers more than musicians. While Amy Lee is an incredible singer, and the music her and Ben Moody wrote is compelling and catchy, it doesn't translate very well into a live setting. Anyone who has seen them live knows the band relies heavily on samples, pre-recorded synths, and taped over vocal parts. That being the case, they never perform the songs any different than what they sound like on the album. Some people value that; I suppose I value seeing a band improvise and prove their worth as musicians more than simply performers. All this being considered, their live recording sounds like the album with a less satisfying sound quality. They don't do anything other than perform their music faithfully to its original version, which I find relatively boring. I do give them props on their cover of Korn's \\"Thoughtless,\\" which proves that they do have some live musical creativity up their sleeves.  <br /> <br />So by now I'm sure anyone reading this wants to know what I consider a good live recording, since I just spent a paragraph criticizing Evanescence's. I recently bought Incubus' live CD, \\"Alive at Red Rocks.\\" Now there's a live CD worth owning. Incubus finds the perfect balance between performing their songs as we best know them and altering them to highlight their individual musical talents. It really is a great disc. Another good live disc is Tool's \\"Salival.\\" <br /> <br />I often find that band's release live CD's to pass the time between the end of a tour and the recording of a new album. Evanescence seems to have done just so. Again, the CD/DVD isn't bad, it just isn't good. You'd probably be best off getting this as a present (so you can feel good not having paid for it) or downloading it somehow (if you can live with that ethical dilemma, and considering the fact that these guys are multi-millionaires, it shouldn't be too hard!).  <br /> <br />These are just my two cents. <br /> <br /> <br />I often find

B00000K2VZ|5.0|Janis Joplin's PEARL is a great solo album that makes you wonder if it might have been even better if she had been able to finish all of her vocals before she died. The two best songs are \\"Move Over\\" and \\"Me And Bobby McGee\\", but there's plenty of other good stuff here, too. Get PEARL and CHEAP THRILLS together if possible.
B00068IOWM|4.0|I dig U2 and I like collector's editions (I have lots of cars).  These \\"special\\" editions always cost more and most folks want to know is it worth it.  Well, in this case (as in most) it depends. <br /> <br />This limited collector's edition contains three items--the cd \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" (Hoppy looooves bombs), a studiomentary DVD, and a book.  Obviously the price is higher than just the single cd or that other limited edition thing that includes the cd and dvd only (these potato farmers are marketing geniuses).   <br /> <br />And that's for several reasons:  The cd contains a bonus track not included on either the regular edition or the cd/dvd combo.  It's not listed in the amazon listing above this review (who knows why?) and is a pretty upbeat, punkish number titled \\"Fast Cars\\".  It's pretty good, but a little out of place in spite of the clever lyrics.  The cd itself is probably worth 4.7 stars and the Edge really rocks.  It's a very spirtual cd with some cool words and a lot of nifty base (especially on \\"Love and Peace or Else\\").  So overall the cd is very good--on par with the last release (the one with the song I quote to my fat lazy spouse Bessie just about every other day--\\"Walk On\\") and very reminiscent of the band's earlier style ('October' early).  Again, the guitar is prominent and there's some modern techno keyboardy strange sound stuff on here too.  Very good overall, but the point is there is a bonus track on this set (I believe it's on the Japanese version as well).  As for the DVD... <br /> <br />The accompanying DVD is about 20 minutes long and in spite of what you'll read elsewere, doesn't really contain any complete videos or performances although the primary focus is on \\"Vertigo\\" and the moving \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\".  The commentary (which continually interupts the performances) is interesting and there is conversation about drinking, but nothing about girls in the tour bus or anything scandalous.  Overall, it's a too-short snippet of the band.  And then there's the book... <br /> <br />I like to read, but this isn't really a book I'd look to read.  It's a lot of scribble, some pretty cool sketches and paintings, some Article of Human Rights, lyrics, thoughts on paper and totals about 20 pages.  Depends what you like I suppose.  Personally, I pulled some of the pictures out and taped them to my cubicle at work (just for fun).  You can guess which ones.   <br /> <br />Where this set loses value (aside from the brevity of the dvd) is the package itself.  The book is nicely presented, but the cd and dvd (both) are in slip cases (i.e., prone to getting scratched and annoying to get in and out) and the cd in a pretty flimsy slip case at that.  A besotted listener could easily create some damage.  So be careful.  In summary: Great cd (with a good bonus track), short but interesting dvd, decent book, and lousy package.  I sure hope this was helpful.
B00003CX9S|5.0|Once in a lifetime a movie comes along that is capable of being more than just a movie.  This is such a film.  This movie changed my life.  As a kid I was pushed down the stairs, beat up and made fun of everyday at school.  I used to prey for massive snowstorms so I would get some relief.  Even now when I have the blues I put this movie on.  After viewing, nothing in my life seems so bad.  John Merrick had it bad.  This film shows the cruelity of the world, and shows what a little love and kindness can do.  Beautifuly filmed in glorious black-and-white, it uses camera angles and shadows like no other film I've seen.  David Lynch's direction is both emotional and frightning.  He shows the horrors of the world but not for shock value.  It teaches us all a lesson that even what seems to be monsterous is still human and worth love and affection.  In some twisted way this is a love story.  For love does conquer all... <br /> <br />Not my favorite movie, but in my top ten.  It certainly the best acted and directed movie I have ever seen.  Suprisingly uplifting for such a dark and grim premise.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|in my opinon this is the most diverce cd they have ever made. No matter what how hard you like your music this will have something for you. They really bring it on songs like pulse of the maggots,and duality. but be warned it is defenitly not as hard as iowa.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This collector's edition is awesome!  The book appears to be made of skin and written in blood, and of course the movie itself is great.  By current standards, the special effects are very low budget.  This works well with the quirkiness of the story and the hyper direction.  The camera angles are flashy.  When I first saw this film I knew it would grow to be something special.  A modern tale of madness, zoimbies, and love.  Bruce Campbell became a cult icon and two sequels followed.  A redux is on the way.  Spend the extra money and buy this edition.  It is limited and once they're gone, that's it.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|When I first listened to this cd, I was somewhat disappointed, especially given how much I have liked Ragpicker's Dream.  But I think this music, and particularly the lyrics, take several listens to really appreciate.  This is another really fine work by a great musician.  He has certainly earned our respect over the years with consistently creative and meaningful artistic productions.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Possibly the best character movie since \\"Short Cuts,\\" this film is more off the wall and a whole lot of strange.  The multi stories are all interesting.  My favorite ivolves Tom Cruise.  He was robbed from his oscar.  His performance was so antistereotype of his persona and was so brilliantly acted.  His scenes were breathtaking at times.  John C. Reilly also did a superior job, but these men aren't alone.  All the cast was super and you care about the characters.  At the end of the movie you really get to know them and feel almost that you might have made a friend or two.  Look out for the raining frogs.  That part was simply great.  One of the best movies that was not nominated for best picture.
B0006399FS|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with \\"All You Cant Leave...\\" There were 3 or 4 tracks I really liked on that cd and Beautiful Day is still one of my all time favorites...but several of the tracks on that cd are hookless and forgettable. So I looked forward to this new cd with caution and a bit of skepticism. After listening to it several times...Im MUCH happier with this collection of songs. These songs do a much better job of sucking you in melodically and emotionally. Vertigo is perhaps the weakest track (well...its actually tied with Love and Peace or Else) and it may just be because with all the TV exposure, the song has just grown tiresome and irritating. But, I swear, some of these tracks soar higher than anything they have ever done. \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is a wonderful song that showcases everything that U2 is known for doing well. Great hook...angelic guitars...honest sing along lyrics. Then the track is followed by \\"One Step Closer\\"...probably the best song, next to \\"one\\" that U2 has ever written. It is soulful, sad, and somehow full of joy all at once. It would be a great song to listen to while youre about to blow a fuse in traffic...because it will make you all of a sudden feel really stupid for getting angry...and you may end up with sort of a smile instead. I know...Im being cheesy...but so what. Some writers criticize the band for not being more adventurous on this album. But..if U2 decided to experiment and be risky, these same critics would criticize them for not being themselves...blah blah blah. Some have also complained about Bonos weakening vocals. Yes..he is showing a bit of wear and tear on the vocal cords. A couple of the missed higher notes on the album made me wince and wonder why they havent heard of a \\"do over\\". Its a minor complaint. Bono still sings like he means it. And this fan thanks u2 for another collection of songs that will make my time here on earth just a bit brighter
B0006399FS|5.0|So here's a review I stole from NewsDay which summarizes my thoughts: <br /> <br />Bono called U2's last CD, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" its re-application for the title of \\"world's best rock and roll band.\\" U2's new CD, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" (Interscope), shows that the Irish band not only got the job, but it spent the past few years making sure no one can take that title away. <br /> <br />From start to finish, \\"Dismantle\\" is a winner - and perhaps the first time since \\"The Joshua Tree\\" where The Edge's musical ideas are as strong as Bono's lyrical ones in shaping the band's sound. Perhaps that is due to the unusual recording of the album, in which guitarist The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. worked together on songs without Bono, who needed to complete some work with his humanitarian efforts first. <br /> <br />The first single, \\"Vertigo,\\" is definitely Edge- driven, with its roaring power chords and post-punk snarl. Yes, Bono works in the album's lyrical themes of love and duty, as well as the recurring image of kneeling as a symbol of the benefits you get from giving of yourself. But \\"Vertigo\\" is a rocker first and an artistic statement second. Same goes for \\"All Because of You,\\" which combines the free-wheeling spirit of \\"Boy\\" with The Edge's mastery of the guitar in the 25 years since the recording of that album. <br /> <br />The sprawling \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" brings back the chiming guitar sound of \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" while Bono grapples with the idea of \\"The more you see, the less you know,\\" which pairs well with the idea of \\"Everything I wish I didn't know\\" from \\"Vertigo.\\" We're a long way from the George W. Bush black-and-white world view of \\"I'm wide awake, I'm not sleeping\\" era U2. Unlike politicians, Bono isn't buffaloed by the gray areas; he revels in them. <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is Bono's masterpiece - an emotional, complicated tale about fathers and sons that boils down to the need for that relationship to continue - that The Edge enhances by gorgeous, spare guitarwork. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is much simpler but equally as emotional as it details how the quest is just as valiant as the result. <br /> <br />\\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is yet another sign at how well U2 is doing on its valiant quest to provide great rock music that strives for greatness. It has not achieved perfection yet, but it sure is getting close. <br /> <br />\\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\\" in stores today; Grade: A
B0006B29Z2|5.0|This is a must have.  Period.  A bargain at twice the price.  The Rainbow and Hammersmith shows alone...man.  Just awesome.  Would've loved to have been in that pub when the all the old Maiden-dudes (ex-bandmates) were being interviewed for \\"The Early Days\\" doc.  Brilliant.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I must admit, I haven't read a single Harry Potter book, but I fell in love with the movies.<br /><br />The latest installment to the Harry Potter series was no disappointment.  There were plenty of laughs, excitement, and suspense.  True, the new director has revamped the old Chris Columbus look of Hogwart's, but it serves the movie well.  As the kids grow older, their experiences and emotions are becoming more intense and mature.  The film reflects this.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film was the opening scene involving Harry and his terrible relatives.  This segment was shot with practically no close-ups, which robs the viewer of character reactions.  The scene could have been a hilarious one, but fell flat...simply because we weren't able to determine facial expressions.
0345423496|3.0|Its the year 3001.  A spacecraft has found Frank Poole and he is revived.  After exploring the new world he lives in, Frank encounters the entities that used to be Dave Bowmman and the HAL 9000 computer who have become tools for the mysterious Monolith.  They have disturbing news.  The Monolith sent a message out to its higher headquaters back in 2001 and is now getting a response.  The response does not look good.  Mankind must act quickly or possibly face annhilation.    I was really disappointed with this book.  The story line is excellent, but Clarke squanders what could have been a great ending to an awesome tale.  The first 3/4 of the book is devoted to Frank Poole getting acquainted with mankind in the year 3001.  His discoveries are certainly very interesting and often thought provoking.  But theres a major disconnect.  Just as the pages are getting short, Clarke drops a bombshell on you.  The Monolith might be about to blow up the solar system.  Even more shocking, mankind may be able to stop this!!!    Huh??!!???  Take on the Monolith???  For decades weve looked on the Monolith as being invincible and the author has the  Discovery crew (and a few others) take on the old enigma in a mere 36 pages! While I found these final pages interesting, I feel  Clarke should have spent more time here.    Also, this book has major timing problems.  Theres a minor entry regarding Frank Poole's childhood that would have made him less than 10 years old for the Jupiter mission!  And heres a biggie.  \\"2010\\" has an exerpt showing the year 10,001 AD that hints at the Monolith still guarding Europa.  How can this be???    I found this book dissapointing.  It certainly had some awesome potential, but the inconsistencies are just too much.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I am giving Lucas and his film a half-star more credit than I feel this film deserves. My reasoning? Well, let's see... <br /> <br />First, unlike the original trilogy, the action and spectacle of this movie could not quite outweigh the bad acting. Don't get me wrong: I think Ewan MacGregor did an excellent job in this movie (as he does in just about everything he's in), while Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson (both absolutely wonderful actors in the proper roles) do the best they can with the script they were given. But then there is the wooden acting from our \\"supervillain-to-be\\" (I'm pretty sure the audience was supposed to feel Anakin's earnestness and feeling when he describes his love of podracing, not chuckle), and the ridiculously over-acted roles of the Gungans. I mean, I understand that Lucas was trying to appeal to kids (his own in particular, if I remember correctly), but the Ewoks in \\"Jedi\\" appealed to children and they never said a word of English. Hey, Jar-Jar, what the heck is a \\"boom-de-gasser\\" or a \\"hedlibber\\"??? <br /> <br />Second: On a more positive note, I have to give Lucas credit on this one for Darth Maul. Not only was the climax of \\"The Phantom Menace\\" one of the best fight scenes in the history of cinema, but Maul was one of the better villains to come out of celluloid in a long long while. My only complaint regarding Maul is that the audience is not given any of his history or backstory. It is my earnest opinion that more Maul and less Jar-Jar would have made this a much more Phantom-y and Menace-y experience. <br /> <br />Third: It seems to me that, having seen all the Episodes EXCEPT III, the arc of the \\"Star Wars\\" story mainly concerns Anakin and the price he pays for falling into evil. However, this first Episode more primarily deals with the rise of Palpatine to power, setting up the events of the coming movies. This is not a complaint, necessarily. I just think it would have been better if Lucas could have found a child-actor who hadthe capability of portraying subtle changes in attitude instead of just being exasperated with Yoda and frowning at Mace Windu. I realize he's supposed to still be an innocent, but even so ... Look at the amazing Dakota Fanning --- there are GOOD child-actors out there. Lucas should have found one. (Well, I guess that was kind of a repeat of my first point. Apologies.) <br /> <br />Fourth: The special-effects are excellent in this installment, as is the sound. Of course, with THX involved, just about anything will have a level of excellence in these fields. And THX IS \\"Star Wars\\".  <br /> <br />I wish Lucas would have followed the example that he set for himself and NOT directed all three of the prequels. He directed \\"A New Hope\\", and did a wonderful job for an up-and-coming young director with limited means. But he handed the director's reins over to other people for \\"Empire\\" and \\"Jedi\\" both. And anyone who watches the original trilogy can see the improvements. I'm not criticizing Lucas as a creative mind. I am criticizing him as a film director. As I said, I think he does an admirable job with the skills and relatively limited experience he has had. But let's face it. He hadn't actually directed any film for YEARS when he began working on \\"Phantom\\". And it shows. For pure film spectacle, Lucas is wonderful. But to convey the complexities of the human heart, actors need better direction than \\"Faster, with more intensity.\\" <br /> <br />But, hey ... I'll go see Episode III. Probably on opening night. Lucas has managed to create and sustain a phenomena that means a lot to a lot of people. And he deserves credit for that. Thanks, George!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is my first time buying a Britney album and I'm pleasantly surprised. The r&b and hip hop sounds really good. The great production meshes well with Britney's limited voice. It's obvious she is influenced by Janet Jackson and Madonna. <br /> <br />Some standouts are \\"Me Against the Music\\" \\"Early Mornin'\\" which sounds very non-Mobylike, \\"Outrageous,\\" \\"Everytime\\" \\"Toxic\\" and \\"I Got That,\\" which features the Ying Yang Twins. The other songs still have to grow on me. <br /> <br />Britney is attempting to grow up and mature but it seems she's damned no matter what she does. I notice all of the reviews that attack her personally and judge her personal life rather than showing a bit of class by sticking to the MUSIC. All music is not supposed to sound the same. It's all different slices of the same pie. Britney is NOT supposed to be Bob Dylan. She is her own artist with her own niche and she acts sexy because she's a grown woman who is comfortable with her own sexuality; and there is nothing wrong with that. Why must women be constricted to act like chaste innocents just because some people have problems with women being FREE? <br /> <br />Are some so arrogant that they feel a certain kind of music or  certain artist shouldn't exist just because they don't like it? Musical snobs.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|The title of my review is absolutely true. I'm sure that I probably saw some Disney movie or something before I saw the \\"Star Wars\\" movies, but these are the movies that I actually remember seeing first, if only because of the impact they had on my imagination. That's what \\"Star Wars\\" is all about, after all. They are modern myths, told by one of the most imaginative storytellers of this century.  <br /> <br />These movies appeal to children on several different levels. First of all, the creatures and settings are fantastical (the best examples of \\"science fiction\\" we have). They are fun, with an action-packed storyline and memorable characters. And the imagery of \\"good vs. evil\\" has rarely been better shown.  <br /> <br />But then they also appeal to adults. Why is that? Because they are myth, they resonate with our minds and hearts no matter what age we are. The conflict of good vs. evil is not the only imagery we, as adults, can identify with. There are political storylines, and we are shown the eternal lesson of how power can corrupt. There are themes of redemption, family conflict and resolution, and the power of strong friendship. The roles of student and mentor are also examined from positive and negative angles.  <br /> <br />These movies never fail to entertain me, even after having seen them literally dozens of times. I grew up watching them on VHS, and now that they are on DVD, the picture and sound quality is absolutely amazing. The \\"older\\" movies look just as sharp as the \\"new\\" trilogy. <br /> <br />What I cannot understand are some of the fans of this series. Not necessarily just \\"Star Wars\\", either, but Trekkies as well. Both \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" have explored ancient themes in the context of futuristic settings, and done that task exceptionally well. But those people who insist on going to the conventions and dressing like their favorite characters boggle my mind. These movies are ENTERTAINMENT, nothing more. Stop taking them so seriously. Stop living your life based on science fiction. And for goodness' sake, stop posting \\"reviews\\" of Episode III when the thing hasn't even come out yet. If you'd like to discuss rumors and trailers and spoilers, go to the websites devoted to such things. Please put REVIEWS on the review site.  <br /> <br />That's just a personal complaint. Moving on . . . <br /> <br />For a classic storyline in cinema and in the area of SF, it is nigh impossible to beat this trilogy. I have more to say about the prequels, posted in the proper place.
B0006399FS|5.0|Simply put- this is one awesome CD.  <br />The album kicks off with \\"Vertigo\\" (the song that you've heard on the heavily-run Ipod commercial). This is a great rocker, though it takes a few listens. It sounds alot better on CD.  <br />\\"Miracle Drug\\", the next song, is definately an album highlight. It's spot on the album is perfect.  <br />\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a cross between \\"Stuck In A Moment\\" and \\"Walk On\\", and it's delivered here with lots of emotion. Yet another highlight in a string of them.  <br />\\"Love and Peace Or Else\\" is a really heavy song that's easy to get pumped to.  <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\".... you'll have to hear it to believe it.  <br />\\"All Because of You\\" (the next single from the album) is very similar to \\"Vertigo\\" in some ways. Very nice with great lyrics. <br />It's at this point in the album where it begins to slow down and enter sort of a new phase.  <br />\\"A Man and A Woman\\" kicks it off, a good little love song with an excellent bassline that sucks you right in.  <br />\\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is also very good. The vocals on the verse sound excellent.  <br />\\"One Step Closer\\" is very atmospheric, kinda like \\"4th of July\\" except with lyrics. It's my least favorite on the album, but it's not bad at all.  <br />\\"Original of the Species\\" has more hooks than any other song on the album, but seems flat at some parts. Still great though.  <br />I don't know why \\"Yahweh\\" doesn't get any attention, because it's a really great song and a great end to a great album.  <br />I recommend this CD to everybody. It also goes great with Thanksgiving. (Don't ask why)
B0000062GK|5.0|Thanks for reading my review. I love all of Joes album. This would have to be my all time favourite Satriani album along with \\" The Extremist\\" Not to mention one of my all time favourite albums.... period. Whatever Joe was on while he made this one.. I WANT IT! <br />There is not a bad song on here, in fact there is not even a mediocre song on here, they are all brilliant! <br />This is hard rocking, guitar smoking, mind bending, finger blistering playing from the guitar genius. <br />Highlights for me are \\" Crystal Planet\\" What can I say- One of my all time favourite songs- worth buying the CD just for this. Goose bump material! Awesome bass and drumming too. Guitar work is undescribable it is that good. <br />\\" Love thing\\" One of Joes more slower ballads along the lines of \\"Rubina\\", \\" Cryin\\" or \\" The crush of love\\" <br />Great wah wah pedal work , with beautiful evocative work. <br />\\" Lights of Heaven\\" How does Joe make a mellow song still sound mellow, while he plays screaming notes over it? Just listen to this and you'll get the answer. <br />\\" Rasberry Jam Delta\\" Love the name, love the melody, Love the pedals he using. Brilliant! <br />\\" Ceremony\\" more creative work here. Alternates between some fast and slow work. <br />\\" With Jupiter in Mind\\"  <br />Joes loves the space theme doesn't he? <br />My wife thinks that Joe is an alien. He has a shaved head now, because really his hair is bright red, and he got sick of dying it to fit in with humans. He also has bright glowing green eyes- hence the sunglasses- he got sick of wearing contacts you see. <br />No honest... I mean his first album was \\" Not of this Earth \\" Big clue there hey? <br />Later came \\" Surfin' with the alien\\" <br />This album is called \\" Crystal Planet\\" ( his home planet maybe? )  His last one is called \\" Is there love in Space?\\" ( Is he getting lonely? ) <br />Seriously, \\" With Jupiter in mind\\" is another one of those tracks where Joe plays a slightly off note within the key to give it it's distinctive sound. Just pure excellence. <br />\\" A piece of Liquid \\" is another brilliant mellow song, with an unusual melody. Nice laid back song. <br />\\"Time\\" another all time favourite. Words escape me, this song is SO good, I wish I had the words to describe it. Absolutely brilliant. Brilliant drumming. Brilliant bass. Brilliant melody. Slow and fast, different pedals used. Stunning song. <br />\\"ZZS\\" song, lovely song written for his kid. Sounds like a bedtime melody it's so relaxing. What a beautiful song. <br />Just BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY PLEASE IF YOU DON\\"T OWN IT YET! YOUR EARS WILL LOVE YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!! <br />If you only own one guitar album, but this one, it is superb! <br />Enjoy it! <br />Thanks for reading <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|That seems to be the big thing with u2 these days.  It's funny to see people criticize their \\"POP\\" album because this is what got me into the group.  I was too young for \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa.\\"  But with u2 I've noticed, even die-hard fans will hate this album.  Because of their experimentation over the years, people like certain u2 sounds.  So some u2 fans won't like this record, then there are those that just hate u2, and then there are those fans and others that just love the new album.  And you know what, I love that.  It's cool when everyone debates over music, and u2 love it because even if you don't like them, you're still talking about them.  I think this new CD is fantastic.   <br />Favorites (hate to call them that, I've only had the CD for one day): Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, and A Man and a Woman.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2's How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is yet another brilliant collection by the great Irish band.  Despite the fact they have been recording albums for almost twenty-five years, the band still sounds fresh and vital.  Very few artists (Bruce Springsteen is another notable exception) in music history have been able to come up with such outstanding work this far into their careers.  After the poor attempt at electronica on 1997's Pop, the band got back to their roots on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind.  Bomb is an extension and improvement on that fine album.  The album has the ethereal feel of their mid 80's work and Bono offers some very strong lyrics.  Songs effortless bounce between driving rock and moving ballads.  \\"All Because Of You\\" has a sledgehammer riff, but the lyrics are a moving tribute by Bono to his late father.  \\"Vertigo\\" is the first single and while it is one of the lesser tracks on the album it starts it off with some glam rock fun.  \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" has a sound that harkens back to the Boy-October days and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" has a seductive soul styling.  \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" is a love letter to New York City and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is a pensive look at love.  The best song on the album is gorgeous \\"Original Of The Species\\" and the album close with the prayer-like \\"Yahweh\\".  The band is in tight form throughout with The Edge supplying his trademark riffs and Adam Clayton & Larry Mullen laying down a solid and sturdy rhythm section.  Bono does his best vocal work in years.  U2 is sometimes too earnest for their own good, but their earnestness works to a great advantage on this album.  How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is one of the best albums of this year and of this young century.
B00005JNDX|5.0|Bridget Jones is back. Once again she struggles with her weight and love confusion. She has a boyfriend, charming Mark Darcy, yet she feels unsure of this relationship. She is convinced that this spark between her and Darcy is gone. And then comes along Daniel Cleaver. In a steamy and exotic scenery of Thailand Bridget is hoping to begin a new without-Mark-Darcy life, however, what she really begins is a cornucopia of slip-ups. And once again she deals with it in a typical, yet delightful Bridget-like way. <br />In this movie as in the previous one we meet again Renee Zelweger (Bridget Jones), Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver). But this time more of Bridget's friends show up and it's good to see that the movie is not entirely Bridget oriented. <br />The movie may not be the one hundred percent adequate reflection of the book, yet it contains this light-hearted humour which was used by Fielding to describe Bridget's search for love. <br />So, if you are looking for an amuzing yet not silly movie, for a bit of emotion and a loads of fun and all this spiced up with a portion of romance, go and see it. So what if Mark Darcy guy is a hard to find and real life Bridgets mostly end up dreaming of a perfect man. They won't find him at home. This movie at least will show them and all of us that the search for the real love is sometimes bumpy and often knackering yet worth taking the risk, because one never knows when it hits him. You, however, will not have to risk with the movie - fun is guaranteed. You will enjoy it!
B0002MRPE0|2.0|Thing is, anyone who listens to Cocker's voice for the first time will more than likely be intimidated by his high octane \\"white soul\\" delivery. Question is how long does the trick keep up? How long can you simply be satisfied merely by his voice? <br /> <br />    Cocker has been employing the same tactic for quite some years now. Do a few covers, pen in a couple of usually forgettable songs and voila, there ya have it. This time around he thinks \\"hey, why not go the whole 9 yards and do a whole album of covers\\"? Which is exactly what he proceeded to do. <br /> <br />    Most of the songs he chose are given a rather unremarkable makeover even though Joe's voice at the tender age of 60 continues to be noticeable. Classic case of a good try that gets no cigar. I wont go the length of actually mentioning which tunes he's covering here even if some of his choices are actually intriguing because the point remains that this a bland, boring and driveless affair.  <br /> <br />   Still, and possibly quite surprisingly Cocker continues to actually muster good sales and have a dedicated fan base. But hey, i never claimed i understood everything going on in the music world or in this world in general. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Hallelujah. I've loved this band since I first heard them in 1981. They sound great.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Darren Aronofsky has done it again.  He has made an incredible film, based on an amazing book.  Once again, his intuition and creative genius has made a thought-provoking film.  This is another film where you cannot just see it once and grasp how intricate it actually is.  His filmmaking techniques are amazing and anyone who ever wants to enter the independent film industry should literally study his work.  Many may claim that it is a druggy movie due to the repetition of the drug scenes, but they don't understand his \\"hip-hop montage\\".  I will say it over and over again this is not a druggy movie, it is a movie that will break through barriers and look deep into addiction in all facets of life.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This film is entertaining and hilarious.  But it is also something more...   <br /> <br />It is able to create a timeless era where sideways ponytails and lanyards are as normal as access to internet chat rooms.  The seemingly impossible connection between cultural nuances from the past with contemporary idiosyncracies is marvelous. <br /> <br />Also...  when was the last time you saw a PG-rated comedy that had no profanity, no obscene sexual references, and no sex/intimate scenes that was hilarious and NOT a children's film?  Probably not recently. <br /> <br />Characters in this film are made memorable through an excellent script and even better acting.  \\"Star power\\" didn't make each character memorable.  I can't think of any leading men or ladies in Hollywood could have done a better job developing these characters on screen. <br /> <br />This film has multi-faceted attributes that make it a representation of cinematic genious.
078401213X|5.0|Pi is the kind of independent film that both encourages aspiring filmmakers and discourages them.  It encourages them, because they can see that it is possible to make an incredible movie and break into the film industry with 60 grand.(It costs even less to shoot in color)  However, it discourages them, because the intuition and creative genius that Darren Aronofsky makes you feel like you're trying to take 1+1 while Albert Einstein is doing the Relativity Theory.  Most people will not like this movie, because they don't understand film, yet.  Watch it once or twice.  Read about the background info online, then watch it with the commentary.  Then, watch it again.  You will be amazed at how incredible this movie really is.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The strong message i got from this film is that the four main characters in the movie are no different than you or I. We are all addicted to something.  That something is the fix that acts a \\"crutch\\" or a \\"reason for getting out of bed in the morning\\" as Sara Goldfarb put it.  Whether its coffee, alcohol, nicotine, sex or heroin we are all addicted and have our own addictive daily routines that we follow.  It made me really look at my own life and my own addictions which luckly arn't the same as the vices depicted in the film.   <br /> <br />I certainly wouldn't describe this film as a cautionary tale.  Some people have reviewed this film as if it something kids should be forced to watch to scare them from ever taking drugs in the future.  It couldn't be further away from that, it shows the highs and the lows of drug abuse and how even though a drug may be legal it can have the same if not more damaging effects that some of the most talked about illegal drugs. <br /> <br />If your a serious film fan you must watch this film, watch it on your own and have a serious think about what the movie mean't to you.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Every now and then a movie like A Beatiful Mind will come out that saves Hollywood and leaves me with just enough respect to keep searching it's black hole of petty movies.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is definitely one of the movies.  As an Independent Filmmaker, I have a great deal of respect for the director and writer of this film.  The screenplay is one of the greatest/most creative screenplays I have read in a long time.  The director expands on that with a creative spin that makes you yearn for understanding.  The actors forget about hollywood and are actually engrossed in their characters and make you feel like you are a part of their lives.
B0006399FS|1.0|I really wanted to like this album, but in the end i was just very disapointed.  I have no desire to bash U2.  They are the band that made me love rock music.  War is the first cd I ever bought, and it one of my all time favorite cds, along with The Joshua Tree and Actung Baby.  But How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sounds like it was made by artists who forgot how to make music.  There is no anger in this new album, no stand out guitar parts, or even heartfelt passionate sreams from Bono.  It is all very soft but it lacks beauty at the same time.  Bono's lyrics never match the tempo of the music (except in the catchy and only decent track, \\"Vertigo\\") and they end up being simply unweildy and misplaced and boring.  Alanis Morrisette can get away with unweildy lyrics, they actually add to her music, but it just doesn't work for U2.  Furthermore, basic things that you would expect from any good rock band, not to mention U2, simply never happen.  There songs never go anywhere.  There is no build up to any grand climax in any of the songs.  At first you may think a song has potential but then it continues for four minutes and dies without ever leaving the ground. <br />And of course U2 doesn't have to be angry to be good.  They used to write truly beautiful songs, like \\"Bad,\\" \\"With or Without you,\\" \\"Running to Stand Still\\" or \\"Trying to Throw Your Arms around the world.\\"  These new songs seem like they want to be pretty (at least they are all pretty slow in tempo and have relatively soft singing), but somehow the heartfelt beauty and sadness in songs like \\"With or Without You\\" or \\"Trying to Throw Your Arms around the World,\\" the loss and pain in songs like \\"Bad\\" or \\"Running To Stand Still,\\" and all of the genuine emotion seems to be missing and without it the songs all seem dead and boring.  There is no track that can stand out and deliver the beauty and emotion that you might expect.  \\"Vertigo\\" is a fun and catchy song that actually sounds like Rock, but the rest of thealbum is dismal at best.  I am tempted to go ahead and give them two stars because at least it is U2, but the album is so bad that I can't justify it.
B000002UAU|4.0|like what chuck said this cd is not the best cd ever. First of all it isn't even the best BEATLE cd ever(revolver)which did not influence people more but was still better and more innovative. however just because most of their talent was in writing easy yet incredinbly catchy tunes that does not make them any less \\"good\\".I have to say that i didn't know it was posible for 4 people to make a song with a FIVE MINUTE fade out(hey jude). Paul also was a VERY good bass and george (i am too lazy to type their last names)was also a good(still very good compared to john) guitar player(john and ringo just sucked...)anyway if you really want the best cd i suggest you read on this site about these cds...in this order)buy this cd since it is still a great one to hear <br />1.1. Revolver (1966)-The Beatles <br />  2. Pet Sounds (1966)-Beach Boys <br />  3. Dark Side Of The Moon (1973)-Pink Floyd <br />  4. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)-The Beatles <br />  5.

B000002UAU|3.0|Let me, right off the bat, disown any claim to originality:<br /><br />\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is neither the greatest album ever made nor the greatest Beatles album ever made. I am completely convinced that this is true. But I will go a step further: it is not even *one of* the greatest albums ever made, nor *one of* the greatest Beatles albums ever made. When I think of all of the records that fall into either category, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" does not jump out at me as one that I would like to go listen to. In terms of the listening pleasure that I derive from the record, it is almost completely inconsequential to me.<br /><br />SP has its good and really bad moments. Note that I did not say *really* good and really bad moments. The best moment for both Paul and John is their one collaboration, \\"A Day in the Life\\". In terms of their individual songs, three of Paul's contributions nearly sink the entire record. John's songs might be better than Paul's while they are playing, but are pretty much completely forgettable to me otherwise. Ringo's turn at the mike is generally harmless and a bit amusing, but my man George delivers a pretty decent performance with his one contribution. All and all, there are 3 or 4 songs that I don't mind sitting through. (Perhaps it was wise for The Beatles to pose as a different band for this record.)<br /><br />What all this means is that SP is lacking the basic, most essential element of a great album: a batch of great songs. Innovation and influence are certainly major contributors to an album's greatness, but they do not - individually or in combination - equal greatness. Without at least a majority of equally great songs, an album cannot be considered wholly great. Songs that sound great sonically are not necessarily great songs lyrically and musically. Having said that, let us consider the songs on SP.<br /><br />(But first, there are those who argue that \\"Pet Sounds\\" - there I go again - is a more impressive technical achievement. Since that album was released a year before SP, they also argue that it deserves more or at least equal praise. This is all very fair, but SP was a much larger seller, so its influence was more widespread. So can we all agree that SP is sonically brilliant and hugely influential - even if it had less recognized peers - and on those grounds it is an indispensably important achievement? Good.)<br /><br />The aforementioned good moments are, alas, few and far between. I would say that the top tier of songs is made up of \\"Fixing A Hole,\\" \\"Within You Without You,\\" and the brilliant \\"A Day in the Life.\\" Paul's voice sounds great on \\"Fixing A Hole,\\" but maybe the fact that it is better than his other songs on SP is just a welcome relief. \\"Within You Without You\\" gives us George's under appreciated voice, and his trademark Eastern instrumentation and philosophical lyrics. And \\"A Day in the Life\\" speaks for itself, but I will interrupt it briefly. Paul and John's voices are in fine form, the slow acoustic guitars draw you in with curiosity, the orchestral swells build tension, and the \\"ba - baba - ba ba\\" riff before the final verse brings the song back down to earth. This is the album's one true saving grace.<br /><br />However, it cannot quite redeem the entire album, going to show that perhaps not all that ends well is well. First of all, since it is the last song on the disc, the listener is forced to wait around for it, probably overrating the other songs as they yearn for the greatness that they have been promised is on the record. Second, it appears after the \\"Reprise,\\" which gives a tacked-on feel to a song that already seems like it isn't an integral part of the album. Finally, the fact that it is SO much better than every other song on the album makes the other songs seem even paler by comparison.<br /><br />So far, not so good. Now, let me take a deep breath and discuss Paul's misfires and flat-out stinkers. \\"Getting Better\\" should be a feel-good song, perhaps the one most in the spirit of the album's overall optimism. But Paul's lyrics - assuming that they are meant to be listened to and not merely heard - muddy the waters. As he sings \\"it's getting better all the time,\\" John sings \\"it can't get much worse\\" in the background. So what are we to believe? Are things getting better because things are good and on an upward trajectory, or are things so bad that anything different at all is an improvement? And if the former is the case, as I think that we are supposed to assume it is, why express the latter sentiment at all? Finally, how is one supposed to take the lyrics, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman/I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved/Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene\\"? Oh good, so you're no longer a wife beater. Your old woman, wherever she is, must be thrilled, and your new one must be relieved that she was able to change you enough so that you don't beat her. It really does everyone involved a whole lot of good.<br /><br />\\"She's Leaving Home\\" is not really that bad of a song, but for an album mostly full of cheer and whimsy, it is a real downer. It makes no contribution to the theme or musical unity of the record. It sounds completely out of place. Had it been placed on an album without any arguable pretense of thematic unity (buried on The White Album, perhaps), it might have packed more of a punch. It is a really good song on the wrong album.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Lovely Rita\\" is just annoying and confusing. (What was up with Paul's attitude toward women on this record?!) He thinks she is lovely, and is clearly smitten with her, but he says that when he experienced his love at first sight, he thought that she looked like an older military man. Now, to each his own, Paul, but I sure hope that you didn't tell her that. Then, when he does go out with her, she says he wants to see her again, but doesn't get the check at dinner. At long last, as if he hasn't sunk low enough, he is disappointed by his failure to score a m&eacute;nage-a-trois with her sisters. OY! (Remember, lyrics are meant to be listened to, not just heard.)<br /><br />Now, what about John's songs? Well, I don't really find them to be good enough or bad enough to merit extended discussion. They are, like Paul's songs, certainly not among his best or even better Beatles songs. Which forces me to ask, how can this be the best album either of all time or of The Beatles' career if the two main songwriters do not turn in some of their even *better* songs? Search me.<br /><br />Basically then, I do not get a lot of pleasure from listening to this record, and I am not sure why I should. It is pleasant enough in spots, but while The Beatles claim to have arrived at maturity with this record, they come across sounding more middle-aged. I cannot and will not deny that this album has \\"greatness\\" to it -- it is innovative, influential, and considered by many who take such a question very seriously to be the greatest album of all time. It is essential listenting for these reasons alone. But in my opinion, not enough of the greatness is the result of the songs themselves. Moreover, the other elements of greatness are not enough to keep me from wanting to listen to any number of other CDs, either by The Beatles themselves or any other artist. (Love's \\"Forever Changes\\", the psychedelic flipside of SP, comes to mind.) Therefore, I can recommend SP mainly for its importance as a major document in the history of popular music. Like that book that you have to read for your English class, hear this CD because you have to. You will most likely appreciate it, and may even enjoy it. But also like that English book, you shouldn't feel obligated to like it. And if you don't, finish it up and move on to something else.
