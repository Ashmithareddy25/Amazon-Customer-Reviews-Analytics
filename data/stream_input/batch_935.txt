B000002LMM|5.0|...or was it a bass guitar? Either way, the opening riff to Twin Peaks ranks among the most iconic few notes ever recoded, easily equal to Black Sabbath's, \\"Black Sabbath\\", the Rolling Stones, \\"Start Me Up,\\" and Jimi Hendrix's, \\"Purple Haze\\", and White Stripes, \\"Seven Nation Army.\\" 4 notes that evoked an entire alternate universe filled with killings, odd characters, possession, the FBI, hot high school girls, drugs, incest and the super-natural.  If you liked Twin Peaks, these tracks will haunt you and pull you back into the world of Laura Palmer, Agent Cooper, the Log Lady, BOB, Major Briggs, The Man from Another Place and the Giant.  Get this album, put it on, it'll creep you out, and take you back.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|If it wasn't for Star Trek I wouldn't have met my late husband.  We met in a Star Trek chat room on AOL, fell in love and the rest is history (we were together for 13 years).<br /><br />From the moment he heard there was a new Star Trek movie coming out with the original characters, he was like a kid in a candy store.  Every week he would ask when is it coming and every day he was surfing the internet looking for news.<br /><br />Sad to say he didn't live to see what he so anxiously waited for.  When the movie opened at our theater I took off work early to catch it on IMAX.  I even wore his favorite Star Trek shirt with the saying, \\"If you're wearing a red shirt, RUN!!!!\\".  I cried through most of the movie (thinking about hubby). The movie was fantastic and JJ did a great job of portraying the characters and the actors fit their parts well.  Chris Pine plays Kirk as if he was born to the role, and Zachary Quinto was awesome as the younger Spock. The rest of the cast was excellent as well and Scotty was too funny for words.  I thought it was brilliant that the character of Sulu got to use his fencing abilities, because we didn't really get to see much in the original series.  Seeing Leonard Nimoy as the older Spock made it even better, since he is my favorite character.<br /><br />However, there is one thing that my husband would not have liked and that was a certain relationship between two of the main characters.  But I thought it was interesting and well played.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, I won't spoil anything, but if you are a true Star Trek fan or even if you aren't this will be a great addition to your home movie library.<br /><br />Enjoy and have a great time.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|So,this is Clint Eastwood's last movie as an actor.He did a very good job in closing out a wonderful career.The movie made me angry about the street gang he takes on and it shows how our youth today are destroying their lives.His character is one person who is not afraid to back down from a threat.I did see some Dirty Harry in the movie.The trailer to the movie was great.Although this is his last movie as an actor and now he is going behind the camera I will always be a Clint Eastwood fan.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Just like all the other reviews have stated, this is a awesome live DVD/CD. I would say it's one of the best live music DVD's I've seen. The camera work adds a lot to the performance and doesn't detract from it at all.    One of the main things I like about the DVD is that it focuses equally on all the members which is great for me because I get to see great footage of Ronnie Vannucci who's not only an amazing drummer, but has great showmanship too.    If you are a Killers fan you shouldn't hesitate at all in getting this awesome DVD and CD package.

B0013FFMOK|2.0|Let me state right from the beginning that if I had not read the book, I may have ranked the movie higher, but (unfortunately) I can't be that objective. Richard Matheson's near perfect man vs. self story of isolation and terror had been made into too many bad film versions already, and this one does nothing to help the cause. Will Smith does a nice job of trying to carry the film on his well developed shoulders (nice job with the reverse chin-ups, Fresh Prince) but the plot is convoluted and the emotion is forced. Watch this, if you must, but be prepared to be hugely disappointed if you've read and enjoyed the novel.
0385341008|5.0|United by love for literature, author Juliet Ashton and a quirky band of Guernsey Islanders embark upon mutual enchantment. The story, told through letters to each other, unfolds when their WWII memories are fresh and touching stories abound. Just as Juliet's professional goal during the war was to write humorous commentary to help lighten the oppression, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society novel's daily funny surprises relieve the modern reader's sadness on learning of the war's cruelties and hardships.<br /><br />You have to love a columnist whose comments on the Prince Albert statue in Kensington Gardens include praise for the planting of peas on the grounds, since \\"no better scarecrow than Prince Albert existed in all of England.\\" And you have to love a book club that encourages candor such as \\"Marcus Aurelius was an old woman.\\" Through the book club, one member discovered a poet, Wilfred Owen, who really spoke to his heart; he was upset that The Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892-1935 excluded Owen's poetry. When he investigated, he learned that \\"they let a man named Yeats choose the poems, but they shouldn't have. Who is he, and what does he know about verse?\\"<br /><br />Characters include a woman who reads the bumps on people's heads, a claustrophobic parrot, unscrupulous competitors, octogenarian twins who throw darts at a portrait of the Duchess of Windsor, and a wine-tippling man sustained during troubles by Seneca's relevance. These simple Guernsey farmers found solace and enlightenment in books during a dark period in their island's history. Some had read hardly anything but gardening books before discovering Charles Lamb, Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters, and Shakespeare, among other classic writers. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is perfectly crafted to broaden today's readers' literary horizons as well.<br /><br />This novel paints a profound, poignant portrait of human nature with a light touch. Despite grim details of German bomb destruction and occupation poverty, every page depicts true friendship, heroic courage, and rich, simple pleasures. I've read this delightful book twice recently; I could easily read it again.uction and occupation poverty, every page depicts true friendship, heroic courage, and rich, simple pleasures.

Now that I've listened to it probably between 200 and 300 times, it is undoubtedly my favorite in the LZ canon.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that over the decades it has received the least airplay, but I think it goes deeper.  Don't miss this one, it's a gem.

BUT, this Amazon exclusive box set is a rip-off.    Combined CD/DVD of Nirvana Live at Reading costs $25. This Amazon box(with the same CD/DVD set)is $36. For the extra $11, you get a flimsy box with \\"Nirvana\\" stamped on the side, and a small poster. If that's worth $10-12 more to you, go for it. But you could get an entire other CD plaus the Nirvana CD/DVD for the same $36.    Just not worth it, Amazon; try harder next time...
1591842972|5.0|Note: The review that follows is of the Expanded Edition.<br /><br />In my review of an earlier edition, I observed that, paradoxically, Steve Jobs continues to be one of the best known and yet least understood CEOs in recent business history. It is probably true that most of those who once worked or who now work at Apple Computer will learn more about Jobs as they read Leander Kahney's book and the subsequent Expanded Edition than they knew previously. For years, they and others shared the opinions expressed in this brief excerpt from the Introduction:<br /><br />\\"Jobs is a control extraordinaire. He's also a perfectionist, an elitist, and a taskmaster to employees. By most accounts, Jobs is a borderline loony. He is portrayed as a basket case who fires people in elevators, manipulates partners, and takes credit for others' achievements. [Alan Deutschman, The Second Coming of Steve Jobs, Pages 59, 197, 239, 243, 254, 294-95 and Jeffrey S. Young, icon: Steve Jobs, The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business, Pages 212, 213, and 254]. Recent biographies paint an unflattering portrait of a sociopath motivated by the basest desires - to control, to abuse, to dominate. Most books about Jobs are depressing reads. They're dismissive, little more than catalogs of tantrums and abuse. No wonder he's called them `hatchet jobs.' Where's the genius?\\" All or at least some of this is may be true and yet....<br /><br />He is a \\"control freak\\" and yet \\"throughout his career, Jobs has struck up a long string of productive partnerships - both personal and corporate. Jobs's success has depended on attracting great people to do great work for him. He's always chosen great collaborators [as well as] \\"forged (mostly) harmonious relationships with some of the world's top brands - Disney, Pepsi, and the big record labels.\\" Kahney also points out that \\"through judicious use of both the carrot and the stick, Jobs has managed to retain and motivate lots of top-shelf talent...and then given them the freedom to be creative and shielded them from the growing bureaucracy at Apple.\\" As Jobs sees it, \\"My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.\\"<br /><br />In this Expanded Edition, Kahney provides a new chapter devoted entirely to issues concerning Jobs's battle with pancreatic cancer. In a rare memo to the entire company, on August 1, 2004, he offered a number if reassurances, notably that the neuroendocrine or islet-cell tumor is curable by surgery if diagnosed in time, that the operation had already occurred, and that there was no need for follow-up radiation or chemotherapy treatments. All seemed to go well for the next two years and then, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, Jobs appeared frail, indeed \\"emaciated\\" despite claims to the contrary by Apple spokespersons that his health was \\"robust.\\" Only much later did he admit that his health-related issues were much more serious than previously indicated. What Kahney has to say about subsequent developments is best revealed within the narrative, in context, such as the increasingly more important role that Apple's COO, Tim Cook, has in the company, although Jobs continued as CEO.<br /><br />During his research for the first edition of this book, Kahney was struck by Jobs's apparent preoccupation with death, indicated by how many times he mentioned it as the driving force in his life. In a commencement speech to the graduating class at Stanford in 2005, he observed, \\"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\\" This perspective helps to explain why Jobs has always been so impatient, so demanding, and so contemptuous of anything and anyone that is not \\"insanely great.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, the Apple culture has been an extension of Jobs's personality and style. To me, his brain resembles a minefield, a lush garden filled with beautiful flowers and plants, a fireworks display, a demolition derby, a six-year old's birthday party, a torture chamber, a vast green meadow, a shooting gallery, and a state fair. When he was in good health and centrally involved, it was never dull. With Jobs, nothing ever is. Although there is other new material in this book, Chapter 9 (what is now the concluding chapter) will probably be of greatest interest to those who ask, \\"What will happen to Apple after Steve Jobs is no longer involved?\\" No matter what happens, it does seem certain that an Apple without him will be different and perhaps he would be disappointed if it weren't.owers and plants, a fireworks display, a demolition derby, a six-year old's birthday party, a torture chamber, a vast green meadow, a shooting gallery, and a state fair.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|We saw the film last weekend and haven't been able to stop talking about it. MJ was an incredible talent-it's too bad we had to wait till after his death to see him like this. I can't wait to buy the DVD so I can watch this film over and over - wow.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I just got my copy yesterday and watched it last night. Everyone needs to watch this dvd. It is a great review of what has happened to our food supply and our treatment of the animals and farmers who used to be the backbone of the country. This dvd is an education we all need to have.  Thank goodness I grew up on a farm/ranch where the animals were all treated humanly, fed what they were meant to eat and prepared for food with care and cleanness and no one ever got ecoli. Our animals were all well fed with the things God intended them to eat and kept in clean open spaces. Our hens sang as they laid their eggs and as they went about their day.  I was sick as I saw what people who only care about money have done to us. They make me want to be a vegetarian or at least go totally organic or buy from a local farmer where I can see the conditions they are kept under.  My husband worked for a rancher who kept a pig confinement.   After he would go in and tend the pigs there was no way you could be around him because of the stink even after a shower and change of clothes. We got a different job as soon as we could find one. The pigs however spent their whole lives in that stink.  My nephew worked at a feedlot for cattle in Nebraska. When he would come in the house for supper even after a change of clothes and a shower you could not sit by him and eat supper because of the stink. The cows however were in that until the day they went to slaughter, up to their knees.  In this dvd I saw how the chicken confinement sheds are too. What a disgrace and a crime against God's creatures.   THen at the last to show how Monsanto has sued and broken the farmers who tried to keep our food supply clean and our corn and soybeans safe to eat.   In what we think is the greatest country in the world the corruption and graft is inexcusable. We have allowed the big companies to poison us and our children and put God's creatures though untold suffering.  You must see this dvd if you care about your self, your family and the helpless creatures they torture to death.  God bless Eric Schlosser and the people who made this dvd to make us aware of what is happening.

B001AR0D4A|5.0|I loved this movie and i can't see why most people don't like it,it wasn't no Dark Knight,but it had its own style,Yes the acting could be better but who cares,all i want is a good story and that's what we got.I know alot of the folks on here may have left the same reviews on Youtube, but you will still get the latter like me who loved this movie for being its own.The ending left me shocked and had me thinking like damn atleast you knew the military was kicking ass because hey it was their screw-up and they had to fix it.Wish he would had waited a few before he killed everyone tho.That's what happens when you believe its the end of the world and you wouldn't the one you care about to be food for those creatures.Realistic ending indeed i would surely had done the same.But why didn't he just jump in front of one of the tanks when he knew he screwed up big time huh lol.So to all the haters out there who wants a movie to be epic like DarkKnight was this wasnt that type of movie just watch the movie for what it was,a Horror Picture.

B002Q4TKAY|5.0|This is a majestic performance from beginning to end, and The Killers prove themselves well-worthy of the beautiful Royal Albert Hall setting.    I saw the band live at T in the Park earlier in the year, and while some elements of the performance are similar (the set list is almost identical, and some of the songs are introduced in the same way), the overall \\"feel\\" of the Royal Albert Hall gig is more refined and intimate.     Highlights, for me, are the extended Day and Age Tour versions of \\"For Reasons Unknown\\" and \\"Bling\\" (both of which drop down and take a lull while Brandon Flowers encourages some crowd interaction, before picking back up and exploding into their utterly climactic conclusions); the surprise-packages of \\"I Can't Stay\\" and \\"Sweet Talk\\" (the former in particular is performed stunningly), and the one-two smackdown of \\"Mr Brightside\\" and \\"All These Things That I've Done\\"... \\"Spaceman\\" and \\"Dustland Fairytale\\" are a pretty powerful combination too. Generally speaking, all of the tracks sound far better live than they do recorded; there's more energy and clarity to them and Flowers' voice sounds tremendous when it isn't needlessly roboticized as it sometimes is in their albums.    The only song that I feel somewhat drags is \\"The World We Live In\\", but that's more to do with the fact that the studio version was never a favourite of mine anyway, not because it's a sub-par performance -- if you like the song, you'll like the live version more than I did.    The DVD begins and ends with new versions of \\"Enterlude\\" and \\"Exitlude\\", and features bonus performances, including one of my personal favourites \\"Tranquilize\\" from the Oxegen festival. In terms of bonus features it's a bit sparse; there's a nice little Behind The Scenes documentary which is worth watching, but that's really about it... The quality of the primary content renders this irrelevant anyway.    Speaking of quality, in terms of production and sound -- top notch. My only criticism - and it'sa minor one - is that I'd like the crowd noise to have been brought into the foreground just a notch more for certain songs such as \\"Mr Brightside\\". Other than that, the balance is pretty much perfect.    To put it succinctly; buy this DVD, it's one of the best.
0312427573|4.0|\\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" by Tom Wolfe<br /><br />New York City, early 1980's; Sherman McCoy, a self proclaimed \\"Master of the universe\\" had it all. A loving family, a multi-million dollar Park Avenue apartment and he is the top producing bond salesman for a Wall Street firm which pays him 1 million dollars a year and more if he can close his latest deal. This wasn't enough for Sherman though; he needed, no, deserved more. He is a master of the universe after all. Sherman became involved in an extra marital affair which he deserved and after a wrong turn ends up on the wrong side of the law. Maybe Sherman isn't the Master of the universe he had initially believed...<br /><br />Bonfire made for a great read and Wolfe seems to have really captured the essence of that era. The characters be they the richest of the rich or barely able to afford their one bedroom apartment are all driven by their ego and Wolfe has captured this masterfully. Watching these characters and their rise or fall is what makes this story an interesting read.<br /><br />The Good: Wolfe writes great characters and throughout the story we see some of them go through a complete evolution. None of the characters garner much sympathy from the reader out of the gate but as the story goes on that changes dramatically and by the end you may even find yourself feeling sorry for some them. The lifestyles captured are fascinating if for no other reason that to see how the super wealthy flaunt their power and influence and how no matter how much you make you can still be tapped out.<br /><br />The Bad: The story does feel a little long winded at times but not to the point of ruination.<br /><br />Overall: Wolfe's ability to draw and evolve interesting characters is what makes this journey worth taking. If it sounds interesting then pick it up and give it a try.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|There is no other way to say it:  The Killers Live at Royal Albert Hall is the best live performance DVD of the decade.  Being the best American band this decade has produced the Killers prove once and for all they earned that coveted title.  Playing in front of an excited and loyal british crowd in London makes the DVD all the more exciting.  Brandon Flowers is in perfect voice and commands the stage in all his glory.  Mark and Dave will astonish you with their playing and Ronnie is one of the most exciting drummers in the world to watch.  They play all the songs you want to hear and is equally distributed from their three platnium albums.  I cannot say enough for this DVD.  It just floored me.  5 star rating, it is a must have for any rock fan.  And what a low price!  It is has both the DVD and the CD.  A wonderful gift from this band.  Thank you boys.  You did your fans proud.
B002OB9KPE|2.0|This is Transatlantic's 3rd album and I gotta say , I'm dissapointed. It is again!! too much repetition from Neal Morse. The lyrics are the same as Neal's solo albums,I don't mind them being Christian at all, It's just the same subject matter as earlier albums, especially Lifeline, which was a huge dissapointment also.The arrangments,production? all the same. It's been done to death.I would've like to have heard more of Roine Stolt's singing, and just something different. I do think the stars on this cd are Rone and Pete.Anyway, I hope Neal gets out of this rut soon. Hey Neal...go listen to some Gentle Giant to see how prog is really done.And use a different drummer already!
0810995212|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  The printed reproductions of J.C. Leyendecker's extensive body of work are very well done.  The book layout is stylish and appealing.  As stated by other reviewers, the authors have a viewpoint on the artist and his contemporaries that they strongly defend, oftentimes at the expense of others.  This just made the book even more interesting to me.  Well recommended to graphic artists and illustrators.

How could they...  You'll get better REAL quality from the old releases.  The loudness war lives on.    Second, it's 2009, volume maxing still works!  Hey guys, it isn't clearer, its louder, its dynamically compressed.    You really can fool some of the people all the time......

0385341008|5.0|A brief cruise ship visit to Guernsey this summer piqued my interest in reading this book to learn more about the German occupation there during WWII.  I am very glad it did, as this was the most enjoyable book I have read for a long time.  It was difficult to put down.<br /><br />The book gave me a much better understanding of that terrible but very interesting period in the island's history.  Happily, it did that while entertaining me with amusing, touching, disturbing, and inspiring accounts of characters who seemingly became my friends.  The literary form of telling the story through letters is used here very effectively.  Although this charming little book has been hugely successful, it deserves to be even more widely read.

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|On one hand it's the easiest thing to make a comic book movie -- the characters, the plot, the fan base are already there. On the other hand it's the hardest thing to make a comic book movie -- the characters, the plot, the fan base are already there.     There is an inherent contradiction in \\"Batman\\": a billionaire vigilante who prowls the streets to beat up poor thugs must be a psychopath, megalomaniac, and narcissist -- yet he accepts most social norms, the most important being that murder is wrong. Batman's a psychopath with a conscience -- he's an impossible contradiction.     Nearly everyone before has chosen to ignore this contradiction but the director Christopher Nolan chooses to confront it outright in \\"The Dark Knight\\" by asking what a hero is, and what kind of a hero society needs.     Strangely enough Mr. Nolan chooses to ask these questions by showing what a hero is not -- the real star of the movie is Batman's arch-nemesis the Joker, who in his actions and logic begins and drives the plot of the movie.     The strangest thing about a villain named the Joker is that he's not funny. And he's certainly not mad, otherwise he would make sense. In a hospital scene with another villain Two-Face the Joker tries to explain his motivations -- and is completely incoherent. Joker rails against those \\"with a plan\\" and the order of things but unlike Tyler Durden in \\"Fight Club\\" doesn't point any fingers.     Because he's an amoral thinker and tinkerer of the human condition the Joker would be better off calling himself \\"Philosopher\\" or \\"Professor.\\" Remember how in college you attended classes where a very serious man stood on the lectern and lectured on endlessly with big words and complicated syntax? You have to believe he was talking about something serious but you just don't know what he's talking about, and in the end you have to believe he doesn't know either -- well, that's the Joker in \\"The Dark Knight.\\"     After two and a half hours we learn absolutely nothing concrete about the Joker -- and he's just implausible. He's brilliant but incoherent. He can plan the perfect bank heist, and kill anyone he wants -- but he can't articulate his motives. So we're stuck with this brilliant villain who likes to kill and maim but doesn't know why -- and we all know that what brilliant villains can do best is rationalize -- Hitler and Stalin and Mao all thought they were saviors and saints.     It is impossible to watch the Joker, and not think that this is Heath Ledger playing the Joker. Heath Ledger gives a marvelously subtle performance in \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" and you have to believe he's trying his best to articulate something in \\"The Dark Knight\\" -- possibly re-create Milton's Satan for the 21st century? -- but either the script or the director or the producer doesn't co-operate, and he's left with saying nothing whatsoever. He's trying and he's talking but he's been muted -- isn't that one of the most frustrating, unsatisfying positions an artist can find himself in?     Because of Heath Ledger's death we'll all remember the Joker, and what will we remember about the Joker? That when the whole world was paying attention he said nothing at all.    And how about the director Christopher Nolan? His debut \\"Memento,\\" though rough and jagged and excessive, is still nevertheless powerful and shocking -- one of the best films ever made. And with \\"The Prestige\\" -- his best film to date -- he shows what a very skilled craftsman he is. And \\"The Dark Knight\\" is competently made -- the music is superb, the various subplots weave together nicely, and the cinematography is stunning and innovative. But the director is clearly unsure of what kind of movie he wants to make, or capable of making. Does he want to make eye candy, and delight the 16-year old boys who are the cornerstone of the Summer Blockbuster industry? Or does he want to make a thought-provoking character study that will affirm his status as one of Hollywood's best young filmmakers? Unfortunately he wants both, and the result is thoroughly unsatisfying. He asks hard questions but gives easy answers; he wants to be an artist but he wants to appeal to popular tastes.    And thus the consistent and competent Mr. Nolan may be stuck making consistently competent films all his life, and already Mr. Nolan must be asking: why? \\"The Dark Knight\\" says nothing, and even worse it tries too damn hard to say something.     And then there's Christian Bale. He's proven himself a brilliant actor in \\"American Psycho\\" and \\"The Machinist,\\" and why he's chosen to play a Phallus for two and a half hours is an even harder question than why Joker chooses to kill and why Christopher Nolan chose to direct \\"The Dark Knight.\\" At least the Joker must enjoy killing and Christopher Nolan enjoy directing but Mr. Bale does not look happy playing Batman -- he looks bored out of his mind. Neither Batman nor his alter-ego Bruce Wayne has any personality -- he's a hero, and he's not allowed to have any flaws.    And so let's end with the question we began with: just who is Batman? Again, in our popular culture, Batman is one of the great contradictions. But more importantly he's one of the greatest inventions. Boys all think it'd be cool to be powerful and unique -- they all think they can be a superhero. Parents and teachers rightly are concerned that this aspiration unchecked could easily lead some very special children to become mass murderers. So adults imbue every comic book superhero with a conscience, and adults always tell kids it's this conscience that makes the superhero really a superhero.     Now do kids really buy this? Is a superhero with a conscience really cool? But -- wait a minute -- does a superhero with a conscience make any sense? Isn't the point of having superpowers to do whatever you want, to kill whomever you choose? What's the point of being God if you have follow human laws and rules?     Well, adults get away from these difficult questions by making Batman cool. How? By outlawing him -- by branding him a vigilante, and trying to arrest him. Batman is a misunderstood superhero -- and for kids that's really cool, and if their misunderstood superhero has a conscience that's okay because he's being chased by the police.    That ultimately is how \\"The Dark Knight\\" ends. By becoming a fugitive and being outlawed Batman shows he's cooler than the Joker. We may not know the difference between what's good and what's evil but we certainly know the difference between what's cool and what's not -- and that's more important. Isn't it the coolest thing in the world not to kill but to have everyone think you killed? You have a clean conscience, and you have the respect of all your peers. That's why we can leave the movie theater exhausted but smiling -- we were right to cheer for Batman all along.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you haven't seen this, make it a point to watch this series.  Even if you don't like this genre of film, the imagery is breathe taking and it is educational.  Without going into elaborate detail, I would just like to say that this is one of my favorite pieces of high definition viewing.  And, I could watch this over and over again.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|Ben Stiller is the most consistent media celebrity we have today. He often confuses being stupid with being funny, and his movies are mediocre but they are consistently mediocre and after a decade of his consistently mediocre movies (\\"Zoolander,\\" \\"Dodgeball,\\" \\"A Night at the Museum,\\" etc.) we know how to best watch them: after a hard stressful day's work, laying on the living room couch drinking beer.     \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is yet another mediocre movie with a formulaic hackneyed storyline, stupid dialogue, and a lame, half-hearted performance from Ben Stiller. Yet at the same time the cinematography (shot in the lush beautiful hills and jungles of southeast Asia) is spectacular, the cast is all-star, and there are some genuinely funny and enjoyable moments in the movie. In the movie theater who didn't laugh and smile when that obnoxious Brit Steve Coogan got blown-up? And Tom Cruise gives the best performance of his career, dressed up as a fat and balding tycoon who dances badly to hip hop.    And then there are two superb performances from Stiller's co-stars Jack Black and Robert Downey, Jr. Jack Black is outrageously funny as a heroin-addicted movie star whose signature performance is a fat man who farts. Robert Downey, Jr. is mostly incomprehensible with his slurred but rhythmic late sixties African-American slang and swagger but the idea of him playing an Australian who plays an African-American soldier is funny and it's always fun to watch him on the big screen -- even with this all-star cast Robert Downey Jr. is easily the most talented.     We have to give Ben Stiller credit for understanding the demands and mentality of todays' movie-going audiences. Ben Stiller provides a very light and entertaining film with moments of tremendous hilarity, and he mercifully keeps the experience short -- usually, only about ninety minutes. But we also know that Ben Stiller is a talented comedian, and it seems that nowadays he no longer cares so he no longer tries. The concept of a group of spoiled Hollywood stars filming an action movie only to find themselves in a real-life action situation is juvenile and cliche -- I'm sure that Ben Stiller in grade six had more creative ideas than this.     It's one thing to not care and not try but it's another to moralize at the same time. Halfway through the movie the two nemeses Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. have a silly conversation about playing retards in a movie. The Ben Stiller character says that he invested a lot emotionally into playing a retard, and felt often at times he was indeed a retard. The Robert Downey Jr. character, an Australian method actor who has already won five Academy Awards, replies that the secret is to be retarded without being fully retarded -- Dustin Hoffman in \\"Rain Man\\" and Tom Hanks in \\"Forrest Gump\\" looked retarded but they weren't, and that's what allowed the audience to emotionally identify with them -- and that's why they won Oscars.     I strongly disagree. If you're going to be stupid then just be stupid. The last really good comedy I saw was \\"Blades of Glory,\\" and that was just an outrageously silly affair -- and it made no attempt to disguise its silliness -- how could it be when its two main protagonist, after giving the figure skating performance of a lifetime, shot up to the sky on their skates and sailed the Heavens?     But \\"Tropic Thunder\\" holds back too much, and thus severely restrains the talents of its cast. The movie slowly and cleverly builds up the Jack Black character's heroin addiction, and when he -- after an agonizing couple of days without heroin -- actually finds himself in a heroin warehouse that should be the funniest moment of the whole movie. But the movie holds back -- because drugs are bad for you, I suppose. And then there's Matthew McConaughey who plays the Ben Stiller's character's agent, who when his client gets kidnapped by drug lords, is forced into a moral dilemma -- whether to save his client, or take a bribe from hisHollywood overlords to let his client die. I don't know about you but I think everyone in this whole world would pick a Gulfstream-Five over Ben Stiller but -- because Ben Stiller's the director, I suppose -- the agent chooses Ben Stiller.     I suppose that I can keep on critiquing the movie but at the same time I enjoyed it. And the reason is that I've been meaning to go to a movie for a long time, and there's nothing else out there that's watchable. So it's an advantage to be consistently mediocre when all your competitors are just getting worse and worse.
B002P7UCMC|4.0|I think, compared to previous work from Rammstein, that the instrumental part is fabulous...very strong...very heavy, the way I like it. On the other hand, I was used to stronger lyrics, more disturbing, more shoking...and I missed that in this album (with a view exceptions, of course). But even so it´s a good buy...I recommend it!  ;-)
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is a Woody Allen movie that offers three of the most luminous presences in film today: Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Scarlett Johannson. Because this is a Woody Allen film the characters are cheesy, and the plot very flimsy. The plot centers around two American best friends who are polar opposites of each other: Cautious and prudent Vicky (Rebecca Hall) who is about to marry a successful and stable man who loves her very much, and wild and voluptuous Cristina (Scarlett Johannson) who is on a journey to discover and enjoy life. In Spain for the summer they run into a Spanish artist who just came out of a literally bloody divorce, and who promised the two fun, sex, and self-discovery. After a weekend with the artist Vicky has made love with him, and now questions the very foundation of her life, and Cristina decides the artist is very fun and sexy and so moves in with him. Then the artist's ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) shows up, and after some initial tension the three fall in love with each other. Maria Elena tells Vicky that before the couple was always fighting, and even though they were madly in love with each other they just couldn't be with each other -- something was missing, and that person was Vicky. Vicky completed them, and as the summer comes to an end Vicky sits by the sparkling Spanish coast, and thinks to herself, \\"Well, that's all very good -- but what's in it for me?\\" So she leaves, and after some more misadventures everybody and everything ends up the way they and things were in the beginning.     This is an enjoyable movie, and it's enjoyable because Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Scarlett Johannson are truly great screen presences. Javier Bardem has had a long and storied career, and one of our greatest living actors. He was scary and eery in \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" and now he's charming and nice.     Penelope Cruz made some interesting movies in her native Spain before Hollywood stole and abused her. She was very good in \\"Ham! Ham!\\" (where she starred alongside Javier Bardem) and very bad in everything that she's made for Hollywood. In \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" she is very much the star. She's startling beautiful, and when she's posing for Vicky's camera she's incredibly sultry and sexy. And when she's crazy she's even sexier.     If there's a role that Hollywood leading ladies can play extremely well it's that of the psychopath. Angelina Jolie was absolutely mesmerizing in \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" -- and acting the part of a teenage psychopath you had to think she wasn't acting at all. Ditto for Salma Hayek. She's a terrible actress, and the one good solid credible performance she delivers is in \\"Lonely Hearts\\" where she plays a deranged psychopath who kills as passionately as she loves. In Woody Allen's movie Penelope Cruz playing the part of the neurotic and moody, violent and deranged artist comes across so eloquently and naturally we have think she must be like this in real life as well. Whatever the reason Penelope Cruz is just so fun and pleasant to be with in this movie.    And then there's Scarlett Johannson. Of late she has become Woody Allen's muse and leading lady, having starred in his previous two films (\\"Scoop\\" and \\"Match Point\\"). Seeing her alongside Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz we see her limitations as an actress -- she just doesn't have the presence and charisma of these two brilliant Spanish actors. But she does have Woody Allen who gives her more screen time than anyone else -- even though in this film she is by far the least talented of all the actors.    Once upon a time Woody Allen made fresh and energetic and clever movies. Then he turned his film-making into psychotherapy for himself, and from then on we had to endure Woody Allen's neurotic navel-gazing and mental masturbation. And now Woody Allen's filmmaking is motivated by something else entirely.    For the first thirty minutes of \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" I really couldn't figure what it was. Woody Allen was never a good writer -- his jokes were too forced and too artificial. In this movie all the dialogue is wooden and stiff, and decidedly unfunny -- and we only tolerate the bad dialogue because of Woody Allen's overuse of narration which does keep the film moving at a fairly fast clip and because the bad dialogue is delivered by some of the most accomplished actors we have today. And even though the actors are very good about one-third in I started to get itchy because the movie, quite frankly, just didn't have a story.     Allen's also a very limited film-maker. Many of the transitions in the movie were clumsy and amateurish. Most of the time the cinematography comes across as succinct and economical but there are some moments when the movie looks clumsy and haphazard.     So if Woody Allen's got nothing to say and he's not particularly adept at the technique of film-making why is he still making movies? I was struggling with this question before I finally awoke to the answer staring right in front of me: Scarlett Johannson.     Woody Allen has fallen in love with Scarlett Johannson -- just like the way the artist couple played by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz fell in love with her. Scarlett's sexy, she's young, she's unmolded and extremely impressionable, she's self-absorbed, and at the end of the day she's going to use you and then dump you and then completely forget about you. When Vicky (Scarlett Johannson) tells the artist couple that she needs to leave and discover more of herself Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) becomes angry and says she knew that Vicky would just use them and then when it was no longer fun for her she would just leave. Woody Allen is by far the most narcisstic filmmaker we have today so we have to believe that Woody's subconsciously saying to Scarlett: \\"I love you, I worship you, I've made you into a star and given you more screen time than what aesthetics and audiences would permit but you don't really care about me right? And you could leave me at anytime, right?\\" And how does Scarlett respond to Woody Allen's surrogates in the film? \\"It's not about you, it's about me.\\"    So arguably \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is about Woody Allen's romantic frustrations with his leading lady. Woody Allen's psychotherapy sessions masquerading as films worked commercially because they articulated the phobias and anxieties of his loyal audience. And we're willing to tolerate Woody Allen's new obsession with Scarlett Johannson because let's face it -- we're also obsessed with her. There are many actresses more talented and more beautiful than her -- but she's easily one of the sexiest. And on the big screen she's like a magnet, drawing us in, unable to take our eyes off her. You go, Woody.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|Amazing Grace chronicled the story of William Wilberforce, a key figure behind the British Abolition movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The film had an unfortunate tendency to hop around from \\"the past\\" to \\"the present\\" (which was also the past--dates would have been helpful). But basically, it was a tale well told--nicely filmed, well acted, and with a stirring soundtrack.<br /><br />Like John Newton (the man who wrote the hymn, \\"Amazing Grace\\"), Wilberforce was primarily motivated by a conversion to Evangelical Christianity. Although little is made of his conversion in the film, this epiphany continued to inspire him throughout his life and provided the basis for many of the social reforms he championed.<br /><br />While Amazing Grace was true to the spirit of the times, there were some significant inaccuracies. Departures from real history are expected in films, and I wouldn't normally point them out. However, in this case, the discrepancies tended to detract from the film rather than enhance it. First, John Newton, Wilberforce's friend and religious model, was an Anglican priest, not a rag-clothed penitent. It was not until late in his life that Newton repented of his earlier slave-trading days, and by then he had a congregation. Depicting Newton as someone who scrubbed floors in a burlap sack lent a distinctly melodramatic, off-key note to the story.<br /><br />The second major discrepancy is that Wilberforce was in his seventies when the act to abolish slavery throughout the British Empire was finally passed. (He died a mere three days later.) In the movie he was shown as middle-aged, which, while better for the love story, really didn't capture the dedication of a man who literally spent his entire adult life devoted to the abolitionist cause.<br /><br />Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a high school class (students need to get their facts straight), Amazing Grace was a good, solid introduction to the history of the abolitionist movement. One can only imagine the course American history would have taken if the Revolution had occurred after the passage of the anti-slavery acts, rather than before.ne the course American history would have taken if the Revolution had occurred after the passage of the anti-slavery acts, rather than before.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" tells the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn, the woman who manipulated Henry the Eighth into separating from the Vatican and who gave birth to Elizabeth, Britain's greatest monarch.    When Catherine of Aragon is unable to produce a male heir for the king (Eric Bana) the Boleyn family plays political intrigue, assigning Anne (Natalie Portman) to be Henry the Eighth's mistress. But Henry the Eighth prefers the younger sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson), and beds her. Dejected and angry Anne secretly marries the young lord Henry Percy, an impetuous act that is rewarded with her exile in France where she completes her education in the ways of man. Upon her return Anne seduces Henry the Eighth, manipulates him into rejecting her younger sister, the queen, and the Vatican. Branded as a witch by the English public Anne gives birth to Elizabeth, and then loses a child in a miscarriage. Fearing for her life and clearly growing insane Anne tries to get her brother George to impregnate her, and the king hears about this and beheads both.    When we first learn that Natalie Portman is to play the wildly ambitious seductress Anne and Scarlett Johansson her wide-eyed innocent sister we're forced to think that there's been a terrible mix-up in casting. But Natalie Portman is the anchor of the film, holding together a flimsy and sometimes incoherent script and yet another half-hearted performance by Scarlett Johansson.    Natalie Portman will be remembered as the greatest star of her generation -- the Audrey Hepburn of our times. She lacks the stunning overwhelming beauty of Audrey Hepburn but she is far more talented and versatile. She was terrible in the Star Wars trilogy but so was everyone else, and since then she has given nothing but competent performances. In \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" her character isn't all that believable and developed, her supposed transformation halfway through the movie isn't really noticeable, and it's hard to figure out why Henry the Eighth becomes so infatuated with her -- and yet despite all these stark flaws in the script and direction Natalie Portman's still compelling to watch: she's just stunningly beautiful draped in vermillion, and she makes the usually sexy Scarlett Johansson look dull and ditzy.    Ironically Portman's brilliant performance only hurts the film. The film is designed to be a tragedy, centering around a family that suddenly rises and then suddenly falls because of their overwhelming thirst for power. It is this blind famly ambition that would create Anne Boleyn, a woman who's either evil or insane and who almost singlehandedly managed to tear England apart. Countering Anne is good and noble Mary, who almost loses her soul to her family's ambition but in the end learns to trust her goodness. So what does it say about the direction of the film and the film itself when at the end we really don't care about Mary, and we don't want Anne to be beheaded even after we've seen Anne destroy her younger sister, destroy the good queen, and try to bed her brother?    Clearly directors need to learn to control Natalie Portman better. She's not yet as famous and powerful as Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise but already she can warp a film -- in a very uncanny Anne Boleyn way -- around her. The good news is that unlike Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise she is talented, and when she finds a script and meets a director worthy of her talent the result will be truly mesmerizing.
0316001821|4.0|I liked this a lot, especially at the beginning. There were some very powerful emotions and fascinating perspectives throughout the book - in places. But on the whole it tended to wander along. The popularity of this book is not justified by the hype.<br /><br />It's not exactly a murder mystery or suspense novel (and I'm sure that Sebold wrote with that in mind), but I found myself wanting more *action*. The little interaction between Suzie (as a ghost) and her family seems mostly incidental to the story itself. The one time she 'falls to earth' is nice, but could be edited out of the story without hurting it at all. Even the moment of 'revenge' near the end was almost a footnote it was such a brief aside.<br /><br />I predict this may be one of those few times I prefer the movie to the book.
0790732254|3.0|There are a few distinctively American artists -- Norman Mailer comes immediately to mind. And then there are many more pale imitators of European art that happen to be American, and are rewarded because of American chauvinism. Edward Albee falls into the latter camp. There's something powerful and authentic when Samuel Beckett and Albert Camus write about the meaningless and absurdity of the human condition but when Edward Albee writes there's something wildly immature and annoying.    Albee's first work \\"Zoo Story\\" which is a childish imitation of \\"Waiting for Godot\\" can be forgiven as exactly that: a childish imitation. But what are Albee's excuses for \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?\\"    George (Richard Burton) is a middle-aged small-town college history professor who is married to the college president's daughter Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). Once full of promise and vitality George now resorts to alcohol and bitter violent fights with Martha to pass the time. One night they invite over a couple who are a younger, much more vibrant version of themselves -- and the two take this as an opportunity to reflect on the life they cursed themselves with.    Because Edward Albee is considered a genius and because \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\\" is considered one of the greatest films of all time I searched for meaning and substance in the film, and after forty minutes I became desperately bored, began fast forwarding, and then eventually just gave up. There were moments when I did feel that the film was trying to say something but decided it wasn't true because the film didn't really develop that theme and that theme was really juvenile anyway -- I mean, would a serious playwright use for his masterwork the theme that marrying for money and position will only make you miserable?    In the end I could only conclude that this film is merely a visual projection of all the anxieties and phobias, self-loathing and narcissims -- in short, the collected mental masturbation -- of aplaywright who just happens be homosexual and childish and depressed. The articulate protagonist is a stand-in for the playwright, someone so witty and luminous yet underappreciated by the world and trapped in an impossible situation with a hysterical wife. The wife Martha represents either the playwright's mother or just a generic impression of all women: violent and insane, selfish and self-indulgent, a whore and a witch.    Albee then takes this disjointed and incoherent worldview, and slaps on a flimsy and hackneyed plot, and puts it on stage -- and everyone calls it art and genius. So why do you hate yourself and the world so much, Mr. Albee, when life is this easy and wonderful?    To be fair this play was written almost half a century ago when psychology wasn't so developed. Back then they did not understand what was \\"co-dependency\\" and \\"bipoloar depression\\" and \\"borderline personality disorder\\" and writers could only re-create these things on paper from the rough sketches of their personal lives. But so what? Great writers are great because they are overly attuned into the peculiar nuances of the human condition: Shakespeare did not have to major in psychology to create the convincing and powerful psychological portraits of Hamlet and MacBeth and King Lear and Othello.    It is perhaps all too common to fear and to misunderstand something, and then quickly dismiss it as \\"crazy\\" or worse \\"genius.\\" \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\\" is in the lucky position to find itself labelled as \\"genius\\" by a society that fears and misunderstands it more than it appreciates and understands it.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I love how this film was done.  It was a \\"down-to-earth\\" tender story about finding love, building a future and that sometimes families are defined through interpersonal interactions more so than by blood.  It was about realizing your dreams, manifesting them through multiple challenges, and about the sacrifices that Love sometimes requires.  It was realizing that it was better to live honestly, be true to your nature, and of overcoming one's fears. I was impressed by the simplicity of the scenes and the richness in their content.  I liked the choice of neighborhoods and the lack of pretentiousness.  It was nice seeing it based in San Pedro California near to where I grew up, and at some of the local surfing places I used to go with friends that are not as \\"straight\\" as some would like to believe.  This film is a definite keeper.
1594488878|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think it's a bit (or a lot) more subtle than previoius Hornby books like \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About a Boy.\\"  Some middle aged angst and sorting through life's meaning and so forth.  And I totally loved it.  It was great the way he brought in modern on-line / connected culture stuff.  His writing is still deceptively simple but he definitely makes you think.  Anyways, get the book and enjoy it.  Lots of fun and laughter.  Five stars for pure pleasure but with depth from one our time's best authors.

She showed how loving someone can be so scary..esp if the love is not the same.  The author showed feelings in these characters that I feel no other author could find. From title page to conclusion, Jodi Picoult had my feelings and my mind.  Great Book.

And if you haven't, you're in a mess no matter what. All the liquidity in the world isn't going to save you from pain, suffering, and probably a loss of money.\\" Value investing does work. Combining this strategy with a high growth strategy you are able to invest in fast money stocks while keeping your risk relatively low, and that is ultimately the key.
0316069906|5.0|This book was a catalyst where I wasn't looking for one. After the first 35 pages a light bulb started lighting up...and I feared my life was about to change. I've never written a book review, but after reading what Jonathon learned in his 3 + years of researching factory farming, I had to tell others to read it.  He provides serious, horrific and real information. I never knew about factory farming until I read his book and googled 'factory farming' on the web. It was all over from there. I started watching those videos on what we do to animals-the ones we don't want to see-and I could not stomach another bite of an animal again. I loved meat, ate it easily 3xday for all of my life, grew up near those green pastures in northern California where cows graze all day. Wow. Was I disconnected and fooled...<br /><br />What I felt, was that he did not preach about not eating animals. He presented information that I could personally relate to and grasp. For me, Jonathon felt like a  messenger...where many have failed to bring light to what humans are systematically doing to animals every moment of every day. He provided very important information about 99% of the animals I used to buy and eat for my family and friends. I had no idea that the US alone consumes 10 billion animals PER YEAR. I finally woke up. One chicken has 2 wings(that they never use)--how many chicken wings come in a basket at a restaurant-6? 12? 24? I used to throw meat away after getting full. I was throwing away a life-a wasted one who suffered in life and in death. What frightened me more about this book is why is an author bringing this info to me? Where are the ongoing news specials on this?<br /><br />Jonathon's personal tone, statistical/historical data, research team, true accounts from the field, letters, etc., left me no choice than to agree with him. Of course, he is not a farm owner, hasn't worked on a farm, and can't come from a place of truly understanding 'farming'. And he doesn't shun farming, he actually helped me realize that the farming I thought ALL animals came from--humane ones--are actually a miniscule percentage of all farms. His writing is heartwarming, but gut-wrenching. His occasional wit about the insanity of factory farming made me laugh quietly, but kept me awake at night thinking & fretting.<br /><br />Eating Animals forced me to realize the terrifying component of being lied to by these factory farms and the megacorporations that support them. I used to pay extra for organic milk & cage free eggs because I believed in Horizon Farms. I thought I was making a better choice for the animals. Ultimately, the author woke me up from a deep, deep sleep. As he eloquently presents about turkeys, how can we celebrate 'thanks' and 'family' or whatever tradition you have on Thanksgiving while the main course never saw the sun, felt the earth, a breath of fresh air, had his beak seared off with a hot blade and no pain killers, lived on top of thousands of other turkey's and their excrement, thrown into trucks for transport hundreds of miles without food or water, and never had one true moment of 'love.'

But feminists fear not, the men have their own foibles. Richard G's snakecharming money hungry lawyer can make you love and hate the system all at the same time.

B0014VPFTA|4.0|The big handed John Meyer has grown up before our very ears. While he was a younger guitar godlet, his musical range (especially lyrically) was still that of a kid. He wanted to break away from that mold with his power trio album, [[ASIN:B000BJS4SU Try! Live in Concert]], it isn't until now that Mayer sounds like his own man. \\"Waiting For the World To Change\\" is the calling card, when he sings<br /><br />\\"One day our generation<br />is gonna rule the population,<br />so we keep on waiting,<br />waiting on the world to change.\\"<br /><br />You can see the youthful kid become a more idealistic adult. And those \\"Clapton Jr\\" comments that have swirled around him? They are now 100% apt. Mayer is flowing his blues as naturally as they come. When he tackles Hendrix's \\"Bold As Love,\\" you have to admire his guts. \\"Belief\\" and \\"Vultures\\" are mature songs that show a huge leap from [[ASIN:B0000ALSDR Heavier Things]], where his sound and lyrics are fully formed and beautiful.<br /><br />His band, now under the core of bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Steve Jordan, mixes rock and blues, pop and jazz in a smooth and clear and cool finished CD. The dictionary defines continuum as \\"A continuous extent, succession, or whole, no part of which can be distinguished from neighboring parts except by arbitrary division\\" and the seamlessness of the 2008 model of John Mayer meets that definition. \\"Continuum\\" is the work of an artist approaching the peak of his powers, and rates as an album in the league of his older peers.
1416550542|5.0|I'm an avid reader, reading two or so books a week.  Over a year obviously I consume a lot of books.  Many of the books I read I enjoy but then the details of the book slowly vanishes from my memory.  Not so with The Forgotten Garden.  It is an excellent story.

B001MEJY8W|1.0|This is a copy of my Netflix review.    This movie sucks. It starts out with little Lucie escaping from...well, somewhere, then shows us how she bonds with Anna, another girl at, presumably, an orphanage. Then it skips ahead to when they're both young women and Lucie's tracked down the people who kept her prisoner earlier. Then.... I watched this whole thing just to see what the point of it all was, and guess what? THERE'S NO POINT!! This is nothing but torture porn, sort of like FUNNY GAMES but with fewer laughs. Man, those Europeans really give Eli Roth a run for his money! Avoid this film, not because of the violence, but because it's simply a big waste of time....
0393307050|1.0|I tried reading this book a few years ago, but only got about a quarter of the way through before I got sick(not because of the book!) and moved onto other reading while I recovered.  This week, I tried again...and made it almost halfway through before realizing there was a big problem...I simply couldn't force myself to care enough to finish!  O'Brian was clearly an intelligent man, with a remarkable grasp of the subject matter, but that simply isn't enough to make 'Master and Commander' worth reading. As an author, his narrative voice is far too dry, stuffy, and disconnected-a problem with other authors of his generation(such as P.D. James), who tried to make up for the shortcomings of a story by burying it in an overabundance of research, and verbiage. The 200 or so pages I read came nowhere close to delivering what was promised by the blurb on the back cover: '...all the action and excitement which could possibly be hoped for in a historical novel'. There is certainly development of the characters, from what I saw, as Aubery, Maturin, and Dillon, in particular, show promise that must have ben realized in later books.  The problem is that there is very little action in this book, and far too many nautical terms, which, as other readers suggested, really needed an appendix to help newbie/'landlubber' readers. O'Brian just didn't 'sound' like a polished author of fiction when he wrote this book; he made it sound too much like a textbook on sailing terminology, and opted for a much too leisurely, languid, pace. I'm sure, as others have said, that this was the 'shakedown voyage' for the Aubery-Maturin series, and that O'Brian grew more comfortable with storytelling, and allowed his characters to take over the story. I'm just not convinced, after struggling with this story, that I want to try again.  I am interested in other historical fiction of this period, such as the 'Hornblower' series, or the 'Blind Justice' series by Bruce Alexander, set more or less in the same time period. I just prefer that such stories have interesting, engaging characters; dialogue that doesn't put the readers to sleep, or make them 'skip over' long, boring passages; and, most of all, something exciting happening  more than approximately once every hundred pages!
0385504225|3.0|Parts of the book stand up to what you expect from Dan Brown. Other parts seemed contrived. The beginning was slower than his other Langdon adventures, and the ending seemed much more pointless (and, as a non-deist, potentially a mite offensive). The identity of the villain was evident only about a quarter of the way through the book, so for Brown to continually try to \\"trick\\" the reader until the other characters were ready to discover his identity just seemed disingenuous. Not a bad adventure--but not Brown's best work.
0385532458|4.0|See numerous summaries above.<br /> Okay, I normally don't read short stories, but when I saw Grisham's name on this one and some advanced reviews I decided to give it a shot. Didn't short stories usually have some sort of surprise at the end? While these seven shorts were easy and entertaining enough to read they didn't give me any \\"Wow!, I didn't see that coming\\" surprises. Quality writing and interesting characters chronicling a county in Mississippi gave this a passing review.
0140186395|5.0|Calling East of Eden \\"Steinbeck's masterpiece\\" is a bit misleading, like saying JFK was Joe's \\"best kid.\\" It depends on your criteria, for starters. If I could only save one Steinbeck novel from a fire, it would be Grapes of Wrath, not East of Eden. East of Eden begins with a few hundred pages of sentences you can savor one after the other. Once Caleb and Aron come along, things bog down a bit, and that sense that you are spending every minute with something delicious and fine wavers a bit. But Steinbeck pulls it all together in the final pages, and it's worth the wait.<br /><br />This is not a novel for the impatient. If you are looking for sex and violence, chances are your tastes are too jaded to appreciate what you will find here. Steinbeck doesn't tell you in gynecological detail what she does with the cigarette, for example, or devote a dozen pages to Cathy's beating. It's not a novel for the flippantly cynical; I don't share Steinbeck's opinion, but his fundamental belief in the goodness of humankind is touching and admirable, because it is not just polyester sentiment.<br /><br />Mercifully for the reading illiterate, Elia Kazan's film is brilliant and reasonably close to the novel, so you can \\"know\\" East of Eden without the bother of reading it. But if you have an interest in the writer's craft, you will be missing something special. The almost mystic lyricism of Grapes of Wrath is modulated here into an elegaic prose, and Steinbeck's politics are not on the forestage. But Sam Hamilton and Lee are American types no one captured more accurately and completely, and Lee's insistence, that the story of Cain is THE story, the only story, turns out, as things come to a close, to make more sense than one might wish.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|Bon Jovi doesn't reinvent themselves with this album, they continue to grow with their fans and evolve. Jon is right there with the power vocals, anthem songs, and lyrics that really make you think. Richie not only looks the best he has in years, he blows me away on \\"We Weren't Born to Follow\\" and \\"Thorn in My Side,\\" with his guitar skills.  The album also seems to be the launch for their next tour with tickets going onsale around the country and in London around now too. No doubt songs from The Circle will be a part of the tour, but the veteran rocker's definitely put on a solid 2-hour show that will have me down front and blasting The Circle in the car all the way home!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Every Christmas, a parade of family-oriented DVDs flood stores, some very good, most mediocre and quickly forgettable, but this season, may I suggest a Classic that isn't holiday-oriented, but has more heart and love than you'll find in a stocking-full of themed releases? I strongly recommend 1995's \\"Babe\\".<br /><br />A live-action (enhanced with puppets and animation) tale of an orphaned pig (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh), the understanding farmer who 'adopts' him (James Cromwell, who is FABULOUS!), and the barnyard animals who become his family, the film sparkles from the opening credits until the closing ones, enriched by a warm, wise narration by Roscoe Lee Browne. Chapters are introduced by three of the most lovable mice you'll ever encounter, and the chapter about Christmas, while only a small part of the story, is hilarious (the farm's somewhat paranoid duck, realizing what the main course of the holiday dinner will be, shrieks \\"Christmas is CARNAGE!\\").<br /><br />While most farm-oriented family films tend to be either too juvenile or too cloyingly saccharin, \\"Babe\\" never falls into either rut, succeeding in being cute enough to enchant children, and sly enough to appeal to adults...and it is very, very funny, to boot! I dare you NOT to smile when Farmer Hoggett sings and dances for the sick pig, or when Babe does his 'stuff' at the Sheepdog Championship (I, myself, get teary-eyed, but I'm a sentimental kind of guy!)<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"Babe\\", or are searching for a movie the entire family will enjoy, you can't do better than this!

1577314808|5.0|Having listened to the unabridged audio version at least 5 times, I thought it time to write a review of the book. Eckhart tolle's words are unwasted, skilfully measured, for maximum effect: Awakening. True to its course, it achieves this by bringing the person back to the awareness of the body, the gateway to our perceptions. What's more, he gives more hints as to how to go about Being in the present moment. Such things as \\"Watch the thinker\\", \\"Feel your aliveness\\", \\"Observe the silence that's in you\\", \\"Surrender to the Now\\" have all helped me to magnify and bring about this stage of presence which he speaks about. I would also suggest the book \\"Practicing the Power of Now\\", for a condensed version of how to put into action the major highlights in this book.    I've met some teachers that made Being into something complex, quasi-inachievable, and only allowed to the elite few. None of this is the case with this author, who seems to resound the wonderfully simple message that we can have a similar experience as his, simply by being aware of the Now moment. Buried by our past memories, sometimes accompanied with guilt, and anxiety about an uncertain future, we tend to cut ourselves off from this Now perception, to our disadvantage. This book made me understand the teaching that \\"It's all happening right now\\", and whatever states of consciousness people such as Tolle have had, is at hand for me and all of us, if we simply acknowledge it.     I will speak to the detractors of this book, who have said that it is \\"New Age\\", and \\"promotes a trance state\\". If anything, Tolle's ideas are based on solid information coming at once from Sufism, Hinduism, Christianity, Non-dualistic thinking, the Perennial philosophy, to name but a few. When one develops mystical thinking, truth is seen and felt in all paths. This is why he is able to draw commonalities in many traditions. As to the trance state, I would say quite the contrary, in that he brings people to a higher awareness ofthemselves rather than a submissive and weakened state. If you experience this for yourself, it will be evident that you feel more alive and vibrant, rather than out of it.    In conclusion, this book has done more to help find myself and become further aware of my Being. I've since been using some of the mindfulness techniques in my work as a psychotherapist, and it's been beneficial towards my clients. Reading and listening to this author has made me feel more appreciative towards life. If there's a price for that, it's certainly that of this book.

B000BT97AO|3.0|visually stunning film, the story is pretty much the Wizard of Oz. There's a sort of empty quality to it, though, which leaves me feeling like I missed something. I bought it, I watch it sometimes, I would say I like it. I would even say, \\"watch it\\" to pretty much anyone. But don't expect to walk away from this feeling like you've really experienced much of anything. Don't expect to be impressed. It's not going to become your favorite movie or anything.

B000FS9FCG|3.0|For a lot of people, tell them a film is based on a graphic novel -- a \\"comic book\\" -- and they immediately write it off as juvenile. Some of us know better, though. The fact that the story a movie came from appeared first in another graphic medium has very little to do with anything. You have to evaluate the film on its own merits. This one is a combination of adventure fantasy -- bigger-than-life hero vs. superbad villains -- and political cautionary tale. It's a couple of decades in the future, the U.S. has collapsed economically and politically and is mired in civil war, and England has fallen into an authoritarian, fascist nightmare, largely with the acquiescence of its own people. Into all this steps a man in a Guy Fawkes mask with a vendetta against those in power for what they did to him in his earlier life. In the book, V's cause is anarchy; in the film, it's English freedom. (Alan Moore loathed the change in theme as \\"Americanization,\\" but revolution plays better in Hollywood if it's in support of democracy.) Though we never see the real, damaged face of V, the voice behind the mask is that of Hugo Weaving -- and a great voice it is, too. Natalie Portman plays Evey, the only survivor of a family that was wiped out piecemeal by the fascists, and the story also is about her climb up from constant fear. John Hurt is excellent as Sutler, the frothingly menacing Head Chancellor who glares out from an oversize TV screen like Big Brother in \\"1984.\\" There are plenty of plot holes, mostly having to do with the ease with which V gets in and out of very high-security places to commit his executions. On the other hand, the Wachowski brothers also were responsible for the \\"Matrix\\" films, so you know the sfx are going to be above average -- especially the final shoot-out in the tube station and the destruction of the Houses of Parliament as witnessed by thousands of Londoners in Guy Fawkes masks. Not a bad flick, and it's obviously destined to be a cult film, but it would have been interesting to see what the Wachowskis could have done by sticking closer to the themes and details of the book.ld have been interesting to see what the Wachowskis could have done by sticking closer to the themes and details of the book.
B0009S2T0M|3.0|15 years' imprisonment, followed by five days of vengeance. But there's a twist: Oh Dae-su has not escaped from prison, he was released. The reason is the film's mystery, and as he attempts to solve it, it becomes clearer that someone is one step ahead of him.    Something of a spoiler follows, so stop now if you want to avoid it. It's not easy for me to figure out why I felt this film was a letdown. A lot of it I think has to do with the resolution. The tragedy seems neither justified in light of the characters and their actions nor adequately prepared in view of the what's on screen leading up to it. For three-quarters of the film we have something the look (apart from rough dentistry) and pace of which might fit Jason Statham (and I don't mean that as an insult). Then the last 20 minutes are supposed to hit us with the force of Greek tragedy -- all engineered, moreover, by the bad guy, and implausibly so. On the whole it is unconvincing.    Not something I regret seeing, because it's different from what's made available at the multiplex. But it won't be going on any list of favorites either.
B00288KNL8|4.0|This is a wonderfully original and imaginative stop-motion animated rendering of Neil Gaiman's juvenile book of the same name. Dakota Fanning is the voice of Coraline Jones, an adolescent girl whose parents have dragged her off to an apartment in an isolated hilltop Victorian so they can finish writing a gardening catalog. Though bored out of her mind, she's also adventurous and self-reliant, and it's not long before she discovers the secret door hidden behind the wallpaper in the parlor that gives her access to an alternative world with apparently wonderful alternative parents. Of course (as a story like this requires), not all is as it seems in that distorted world. The other tenants include the retired circus man, Mr. Bobinsky, and the elderly Misses Spink and Forcible (and their wall full of stuffed deceased terriers), and a feral cat with very fixed opinions when it comes to rats, and who attempts to give Coraline good advice which she waits almost too long to listen to. The plot is classic cautionary (and rather dark) fairy tale and the character details and bits of business are classic Gaiman. [I note most of the one-star reviews are actually complaints about the rendering of the 3-D content. Frankly, I didn't even know it *was* 3-D. And I don't especially care.]
1601251831|5.0|It's rare to come across a roleplaying product that advertises what it does, delivers exactly that and still leaves you smiling with pleasure.<br /><br />The Pathfinder Beastiary simplifies and codifies a lot of what became very cludgy with 3.5 gaming mechanics. Rather than giving the rules for improved grab (now just \\"grab,\\" which makes sense as 3.5 never had a \\"grab\\" option anyway) and trample in each monster description, it just notes that they have these attack modes. If you want more information on those attacks, there's an appendix in the back, clearly labelled, that has all those rules for you. I love the use of visual icons to describe the monsters - you can flip through the book rather quickly and just look for the icons rather than try to train your brain to pick up the words \\"temperate hills\\" on each page. And the icons will always be on the same level on the page because there's only and always one to two monster entries per page. Pathfinder understands: this is a book, not a scroll.<br /><br />The ruels for monster advancement feel looser than in 3.5 and at first seemed daunting but after running through them three or four times, I found I was moving much, much faster than I ever did adjusting monsters in 3.5, and the results were more satisfying - the creatures felt like new creations, not like the same monster, only with more hit dice.<br /><br />I do miss some of the monsters from 3.5 - the illithids are gone, as are the umber hulks - but that's a copyright issue and no fault of Paizo and, hey, free froghemoth. Who doesn't love the froghemoth?<br /><br />Based on this book, I am saving up my dollars and cents for some of the other Pathfinder products in the hopes that their design and layout are as keen as this book's. The main handbook is fantastic, but Paizo really hit it out of the park with their beastiary.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This is one of those films that -- if you read and re-read the book as so many have -- you look forward to with both anticipation and a bit of dread. Because they could so easily have screwed this up. But I'm pleased, and a little surprised, to find that the film follows the book pretty closely -- in all the important ways. Because the book isn't really about superhero crimefighters. It's about people, both good and bad, and how they fit together. And the film pulls it off very well. The character of the uncompromisingly absolutist Rorschach, the most interesting character in both the book and the film, is very nicely rendered. Even Dr. Manhattan, the least \\"human\\" character, is portrayed in multiple dimensions. I think they made a good decision in not giving any of the roles to a headlining actor. No Nicholas Cage, no Gwyneth Paltrow to steal the scenes. You can pay attention to the roles the actors are playing, not the actors themselves. And, yeah, there's a lot of gore in this film, . . . but that's a human thing, too. Even the fight scenes are more explicit than you would expect (this is definitely not a kids' film), but that's to make a point. Because there's also a morality tale here about how things can so easily go wrong with society. The world is facing nuclear annihilation and it's largely because the forces of violently coercive conservatism are in control -- typified by the Comedian, who kills women and children without batting an eye, and by the fact that Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as president. Even Dan Dreibeg and Laurie Jupiter, the putative Good Guys, are out there on the right wing somewhere, trying to make the world their version of a \\"better place.\\" This take on the 1980s is not the Good Old Days that might have been. And, of course, there's the overarching question: Is it right to do great evil in the successful pursuit of even greater good? The film actually seems much more explicit than the book about the \\"alternate universe\\" aspect of the story, right from the outset in the credits -- which do a very nice job of summarizing the back-story, incidentally. But let's face it, a lot of people went to see this flick for the special effects, and those are great -- and without getting in the way of the live action, which is quite an accomplishment. Especially everything surrounding Dr. Manhattan. There are lots of great quotable lines, most of them directly from the book. My favorite: \\"None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me.\\" The choice of `80s songs for the soundtrack also is very interesting; most of them fit the atmosphere of the story, even the actual plotline. (Except for \\"99 Luft Balloons\\": What in the world is that doing in there?) All in all, an excellent screen version of an excellent book. I expect to be revisiting both of them at regular intervals in the future.

B002KREVCO|5.0|Amazon delivered this right on release day.  I immediately started up CD #1.  These are the songs that have been on foreign releases only to be heard on expensive imports or murky copies floating around.  Now they are remastered and bring Bon Scott back from the dead and some lost tracks from Brian Johnson. It does make a fan wish that there were two parallel AC/DC bands creating music over the last thirty years with Bon Scott still penning lyrics and singing in version 1 and Brian singing in version 2.    1. Stick Around: Bon Scott: 9/10  2. Love Song: Bon Scott: A ballady song.  Glad they only made one love song.  Still good to hear Bon. great guitar  3. Fling Thing: Primarily an instrumental right out of a Scottish pub.    4. RIP: Bon Scott: A cranker upper 8/10  5. Carry Me Home: Bon Scott:   6. Crabsody in Blue: Bon.  Lyrics only Bon would sing.  It will make you itch hearing about getting crabs. 9/10  7. Cold Hearted Man: Bon.  Dark lyrics, blues style guitar.  10/10  8. Snake Eyes: Brian Johnson One of the better 80s tracks  9. Borrowed Time: Brian Good stadium thumper   10. Down on the Borderline: Great rhythm and Brian in great voice 8/10  11. Big Gun: The only thing good about Last Action Hero.  The video on disk #3 is hilarious.  Arnold carrying around Angus like a little Chucky doll.  12. Cyberspace: Ac/dc singing about computer stuff.  Good to have, but like the Love Song, there was a reason to keep in a B-side.  Still, fun to listen to.    CD #2: Live tracks.  I wish there was more of Bon era live stuff.  Brian's era is recorded with higher end equipment and he tears the roof off material never released live before on CD.      DVD: Rock and Roll with Angus turning up in the strangest places.  The making of video makes you appreciate the fact that Angus is willing to take some risks, do all of his own stunts and put himself in harm's way.  Reveals what a great band they are still having fun making blistering rock.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Addictive!! Thats how i describe this show, simply addictive. I love vampires and their world and this show gives a new fresh feeling to a well known subject. Heads Up Book Fans!!! I have read all of books in The Southern Vampire Mysteries and the show is not precisely based on the books, more like loosely inspired by. We have the same characters we love, some of the same rules and the basic story-line. But the series is definitely independent. Still i love it; is a great vampire show, not necessarily a good book translation, but a great show nonetheless.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sexy (bordering horny), character-driven (a lot of drama going on), supernatural drama this is your show. Get it, banned the minors from the room, and enjoy!!!<br /><br />However if you are expecting to see a play-by-play of the book you might want to get it borrowed or rented first instead of buying. To be fair to the production of this show the first season basically encompasses the ups and downs of young Telepath Sookie Stackhouse and the beggining of her involvement in a fantastic world she never dream could possibly exist; close enough to how it goes on the first book, Dead Until Dark.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Have the past 13 years just been a nightmare? Did Layne finally pull it together and kick the drug addiction that was tearing this band apart?    Of course the answers to both questions are no. An uninspired unplugged album that left the very talented Sean Kinney practically incapacitated as a musician, an obligatory greatest hits album, two Jerry Cantrell solo albums, and the tragic death of Layne Staley left this band as good as dead.     Roaring back like it is 1996 all over again, it's like Alice in Chains never missed a beat. This album is a true Alice in Chains album that none of its long time fans could have ever dreamed of hearing after Layne passed away.    Time and location seemed to lead this band to getting pigeon holed into a genre that included such bands as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and the Stone Temple Pilots. The palm muted 'E' guitar riffing confused those of us who could detect the speed metal influence that nodded back to the humble beginnings. That, along with the untimely bus crash of Death Angel led to their rather bizarre invitation to open for Clash of the Titans, where they were nightly tormented during their 20 minute sets by metal heads who just wanted to see Slayer rip into Raining Blood. This left music fans scratching their heads as to how to classify the great Alice in Chains.     This album, with its diversity of well written songs, shows the music world that they couldn't and still can't be pigeon holed into any genre. They are simply Alice in Chains, and this album shows the music world what we had the misfortune of missing for the past 13 years. Well done and welcome back!
1400031354|1.0|This book was a gift, and I'm game for reading just about anything.  I believe beauty is in the eye of the beholder: I can't tell someone they should enjoy the same books I enjoy, and vice versa.  This is the only book I've ever felt was so poorly written that it was worth spending time to write a negative review.<br /><br />It felt like it was not edited- painfully inconsistent grammar and punctuation.  The writing style is indeed smooth- so smooth that the narrator, the female detective (a Botswana native), the male auto repair garage owner (another Botswana native), and the widowed American who was married to a diplomat all have the same voice.  I prefer characters who are unique over ones I can't distinguish between.<br /><br />For a simply story, it would have been better if it were simply, AND clearly, written.  It felt like there were more words (that did nothing for the story) than needed.  Maybe Mr. McCall Smith likes to add useless words to make the book longer, I've never seen anything like it.  He also uses words that don't fit terribly well- I wouldn't want my kids reading this and thinking this is good grammar with clearly used words.<br /><br />Not as much fun as Harry Potter, not as relaxed as Hemingway, and not as insightful as The Alchemist.  I'm sorry my friend spent their money buying it for me, as there are plenty of light reading books out there written much better.  I really wanted to like this book, as I love the concept and setup; unfortunately the poor writing and editing didn't let me.
B002T09BPE|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  I had not heard any of Orianthi's music prior to her being part of Michael Jackson's movie and on a local radio station promoting this new CD.  I really enjoyed her interview on the radio and listening to her play a few of the songs from this album.  I immediately went to Amazon and purchased this.  I am so glad I did.  I have listened to it over and over several times.  There are so many great songs and her guitar playing is phenomenal.  You will not be sorry buying this CD.
0385504225|2.0|I really like the rest of Dan Brown's books, but this one was not worth the money my boyfriend paid for it.  It took me, a rather quick reader, over a month to finish.  I'd pick it up, read a (2-3 page) chapter, then put it down again.      There really was no point of having Noetic science play a part in the story-it never mattered in the end.  Why even discuss it?  Any intrigue Brown tried to put into the story was worthless in the end.  I'm still not quite sure what the Lost Symbol was supposed to be.  To me, this story dragged on, and the end was quite the let down.  At times it was very farfetched.  I suggest you get it from the library instead of wasting your money on buying this book.
0385342020|2.0|This is an open letter to Dial Books:  I have enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's novels as light entertainment, but I am dismayed that you have published Twenties Girl without benefit of a good editor.  Nothing discredits good writing more than careless over-repetition of a word or phrase (\\"rictus smile,\\" \\"wrong-footed,\\" \\"insouciant\\").  Similarly, I was bewildered by Ed's jarringly frequent use of the f-word; in the light-hearted genre of chick-lit, a little casual profanity goes a long way.  Lara's character was formulaic -- well-intentioned and sincere but naive and, like Becky, inclined to lie her way out of tight spots -- and that is how Kinsella (and Dial Books) sells books.  But Kinsella needs a more economical approach to word count:  she introduces more characters and plot elements than she eventually develops, hence we are left wondering how Natalie could ever have been a friend and whatever happened to the lost sketch studies.  (Under my pen, Lara's parents would have given her Sadie's desk in gratitude for all her sleuth-work, Lara would have given the desk pride of place in her new office and, upon opening a secret drawer, would have discovered the lost sketches.)  Finally, cremating the treasured necklace was an unsatisfying and bizarre conclusion for a prop that had further plot potential; with very little re-writing, Kinsella could have given the necklace a more triumphant ending, perhaps as Sadie's loving gift to Lara, or as Lara's gift to the gallery to be displayed next to the portrait.  A good editor would have recognized all these little weaknesses and could have intercepted.  As it is, the book reads more like a first draft than a finished product. Has Kinsella reached such a position of power over her publisher that she can refuse an edit?  If so, she is foolish.
0895260131|1.0|Robert Spencer is clearly against everything Islamic.  You can look up his earlier books and websites where his fellow follower are calling for the killing of Muslims and desecration and abolition of the Holy Quran.  If you are looking for the real and balance view on Islam, you won't find it here.  He's cherry-picking random versers from the Quran to prove his point.  Using his methods you could make mother Mother Teresa like an agent of the devil.  Trying to portray the crusaders as peaceful and purely defensive force is absurd especially since even Christian historians speak of their unspeakable crimes.  The only reason this book was written is to incite hatred and to prevent any dialog between the faiths.

0920668372|2.0|My parents got this book for us when we had our first child.  Honestly, the first half isn't all that bad, but when the son becomes a teenager, it begins to get a little strange.  Understand this, my son is three, and I hold him and tell him I love him at least once a day.  However, do I plan to drive across town when he has his own house, climb into his window, and hold him while he's sleeping?  NO!  What in the world!    Obviously there are lots of opposing views for this book, but I would encourage anyone considering this book, to find a store and read it in its entirety before purchasing.    If possible, I personally would have given the first half of the book 3 stars, and the second half 0 stars.  Unfortunately it's not possible, and being that it's not the worst book I've ever read, I settled for two stars.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I've been watching the regular DVD of P&P for years. When I first watched the Blu-Ray version, I was glued to it. Every scene is clear, not muddy. You can see the details in the dresses and, more importantly, Darcy in his wet shirt pops right off the screen!  ;o)
B002NXSRX4|4.0|This movie had a bit of a rough start for me. Before all the action starts we get Channing Tatum talking which is really painful. He's tolerable when there is action going on but without that it really exposes just how terrible of an actor he is. And since he's the star of the movie, he becomes a drag. I found just about every other character far more interesting than him. Even the ninja that doesn't speak.<br />The special effects are fun but a little cartoonish. I bought them sometimes. Other times they looked a little poor. But they got the job done.<br />If they make a sequel, I would suggest dumping Channing Tatum.

B002KDUDG6|1.0|Sad to say this album is a HUGE disappointment.  I know Michael's been touring a lot, but I'm shocked that in nearly three years David Foster and others couldn't put together an album of more than two original songs; or at least pick songs to cover with arrangements more similar to \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"Home.\\"  Unbelievable.    \\"Haven't Met You Met\\" is good, as are a few of the Bonus songs, but that's it.    In these financially strapped times, I feel like I threw $14.99 down the drain.   Again, truly unbelievable they didn't just follow the sound of Buble's \\"This Time.\\"
0060751967|5.0|The story is by far, the most hilarious romance novel I have read, in fact I often read it in public and managed to laugh out loud and embarrass myself.  The characters were perfect and the story line was really unique.  I especially loved how for ONCE the heroine is depicted to be a normal sized woman who is generally not in the need of a man to make her feel better about herself.  Roman (the Vampire stud) is simply the cutest character of all, and for just a little while you can pretend that chivalry isn't dead and that perhaps a man out there (vampire or not) could make you laugh, cry, and buy you brownies!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Amazon.com is great enough as it is.  But where else could you find BluRay movies for $9.99 especially when it just came out.  Item came in fast.  This is a must for Disney collectors.  I am about to order Monsters Inc and UP for $30.  Have fun and keep shopping.
0439023491|5.0|Before you start reading this review - DO NOT continue reading if you have not read The Hunger Games. Actually, stop what you're doing this instant and go get yourself a copy and read it! =D<br /><br />Catching Fire commences shortly after The Hunger Games ends. Katniss and Peeta are victorious in the Hunger Games and have now returned home. They should feel safe and warm in their post-Hunger Games lives, for now they have new homes, plenty of food, and are popular in all the Divisions - they are living lives that they could never even dream of. But not all is well in paradise. For Katniss' little act of defiance in the arena has incurred the wrath of the capitol. President Snow believes that the Divisions are taking Katniss' lead and are ready for an uprising.<br /><br />Leaving them no other choice, or risk the lives of their family and friends, it is now up to Katniss and Peeta to help dissuade the rebellious districts by making them believe that her actions were not defiant, but that of a lovestruck girl. But as they set out on their victory tour, they immediately start seeing the changes throughout the Divisions of Panem. She also notices that her mockingjay pin has become the symbol of the resistance. With the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games and a rebellion on the brink - the Capitol is angry and will stop at nothing short of revenge.<br /><br />WOAH! I have never before read a book that I found amazing and then picked up the sequel and been blown away by its awesomeness again! That is what happened to me with Catching Fire.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are back... with even more danger, more fear, more longing, more romance, yes, more everything. This book is a thrill ride - full of twists and turns that had me saying, \\"Oh, no she didn't!\\", more than once. Katniss continues being the rebellious, strong girl we have come to know and love. Peeta, as always, is back with his romantic notions and his willingness to give away everything, even his life, for Katniss. (Team Peeta!) In this one Gale, Katniss' BFF, is also back full force - and we do start noticing a love triangle in the works. But Katniss is not looking for a suitor or a husband - she just wants to survive and keep her loved one's safe.<br /><br />A word of caution, it does start slow, but it quickly picks up and will not let you go 'till you are done with it. And when you are done, you won't be able to believe it, because yes, there is a cliffhanger. But have no fear, third and final book in the trilogy seems to be in the works and is rumored to be released September 2010. So we'll all have to sit tight until then.<br /><br />The tension is thick - the action is packed - and I guarantee your heart will pound as you are once again thrown into Katniss' world.

0740785508|5.0|Imaginative Realism by James Gurney is the kind of book you can skip the words and just look at the pictures. Amazing art, truly amazing art, very inspiring. All the same, you will get a lot more value from the book if you actually read the text. This book assumes that you already can draw realistically. The writing is clear and charming.  As with most art technique books it has a chapter on materials and a chapter on how the studio is set up. Gurney has a long mirror on vertical hinges so he can swing it out for various views.  He also has an outdoor \\"gallery flambeau\\" that he and his son invented.  It's a magnifying glass, curved mirror and a stand for holding paper.  He uses it to destroy the artwork he does not want to keep.   The amount of preparation he does for each illustration is impressive. Gurney makes plastic clay models of his main characters so that he can be very consistent in his renderings. He also uses toys of animals. He puts together quick models of buildings and street scenes. These he uses to study lighting.  He and his friends dress up in costumes so that he can make accurate drawings.  He works a little from photographs of these attires.   Gurney shares his techniques and gives excellent advice on career directions.   If you are serious about realistic fantasy art, this is an excellent reference and inspiration.  Six stars, no sweat.
B0026BWT1Y|5.0|When I lost my two daughters in a tragic drowning accident in 2003, I was desperate to find some source of hope and comfort. The two greatest sources I found were Compassionate Friends (a support group for parents who have lost children,) and this book. While the author is very clearly a Christian, I fall somewhere in between Islam and Christianity and the things she said seemed to fit my beliefs perfectly.<br /><br />I was struggling with not being able to picture where my girls were or what they were doing, so I found myself reading every account of near-death experiences I could get my hands on. This was the most beautifully detailed experience I found, and I loved the images the author provided for me of what my girls might be seeing and experiencing. I did question at times whether the author could have really seen and remembered as much as she described, or whether she might be elaborating a little or a lot, but in the end, it didn't matter. Her book provided a description of heaven that comforted and sustained me at a very difficult time, and I reorder this book time and time again after passing my copy on to those suffering a loss of their own.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|I did something with Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC) that I rarely do: I purchased the complete show on DVD without so much as watching a single episode during its run on broadcast television or reading even one review.  The reason for such a brash move? Well I've always enjoyed the franchise in its feature film form and figured that the weekly format would be a spectacular medium in which to fill in the gaps between the films.<br /><br />As such TSCC does just that.  In fact the series could be viewed as Terminator 2.5 if the motion-picture timeline is one's gauge of measurement.  If you'll recall, Terminator 2: Judgment Day ended with Sarah Connor, her young son John (with the help of the 800 \\"Swartz\\" Series Terminator) manage to destroy both the liquid-metal T-1000, as well as the arm and chip from the first film's 800 Series Terminator.  The film was set in the year 1995 with a then ten-year-old John Connor.<br /><br />Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines jumped ahead to 2004 where a nineteen-year-old John Connor is living \\"off the grid\\" in the areas surrounding Los Angeles after the death of his mother.  It turns out that Judgment Day did not occur in 1997 as had been predicted in the first film due to mankind's intervention to the timeline, which postponed the prophesied events.  As is the robots of the future's way, another Terminator has been sent back in time (this time the female T-X unit) in effort to pick off Connor's future lieutenants in the human Resistance.<br /><br />TSCC begins in 1999 with a fourteen-year-old John Connor still living with his mother on constant run from both destiny and evil cyborgs. Following the movie-formula, the duo finds themselves pursued by a T-888 Terminator unit but aided by Cameron, a female (800 Series) Terminator that has been re-programmed and sent back through time to protect John.<br /><br />But before you go and get used to life circa 1999, the crew make a desperate escape by time traveling to the year 2007 and in the process jump right over the time where cancer should have claimed the life of Sarah Connor.  The Terminator in pursuit in 1999 uses the eight years of their absence to reconstruct his damaged chassis and is quite alive and well by the time 2007 rolls around.<br /><br />It gets worse still for our protagonists once they discover that that Skynet has in fact sent many Terminators back to the year 2007 for a whole variety of missions ranging from the execution of key resistance members to the physical construction of the network and facilities that will eventually become Skynet.<br /><br />The bottom line is, and like the movies, our heroes have their hands full in what boils down to present day in effort to change future-history.  The good news is, as an hour-long episode format, it works.  The shows build with absolutely beautiful pacing, intense action sequences, and solid scientific explanations without tech overload.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect going in; after all, many of the films demanded an R rating to tell their tale not to mention boasted budgets that put even the ritziest television budgets to shame.  I can state with confidence that producer Josh Friedman recognized these limitations and went about crafting the source material into a television effort with style and grace.<br /><br />The acting is well above what's typically associated with made-for-television action drama efforts and the effects, while slightly pale compared to the efforts of the last two feature films, are easily on par with (and at times surpass) the visuals of the first two.<br /><br />More impressive than the acting and visuals however would have to be the story/ plot structure itself which manages to take many of the elements that have made the films so enduring, and interweaves them with a slightly more dramatic feel than that of the movies (which were typically mass-destruction chases).<br /><br />My only complaint lies not with the show in particular but rather some of the typical snafus and paradoxes that the series (and time travel in general) call to mind.  Questions of predestination and multiple (parallel) existences can detract from an already difficult-to-follow timeline if the viewer allows themselves the distraction of pondering such things.  As has been the case with all of the Terminator incarnations thus far, it is best perhaps to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy the ride.<br /><br />The show was one of those that suffered due to the writer's strike and hence consists of only 9-episodes for the first season.  Coming in at a total runtime of 394 minutes, the show spans 3-discs and contains a healthy dose of extras including staff commentaries over three episodes, audition clips, gag reels, and several deleted \\"Terminated\\" scenes. The second season was boosted to 22-episodes before ultimately meeting its untimely demise from television.  A shame really, as the show managed to surpass most of my expectations.  I'm working on the second season now and will review that one upon completion as well.avel in general) call to mind.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This was my 3rd purchase of a bluray & now 100 later is still may favorite & when I had family & friends over that have never seen HD let alone Bluray they were shocked & breathless after watching this wonderful series!  average comments where wow,it's like your there,wow,OMG etc,etc    But even my little ones age 2,5,6 will drop what they are doing & sit right down on the floor about 5 ft from the TV & sit there for hours asking questions & spending good time with some education to boot!    This series did cost me more money in the end because even my kids noticed the better picture & so they started asking for their favorites in Bluray.    But I have watched it on Directv Hd & Bluray and all I can say is Buy It! Much better on Disc & looks alot better!
B002NXSRX4|3.0|This movie was OK to me.  But if ask my daughter...she will say its AWESOME!!    On Bluray...I didn't think it was any better than an upcoverted DVD.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|In my opinion, this is the finest of the three Transatlantic albums. The music is diverse and I believe has the most modern edge of their discography. I fell in love with the album upon my first listen, which is rare for me. It usually takes several listens with any album I buy before the music really sinks in. I can't give high enough marks for the compositions and the musicianship as well as the vocals. Whirlwind is definitely worth adding to your library.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I'm just a regular 43 year old mom. I'm not much of a reader, busy trying to keep work and family going. I read this book on my Kindle (I have read more books since getting the Kindle than I have in my life.) The best thing I can say about the book is that through the stories, the author allow you to come to your own conclusion. That was the best for me.    I loved the chapter titles. I know that may be silly but they always made me think and got me interested from the beginning. There were funny things like \\"dressed in black in the middle of the night\\" that were so funny and kept things light. My favorites were Bill and Nicolette, and the cow licking the worker's face.     I wish I could remember when it was that while reading the book I realized that I would never eat again. I knew the suffering that animals went through but choose not to think about it, but I never had realized how eating something that suffered so much bothered me. I know that the poultry industry bothered me the most because it's what I thought the least about before reading the book. The medical reasons, all of the drugs that could be in my kid's bodies. I think the environmental reasons were most surprising. The amount of water it takes to raise these animals and the amount of waste they put out. How our air and water is polluted.      Since there is no health reason to eat meat I can't imagine any other arguement that a person can have with themselves to keep them eating meat. I had always joked that I \\"lived to eat\\" and now I can truly say I will enjoy eating to live from now on.     I am so glad that the author wrote the book and so glad that I read it. I hope you read it.
0743435729|3.0|Grayson, a patriarchal sexually discriminating cultural backwater, discovered only 200 years ago by their neighbors, is a christian world. A biblical world, whose doctrines have led to polygamy and women having no rank or political rights. Honor Harrington arrives with the diplomatic mission of The Royal Manticoran Navy to make them an ally, a buffer, against the People's Republic -- The peeps. But Grayson has its own civil war emerging with the citizens of Masada; a near planet where long ago banished fanatics plot to blow up the entire planet of Grayson to God's glory. In secrecy the Peeps have armored the Masada with a superior battleruiser which more than doubles everything the Royal Navy brought with them. Things start to escalate and enemy is sneaking everywhere. How will Harrington succeed to orchestrate the defence of the Grayson when their admirals won't even consider women worth shaking hands?    The strategic alliance part of the story starts nicely and the cultural clash with the Grayson, while quite stereotypical and non-creative, is nicely told. The problems with dealing with feminine authority are nuanced with the diplomat characters and in Grayson military. Harrington struggling to deal with her emotions are reflected in conversations with her officers. The female lead, the likable heroine, suffers somewhat from certain stiffness and predictability, loosing control in contrast to intelligent responses. She is black and white and with Nimitz (Harrington's telepathic treecat) they can singlehandedly take out a crew of assassins. The scenes in space offer lot of technical details, show engaging naval battle tactics and tight maneuvering.    Three (3) stars. Written in 1993 this is the 2nd book in Weber's Honorverse. Almost surprisingly the best part of the book is the first third where the diplomatic issues are being scened and fleshed out in tingling conversations. The build of suspense starts leveling at 2/3 of the book when Harrington is unleashed todo her honor to the Queen to fight against overpowered adversary. Luckily the bad guys are a little more varied than what one might expect, some even decent. But very little more is revealed from the Peeps or the Masadans. The overwhelming glory that awaits for Harrington at the end is understandable from a sequel point of view but for this book, the ending is too tidy, too glorious. An undeniable embodiment of military science fiction, but a little too much sugar on a cake.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|The stuckup teen pop star finds that she needs to grow up and stop the Lindsey Lohan self-destructive behavior.  She meets the challenge well and finds that adulthood requires truth.  A very good coming of age comedic-drama.  Worth owning for the movie part ... without the singing.  Acting is much better than the tv show.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|If you like romantic comedy you will like this movie, a little slow on the begining then you won't stop laughing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD.  It is easy to follow and totally effective.  I have done level 1 about 7 times and I have lost 2 lbs.  I can also feel the difference in my muscles.  In very little time, I feel like I've made huge fitness gains.  Jillian rocks!  She will work you, but you will feel the burn.  I had trouble walking the first week because I used my muscles in a totally different way.  Months on the treadmill didn't even touch how effective this dvd is.  Highly recommended.  (It is actually currently on channel 1067 if you have digital cable if you want to try it out first.)
1573300403|5.0|Love it - so much that I came back to amazon to order another as a christmas gift and ordered a diffrent one in the series for my self. I love Mike.
0783225849|5.0|Although we can see this movie just about any Halloween season, I decided to buy it for our collection.  This movie was groundbreaking in its time.  It's odd that we know everything that's going to happen but it still gives me the shivers.  Everything came together in \\"Psycho.\\"  An original script; terrific acting;  music that is as essential to the fright scenes as the script; and an ending that you never see coming.  Of course if you've seen the movie once, you know how it ends.  But in the 50's none of this was ever done, especially by actors of Janet Leigh's status.      After all these years, I still find it chilling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book i have read in a while.i couldnt put this down!love it!very creative and a well written. its now one of my favorite books and ive read well over 200 books in the past 3 years.cant wait to read the second!a must read for young adults
1934030198|5.0|This is a great book for anyone wanting to get serious with triathlons or multisport events. Very comprehensive and references the latest scientific research and links this to practical training advice. Very fact based.
0439023491|5.0|I waited and waited, wondering what would happen in District 12 after The Hunger Games. Finally, the day had come and I got to bring home my bright, beautiful book. Would it be worth the wait?<br /><br />Absoutly! It was amazing...incredible!! Suzanne Collins definitely didn't let me down with Catching Fire. This book was everything I was hoping for and more. I bought it the day after it was released--knowing that I could devote 2 full days to reading/savoring it. I set it down only to eat, sleep, watch a movie with my husband, and get a haircut. I thought those momentary breaks would drive me crazy with anticipation--and they did--but I was surprisingly appreciative of them because they allowed me to stop and think about what I had read for a moment before I found out how the book ended. The thing that is driving me crazy is the cliffhanger, even though I knew it was coming.<br /><br />This book completely captivated me. I am surprised that when I think about the book, I am not thinking about the ending and how I think the third book with turn out, I'm thinking about the middle pieces of the story that captivated me. (Okay, maybe I'm thinking about the end a little) But I was sitting, getting my haircut and all the women around me were talking about the most recent gossip in the magazines (gossip I hate to admit I would usually jump right into) but at that moment it didn't seem real to me. In that moment, the memories of the book felt more real than the Hollywood drama. It was then that I realized how much the book had brought me into its story and I was okay with stopping for a few hours to get my haircut because I was still living the story in my mind and working out all the details. Isn't that how it is supposed to be?<br /><br />I can't wait to see how it ends.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I am just wondering when all the whiny morons here are going to realise that Superman did NOT turn back time again in this movie. As a matter of fact, it was for THIS movie that the time reversal sequence was meant for!!! Stop your God-awful whining!!!<br /><br />Secondly, this movie was NOT supposed to be a sequel but the second part of one movie! Donner had everything penned and planned perfectly; unfortunately, Alexander and Ilya Salkunt decided to make a mockery out of an American icon so they fired Donner, cut Brando and RUINED EVERYTHING!!!<br /><br />Also, Marlon - El is still alive and The Fortress Of Solitude was NOT destroyed! Yes, Marlon - El gave his life to repower his son and Superman melted The Fortress with his heat vision; however, since he reversed time and sent Zod and company back to The Phantom Zone, that means all of the other events DID NOT HAPPEN!!! Lois did not sleep with Superman, Luthor is back in prison and... MARLON - EL AND THE FORTRESS ARE STILL THERE!!!<br /><br />Let us hope that one day all of our dreams will be realised and Selutron can release the real version of \\"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\\"; until then, this is the TRUE version of \\"Superman II\\"!!! To Hell with Lester's Cut!!!
0679731725|3.0|I am not English, and I enjoyed this novel to learn such polite English. Rather entertainig.    By the way, great delivery service by Amazon. Very fast.
0061537969|5.0|Almost no one seems to recognize that this book is a fiction version of Eckart Tolle's \\"Power of Now\\", the Tolle of \\"A New Earth\\" featured so prominently on Oprah. This great story is a meditation, as it were, on mindfulness. It is all there: intention, attention, all is one, consciousness, getting to the silence that lies  beneath the 50,000 thoughts we think every day (I think it is Deepak Chopra who gave that number), even reincarnation.  In addition to being a great read, it is essentially the spiritual journey of a man and father. I was pleasantly surprised to find the racing content fascinating, although the racing was a kind of meditation for the main character. Loved it.
B001AQO46E|5.0|No Blu-Ray for this one?  OMG....What I wouldn't give to see JLC's dance scene on my new 50\\" plasma.  I'm tellin' ya, my wife would never walk the same again.  Step up and put one together for us!!!
B001UUY3A2|5.0|It seems the director Yip Wai Shun is almost single-handedly resurrecting Chinese martial arts cinema and key to his success is his use of actual martial artists for whom he seems to have a healthy measure of respect.  Three such artists are Jacky Wu, Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen.  Sammo here does the action direction/ choreography and he knows what he's doing just as he knows his Wing Chun.  Yip Wai Shun knows how to tell a story and keeps the cinematography crisp and clear without making of it the trickster that's suppose to wow fans but only illustrates how ridiculous martial arts movies can get.  Shun also relies on the tireless natural acting talent of Simon Yam.  But the great success here, in my view, is in the seemingly ageless Donnie Yen.  Every long time Hong Kong action fan knows Donnie Yen unfairly overflows with natural talent and a work ethic few are inclined to emulate.  But for some reason, movie makers seem not to have known or cared and unlike Jackie Chan and Jet Li who still managed to get it right now and then, Donnie's movies just weren't cutting it.  Maybe the experience was good for him though because of late Yen's movies have been excellent and, given the sad shape of Hong Kong action flicks for too long now, transcendent.  Ip Man is a great movie and if you're a Donnie Yen admirer, it's greater still.  His acting is subtle, flawlessly dignified and (as action movies should be) inspiring.  This movie will probably always be listed among the top ten martial arts flicks of all time for more reasons than one needs to list but for no reason more critical than Donnie Yen's performance.  Just watch it, as you know you will, over and over again and, as they say, \\"Enjoy.\\"
B001HN697M|5.0|THIS WAS A GOOD HORROR MOVIE, FILLED WITH BETRAYAL, ROMANCE, AND REVENGE.  THE CAST WAS EXCELLENT.  MICHAEL SHEEN WAS AWESOME!!!  BILL NIGHY'S CHARACTER WAS DEEP AND WICKEN.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|awesome DVD! Very addicting series... One of the best shows on television!  Amazon offers good pricing as well as fast delivery.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version of Persuasion is the best I have ever seen.  The acting is superb, the music is beautiful and the scenery is great.  I love it and would recommend this to anyone who loves Jane Austen!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I had never watched Lonesome Dove. I have heard about it many times but never had any interest in watching it. My step father watched this movie 2 to 3 times a week on an old tape he had made. I didn't understand the desire. I recently helped them upgrade their video equipment. I then ordered the movie and before I gave it to him, I watched it. I was memorized and I didn't want to wait until the next day to finish it. Now I am planning on watching it again and very soon. It takes a hold of you never lets you go. There are not many movies out there that can say that!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I am a huge Queens fan. I wasn't too sure of this album when it first came out, but upon listening to it again, I gotta say this is one of their best and the framework for a lot of the themes that come later on their albums. This is the second time I've purchased the CD and I think this time is better. Might be age, might be I'm in a different place, but this is an amazing album.     The store was brilliant and I will definitely buy from them again. I loved how quickly it came... and how appreciative they were about my purchase. It's great to have good customer service.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Especially the one about \\"old-man emo\\".  That was pretty funny.  I'm an \\"old man\\" that has just recently discovered Muse (after hearing \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" on Guitar Hero when it first came out) and finding a lot to enjoy here.  Part of the reason that Muse gets a bad rap is because 1. they sound so much like Queen and U2 (listen to \\"Map of the Problematique\\" again if you don't agree with the U2 reference), and 2. most of their stuff never makes it onto radio, at least not enough for DJ's to tell listeners who they are.  This is a crying shame.  Back in my day, we had \\"emo\\" too, except we called it \\"glam\\", and the artists were considered ground-breaking.  It's too bad that we have degenerated into a society where we don't appreciate songs on the basis of whether or not we actually enjoy them - we have to analyze the details of their construction and bash every artist who emulates one of their glam-heyday heroes.<br /><br />So is Resistance Muse's way of getting onto the radio?  There's nothing wrong with this Muse CD - it might even be my favorite one by them if I had never heard Black Hole and Revelations - but it certainly represents a shift in how they view themselves and how they want the public to view them.  This is a step in the direction of being less serious, and being more fun, in my opinion.  My advice for the first-time listener is to embrace Black Holes, give this CD a shot if you decide you like what you hear there, and not dig too deep on The Resistance, since Muse will be what they want to be, and we (as listeners) should appreciate them for what they create.  Long time listeners will want to read Chris Billings' review (above) for track info and comments, although I would have to say I place this CD just slightly ahead of Absolution for listen-ability.
0810983915|5.0|I purchased this book for my son and he read it in one go. He has the whole series of these books and loves them. We can't wait for the next one!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|There's so much going on in the food industry that it would take a series of films to properly expose it all. This film is only 90 minutes, so there isn't time to cover it all. But for what it is, this is a very well made and gripping look into the corruption that we all don't fully realize exists. Even if you are someone who doesn't care about the way you eat, this film will make you look at things differently. It will hold your attention and disgust you with the truths it presents. Everyone owes it to themselves to see this.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire exceeded even my high expectations for how good it would be. As many of my questions were answered, dozens more were sparked by the very exciting ending of the book. Suzanne Collins really knows how to bring her characters to life and make you love or hate them depending on who they are and what they do. I can barely wait to see whats going to happen now that everything has come crashing down.
B002MRROKS|5.0|Unlike the CD this has it all. I was blown away by the sound and what an awesome show. It makes me realize how bad most of today's artists are.( For that type of music) Things really have changed. It became cool to sellout and everybodys does it nowadays.
0061864153|5.0|This purchase is a MUST MUST for any lover of rock n roll, epecially a Bon Jovi fan!  Marvelous book, great insight and a total inside glance at the greatest band in the Universe
B00284BMBM|1.0|This isn't a 1 star album, but it's not 5 either. So to offset these ridiculous reviews I gave it 1 star. For those of you that think this is 5 stars you were probably born in the 90's and don't know any better. No, I'm not a babyboomer either. Just a little older then you. We now live in a world where it is cool to sellout, be as commercial as possible. While I do think Cris Daughtry is talented, I just don't think this album is close to 5 stars. Everybody now wants to be famous, rich, successful. Thats all we care about now. Lets be in Nissan commercials and do whatever it takes. That's not a direct stab at Daughtry by the way. We are products of the time we live in so it's not your fault either.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|It was not original factory sealed DVD from US. the package was shipped from China, the pictures on the discs were distoreded, and DVDs didn't work on the laptop, some of them worked on the regular player, can see the scratch marks on most of them. Refund was prompt but the return postage that was promised to be sent via a check was not received to this date. Disappointed since this was very first time ordering on-line.
B002MRROKI|5.0|5 stars for the music, but my only problem with this is that it should have been two discs showing the complete show like the dvd. Not sure why they didn't do that. The sound quality is much better then when I had my bootleg copy of the show years back. But, it's missing 1 song and all the band chatter.
1594488878|1.0|What is wrong with you people?  Stop drinking the kool-aid.....Yes, he is a great author - but come on, just because he has written some good books in the past doesn't mean that we have to kiss his butt for this turd of a book.  I have read all of Hornby's stuff and will probably give him the benefit of the doubt and read his next book too, but don't make this one to be anything special.....
B0029O08WA|3.0|Soundtracks are obsolete nowadays. You can choose on the internet whichever song you want instead of buying the album. Not the case a few years ago. That being said it's really unnecessary this album. The songs I love are Deatch Cab for Cutie, Thom Yorke, and a few of the newer bands.
B000BISBDY|3.0|Johnny Cash is a legend; however, I enjoy the singing voice of Joaqin Phoenix in  \\"Walk the Line\\" more.  Call me crazy.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|From Elvis in Memphis is Elvis Presley at his very greatest/highest level singing as a performer coming off the 68 comeback special, vibrant and full of pure intense energy, belting out soulful tunes with the outright highest level of performance, which was only attainable by the king of rock n roll Elvis Presley. Elvis stole songs from the greatest that's what made him the king of all music he could sing anything and everything and make music beyond special. Music is not just about the notes its about the personality and character of the individual people like tom jones and Wayne Newton did not have the depth, and energy in the performances that Elvis made popular from 1969 through 1977. With that being said \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" is a classic album from beginning to end. To get a better understanding of the dedicated work ethic Elvis Presley had on this record [...] and check out the alternative versions of such classic's as \\"Wearin' That Loved On Look\\", \\"Only The Strong Survive\\", \\"True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\\", and \\"Anyday Now\\". They have multiple takes of these songs on YouTube which are very interesting to listen to especially for a greater understanding of the songs. Let's not forget the incredible musicians either that played with Elvis on this record and the famous producer. They were a truly unique dedicated team that made hit records in Memphis were this album was recorded. Highly Recommended!!!
B0024FAG62|4.0|This is a favorite movie. Lots of fun. From the opening gun battle on. If you like old fashion westerns, you will like this. The Blue Ray version is well done and shows the scenary very well. The sound also benefits.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|This is probably the best rock/pop-/jazz concert I have ever seen.  Not only is Stevie Wonder great, but all the musicians are absolutely top-flight.  His daughter Aisha Morris (for whom the song \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" was written) does a solo vocal number that is sweet and sensitive, and the other backup singers are fanastic as well.  I would recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoys Stevie Wonder or this type of music.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This film was eye opening.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!! We all need to become more aware of our flawed health care system and what health insurance and pharmaceutical companies are capable of.  This is the only way we can make more informed choices and create CHANGE.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I had ordered this DVD along with the new Joe Bonamassa DVD at Royal Albert Hall May '09 at the same time.  I tend to like more blues based music whatever genre (hence the Bonamassa DVD) and have always thought Steve Vai to be one of the creme de la creme guitar player / musician / creator's out there.  For me I was never really into shred type guitar playing, but this is a whole different level.  I have known about Steve Vai since his Frank Zappa days but have never had any recordings of his in my own collection except for the Clapton Crossroads concert and watching him in the movie Crossroads guitar showdown with that kid playing the Telecaster.  So that makes me a nubie so to speak.  I play guitar and have read many articles about Vai and his gear etc. over the past 20+ years or so.  Previous post summarized maybe heavy metal Grateful Dead?  I am thinking more on the lines of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu on steroids.  Whatever, it doesn't really matter.  Blah blah blah, I am running on here.    Well this DVD shows just how talented this guy is from this concert date from 2 years ago.  Anyone who knows about Steve Vai has always known how talented he is and what he can bring.  The band members are absolutely amazingly talented with their own energy that they bring and would think Vai would have nothing less since he is the main guy.  I did not know that Steve sings and was kind of surprised at his decent vocal quality.    Already having stated his talent, Mr. Vai is really a great showmen with his humor and antics while playing which makes this DVD all the more fun and jaw dropping with mind boggling musical arrangements. I just love the two violins of Alex Depue and Ann Marie Calhoun that compliment so well.  Jeremy Colson the drummer is tireless and will totally blew you away.  This young man's energy is a force to be reckoned with.  Bryan Beller with his 5 string bass is so good along with second guitarist Dave Weiner playing a 7 string guitar which really addsthat additional bottom chunk and gets to be spot lighted on his own.  Second guitarist is an oxymoron.  This guy is great!  Play this DVD or Blue-Ray, whatever you got loud.  Seeing is believing what musical human beings are capable of.  WOW!
0143034901|4.0|Product as advertised...surprised that shipping from GA to GA resident took as long as shipping cross country.
B002PTHKNY|5.0|This is how bands should make and sell cd's.  This is the version which comes with download codes to get two complete PJ shows (like an additional 60 some songs!!!!!)        First the Backspacer album itself.  Incredible.  Production and songs are amazing.  The first two songs have a more hardcore edge.  Fixer opens up into an amazing anthem sound.  Poetic lyrics, amazing singing, hard rocking guitars, excellent drumming and bass.  This is the best band of the last twenty years, and this album proved it to me.  This album is a MUST listen to.  The entire album as a whole flows great together.  Especially from Just Breathe to The End.  It is concise and tight, and not a moment is wasted.  Awesome.       Again, this is the version where you get to choose from 10 or 12 concerts and can download those COMPLETE concerts.  So for one price you get the album, and two complete shows.  This is a deal you cannot beat.  After hearing the live shows, I have been converted into a complete Pearl Jam maniac!!!!  Believe me, this album is and band is ALL THAT!!!!!
1597801577|5.0|Great writer, great book, with not a false note struck nor a piece of awkward dialogue. The book stands on its own as a great piece of writing.  But for those who think that sci fi portrays worlds far into the future, think again: the world of The Windup Girl may be right around the corner as we willfully ignore the potential and probable effects of climate change.
B001MS7O8A|2.0|There's that pride of ownership, a prized collectible, that's why so many of us hunt down these rare limited editions and add them to our collection. It's fun, you've got that special little 'no one I know has this' prize going.<br /><br />So when I heard about this, I jumped on the idea, until... Plant part of it? Gee, why not just, I donno, rip up money and use it as mulch? Well, surely there's something extra on the CD, but no, it's a poster and an envelope for an extra $30, or $10 if you got it during Amazon's special sale.<br /><br />What a letdown.  Still a good album - if you don't have this one, get it, plant the envelope and, well, don't know what you're doing with the poster - maybe recycling it into a greeting card for your grandmothers?  Hey, that's $5 there at least, so it's starting to turn into a bargain... Just don't get annoyed that the Best Buy edition has five more tracks, or the new UK Deluxe edition's got seven more.<br /><br />Thanks, but, well, no thanks.

B00063F8B2|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas stories and the movie is great so I had to have the soundtrack. I had it before but it got misplaced in one of my moves in the last couple of years and I was totally bummed last year not having it, so I HAD to replace it. I was so glad when I found it on here for a reasonable price, used. It came in great condition and quickly!
B001GSV3EC|3.0|This doesn't have some of the vocals by guest artists as does the DVD.  Pity.  Blanket by Imogen Heep is the one of the reasons I purchased it.
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|1.  I watched this film in the theaters and recently got the DVD.<br /><br />2.  If expect similar stuff from the prior two Ice Age films, then you won't be disappointed with this one (which isn't a bad thing and actually a very smart move on the part of those who created Ice Age).  It's a solid animated film with a nice story line;  a definite must for most kids and their parents.
0786868724|5.0|I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS BOOK. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK I WOULD REFLECT ON THE HATRED WITHIN RELIGIONS FOR OTHERS. BEING BROUGHT UP CATHOLIC AND HAVING A PARENT THAT IS NOW A SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN GOING TO A BAPTIST CHURCH THAT TEACHES SO MUCH HOW WRONG OTHER RELIGIONS ARE IT HAS CONFIRMED MY THOUGHTS OF EVERYONE JUST GETTING ALONG. I PLAN ON PURCHASING THE BOOK FOR THIS PARENT FOR CHRISTMAS. MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT SHE REACHES SOME OF THE FEELINGS I RECEIVED FROM THE READ...GOD ONLY WANTS FOR US TO BE GOOD HUMAN BEINGS TO EACH OTHER, WHETHER HE'S CALLED BY \\"GOD\\" OR WHATEVER YOUR RELIGION CHOOSES. IF THIS WERE SEEN AS THE SOLE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION, THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT ALL THAT READ IT TRY TO PRACTICE WHAT IT TAUGHT ME. BE KIND TO OTHERS AND RESPECT THEM FOR THE GOOD THEY PRODUCE FROM THEIR FAITH.
0394873742|5.0|This book is exciting because it is big; the illustrations are delightful. It would make a striking decoration in a child's room and could be used by a young child, as well as an older one.
0385504225|2.0|\\"Character A: Have you heard of X?   Character B (usually Langdon): Yes, but I thought that was just a myth.   Character A shows or tells B something.   Character B reacts with shock.   Then, insert scenes of people walking from one place to another, being chased.   Then, insert the sentence \\"Suddenly everything made sense.\\" At least for the next ten pages.   Repeat. \\"    I liked this analogy.  One thing I would add though after \\"Character B reacts wtih shock\\"    --Character A smiles at everyone elses stupidity - as it's been under their nose the WHOLE time and makes perfect sense to HIM/HER.  --add a crapload of preaching (I LOVE religious books...I HATE preaching books).    You can do better Dan Brown....Don't be thinking about the movie when you write the book...think about the book.  Eternally self rightous cocky characters grate on my nerves.  If it wasn't a Dan Brown book...I wouldn't have finished it.
0070511136|5.0|I first learned about SPIN back in 1983 with my first job out of college.  I can tell you that I've used it religously since then to help me close millions of dollars of business that I wouldn't have closed without the knowledge that SPIN provides.  Rackham articulates exactly how you should frame your sales meetings so that you are asking the absolutely perfect questions that lead to expressed (explicit) needs that your customers want to solve with your help.   Without asking the right questions, (and in the right order), you will get more objections than necessary, and you will lose sales opportunities.  If you want to be a schlocky 'Herb Tarlick' type salesperson, then this isn't for you.  But if you want to impress your clients with your ability to create solutions that they love, then SPIN will definitely get you there.   Get the book, and also purchase the SPIN fieldbook.  Develop your own set of questions, and PRACTICE!  You will be glad you did!
0385504225|4.0|For starters, I really, really liked (95%) of this book. I couldn't read it fast enough (in a good way) and was reminded why Mr. Brown is an absolute joy to read. I read Da Vinci Code years ago, and more recently picked up Angels & Demons (stay FAR away from the movies please!!!!!!!!!) Loved A&D, and so I was excited to receive this book by surprise and enter into Mr. Brown's world. I was reminded why I love reading him so much, as he constantly had me up until 1:30am saying, \\"Ok the next chapter is just two pages, one more chapter\\" which I started saying at 12am... His writing is wonderful and I really enjoyed the rollercoaster ride through Washington, D.C. I was constantly trying to guess which side certain characters were on, and thought that his antagonist Mal'akh was brilliant.    Unfortunately (at least for me this is a bit of a negative) I could see the plot twist coming about halfway through the book as to Mal'akh's true identity and intentions...and maybe Mr. Brown wrote it that way (there is some allusion to this)...but for me this is a negative, albeit a forgivable one.    So, up until now I loved this book to death and enjoyed reading almost every second of it.    The negatives:    The conclusion seemed a bit of a letdown given that it took 480 hardcover pages to get there, which is quite a lot of reading! I thought the finale was a bit rushed, but again was able to forgive Mr. Brown this because he is a fantastic writer. However, I had to force myself to skim the last 20-30 pages, which was terribly unfortunate. After the conclusion of course there is the matter of wrapping up what the Lost Symbol is. I found this to be horribly boring and terribly preachy, as Mr. Brown knew he had his readers and it was akin to saying \\"I have you now, so let me ram my agenda in your face.) It wasn't religiously preachy, just...ideologically and theologically preachy...and BORING. No Mr. Brown I don't really care about your world view and about how everything is unitedas evidenced by your main character's diatribes in the end of the book. While I appreciated that this book stayed away from being religiously preachy...I just couldn't handle the last 20 or so pages. Utterly boring and unnecessary.    Mr. Brown, I loved your book, but if it were perhaps 20-30 pages shorter, I would have been much happier and felt less cheated - and also this was the ONLY time his agenda and viewpoints really shone through as people would expect.    So, in sum, loved the book, hated the last 20-30 pages of it. If you're ok with that, and you should be, it's a great read that I would recommend, just don't tell anyone that the ending kind of stinks.
B00297FEUS|3.0|Twisted Sister- \\"Stay Hungry\\" 25th Anniversary Edition<br /><br />Some things just won't go away and Dee Snider and Twisted Sister are two of them...with their  shock tactics a la Alice Cooper, makeup by Clown College, USA and MTV imagery and heavy rotation Twisted Sister will go down in history, however with their recent 25th anniversary edition, it appears they won't stay down. Surprisingly, it may not be such a bad thing. Who knew Long Island would be famous for a drink and infamous for a band.<br /><br />If you're looking for lyrical depth, musical prowess or life changing tunes..Twisted Sister isn't your bag, but then to their credit they never claimed to be. Perhaps there's a bit too much time capsule aspect in their \\"Stay Hungry\\" revisit but surprisingly, rock anthems like \\"Stay Hungry\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\" can still evoke a head bang or two despite the best attempts to prevent such approval.<br /><br />You will stay hungry because Twisted Sister does not meet the recommended daily adult requirements for rock and metal but isn't that kind of the point?<br /><br />- Kim Thore All Access Magazine
0307346617|4.0|The Zombie Wars have occurred and now the human race is recovering and Max Brooks is documenting this historical period through interviews with the survivors. For those familiar with Studs Terkel, you will appreciate Max's interview style to capture the voices of the people that were there.<br /><br />Brooks does a nice job in providing details which fire your imaginations in what-if scenarios and questions of curiousity. You will have moments during the reading when you will say to yourself, \\"...I didn't think about that...\\" or \\"...I would have...\\" Each of these responses says that you are brought into the story.<br /><br />My slight criticisms are that a couple of the narratives get a little long and the book's ending is a little weak. I accept the ending because, like most \\"history\\" books one does not usually have an emotional \\"wow\\" response.<br /><br />Overall, \\"World War Z\\" is an enjoyable read and I would recommend to everyone who wants to engage in today's fascination with Zombies, or if you want to know what your teenagers are reading.

And the most inspirational book I have ever read.
B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|When this album was released in 1969, people freaked.  The Doors used an orchestra and brass instruments on a lot of the songs.  Their third album (Waiting For The Sun) made people worried because it was viewed as too commercialized, as if the band was abandoning their darker side and selling out to the Top 40 crowd.  So when The Doors released their fourth studio album (The Soft Parade) it REALLY had people worried.  How could The Doors go from the darkness and mysteriousness of their first two albums to something like The Soft Parade?<br /><br />Time to review this unique and somewhat underrated album.<br /><br />The first song, Tell All The People, sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Brass and strings dominate throughout.  The classic song Touch Me follows, with the famous saxophone solo at the end of the song by Curtis Amy.  My favorite song on the album, Shaman's Blues, follows.  This song is vintage old Doors music.  No orchestra on this one.  Just plain bluesy/rock & roll Doors music.  The song Do It has Jim Morrison laughing in the beginning.  Very upbeat.  An average Doors song.  Not bad.  The song Easy Ride has sort of a polka type sound to it.  A real changeup.  The classic Wild Child is one of the great Doors songs of all time (\\"Do you remember when we were in Africa?\\").  The song Runnin' Blue is pretty much a bluegrass song.  A Sandy Koufax curveball if there ever was one.  Robbie Krieger AND Jim Morrison sing this song.  It begins with Morrison saying a poem that is a tribute to Otis Redding, who had recently died.  The song Wishful Sinful is a classic that has the orchestra's help.  This song is mellow and a little mysterious.  The title track follows, the last song on the original release of this album.  It clocks in at 8:40.  A happy song, yet terrifying at times.  Just when you start getting happy and comfortable, the atmosphere changes to classic Doors dread.  A great song.<br /><br />The rest of this CD has unreleased songs.  The song Who Scared You should have been included on the original release in 1969, in my opinion.  It's a very good song with the help of the orchestra.  It's interesting to hear the lyrics mixed with the orchestra.  Very unique.  This song was released on the 1972 \\"best of\\" album Weird Scenes Inside The Gold Mine, which I have.  Again, I don't know why this song didn't make it onto The Soft Parade.<br /><br />If you like The Doors and have avoided this album all along, I highly recommend it because The Doors were all about experimentation, and this album is a perfect example of that.  From the trailblazing radicalism and darkness of their first two albums, to the Top 40 sell-out albums, to the orchestra album, to a straight blues album (L.A. Woman), The Doors' music didn't all sound the same.  The Soft Parade's songs are so different from one another.  You get a little of everything on this album - rock & roll, blues, bluegrass, pop, you name it.  Buy this album.been included on the original release in 1969, in my opinion.

B0001932ZA|5.0|The Running Man (1987) is my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  Based on the novel by Stephen King, it is an action-packed futuristic thriller with suspense, drama, humor, and horror.  Combine these elements and you've got a movie that holds your attention.  In the year 2019 the world economy has collapsed and television is ruling the lives of the American people.  A top-rated game show called The Running Man rules the airwaves with its host Damon Killian (Richard Dawson from Family Feud).  The show lets convicts have a shot at receiving pardons for their crimes if they can defeat the \\"stalkers\\" of the game show who are out to kill them.  These stalkers are heavily armed with unique novelty weapons.  The stalkers are Subzero with his sharp hockey sticks and exploding pucks; Buzzsaw with his heavy duty chainsaw and motorcycle; Dynamo with his dose of lightning bolt electricity; and Fireball (Jim Brown) with his flame throwing gun.<br /><br />Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been wrongly convicted of what is known as The Bakersfield (California) Massacre.  He didn't shoot anybody.  He was framed.  He goes to prison and escapes with the help of some fellow inmates.  Richards gets tangled up with a young woman named Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso) soon afterward, and the two are at an airport supposedly going on a vacation.  Richards is accused of kidnapping her and he is captured a short time later.  It is then that he is offered the opportunity to receive a full pardon through The Running Man game show - if he can defeat Killian's stalkers on live TV.  Richards' two prison buddies are put on the game show to get chances at pardons.  Even Amber is put on the show (after the show made up lies about her to justify her appearance on the show).  Can these four contestants escape and defeat Killian's stalkers?<br /><br />Richards and his fellow contestants meander through the game zone, which is among the ruins of a 1997 earthquake in Los Angeles.  Richards takes on the stalkers and stuns the TV audience with his skills and prowess and kills three of the four.  The other one he let go because, as he put it, he was \\"a helpless human being.\\"  Soon the audience starts rooting for and betting on Richards instead of the stalkers.  Things get so humiliating for Killian that a retired stalker-turned-announcer, Captain Freedom (Jesse Ventura) is forced to come out of retirement to fight Ben Richards and Amber.  Captain Freedom doesn't want to come out of retirement, so they rig a computerized fake video that shows him killing Richards and Amber, even though both of them are alive and actually watching this fake \\"live\\" coverage on TV.  The ending of the movie has Richards giving Killian a taste of his own medicine, sending him on the same long ride into the game zone that he himself took at the top of the show.  That's the irony.<br /><br />Other people that appear in this movie are Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa.<br /><br />If you want to see a really good action movie, then see this movie.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I must say that the movie was wonderful. Nevertheless, my all-time favorite song, \\"Dirty Diana\\", was not included. THAT'S WHY I'M BUYING THIS DVD (and also because it's Michael) I've actually heard Ortega say that 2-3 hours of rehearsal footage would be on the DVD, in addition to the movie...so hopefully \\"Dirty Diana\\" is on there!! MJ actually rehearse it before he died and he made some particular comments about the aerialist and a bed (make your guess). Seriously, that song is amazing! AND the video, AND the live performances in 1988!! OMG!! OMG!! OMG!! OMG!!! can you imagine MJ, all mature and so sexy, rehearsing this heck of a song?????????? I think I would die!! It would be OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! too perfect for this mortal existence...that's why those concerts never happened- it would've been too much for the human race.

0385504225|1.0|Having read all of Dan Brown's previous books, I was expecting Lost Symbol to be action packed and full of twists and turns, perhaps not a block buster like the DaVinci Code, but at least interesting.  However, I wasn't expecting the kind of really hokey stuff that I encountered here.  For example, after a long build up of grisley murders related to the lost treasure and developing the idea that some fantastic surprise awaits, we finally get to the revelation that 'The Word,' which had to be protected at all costs, was nothing more than a bible buried beneath the Washington monument.       Then we are subjected to a long diatribe about how some incredible experiment by Katherine showed that thoughts have mass and can produce physical changes and that science has proven the existence of god.       The end result is not credible and hugely disappointing.  I didn't really expect Dan Brown to come up with something to best the DaVince Code, but I did expect a lot more than a tedious science fiction novel.
1439138311|5.0|I enjoyed this novel tremendously from beginning to end.  The characters drew me in, the writing is flawless, and I found plenty of plot in a young woman leaving her beloved family and immigrating to the U.S. on her own.  Although I have read many novels that have told that story, the accuracy and detail of Brooklyn tells the story in a completely new light.  Also, it covered a unique time period -- not a 19th century immigration story, and not a present day story either.  I will be on the lookout for Toibin's next novel, and in the meantime am crossing my fingers that I will find some fiction that half as good.

0786868724|5.0|Mitch is a sportswriter for the Detroit Free Press (and I remember him fondly from my growing up years in Detroit), who became well known nationally through his book [[ASIN:076790592X Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson]]. This is Albom's first non-fiction book since then, and it is fantastic.    The story begins with Mitch's childhood rabbi (aka \\"Reb\\") asking him to give the eulogy at his funeral. Mitch looks at Reb wondering if he is dying, but Reb tells him it's coming but not in the near future. Mitch accepts and begins meeting with Reb, this man of God he used to fear, on a regular basis as part of the agreement. Mitch wanted to get to know Reb as a human being. The book chronicles the 8 years Mitch travels from Detroit to New Jersey to meet with the rabbi, a wonderfully joyous man who sings all the time, (\\"How are you doing, Reb?\\" Singing \\"The old gray rabbi, ain't what he used to be....\\") and who has given his life's service to building a single community of faith.    The vignettes are marvelous, ranging from snippets from Reb's sermons throughout the years, to how the Reb handled inter-faith connections in his community, including a scene with the Roman Catholic priest from the church across the street. Just fabulous.    But intertwined with the Reb's story are the details of another man Mitch has gotten to know during this same time: an African-American pastor in the inner-city of Detroit who ministers to the homeless. Henry is a former drug dealer and addict who had a life changing experience with God, and now leads this small congregation called \\"I Am My Brother's Keeper\\" in a dilapidated church abandoned by the Presbyterians. Mitch, in part through his interactions with his rabbi, wants to give back to his community. Tentatively, this well off Jewish man begins reaching out to the impoverished Christian people he meets.    I won't give more than this away. This is a remarkable story and one that will stay with you for some time about how even though we have differences in our lives, we have so much more in common than we could ever imagine.

B001GCUNW6|1.0|This film has a plot that would support a film 10 or 15 minutes in length at most, so the film is mostly a clumsy pastiche of pointless diversions and a running gag.  What's more rendering (the process of transforming the mathematical description of each frame in to an image) is at best fair often just plain poor.  Quality rendering is quite expensive and the bean counters obviously decided this film wasn't worth it.  And they were right.  I just wish I hadn't bought it. But I was swayed by the previous two parts of this saga which are fairly good for what they are.      BTW I viewed the blu-ray version in my media room using an Epson 6500UB on a high gain screen.   If you really think you want it, do yourself a favor and wait till it hits the $5 bin.  You'll be glad you did.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Usually when I listen to a CD I'll skip a bunch of songs and there will only be a few that I actually like, so I was pleasantly surprised when I played this soundtrack and discovered I loved most of the songs except for a couple. To begin with, the soundtrack had the type of music I like. If you're not into indie rock or mellow music then this might not be the soundtrack for you. Most of the songs have a kind of quite eerie sound to them, which goes well with the theme of the book and movie, New Moon. My favorite songs have to be Friends and Roslyn, and the soundtrack is worth it to me for just those two songs but there are other great additions to the CD as well. I encourage you to give it a listen.

1905654294|5.0|I can only imaging how difficult it is to write a final book in a run of bestselling books. Reading the other reviews made me not want to read this book. Everyone kept saying comments like \\"jumped the shark.\\" I know that this book tends to reach out to young adults, and maybe many of these people want unresolved drama and death. If that is what you are looking for in an ending, this not the book the read. Meyer is trying to show how through love and cooperation, with her vivid characters, that you can overcome things and have that happy ending. I do not understand why some people would rudely return a book that they had read, or wish for Jacob's death. If that is what you are hoping for, then do not read this book. Meyer ends this on a good note with finality and demonstrating the importance of family. Maybe you would have to experience what it is like to not have a family and then become part of one in order to feel the meaning of this book. She somehow ties up all the loose ends and brings a great ending to this saga. I highly recommend this book, despite the other reviewers. I noticed that the older audience (greater than 20 years old) tends to enjoy this ending more than the younger audience. Maybe there is an understanding that dramatic writing does not need to end with a horrible dramatic finish in order to still have a good ending. Meyer weaves in drama throughout her book to keep you reading, while also bringing a finality to these books. I have read a lot of books before, and people write in their reviews of this book that some of these events are ridiculous. Have you ever thought of vampires and werewolves as ridiculous?

1416550542|5.0|You've got to hand it to Kate Morton. She follows up her brilliant debut \\"The Shifting Fog (The House at Riverton)\\" with another grand and sweeping historical novel that is a pleasure to read.    Set over three timeframes Morton follows a similar formula to her last novel as she sets about unravelling the story of Nell, a young English girl deposited on a ship on her own at the tender age of only four and sent off to Australia early in the 20th century. Through the use of Nell's own trip back to England in the mid 1970's and that of Nell's grand-daughter Cassandra some 30 years later, we delve into the lives of the enigmatic fairy-tale writer Eliza Makepeace and her cousin Rose Mountrachet as they live in the luxury of Blackhurst Manor and surrounds (which include the \\"forgotten\\" garden of the title) on the Cornish coast of England.    Morton writes in a splendid slow-burning style, her characters are well-rounded and interesting, and she conveys the sense of the times she writes of in convincing style.     To be savored.

B002HWBS96|4.0|I liked this performance a great deal but it didn't live up to its potential.  The singing was very good overall but the voices of Koch and Damerau just didn't seem to mesh very well.  I've never been a big fan of Fleming but she is superb here, both singing and acting wise.  The production was beautifully done but the floor to ceiling mirrors was often distracting, particularly in acts 1 and 3.  If you were in the auditorium it wouldn't have been a problem, but on the small screen when the focus is on just a portion of the action, it was often confusing to see the reflection of so many people scurrying around right behind the main characters.  The orchestra played well but somehow it just didn't seem to have the glistening shine that I've heard from others, particular the Vienna Philharmonic.  The director added some interesting touches but made a major mistake with the presentation of the rose.  Sophie and Octavian should be facing each other during most of the singing, not facing forward.  He also allowed Koch and particularly Damerau to overact during act 2.  All that being said, I would still high recommend purchasing this DVD.  It is worth it for the performance of Fleming alone.    My favorite performance is from the Met with Kiri Te Kanawa, Tatiana Troyanos, Judith Blegen and Kurt Moll.  It is nigh on perfect and had the luxury of Pavarotti as the Italian Singer.  I can only hope it appears some day on DVD to replace the DVDs I made from VHS tape.

0740785508|5.0|I'm a software engineer, I like to say \\"I'm not paid to type, I'm paid to think.\\" Similarly, this book is mainly about how creating a fantasy painting is less about brush strokes, although that is covered, but more about the preparations before the first stroke of the final canvas is taken. It's about building models,story telling, experimenting with composition, trying different light sources, sketching, tone studies, finding costumes, figuring out what plants match which dinosaur, talking to paleontologists, hashing out ideas with engineers, all those things that if left undone will end up with work that is not 100% satisfactory.<br /><br />I can't say this book is inspiring, because I'm not exactly inspired to go out and do all these things.  That's too much work for me as an occasional dabbler; but reading the book does raise my level appreciation for the effort behind the paintings I see and might check out for a few seconds, but which take 2 weeks of constant labor to create.<br /><br />So, I would imagine there are two groups of buyers of this book: those who enjoy fantasy paintings and want to add a new level of appreciation and understanding of that genre, and those who are committed to becoming professional artists and are prepared for the amount of discipline needed to succeed in the field. Both groups will find this book worthy of their time and money. Artists should appreciate the detailed assessment of tools, environment, materials, and mundane details of the creative process.<br /><br />I try not to give out too many 5 star reviews, but this book is really a great value for the price, is obviously the product of years of sustained effort and excellence, and is useful, beautiful and informative. It can be read from cover to cover, left out as coffee table book just for the pictures, or gone over with children interested in dinosaurs and space aliens.
078513915X|5.0|I'm an big Austen fan and so I ordered this graphic novel version of Pride and Prejudice just to see what they'd done with the story. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the result. The author did a good job of abridging the story down enough that it would fit the format of a graphic novel but not so much that the essence of the story was in any way changed. I noticed that most of the dialogue was directly from the original text, although some was created here and there to move the story forward.<br /><br />The illustrations of the characters and the locations seem like original interpretations to me -- in other words, they're not just illustrations of the various actors and actresses who've appeared in the two recent movie versions of the story. They look like 19th century people for the most part although it's definitely drawn in the rather dramatic style of most graphic novels I've seen. In some cases, the women especially looked a little older and a little harder than I thought they should.<br /><br />Some people might be appalled to think that literary classics like Pride and Prejudice have been made into graphic novels, but I would disagree.  Although Butler's retelling in no way replaces the original, I do think it adds an interesting interpretation. After all, screen writers have created several adaptations of the novel, and this one actually stays closer to the original than the screenplay for the 2005 movie (starring Kiera Knightly). My hope would be that someone who might not otherwise read the original might be inspired to do so after enjoying this version.

B0018M6J90|4.0|It's taken over 65 years for Winifred Watson's novel, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY, to get to the movie screen, but it's been well worth the wait.<br /><br />London is on the brink of World War 2, and times are tough; but things look particularly grim for one Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand).  She's a children's nanny who can't seem to find her niche, instead living a desperate hand-to-mouth existance in the slums and soup-kitchens of the city; but everything turns around when she manages to land a job as \\"social secretary\\" to the dizzy American nightclub singer, Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams).<br /><br />Delysia's complicated love-life needs a firm hand, and Miss Pettigrew fits the bill nicely, managing to turn her brief 24 hours of service into a life-changing experience neither of them will forget.<br /><br />MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is a giddy romantic period romp, the perfect screen adaptation of Watson's fondly-remembered novel.  Rising star Amy Adams (\\"Enchanted\\", \\"Doubt\\") adds another delightful role to her canon; Frances McDormand makes the character of Miss Pettigrew come to life with lots of untold layers.  Lee Pace shines as Delysia's piano-playing boyfriend; with Shirley Henderson, Mark Strong and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds.
B000003CMB|5.0|Great CD.  Never get tired of listening to it.  You forget just how good the band is.

B002HNA9LS|5.0|What follows is a listing of this 30 CD box's contents. I have copied this listing from another review on amazon.com/uk where you can purchase this box at a lower price with free shipping from amazon (see it here: [...])<br /><br />I'm enjoying this set immensely - but you should note that while the discs contain complete works, some do not necessarily contain the complete contents of the original discs. For example, you get the Duruffle Qaurtre Motets, but not his Requiem with the sublime performance by Jeffrey Best and the Englsih Chamber Orchestra. This is an outstandingly beautiful chamber performance and deserves to be heard - even if you need to purchase it separately [[ASIN:B000002ZIS Maurice Durufl&eacute;: Requiem; Quatre Motets]]<br /><br />As for the performances conducted by Herreweghe, well, if you haven't heard them you are in for a treat. Virtually any of his recordings top most critics &#34;Best Recordings&#34; lists - both for overall performance as well as Harmonia Mundi's outstanding engineering.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? If you enjoy Sacred Music you will surely be moved profoundly and deeply. Even if you are an agnostic like myself, you will no doubt consider this collection a blessing! These are performances for the ages; grouped together in an unusually sturdy and attractive box, all at an attractive price.<br /><br />Here is are the disc contents from amazon.com/UK along with the original reviewers pithy comments:<br /><br />CD1 Early Christian Chant (5th -13th Century)<br />Chant, chant, chant! You won't want to listen to this many times unless you are a chant specialist.<br />CD2 Gregorian Chant<br />Includes Messe de Requiem gregorienne, Cistercian Chant and Magnus liber organi More chant...<br />CD3 Birth of Polyphony (1100-1300)<br />Includes music from Notre-Dame School, hockets from the Bamberg Manuscript, etc., etc. Now it's getting more interesting!<br />CD4 Polyphonic Motet from Ars Antiqua to the Renaissance<br />Includes 14th Century English music (Hilliard Ensemble), Dufay, Dunstable, Plummer, and from the Renaissance Desprez, Janequin, Byrd, Gesualdo and Hassler<br />CD5&6 Polyphonic Mass from Middle Ages to the Renaissance<br />Machaut - Messe de Notre Dame, Desprez - Missa Pange Lingua, Janequin - Messe `La Bataille'<br />Lassus - Missa `Tous les regretz', Palestrina - Missa `Viri Galilaei, Byrd - Mass for 4 Voices<br />CD7 French `Petit Motet' and `Grand Motet'<br />Dumont, Lully, Delalande and Charpentier Te Deum.<br />CD8 Lamentations & Tenebrae<br />Music by Massaino, Lassus, Charpentier, Couperin, and Krenek<br />CD9/10 Monteverdi Vespro della beata Vergine - Herreweghe<br />In my opinion not such a good recording as the one by Rene Jacobs, but nice to have to compare.<br />Also Vespro Solenne by G Rovetta (1596-1668) from Cantus Colln and Konrad Junghanel. This is beautiful!<br />CD11/12 Alessandro Scarlatti - Cain overo Il Primo Omicidio - Rene Jacobs<br />A great recording of Scarlatti's oratorio of the story of Cain and Abel. Good orchestral playing, excellent soloists.<br />CD13/14 Handel - Messiah - Les Arts Florissants, William Christie<br />A very creditable Messiah. It certainly beats both my Huddersfield Choral Society and my Bernstein version, and comes pretty close to the more exciting Rene Jacobs version. The soloists here are good - Barbara Schlick, Sandrine Piau, Andreas Scholl (excellent), Mark Padmore and Nathan Berg.<br />CD15/16 Mendelssohn - Paulus - Herreweghe<br />This work was new to me, and on a single hearing is beautifully performed, if perhaps a little understated.<br />CD17 Music for the Reformed Church<br />Music by Sermisy, L'Estocart, Tallis, Purcell, Schutz, Bruhns and a Missa brevis in F by Bach.<br />The Bruhns cantata made me want to investigate his music further.<br />CD18&19 Bach - Christmas Oratorio - Rene Jacobs<br />A simply stunning recording. Soloists are Dorothea Roschmann, Andreas Scholl, Werner Gura and Klaus Hager.<br />CD20&21 Stabat Mater<br />On these CDs we get Stabat Maters by Pergolesi (the well known Rene Jacobs/Sebastian Hennig performance), Boccherini (Agnes Mellon/Ensemble 415/Chiara Banchini), Vivaldi (Scholl/Ensemble 415/Chiara Banchini) and Rossini (RIAS Kammerchor/Creed).

B002SJIO4A|4.0|DO NOT!!! Base your desicion of seeing this movie on other people's opinions.Distric 9 is a win or lose kind of movie,you either love it or you hate it.I recommend that you see the movie regardless of what people say.I actually loved the movie.At first I was a little unsure because I hate alien movies(they scare me)but my boyfriend really wanted to see it.To my suprise it wasn't scary at all.True it was a bit of gore, blood, and alien guts but I found myself feeling so emotional for the aliens.I was crying during some scenes and I couldnt believe that people could be so crule.This movie was not what I expected.I thought that it was a movie about some alien invasion that turned into them wanting to stay and kill all humans and take over...or at least something like that but I was so wrong.It was the complete opposite.I won't spoil it for anyone but like I said before go see the movie for yourself.
0920668364|5.0|\\"Love Your Forever\\" is a classic.  We read this to our son repeatedly in his early years.  When I read this alone years later - after our son matured into adulthood -  it brought tears to my eyes.    It documents simply and effectively parental love for a helpless human being who did not ask to be born.  It describes how this love transcends transition of the child from helplessness to self-reliance in adulthood.  The book is in part a tale of morality: parental responsibility for the child's well-being lasting a lifetime despite the child's growing independence (see Bernard Weiner, 2006, Erlbaum publishers, for academic, cognitive interpretation of social motivation and moral emotions, but mostly in adult interactions).    From a psychoanalytic perspective, the book inadvertently describes conflict between the child's growing independence and parental memories of the child's original helplessness.  As the child matures, he/she has no memory of the early days.  Hence Alfred Adler (1870-1937) describes a \\"Will to Power\\" as the maturing child flexes his/her own psychological independence from parental support.  Carl Jung (1875-1961) describes this process as \\"Individuation.\\"    Regardless, \\"Love You Forever\\" is mostly for parents: the sentiment and emotionality of responsible parents experiencing maturation of their precious offspring.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|This CD is a beautiful and evocative musical masterpiece. From start to finish, one of the best CD's that I have listened to in quite some time. I think that it is Knopfler's best solo effort yet. Can't wait to see some of these songs live!
B00139XZF4|1.0|I bought this since it was listed in the kids and family section. Its clearly not for young kids.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|This movie sucked. The red haired girl was hot. The guy that played Duke cannot act. Just not a good movie. Dennis Quaid even sucked. Sieanna Miller sucked too. The two good thing: looking at the red head & the suprise guest appearance by SPOILER BELOW<br /><br />GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.<br /><br />Suck suck sucked.
1416550534|3.0|After reading The Forgotten Garden I was eager to read another work by Kate Morton.  And while The House at Riverton was just as well written, I found the plot less to my liking.  I'm not going to summarize the book, since countless other reviewers have already done that and this is not a book report, after all.  I will simply say that it is a story about the Hartford family in the early years of the 20th century.  Everyone in the family (except one and I won't say who that is as that would be a spoiler) leads a mostly sad and unhappy life before meeting an early and tragic death.  Perhaps the most tragic of all are the two sisters Hannah and Emmeline, around whom the plot revolves.<br /><br />Just as in her other book The Forgotten Garden, Morton tells what could easily become a sordid tale without ever letting it become so.  The House at Riverton is a thoroughly sad story with very few bright spots in it, and yet thankfully Morton does not allow it to becomde dark or disturbing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the central core of the story is a tale of illicit love and adultery.  Again, Morton does not get explicit.  Even so, these are themes that are contrary to my personal values and so this book is not one I will keep or ever re-read.  Another reviewer commented on Morton's use of the \\"f\\" word near the end of the book;  I, too, was extremely disappointed that the author felt the need to insert such language into the book.  That alone cost the book a star.<br /><br />It was conspicuous to me that all of the Americans in House at Riverton were obnoxious and boorish.  And while I wasn't offended by this as some other reviewers were, I do think it was a poor choice for Morton to give such a one-sided and unflattering portrayal of Americans.  We don't hold the monopoly on bad behavior!!!  She could have made at least one American a sympathetic character (Teddy probably came the closest, and then only because he was trying to be English), and/or made some of her unpleasant characters be something other than American.  The American tourists were especially uncouth - I thought that was unfair, really.<br /><br />Both of Kate Morton's books are well-written; there is no doubt that she is a highly gifted writer.  However, after the House at Riverton my feelings about her work are more mixed, and whether I will read her next book is uncertain.  The Forgotten Garden also included an element of adultery, but it was not so central as in The House at Riverton.  Perhaps with her third book Kate Morton will just leave it out entirely.  That would be nice.other than American.   The American tourists were especially uncouth - I thought that was unfair, really.

0810983915|5.0|My 3rd grader discovered the Wimpy Kid series in second grade. He's read every one and loves them! He and his friends couldn't wait for the release of Dog Days. He says he likes reading this series because it's funny, he likes the cartoons (helps with comprehension too), and he can relate to the characters.
B002Q4TKAY|2.0|Brandon was quoted as saying this week that this is a \\"pretty solid live\\" product. He's wrong.<br /><br />I was REALLY looking forward to this, and was soooo disappointed to hear Brandon's off-key chortling throughout many songs (he also sounds really out of breath in a lot of songs, in which he is gasping for air a lot; not to be overly critical, but it's very disconcerting and irritating to listen to that). Other songs seem to have been recorded differently (the sound is completely different from the previous song's sound). The concerts were amazing, so I am really bummed at the sound quality and singing quality of these songs. I think they should have recorded all of the tour, and then very selectively chosen the best-sounding tracks to put on the audio CD.<br /><br />The live DVD is better, because at least you have visuals to take your mind off the horrible sound/singing. However, this show was nothing compared to the show I saw in Miami, where there was no chortling and off-key singing. There is no question that they have really improved their live shows/stage presence/singing (I have seen them live countless times). However, this was a bad, bad show to base a live CD/DVD on. It's incredible how off-key he is on the majority of these songs. It makes you wonder how much work they do to his voice in the studio.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I ordered this series a couple weeks back, as I was in the mood for good period romance. I had worn out my copy of P&P (Firth/Ehle version). I could not have known how greatly N&S would surpass my expectations. This is my absolute favorite series and yes I love it more than P&P!  (sigh) This series has so much substance, so much heart, so much realism.  I found myself smiling when the characters smiled, crying when they cried and absolutely swooning over Mr. Thornton. *grin* The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful.  I've had the DVD less than a week and I've already watched it twice. Now I am on the hunt for another period romance/drama that could at least halfway fill the shoes of N&S. (sigh) But I'm afraid N&S has ruined me for all other period dramas.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Best Album in the last 15 years...althought others were good too, this one stands out big time. The new Lead player, Chris Broderick, is outstanding.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|Still good after all these years.  Kevin Bacon's interview is GREAT.  AWsome songs made for the movie fit in perfectly.
B002OVEB5S|2.0|Does everyone remember what Slayer was like before they put out \\"Christ Illusion\\" and thier new CD?  Well... I'll tell ya, Slayer, In case you are not familiar with them, are one of the most infamous metal bands that has ever stalked the planet.  As far as being infamous I refer to thier lyrical subject matter.  I can recall when I was growing up how afraid people were of Slayer.  Even dudes that were into Metallica and Megadeth and stuff like that would say: \\"that's some crazy stuff, man.\\"  The Lyrics were gross and full of satanism.  Slayer was not the first band to sell the devil but they did it in a grand style.  Before them, a band called Black Sabbath lightly toyed with 'ol scratch.  A few years later another band, Venom, who would be very influential to Slayer blasted a blaze of fire across the new wave of British heavy metal.  Unlike Black Sabbath, Venom did not sugarcoat Satan.  Practically all of Venom's albums have satanic symbols and meanings on thier covers and most of thier songs are about demons, sacrifice, and possession.  Then, in 1983, a new band comes along with the same idea and similiar image.  Slayer sang about the same type of stuff but with a different delivery.  One which had never been heard before.  Along with the blood-soaked words of death spewed out by Tom Araya, we also had music played at breakneck speed.  Dave Lombardo, Slayer's drummer, played faster than anyone else at the time.  He was also a wiz at double bass.  Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman played thier guitars like madmen!  King and Hanneman were a match made in hell.  Both of them would become influential themselves in thier own right as metal guitarits.  Tom Araya also played the bass as well as doing vocal duties.  Tom's voice is one of the most recognizable in metal and Slayer is known the world over.      Since the release of the first album, \\"Show no Mercy\\" in 1983, The band would go on to reach critical acclaim with records such as \\"Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss\\", and \\"God Hates us All.\\"  Slayer had proven to the world that evil lives and would carry on the fight even to this day...26 years later.  Whereas Slayer would release mostly great albums throughout the 1980's and 90's, after 2001's \\"God Hates us All\\" I would have to say they lost it after that CD.  \\"World Painted Blood\\" in my opinion is Slayer's version of Metallica's \\"Load\\".  A lot of what we love about Slayer is present on the new record but, there is a little too much different stuff going on.  Stuff I've never heard Slayer do.  There also seems to be something missing in the sound of the album as a whole.  Don't get me wrong, It's still heavy but, it just don't sound right.  Sounds kind of thin and light for a Slayer CD.  I don't think Tom Araya is loud enough either.  The songs themselves are a bit weak and discombobulated and never really seem to go anywhere.  Maybe I need to give it a few more listens to let it sink in some more.  I don't know.  One song I remember I really liked was \\"Public Display of Dismemberment\\".  I thought it was a really great tune on an otherwise drab album.     A DVD is included in the deluxe edition for a few dollars more.  Is it worth it?  Nah...unless you are a die-hard Slayer fan like myself.  Slayer could put thier name on a turd and I would buy it.  The DVD contains a short film.  It is made with photos that move in a sort of \\"stop action\\" style with parts of the new album as it's soundtrack.  It's kind of cool.  It's cool that they did something like that.  It's the first album I ever bought that included something other than behind the scenes stuff on a DVD.    Will Slayer make a comeback after this one?  I hope so.  I really don't know how much longer they will be around.  At least we have all the great music they made before thier last 2 CD's.  Oh well, once again in the future when Slayer puts out another new record, I will be waiting and hoping that it leaves these last two albums in the dust.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I have to disagree with the naysayers and \\"for completists only\\" crowd. Based upon some of the comments, I have to wonder if some of these reviewers even bothered to listed to the cd before giving their opinion. I admit that I approached Bob Dylan doing a Chritmas cd with much skepticism and very low expectations.  Dylan's last few discs have have left me cold- I found them uninspiring and nothing to get excited about. Christmas In The Heart not only is easily the best of his last few recordings, but one of the best Christmas discs I've heard in quite some time.     I played it through twice when I first opened it, something I don't generally do, and expect to get many years of pleasure from it. If you don't care for his voice- (nothing new for Bob, of course) then by all means, don't buy it. But if you enjoy Dylan and want an outstanding Christmas disc BUY IT NOW! The fact that Bob is donating all the proceeds to charity makes it a worthwhile purchase. In my opinion, Bob is in fine voice (yes- his voice is quite gravelly, now, folks) and the band and backup singers are superb!  I never cared for a few of the songs before I heard Dylan's versions. Now, they are among my favorites on the cd. Christmas music by Bob Dylan?? Absolutely!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Convenient product placement the main description points out up top when the pizza comes. Well yes it is, but it is also Pizza Hut that we did in fact get before the invasion. J.Lo's death rumor? Yes, it was a big concern for us before the invasion. Swearing and machismo? Its a bunch of young men away from home in a foreign war-torn land, you'll get that from time to time. This series brought back memories of the invasion I'd even forgotten over time. It shows how people can hate groups of people, but still be close as hell to those types of people because they are your fellow Marines. It shows the confusion of war, the lack of leadership and a plan we often saw, and the vacuum left behind after us and that swallowed us as well. I thought it was great, maybe someone who doesnt understand the lingo, the nitty gritty military details, or the background wouldnt, but I loved it.    SGT P. Graham   2/5 USMC  OIF 2003-05
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I grew up reading stephen king. but i wasnt aloud to read this one until here recently as an adult. and for good reason obviously. i watched the movie as a child. while it was scary it didnt give me nightmares. the book did!    i absolutely love this book and would recomment it to anyone. im THRILLED to finally see it in kindle addition. the 1000+ page book was hard to lug around.
1416594787|5.0|I found this book to be very informative.  While I expected it to provide arguments and evidence supporting the theory of evolution, Dawkins goes a step further. He shows how many of these discoveries were made.  I found the history of the theory and the continuing history of its supporters to be a great asset to this book.      I finished the book alarmed that anyone who claims to be rational and educated could possibly not believe in evolution and more alarmed yet by the statistics for just such beliefs in this country and others.  This book should be required reading for all high school students.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. All the songs are perfect for the movie and for Bella and Edward. Even my 9 year old daughter loves to listen to it. She asks for the \\"baseball song\\", song #1 on the soundtrack, everytime she gets into the car. This is a great buy and worth every dollar.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|'Castle' is an entertaining, witty and fast-moving detective series, much in the vein of greats like 'Moonlighting'. Richard Castle, played by a wonderfully sharp and sarcastic Nathan Fillion, is an egotistical crime writer who, short of inspiration,  starts to tag along with Homicide Detective Beckett (Stana Katic) on her cases, at first annoying her, but later garnering her begrudging respect as the series moves forward.     The balance between Castle's quirky home life and the cases to be solved is perfect - the only major flaw in the series seems to be Castle's ability to repetitively come to stunning conclusions when the detectives seem to have suddenly forgotten how to make basic deductions, leaving the viewer feeling some of the plotlines were overly contrived. Nevertheless, the chemistry between Fillion and gifted newcomer Katic is undeniable, although the role-reversal relationship between Castle and his daughter (played by the wonderful Molly Quinn) has to be the highlight of the series.    Overall, if you like snappy, clever dialogue, and a jolly decent mystery-with-a-twist, 'Castle' is for you.   At a strong 4.5, you won't be disappointed.
0143038419|5.0|It took me so long to read this book. Not because it was boring and I couldn't get into it, but because I wanted to take my time and not miss any of the hidden messages. I read a couple of chapters each night before bed and went to sleep with happy, inspirational, and motivational thoughts. I found that the solutions to some of her struggles, were also solutions to mine. I loved her journey and desire to take one of my own. What a life changing book. I must say I was sad when I finally did finish it.
B000SMWUPS|2.0|This item is good for holding your cell phone, kleenex or a water bottle but don't put too much in it. One of the straps broke on ours and we really didn't put too much in it. In fact I think we had two water bottles and some keys in there. It's not good for drinks that aren't completely closed. We had our take out coffee cups in it and they kept sloshing around. It serves it's purpose in holding the few things we want to bring with us but nothing more.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I love track #1 (Million Dollar Bill).  This tune has 'hit' all over it.  Not crazy about title track.  Very draggy and I kept waiting for something 'big' to happen.  Never did.  Good tracks on CD.  Stay well.  Stay strong and tear them up, vocally like you used to do and still 'can' do!
B002IYEQR4|3.0|I bought the first BluRay version of it, and at Best Buy the first week if you bought the movie, you got Tales of the Black Freighter for $5 more. I think that having the animation takes away from the film itself, and is better as a separate disk. If Black Freighter were live action, it would be a different story.     I get that it is coming out of a comic book and its ok that its animated, but it kinda slowes the film down. If you are super die hard fan and want the film to be EXACTLY like the graphic novel, which incorporates Black Freighter throughout, buy this version. If you're like me who likes the film as presented in the original Bluray version, with the extra footage, and feels like an animated side story would take away from the main story, making it a longer film, and would make it feel like its lagging, stick with the original. (When I got the Black Freighter I was lucky to get the Bluray version. The ad in the paper didn't specify bluray or reg dvd, so they sold me the Bluray version for 5 bucks. Regular price was $35!!! More than the actual movie, which was $24 at the time. $35 for a 25 minute animated short??? Come on, now! I lucked out i guess.)    In my opinion, Black Freighter should been included in the original bluray release instead of separate. You can see BF in its entirety, without interruption of the main film, which i thought was better. But this whole scam about selling separately then together really sucks. I wouldn't have BF if it werent $5 bucks. If anything, rent it!

0385737947|5.0|THE MAZE RUNNER is a gem. Really. I say that because the MAZE RUNNER is a story that will have any reader gripping it for dear life. I could not possibly put it down! You're gripped from the first page -the first thought of Thomas as he mysteriously finds himself in a strange community that is comprised solely of teenagers -young kids who are thrust together to fend for themselves and survive. And their survival isn't only dependant on their food supply but also on the thick walls that keep them safe from frightening creatures called Grievers. Worse yet, these kids have no memory of their life before and as Thomas comes to terms with his new life everything unravels into chaos and danger. And as a new and final member (and also the only girl) is brought into the group things are not what they seem and the need to figure out their pasts is imperative.<br /><br />Things are never what they seem in THE MAZE RUNNER. Things are always twisted and flipped and like the maze every turn is unexpected and exciting.  Fans of the HUNGER GAMES will devour this book and would maybe love it more. What I love most about this book is the nonstop excitement that will appeal to both girls, guys, old and young and leaves no one in between. With swift pacing and fun but brave cast of characters teens are sure to love this book from cover to cover.
B0028SVXR6|4.0|Having been a fan of TMV for only about 3 years now (stunning considering I've been into PROG for a good 25 years), my comments may not be taken seriously by the die-hards.  I do have the entire catalogue so I'm not a complete novice.    I can't understand the complaining.  Every release has had a different feel.  I found it very refreshing to hear a toned down Volta.  I love the chaos of Bedlam and the intricacy of FTM and so on but this gave me a chance to really hear their abilities as song writers.  This often is well presented in more formulaic hook-driven music.  There is enough chops here to give the hard-cores a chubby.  This is no downward spiral I'm sure.  Musicians (being one myself) have the same mood swings as any artist and perpetuate current moods by craft.      I dig this hell out of this CD and highly recommend it.  I think this would be a good starting point to new fans.  It's just odd enough to catch interest and melodic enough to not require 10 listens to absorb.  Bravo.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I can't say enough how much fun watching Season 1 has been.  I rarely catch anything on primetime, so I'm a little behind on the curve in giving Fringe its proper kudos.  I approached it somewhat apprehensively, being a big LOST fan but wondering if JJ Abrams sophomore effort could even match his first.  Fringe seriously exceeded all expectations.<br /><br />I think characters are better written in todays television than they have been in decades, and Fringe is no exception.  John Noble's Dr Bishop is absolutely phenomenal, and an authentic charaterization of genius/insanity.  His comments and outbursts are equal parts funny/interesting/creepy.  His son, Peter (Josh Jackson) is the most likeable criminal you'll meet.  There's solid chemistry between he and Agent Dunham (Anna Torv, who is probably my least favorite of the main characters), and even Astrid The Lab Agent does what she needs to do to play a good supportive cast member.<br /><br />The plotlines are far-out but believable enough to be credible and unsettling.  Almost never does Fringe give you the feeling that we are dealing with science-fiction, but more with science-gone-wrong (plausible, considering today's high-profit pharmaceutical industry).  It has a strong linear episodic path, and really keeps pulling you along from the Pilot on.  Special effects work well, and while not cutting edge, do their part.<br /><br />If dramas like Lost and The X-Files have at least at some point captured your liking, you will become a fan of Fringe very quickly.  Highly recommended.
B002MW50KY|5.0|If you are a fan of Bob Dylan's music and himself as an artist, then you will like this album. If you dislike his newer albums, you probably will not like this. I love Christmas music and I love Bob Dylan (1960-Present). This album did it for me. I feel Christmas in my heart.
B0026RCAGC|5.0|There are very many recordings of Fidelio out there. Most of them are available. I have listened to 80% of them, because this is my favourite opera. Two of all these recordings qualify as the very best: Christa Ludwig/Jon Vickers/Klemperer/EMI (Nilsson should have been Klemperer's Leonore but by some reason that idea never materialized) and Birgit Nilsson/James McCracken/Maazel/Decca.<br />Maazel's version has been reissued recently in two versions, one on the Decca/Eloquence label without texts and comments, and one (much better!) with texts and comments, also on Decca.<br />Both these versions, EMI and Decca, are very dramatic. When listening to Christa Ludwig I like what I hear but I cannot help remembering - from her memoirs - that she always was very afraid of the tessitura in this role.<br />Birgit Nilsson - in top form - sings with great intensity as if Leonore was an easy role. As you know, it is not.<br />If I did not have any recording of this masterpiece, I would chose BOTH Klemperer's and Maazel's
0743579275|5.0|I purchased the audio Cd version. The book is wonderfully put together. An excellent Read. Very thought provoking. A book I highly recommend. Especially to those whom have no understanding of evolution. It clearly explains (facts) that have only one conclusion; Evolution is the defacto.  Definitely, makes me wonder how unfortunate it is that there are such high numbers of individuals whom deny evolution. The evidence is there. Yet, there are entire movements against a rational base of understanding that is backed by (facts). This scares me. Ignorance can harm entire societies. Please grab a copy today!!!

B00005B5L4|5.0|Take an extremely popular album that was one of the first back-catalog reissues at the dawn of CD (when it did extremely well), give the 24-track masters to the engineers who originally recorded the album to remix it for 5.1 and even ask the band to contribute to the process, and what do you get? You get a virtually perfect approach to repurposing existing catalogue items for the new medium of DVD Music.<br /><br />I don't know many people who do not own a copy of Fleetwood Mac's seminal album Rumours in one form or another. I originally had the vinyl, sold it and got the CD, and now here is the latest reissue, surely the best of all: a DVD-A/V surround/stereo remix done by the team that not only recorded the original sessions, but is also at the forefront of the 5.1 surround and DVD-Audio revolution.<br /><br />5.1 Entertainment is Ken Caillat, Gary Lux et al, and from their West L.A. facility just off the 10 freeway, they are turning out one superb DVD-Audio remix after another. As one might imagine, this album is no exception, for no engineer can know these tracks as well as Ken Caillat. Here, they have done us proud.<br /><br />The disc itself includes Dolby Digital surround on the DVD-V area, plus stereo and surround 96 kHz, 24-bit mixes in the DVD-Audio section. Additionally, we can hear the band talking (often recorded by fellow Rumours original engineer Richard Dashut) about how the tracks came to be, and what was going on at the time. Behind their voices are instrumental surround mixes of the songs in question, and you can examine original scribbled lyric sheets and track sheets (if you can read the writing), as well as viewing photographs from the original sessions and other fascinating details.<br /><br />The album was originally made in 1977, on 24-track analogue multitrack. Inevitably, the narrow track width and other characteristics well known to engineers at the time render the sound quality rather below the level we might expect from today's all-digital recordings. But that source material limitation aside, everything has been transferred and remixed with astonishing care and attention to detail. The sound quality is noticeably better than that on the original CD, a testament to the enormous strides the technology of digital audio has taken since the mid-`80s. One presumes that the 24-track original was lifted direct from the multitrack into a high-quality A/D conversion system and from then on was processed and mixed entirely digitally. The entire process has been carried out in exemplary fashion.<br /><br />The material itself is so well known as to need no real comment, except one: there is an additional track here. Originally intended for the vinyl version, but not included on the first CD for some mysterious reason, Stevie Nicks' composition \\"Silver Springs\\" is quite as solid as the rest of the album, appearing here as Track 6. This pushes \\"Songbird,\\" originally in the Track 6 slot, to Track 12. Otherwise, the running order is unchanged. It must have been very difficult to choose the track to leave out, but for those with no memory of those days, vinyl gets even nastier than usual if you try to get more than 20 minutes on a side, and this number would have pushed it over the edge into lower levels, more distortion and poorer signal-to-noise ratio. Why it didn't get reinserted when the CD was mastered is another question entirely. Yes, of course, this material does show its age somewhat. But it sounds as good now - actually significantly better - as it did a quarter of a century ago. If you liked it then, I am sure you'll love it now.<br /><br />The stereo 96kHz remixes presented here appear from their content and balance to be the originals, but there is also a lot of added detail and life to the tracks. Simply transferring the original mixes with modern conversion systems would have done the trick, adding clarity and transparency at the top end and power and tightness in the bass, as well as detail that quantization noise would have hidden in earlier times. Modern digital noise removal systems could have dropped the noise floor cleanly and evenly.<br /><br />On the surround front, one could almost imagine that Ken Caillat had been thinking about this project for years - that 5.1 Entertainment was set up just so that this album could be released. The mixes are exquisite and as utterly natural as the stereo versions. Nothing is there for effect; nothing is gratuitous; these mixes are simply presented and come across as if this was originally what was intended. The final product was mastered, of course, by Bob Ludwig - and it seems to me that the vast majority of great-sounding DVD-music discs out there are mastered by the master himself. Even in the highest realms of digital audio, mastering is not simply a transfer: it is as much an art as it was in the days of vinyl.<br /><br />If you have always enjoyed this album as I have, you will want this new version in your library. It does the original full justice and it is a fine example of how to do the job of remixing and reissuing classic albums of the past in new digital and surround formats. Congratulations to everyone involved. -- Richard Elen, Audio Video Revolutiontimes. Modern digital noise removal systems could have dropped the noise floor cleanly and evenly.

0385737947|5.0|This book has been very well reviewed so I won't go into the details. I'm an adult but not young but the YA genre doesn't matter. I really liked this fantasy mystery, boys and one girl put in a mysterious world and put to trying to figure out the puzzle and mystery that confronts them. The ending is the setting for the next book in the trilogy and I certainly will buy that also. What world will the boys face next? What will be their next task, the next mystery to solve? This book is recommended reading for everyone.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed Da Vinci Code although it was pretty much highjacked verbatim from Holy Blood Holy Grail.  And eventhough I wasn't expecting as much from this book, it was very disappointing.   First the good part.  I learned a lot about the buildings and symbols in D.C., as well as things I didn't know about the Masons.  Unfortunately, Brown's style of writing is much like a seventh grader who has just discovered the exclamation point.  Less is more doesn't enter into the arena.  Breathless wow! moments abound ad infinitum and leave the reader exhausted.  I thought the end was never going to end.  The denoument came and went and still Brown went on! and on! and on!  If your time is limited for your pleasure reading, don't use it up on this one.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|No, seriously, the mono mix of \\"Helter Skelter\\" is overwhelmingly powerful and worth the cost of the set for any true Beatles fan. And for some reason, all of John's songs from the \\"White Album\\" are a lot punchier. In general, the background vocals and percussion really pop in these mixes, while Paul's bass, overly prominent in the stereo versions, is mixed down somewhat, resulting in a more balanced mix overall. Of course, the mono mix of \\"Pepper' is the only way to hear that album. So what are you waiting for?
B002MRROKS|2.0|The DVD is a must buy, very good performance uncut. but the cd? no.    Honestly, It's to bad because this is a great show, but the big wigs got their hands on it. Sadly, this release is the result of very poor mixing. Whoever was in charge of this release should honestly be looked at like \\"what were you thinking?\\" They added fake crowd noise before every single song. Annoying yet somewhat acceptable. I first read about the crowd noise before my purchase and agreed it was still worth a listen. I entered the CD in my player and hit play. Wow, I first was just blown away by how terrible the audio quality is. It sounds like a low bit rate digital media file with a added constant low hiss. I have a high quality audiophile setup, I really enjoy hearing the highs/clarity in my music. Yet, I cannot fully enjoy this album because of the sheer Low-Fi sound it has. I understand this is a live recording however that is not what I am talking about. I have heard bootlegs recorded with a stage mic that had better sound reproduction than this. It has a 'Mono' sound to it, it sounds very one layered and muddy. Also, all the enjoyable banter/messing around was removed from the release and only the songs themselves remain. I will definitely not be buying this on vinyl and will still look for the bootleg version. I am glad they released the DVD quality video, but really disappointed by the audio mixing done for this release.    I recommend just buying the DVD or DVD/CD release (if the price is right). Reason being is that I only had to pay $2 extra to get the cd thrown in with the dvd and to me, It was worth the purchase even if I had known the cd was a disappointment.    The DVD is great, so much new footage. They did a good job on it. You will be really happy to see this performance. I was.

B001PR0YDA|5.0|This has been one heckofa year for animation films.  I can think of at least 3 movies that should get nominated: Disney's A Christmas Carol, Ponyo and Up.  I have no idea to which film I would give the Oscar because they were all good.  I loved everything about this film--especially the visuals.  (I really felt like I was roaming the streets of old London.)  I loved how they incorporated \\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\\" into the movie.  I loved how faithful the movie was to the Dickens classic.  Arguably the best adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  Go see it.  Highly recommended.
B001T30232|5.0|I bought this book while on vacation in August in Maine, it looked interesting.  This book was amazing, the characters were real and Enzo gave me lots of insight into how my dogs might think.  This is by far in my top five best reads. Its so not in the caliber of Marley and Me this is a story from Enzos perspective, by the way Enzo is the dog.
B002ONC9MS|2.0|**Warning--This review may contain spoilers**--'An Education' is a film rife with one implausible character after another. For starters, when we're introduced to the protagonist, high school student Jenny, she seems way too sophisticated for a 16 year old. The main problem is that Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, is 24 years old in real life. Why didn't they cast a teenager?<br /><br />Then there's the problem of the girl's father, Jack. At first he appears extremely petulant, a caricature of the pushy parent who wants their child to succeed at any cost. With his insistence that Jenny study night and day in order to get into Oxford, we're first led to believe that he's the film's antagonist. But soon when con-artist David appears on the scene, Jack is suddenly reduced to unprincipled buffoon. I say buffoon because he's so easily taken in by David's scheme--that David is actually an Oxford alumni and knows famous Oxford professor/author C.S Lewis. If this was a real character, wouldn't have Jack made a few simple inquiries to determine whether David was telling the truth or not?<br /><br />In very simplistic fashion, the implication here is Jenny's sudden embrace of a life of crime is due to Jack's lack of principles. David basically buys Jack's acquiescence in allowing Jenny's trips away from home and ultimately accepting the idea of Jenny and David tying the knot. Somehow all this so easily rubs off on impressionable Jenny. The gutless father figure is nothing new--just think of Jim Backus strutting around in an apron in 'Rebel without a cause'.<br /><br />Perhaps the moment I found to be the most incredulous was Jenny's sudden transformation from earnest student to unsavory bad girl. Even with the father acting the way he did, would she have so suddenly embraced David once she discovers that he's a con artist? I would think that a normal teenager would have been very alarmed that she was now in the company of a bunch of criminals and fear would have entered into the equation. But what was Jenny's reaction? A mild protest and then David sweeps her off her feet.<br /><br />David was disappointing in that he was such a tame sociopath. What are his crimes? Well, he steals an antique map from a house that's up for sale and arranges for minorities to move into apartment buildings, scaring elderly tenants, and then buying the apartments from them when they decide to leave, at cut-rate prices. Oh yes, he also cheats on his wife. Equally disappointing is the couple he hangs out with--except for one scene where there is a confrontation with Jenny, they really have little to do.<br /><br />Every melodrama needs a villain and that is of course the headmistress of the school Jenny attends. After she finds out David is Jewish, she blurts out that the Jews \\"killed our Lord\\". Not only is she depicted as a vile anti-Semite but she cruelly rejects Jenny's request to be reinstated. Only Jenny's kindly teacher is willing to give her encouragement.<br /><br />There is nothing subtle about 'An Education'. It's an old-fashioned morality play where the good guys (educated professionals) triumph over shiftless petty criminals who hang out at such unsavory venues as dog tracks and seedy nightclubs. Everything is tied up in a nice ribbon at the end when both Jenny and her father repent and Jenny is miraculously accepted into Oxford.<br /><br />'An Education' is a tawdry little tale that has already garnered a good share of undeserved accolades. It does boast a nice recreation of early 60s London along with a brooding score but in terms of psychological insight and depth of character, it totally lacks any kind of aesthetic credibility.s Jenny's reaction?

0385504225|2.0|It is what it is and as a writer Dan Brown is Dan Brown. I don't want to fall into describing what the book isn't, or what Dan Brown as a writer isn't, as so many media reviewers do with Brown. No one will call him a dazzling prose stylist. It is an interesting summer or airplane read and is certainly swiftly paced. However, for a book based on so much action, it is remarkably static. Whether purposeful or not, the plot twists and ending were fairly predictable early in the book. It is obviously deeply researched and once again on a topic Dan Brown has a real passion for. The book is an entertainment, and on that point it succeeds, but it is just an entertainment.

B000784WMW|5.0|I have been looking for this version for quite sometime and was thrilled to find it here and for a reasonalble price.  It is 311 minutes long so be prepared for a long time infront of the tv.  However, you can watch it by chapters and there is only one dvd so you only have to flip it when you are ready for the next chapters.  Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is excellent.  I wish that Zelah had made more films. Enjoy if you are as much a fan of Jane Eyre as I am.
B002GU605G|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this set because the mastering on the last two releases from the cult has been atrocious (Born into This & Beyond Good and Evil).  Super loud, brickwalled, clipped, zero dynamic range, heavy digital distortion, fatiguing, are some of the ways I'd describe those two albums.  I listened to them once and then sold them.  For more info you can google 'loudness war'.<br /><br />Luckily this set does not suffer from the same terminal problem.  It's not an audiophile mastering, but it is a good mastering.  There is enough dynamic range so that the music has some punch to it.  The drums hits do make an impact, unlike say Beyond Good and Evil where the drums make no impact whatsoever and the distortion is brutal.  The bass too sound nice and full on this release, unlike the the last two releases.  All in all, the guy at Loud Mastering did a good job (maybe they should rename the mastering house 'not too Loud Mastering).<br /><br />The packaging is fantastic, I don't think Beggars cut any corners on this one.<br /><br />So if you're a cult fan, get this before its OPP.

B002QQ8HAG|4.0|\\"The September issue\\" (2009), directed by RJ Cutler, is a behind-the-scenes documentary about the production of the September 2007 Vogue issue. Of course, this documentary is also about Anna Wintour, the woman who has been Editor in Chief of American Vogue since 1988, and that is also rumored to have been the inspiration for the \\"boss from hell\\" in the film \\"The Devil wears Prada\\".<br /><br />Cutler's crew was given ample access to Anna Wintour's meetings with her staff, and went with Anna to many activities that are part of her job, for example fashion shows and visits to fashion designers. The director was also granted final cut rights, and it is easy to see that in the result he achieved, this interesting and somewhat hard-edged documentary, where elegant clothing and caustic remarks are similarly pervasive.<br /><br />\\"The September issue\\" provides the spectator with a glimpse into the hard and extremely competitive world of the fashion business, where only the fittest seem to survive and even photos of very beautiful women need to be digitally enhanced. This documentary also allows us to know a little more about Anna Wintour, probably one of the more influential women in that world, and someone who happens to be rather scary when she thinks that her staff's efforts are below the standards of excellence and innovation expected from them.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I enjoyed watching \\"The September issue\\" and that I can recommend it to you, provided that you are at least remotely interested in the fashion world and the way it works.<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B00001QEBQ|5.0|THIS IS A CUTE MOVIE AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT; ESPECIALLY MY FAVORITE MOOSHOO.(EDDIE MURPHY)
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|We went to see this simply because I noticed Alaska was featured and a family member was over there at the time. I assumed the movie would be fun but I didn't expect it to be this much fun. This is clearly because I've never that I can recall seen Sandra Bullock before and my, what I've missed! Good though Ryan Reynolds is, Bullock is outstanding in this movie, and now I've seen some more of her movies, I realise just how extremely good she is even if some of the movies she's starred in haven't been as good as she deserves. But all of them I've seen now have been very enjoyable as she clearly has the ability to lift even somewhat inferior material.     The story is fairly standard romcom, although the frequent old theme of difficult man and putupon or ignored younger woman is neatly reversed - I understand Bullock is older than Reynolds, and that works extremely well - it makes a nice change in fiction although in real life it seems more and more relationships are older woman-younger man these days.     Highly recommended!
B002V33ZLU|1.0|With Water running low the crew have to find replacement supplies.  I enjoyed the Pilot Air show but after that it has become getting worse and worse.  The Characters like to complain about petty stuff.  The only good Character right now is \\"Eli's\\" character because he has the tenacity to stand up for what he believes in.<br /><br />There seems to be building a \\"Soap Opera\\" feel, the characters are the one creating drama.  The only ones that are worth mentioning is the is Col. Young and Matthew Scott when they were trying to save themselves from dieing.  I admit I loved the sand alien but that along the way.  I don't like how Greer is acting towards everyone or to that alien.  If you love Sci-Fiction this isn't one of those shows you will sink your teeth into but it is a good filler for some time.

0230014917|4.0|The \\"Odd Egg\\" is a cute book about a group of birds, all of whom have laid an egg -- except for Duck.  Chicken, Flamingo, Owl, Parrot and a cute unidentifiable bird like a wren, all have eggs... but not Duck.  And then, one day, he finds an egg.  (Yes, Duck is a boy, which might explain why he didn't lay an egg.)  And it's not just any egg.  It is a HUGE, white egg with green spots.<br /><br />Duck thinks his egg is grand, but the others aren't so sure.  In any case, they all sit down and await the day when their eggs hatch.  And they do!  All except the BIG egg.  The tension builds for kids as one by one the other babies are born... and then, crack!, the big baby does hatch.<br /><br />Talking Points:::<br /><br />\\"The Odd Egg\\" is a cute book that is well worth tracking down at the library.  The artwork is simple and in soothing muted tones.  The story has a surprising ending if you are a small person:  older Toddlers and Preschoolers and Kindergartners.<br /><br />The center section of the book is really nicely done as the pages have been cut down so that they overlap and hide some of the action until you flip them over.  Thus what you see at first is a line of expectant parents and a line of cracking eggs.  Then with the first flip you see the 'wren' fly forwards to greet it's baby.  And with the next flip you find the chicken hugging it's newborn chick.  It's the sort of things young children love to toy with.<br /><br />When it comes to the last egg, moms might want to preview the ending as it shows feathers and birds flying off in all directions.  (Actually it shows their feet, but there's a sense of distress)  I know 98% of children are only going to laugh and giggle at this, but I happened to have had a son in the 2% who this would have bothered.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Not much to say about these, they are great quality and very comfortably. I would highly recommend them for recording as well as use with programs such as Guitar Rig or Amplitube, which is why I purchased them. I wouldn't use these headphones for listening to mp3's outside the house, not just because they are expensive, but because the closed eared sound is probably not the best thing to have while in public, and personally if I'm not recording music, I prefer to have ear buds or non closed headphones.<br /><br />Regardless of what you use them for, you shouldn't be disappointed with these.
6304698690|5.0|I've watched this video since it was on VHS and that was all that I knew, and besides it's poor quality and remembering where it had always skipped, the DVD quality was crisp and clean, and was much better, and it never dies! (unless you like running it over or playing hockey with it[scratch, scratch, shatter, shatter) A very enjoyable film, will watch again and again!
0810983915|5.0|My son loves the series so we have all the books.  It is a book boys can relate with and enjoy reading.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I bought this collection a few years ago and had great difficulty with the CDs skipping around and indicating that the computer was attempting to fix a problem.  This happened in many of the CDs until I became frustrated and put the whole thing away.    I thought that maybe if I tried for the umpteenth time that it would work.  NOT.    Do not buy this collection.  There is something majorly wrong with the CDs.    Sincerely,    Charleen
B000LPR9ZS|1.0|How Could Anybody like this Movie.  It is the Worst Movie ever made.  Nuff Said
1587613379|5.0|In an age where there seem to be nearly unlimited choices for relating, and truly unlimited guilt and shame attached to all things sexual, Dossie Easton succeeds in walking that fine line between being true to self and ones very real needs and desires, and being true to the basic precepts of honesty and ethical behavior that are the hallmarks of mature adult behavior - and which seem to be sorely lacking in most writings about \\"alternative\\" lifestyles and practices.    Though many will decry polyamory as just another excuse for promiscuity, Dossie makes it clear that this is, in fact, truly about loving and being loved unconditionally, as is our birthright - if only we have the courage to try.    Polyamory is not easy, it will never \\"fix\\" an existing flawed relationship (indeed it will almost certainly hasten its' demise!), and it works only between individuals who can be completely honest, even when honesty hurts. Given that, \\"The Ethical Slut\\" is a decent roadmap toward an expression of our true potential as lovers and partners.  Definitely worth reading, and re-reading, if poly is a serious interest, or if you're just curious.  It'll make you think, if nothing else.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I have to admit, when I saw the previews for this movie I wasn't interested. People told me it wasn't any good, so I didn't see it. We decided to rent it and was blown away. It was just awesome! Define awesome... well imagine all the cool things you can do in a cartoon, but can't do in real life. Some how this movie has bridged the gap. The computer animation was off the chain, but what made it a good movie was the fact that it had a sense of depth at the heart of it. Something here in  America we can relate to.. That some fat cats out there want to turn everything we love into a cash cow and a lot of time don't mind breaking the law to do it. (economic crisis ring a bell?) Take football, basketball, etc its not about the game anymore its about the money...but even though this is a movie, it calls to those who wish someone could just break up the greed, exploitation, and marketing BS. Bring it back to the love of it all...
B0015ABRE2|5.0|The third season of Dexter moves right along where the last season left off. Distrrict attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) becomes Dexter's new friend, though he becomes a little too interested in Dexter's shadowy life. All through the season Dexter (Michael C. Hall) also gets closer to living a normal, domestic life as he and Rita are about to get married. Dexter must learn to adjust to this new aspect of his life as he loses more of his freedom, and his ability to lead a double life becomes more complicated.<br /><br />As with past seasons there is one major new serial killer to deal with. This time there is the Skinner, so named because he leaves his victims missing patches of their skin. One major change in the third season is the fantasy sequences with Dexter imaging what his father is thinking, as he gives his son guidance, ideas, or arouses guilt. In past seasons flashbacks were  used when Dexter was remembering his father. This fantasy elements adds an interesting sub layer to Dexter's thought processes, and perhaps could also be saying something about how Dexter is dealing with the trauma's of his life through fantasy, or perhaps even through split personality. Is this a crack in the Dexter psyche? the beginning of a sort of psychosis, even as he is supposedly becoming more normal. The third season offers just as many thrills, and twists, and intriguing characters as previous seasons in this continually fascinating TV series.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|this a a wonderful addition to our Disney collection.  My daughter is only 2, but loves anything princess.
0440242401|4.0|This book a light read and perfect for a vacation ! it is fast paced and well written. Often chick lit can sound contrived and very very flaky, but this book bypasses that style and lends elegance to chicklit. The story revolves around Lexi who wakes up after a car accident with amnesia and is unable to recall how she landed up living her current life. She seems to have gone back to a more simpler time in her life when she was happier, more 'human' and more fun. Its interesting to see how things pan out for Lexi! super fun book !
031604461X|3.0|Only recently was I sucked into the the Twilight \\"zone\\".  I enjoyed Twilight and New Moon a lot, excited slightly by Eclipse, and sorely disappointed by Breaking Dawn.    I predicted everything fore coming in chapters ahead.  My hopes would rise then fall suddenly when eagerness for something spectacular to happen failed me.  I constantly hoped my predictions would be wrong, but I was constantly mistaken.    I gave the book my three-star rating versus a lower rating, simply because of Jacob.  I was ecstatic to find Jacob's \\"book\\" and found it hard to put the book down.  If Meyer's wrote an entire book based on Jacob, I'd be the first in line to buy it!    As I (along with many others) hoped the conclusion to this series would be what it should've, it was not nearly as strong as I hoped and anticipated.  Where was the big fight?  Death?  Sacrifice?  I felt I was put into a state of serenity by the time I reached the climax.    Although I was disappointed by Breaking Dawn, I wouldn't cast it aside as the entire Twilight saga has engulfed me.  I'm sure to read these books time and time again.
0545101417|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games and was one of the first in my \\"literary circle\\" to read it. I knew it would be  successful because it is so different from any young adult novels I've read in the past few years.  I was very anxious for Catching Fire to be released.  It was not a disappointment.  Although the novelty of the plot was not so shocking, I enjoyed Catching Fire tremendously.  I couldn't wait to be back with Peeta and Katniss once again.  The downside is...the third book isn't out yet!  I am prediciting there will be a movie.
1906694184|5.0|Read the first book of Larsson's (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) in his trilogy and now into the 2nd.  Excellent storyteller. Even when you put the book down you are still thinking about it.  Wonderful read.  I would suggest it to anyone who likes suspense and intelligent mysteries.  Not your run-of-the-mill crime drama.  Exceptional!
B002EEY8LC|5.0|I want buy it few years ago.  The picture and sound is very good.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|The movie started fine but the middle  was so cheesey and lame that I actually got up from watching it with my kids to go cook dinner. So I did not review the end. The main character might be a heartthrob to young females, and I am not hating on the guy but he cannot act. He did fine in Coach Carter but this movie sucked and he did not help matters by starring in this crap. I'm suprised at Dennis Quaid. He is a fine actor that has been in alot of good movies but lately he's been in a slump. 1st the horror flick Horseman, now this crap. I'm sorry this movie was good for children between the ages 7 and 11. Thats it.
B000003C2U|5.0|Where to start with this album, as I am listening to it as I write this, I neglected to buy this album for a while because it's only 34 minutes, but one day, I decided I wanted to finish off my Death collection, and picked it up, plain and simple, some of the best 34 minutes of my life happened the first time I listened to it.<br /><br />Now death was known for their lineup changes, there wasn't one album that had the exact same lineup as the former album, so Chuck liked to mix it up a bit, which is how you keep fans interested, because every album they did, was different, they never released the same album twice, which some bands can pull off, and still kick ass, but some just can't, but Death always managed to keep it fresh.<br /><br />And I do agree with one of the other reviewers, Sean Reinert seems to never get mentioned, and that angers me a bit, I mean we all know how special Chuck was, no mistake there, but Reinerts drumming on this album is just insane, he kicks the doublebass, but still manages to keep it non-repetitive, and throws some nice grooves/fills in, just a great drummer, needs more recognition.<br /><br />Some complain about the production, why?!, I think this is the way death metal should sound, and it's not absolute crap production, I do not want over the top production for my death metal, it just sounds better a bit muddy/raw.<br /><br />Best songs: Flattening of Emotions, Together As One, Secret Face, Lack of Comprehension<br /><br />But all the songs are good, no filler to be found here, Death never had filler as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are a death metal head, this album needs to be gotten, it'll be some of the best $15.00 you ever spent.<br /><br />And if you like this, I would suggest the previous album 'Spiritual Healing' and the following album 'Individual Thought Patterns', those 3 album you can really hear Death evolve, going from 'Leprosy' (the album before Spiritual Healing) you can hear them progress, and going from Spiritual Healing to this album, you hear it even more, and the progression goes on from there.<br /><br />I would suggest this album to those who want to venture out and get into death metal...or this band in general.
B000WMEAKC|1.0|Their music is good, very good. I like the group! The CD is a very poor release no better than a garage mix same as CD Baby kind of quality or itunes.. I hope \\"one rep\\" fines better sound engineers and more money and re-releases these great tunes. I am very disappointed in this release. I wasted my money and gave CD to thrift store.  Oh well..............
B002ELM5HY|5.0|I will pre-order and buy a new Mark Knopfler album any day! He writes like Dylan, plays guitar like Clapton (different style, but you get the idea), and his compositions keep getting better and better, especially in the good company of the likes of Guy Fletcher and Richard Bennett.<br /><br /> \\"Get Luck\\" was not love at-first-listen for me, but it has really grown on me over time. I likened it to Ragpicker's Dream,\\" a bit slow for my tastes. My wife, on the other hand, liked it a lot from the start, and after several times listening, I grew to like it more, and I dug out the song lyrics. After that - I loved it to the point that I would now rate it as my favorite album of 2009!<br /><br />The disc has not been out of our 5-disc player since it arrived more than a month ago. I actually like every song on the album, but my personal favorites are \\"Monteleone,\\" \\"The Car was the One,\\" and the title track. \\"Monteleone\\" is beautifully assembled. A \\"gear-head,\\" Mark has written two of the best songs about racing I know, \\"Nazareth\\" and now this. The title track \\"Get Luck\\" is a beautiful, upbeat ballad - and it is my current favorite!<br /><br />I hear just the slightest-bit of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"April Comes She Will\\" in certain parts of the melody of \\"Remembrance Day.\\" I like it!<br /><br />The orchestration sets this album apart for me. Sure, I love screaming guitars and intricate solos, but that's another album. It's the arrangements that make this collection special for me. I think that Guy Fletcher had a lot to do with that aspect of this album, and I hope that there will be STRINGS that accompany the band on their spring North American tour. I am looking forward to hearing Mark and his band play the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, a fantastic, perfectly renovated venue.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Not the best from Pixar but head and shoulders above Cars & Wall-E sorry but characters must have a pulse for me to have any interest in them. The Carl an Ellie story is touching once past that I think kids will get a kick out of it more than most adults. In Blu the animation as usual from Pixar is beautiful the short from Pixar and extras that came in the 4 disk set helped make the 20 bucks well worth it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I'm not an aficionado on animated films and, truth be told, I rarely watch them. With that said, I have not seen every Pixar film, but I can tell you there's never been one I didn't like. Whenever I end up watching one I'm stunned at how many levels it succeeds on as a motion picture and it's probably not a bold statement to imply that Pixar is the most consistently reliable animation studio.     The film's opening is an achievement in the animated medium simply for the emotional response it evokes from it's viewers with stark simplicity. Carl Fredericksen and Ellie meet as children, brought together by their mutual yearning for adventure. The story of their entire relationship concluding with her death is told using no words and is handled more poignantly than it would have been in many live-action films. Carl (now voiced by Ed Asner), a balloon salesman, adjusts to life without Ellie wandering his home without purpose and frequently annoyed by the construction occurring right outside. After city officials decide to place Carl in a nursing home, he attaches a great number of balloons to his house and begins steering his floating house to Paradise Falls, a place Ellie and himself had for years dreamed of going. Of course, Russell, a young, naïve Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his \\"help a Senior citizen\\" badge is standing on the porch of the floating house.    The story picks up steam upon their landing, where they discover a rare bird (nick-named Kevin by Russell) that begins following them. Problem is there's a group of mysterious dogs with collars allowing them to speak tracking the bird. One of these dogs is Dug, a marvelous creation courtesy of Pixar. Dug, the comic relief of this film is an adorable, funny, sympathetic character in a film that already has more memorable characters than just about any film this year.    Up is such an impressive film. It uses none of the animated film-clichés; there is no adult innuendo, no clichéd, mass-produced characters. It's geared towards children, but will appeal to all audiences because it's really a quality film. It has truly human characters that are emotionally complex and funny. The fact that Pixar continues to create characters that are both human and sympathetic is more of an achievement in animation than 3D is.    With a beautifully vivid color palette and inspired voice work by Asner, Jordan Nagai (as Russell), Bob Peterson (as Dug), and Christopher Plummer (as the film's antagonist, you'll know about him when you see the film), Up is one of those films that makes it unfortunate the Academy has a Best Animated Film category. It will more than likely win this award come Oscar-time, but Up isn't just one of the best animated films of the year it's one of the best films of the year. It succeeds on so many levels that animated films should not and most live-action films do not. It's a great animated film, yes but also just a great film, period; A stunning achievement on all levels.    GRADE: A
0156027321|4.0|Adventure, family, excitement, religion, human boy, Bengal tiger... Yann Martel's Life of Pi possesses all of the qualities of a good castaway novel and a few unexpected as well. It encompasses moral differences, emotional traumas, physical injuries and religious ideals. The diversity of the content, the narrators, and the plot's basic essence serves up an interesting and unusual read with a sharp dash of curry.    Pi Patel's story is inspiring and horrifying all at once, the castaway Indian boy who worships God, Allah and Vishnu and crosses himself on his prayer rug, the zookeeper's son who grew up listening to the chirping, squawking, crowing, moaning, growling and barking of all manner of animals. When he was stranded on one of the only surviving lifeboats of a sunken Japanese ship and with an orangutan, a hyena, a wounded zebra and a Bengal tiger, no less, Pi had to rely on his faith in God to carry him safely forward.    My favorite part of the book actually had nothing to do with the shipwreck. Pi explained in the beginning of the novel his connection to three separate religions. He told the stories of his introduction to first Hinduism, then to Christianity and finally to Islam. I thought it was very interesting why he worships in the traditions of three very different religious backgrounds and how he became intrigued by and adopted into all three religions as well. One image that really stuck in my head was of Pi at his prayers at the mosque simply because it was described so beautifully.    Life of Pi is very unique even being from such a popular genre as that of the castaway. The main character, Pi, is constantly surprising and certainly unlike anyone you know or even most likely know of. The book focuses on human nature vs. human desires, with the added bonus of what the \\"dumb\\" animals of our planet feel about such things as well.    I would recommend Life of Pi to anyone looking for a good adventure novel. It doesn't have any romance or satire but it isfilled with allegory, excitement and double entendres of the academic variety. Life of Pi is unique and interesting, written for just about anyone!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I had seen maybe 2 previews of this movie and never paid much attention.  I bought it yesterday on a whim and LOVE IT!  I cant believe I missed out watching this at the theater.
B002TYZKIM|1.0|The major problem facing the producers of THIS IS IT is the dearth of any recent hits by Jackson, meaning the songs performed here are all very dated and fail to engage the audience in any meaningful manner.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|A good, funny movie. Good to see in a time when tv is all crime shows.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This arrived very fast & in perfect shape, brand new. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this movie! Thank you for such great service.

B00006DEFA|5.0|I'm going to assume that most everybody has seen this now classic film,  so I'll spare you a blow by blow of what happens because you already know  for the most part that it was based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  This movie recieved 8 Oscars in 1984 (including Best Picture), and the   principal actors Tom Hulce (Mozart) and F. Murray Abraham (Salieri)   both turned in brilliant performances.   This new director's cut replaces 20-minutes of extra footage which was cut  from the original theatrical edit, but to be honest, I can't tell you that it  really made a difference in the overall story...it was already excellent.  But at any rate, there are plenty of great special features on the second disc  for fans who like to get really in depth with the behind the scenes of film-making.  This product shows just great on my 40\\" HD 1080p Surround TV and the sound is crisp,  as if an orchestra had set up in my den and was playing the musical pieces in real time!  I would recommend this as an addition to your DVD collection of great films.
B0017HEX76|1.0|Most disappointed in the fact that it is not specified ANYWHERE in the item description that it is in Korean default!!!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|The movies of HP and the Books have never been the same, thought the first movie tried.  I have enjoyed the books immensely and always see the movies in the theater and by the DVD for home.  This movie is no different, though the kids acting is improving greatly.  Rupert Grist is quite good, really shows his talent.  I love that these kids are well behaved and mannerly during their interviews and when in public.  Now, if you really want authentic book theater, listen to the CD or download the book.  Jim Dale reads and manages to do most of the voices perfectly.  You will swear you have seen it in the movies.  Just enjoy the movie, it really is great in it's own right.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is amazing for young through older. It's not just about fighting, it's about what the people that were there went through, what they felt, and for those that made it back, how they deal with it even to this day.
0061719544|4.0|I am really enjoying this book! I have been a fan of Craig's late show (could CBS pull and NBC and move his up to 11:30?) so I was excited when I heard his story was coming out. I will be honest, the language might be too much for some, or the not so subtle way he talks about sex, but if those don't deter you, you really should pick this up.    After reading some other reviews I have come to find people thought this was going to be just another funny book. It is actually very touching and thought provoking at times, while ridiculous and rude throughout. Just as Craig's show can be. I love the tenderness with which he speaks when referring to his not perfect but trying parents and the love he has for America from the prologue on. But I have to say my favorite thing is that is reads like a journal, not some polished perfect memoir. There are raw emotions, juvenile thoughts, odd memories and over all it is very real. The way he remembers it, with limited edits so that you can better understand what is going on. Sometimes he gets bog down in detail but I think that adds to the imagery and color of his life.      Overall it is a very good read, without much preaching but plenty of laughs. I certainly would recommend   this book.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|This movie is incredibly funny.  I've watched it several times and every time I find a new line that I didn't catch before that cracks me up.  Love the performances also.  Great actors, great story-line.  Great for collectors.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|My review answers a simple question: is the Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo worth $20? Are you getting enough for your entertainment dollar? The answer is...yes.<br /><br />I say this with caution for two reasons. The first is that, while Snow White is inarguably a classic, the story's pacing is very, very slow. Children raised on Pixar films like [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles]], [[ASIN:B00005JM02 Finding Nemo]], [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars]] and [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]] might not share their parents' fondness for Snow White. To be fair, most entertainment from 1937 cannot help but show its age more than 70 years later.<br /><br />The second reason for my cautious endorsement is that most of the extra features included in this package are of greater interest to parents instead of their children. So, do not be surprised if your child asks to leave the room after the movie ends while you stay behind, watching the \\"Disney Through The Decades\\" featurette or Don Hahn's nearly seven-minute discussion about the film's exposure sheet.<br /><br />In summary, for your entertainment dollar, this is a good investment. Just do not be surprised if it takes repeat viewings (and a little more maturity) before your children call it one of their favorites. Rating: Five stars.
0385504225|5.0|Now, I am waiting impatiently for the movie! I hope Tom Hanks likes the scenario!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|The case and CD were like brand new....delivery was timely, and the price could not be beat.
0446615625|3.0|This is my first book by the author; I don't know how fast I will be to read another--maybe as fast as the plot in this book, which is as slow as a plodding camel.  The book was not bad after it picked up, but getting there was a struggle.  There are endless characters and subplots and trying to keep all of them straight through all the drawn out activity was tough.  I also balked at the anti American political commentary.  At first i was put off by the anti-heroes in the book but eventually came to like them, unrealistic as they are.<br /><br />However, once past the first couple hundred pages and I learned to suspend reality,  the plot picks up and becomes enjoyable, making it worth the initial struggle.  The many characters and subplots start to gel and the book becomes exciting.  Exciting but not believable.
B000002LMM|3.0|3 1/2<br /><br />Though sandwiched with a little too much finger-snapping detective repetition, esoteric ambiance bookends what would become one of modern sight and sound's most thrilling couples.
0385341008|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was truly sorry to come to the last page.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I LOVE it.  The songs are different than you might expect, but thoughtfully chosen and beautifully performed. It's peaceful - and peace is something I can use in big doses this time of year.
1416550542|5.0|A hugely entertaining fairy tale, enthralling, gripping, intricate, heart-breaking, couldn't put it down... did I miss anything?? I won't go into a description of the plot, that's already been done numerous times. I will agree that at first the change from one time to another is a bit confusing, but it only took me the first two or three times to make sure to look at the date at the beginning of each chapter to know at what point I was in the story. And I must say, the switching back and forth was part of what made it so entertaining - I think had it read like a story with a normal straight time line it would have lost a lot of it's charm, that little extra something that made it so special, at least for me. Each new chapter brings a different piece of the puzzle into place; I didn't feel that any part of any chapter was unnecessary, unimportant or extra, each built upon the previous. The characters were just wonderful. Such complication in emotion, all (tragically, maybe?) woven together, yet each very much an individual. I love a story who's end is not easily guessed. Although you may see how it must inevitably end, the details are marvelously surprising. I also LOVE the fact that there were no loose ends. Absolutely everything is researched, exposed, and explained. I must admit, this is my first Kate Morton book, but have instantly become a fan and look forward to devouring the next one. Well done, Ms. Morton, and THANK YOU for such a wonderful ride!
B0021L8UVC|3.0|This movie will get alot of bad reviews. The acting isn't the greatest and the story has some holes in it. The characters are also not developed enough. So you basically have no idea what there lives were like before they woke up 900 years into the future. With that being said, This movie is not a bad movie. It's actually one of the best action sci-fi films i've seen i a while. The fighting scenes are very intense and the space creatures are actually scary. They remind me of the creatures from the movie The Descent with shoulder pads on. You will not get bored watching this movie. I'm actually going to watch it again. I still have not figured out if the creatures are from space or not. They might actually be humans that have evolved over time. This was said in the movie. So go ahead and rent this one. It's not the best movie ever but it definately delivers as a Intense Action Flick. Holla!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This is a lovely album. Beautiful traditional and new songs played on wonderful acoustic instuments. This is a new favorite of mine. I believe you'll enjoy it too. Peace...
0312383436|4.0|I'm not usually drawn toward wedding books, but I'm a big Sophie Kinsella/Madeleine Wickham fan so I gave this a shot. This is not your typical wedding story; the first wedding takes place when Milly is only 18, and it's on a lark, as a favor to a gay friend who needs to be married to stay in the country. She forgets about it and goes on to live a very non-lark-y life...except for the fact that her fianc&eacute; thinks she's more erudite than she is.<br /><br />What ensues is much familial havoc, including Milly's parents' unhappiness and her sister's unexpected pregnancy, not to mention a meddling wedding photographer and godmother. There is a lot going on and sometimes it's distracting, and I found the ending a little too neat, but like with her other work, I enjoyed Milly's predicament and that she stands up for herself and that Wickham manages to skewer wedding culture just a little bit as well. Milly is not the typical bride and even though she has dreams of a traditional marriage, she finds herself having to remake all of her relationships and discovering that many people, even those closest to her, aren't what they seem. While the gay characters could've had a happier ending, I still appreciated that Wickham included that story line and made them more than just a plot device for Milly. Bisexuality is never actually addressed but is lurking in Rupert's character (Rupert is the ex of the man Milly married) as he too struggles between a traditional life and a less traditional one.
B000ZELISO|4.0|Seems like this movie has quite the love-hate relationship going on with it's fans. I hadn't really thought of all the parts they'd taken out, I will say that for every scene they took out, there's another in that _was_ in the book. So in my mind, they couldn't have it all, and it came down to weighing which ones to keep in.    With regards to the two scenes that are causing the most controversy, the burning of the barrows and the waitress scenes, I'm willing to look past. It's a movie, and it's playing towards a movie audience, whether they read the book or not, and these two scenes are overly dramatic/cute as such.    For me, a Harry Potter fan who has only gone through the book(s) once, it was a fun experience. I will say Lavender made me cringe a few times, but I feel like that was the point!     They're splitting the last book into two movies, which really it could fill up by itself easily, but here's hoping they catch us up on some stuff from the last book while they're at it.    So, unless you're an unforgiving stickler for details, you'll probably enjoy this.
B001FXCE46|5.0|Kings of Leon had slowly gathered a pretty dedicated following with their previous releases; Youth & Young Manhood, Aha Shake Heartbreak and Because of the Times, and rightly so. The music rocked, the lyrics were at times juvenile but Caleb's voice has an aged quality to it that makes even the dumbest lyrics sound plausible. I was leery of Only By the Night because everyone described it as a much more \\"polished\\" album, and when I think of KOL, I don't want to think of polished. Later, after hearing their first single, Sex On Fire, I was very disappointed. However, this album as a whole is amazing. It is full of what you have come to expect from a KOL album, namely catchy guitar hooks, great singing and some pretty dumb lyrics (Sex on Fire being the prime example). The standouts of this album have to be \\"Be Somebody\\", \\"17\\" and \\"Notion\\". They are not as rockin' as earlier Kings songs but they are definitely catchy and Caleb's voice sounds as strong and soulful here as it ever has. If you like Kings Of Leon, buy this album, and listen to it a couple times. You'll realize that it more than equals their earlier works. Can't wait to hear what they do next.

0316001821|4.0|It was an attention grabber on the first page when the reader is advised that the main character is telling the story from her Heaven.  That situation makes the story interesting as she learns about relationships that she wasn't able to understand while she was alive.  It was an interesting read because of that perspective, but was maybe overwritten a bit.  As each relationship is defined and settled it unnecessarily bleeds into the next character's story causing a little confusion.
0882709194|5.0|Its an Excellent and thought provoking introduction to Darwin's book. I dont understand all the negativity.If evolution is indisputable evidence , then why be afraid of a Christian perspective .Ray Comfort presents a compelling argument. I never thought I would see the day when atheists such as Dr Richard Dawkins would be in favor of destroying a book just because he disagrees with it. Dont be afraid, read the intro, you just might learn something.
0385504225|1.0|I honestly don't understand why this book isn't getting even worse reviews than it is. I thought Dan Brown's DaVinci Code was okay, and I enjoyed Angels and Demons (I haven't seen either of the movies because I prefer the depth of a novel). So I was looking forward to his latest book, The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />What a disappointment. I bought the hardcover for my wife, but I listened to the audio book. Eventually the only way I was able to get through all of its lectures and utter nonsense was on double speed on my iPhone.<br /><br />In trying to think how to describe the book's problems, I found it hard to come up with anything I liked about it. What I did come up with was a list:<br /><br />How to Write Like Dan Brown<br /><br />  1. Start with an idea for a 20 page short story.<br />  2. Turn it into a novel.<br />  3. Label every scene as a chapter.<br />  4. Use the viewpoint of every living thing in Washington (don't overlook bums, pets and inanimate objects as possibilities).<br />  5. Describe everything at least 5 times.<br />  6. End each of the two hundred chapters with a melodramatic cliff hanger.<br />  7. Recap the entire situation at the beginning of every chapter.<br />  8. Stop in the middle of all action sequences for a five page lecture.<br />  9. Hire Wile E. Coyote as your science adviser.<br />  10. Sell the movie rights for $10M.<br /><br />That last one is the one that bugs me the most. With all the terrific books out there, it's sad that this one is certain to be turned into a movie, and make more money that all of this year's best sellers combined. The book is actually already written like a movie script, more a collection of dramatic beats than a real story. You can almost here the DUN DUN DUN at the end of each of the 136 chapters.<br /><br />If you insist on finding out how bad The Lost Symbol is for yourself, at least wait until you can pick up a used copy for 1 cent. There will be lots of them.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|If a bearded man breaks wind in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?  Well, apparently, it not only makes a sound, it magically gets recorded and distributed en masse!    But seriously, folks...in spite of the fact that this is a somber piece of music that could easily be the soundtrack for a snowy/chilly evening in some poorly insulated cabin, with a cruel and restless wind howling at your door and clutching at your long-johns with its icy, gnarled fingers, I like it well enough.  It's a good companion piece to the music of John Dowland cd which came out a few years ago.  Apparently Sting is continuing down the same artistic path to see what else is there.      Almost invariably, when you put your trust into an artist's work he/she WILL lead you down a poorly lit corridor with no visible means of escape from time to time.  I applaud the fact that he is in the twilight of his career and yet he's still taking chances.  He never said this was a \\"Christmas Album\\" per se, so I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with the outcome really.  The cover photo says it all: bleak, isolated, somber, melancholy, cold and wet.    Sidenote:  Other possible titles for this review were-  \\"The King of Pain Strikes Again\\", \\"Sting Turns Saint Nick's Face To Alabaster\\", \\"It's A Big Enough Umbrella, But Somehow Everyone Gets Wet\\", \\"We Strain To Understand Him, We Chase His Thoughts Like Birds\\", \\"Sting Really Takes The Biscuit\\", \\"Christmas Is So Happy, We Can't Stop Crying\\", \\"Sting Woke Up In His Clothes Again This Morning\\", \\"Maybe the Sun IS Invisible After All...\\".    2nd Sidenote: Check out an \\"Anonymous 4\\" album for some good medieval harmonies & chants.  I would agree with Sting that there are some ideas from that time period worth mining, but the challenge is to create a contemporary edge that would appeal to the modern listener-a daunting task.     Further suggestions: Check out the song \\"Silence\\" by Delerium & Sarah McLachlan.  This is a nice blend of electronica/techno and medieval shadings-an example of what this type of artistic exploration CAN yield when executed properly.
B001TODCII|4.0|Neeson is excellent as a government operative who is divorced and is still trying to make amends to his teenage daughter for not being there for her during many of her formative years.  He is very protective for her because of his training Thus he is extremely adverse to his daughter going with a friend to Paris for a vacation.    At first he totally refuses to give her permission but is pressure by both his daughter and ex-wife to sign the permission slip.  Of course the actual plans that the daughter has once she gets there is different.  She and her girlfriend let a stranger ride with them in a cab from the airport and it leads to a bunch of men breaking into the apartment where she is staying.    The daughter manages to call her father as the men break in and her tells her what is going to happen but if she follows his instructions, he will hopefully be able to find her.  The men take both girls and one actually taunts Neeson on the phone.  Neeson promises the attacker that he will track him down and kill him.    Neeson then dons a \\"Jason Bourne\\" personna and goes to Paris to find his daughter.  He is in a desperate race against the clock because that he is told that if he doesn't find her in 96 hours, it will be impossible to ever locate her.    Great action scenes and Neeson is relentless in his chase.  Though this movie has a lot of predictability it is still fun and Neeson does a good job playing his part.  An above average thriller!

B002BNKQDK|5.0|This item varies in price. I picked it up when it was $75. I read the comic when it first came out, and still feel the movie is better. No giant squid and the outcome carries so much more impact. Not that the comic was bad, it was an incredible diversion from the usual, but in a day and age where everyone ups the antie, kicks things up a notch, this movie accomplished just that.<br /><br />Okay, I won't go into spoilers.<br /><br />I know what you are thinking, \\"The Niv, why would I spend seventy five cabbages on something I can get for $20...with a game?\\" Well true believer, the answer is simple, Archie. Yes, there are hours of video extras and a digital copy of the movie included with this package, but really, this movie should have been entitled, \\"Archie.\\" The Owl Ship rocks. Yeah, there's an all-powerful blue guy and someone who can catch bullets, but Archie is it; all that and a picnic basket, a bag of chips while supermodels are feeding you grapes picked freshly off pesticide-free gardens from a mountain top. If you liked Watchmen, if your mouth dropped open when you first saw the trailer for the movie, then this is a wonderful addition to your collection.<br />Now I am off to watch it again, hoping this time Rorshack doesn't die.

Billie Jean was the song, and its performance showed the world that limitation was all in the mind, and that one man can express magic ubiquitously.

Videos meant that you could see a beat, you could see the singer in his anguish, joy or success, just as he/she felt at the moment of the music's cenception.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|I love action flicks and was really, really looking forward to this movie. Very close to being a total dud, but I admit it just kept my interest enough to finish watching it.  To add insult to injury, even Dennis Quaid was more a cameo role and phoned it in, and Sienna Miller was horribly miscast in it :(

B0025KVLUQ|1.0|Most definitely don't bother with the remastered version(S) they have vocals on one side of the room and the music on the other.  Unless your stereo has the ability to combine both, do buy the mono, or origional stereo if available!!
B00125WAWS|5.0|The Great Debaters is a wonderfully acted, well produced film about the first college debate between a black team, Wiley College, and a white team. (In the movie, the white team is Harvard, but in fact it was USC.) The plot of the movie revolves around the struggles of the debating team to achieve recognition during an era in which civil rights were a mere glimmer on their progenitors' eyes. (Not surprisingly, several of those progenitors were members of the debating team.) The outcome is predictable, so in that sense, this is a \\"feel-good\\" film. But the purpose of the film wasn't just to make us root for the underdog. The Great Debaters was clearly intended as a vehicle to portray the origins of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />The movie makes some departures from historical events, but these were not of a nature to detract from the story. Where the final debate took place is not particularly important. What is important is that the film accurately depicted the hurdles faced by the black community in the 1930s. This was an era in which \\"justice\\" was often administered at the end of a rope, and in which being black was a crime in and of itself. The horrifying scene in which James Farmer, Jr. (who eventually became one of the \\"Big Four\\" of the civil rights movement), witnesses a lynching encapsulated the purpose of this film, which was to explain the need for civil rights. The debates, themselves, while probably departing significantly from the originals, served to present the arguments used by later civil rights advocates, notably Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />Unlike many films based on \\"true stories\\" the Great Debaters tackled the larger social issues of the times. Because these issues--the rights of minorities, the rule of law, constitutional authority--are still pertinent, still subject to heated discussion, and still worthy of our undivided attention, the great debate continues.
B001U887WE|4.0|I ordered one size bigger following the advice from other people's reviews. It could be that the other kind of crocs run smaller but this particular one is true to size!

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|If you are reading this you likely already have the first season blu-ray and this one is more of the same excellent quality. The transfers are superb - almost too good, sometimes, as it is easy to see when a stunt double is used instead of Shartner / Nimoy etc! I was often amazed I was looking at something over 40 years old with the high picture quality in almost every shot.<br /><br />I thought before seeing the first set that I would be a 'purist' and hate the re-done effects but to my surprise I find they add to the show rather than detract from it. All the effects are done in the exact style of the originals - it's more like you are seeing more detail than a new effect in most cases. For example, the 'hand' effect in \\"Who Mourns for Adonais\\" from this set looks nearly identical at first glance, though it is coming up from the surface of the planet rather than just out in the middle of nowhere. As it gets closer, you can see that it is an undulating energy field shaped like a hand. I suspect if it had been technically possible to do it that way and stay in budget in the 60s this is the way they would have done it. All the effects are done this way, they don't look like transplanted effects from Star Wars Clone Wars or even Star Trek TNG. It is obvious to me that the creators of the new effects share a fan's love for the original show and their efforts have paid off. On the other hand, if you prefer the original effects they are there. If you want to annoy anyone else in the room, you can even switch back and forth, hitting replay to compare them.<br /><br />If by any chance you are not familiar with the series, this is certainly the way to watch it. It is one of the most ahead-of-its-time series ever made and IMHO remains the best of all the ST series. The first season is generally considered the best but looking over Season Two this is really where ST hits its stride; you can see that the relationships established in the first season are much more fleshed out here. Even among the much-maligned third season there are some gems to go along with turkeys like \\"Spock's Brain\\" and \\"Turnabout Intruder\\". But I'm getting ahead of myself, season three will come out in December, so Paramount can get another $50 or so from me and maybe I'll review that one as well.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a great set and well worth the money for any fan of ST.he much-maligned third season there are some gems to go along with turkeys like \\"Spock's Brain\\" and \\"Turnabout Intruder\\".

B000FIMG68|4.0|I didn't enjoy the Second Season quite as much as the first.  However, I still find it to be a riveting television show.<br /><br />I think some of my dislike of Season Two was simply the \\"soap opera\\" like qualities in it. For instance, someone would ask another person a burning question that every watcher wants to know, then the other person would just stare at them. Sometimes the person had to ask again to get an answer or the scene might switch to some more backstory, or worse, switch to another scene entirely. It's hard for me to imagine someone asking another person a question, then sitting there watching them zone out for several minutes. I think they woudl start to wonder if the person was on drugs.<br /><br />This sort of thing did happen in Season One, it was just not so prevalent there.<br /><br />Overall, though, I love the imagination shown by the writers. This is just an excellent show!
0743298039|4.0|I'd heard good things about this book, and, after my mother insisted I read it, I finally gave in.  I'm happy to report that The Thirteenth Tale was indeed a fantastic read.<br /><br />I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first.  A book about a culture's greatest writer is dangerous ground, for what if the character of the greatest writer is badly written?  But, Setterfield pulled it off nicely.  Setterfield also blended well-written, formal language with believable dialogue in such a way that it was very pleasant to read.  In fact, she straddled the line between good description and over-indulgence to the point I was afraid she would teeter over the edge, losing me forever, but she kept her imagery pertinent and never veered off into ramblings.  Her myriad allusions, thorough characterization, and complicated, rewarding plot made The Thirteenth Tale a fast, enjoyable experience.<br /><br />The story itself has the makings of a classic.  Vida Winter, England's greatest writer, is about to die from natural causes and she wants her story taken down by an amateur biographer, Margaret Lea.  A mystery soon emerges as Lea listens to Winter's tale and she must piece together a tapestry that discerns fact from fiction.  A tale of incest, fire, death, ghosts, and trickery ensues, all while Lea is struggling with her own inner demons.<br /><br />Personally, I found the climax and resolution rewarding and consistent with the rest of the book.  Some feel that Setterfield left things too ambiguous, but I think the reader must take an active part in the story and make up his or her own mind.  I don't mind a little elusiveness in a story such as this.  I especially appreciated that many details Setterfield included early on in the novel played an important role as the mystery unveiled.<br /><br />I think you'll find The Thirteenth Tale both a well-crafted novel by a capable author and a flat-out exciting story.  Enjoy.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant
0385504225|3.0|WARNING: SOME SPOILERS ****** I thought this one was 'okay.' The Robert Langdon character, unfortunately, really started to bug me. I actually thought after the supposed *demise* that the author was planning to shift his series to a new character like Katherine Solomon. Ha. Fool me once...I was slightly disappointed, however, when said demise was a ruse. The symbol explanations were cool, as were the descriptions of DC locales (until I read the posts on how inaccurate they were...grrrr). Overall, it was okay, makes me want to visit DC, but doubtful I'll read it again.
B000002H97|5.0|Sometimes the most meaningful truths can be expressed in the simplest words and one such sentence can affect and change the lives of millions. The message of Nothing Else Matters is straight forward: Be your own man, live your life however you choose and allow others the same. The message of The Unforgiven is: Don't let the rules of bitter fools change you into one of them.<br />Although I don't listen to Metallica albums and I am not sure how much we could have in common besides sharing our superstar city, once I heard Nothing Else Matters I was blown away by the power of their expression coming through. The Unforgiven is another beautiful song on this album. I am sure there is much more great music here but the speed of those expressions exceeds my ability to follow it correctly...these days. Obviously I could listen to the music of Metallica and Iron Maiden and Judast Priest for a week and be completely in tune with it and hooked on it again. Let's just say that it would collide with my present life style too much. I am quite aware that all of the above music rules its territory and I used to spend time there. After listening to Nothing Else Matters and The Unforgiven for a while I ended up getting all the Metallica albums in the middle of 1990s, looking for jewels. I ended up making my Metallica- light compilation putting all these mellow, emotional and spiritual songs (for them and for most of you guys most likely) together so myself and some other sissies like me can say they also listen to Metallica. I am giving this Black Album (1991) five stars for Nothing Else Matters and The Unforgiven alone. So, here are my favorite songs of lighter Metallica: Nothing Else Matters, Turn The Page, The Unforgiven, Low Man's Lyric, Bleeding Me, Fade To Black, Untill It Sleeps, Whiskey In The Jar, The Unforgiven 2, Mama Said, Astronomy.

B00000I3JO|5.0|When you hear The Downtown Lights for the first time you won't be able to believe that this music has been around for over 20 years and you where not aware of it. Some of you can actually recognize hearing a version of Let's Go Out Tonight from 1998 Craig Armstrong's release of The Space Between Us (a phenomenal electronica album). Paul sings on Craig's version as well. Blue Nile has been around for close to 30 years. The band was officially started in 1981 by three students of Glasgow University. Their first album Walk Across The Rooftops was finally released in 1983 and got quite some recognition. Hats, their second album and in my view their best by far was not released until 1989. As you can imagine, over 5 years distance makes making it in music quite difficult. Blue Nile was very consistent in their...delay. Their 3rd album Peace At Last was not released until 1996 and their latest 4th album High in 2004. Four albums in 23 years of consistent music making... The reason for such randomness is the fact that making music is one and not the most important field of this band members' life on earth, plus their internal quality control preventing many songs from release. Personally I respect such attitude and process. Regardless, the album I am reviewing, Hats is beautiful throughout, with one exception. No need to listen to it 7 times to get there. You will know it right away. This is rather soft emotional rock music with the beautiful atmospheric mood hanging over it. For some this album could become one of the most beautiful mellow and even albums they will ever hear. For whatever reasons, I guess the charm, depth and emotion of the vocal being one of them and the fullness and tenderness of music being the other, I feel some slight similarities with Talk Talk's - The Colour Of Spring, one of the most amazing albums I know. Music is not as full and developed but the mood left behind is similar. Blue Nile's Hats (unlike Colour Of Spring), because it is so constant in its approach, can get a bit...long after the 4th  song, so I don't listen to it from beginning to end very often. It is much better to either listen to first 3 or 4 songs, break it up with something else and then go back to the remaining 3. It is even better to use these songs in your playlists (5 discs of various moods loaded into my cd changer is my usual playlist).<br /> Paul Buchanan's voice is often compared to voice of Peter Gabriel, who by the way belongs to the Blue Nile Fan Club. Another vocalist I would compare him to is Stuart Staples, so any Tindersticks fans should listen to this album as well. My feeling is that even greater respect to Paul Buchanan and the music of Blue Nile than the one by Craig Armstrong, was paid in 2005 by Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead and by their Weird Fishes/Arpeggi first performed by them at that time, and the following release of that song on their In Rainbows album in 2007. This is arguably the most beautiful song of In Rainbows (main 10 song cd, but perhaps not the 18 song entire double album, where Go Down can compete with it). It is a gorgeous song and if you do like the way Thom sings it, please listen carefully to Blue Nile's Hats and especially The Downtown Lights about 5 minutes down the song... There are many beautiful songs here. I guess my least favorite is song #4 Headlights On The Parade, and I wish it was not included because it does lower the quality of this beautiful album. My favorite songs are The Downtown Lights with its amazing ending, Over The Hillside, Let's Go Out Tonight, From A Late Night Train. If these are the only songs you like, of even if you only like the first 3 songs, they are worth your effort adn the price of this album. If you do like this album, definitely head to their earlier one next.n its approach, can get a bit...long after the 4th  song, so I don't listen to it from beginning to end very often.

It is a gorgeous song and if you do like the way Thom sings it, please listen carefully to Blue Nile's Hats and especially The Downtown Lights about 5 minutes down the song... There are many beautiful songs here. I guess my least favorite is song #4 Headlights On The Parade, and I wish it was not included because it does lower the quality of this beautiful album. My favorite songs are The Downtown Lights with its amazing ending, Over The Hillside, Let's Go Out Tonight, From A Late Night Train. If these are the only songs you like, of even if you only like the first 3 songs, they are worth your effort adn the price of this album. If you do like this album, definitely head to their earlier one next.
B000007489|5.0|First time I heard this album, i just got pissed of what became of punk or mostly all of todays hardcore. Because this album is so damn good it is everything that real punk was about. You get some guitar solos? back in the day that was still unheard of in hardcore, i think. Institutionalized was every punk fans every day life, who knows about the pepsi tough. You got to love that song even if it's the band more popular tune, you just feel like screaming about everything that sucks in your life every time you hear it. Mike Muir also shows some of his singing in one of the songs which was still pretty hardcore. And there's a riff similar to Black sabbath in one of the tracks, you will notice it in a instant but as soon as you can say war pigs, you're suddenly into hardcore greatness. This album is a MUST for any true hardcore or metal fan. It cross boundaries like other bands at that time didn't. After this masterpiece, they crossover to thrash metal and since i wasn't really a thrash fan except for maybe Slayer, i disliked everything they did after their debut. But since thrash metal got it's help from early hardcore punk, then what was the better music to mosh to right? there's nothing like old thrash and old punk, so both sides are the best music to get caught in a mosh. Unlike scene kids today who stand still while the other (I'm so hardcore man) kids dance like girls In a laughable \\"pit\\", because they're avoiding to get hurt. I may not like Suicidal tendencies in person (the gang attitudes i guess) but they make some bad @ss hardcore. They are also underrated as a thrash band but also in punk (for hardcocre fans, we know what kind of punk). So either Join the army or buy this. Ha!

B000056NX5|2.0|As a lifetime fan of Jesus Christ Superstar who has opened his mind to many interpretations of this story, and of the music, I must say that Jesus Christ Superstar 2000 is perhaps my least favorite \\"professional\\" production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's classic rock-opera.  Perhaps I am biased from being raised on the 70s film starring Ted Neely in the role of Christ, and Carl Anderson as Judas, but I honestly don't think that I am biased, even having heard Neely live, for I have accepted many other recordings.  The cast of 2000 is just not right!  It is flawed in many, many ways.<br /><br />For starters I'm going to do presentation.  The entire film is set in essential the same sets, which I have no problem with, seeing as I'm a proud fan of theater.  My problem is not the sets, but the entire art design of this production.  What I do have a problem with is that this production destroys what the best productions had aimed for, which was finding common ground for ALL audiences.  One major appeal of the 1970s film was that they tried to not discriminate against the Romans, or the Jewish leaders; it was very open, and fair in its portrayals, even adding a song to Caiaphas and Annas to show that their reaction to Jesus' popularity wasn't of spite, but of fear (which, given the time, is COMPLETELY understandable).  In this production the Jewish leaders are portrayed as evil, and I'm not Jewish, but this just is low, because anyone who has studied history should know that the reaction to Jesus was completely natural; no one wanted a rabble rouser to start a problem...because that would mean the Roman army would come back.  Also, every character in this production - even the lepers - all look GREAT, as in fine specimens of the human race.<br /><br />Getting around to the performers; Glen Carter leads the cast and as Jesus falls short in every regard.  He seems to have come for a church choir audition oblivious to the fact that this is a ROCK (key word being ROCK) opera.  His soft, mellow voice is not fit for the role in the slightest.  Even worse is the fact that he just isn't at all convincing in the role.  Take away Ted Neely's beard and long hair in the original film and he STILL gave a convincing performance in the role; the intensity in his eyes as if he knew something was great and he radiated a strong presence.  Glen Carter has no such aura.<br /><br />J&eacute;rôme Pradon is the real problem with this production.  His scratchy voice is not at all fitting for the role of Judas, who is actually SUPPOSED to be the real star of this musical.  This musical is mainly from Judas' perspective, and he is supposed to be a sympathetic character whose path has been set by God and he can't change it.  2000's portrayal returns the nihilistic interpretation where Judas is shown as nothing more that a schemer, and given the way Pradon sings the part it's obvious they wanted the most snake-like voice they could find when casting.  Whoever lead the production seems oblivious the fact that this musical's point was to show Judas in a human light.<br /><br />In all there are a few good numbers in here, but nothing that really stands out.  What I remember most is just how dumbed down they've made the story.  For the flogging here there is more blood than the original film, but no where near as brutal (they have people SLAP him in this one...SLAPPING!).  They've turned a musical that shows the complex, human aspects of these historic figures and turned it into a simple \\"Good and Evil\\" story.  In one line they even have Annas say \\"Is that it for the Jewish dream?\\" in a maniacal tone while Jesus is taken to trial...isn't' Annas SUPPOSED TO BE JEWISH?!  The logic of this lyric particularly has me baffled because people into history should know that the Jewish leaders acted on what they believed to be their best interest, not to destroy their own dreams.  So its little things like this that make an otherwise stylish production lose all valuewith me as a fan of the musical.<br /><br />I guess this version is meant for the more traditional Christians than the original, but at that price it totally ostracizes anyone outside the Christian faith.  As a Christian, and a fan of this musical, I was not at all impressed by this production.  Numbers that should have rocked the house such as Heaven On Their Minds, Gethsemane, and Superstar fall horribly flat while the only good numbers are small ones such as Pilate And Christ, Jesus Must Die, Simon Zealotes, and Peter's Denial.  This is the most forgettable version of the musical I have ever seen and I recommend you sticking with the original which is a thought provoking, timeless classic with rocking tunes and performers with sheer talent.<br /><br />P.S. Pretty arrogant of Andrew Lloyd Webber to have them title it \\"Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar 2000\\" when fans should know that the story concept, and lyrics were written and conceived by Tim Rice.l.

0316017922|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's previous two books (The Tipping Point and Blink), and I found neither convincing in its central thesis. Gladwell has a flare for making psychology and social psychology research easily digestible and interweaving it with case studies to provide a satisfying mix that is inherently interesting, high entertainment value, and insightful into how we behave. That said, in neither of the previous books did I find that this tapestry of experiments and case studies really convinced me of the central thesis.    The thesis of this newer book is that people who are exceptionally successful - outliers - are a product of their environments much more than they are individually exceptional. First, Gladwell keeps knocking down a straw man that no one really believes anyway. I think we all know that environment matters a lot, and Gladwell never really accounts for the individual elements. Yes, the Beattles got 10,000 hours to practice in Hamburg, but were there other bands that played in Hamburg every year but didn't go big? Yes, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were born at a special time and had a special set of privileges, but what about Bill Gates's friends in his same high school computer club? What computer empire did they create? In other words, the individual element which Gladwell seems so excited to downplay still has to play a major role; or at least, Gladwell hasn't convinced me that it doesn't.    The most interesting part of the book deals with air plane crashes because it goes back to Gladwell's successful formula: a mix of social science research (in this case, on cross-cultural hierarchy something something) and case studies - of major plane crashes.    Gladwell still tells a good story, but this one is much less convincing than his previous work.  I listened to the unabridged audiobook, and Gladwell narrates well.  At the end of the audiobook, there is an interview with Gladwell which really belongs at the beginning; it gives an intro to thebook that is totally superfluous after having read it.    Note on content: There might be a swear word or two in here; and in the epilogue there is one description of slave treatment which is not pretty (but is historical), but otherwise this is innocuous sailing.
0740785508|5.0|Heftier in both pages and content than most \\"How to Draw\\" type books, Imaginative Realism delivers on some great art instruction.    I'd be hard pressed to think of this as the type of \\"How to\\" book it first appears to be, since there isn't any step-by-step instruction. It does however cover many basic aspects of art that standard books often miss.     The two largest areas this book covers are reference(such as using models or maquettes as guides) and composition which showed some very interesting tips I'd never seen before; like \\"Windmilling\\" which helps unify light and dark in a composition. Both are essential to the book's goal of making believable art of invented subjects.    This book also doubles as a retrospective of James Gurney's artwork with many sections centering on paintings he's done. Seeing practical examples of what he's teaching helps drive the concept home.    And of course since the author also created the Dinotopia series, a sizable portion of the book is dedicated to dinosaurs.    Something also missing in a lot of other drawing books, Gurney lays out several uses and careers for the skills he's teaching.    All in all, Imaginative Realism is a solid art book with great pictures and useful tips on artmaking, whether your subject exists in real life or not.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I listened to samples for the laughs, because Dylan doing Christmas songs?! That is just funny! But no, it's good, it's fresh. Here is Dylan, with his rough, been-through-it-all, bluesy voice, singing with all the hope, happiness, simplicity and optimism of the season.  And \\"Little Drummer Boy\\"? I've heard it too much, am tired of it. But Dylan--whoa. Makes me cry. As he sings it, he's been through bad times, but he still there, with faith and goodness in his heart.  I downloaded five of the songs, because I did find a couple funny, so I'll discuss only those songs. \\"The Christmas Blues\\" is something I'd never heard. It's good and well-suited to Dylan's voice.  The great classics are a revelation as Dylan sings them.  \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is sweet, simple, but with an added undercurrent of sadness and irony.  Maybe Dylan didn't mean it anyway, but it's just what comes out of him.  \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\"  provide a welcome new perspective on songs I've heard too many times.  THe backing singers pretty much stay out of the way, although the samples are a bit misleading as to their part. The \\"Must be Santa\\" sample is frenetic and has an accordion in it, so I didn't buy it, but it's good, the more I listen. Maybe I will download it!

0525951113|5.0|Suarez' cyberthriller \\"Daemon\\" blows away many other similar novels I've read in the genre.  Works by RJ Pineiro are in the same vein, and while they are entertaining reads, they are not up to the quality of this one.    Could a threat such as the events described in this novel happen?  It's doubtful, but you never know.  It was interesting to see some of the dynamics in play, such as the higher-ups in government being more concerned about the potential future value of their 401k than trying to address the issue of the daemon spreading.  \\"Kicking the can down the road\\" simply postpones the inevitable, but likely worsens the effects when it does occur and cannot be avoided.    The sequel is due to be released soon, and is one I'm anxiously awaiting.
B000001ELP|5.0|By this time in KISS's career, things were not going so well. Their last two albums really began alienating a lot of their long-time fans, including myself. Heck, I didn't even hear The Elder until almost twenty years after it's release.<br /><br />When it first came out back in the early eighties, I was too involved in giving other bands a try. I was not interested in getting burned again by another lame KISS album. Boy, did I ever eventually find out how wrong I was once I actually got around to listening to this great concept album!<br /><br />The album rocks pretty damn good throughout it's entirety, and it features many standout tracks such as Only You, Under The Rose, Dark Light, A World Without Heroes, The Oath, Mr. Blackwell, and I. In fact, the entire album is great from beginning to end.<br /><br />The only complaint I can give it is that it is too short. I want to hear more! It really should have been a double disc set like Judas Priest's recent and excellent Nostradamus themed concept album. KISS, you really outdid yourselves in every way with this awesome and touching concept album and I salute you.

B001AII4RM|2.0|If you appreciate the original tale of Beowulf, then this film doesn't add much and in fact is a poor version on multiple levels: story-wise and technically.  First off, Zemekis has taken way too much liberty with the source material (the portrayal of Grendel's mom and some other less needed story elements).  Beowulf's relations with Grendel's mom is very inaccurately portrayed, along with the final revelation in the film which is really not present in the original story.  In order to flesh out and pad a relatively straight forward story of a hero, Zemekis has managed to create a wasted opportunity with extraneous plot none-sense.    Beyond that, this film still suffers from the zombie-eye cg puppet syndrome ailing all of the director's motion captured films (though less creepy than the now famous Polar express).  The animation is very weak because relying too heavily on mocap info deadens the action.  Realistic portrayal of digital actors is still a work in progress, and it does this movie no favors.  Too bad, because despite it all the story of Beowulf could make an interesting film when done right.

I paid four bucks for mine at the video store -- it was pre-played and in like-new condition.<br /><br />The technical stuff is that this film/DVD IS in widescreen and runs for 114 minutes. The film is un-rated (IMDB has it at PG-13, mostly for some mild nudity and sexual scenes which aren't very graphic.) There has been a lot of digital enhancement of this film, particularly to punctuate the action scenes and this feature has been well-done throughout. You might characterize it as semi-animation but it's not cartooney in any way and looks very realistic.<br /><br />WARNING: MINOR SPOILER HEAD!<br /><br />THE STORY: The time is 507 A.D. where Beowulf is a mighty heroic and pagan warrior who comes to the aid of the King of Denmark whose kingdom is plagued with periodic raids by the demon-monster Grendel. Grendel, a pathetic and violent gigantic creature who has a taste for human flesh and blood, is soon dealt with by Beowulf but Grendel's \\"mother\\" is much more formidable and she's really ticked off that Beowulf snuffed her offspring. The final two-thirds of the film deals with that conflict as well as with Beowulf's mercenary exploits.<br /><br />This 2007 film is loosely based upon the anonymous epic poem (written sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries) of the same title. The story is considered very important to Anglo-Saxon literature. In both the poem and the film Beowulf overcomes various mythical creatures which threaten humanity.<br /><br />I first saw this film, having borrowed the DVD from the local public library -- this was an inferior version, rendered in full-screen which I do not recommend.

B002QEISMA|5.0|It seems like every prog release automatically gets 4-5 stars on Amazon, so it's difficult to figure out which ones are for real. This one is. This is such a good CD and I've come to appreciate it as having three distinct energy levels. First there is the almost constant energy of the bass and percussion that reflect the restlessness and pace described in the lyrics. Then there's a very nice ebb and flow in each song...I almost feel as though my audio system is going to explode but then it settles back down to a sort of numbness. Finally, the CD builds to the final volley which makes my skin tingle. I think the most obvious comparison is Tool, but there is a much more refined and complex structure to this music. Ok - I love this CD, and recommend it to anyone who appreciates good rock music.
0060920084|3.0|`The Lost Continent' is Bryson's first travelogue, and despite a few rough edges, many of what would become his trademarks are present. This is also one of Bryson's more serious books, commenting on the supposed decline of rural America, as friendly little towns are being paved over by endless car parks and fast food stores. As with all of Bryson's books, it is important to remember that his main interest is in telling a funny and interesting story, not strict accuracy. He will exaggerate and distort for humour, and tar a whole town or state by the actions of a few people. But even allowing for this, `The Lost Continent' is an inconsistent book. Its best moments are laugh-out-loud funny, the research is comprehensive, and we do feel Bryson's regret at seeing the towns of his childhood become \\"Junkvilles\\". But the social commentary is very heavy-handed, repetitive, and quite patronising in parts, and actually detracts from the point he is attempting to make.    At times, his criticism and commentary are spot on, and hilarious.....even now when I hear a kid crying in K-Mart I picture an overweight woman screaming \\"if you don't shut up I won't bring you back here no more!\\". At other times, he takes a very condescending approach that borders on elitism. Gee, Bill, rural people and Southerners are all inbred redneck morons? Never seen THAT stereotype before, have we? Such an approach is particularly ironic given Bryson himself is from Iowa, and seems to want to draw on his Midwestern credentials throughout the book. In fact, Bryson's a bit of a hypocrite at times; for example, he complains about poverty  and social disadvantage, while at another point in the book boasts about \\"eating the GNP of Lesotho\\" at a Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant.     In the beginning of the book, Bryson notes that one of his main motivations for his journey was the death of his father, and the realisation that he himself is not getting any younger. And it is possible to see this book as a sort of midlife crisis put to paper. Bryson seems to hanker for some mythical past when every town was a neat little Perfectville, and everyone was friendly and knew each other's business.  As I say, at times his observations are very funny, but too often he sounds like the grumpy old man in the corner who complains about everything being better in the \\"Good Old Days\\".     So `The Lost Continent' is a bit of a mixed bag. Personally, I found his personal anecdotes (especially regarding his late father) and some of the descriptive passages the best parts of the book. But the book would have worked a lot better, and hit harder, had Bryson reigned in his smugness a bit.
0740785508|5.0|Laden with color photographs and wisdom from a true professional, \\"Imaginative Realism\\" is a perfect reference for traditional painters and digital artists.     The text is written with a personal, friendly, conversational style, which is easy to comprehend. The tools presented may be useful to both neophytes and advanced illustrators.  In terms of readability, sections are kept short, yet enumerated; and the author provides resourceful tips and tricks of the trade (i.e. how to use mirror study, projecting behaviors, essentials of acting in character, and other useful advice).    This book is a good investment that guarantees progress and maybe near-perfection.

This book is printed on heavy coated paper and the illustrations are gorgeous. Many of the elements are not particularly visually striking but the author has in every case provided pictures that show some facit of the element even if it has to be shown as a part of an alloy or assemblage.  The author writes in a humerous fashion and you will get many laughs reading this book. He has accomplished something that I had wanted to do which was building a display of all of the displayable elements. He explains all of this on his website and also sells sets of elements for people who want to have their own displays.  I gave this book 5 stars because I don't see how anybody could top it.

B002MW50KY|1.0|I know this was developed as a joke for charity but Bob's tuneless drag-gravel voice appropriately destroys these  over-played standards nonetheless.  It's hysterical, and grating at the same time.  You must hear these songs...once  then there's no need to buy the CD unless it's for the charity angle or to clear out a holiday party gone overtime.    All that said, Bob Dylan still must be acknowledged as the single most important   American male poet/singer/songwriter in the last 100 years.

0375842209|3.0|...it didn't move me.    Before I began reading it, I was curious about how this novel could have accrued so many accolades...and yet also, some really scathing reviews. The book's blurbs were *so* effusive. It seemed like reading it was going to be a real experience for me, a truly transcendent experience.    It wasn't. On either count.    It's well-written.    Its often pithy and almost point-form style makes the subject matter easier to process. (Not that I needed it to be; I'm an adult reading a piece of young adult literature.)    And the characters are almost all interesting and well-shaped.    But it wasn't a memorable story. I didn't find myself not wanting to put it down. In fact, I found myself in 'dutiful reader' mode.    I'm glad that this story was written. I'm glad that so many people have clutched it to their chests. And I'm glad for the author's success.    It just didn't do it for me...regardless of its category.    (Personal rating: 7/10)
B000002C2E|5.0|I live on the border, drive cold hard winter roads, big winds and -30°.  I listened to this a few times and it was good.  Then the next summer I got Blastomycosis.  I almost died.  I was so weak and sick.  They saved my life at North Memorial and then I knew this record.  I heard it in my dreams at night.  I saw them come for me in the night, wild fever, and sweats and cold shiver.  When I got home, still weak, still sick, but alive, I put this CD on every night and the last thing I did before going to bed was to get through one song.  Bob had Histomycosic.  The drugs I took were most likely the same ones that Mr. D got as they treat the Blasto and Histo the same.  And I think I got to a place really close to these songs.  It's my favorite because it puts me in time again with the time when time was moving real slow.  Grateful to be alive.  There are little bits of lyrics, and the tempo is perfect to that time.  Amazing art by Mr D.  A painting is drawn for me throughout this recording...    Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't  But not tonight and it won't be here  There are things I could say, but I don't  I know the mercy of God must be near    I've been ridin a /the midnight train  Got ice water in my veins......    God Bless the special people out there that saved Bob, and saved me.  And to Sue, who stayed there with me, the 104° for weeks, shakes, night sweats, and all that came with the blasto.  God is close.      [[ASIN:B000002C2E Time Out of Mind]]
B002P7UCMC|5.0|As always Rammstein has released a great album. With heavy guitar riffs and almost lullaby sounding melodies from the keyboard, this album draws you in to listen over and over. The drums in this album are heavier than most of Rammsteins previous releases but it is very becoming to the band and the direction of the music. Liebe ist fuer alle da is a change from earlier albums as they have seemed to incorperated some American metal (i.e. Slipknot, Mudvayne) sound into the Tanzenmetal genre of Germany.   When it comes to lyrics Rammstein is always pusing the limits in exploring the dark tendencies, and experiences within our world. This album is pushing those limits even farther with songs like \\"Ich tu dir Weh\\" (I hurt you), and P*$$*. Each song has its offensive overtures but these overtures help see the world from a different point of view, as is the point of testing the waters with music and most art.    I would recommend this and the Limited edition digipack (the extra 5 songs are worth the extra money) to any Rammstein, and metal fan.    I get most of my Lyric and Song meaning from [...]
B000001ELP|5.0|Forget everything you've heard, forget the supposed \\"concept,\\" forget that this album is even by KISS at all.  Just listen, learn and love...<br /><br />\\"Music from the Elder\\" is this: a very cool, unusual, majestic, haunting, sometimes silly, rarely pretentious, entirely wonderful, and above all supremely melodic rock album.  It doesn't sound like the 1970s or '80s, and it doesn't really sound like the KISS we all know.  It's its own animal, and after 28 years of bad-rapping -- most shamefully by Misters Simmons and Stanley, who ought to be far prouder of this, and far more ashamed of all the hair-metal junk they wasted the rest of the '80s recording -- \\"The Elder\\" deserves a good honest listen.<br /><br />Despite the stories about producer Bob Ezrin's coke-fueled megalomania, his work here sounds awesome as usual; the thing rocks massively (\\"Escape from the Island,\\" \\"The Oath\\") and swoons gorgeously (\\"Odyssey,\\" \\"A World Without Heroes\\").<br /><br />All this plus \\"Dark Light\\" (Ace Frehley's best song after \\"Shock Me\\" and \\"Rocket Ride\\") and three songs co-written with Lou Reed of all people?  Do yourself a favor: just give this album a damn chance, and learn to respect your \\"Elder\\"!  This is one of KISS' best-ever albums -- deal with it!<br /><br />By the way, Gene and Paul?  There's more to life than record $ale$...
1594488916|2.0|I'm enjoying this read, but finding myself annoyed by the author's naivete. She goes around with her subject to a the scene of one of his crimes, and then is dismayed to find herself becoming part of the story. She wonders about his motives, but never seeks the insight of a criminologist or a psychologist. She seems totally unaware that the criminal whose misdeeds she sanctions through her fawning, nonjudgemental curiosity is using her to justify his actions, both to himself and to the world. The pretty blonde finds him fascinating- how could this not stoke his ego, and reassure him that he's in the right?  In all, though I don't like to wish ill on anyone, I can't help thinking that her attitude would change if someone robbed her house- perhaps stole the only copy of her next book just before it went to the publisher- or picked her car clean off the street, never to be seen again. Her tone of amoral equivocation swoops nauseatingly close to that of the crook she's profiling, and essentially ignores the damage and violence he does to the hard work, to the dreams and passions, of others. In her drive to \\"get\\" his story- and, we may posit, to sell books and to aggrandize herself- she tacitly condones his destructive behavior. A closer knowledge of the empty feeling of the violated might make her less surprised at the anger his victims still express years after the fact.   But frankly, I doubt it. She's a grown woman with college-aged children and should know better. I will studiously avoid her \\"work\\" in future, and recommend that you, gentle reader, do the same. In the end, she proves to be no better a person than the criminal she's profiling, and I feel like a sucker for having thought better of her than that.
0143037757|4.0|Tony Judt's book Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 superbly covers events in Central and Eastern Europe as well as giving attention to the more widely covered Western European states. Judt's ability to point out hidden as well as long-term trends should prove useful to all serious students of Europe after WW II.  In addition, Judt's style makes his content readily available to most of us.
1408427168|4.0|I think this CD Box Set will be very useful for many purposes, because    (1) you can simply enjoy the English literature without reading it;  (2) people who have a visibility problem can also enjoy the classic novel from cover to cover, as this is unabridged version;  (3) people who are learning English as a foreign language cannot only enjoy the novel but can also learn the way the native British people speak, e.g. the pronunciation, the tone, the speed etc., with Jenny Agutter's beautiful English (slightly fast though);  (4) you can listen to it whenever you have time while you're doing something else, such as driving, cooking or even travelling by air;  (5) good for education and fun for young people who don't have much time to read nowadays or who don't have a mother who can read bedside stories for them like old days..    I think it would be a good present too! It's a very good quality audio book by the BBC, so I can highly recommend this product to anyone!    Hope this helps!

I can not say enough about the great job Andy Field does in breaking down formulas and explaining each step of the process in a concise, to the point manner and how to use SPSS. I am never confused in reading this book and use at as my main text in replace of the class text book. Every other text I have ever had gets blown out of the water by this one. I wish I had this in undergrad.

1861085257|4.0|I own Angie Scarr's first book too, and prefer the first one to the 2nd one. The 2nd one feels a little rushed, and feels like as much data was crammed in there as possible, so the step by step tutorials aren't as thorough. Overall, though if you already have experience with canning it's a great resource and inspiration. It might just be a little tough for beginners to follow along.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Up is by far my favorite Pixar movie. WHen I saw it in digital 3D, I was excited but also very doubtful, because I was unsure of whether or not Disney would be able to reach the heights that they did with \\"WALL-E\\". But I walked out of the theater totally amazed! It is indeed Pixar's best film yet, even better than WALL-E.<br /><br />Yesteday I bought this at HMV. When I got home, I watched the movie and then explored the features.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY: 5/5: This edition has what most blu-rays lack nowadays- reak ooomph. You can feel it when the house ascends from the ground! The score is vivified here too, almost in a way that the score plays a real charater in the film. The subwoofer and back speakers create a sense of surrounding too- something that makes you feel like you're in it.<br /><br />PICTURE: Infinite/5- This may just have the best picture quality for the Blu-Ray format. WALL-E and Bolt were both deemed to be the best Blu-Ray releases, but this one beats them put of the park. No grain, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, just perfect. No complaints about the picture at all! The Boosted-Up colors in \\"WALL-E\\" looked great, but this movie takes on a more natural look, whereas they still srike you. The montage looked great, but what looked the best were the scenes in Muntz's blimp.<br /><br />EXTRAS: 4/5- They were pretty good extras, but this didn't need to have two discs- a lot of the features could easily fit on one disc. That said, they're still cool. The alternate endings one was really cool, the game was a fun play, and the documentaries were worth watching for sure.<br /><br />TOTAL: 5/5- Do get this Blu-Ray. You will not regret it!
0545123267|5.0|This is the book that practically the blog-o-sphere erupted about (along with Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins and Fire by Kristin Cashore), or so it seemed to me. Almost every one of my blog friends either read this, wanted to read this or wanted to have its babies (well joking about that last one). And I admit when I first heard about it, I wasn't 'OMG NEED NOW' excited, interested, but it wasn't something that made me want to run around begging for a copy. I haven't read Stiefvater before (which shocks people for some reason) actually, but I had a chance to nab this at BEA and I took it. Some interest is still interest after all.<br /><br />I'm glad I did and I'm glad that I didn't read previous reviews. I think if I had I would have gone into this expecting something else. As it is the book felt so wistful to me. Half the cast wanted to be something they couldn't be, the other half wanted to ignore the truth and everybody was so lost it was painful at times to read. Its slightly more violent then I thought it would be too (which isn't a bad thing, I'm a slightly more violent person then people suspect as well).<br /><br />Grace is...relatable for me. She's not perfect or gorgeous or stunningly intelligent--she's got some messed up emotional baggage, friends who are either really fabulous or kind of flaky (depending on how you look at them) and her family life is just this side of cringe-worthy. I love her. She doesn't whine about her situation, doesn't angst about the fact she's in love with a guy who's an animal 9 months out of the year (if not more), just takes everything as it comes at her and works hard not to let the painful things bog her down too much.<br /><br />How I feel about Sam is a mystery to me. He was pretty plain spoken, an open book practically with his feelings and didn't lie that often (and when he did it was understandable), but something eluded me. I think because we focused on his pain for so much of the book--even when it was Grace's POV she dwelled less on the immediate problems she faced and more on how much pain Sam had to be in and how bad his past was--that when things began to shift towards a defining moment I felt like the book ended in one sense.<br /><br />Slowly the tension builds and you can almost feel it. Each chapter has the temperature listed beneath the Name and chapter number, giving you a sense of how much Sam is struggling (since when he gets too cold his body automatically shifts to wolf form) in any given chapter. More then that though is the dwindling population of the clan as more and more either die or can no longer shift to human form again. There is of course only two options open to them--either allow nature to take its course or supplement the clan with new blood (so to speak). The ramifications of an unwise transformation however can be brutal and even if things begin all right, that doesn't mean they stay all right.<br /><br />Shiver is a wonderful book with a chilling (check that pun out) atmospheric feel to it and a narrative voice to match. Suspenseful. That's how I would describe it in one word.immediate problems she faced and more on how much pain Sam had to be in and how bad his past was--that when things began to shift towards a defining moment I felt like the book ended in one sense.

B002C6K7N0|2.0|UA, the previous record, was way better.  All the songs on End Game are faster and attempt to be heavier than previous Megadeth records.  Dave's vocals and lyrics are lame.  Chris's solos are weak and very boring.  He sweep picks arpeggios and tries playing fast scale runs.  In fact, this entire records sounds like the background music to an arcade videogame, like Super Mario Brothers.  Metallica blew Megadeth out of the water with their latest record release.   Dave needs to fire all current members, and hire Marty, David, and Nick back. He needs re-visit Megadeth's thrash roots and create another Rust Record. Other than that, he shouldn't release any other records.

0061735817|5.0|I read this book a number of years ago, and I laughed so hard I cried--and the audio book version is even funnier. The narrator is great! I loved it so much that having purchased the CDs, which I listened to in my car, I also bought the audio download so that I can listen to it on my ipod whenever I am in the mood for a laugh. BUY THIS BOOK!! You won't be disappointed.
0385504225|1.0|I'm not a picky reader, and I don't write fancy reviews, but this book may just be my least favorite book I've read in my life. Robert Langdon is one of the worst characters I've read and he drove me crazy. \\"THINK!\\" He's so \\"intelligent\\" that it seems like he can't believe in anything. This was a terribly written book, and I read it quickly just to get it over with.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|An action-packed, non-stop ROMP which is reminiscent of the old G.I.Joe cartoon of my youth!  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and loved the jokes and banter....especially from Marlon Wayans!  Interesting plot although a lot of people say they found it hard to follow...I guess I have a different way of looking at things; more like from a child's perspective.  I believe that anyone who was a fan of the comic, the cartoon or the toys, will enjoy this movie!

B002L3RVCY|5.0|For the Science Fiction Star Wars geek, what's not to love?  So what, it's done in almost video game animation style.  I'm all right with that.  The series absolutley SCREAMS Star Wars.  It has all the things we all thought were cool about the movies.  And it is made by fans of Star Wars, which is a plus.  They stay true to the universe.  The bonus features are awesome as well.  I was, like I am sure a lot of fans, a little hesitant that animated SW could be good, but this is good.  Granted the droids are a little too dumb, but I can get over that.  This is good entertainment.

1594202249|5.0|I liked this better than anything Pynchon's written since Gravity's Rainbow. Pynchon's not much of a novelist in the classic sense: his plots are byzantine rambling wrecks in which loose ends are never tied up; his women are all \\"sexy chicks\\" or older female relatives; you can barely tell his characters apart if they talk for more than a couple sentences, because they all sound like Thomas Pynchon, and they certainly don't motivate his plots. But who cares? Not me, because he's the epic poet of our disintegrating age.     In Inherent Vice, Pynchon waxes nostalgic for the lost era when some of us thought that, given enough LSD, we could save our greedy real estate crazed violent society from itself. The vehicle for expressing this nostalgia is Doc Sportello, a pot-head detective who tries to stay groovy with everything, and my favorite of all Pynchon's characters, perhaps because he's more like Pynchon than any of the others, so hearing Pynchon's thoughts in Sportello's brain seems natural.     Perhaps due to age, Pynchon's gotten a bit careless about detail, or maybe I just didn't know enough about WWII to notice the time slips in Gravity's Rainbow. According to the Wiki commentary, the novel takes place between March 24th and May 8th, 1970, but during the present tense time of the narration, Lew Alcindor has already changed his name to Kareem-Abdul Jabbar, which didn't happen until 1971, and the Manson trial, which didn't start until June 15th, 1970, is taking or has just taken place. Maybe it's all that pot Sportello's been smoking that keeps him from being firmly anchored in time, or maybe Pynchon was in too big a hurry to do the research needed to pin all the novel's events down firmly to one consistent time line. I've said it once, and have to say it again. Who cares when Pynchon's endlessly original and evocative poetry tumbles out of almost every page? This is a novel that's making me re-think my abhorrence of \\"language\\" literature. Most novelists can't pullit off, but in Pynchon's case, his voice is almost (except in the case of Mason & Dixon) enough.
B000060K4O|5.0|The product arrived exactly as they sated the product would be and in shorter time than projected.
0385504225|4.0|This book had a very good story line and interesting plot twists.  The only problem I had was after the villain was stopped the ending dragged out several chapters longer than it needed to.  It was almost like he didn't quite know how to wind the story down to the end.  Other than that it is a good read.  I'd recommend it although don't expect it to be as good as \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code\\".
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I have all of their albums and this is by far the best. This album was so well done that i really dont have a favorite because their all great songs. You get an r&b sound for both ballads and up tempo's. It's really good the way they mixed it up. Normally BSB are known for their pop ballads but this album will blow your mind.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|Abbey Road and The White Album are my two all-time favorite Beatles albums.  So you can imagine my excitement when I put this disc into my CD player for the first time, hoping that the newly remastered version would totally blow me away.<br /><br />It didn't, but the music was still great regardless.<br /><br />Having heard many of these remasters now, to my ear I really don't hear much difference from the 87 versions.  I like the packaging, but I think I could have easily kept the old disc and been happy.<br /><br />The music, naturally, is 5 stars.  I subtract one star for Apple being too greedy to put both the mono and stereo version on the same disc (for any disc shorter than 40 mins, of course)
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Having never seen even one \\"True Blood\\" episode, I found Anna Paquin's portrail of Sookie Stackhouse to be so enchanting, and the tales so compelling, I watched the entire First Season over one weekend!    One caution: some shows have nudity in them, so these may not be appropriate for all ages. I suggest Parental pre-screening.
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|I just watched this movie last movie. It takes a classic bad seed movie and adds its own twist. While the 9 year old lead star gives an award winning performance, all of the child actors did a great job. The hear-impaired little girl was also compelling and thankfully sub-titles are included for those of us who don't know ASL.<br /><br />The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for every twist and turn. The suspense builds in way I haven't experienced since the Hand That Rocks the Cradle. Overall, a fun thriller I can't wait to watch again.
0385483821|5.0|I read this book several years ago and discovered hidden inside a great story by a rare leader about how to lead and manage an organization undergoing transformation.

B002N1AEN2|4.0|Uk indie quartet (all of them in their early 20s) The XX seemingly came out of nowhere with their early 2009 UK debut single \\"Crystalized\\" and immediately created a huge buzz in the indie-cummunity. Now comes the debut album. For those wondering, it is quite hard to describe the sound of the band, as they bring a mix of pop/indie/post-punk.<br /><br />\\"XX\\" (11 tracks; 39 min.) kicks off with the instrumental opener \\"Intro\\", a gorgeous 2 min. blast of dreamy sounds. \\"VCR\\" is the first song where we hear co-vocalists Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim, and immediately you feel the chemistry.  That UK single \\"Crystalized\\" follows, and it's easy to see why it created that buzz. Similarly \\"Heart Skips a Beat\\" (my fave track on here) perfectly synthesizes the band's sound. Great tracks follow one after another. \\"Fantasy\\" is a hauntingly slow and abstract track, just fantastic. \\"Shelter\\" is a showpiece for Romy. \\"Basic Space\\" highlights yet again the great interplay between the 2 main singers, and another highlight on this album. The 5 min. \\"Infinity\\" track, by far the longest on the album is another slowburner, awash in immaculate instrumentation, wow. But truth be told, this album is a mood piece, and if you get into it, there isn't a single weak track on here.<br /><br />In all, this is quite the mesmorizing album. At 39 min., it clips by in no time, and you just want to play this again and again, and again. I really hope the XX will come stateside in support of this album (are you reading this Coachella organizers?). Meanwhile, if you wonder where you can hear this band, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none, and where I found out about these guys. This album remains in high rotation there for many months now. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B002TYGZF4|5.0|It's really sad.  The best album released in the past 10 years (this is it) is a live concert recorded 17 years ago.  Where is the new Nirvana?    That aside, if you want to but a great album, this is it.  It has fantastic versions of the best Nirvana songs, and the power of the band comes through loud and clear.  The recording quality is very good for a live album, and balance between the crowd and the music is excellent.  Not much else to say really, just buy it.

I own the original LP's and its nice to have the additional songs on Revolver. (I'm only dreaming and your bird can sing)<br />If you don't yet own this set it is so worth it!
068485743X|3.0|This book would be great for beginners, but for someone who has already read many 'how-to' books, there was really no new advice. It was interesting to read how agents think, but beyond that it was a lesson for new writers, citing mistakes that a seasoned writer would never make.
B002PAQB2O|4.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time and it's frustrating to have to read it in such a poor edition.  The typos and all-over formatting is deplorable (That's why the 4 stars as opposed to the 5 stars it should deserve).  The material is still wonderful, so much can be forgiven.  I question however, how this e-book was created.  It does not even list the correct author (Waugh)and the author listed (Wendorf) has not added any commentary to the text.  Makes me wonder if this is a pirate copy that slipped by Amazon!  Whatever, for 2 bucks it's still one of the 100 greatest books ever written and deserves to be in everyones' collections.
0307716988|3.0|I'm HUGE Michael Jackson fan... In the process of mourning his death I've read several of \\"the best\\" biographies on Michael and reviewed them on this forum. Moonwalk is an easy to read autobiography dictated by Michael. Not meant to win a purlizer just a light, mostly lovely account of a lovely young man written over twenty years ago.. The photos were wonderful and splashed throughout the book, Moonwalk follows the chronological order of MJ's early life nicely...He glosses over any real trauma only hinting of it on occasion. He only allows the reader to know what he wants them to. Even 20 years ago he seemed torn, lonely, not really happy..I doubt that standing in Michael Jacksons shoes was a good place to stand... On the subject of Michael, I would never even try to understand such a complicated individual..In retrospect Michael, who was possibly the most talented person that has graced this earth, may have fallen for his own hype...When one hears they are the king, they are brilliant, they are genious, they are the very best enough times they begin to lose touch with reality, even if they do possess all of the above gifts...They fall for their own hype...This is a bad thing...We have all watched the results..When people lose touch and are not properly grounded they'll answer to no one, they'll listen to no one, they'll do as they please.. \\"No\\" and \\"enough\\" are not words that are acceptable to a person that believes they are a king... The fact is he was human being. Just a man with huge emotional, mental, physical and in the end financial problems adding the complication of drug addiction....With no one that he would listen to or answer to Micheal had no boundries or limits and having no boundries or limits is a bad bad thing...I know this, because we've lost him...Be at peace Michael, you are forever missed...

0143034901|2.0|...but not by far.  TSOEW might have fared well at novella length.  Foreshadowing Zafon's second novel, this one, too, is completely bloated -- hundreds of pages longer than it should have been.  If endless doors \\"ajar\\", sunrises poured like molten copper/gold/tin/iron across blood-red/coal-black skies, putrid/stinking/rancid flesh, and shadows -- my God, the shadows! -- are your thing, and if you love a pat ending, occasional moralizing and a pretense to intellectualism, then you're in for a treat.  The second star in my rating is by comparison with Zafon's truly unbearable followup novel, and because the story at the core of TSOEW -- buried under Zafon's gloppily layered prose -- is at least a clever one.<br /><br />What Borgesian book adventure will Zafon think up next?  For my part, I doubt I'll make it past the title.

B0028K3192|5.0|You really need to watch the DVD that comes with this CD. \\"Making of BSN\\" type doccie. Beyond a doubt you will understand the conception of \\"Art\\". Give it some time, you will notice the importance of this cd in the evolution of an ex predominantly commercial artist. There comes a time when you've just got to shed the weight of society and it's expectations. Being true to one's self. This is what I believe BSM is all about, for \\"Musze\\".
0765356147|5.0|You could say I'm an avid fantasy reader. I've been reading just about any decent fantasy series I could put my hands on in the last 15 years and rarely has a series struck me as powerfully as this one has.     Without giving any spoilers I will say that in the end everything makes sense. It's rare that a book will catch me off guard like that where I will not see things coming. It definitely isn't your typical formulaic fantasy novel. Definitely worth reading.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Quite frankly, I am completely biased to anything this legendary creator of audio aesthetic conceives. Add to that the fact that a live dvd was so long overdue.

1906694176|5.0|This third installment in Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy (which was originally meant to contain twelve books; due to Stieg Larsson's premature death caused by a tragic and brutal heart attack, it became a trilogy) is easily the best of the bunch.<br />Stieg Larsson is a genious. And there is no doubt in my mind that, in time, he will become known as one of the best crime thriller writers of all time. If not the very best. It made me step back and go \\"whoa!\\" on more than one occasion.<br />There is something complex and magical about the simplicity of his writing. Every word and every sentence flows easily into the next as we follow each of the characters through basically every step of their everyday lives (which, I must say, are nothing at all like my everyday life). At one point in time, we are follow six whole stories at the same time; never once does it seem daunting or overwhelming (even with all those crazy Swedish names). Never once did I feel lost, and I cared equally about all of the stories and their interconnections. Not one small thing is left out, and yet there manages to be nothing superfluous about the content.<br />Because we get to see each of the characters at their best and their worst, doing some of the most mundane things, we grow to know them and all of their complexities without even realizing it. I can easily say, without even giving it a second though, that Lisbeth Salander is the most real and unique heroine I have ever read. And Mikael Blomkvist is up there with one of the most believable, unique heroes I have ever read.<br />Even the secondary characters are well thought-out, well-developed, integral parts of the story.<br /><br />This is a story about being on the wrong side of corruption and about fighting for the basic rights that come with being a human being. It is a crime thriller, to be sure, but this book is accessible to everyone (well, grown-ups at least). Stieg Larsson's to the point way of presenting all the facts one after the other will, without out a doubt, leave the reader open-mouthed at the edge of their seat until the very end. And even though, as this is the last of the three, everything is tied up nicely, with no loose ends so to speak, the reader can't help but crave for more.out a doubt, leave the reader open-mouthed at the edge of their seat until the very end.

0810983915|5.0|I bought this book for my son and got hooked on it myself. A quick 1 45 minute read.
B002N2XHXU|5.0|Wow! Really, that's it, just wow! This book read more like a conversation (granted, a one-sided conversation in which I said nothing, but still. . .) than a book. I felt like Ishmael Beah was sitting right there beside me recounting the tragedy of his life as if it was just another day in war-free America. That's not to say, though, that it wasn't heart-wrenching and painful to read. It was honest, extraordinary, awesome, introspective, and straight-forward. And the story is a story that NEEDS to be heard. I think that it is important that people become aware of what children are put through in other countries, the wars that they are forced to fight - over time, awareness leads to action and action leads to change. Ishmael Beah told his story in such a way that forces even the most uninterested person to become aware - without making them feel like they are suffering through a history lesson. This book was everything it needed to be, everything it should be. . . and even more.<br />Who Should Read It? Read this if you're interested in a tragic/traumatic true story that will make you cringe and force you to become aware. No, really, whoever you are, just READ THIS BOOK!
0061914177|5.0|Very informative!  I will use this book as a reference for a long time.  Good job Tim Brown!
0307269981|5.0|This is a fantastically tordid and twisted story that pulls the reader in every possible direction and sends them on a page turning murder investigating roller coaster ride. This book is a nice continuation of the first one (although, sadly, not quite as unique and exciting, thus no 5 stars) in that we get to see the two main characters working together once again, but in a very different way that the first time around. We learn so much more about both of them and begin to understand what makes them tick, making them even more fascinating than they were the first time around. The greatest thing about this book, though, is that, for me at least, it is anything but predictable. I actually changed my mind several times throughout the course of the book about the innocence of certain characters.<br />One last thing - after reading this book, I am convinced even more that the untimely death (what is up with all of these \\"premature\\" deaths as of late?!?) of Stieg Larsson in 2004 can be considered a tragedy. Apparently, he was planning to write 10 of these thrillers, but now we'll just have to live with three.  Sadness
B000FP2OPY|4.0|This show is fun to watch.  I never knew either actor in the show, but by end of the season I love both of them.  I will be buying the rest of the seasons.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I absolutely loved the Twilight soundtrack and despise the New Moon soundtrack. No matter how many times I force myself to listen to it, I can't seem to find a way to like it. The singers all have the same sound and the entire album is far too mellow for my taste. The only good thing to say about this soundtrack is how the lyrics for the songs seem to fit the overall theme of the movie. I've found it to be a perfect waste of money. The Eclipse soundtrack had better be better, and I think I'll wait and buy it AFTER I watch the movie and can preview the songs like I did with Twilight.

B001R4MEYS|4.0|THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING! I saw mastodon in concert, and they played this entire album with the music video in the background. I bought this dvd/cd set hoping to see the video on there. It's not D:    Don't let this review sway you from buying the album. its amazing. you'll love it. just the dvd doesnt have their video on it (sadly).
B002M9WW30|3.0|I used to order ALL of my titles from Amazon. Used to. I have been just picking them up at Walmart for the same price or even a little cheaper. Since Amazon likes to screw the customers that PRE ORDER what is the point? The last few months they sell their new titles a few dollars more to the PRE ORDER folks then drop the price a day later to new orders. Fool me once or twice... I guess I don't need to be a PRIME MEMBER anymore either!
B001ECDVKE|4.0|This title could excel in Blu-ray. With a good remastering, CGI clean-up, Dolby/THX, some good extras & special features, and maybe a documentary about the satire/commentary on society etc, and/or the historical & surreal inspirations for the narrative and visual styling. The box art is also nice minus the actor photos. Not perfect but what good cult film is.
B002V0WN2K|2.0|I would classify this more as an \\"Easy Listening\\" album than a Rock album.    I guess in their old age they need to tone it down a bit.  This album can definitely make the top 50 \\"Most UnMetal moments\\".
3527406018|5.0|Griffith's introductory book on the Standard Model of particle physics is a magnificently accessible overview of a very complex subject. The book covers all of the major topics, including the quark model, quantum electodynamics (subatomic level electromagnetic interactions), quantum chromodynamics (strong nuclear force interactions), Feynman diagrams (used to calculate information about particle interactions), electroweak theory (involved in nuclear decay processes). He also presents one of the most easily comprehensible discussions of quantum field theory I've seen.<br />Griffith's writing style is engaging and entertaining, which is very unusual for an advanced physics text. The book is a pleasure to read even if you don't really understand the topics. It was good enough that I sat and read the whole book, end to end.<br />What this book does not have is detailed mathematical derivations of the theories presented. Griffiths provides references to books that contain the proofs and derivations, but he focuses solely on the whats and hows. Another unfortunate drawback is that the book doesn't contain solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter, which would have been nice to have.<br />To really appreciate the book, one should have a college level science background, but one doesn't need to be a full blown physicist or mathematician to appreciate the book (I am a professional chemist, and my mathematical background is not all that advanced). All in all, this is, in my opinion, the best introduction to the Standard Model that's out there.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Sandra Bullock does her usual superb job in this suspenseful love story that takes one from NY to Alaska and back in Sandra's desperate attempt to prevent deportation back to her native Canada. She proposes marraige to her male understudy with additional employee benefits and devises an elaborate scheme to go to his native Alaska and marry him to avoid being sent back to Canada and losing her high level management position with her firm. However, she reveals the scam and prepares to leave the US only to find that her understudy is in love with her and in fact wants to marry her. Fast moving and sort of funny.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|I have to admit to being an extremely harsh critic of Mustaine's output over the past 10+ years. Having been a huge fan of Megadeth from \\"Peace Sells\\" to \\"Countdown\\", each release from \\"Youthanasia\\" and onward has consistently disappointed me. When I heard that Marty Friedman left the group around 1998, I was very open in my view that the band should call it quits. For some odd reason, I decided to shell out the money for the latest release \\"Endgame\\", and I listened to it initially with very skeptical ears. With all that being said, \\"Endgame\\" has resurrected my faith in the band. I don't know where the real Dave Mustaine has been all of these years, but he is back with a vengeance! This album has all of the angst, complexity, and brilliance of his 80's masterpieces - excluding \\"Killing is My Business\\" which I viewed as a glorified demo.     I was always annoyed with Megadeth albums after \\"Countdown\\" because the emphasis seemed to be on over-simplification and denial of the band's past rather than on creativity. \\"Endgame\\" shows Mustaine back in true musical and lyrical form. Many of the tracks could easily fit on \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Countdown\\"; however, I'm not saying that Dave is simply rehashing a tired-out formula. The music sounds fresh and new while still adhering to the qualities which made Megadeth stand out from the rest of their thrash metal peers. New lead guitarist Chris Broderick has injected new life into the band with his solid neo-classical technique (reminiscent of Jason Becker and Tony MacAlpine) and jaw-dropping solos. The rhythm section is probably the most solid duo I've heard since the Ellefson/Menza days. All in all, an excellent effort and a return to form of one of the greatest bands from the golden days of heavy metal.
0316069906|5.0|This book is a valued addition to my library.  It has a thoroughly researched look into the future of farming animals the American way while not resorting to PETA's militant entrail-tossing methods of vegetarian conversion which are so appalling.  As a vegetarian, I would feel comfortable giving this book to my meat-eating friends if they were interested to learn why I chose a vegetarian path.<br /><br />Foer's book has a lighthearted beginning, getting its start by a mock-argument(albeit a well-researched one)for eating dog.  This passage introduces readers to evaluate at why we as a culture eat some animals and not others.  Where does our sentimentality begin and our desire for meat with every vegetable end?  The book aims to open thoughts and dialog as well as provide facts of the current state of meat farming in the USA.<br /><br />The importance of this book isn't the potential of converting people over to vegetarianism or veganism, but it makes a compelling argument for how imperative it is ecologically and socially to get away from the factory methods of farming currently used in nearly ALL of America's meat industries.  While the book largely does focus on animal suffering under the current factory model, it also highlights facts about how factory farms keep meat prices artificially deflated, and the health impacts of workers and residents.<br /><br />This book is an engaging read, supported by facts, but not drowning in footnotes.  It inspired some good peaceful conversations among my omnivorous family and myself as to why I have made the choices that I have.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|Great show and a fantastic production that deserves to be seen and saved. I was very happy!
B002LK3DUQ|1.0|\\"Up\\" is a great movie, I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately they've crippled the DVD with some new form of DRM that prevents it being played on many computers.  I have bought and returned three DVDs so far and every one fails to play because Disney locks the movie up with a DRM.  Think about this for a moment.  I pay for the DVD, I now own the DVD, but because Disney has convinced themselves that I, the customer, can not be trusted they rig up the DVD, which I bought, so I can't watch it.    I am not alone in this.  When I was in the store returning one of the non-playing DVDs there were four other customers doing the same and all with the same complaint: it will not play on a computer.    Again I recommend \\"Up,\\" it's a great movie.  Too bad I can't buy a DVD and watch it.
B000GW8OAA|4.0|Many people did not like this film but its solid enough in my opinion to interest some. Besides, there are very few original movies this days and I'm not saying this is one but people should not expect that much from studios these days.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Got this, ripped it open and have not stopped listening to it since!  Absolutely one of his bests.  The two that he co-wrote are just wonderful.  Even my 7 year old is in love with him now.  She makes me play \\"just haven't met you yet\\" and \\"hold on\\" over and over.  We have the words memorized.  Just love this new one!!!!
B000GW8OAK|3.0|I'm not implying that the first movie was a masterpiece, but I do think that the first part was better. Still, its a good sequel and follows the storyline well, without any continuity errors.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|I should have known that when a blu-ray disc was selling for under $10 that something was wrong. Sure enough, the picture quality is pretty much the same as a regular DVD. The fact that it's selling for such a low price probably means that somebody is wising up and will soon issue a better quality blu-ray version. My advice is to pass up on this offer and instead wait for the definitive treatment.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is the original way the Beatles should be heard.  There are many differences from the mixes we are used to on stereo.  The packaging is also really nice.  The price is a little high, but I think it is worth it.
630587493X|5.0|I loved this movie as soon as i seen it. I have never seen it in the theater, I first saw it on the movie networks on satalite. When i first saw it the ending was a real tear jerker. I just wish they would make more movies like this. If anybody wants to buy this dvd just do so u wont be sorry. U will have a good time and dont forget to watch it with the family. That makes it a whole lot better.

The other countless times I've read it have all been for me.  And everytime I read it, I discover something new.  Everyone should read this book - the story is timeless, the characters are so developed, and the writing is unmatched.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Im happy to have received this today. Love the boys. They're my favorite band. The DVD is great to have... saw them a couple of times this summer. The live cd is ripped and added to my mp3 player and ready for heavy rotation. Although I am a bit spoiled. I will have to purchase a used Blu Ray because this DVD quality is no 1080p. I forgot how pretty HD is. Great DVD. Great CD.     LOVE IT!
032147404X|5.0|This is a very practical, down-to-earth book that you can actually use and not have to learn all the technical details.  I have picked up a bunch of good ideas that I have immediately put to good use.
044654146X|5.0|This book is written without unnecessary jargon in a clear simple style.  So even though I am no expert in finance I was still able to both enjoy the material and learn a great deal.      I do think that the authors missed one of the factors that led to the \\"start up miracle\\" and that is the repeal of various odious taxes:  we moved to Israel 20 years ago and watched the transformation here take place. When we arrived with our IBM clone computer (using the Intel 8088 chip),that my husband actually assembled from parts, Israel taxed us 100% of the price - about 1000$ !! These absurd taxes on all high tech, which at the time was considered unnecessary luxury, stifled innovation in technology. The high tech miracle in Israel could not have started with out those taxes being repealed which they finally were in 1989 or 1990. For a completely different view of the land of Israel visit my website.
0312360258|1.0|This is probably the worst book I have ever read.  The characters are superficial and cliched, the plot predictable and silly, and the narration is whiny and irritating.  Case in point, the main character makes some sort of stupid, childish statement followed by the phrase \\"hee hee\\" at least once in each chapter.  One chapter ends with a discussion of \\"poopie\\" and female body parts are repeatedly referred to as \\"boobies.\\"  I understand that the writers are trying to emulate the thought patterns of a teenager, but even most teenagers aren't this inane and childish.  \\"Poopie\\" is the phraseology and humor of a 2nd-grader, not a sixteen-year-old.    I rarely write book reviews, even of those books I don't particularly enjoy (which is quite rare, actually), but I was so angry that I wasted precious hours of my life reading this ridiculous tripe that I was motivated to try to save others from the same fate.  I cannot recommend strongly enough to avoid this irritating book.
0882709194|5.0|I've read this book, including the 50-page introduction people are ranting about. I highly suspect that a bunch of people from some online community just decided to deface the ratings of this book without actually bothering to read it (Having read these comments after reading the book, I find them quite amusing). Yes, the introduction to the book has been written by Ray Comfort, who happens to believe in Intelligent Design. But this was done in the spirit of -- to put in Darwin's own words -- \\"fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides\\".

B0029O08WA|1.0|the first cd was waaaaayyyy better than this one.....except the instrumental at the end was great!
B002BSHXJA|4.0|I am really enjoying these CDs. The sound quality is almost uniformly excellent. It's fun to make out the differences from the stereos. Of course, they would sound much better if they had been fully remixed, 34-40 years after the original recordings, 22 years after the 1st CD releases. Also, I think these monos should be more widely available, not just in a boxed set, but sold separately. And with the stereo versions on the same discs as much as possible. They did it w/ Help and Rubber Soul. They could have done the same thing w/ most of the rest of the catalogue. The Beatles, when still together, mostly did not release songs on singles that appeared on their LPs, in the UK. The same philosophy, I feel, should have been behind these remasters -- \\"more value for the money.\\"    Steven Van Zandt wrote the following about the monos in the current Sound+Vision magazine, on page 33: \\"You're not necessarily meant to hear everything separately...You want the balance of clarity and integration and the Beatles were the masters of that in mono.\\" I agree.
1932100385|1.0|After waiting for a couple of weeks for my item to arrive, I checked the package tracking. The seller had taken the item to USPS immediately following my purchase of the item, and USPS stated that it was delivered to my address two days later. After checking with my apt leasing office, the local PO, and everyone in between, I was basically informed by USPS that I have no recourse to recover my money, as according to them, the package was delivered. The seller was as helpful as could be under the circumstances, and assisted me with obtaining tracking info, as well as making suggestions for contacting local POs, etc. However, I will NEVER purchase a product that is being shipped USPS again and recommend that others don't either. The USPS was unhelpful, slow, and pretty rude. I have never had these issues with UPS or FedEx, and I order online fairly regularly (although this experience makes me hesitate to continue doing so.)

0307716988|5.0|Michael Jackson is the most misunderstood person. All the media and tabloid said all the crazy things about him before and after he died.  It's wonderful that they reissued this book again. It's nice to know his thought in his own words. He talked about a lots of things. How he grow up. How he learned all the things to make him such a great artist. How he create all these songs. I truly hope he wrote another autobiography again in recent years because I am tired of all the crazy stories. He said this and she said that. I don't know what to believe. If you want to know MJ, this is a must buy book.  I really enjoy reading it.
B0021L8UPS|2.0|This is another variant of \\"The Bad Seed\\", which was a far better film. The problem here can be laid on the Director. He fails to build any suspense whatsoever. Every attack is telegraphed far in advance, and they are rushed. So any suspense is nullified in favor of jumping right into the attack. The editing is another problem. Jump cuts make it difficult at times to really see what's going on.     The main problem with this film is that it is so predictable. Even the \\"twist ending\\" is easy to see coming. Anyone who has ever seen \\"The Bad Seed\\", \\"The Good Son\\" or \\"The Omen, can see where this film is heading. There are very few surprises. The girl, played by Isabelle Fuhrman, is supposed to be from Russia, but has a Scottish accent. Where did that come from?    I also had a big problem with the Standard DVD itself. It begins with a commercial for some soft drink, then goes on to subject you to a public service announcement about adoption, and a string (a long string) of previews. This wouldn't be so bad if you could access the main menu or \\"skip\\" through them. However, played on my Blu-Ray player, I was unable to do so. By the time I finally got to the main menu, I was very frustrated. This may not be a problem on a standard DVD Player or with the blu-Ray version.     If you haven't seen any of the above mentioned films, you may enjoy this. However, I found this to be mostly a cliche ridden, pale imitation of those films.
0312427646|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend and I found it entertaining and fun to read, but not particularly deep. The queen discovers books at a bookmobile and her love for reading disrupts the \\"household\\" and staff at the palace who are unaccustomed to seeing the queen so engrossed and questiioned about their reading habits.
0307716988|5.0|I found this book a great help in seeking things from Michael's point of view instead of what the media said about him. Very few of us will ever have the opportunity to befriend someone of MJ's status, but reading this book is surely the next best thing!
B00005QGAV|5.0|If you can get past Michael's beautiful eyes on the cover and you proceed to open and play this cd, you will find it is \\"Dangerously' addictive. I suggest that you buy two copies because you are likely to wear out the first copy playing it over and over again! Once you have the cd, you need to get the Dangerous Short Films dvd as well. The only thing better than the songs on Dangerous, are the songs with their short films and videos accompanying them. I highly recommend Michael Jackson's Dangerous.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I have kind of come into Joe Bonamassa backwards as far as owning any of his work.  Having watched a ton of him on You Tube from playing with Danny Gatton at 12 years old to Bloodline (those young guys were really good and talented, especially young Joey!) and up to this current \\"RAH\\" DVD concert.  In fact this \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" DVD was the first purchase for me and since have purchased the \\"Blues Deluxe\\" CD and \\"Rockpalast\\" DVD.  The \\"Rockpalast\\" DVD is exceptionally good and the not so good camera work did not bother me all that much just because Joe's Trio is really cookin' all the way threw from beginning to end.  From what I can hear and see he pretty much brings and delivers every time when he plays live.  As he has said \\"I am an entertainer and basically want to give the paying audience their monies worth.\\"  After hearing the intro to the song \\"Blues Deluxe\\", that pretty much got me hooked since I am such a blues nut!  He just played here in my local area at a small venue this past week for 2 nights in a row and unfortunately I was not able go catch his act.  At least I have the DVD's to watch and enjoy.    Okay, having said all that, this \\"RAH\\" DVD is so enjoyable to watch from beginning to end.  Currently I think Joe is trying to take his music to a little different area of sophistication for lack of a better word.  This dude has done the blazing trio thing (ie: \\"Rockpalast\\" DVD) for quite awhile up until this newer band with 3 horn players, a keyboard player and 2 drummers creating a totally different dimension.  We have to realize and remember Joe isn't really all that old being the ripe old age of 32.    This \\"RAH\\" concert was a 20 year dream for him to play this venue and also to play the tune \\"Further On Up The Road\\" with Clapton being one of his early mentors.  When I first heard Stevie Ray Vaughan's \\"Texas Flood\\" album back in 1983, and SRV was only around 28 or 29 at that time, man I thought this guy was God sent with the blues taking such a backseat with all the crap music back then.  The late SRV's music career just took off after that and myself becoming a huge fan like all the other many blues fans out there.  I am not trying to compare the late great SRV to JB so much in musical styles or whatever, though JB has and can hit that vibe shockingly well from his early age to say the least, but in a way I also think Joe is sort of God sent if there is such a thing.    Bonamassa comes off as a real nice guy and has the gift, talent and energy with what he shows in his guitar playing and singing.  He seems to be the sum of so many great past and present guitar players out there and still searching to find his own voice and groove.  That almost sounds like an oxymoron with what he has already accomplished.  I am sure we will see many sides of his talents as the years go bye and he sure has gotten my attention with his blues based style.  He's a natural as that old saying goes.  In closing, the last encore song \\"Asking Around For You\\" with horn arrangements etc.....for me it just doesn't get any better than that!  Superbly done and what a nice way to end the night of great music.

B0025VLEM0|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I enjoyed it, but it was nothing terribly special.  Then, I happened to be working (as an engineer) on a consumer electronics product that plays DVD, and this was one of the test discs that I used.  Consequently, I've seen the movie dozens of times now.      Rather than becoming tedious and repetitive, this movie actually gets better and better each time you watch it!  It's clear that enormous loving care went into the script, as there are dozens of instances of foreshadowing and inside jokes built into the scenery and dialog.  Minor characters turn out to be more deeply entwined with our heroes' lives than they appear at first.  And, there are so many subtle little jokes in the dialog that you won't catch on first viewing.    All in all, this is now one of my favorite movies, and one I watch from time to time just for fun.
0441013597|4.0|Dune was so hard for me to get into. The first hundred pages dragged on and I often thought of just giving up on the book completely. Luckily I'm stubborn and kept with it because once I got into it, I really got into it. The last 400 pages flew and I began to understand why Dune is one of the most beloved science fiction classics.
0061886041|5.0|Shutter Island is the first book that I have read by Dennis Lehane.  My husband and I had seen a trailer on tv for the movie and were so impressed by it that we couldn't wait and ordered the book.  We both loved it, especially my husband who read it twice.<br />The story is set in the 1950s.  It begins on a boat, where two Federal Marshalls are on their way to Shutter Island, a somewhat mysterious place where the criminally insane are being held. They are there to solve the disapperance of one of the patient/prisoners.  I won't go into any more detail except to say that there are plenty of mysteries to be solved and a good, if not happy ending to the story.<br />Dennis Lehane is a very good writer and I will be reading more of his stories in the future.  I will be happy if the movie is half as good as the book
B001U0D786|2.0|Like other reviewers, I was disappointed that this DVD movie had no subtitles and that it was produced using an inferior video format (1034i).  As one with hearing a deficit, I would not have bought it had I known this; maybe it is my own fault for not researching the product more closely; I will be much more cautious in the future, as I am with BBC-produced items which often lack English subtitles.  Even my 1997 \\"English Patient\\" laserdisc has subtitles. The less-than-ideal DVD sound quality makes Kristin Scott-Thomas's telling of the story of Gyges almost unintelligible unless one has heard it before. I'd think that an ethical seller 13 years later would have made a point of noting the primitive audio status of this product in the interest of service to handicapped persons.  Only the Direction of Anthony Minghella and superb acting mitigate this defect.

B001PO53IO|4.0|I was waiting for the whole season to come out before I bought this cartoon.  I hate \\"volumes\\" because its just a way of milking the consumer for more money.  Thanks to Lucasfilms for not being greedy and releasing the whole season as a set, and on Blu-Ray no less!  It's definitely worth getting this Blu-Ray release, it looks amazing.  Great cartoon as well.  Much better than all the crap anime that our children are forced to watch these days.
0316779237|4.0|One of the funniest and most entertaining stories Sedaris has ever written is the first story in this book, \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" his story about working as an elf in a department store Christmas display. It turns out that it is actually borrowed from one of his other books, Barrel Fever. The second best story I would say is \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" which is borrowed from his book Naked. It's a story about an unfortunate woman who is friends with David's sister Lisa. Those are the only two nonfiction stories in this collection.<br /><br />The other four stories are all fiction, and while they are creatively written I don't find them as interesting as Sedaris' true accounts of his own life. The fiction stories are over-the-top ridiculous. They're not bad, just not what I'm used to and not what I expected.<br /><br />Here are the stories:<br />  \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" (from Barrel Fever)<br />  \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\"<br />  \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" (from Naked)<br />  \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\"<br />  \\"Based Upon a True Story\\"<br />  \\"Christmas Means Giving\\"<br /><br />\\"Season's Greetings\\" is a seasonal letter written to friends and family, telling of the crazy events of the last year. \\"Front Row\\" is about attending childrens' Christmas plays, giving reviews of the actors, etc. \\"Based Upon a True Story\\" is about a man giving a Christmas speech from the pulpit, with an ulterior motive. \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is about competitive and materialistic neighbors.<br /><br />If you want to read something really unusual from Sedaris, namely fiction, then check out this book, otherwise buy one of his other books for his more typical fare.
B0029O08WA|5.0|The songs are a good indacatioin for how the movie will be. My girls love it as well as i do.
B002MW50KO|4.0|This album may not be the best Dylan album and I agree there could have been a more interesting song selection. But the fact of the matter is that this album has already generated about 2,000,000 meals for hungry people across the country and will continue to do so as long as people are buying it. What have you done to stop hunger and help your fellow man? Probably nothing. So you can just sit there and complain about how this album isn't Dylan's best or you can pour yourself and your loved ones a cocktail, kick back to a quirky holiday record and figure out a creative way you all can give to those who need help. Its not Blood on the Tracks, or Planet Waves, or Time out of Mind or Hwy 61 and its not intended to be. Its a christmas record. And a damn fun one at that. So buy it and be merry!
0439023483|4.0|Please allow me to say first, in a clear head-nod to the author, that this is an intense, gripping, and meaningful book.  It is a high quality work of fiction that deserves accolades and admiration.  This book and its sequel make emotionally resonant points about government and economy without any hint at preaching.  Not only does this book project a terse yet believable heroine who we grow to cringe with and root for, but the book clutches us to itself and hurtles us through its pages.      BUT . . . this is not children's literature.  Nor is it even teenage literature.  This is a violent, emotionally-wrenching book that will make even adults wince and feel their stomachs twist.  The point of view is from a first person perspective.  We see and hear, through a sixteen-year old's eyes and thoughts, children dying.  A number of children.  Blood spatters and kids die in explicit, violent deaths in a gladiatorial-type setting over dozens and dozens of pages.      Please understand that I am not an ultra-conservative, nor am I in favor of keeping books out of kids' hands.  I believe that this book (and its sequel) are valuable books that deserve the awards and praise they have received.      But this is not for children.
B000HLDFK4|4.0|The movie \\"The Lake House\\" is certainly a movie that challenges you to suspend your disbelief but it seems a majority of people seem incapable of doing so for this movie, yet are able to believe that a mystical force controls all things in the Universe (Star Wars), that a man can fly (Superman) or, gasp, that a truck can turn into a robot (Transformers).<br />For me this movie is pure fantasy and I have no problem taking it for what it is - namely a romantic movie with a supernatural element. I don't sit there and try and figure out how or why the mailbox works the way it does just like I don't sit there and wonder how the Enterprise reaches warp speed (Star Trek) or the man outraces the Sun (Mummy Returns).<br />The plot is basically a love story and rather than two people falling in love over the internet and e-mail they instead do it the old fashioned way and fall in love through snail mail. However the device of the time difference means that the two cannot simply meet face-to-face in a traditional date. The plot reminded me of a similar plot device in a TV movie I saw where two lovers corresponded the same way across centuries with the letters magically appearing in an old cabinet.<br />Take the movie for what it is and pick up this enjoyable, charming romantic movie on Blu-ray for under $10 (as of Nov. 13, 2009). The audio and video quality are far from steller, but they are better than on an upconverted DVD.

If you have any interest in the various genres this film touches on you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

1573229725|4.0|I should have loved this book, it has everything--wonderful atmospherics, beautiful written language, well defined characters, and plot (and plot twists) out the wazoo!  My wife finished this book, and loved it so much, she immediately went out and bought all of Sarah Waters' other books.<br /><br />I admired this book, I was impressed by it, I understood the praised heaped on it, but I didn't love it--for one reason:  There was no character I really cared about, no character I rooted for, no character that touched me, no character that emotionally drew me in.  Each of the characters (every single one) was shown as selfish, weak, immoral, cowardly or flawed in some respect.  I couldn't sympathize for those characters who were treated badly by life, as each was shown to have their own questionable motives.  As such, I felt myself the outsider, much like passing a car accident on a distant highway--interested enough to look, but not really touched by the fate of the passengers.<br /><br />All of this having been said, this is a well written book, a fun read, a wild ride--although without the human connection, without the emotional connection, one I suspect I will quickly forget.

The picture quality is amazing, the sound is pure as driven snow, and the amount of content in this release is incredible.<br /><br />The only downside, of course, is the lack of an audio CD to complement the Blu-Ray. This is unclear from the description of the product on this page and is the only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars.

0788861948|4.0|The first season of Grey's Anatomy shows you how the show began.  It focuses on Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her relationship with Derek Shepard (Patrick Dempsey), who turns out to be the head of neuro, and the other interns during their first year of interning at Seattle Grace Hospital.  The other major characters include Meredith's best friend Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Meredith's friend and roommate Isobele \\"Izzie\\" Stephens (Katherine Heigl), Meredith's friend and roommate George O'Malley (TR Knight), Meredith's (eventual) friend Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Meredith's resident (supervisor) Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), head of cardio surgeon and (eventually) Cristina's boyfriend Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), and Chief of Surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.).<br /><br />I agree with one of the other reviewers that this and season 2 are the best seasons.  The other seasons are fun to watch too, but they're a bit more dramatic than the first two seasons.  Honestly, if you stopped watching at the end of season 3, you haven't missed much.

It stays on course for the most part though does have a few twists.  I was looking for a better finale.  The fight scenes and each individual's abilities may be a bit of a stretch nonetheless, it was an interesting read.    LORD Bless  Scott

B002MW50KO|1.0|As a matter of full disclosure, I am not a big Bob Dylan Fan. I have always admired Dylan's songwriting talent... agreeing with many music critics and his legions of hard-core fans, that he is an extraordinary poet and social commentator. That said, this may very well be the worst Christmas album ever recorded by a major music artist. While I can understand that Dylan's voice is appealing (or at least passable) to many of his life-long, hard-core fans, for those of us who have listened to his more recent albums with objectivity, his voice has become increasingly more difficult to stomach.    At least with his newer original material, many non-hardcore fans can still respect and appreciate his songwrititng talents and get beyond his increaingly strained, weary and gravelly voice. But to hear Bob Dylan clearly straining to sing beloved Christmas Classics like, \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\", \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\", \\"O' Come All Ye Faithful\\", \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"Christmas Song' and \\"O' Little Town of Bethlehem\\" made me cringe repeatedly with each warbling syllable. Dylan's, embarassing take on (the album closer) \\"O' Little Town of Bethlehem\\" has to go down as one of the most unlistenable Christmas tracks that I have ever heard. Unless you are a diehard Bob Dylan fan, you more likely than not will want to steer clear of this holiday music train wreck.

B000ADWDF2|5.0|Once upon a time in Denmark, there was a good brother and a bad brother.<br /><br />When we meet them, Jannik, the bad brother, is just getting out of prison --- he's such a screwup he failed even at bank robbery.<br /><br />Michael, the good brother, has a beautiful wife, two perfect daughters and a purpose: He's an Army officer about to go to Afghanistan to direct a reconstruction program.<br /><br />And the good brother leaves, and, right off, his helicopter is shot down in Afghanistan, and an Army representative has the unhappy duty of knocking on the door of his home and delivering the ultimate bad news to his wife.<br /><br />The grieving is intense. And ugly. The father of the brothers stands six inches from the face of his bad son and announces, \\"Now I have nothing.\\"<br />I would crumble. But the bad son rallies. There's a void that needs to be filling, and he steps up. Plays with the little girls. Builds new kitchen cabinets.

Are they pleasant to watch? Not in the way you're used to. They don't go out of their way to deliver happy endings. There's no stirring, manipulative soundtrack to make the big moments familiar. But these movies do something that most films don't --- they have you on the edge of your seat, and for more than a few minutes during a big action scene.<br /><br />These movies work precisely because they're so tough to watch --- in the way, that is, that real life can be tough. The trouble the characters are in, it's real trouble, not movie trouble. A soldier brings the war home. Happens every day. And we imagine what that's like for his wife, their kids, friends and family --- but we have no clue. Because every veteran is different.

0307269981|4.0|I just finished the second book in \\"The Girl\\" series by Steig Larsson, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"<br /><br />Resurrecting the two main characters from the previous book, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, this suspense novel centers around the death of an investigative journalist and his partner.<br /><br />He was writing about exposing high-ranking officials who were participating in white slavery while his partner was writing her Ph.D. dissertation on the same topic. Blomkvist's magazine, The Millenium, agrees to publish the book and has retained the journalist on staff.<br /><br />Interestingly, and a sadly prophetic turn of events, Blomkvist comes to a point in the novel where he must decide whether he will continue to publish the novel despite the deaths of the researcher and author.<br /><br />In the mean time, Lisbeth is making a new life for herself after Blomkvist broke her hard little heart. Turning 25 and wealthy after hacking into a corrupt corporate mogul's overseas bank accounts, she has stifled her sadistic court-appointed guaridan and has taken to traveling the world over the next year.<br /><br />But when she returns to Sweden she finds that the court-appointed guardian seems to now be seeking revenge.<br /><br />I found this book to be far superior to the first one.<br /><br />First, the translation was better and not so stilted as the first one, making for a more fluid novel. Also, Lisbeth is far more sympathetic in this novel. In the previous novel, she comes off as a bit of an android. Which, is typical if you have Asperger's Syndrome, as she does. In this one, her character starts to losen up and Larsson seems to have found his inner female voice.<br /><br />In this novel Larsson starts to dissect her personality and delve into her character, all which become pivotal to the mystery.<br /><br />Brilliantly plotted, I did not have an inkling to the solution until about 3/4's of the way through and then I still was not quite sure how it was all going to end.<br /><br />This is the second novel in a 6-series set.

B000ZECQ08|4.0|First off, I gave it 4 stars because compared to the other movies, it was closest to the book, even if they did do some stupid changes to it. Plus, I love Harry Potter, and am a HUGE fan of all books and movies. However, the reasons below are why it did not get 5 stars.      ATTENTION!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!    I have to agree, that there were many things about this movie that was really, really disappointing. The scenes left out, most disappointing, can we get a movie that at least sticks to the books entirely? The scenes added...burning the Burrow down, honestly, what the hell was the person who thought that up smoking? It leaves so many open questions as to how well they are going to do the next two movies.     The pensive/Dumbledore's lessons were not given enough time. In the seventh book, the pensive plays an important role in how Harry comes to realize Severus Snape was really on his side, and truly had cared for his mother, which plays a role in the final fight against Voldemort. Not to mention, showing Harry the reasons why Dumbledore did what he did.    Burning down of the Burrow means that they are either NOT going to show the scene where they get Harry from the Dursley's to the Burrow, or they are going to change it. Plus, they will either change or leave out the wedding, which means they will need to change how they show that the ministry has fallen. In turn, that means changing most of the facts from the movie, including how the death eaters catch Harry, Ron and Hermione, since saying \\"Lord Voldemort\\" made the enchantments break due to the death eaters in the ministry making it so. Not to mention Rufus Scrimgeour (minister of magic) dying and to Harry's surprise, protecting him and not revealing his whereabouts. How in the world are they going to have anything at the Burrow with it burnt down? And if they are going to have the Burrow in the next movie, it means an unnecessary scene of explaining how the damn thing is still there, which they will HAVE to do since putting that scene in. It was entirely unnecessary to have the Burrow burn down, even if they did have the death eaters show up there.... Oh, and at the wedding is when we are first introduced to the deathly hallows, the sign on Xenophilius Lovegood's robes, and Viktor Krum introducing the first of the backround that they find out about it. It does play a role as well in their 'quest' in the 7th movie.    Okay, enough on that scene, what about adding the beginning in like that...he was supposed to be waiting for Professor Dumbledore at the Dursleys..Dumbledore had much, and I mean much to say to the Dursleys, including reprimanding them for not treating Harry as he had asked them to. Plus, he tells Harry of him owning Grimwald place and Kreacher. Hmm, doesn't a big chunk of the 7th book take place at Grimwald palace..I see more unnecessary scenes added in the 7th movie.     Scrimgeour not in the movie at all..not even mentioned...what about when they give Harry, Hermione and Ron the inheritance??? Are they really adding a scene to explain who he freaking is??? Seems like they will be adding a lot more to the 7th to explain things they messed up in the first 6. (Meeting of the muggle minister isn't as important, but I would have liked to see it closer to the books. For some reason, when they make movies, they think completely changing it will make it better, and it never is...when will they learn...)     \\"Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)\\" I quote this because I totally agree, again, mistakes made that true fans are noticing, and it does nothing but discredit the makers of the movies as being egotistical and arrogant enough to think we would like their version so much better when it leaves so many holes.....      Harry and Ginny's first kiss was pathetic and should have been done the way the book shows since Ginny IS Ron's sister, and the consent from Ron, being Harry's best friend, was important. Plus, they left out Harry breaking up with Ginny at the end and that was definitely important. Again, egotistical directors, screen writers, etc...    The Gaunt house memories and Voldemort's reason for the locket becoming a Horcrux are gone....as well as the memories of Helga Hufflepuff's cup and Voldemort asking Dumbledore for a teaching position....    Snape's \\"Defense Against the Dark Arts\\" lessons...ummm hasn't it been a point in all the other movies that he's wanted this position, and then they don't show it when he has it...IDIOTS!!!      Harry finds Mundungus Fletcher stealing property from grimwald place, and it's important for the next movie because he steals the locket. And they must track it down, which leads us back to Umbridge having Moody's eye on her door and the locket. She also attends Dumbledore's funeral, which they left out. Which would have included Scrimgeor talking to Harry about him helping the ministry. Which they didn't show at all in the movie, and which is very, very important!    Harry finding out that Snape was the one that betrayed his parents to Voldemort by telling him the prophecy was extremely huge... and they don't mention it. In fact, Snape's role is very, very small compared to what his role in the book was. He should have had a little more limelight as trying to help Draco, and Harry and Snape issues and finally Dumbledore and Snape's plans and issues...nothing....     Harry being stupified by Dumbledore in the end to protect him was key as 1)that's why he was disarmed and 2)come on, Harry just sit by and watch them kill Dumbledore...that wasn't believable at all....     The death eaters fighting those at Hogwarts...not one scene....     THEY TOOK OUT DUMBLEDORE'S FUNERAL!!! SERIOUSLY?????      HOWEVER!! As far as comparing to the other movies, it is closest to the book, I must say than the others, just wish some KEY things would not have been skipped or changed.
0786868724|5.0|I purchased two copies of \\"Have A Little Faith\\", by Mitch Albom, from Amazon.com shortly after its release. They were received in a timely manner.  Knowing Rabbi Lewis was like having your favorite piece of candy.  He was a wise owl who knew how to make you feel good with his little ditties and stories.  His family and congregation, both old and young, were the light of his life.  The author tried to capture him in his little book and did well, however Rabbi Lewis' story could be made into a novel right until the end when those present at his funeral heard his OWN words.  Detroit Paster Covington's tale truly tells the story of how one can move up from his darkest side. He took his life, recognized his faults and turned a bad situation upside down. His humble ways are to be commended.    I gave a copy of this book to a neighbor who read and enjoyed it immensly.  She returned from her church service on All Saints Day and told me this was the focus of the sermon.  The wrap up screamed the words of something Rabbi Lewis might have said...\\"It doesn't matter what religion you are, everyone needs to have a little faith.  Thank you, Mitch Albom, for writing a timeless story that confirms that statement.

B0015AARJI|3.0|This is a great solid little controller however the fact that it does not come with a USB cable to charge it is a rip off.  If two of you are playing away all night only one controller can charge at a time which is incredibly annoying as the markup on cables in the store are almost as expensive as the controller.<br /><br />Including a $0.50 cable is something that should have been done.  Very disappointed that they didn't.<br /><br />Other than that though the controller feels good in my giant hands and the rumble feature works well.  Still getting the hang of the layout as I've not touched a PS style controller for several years but does very well.
0517543052|5.0|It's a MUST READ book. It will suck you in like nothing you've read before. It starts with Dr. Richard Alpert talking about his work with Tim Leary at Harvard and the psychedelic experiment..all legal at the time. Gradually he realizes he needs \\"more\\". His eyes were opened but it didn't connect anything, he was dangling, needing to know how to \\"index\\" this new awareness. The he goes to India and meets a 24 yr. old hippie-guru from Laguna Beach who takes him on a jouney to meet the REAL guru in the Himalayas. That's when you put your seatbelt on. He takes you on an amazing, compelling and emotional trnsformation through Eastern philosophy that has to make you look at life just a little differently, at the least!

0385247125|4.0|I enjoyed getting some insight into how Michael Jackson thinks (creatively) and feels (intensely).  Although maybe not completely truthful, I did get the feeling that he was being fully honest.  Just as two people can walk away with two distinct impressions of the same event, Michael opened up as much as could be expected as someone talking to an acquaintance about some intensely personal moments of the previous 25 years.  Some protective veils come in now and then, and some twisting of truths of what he wished would have been.  But overall an interesting look at the man who had such a huge impact on pop music.

0060558121|3.0|American Gods could have been hilarious - but it wasn't.  It could have been thought provoking - but it wasn't.  It could have been socially relevant - but it really wasn't. There were numerous threads that could have given this more mileage that just weren't exploited.  The protagonist was a rather two dimensional character who spent the entire story reacting to the outrageous events around him, in sort of a heroic way, but was never really conflicted.  The entire perspective on American life and culture is from an observer's standpoint, and just didn't resonate with me, born and raised in America.  An American could have given a more multi-dimensional treatment of the experience of the old-world Gods, and the subtle effect of the techno-Gods.  There was no under current that allowed the reader to fully understand, appreciate and internalize the source of the power of the Gods, which would have allowed the reader to appreciate how the story was developing toward the end.  Instead, the reader was swept along with the protagonist, bewildered as he was, and just a little bit disappointed in the ending, which had an interesting twist which, again, wasn't exploited as well as it could have been.
B000GIXIBY|4.0|Halloween got me in the mood for Army of Darkness, so shortly after I bought this one off Amazon.    I don't own a HD DVD player, so this is a review of the DVD side.  In fact, this combo format version was cheaper than the regular DVD version (go figure).    Under \\"Customer Images\\" on this page, there are some images that compare the DVD side of this release to the Anchor Bay release ([[ASIN:B00001ODHJ Army of Darkness]])    The images supplied are helpful because they address 2 things:    1) The video on the Universal release (HD/DVD Combo) does have more in frame on the left/right sides of the screen, but a little bit is cropped on the top and bottom (in comparison to the Anchor Bay release)    2) As the images show, the colors on the Universal release are a bit brighter.  On the Anchor Bay DVD, the colors are much cooler.  The comparison pictures are a little exaggerated in my opinion though, I think Universal did a very good job with it.  The daylight scenes are crisp and vibrant, and the night shots capture the original \\"cool\\" colors very well too.    If you're looking for a good DVD version of AOD, this is one of the best.  If you want special features however, this is not the right DVD for you.

B001WCN232|5.0|I remember when this album was 1st released and how excited i was to play it...Some of the tracks were over my head for my age at the time  like, Can you hear the music, Coming Down Again, but others rocked like no other album, Star Star, 100 years ago and Heartbreaker..  This album also has one of the most beautiful ballads of all time, Angie. And a very nice slower track Winter...  But when this kind of \\"dark\\" and a little laid back album was released on Cd back in 1986 the sound became \\"muddy\\" and even darker...Almost to becoming boring...    This New Remaster brings this album back to life.. Songs that i never liked, i now love....(Coming down again, Can you hear the music).  It is now much cleaner and less \\"muddy\\" sounding allowing you to NOW hear every note that Mick Taylor plays...Wow  it sounds even better then it did when it was on a lp!    The biggest problem some say is how they changed or bleeped a word from Star Star...This was why i waited to buy this cd...My copy the words are the same as on the lp which is great news.    This remaster is well worth the price for a classic album! It brings back what the Stones were trying to do in the studio by not just making another Pop album.. It is a album ahead of its time back in   1973 and now we can finely hear it! Its like a Fine art restored and made New again...

It defines the true meaning of science, and gives a logical case for how origins cannot be proven with science.  This is a must read for everyone who has been taught decent with modification, whether you believe it or not.

B000F2C7TU|5.0|Coverdale has one of the best hard rock blues voices ever and I'm a fan who appreciates the band's late 70's through mid 80's work and I don't shun there late 80's heyday cause that's still some damn fine Rock N Roll!      1. Long Way From Home- Beautiful way to start the album very slow and show's off Coverdale's great voice also a killer solo by Mr. Moody 5/5    2. Walking In The Shadow Of The Blues-  A Hard fist pumping rock track with some kick ass bass by Neil Murray man what an underrated bass player Dowle give's some nice drum surprises on this one and Coverdale's voice is at it's peak another classic Whitesnake song 5/5      3. Help Me Thro' The Day- Man this is some baby making music right here! Almost on par with Marvin Gaye or Barry White written by Leon Russell of coarse the slow bass and drum beat make a sweet and sexy love song excellent 5/5    4. Medicine Man- Neil own's this song he play's some killer bass lick's he make's this a great song the guitar rift sound' kind of similar to Fool For Your Loving.. Or maybe that's just me(:    5. You N' Me- A Little bit of a weak point after the excellent beginning four tracks, The song's not bad just nothing special in the musician department Coverdale still shines though 4/5    6. Mean Business- Starting with some cool guitar effects one of the fastest song's on the album at a furious pace excellent song Dowle, Mick, David, Marsden  & Lord are at the top of there game here 5/5    7. Lovehunter- My personal favorite song on the album great lyrics and top production by the boys and the drum breakdown is beautiful I love it! A Rock N Roll/Blues classic 5/5    8. Outlaw- A Great hard rock track with some of the best lyrics on the album I like Coverdale's screaming on this one very emotional 5/5    9. Rock N Roll Woman- A Fine outro Coverdale love's woman and here he professes his love with a Blues attitude the rest of the boys play this song with ease going into a killer solo and finale a good way to end the album     10. We Wish You Well- Despite David's powerful vocals here this song is really not needed and feel's to much like a filler beside's the fact that it's under two minutes 3/5      Lovehunter in my opinion a lost blues/rock classic definitely worth a look

1416549447|1.0|I have been a barefoot runner since 2005, at which time I re-learned how to correctly run using my awareness and the teachings of numerous sources.  I have read Danny Dryer's ChiRunning book and watched his ChiRunning DVD.  I have also studied The Pose Running Technique on DVD and the workbook.  In addition, I have experience practicing Qi Gong (Chi Kung), meditation, and yoga.  I have also studied anatomy, posture, The Alexander Technique, and Rolfing Structural Integration.  My partner is also a Chinese Medicine professional and Acupuncturist.  So basically, I know a thing or two in this field...<br /><br />In light of the acclaim that Danny Dryer is receiving for his ChiRunning technique, there are some critical errors and marketing misperceptions that I feel should be addressed.  I base these insights on my own personal experience and my extensive research into natural running techniques and chi energy.<br /><br />1. This book does not at all use the chi (qi) energy for running.  Dryer teaches a method of using gravity to encourage the body to move through space.  After reading and watching Dryer's published material, it is clear to me that he uses the term \\"chi\\" as a marketing strategy.  All things eastern - yoga, tai chi, etc - are hot selling points these days.  Yes, Dryer states that he has practiced Qi Gong under a teacher.  However, nowhere in the DVD or book does he teach about the movement of chi the body, its pathways or its functions.  Dryer should have title his technique \\"Gravity Running\\" instead.<br /><br />2. Dryer combines a commonly misunderstood Pilates technique (tightening the core), claming it to be engaging the \\"hara\\" or \\"dan tien / tan tien\\".  While the dan tien is the chi energy center below the navel, never are core muscles used when working with this center.  Tightening any muscles will take a person's awareness away from the energy and into the muscular contraction sensation.  Contracting muscles may create heat which is often believed to be chi by many beginners, however heat and chi are very different.<br /><br />In the original Pilates technique, as taught by Joseph Pilates, only the largest, deepest muscles of the core are \\"engaged\\" not tightened.  This is more akin to placing the awareness in the core while using only the softest tension.  Most people misunderstand Pilates and tighten the abdominal muscles which then causes improper posture.  Watching the ChiRunning DVD and observing Danny Dryer's posture, it is clear that his posture is far from ideal.  Improper core tension and running technique could possibly be the cause of this, however other causes could also exist.<br /><br />3. Dryer teaches to tighten the core muscle to tilt the pelvis. This lengthens the lower back, thus straightening the spine and removing the natural curve.  By straightening the natural curve, the natural spring in the spine is removed leading to possible spine injury.  Watching the DVD clearly shows the postural flaw caused by this unnatural movement.  I am very suprised to see the noticably poor posture that Dryer and his students showed in this instructional video.<br /><br />Also, by tightening the core muscles, excess tension is created in the body that will interfere with the body's natural movement.  By creating tension in the core, the entire body is adversely affected because the core is the body's center of gravity and the psoas muscles in the deep core extend into the legs and upper back and ribs.  Tension in the core will also restrict the rig cage's ability to expand sufficiently to allow proper oxygen in the lungs.<br /><br />4. Landing on the middle of the foot works against the anatomy of the foot.  The arch of the foot acts like a rubber band that allows the foot to spring forward when running on the ball and toes.  Running with the middle of the foot first causes the ball and head to hit at the same time, causes jarring sensations in the foot, ankle, and leg.<br /><br />As seen in the photos in the book and in the DVD video, Dryer wears modern full cushion running shoes that elevate the heal.  Ask any expert in anatomy and/or Olympic-level running will teach, these shoes are injuries waiting to happen.  A person can only get an accurate anatomical running experience by learning to run barefoot.  Barefoot running quickly shows us how to correctly run.  We can then return to running in shoes in a safer, more natural and more energy efficient way.<br /><br />5. Danny Dryer encourages the runner to tilt the body forward, taking the work off of the muscles and letting gravity act as a source of propulsion.  Yes, this does work.  However this style of running does not make effective use of the muscles and creates a very awkward experience that does not feel natural.  Observe the running style of the world's greatest Olympic athletes and you will see all long distance runners stand erect while landing on the ball and toes of the feet.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you have read this far into my review, you may be left looking for a solution.  My best recommendation is to read the book Running Fast and Injury Free by Gordon Pirie.  Pirie has held many world records and Olympic medals.  He is one of few runners who, in my opinion, has perfected the art of running.  His principles are based upon a lifetime of learning from top Olympic runners and beating nearly all of them or their records.  Since age 14, Pirie ran with Olympic record holders. In addition, Dr. Nicholas Romanov's Pose Method of Running contains value insights into the physiology of running.<br /><br />Above all else, since most of us grew up in shoes, we must re-teach ourselves to walk and run as the body's design intends.  We must learn to move barefoot.  Even if we choose to run every race in shoes, learning to run while barefoot is a necessary part of the process.  So find a soft stretch of dirt, sand, grass, sidewalk or road and get started.  Skip 99.9% of the theory and get back to the reality of running.  Use your mind to observe your body and make corrections as you go.  And above all else - have fun!he book and in the DVD video, Dryer wears modern full cushion running shoes that elevate the heal.

0316010669|5.0|In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell outlines numerous stories to illustrate how our brain can reach conclusions without our conscious mind realizing how we came to that answer.  Demonstrating instances of experts detecting forgeries, psychologists determining whose marriages will last, and how we can learn to read people's faces, Gladwell weaves these stories together to show why our first judgement may be our best, and how detrimental it can be to try figuring out why or how we \\"just know\\".  It was interesting to learn the key to good improvisational comedy, what makes a good car salesman, and how people perceive to what degree they will like a food based on the packaging.  If textbooks were this interesting and well written, kids would be chomping at the bit to do their homework!
B001B71NOI|4.0|As the last album in a striking creative streak, it's inevitably for the Slip to get some flak.  The albums preceding it were much longer and relied more upon lyrical narrative and complex musical structure.  Year Zero told a story much like the Downward Spiral Had, With Teeth attempted to be usual NIN fare, while Ghosts was in a league of its own.  All in all, With Teeth, Year Zero, and Ghosts represented almost FIVE hours of music total, all released in the span of a couple years.  So, it's no wonder that the Slip may seem paltry in comparison- it's stripped-down garage rock sound certainly doesn't help either.<br /><br />However, after multiple listens, the Slip has started to sound superior to Year Zero and With Teeth for me (Ghosts isn't even worth comparing, it's an entirely different animal), and is even becoming one of my favorite NIN albums.  Reznor tries new things in the Slip, and at the same time it harkens back to Broken-era NIN, if only for its lack of restraint.  From the opening tracks thru Lights in the Sky, the album is almost entirely straight-up rock and roll dissonance.  The first track \\"999,999\\" serves as a tense lead up to<br />\\"1,000,000\\" which charges forwards with aggressive, fast-paced electronics accompanied by live drums (either that or live-sounding drum samples).  Reznor's voice even sounds upbeat in an Iggy Pop sort of way, which contrasts nicely with his usual red-hot lyrical angst.  These \\"rock\\" tracks may not have the complexity or depth NIN has displayed in the past, but it's undeniable that they are well-written, catchy, and energetic.  The album's second phase starts with \\"Lights in the Sky,\\" one of the most beautiful piano pieces the man has ever written.  \\"Corona Radiata\\" and \\"The Four of us are Dying\\" are both adventurous ambient pieces that lack the emotional heaviness that previous NIN instrumentals have been caked in.  They fit well with the rest of the album despite their stylistic differences, largely because they sound more exotic than moody.  Finally, the album caps off with one final rocker, \\"Demon Seed.\\"<br /><br />The Slip is uniquely digestible for a NIN album, and probably deserves praise based on that alone.  Along with its fun, NIN-lite style, it also lacks the excesses and hiccups detectable on Year Zero and With Teeth.  Overall, it is remarkably good for a free album, much like Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows.\\"  More importantly, it's an album that lives up to NIN's long and varied creative legacy.than moody.

B001EO748M|5.0|Buy this series. You will not regret. Ten episodes all told of sterling drama. Some of the historical accuracy's no doubt been lost to artistic license and gloss, but the characterisation is strong and scripts excellent. So this series develops like a spicy historical novel with interesting, fully motivated characters and powerful dramatic moments in each episode. I think you'll be riveted as I was and taken aback by in particular the culmination of the series, which I found so very, very impressive. Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn absolutely excels. Through season 1 and most of season 2, our sympathies lie not in the least with Anne Boleyn, and in fact we're glad to see the scheming bitch removed to the Tower prior to her execution. But through the last hours of her life, when we are forced to concede her innocence and acknowledge her as the victim of a stitch-up, then our sympathies switch completely and so much so that I for one was deeply touched by her plight. There is such a tender moment in her final hours when she's kneeling praying in the darkness for her mortal soul while at the same time reminiscing of a carefree childhood, playing hide and seek with her father and brother in a beautiful sun-lit garden. The contrast between her dark prison cell and horrible predicament and the garden of her childhood is so pronounced and set to such an unforgettably beautiful piece of music, that tears are very likely to well in the eyes. Herein is a masterpiece of direction and such wonderful acting by Natalie Dormer. What was understood by the writer, the actors, and the director was that this was not merely a simple fact of English history, i.e that Henry VIII's second wife Anne Boleyn lost her head, but that this event was an enormous atrocity which echoes through the ages and concerned a living breathing woman being used, abused and destroyed by one of the most selfish men in history.
0765350386|5.0|I was very weary about reading this book as I had just finished the Assassin's Apprentice by Hobb and I was afraid no book that I ever read would add up to that series. I was surprised with this book. It had constant action, constant plot development, strong and unique characters, a well shaped and thought out world, and a great story line. I really couldn't put this book down. It as very action packed and I loved the different type of magic that the author came up with. I loved this book.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|This is one of the best CD's of any genre music that I own. I'm not a big country fan but I have always liked Merle , Waylon Jennings , and Johnny Cash. This is as excellent a compilation of Merle's work that you will find. The recording is outstanding and there is not a bad selection on this long CD. I tell all the kids I teach who like contemporary country, which sounds like imitation Southern Rock to me , about this CD. I listen to this CD constantly and never get tired of it. This is what real country music is supposed to sound like.
0071636080|5.0|Today's business environment is so cluttered with messages, pitches, copy-cats, and general information overload that many new and fresh ideas sit in obscurity. The need for individuals to communicate and influence others is more critical in an age of sound bytes and 24/7 headlines.<br /><br />Presenting your ideas with purpose and meaning is at the heart of Carmine Gallo's book, The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How To Be Insanely Great In Front of Any Audience. Modeling off Steve Jobs (the icon), Gallo successfully deconstructs the formula for making any presentation a winner. Whether you're objective is to pitch a product or service, or advance your career, the simple elements described in the book can be applied by anyone at any level.<br /><br />Gallo teaches you how to rise up through the noise. For example, he outlines the back-end processes such as planning with paper and pencil to craft your story. It's not about the beautiful PowerPoint slidedeck - it's about convincing people why they should care about you. Without that (mixed in with strong dose of personal passion) you go nowhere. In the workplace success goes to the evangelist who creates the roadmap that gets everyone's buy-in. This is true of leaders as well as individual contributors.<br /><br />Gallo goes on to layout how to present information in digestible chunks suggesting the use of headlines and Twitter length messages to create key points that stick.  In other words, if you build the experience they will come. Seems simple enough, but many of us trip over ourselves trying to get the task part of our pitch down and overlook the heart of the message. People gravitate to you when you can solve a problem and create a change and that's what Steve Jobs does and so can you.<br /><br />My review copy of this book is riddled with highlighter and post-its. Every chapter has a plethora of gold knowledge nuggets that I will be practicing every chance I get. True to Gallo's style, the book is formatted with chapter end summaries (Director Notes) and an easy to follow flow and format.

B002GYVRRI|3.0|I got this album for the surround sound, primarily - I loved the Genesis and Porcupine Tree surround mixes, and am looking forward to the surround sound remixes of the other King Crimson albums. I really loved the surround sound mix on this, one of my favorite albums ever! It's a very original mix, with the idea of the guitar, often the main instrument, often coming from behind ...     So why not 5 stars? When the DVD goes from the 1st to the 2nd track, it halts, then re-plays the last few seconds of the first track again, whereas these two tracks should segue. It's hard to believe nobody caught this glitch before it went out. I think they should issue replacement disks to the customers who bought this. Really, it's kind of disgraceful. You shouldn't have to listen to an album with an obvious, obnoxious error like that on it. Minus one star.    Another thing (another minus one star): when I first received this album, it either refused to play, or skipped (note that the above glitch was present on that copy, also). I alerted amazon, and they *kindly* sent me a replacement copy, which is working fine, apart from the glitch issue. However, my copy of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" just arrived, and it is displaying the EXACT same behavior! It either won't play, or skips. I've never experienced this with any DVD, so I hardly doubt it's my player. It seems to me that the odds of this happening to two disks successively are very slim, suggesting that these DVDs might be badly and cheaply printed.    Careful, customer. These are wonderful 5.1 remixes, and I highly recommend this to anyone who loves surround sound - but see if you can see stories like mine. Reader, if you *do* have a similar story, please do not hesitate to post.     To the diehards: apologies for lowering the average rating.
0810983915|5.0|my 9 year old daughter thinks she hates to read.  being an avid reader this breaks my heart.  the only books she has ever read by choice...on her own...are the 'diary of a wimpy kid' books.  this one was no different.  i bought the book and took it home.  she literally jumped up and down and started reading.  i wanted to cry with joy.  she finished it in two days even though she had a big load of school assignments.  any book that gets her to read by choice is a winner in my book.  my husband and i even crack up at these books.  they are great.  now i just need to figure out what to get next to keep the momentum going!!

160094048X|5.0|I became interested in vegan baking when I wanted to make something for a vegan friend. I discovered Isa and Terry through their website, and now I am addicted to their cookbooks! Everything I have made (and that is a lot!) has been delicious, and this book is no exception.<br /><br />I'm not even vegan, but it is nice to not have to use eggs and butter in everything. More importantly, these are just plain delicious cookies, and the recipes are so interesting and creative.<br /><br />So far we have made the Blackstrap gingersnaps (chewy and delicious, perfect with tea), the Espresso Chip Oatmeal cookies (they were phenomenal), Banana everything cookies, added cocoa nibs, they were great for snacks. I can't wait to try more.<br /><br />And it's also just a fun book to look through, great size, great photos, fun writing...okay, I like this book. Why are you still reading this? Go and buy it! You will not be sorry.

0061914177|1.0|Gary Vaynerchuk is obviously a very talented guy. He has fantastic taste in wine, and provides his perspective on it and a fresh, contrarian, honest, and entertaining way. His wine store has an excellent and thoughtful selection of wine from all over the world at very competitive prices. And he has managed to use a video blog very effectively to drive lots of online traffic to his wine store while making himself an Internet celebrity in the process.     But why in God's name does he feel a need, nay- a compulsion- to inflict his half-baked, tiresome, vague, platitudinal, and occasionally creepily profane (the speeches, not the book) feelings about business, marketing, and technology on the world? Why does he think that because he himself has succeeded, he can bottle a watered-down abstracted version of his formula and make you, the downtrodden gastro-enterology receptionist who just happens to have an after-hours passion for artisanally handcrafted dustpans rich, famous, and successful?  The charitable side of me thinks he's naive.  The cynical side of me says he knows there's credulous audience out there that will swallow this formula regardless of its validity and make him more famous.    Guess what?  It's another business and marketing self-help motivational advice book, folks!  Another example of that uniquely American phenomenon--a book written by a charismatic successful guy that claims to have the One True System for Everything.  Throw all of your other marketing books away--my simple formula will bring you fame, riches, and happiness!  And based on many of the reviews, another uniquely American phenomenon is repeating itself here: a bunch of less successful people hoping that by blindly and sycophantically swallowing this new formula, they can have their own success via the proximity effect.  I've got a blog about a food product too!  Gary validates my false hope that one day this will give me more than a 1 in 750,000 chance to ever be something more than aminor local celebrity and enough money to pay the DSL bill!       Gary, how can you have such worthwhile things to say about wine, and such worthless things to say about anything else?  Stay in your wine box, little man- you're bumming my trip with your whole broader world view. Did I hear you had a 10-book deal?  Egad.      Sure, I could critique the macro-economic or societal aspects of this business idea. The fact that it ultimately leads to a world where all we spend half our time spewing frenetic fragments into cyberspace and the other half filtering the alternatively, turgid, brilliant, mundane, and toxic brain-farts of others. The image of an economy where instead of just selling each other hamburgers, we sell each other advertising space on blogs where we review each others' hamburgers. The inescapable prevalence of the winner-take-all society, where many strive to achieve celebrity and success, and a tiny select few are rewarded at levels too lucrative to comprehend while the rest labor in poverty, obscurity and/or frustration. The amusing idea that the world has room for more than a handful of true Internet celebrities that sell us niche products in this way.  About 1 per retail category, to be specific.     But I digress. For $12, you could buy a surprisingly good bottle of wine based on an excellent recommendation from Gary's video wine blog. Do yourself a favor and spend your money that way, people. Uncork it.  Pound a glass or two. And then laugh at how silly you would have been to think that a breathlessly written 160-page book with a rhyming title and an exclamation point on the cover could really transform your life and make you wildly successful.

0316044695|4.0|Navy SEALS are a special breed of warriors amongst warriors. Arguably the best trained and toughest of US military, this book shows what these men go through to become SEALs and what it means once you are one.<br /><br />It also gives a very good insight into what is going on today in Afghanistan. It's not all chest beating and patriotism, although there is a lot of that in this book, there is a lot to be learned here.<br /><br />A tough read because of the loss of brave men, young men who gave their all for their country and the price the one survivor pays on an incredible journey. Truth is stranger than fiction. The author/survivor Marcus Luttrell proves that, tries to explain the difficult no win decisions that had to be made. I gave it four stars because he does feel guilty about being the only survivor and the book spends a lot of time justifying what happened. But overall, a definate must read for anyone interested in 'being there' and getting a better idea of what our soldiers do for our freedom.
B002EWD08Q|5.0|Ok first off I have alot of musical intrest. The Artic Monkeys fit somewhere between The Strokes and The Hives in my book. However I also love Queens of the Stone Age, front man Josh Homme produced most of this album at Rancho de la Luna, where the Desert Sessions are Recorded.     Ok now if you know both of these bands you know they sound nothing alike, but this cd is a conjunction of the two. You have a generally slower tempo, darker sound and lyrics, and trippy slide guitar work. The reason I loved the artic monkeys was the same reason I liked the hives, something you could dance to so to speak. Upbeat. I think they probably alienated a lot of listeners who knew them before for this reason. Its just not the same.    Having said all that, musicly i find this cd fantastic. To be honest it did take a few listens, but the lyrics and the perfect timing of subtle guitar riffs will just blow you away. The bass lines are perfectly fit into the music, nothing over powers or is lost in the translation. If I had to put what they did into a phrase it would be: They grew up.
B000068PQ0|4.0|again the lips take a theme and it winds its way thru the songs. crazy sci-fi stuff w robots who are aware they don't have feelings. creative arrangements with crazy sounds create great atmospheric landscapes, and originality out the wazoo. for those who like something different. it definitely takes more than 1 listen for something as different as this.i love this record.
B002V0WN2K|1.0|I own every Bon Jovi record and I thought the last album was as bad as it gets, but the boys just went to a new low.  I'm not sure John really cares about the music anymore, I think it's just a money machine for him now.  I watched the showtime special on Bon Jovi and they just seem to be tired and moving through the steps.  The only reason they have the record selling for $3.99 this week is because they want it to go number one so most people are saying \\"hey for $4 I'll try it how bad can it be?\\".  Well save your money this weekend and go and have a starbucks or get a pull tab at the gas station.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|I Love this album, it has a big springsteen feel even if you can hear prayer in the working for the man.    SOngs are reflective of the economy and state that our country is currently.    Very powerful, and uplifting album.

0767819659|4.0|I'm not a seven year old girl, so it's fair to say I'm probably not the target audience- but the wife is an elementary school librarian, so occasionally I find myself watching a movie I don't believe I'd pick out for myself.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed this movie.  The first fifteen minutes were a bit hard to watch- this is a live action movie that needs to connect with illustrated classic it was made from - so we get the classic lines from the classic books, which verges on chringe-worthy when Madeline says Pooh-Pooh to the tiger in the zoo.<br /><br />Once the homage to the book is made, the movie does much better.  Frances McDormand makes a wonderful Miss Clavel, Pepito is spot on, and Madeline is quite good.<br /><br />The hijinks and high spirited goofs are good, and the adventure that caps the movie is, on the main, believable.<br /><br />Worth watching-

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This beautifully acted and shot film is laced with complex characterizations and complex emotional situations, making it a breath of fresh air in today's increasingly simple cinematic landscape.  Thematically, the movie doesn't necessarily say that people should find a way to forgive or look beyond horrific acts a friend or loved one may have committed, only to make us understand why some people might do so.  To that end, the movie demonstrates how one's personal experience with someone will often trump how we \\"should\\" feel about that person, even if it's clear that the person did some terrible things.  The movie also functions as a methaphor for German society in the post-World War II years, where young Germans were repelled by what their parents and other respected elders did during the war, yet simply couldn't shun and abandon them.  \\"The Reader\\" looks spectacular on standard DVD (the image sports a perfect balance between sharpness and warmth) and there's a generous array of special features that further illuminate the thoughtful, emotional story.  Definitely for mature audiences, \\"The Reader\\" is highly recommended for a night when you're in the mood for something a cut above mere time-passing entertainment.
1932100660|3.0|The quick take home message of this book could be summarized as \\"eat like a Chinese peasant to avoid degenerative diseases.\\"  The author would have you believe that while the Chinese diet is superior to a western diet, you can do even better by becoming a full blown vegetarian, if not a vegan.  He cites a study where animal protein intake is clearly bad over a certain percentage of total calories.  Where he lost his credibility with me was when he made the leap that if too much animal protein was clearly bad, then virtually no animal protein is going to fill you with health, wellness and vitality.  Where on this planet is there any evidence of society of such individuals having thus thrived in the past???  It doesn't exist, because it has never happened.  I agree that a vegetarian diet has been shown to reverse heart disease and it clearly gives the body a break away from the factors that caused heart disease in the first place (though it seems we still aren't exactly sure what part of of a western diet are responsible for the carnage - chlorestorol, homocysteine, a by product of insulin sensitivity, animal protein or a little bit of all of them? - the author seems to be pretty squarely in the chlorestorol and animal protein camps).  And it could be if you're 60 years old and have nutritionally abused your body very badly for your entire life you may well be wise to start eating vegetarian and keep with it for as long as you wish to remain alive.  You've probably got a lot of damage to undo, which will take time.  But clearly a diet with limited animal protein intake - like the Chinese eat - will provide the health, wellness and vitality that most of us would like to achieve, and it will do it with a much broader range of choices of tastes, textures and flavors.<br /><br />All in all, a good book, but it would be far better if not for this one particular leap of illogic.
B002NL9578|3.0|This CD-ROM is more about the philosophy behind SPIN selling rather than providing you with instructions on HOW to actually sell or use the SPIN system (which is the best thing out there).      If you want the best SPIN book on how to do it, get \\"The SPIN selling fieldbook\\" because that will give you actual exercises to do.    The thing I really didn't like about this CD is that there are no tracks on it!  So if you want to advance from one part of a CD to another you've got to fast forward through the whole thing!  Very impractical!

1427202834|5.0|Wow.  Roger Allam is amazing. This was the best audio book I've ever listened to.  His reading was perfect and he created distinct and very engaging characters with his voice alone. This was my first Jeffery Archer book and I was totally gripped by the story of a man who takes on the identity of another in order to avenge a wrong.  There were a lot of twists and turns and interesting characters who were fun to love or hate.  I highly recommend the audio version of this book.  I got it at the library, but I think it's well worth the asking price.  I will look for more Roger Allam audio books.
1416594787|5.0|In the circus show that science has become we have two groups fighting for your attention-- creationists (who often accept many concepts of science as fact) and those that believe in evolution. There's no denying the evidence of evolution the argument according to Dawkins often stems from an interpretation of what is \\"fact\\" and what is \\"theory\\" as he makes clear early on in his The Greatest Show on Earth. According to Dawkins that doesn't mean that you can't believe in God nor does it mean you have to believe in God (Dawkins makes no apologies for the fact that he doesn't believe God is necessary and he's not a big fan of religion either which is pretty evident in his previous book). Dawkins is pretty up front about which ring he's watching.<br /><br />Evolution as Dawkins points out exists independent of what your religious beliefs are but that hasn't satisfied fundamentalists who believe the world is only 10,000 years old, that humans co-existed with dinosaurs and that all of the compelling proof (and if you read the book you'll see that Dawkins provides proof in spades from a variety of different sources)that exists is wrong. Evolution may be the greatest show on Earth but as Dawkins demonstrates it has no short supply of critics. The Greatest Show on Earth presents the scientific facts of evolution with Dawkins pitting them against the theory of creationism.<br /><br />Dawkins points out that there are two definitions of \\"theory\\" and Dawkins distinguishes between them. Definition one used by scientists--\\"A hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed.\\"<br /><br />Number two used by creationists- \\"a hypothesis proposed an an explanation, hence, mere hypothesis, speculation, conjecture; an idea or set of ideas about something; an individual view or notion\\".<br /><br />There in lies part of the intentional disconnect between those who believe in evolution and those that don't and both use their definition as the basis for their point-of-view.<br /><br />Dawkins does a very good job \\"proving\\" that the \\"theory\\" of evolution isn't mere speculation. He provides evidence of natural selection that exists all around us every day and even uses dog breeding as an example of \\"forced\\" selection basically mimicing what natural selection does but focusing on a very specific goal (although I should point out that breeding isn't the same as natural selection). He points out that the natural time clocks reflected in radioactive decay, etc. provide a realistic idea about the passage of time. He cites examples of genetic changes (a good example of forced selection would be the over use of antibotics causing bacteria to develop tools to fight survive in a hostile environment)that are happening in our world today as an example.<br /><br />He also shoots an arrow through the simplistic falicy that we're descendants of modern apes but does point out that we have a common ancestor with chimps. Dawkins points out that having a common ancestor says so much about why so many creatures in our world are similar as well as why they are different. Humans branched off a common tree nothing more nothing less but that doesn't make us chimps nor does it make chimps human.<br /><br />Dawkins book isn't perfect--sometimes his explanations can be unnecessarily complex but, for the most part, Dawkins does an exceptional job tackling a difficult subject that inflames a lot of people.<br /><br />Look, you either believe in evolution or you don't. Evidently 40% of the U.S. population doesn't which to me is frightening. Science and religion don't have to be mortal enemies but extremist thinking and literal interpretation (as Dawkins points out) of the Bible creates an environment where pseudoscience thrives misleading generations of children about the how we came to be.<br /><br />The Greatest Show on Earth probably won't change your mind if you believe in creationism but if you give it a chance it will make those who follow this belief question how rational it is to deny all of the physical evidence that exists demonstrating that evolution happened, continues to happen and will always happen. I doubt that Dawkins book will cause those paying attention to the ring filled with creationist activity to pay attention to the one in the center with all the proof.<br /><br />Highly recommended.mind if you believe in creationism but if you give it a chance it will make those who follow this belief question how rational it is to deny all of the physical evidence that exists demonstrating that evolution happened, continues to happen and will always happen.

B001FB55I0|4.0|I stopped reading the reviews after a while as I was getting tennis neck.  I remember the same reactions to T3 - the purists hated it and the non-fans didn't get it.    This is a popcorn movie.  Check your brain at the door.  It doesn't make good use of the Terminator franchise for sure but complaining about what could have been is pointless.  If you are a sci-fi or T fan this is a worthy bookend just for the visuals.  If you are not very familiar with the T franchise this movie tries to stand on its own with a little narration.  Ironically this movie doesn't actually advance the Terminator mythology at all since it tries too much to stand by itself.    In all cases I think there is something for everyone as long as you remember: this isn't an art film.  Woulda coulda shoulda - doesn't matter.  It is done, this is probably the last movie since the Terminator rights are on the auction block now.  Make peace with it. I liked it for what it was - didn't hate it for what it wasn't.    It's a glass half full thing... ;-)

0307269752|4.0|This mystery novel translated from Swedish takes place on a small island in Sweden which gives it an exotic feeling. The first 80 pages or so sets up the conflict which some may find slow. Many characters are introduced but a family tree in the beginning of the book makes it easy to follow. The story then picks up and at times becomes too much like a Hollywood movie. For those who enjoy fast paced action, they will not be disappointed. There are also a few subplots which makes the book interesting by giving it more dimensions.<br /><br />The book is not really fine literature and the writing (or perhaps the translation) is simple. Nevertheless I was very entertained. For pure entertainment (as opposed to education), I highly recommend it.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|but after a couple spins it really grows on you. W.P.B. is a stellar follow up to the tragically underrated Christ Illusion.  This release finds Slayer experimenting and stretching out.  Tom Araya's vocals even approach singing on a few tracks. These guys are at the top of their collective game. Great playing (lots of lightning fast leads), LOUD drums (Lombardo is mixed high and delivering the goods) and cool tunes.  World Painted Blood keeps getting better with each listen (a true mark of a great album I might add). 5/5

0765316978|2.0|A \\"Hollywood-ending\\" conclusion to what was otherwise a very well thought out series.    If in \\"Old man's war\\" Scalzi introduced us to a harsh universe where humanity has to fight, and fight hard, for every palm of space it wants to colonize, and in \\"The ghost brigades\\" he masterfully blended big strategy and personal conflict down to its resolution by superhero Dirac (who in the end convincingly exemplifies the victory of mind -or spirit- over matter), in \\"The last colony\\" his characters feel like over-powered cast members of a weekly SciFi show, surrounded by red-shirts with no other role in the plot but to die, more concerned with their happy little family than with interstellar affairs.  The big strategy still works, to a point, the exploration of the logic of the imperialistic state starts promisingly and John Perry's banter with friend and foe still mostly shines, but in the end everything falls flat, into cliches, either half done or disappointingly unnuanced.    Cartoonish invulnerable characters, never wrong or in real danger?  Check.  Empowered mommy who always knows best and can kill an army with a fingernail?  Check.  (She reads minds too!)  Pinocchio complex?  Check.  Twice for good measure.  Deus (i.e., Consu) ex machina?  Check!!  The villains are also really good people, inter-racial brotherly love is the latest coolest newest thing and for some unexplained reason even the werewolves disappear halfway thru the book as soon as a little bit of sunlight shines on them. Somehow the \\"harsh\\" universe evolved into this bland experience of cotton candy, unicorns and pregnancies ...

0882709194|5.0|This was originally in the comments thread in one of the reviews. I give it 5 star for reasons that will become obvious, once you read what follows.    Let me explain why this edition from Ray Comfort makes many people very angry. From the time Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" was published 150 years ago, to the present day, it has been assaulted time and again, mainly by the religious. Generations after generations have attacked evolution without ever attempting to even understand it. This is best captured in Darwin's own words, in the opening sentence of Chapter VII, \\"Origin of Species\\": \\"I WILL devote this chapter to the consideration of various miscellaneous objections which have been advanced against my views, as some of the previous discussions may thus be made clearer; but it would be useless to discuss all of them, as many have been made by writers who have not taken the trouble to understand the subject.\\"    We must remember that creation (and not natural selection) was the norm in Darwin's time. Sure... it is not 100% accurate, as some parts have been rejected by modern science. But I would think that the majority still holds true. No scientific theory claims to be able to explain everything. That open problems exist is part and parcel of science. But the important thing is that science is falsifiable, and so is evolution. Just Google \\"falsify evolution\\" to see examples. That for over 150 years, no real evidence have been found to falsify evolution speaks for itself. And if evidence exist that truly falsifies evolution, scientists will be the first to ditch it (or refine it if possible). In contrast, religion is not falsifiable.    Many of the *present-day* (2009) objections have been adequately addressed by Darwin himself, which clearly illustrated the level of understanding of these attackers. Most (if not all) others, that were not capable of being addressed during Darwin's own time, have been adequately refuted in many forums, the best of which (in my opinion) is the TalkOrigins Archive.    If the attackers like Ray Comfort had taken a serious effort to understand the subject, and see objectively the enormous amount of evidence (that will be convincing using just pure common sense - not rocket science), the tons and tons of refutations on previous creationist arguments against evolution, then they would not have repeated all these lies. That they have time and again repeated all these lies after all these refutations clearly demonstrated what dogma can do to an otherwise rational human.    Surely, all Christians would be justifiably angry if some person-of-other-faith were to hijack the Bible and insert an anti-Christian-pro-whatever-religion introduction knowing full well the lies it contains, and conversely. This analogy is just for illustration, and I maintain that evolution is *not* a religion, despite what some creationists have tried to put it. See the falsifiability of evolution indicated above.    One main \\"objection\\" held by creationists is the chance part of evolution. Chance in my opinion, in essence, is \\"what we *currently* do not understand enough to explain concretely\\". We \\"know\\" that a child inherits traits from both parents, and yet we know there is a \\"chance\\" part that is quite inexplicable, like the genius child (eg. Google for \\"Elise Tan-Roberts\\"). We \\"know\\" that women who gave birth in the 40's have a higher chance to have a baby with Down's Syndrome, but we don't *really* know why. It could well be that (hypothetically), a fetus' brain development benefit greatly with a higher temperature during say week 5 of development, and a pregnant mother having a terribly high fever during week 5 of her pregnancy will produce a genius child. We just don't know for sure now, and attribute what we *currently* do not know to \\"chance\\".    I recommend the creationists to read Ray Comfort's introduction. Then go to the TalkOrigins Archive, and see that most (if not all) of the allegations had being smashed down one by one, some quite long ago. If you do indeed have an open mind (as charged by most), then read Darwin's origin \\"Origin of Species\\", decide *afterwards*, if his explanations are more plausible than you had originally thought, or being lead to believe.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|In the movie time goes backwards, but that's a common technique. Everything begins with a boy from Moombai, Jamal Malik (Dev Pootel) participating in \\"Who wants to be a millionaire?\\" Jamal grew up in boondocks and didn't have any education whatsoever. He works as a waitress in a cell company and he shouldn't really know any answers. Seriously what can he possibly know besides how much milk goes into tea.  Lost eyes, no emotions also support the idea and clearly audience makes fun of him. But as the show goes on, showman Kumar has less and less to laugh about, because Jamal answers all the questions he's asked. And when the prize is almost there, Kumar gets obsessed with idea that Jamal is cheating. He thinks that there is no way guy like this can answers the questions that couldn't been answered by educated people with degrees.  They send Jamal to police, where he gets beaten and tortured. There he tells policeman about his life and why he knows the answers. His life was cruel and tough of course. Poor childhood in a Muslim family, murder of his mother by fanatics, loitering with his brother Salil and girl Latika, begging, tough love of him and Latika, betrayal of Salil, mafia and a chance to win 20000000 and find his love. Then goes traditional Indy songs and dances.<br />  Danny Boyl - the director of the movies is original and versatile. Drama about drugattics in \\"'' ''''\\", adventure \\"Beach\\", horror - \\"28 days\\", totally stupid \\"Sunshine\\", and now drama \\"Millionaire\\" where Boyl mixed original Indy movie with a thoroughly planned scheme \\"Movie for Oscar\\". And it worked.  First of all the movie got 8 Oscars plus 75 awards and 26 nominations. Second, with budget of only 15000000(half of which were spent on snacks) it collected 300000000 over the world (almost like a \\"Pulp Fiction\\" back in the days).<br /> The movie isn't bad. The idea of mixing Bollywood and Hollywood is quite interesting. But the real drama didn't happen in my opinion. Boyl created a typically Hollywood fairytale: poor but honest guy takes trails over the years in order to get money, girl and a car (or maybe personal Rickshaw).<br /> The main idea of the movie is that uneducated guy got lucky to know all the answers because of his sad life experience and that can't take any critics. So that's a fairytale although movie is brought as a drama.  Why then all these coincidences? But on the other hand if we assume that the game for a million is a contrast to support the pitiful life in boondocks of Bombay. Boyl was very precise in showing all the horrors of that life.<br />  I don't want to say it's loosely made movie. But all the soap is overrated. His girl was a towel for a mafia boss and then she runs away to a recently rich tea-seller. That's once again for those who likes fairytales or doesn't defy drama from melodrama.<br /> Well, Boyl wasn't orienting on a people like me. People like me wouldn't bring 300000000 for the movie or not even that $15000000 budget. But those people who like fairytales, brought that money. So, Boyl was right.d fairytale: poor but honest guy takes trails over the years in order to get money, girl and a car (or maybe personal Rickshaw).

B000ZECQ08|2.0|As a big fan of the Harry Potter books and also of the movies (up to this point) I found myself tremendously underwhelmed and disappointed by this film. While the performances and overall look of the movie were well done, I don't understand why the choice was made to give such short shrift to:  - the revelation of Snape as the Half Blood Prince  - Dumbledore's death  - Dumbledore's funeral  - the battle scene after the funeral    Ah well. We have Deathly Hallows to look forward to, and though I'm further disappointed that they chose to do it in two films rather than a longer one with an intermission (they used to do that, you know, when attention spans were longer), one can only hope they'll treat the final installment with a little more respect.
0312360266|5.0|I first saw this book in the library in my town. At the time I just finished the Twilight books and was having a hard time finding a good read. I was going to meet my boyfriend and some of our friends then I just happened to look at a poster on their wall(must reads for the summer it said) and there it was...the 1st and 2nd books. When I got home I looked them up and had them ordered that night.     I can't really say what got me hooked. I loved how Zoe went from her everyday life to turning into what she called a freak.   I loved how it was written, but hated some of the words that was used, poopie,come on yeah their 16 but really.
0312360266|3.0|I read a ton of fiction and I really enjoy checking out what is going on in the Teen fiction realm. This is a so/so book. ( I have purchased/read all of them ).  BE AWARE that the book is about the main character growing up in a Christian home and she leaves to worship the pagan goddess Nyx. Now, normally in these teen science fiction paranormal genre, it is alluded to and not always right there in your face.  In this series though, it is really in the forefront...even to the point of the main character being disgusted with a \\"He's the reason for the season\\" Christmas card. ( she celebrates the solstice.)   As a grown adult, I am fine reading through this because it is who the character is...  As a mom of a 13 y.o though...I would not feel real comfortable with that child reading this without some discussion first.  This isn't Twilight by any means...and it isn't to the level of a Richelle Mead, but it was a very easy quick read.  Borrow from a friend or library.

B002HNA95E|5.0|Siempre las recopilaciones resultan un fiasco: mitad del disco con las canciones esperadas y la otra mitad son temas de \\"relleno\\", muy refrescantes para la memoria pero definitivamente poco significativos dentro de la discograf&iacute;a de un artista. Y Madonna no ha sido la excepci&oacute;n a la regla, Inmaculate Collection, la anterior recopilaci&oacute;n de \\"grandes &eacute;xitos\\" de la artista, gener&oacute; mucha expectativa y el resultado final, el que esper&aacute;bamos los fan&aacute;ticos de los 80's, fue bastante decepcionante.

POr el camino pueden encontrarse con esas canciones \\"sexys\\" que identificaron su producci&oacute;n en los 90's, como 'erotica' o 'justify my love' o 'Vogue', el eterno &eacute;xito discotequero.<br /><br />Tres generaciones hemos disfrutado de la m&uacute;sica de la siempre pol&eacute;mica \\"Pop Queen\\" y esta es definitivamente una colecci&oacute;n que vale la pena tener.

B00000I8BX|5.0|\\"Obsolete\\" is simply put, one hell of an amazing album, and it's also one of Fear Factory's best releases as well. This album is a such a powerful and intense futuristic roller coaster of high voltage industrial metal that will litterally take the breath right out of you. I'am a huge fan of Fear Factory. They're truly one of the best metal bands that I enjoy listening to, and even though they've constantly evolved with their sound on every album that they've released, but they still maintained that heavy metal edge that they are best known for, and this album here shows it. \\"Obsolete\\" is a concept album that features a great story which is contained within the music on this album. The story is about the future of mankind and how machines have taken over humanity. This was also inspired by the band's belief that humanity has become too reliant on technology. The band's musicianship is just intense, punishing, and awesome throughout here, and there's also excellent usage of futuristic sounding keyboard effects that really add to the album's sound. Burton C. Bell is one of my favorite metal singers. I really like how he goes from brutal, intense, and monstrous growls and screams that will chew you up and spit you out, to perfectly executed clean sung melodies that'll embrace and envelop your mind. Dino Cazares is an amazing guitarist, firing off brutal, blistering, and crushing riffs that'll rip and shred right through your ears, while drummer Raymond Herrera keeps it heavy and brutal with pummeling beats and thunderous double bass kick work that will keep you banging you head throughout, and bassist Christian Olde Wolbers does an awesome job of putting down basslines that accent both the guitar and drums a great deal.<br /><br />The Songs<br /><br />Every song on this album is just amazing, so there's not really one bad track at all. The opening song \\"Shock\\" is a brutal onslaught right from the get go that boasts pummeling drums, chaotic and punishing riffs, and ferocious screaming along with some nice clean vocals to boot. This is easily one of my favorite songs on here, and that's not all. The next song \\"Edgecrusher\\" (which is also the name of the main character and protagonist of the story) is a catchy and infectious fan favorite that is highlighted by it's catchy and heavy drum beat, blowtorching guitars, and an awesome shout and scream along chorus. Next up, we have \\"Smasher/Devourer\\" which is another one of my favorites here that boasts a savage groove throughout, along with driving, punching guitars, pounding drum beats, and more punishing vocals especially in the chorus where Burton is screaming \\"Prepare For Salvation\\" which I really like. It just gets me pumped up everytime I hear it. Track four \\"Securitron (Police State 2000)\\" is another awesome pummeling cut that features an amazing melodic sung chorus, and I also love the ending, while the following track \\"Descent\\" which is my favorite song on here, is an awesome and catchy melodic cut that features awesome melodic clean singing from Burton along with a great drum beat, and nice melodic riffage. Next up, \\"Hi-Tech Hate\\" turns up the voltage once again, and has another awesome chorus, and all around amazing drumming from Raymond, and the following two tracks \\"Freedom or Fire\\" and \\"Obsolete\\" both continue to bring the brutal aggression, while track nine \\"Resurrection\\" is another amazing melodic cut and an epic one at that which begins with some beautiful sounding keyboards and Burton's melodic vocals before the rest of the band joins in, and of course \\"Timelessness\\" is highlighted by an all around phenominal melodic vocal performance by Burton, and it's also in my opinion, one of his best vocal performances ever. I've always been a sucker for melodic vocals, and Burton has got one of the best clean vocals not only in metal, but in all music period. We're also treated with five bonus tracks including a cover of Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\", and a cover of Wiseblood's \\"0-0 (WhereEvil Dwells)\\", as well as \\"Soulwound\\", \\"Messiah\\", and \\"Concreto\\".<br /><br />All in all, \\"Obsolete\\" is an all around epic and intense all killer, no filler industrial/metal classic that is an absolute must have for any fan of Fear Factory, industrial, and metal alike. I'd definately recommend the digi pack version with the five bonus tracks which I proudly own. Trust me friends, you won't be disappointed. Fear Factory Rules... SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM!!as well as \\"Soulwound\\", \\"Messiah\\", and \\"Concreto\\".     All in all, \\"Obsolete\\" is an all around epic and intense all killer, no filler industrial/metal classic that is an absolute must have for any fan of Fear Factory, industrial, and metal alike.

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I have already written a review on the original release of `Watchmen' on DVD. However, for you first time readers I have posted the original review of the movie along with my review of the Ultimate collection.<br /><br />The comic book has now officially become the mainstream in the world of film. The major companies try to get their hands on every franchise they possibly can. The real question is once there is a movie in play how will translate to the big screen and who is the fan base? Well, we all have seen what `The Dark Knight' and `Spider-Man' have done. Still, what about the no so main stream novels such as `300'? There are directors out there that don't want to make a movie in their own vision, but yet they wish to bring the book to the screen word for word, page for page. That is the film 'Watchmen'.<br /><br />'Watchmen' may be the biggest cult fan based comic book of all time. Written in an alternate reality in the 1980s, the Cold War is very much alive and all of Earth is extremely concerned about nuclear war. The heroes in this world are not ones special abilities or powers, and they are not liked by the people. Though, the costumed crusaders prevail to keep the people in line and keep order in the world. Suddenly one of them is brutally murdered and they are now the ones who fear extinction.<br /><br />I made it my business to make sure I read the graphic novel before I went to see this film and it was a wise choice. This movie no doubt tried to remain as faithful to the comic as possible. The dialogue was melancholy, they characters were well cast and while there were not as many effects as a major comic book blockbuster it was still put together in a very artsy package. Though, this movie is truly not for the mainstream movie goers. Watchmen was definitely created with the true comic book fan in mind. The director Zack Snyder like on his previous work with `300' wanted to make a movie that was just as authentic as the pages it was first concocted upon. Those who read this story would definitely enjoy it even though it is a very slow movie dragged out story. There are a few major things that are changed for cinematic purposes, but after reading this story I believe that the changes made really made the story more believable and less confusing. The changing of the costumes was a positive thing because some of those characters really looked like pimped out hood ornaments in print. The actors chosen were not well known which a great thing is always. They each filled their roles perfectly and it really made me feel like the comic book was actually coming to life before my eyes. I believe that if you read the book definitely pick the movie up. If you are an innovative person who wants to see something different then you might enjoy it as well. But, I think if you are looking for the typical action super-hero flick let this one pass you by, you might not understand it. Alan Moore may have officially removed himself from any film that his work was to become, but I believe he needs to see this one, because it really has done him justice. Watchmen came out at the right time because Zack Snyder got it right.<br /><br />Apparently I was not on target when I originally wrote my review, because now we have a 5 DVD Watchmen extravaganza. I have to say for one movie on its' own I have never seen such a package. This edition has everything that was made in honor of this film even dating before the movie itself was officially released in theaters! Before the movie came out where two animated films made for DVD release. The animated creation of `Tales of The Black Freighter', which is an essential piece to the Watchmen story. The special feature on that DVD included `Tales From Under the Hood'. In the graphic novel itself you see excerpts of that book and for DVD it is reinvented to be a television documentary complete with effects that make it look aged and its own advertisements. The other DVD release was `Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic'. This was the graphic novel page for page narrated like a book on tape making the original comic book art look as if it was jumping right off the page. Thanks to this new Ultimate collectors edition these two projects are woven in to the film to make it more true to the novel and really give this film the honor and respect it deserves. Other features include the official video journals and incredible documentaries and commentary not to mention a digital copy of the original theatrical release. How can you possibly pass up purchasing this amazing DVD package? This package has it all...I am serious there is nothing missing from this film now! If you loved this movie you are going to love it even more when you officially have the complete story.as the graphic novel page for page narrated like a book on tape making the original comic book art look as if it was jumping right off the page.

B002MBAJ4M|5.0|Before I started to write this review, I briefly looked over some of the things that have been said in some of the recent reviews to try to provide myself a sense of perspective. Like a number of the reviewers that I read, when I first listened to Gov't Mule's new CD I felt a little underwhelmed but that sense went away pretty quickly for me... a little more and a little faster with each listening of the CD.       Like almost every CD that you could possibly name (with a few notable exceptions), I think that this one has its strong moments and its weak moments but as I sit here trying to decide what I will tell you I believe the strongest moments are, I find myself at a loss to really put them into that kind of order. I mean, is the funky addictive rhythm of \\"Broke Down on the Brazos\\" stronger than the catchy riffs of \\"Stepping Lightly\\" or \\"Any Open Window\\"? Is the wonderful traditional sound of \\"Railroad Boy\\" stronger than the tongue-in-cheek lyrical fun of \\"Inside Outside Woman Blues #3\\"? Those are hard, hard questions for me to answer.       And even what I consider to be \\"weak moments\\" -- \\"Monday Mourning Meltdown\\" and \\"World Wake Up\\" primarily -- have elements or moments in them that make them worth listening to at least once. But that is only two tracks out of eleven that I consider \\"weak\\" and by anyone's accounting, that is not bad at all.       The Mule's sound is a little different in this CD than in previous efforts but not only do I consider that to be a good thing, I am out of my seat giving the band a standing ovation. I mean, think about it: do you want every CD from a band that you really love to sound like every CD that they have ever done? No. And the reason that you don't want that (at least the reason that _I_ don't) is because differences in sound and style mean that that band is growing and finding new ways to express themselves. And THAT means that there are hopefully many more new CDs in that band's future.       So to you Mule fans who haven't listened to By A Thread yet and to those of you who gave up on it after a listen or two: give it a chance and I think you will really like what is happening in it.       To the guys in the band itself: thanks for making another wonderful and inspiring CD. Keep making 'em. We're still listeing.

The album contains so many gems that it is hard to pick out some that stand out. \\"Boheamian Rhapsody\\", \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\" and \\"We Will Rock You\\" are truly amazing tracks. The booklet contains no lyrics and not a list of whom plays what. The album was met with positive reviews and Allmusic and Sputnickmusic both gave the album high marks. The album was a massive hit around the world and was number one in several countries, e.g., Australia, Canada and Austria to mention a few. 5/5.

B000F8DB4O|5.0|There are things about this album that take your breath away.  To begin having been a Metheny fan for about a decade this was \\"just another good album.\\"  Cool, great sounding, a departure but just great sounding, but then I listened to \\"To The End Of The World\\" and was knocked on my butt!  I can't put into words how I felt.    It gets better.  My one year old son was very hyper and it was hard to get him to settle down.  One day I was sorting clothes for the laundry and decided to listen to We Live Here to pass the time.  Here to Stay comes on and my son freezes.  He's focused on the speakers now.  By the time he \\"To The End..\\" is finished he's sleep!  From that point on he wouldn't go to bed without me turning on We Live Here in his room.  It was his music.      Then I bought the DVD of the Japan concert from the same album.  He and my infant daughter went through two copies of it!    I could go on about the inspirational stories from this album.  There's something about this album (esp. \\"To The End...\\") that magnetically draws people to it like addicts.  Once I play \\"To The End...\\" they're hooked.    You owe it to yourself to give it a try.  Buy it used for a couple of bucks if you have to.  You'll feel like you really hit the jackpot.

0307716988|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it is written by Micheal Jackson himself and a ghost writer. The little slices of life that he shared in this book from his earlier days are very touching. It gave a rare insight into the struggle and victory that became his life. The time he spent on tour with his brother's whom he clearly loved so dearly, gave me a sense of his warmth as an individual. That is something I will treasure always along with his music. If you are an avid Micheal Jackson fan I highly recommend this book becuase it give great insight into his genuis and his humanity and his legacy. Quite simply put all that is and ever will be the King of Pop, Moonwalker,Gloved one,Thiller,the Legendary Micheal Jackson.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This Paramore album has a much different feel than their last album Riot. All of these songs have lyrics that appear to be much deeper than those songs on Riot. There is also a slight change in style, some people may not like this, but I like the fact that these songs seem  more meaningful than those on Riot. Riot was a ton of fun to listen to and I loved it as an album, but I really like what Paramore is bringing to the table with Brand New Eyes.
B002ISID10|5.0|This album is amazing. It encompasses all forms of music that have come around in the last twenty years with the exception of country and rap. The lyrics are thought provoking and interesting as you slowly figure what they are actually saying. They utilize several different vocal styles from deep growls remeniscent of early 90s death metal to gutteral growls similar to the early days of Carcass. They also utilize some screams and clean vocals, some acompany music that reminds one of all the boy bands that appeared in the 90s. These sections are brief and add to the overall texture of the music. Every style they utilize has been done before, however, the mix is phenomenal. It creates a landscape of sound that is at one moment visceral and the next serene. The album as a whole has a flow to it as well. This is a rare album that has 13 singles but at the same time, is more complete as a whole. Since I found this album, i have not stopped listening to it (about four weeks now). Even my wife enjoyed it and her usual is onerepublic and bucky covington. This music spans so much without being pigeonholed into any one genre. Buy this album and you will not be dissappointed. easily the best of 09!!!
B002V0WN2K|1.0|I've been a Bon Jovi fan since before they were big. I remember picking up Runaway long before it was a hit.  I've seen them live three times - all back in the day.  Sadly, \\"The Cirlce \\" is not Bon Jovi.  I'm not sure if they've forgotten how to rock or if they're stuck in between wanting to play country or rock, but this new CD is sorely disappointing, even at a mere $4.  There's no grit, no hard rocking licks... it's way too slick and overproduced. Set up and rock out. Don't let your producer shave off all the grit! You're from Jersey!!! Jon, brotha... your voice is starting to sound way too much like Neil Diamond.  Epic failure this outing boys.
0316017922|3.0|We know success is a function of intelligence, inspiration, hard-work, perspiration, and finally the luck or chance or things falling in place. The book emphasizes on things working right for intelligent and hard working people. It stresses less on how and why people are motivated. There is also one other element to consider. Although things fall in place, it is up to the person to take advantage of the opportunity. In a way, the book might me stating the obvious. For example, only a fraction of people make the finish line running a marathon. The book talks about that few who made it. If they made it, that means they are fit, had enough practice, and had the mental push. It's the basic theory of probability. The book looses focus towards the last few chapters. Overall, it's a good read.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Everyone in my family loved this movie! It is perfect for fantasy lovers of mostly all ages. I would be careful not to share this with younger kids wihout explaining that the special effects make some of the characters and some parts of the story look scary.<br />The story of Tristan escaping his walled city in search of his mother is so enchanting. It is humorous without being too goofy, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Robert De Niro as a pirate!
B001FB55H6|5.0|I had never heard of the Watchmen before seeing the movie, so I have no preconceptions on that front. I did read comic books as a kid.<br /><br />One warning prospective viewers should be aware of: there is intense graphic violence in this movie, along with some male frontal nudity. This is NOT your standard superhero movie suitable for children, this is a movie for adults.<br /><br />I loved this movie. For me it is completely unique, I can't even compare it to any other movie I've seen. A unique style, a unique story, I found it confusing but fascinating to watch. It sticks in your head. I'm going to have to watch it again just so I can pick up a more of what I missed the first time around. I guess for a general description of the movie it is a highly stylized, morally ambivalent version of the \\"what if super heroes were real?\\" premise, mixed with some retro and detective storytelling. But that doesn't do it justice - this is a fantastic movie experience. It's funny, dramatic, violent, and it has all kinds of intrigue and fascinating characters.<br /><br />Frankly, the lead (Rorshack) should have been nominated for an oscar. He was great. Best Line Ever comes when he is sent to prison and must deal with all the people he sent there who want their revenge and think they have him right where they want him: \\"You don't understand... I'm not locked in here with YOU... you're locked in here with ME.\\"<br /><br />This movie should go down in history as a true classic on the level of Blade Runner.
0385504225|2.0|The Davinci Code is one of my top five books of all time. I preordered the Lost Symbol from Amazon the day it was available. When it came out I was too busy with work to give it proper attention so waited until I had some uninterrupted time on a plane ride back and forth to the East Coast. I got through the first 100 pages and if it wasn't a Dan Brown book would have stopped there...somewhere around 150 it actually picked up and got good for a while but as many have said there is so much unnecessary description in the book I wound up skimming through about two hundred pages only to get to the end and what did I get? A huge waste of my time. Angels and Demons and Davinci were great...this book was so bad on the whole and the ending was so atrocious it's almost as if someone else wrote it. If you must read it try and borrow it from someone...don't waste good money on it.
B001641ZZS|4.0|In these days of digital remastering of older releases- where the remastered sound often suffers over the top digital brick wall compression (the \\"loudness war\\"), its great to find a modern remaster sounding genuinely better & clearer than the original.  The only other recent remasters I know of where this is true is of the new Beatles 2009 ones.  The difference is that this is alternative rock/ pop genre and also its one of the only bands where the increased sonic clarity and punch is thanks to the fantastic job the sound engineers have done from the original tapes and the SACD release format.  Its a shame no other alternative bands (other than NIN) have been blessed with this process... but here's hoping for Rage Against The Machine, Nirvana, and Midnight Oil (not that these original CD releases sound bad).  The loudness war makes me sick to the point I almost have to take my laptop into my record store to see how overly compressed and ruined many modern releases are before I decide whether I'll hand over any money for them (no wonder CD sales are rapidly declining).  However with alternative rock on SACD I know I'll always get the best possible sound hands down!  The Pixies were a great band, and Doolittle a brilliant album that still sounds fresh as ever.  Turn it up on your SACD player and relive it as never before!  My only gripe is the packaging- a cardboard digipack type thingy with the disc in a miniture felt sleeve- I suppose some artist thought this would be classy but its a pain in the ass.  Its also oddly oversize so it doesn't fit at all with my other CDs- I had to cut it down to fit in a standard Jewel case.  Looking forward to Surfa Rosa next.
1401922732|4.0|A very strong deck, forceful archangel Michael energy VERY strong indeed! It is a no-nonsense, to-the-point kind of deck. It is art wise also very beautiful and old fashioned. This deck works well for pulling \\"random\\" cards, but I feel it is even better in more elaborate spreads. The only thing I personally would see different, is some clues of the cards meaning on them in stead of suggested prayers. But after familiarizing one self with the cards and the strong, pure energy in them, this might be the intuitive way to work them. A good strong tool by all means!
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I don't enjoy many Woody Allen movies, mainly because I find the man himself to be highly annoying as an actor. I didn't expect to like this movie much, but it engaged me and by the time it was over I realized that I had really enjoyed it. It stuck in my head for awhile as a bit of an experience. I didn't even mind the strange narration. It's hard to pin down exactly what I liked about it, but the acting was good, Penelope Cruz was fun to watch, the dialogue was interesting, and I just enjoyed absorbing the whole thing. Partly it was the (to me) somewhat exotic setting I suppose. I'd guess that this type of movie is not for everyone, but I found it very enjoyable.
B002DESIE6|1.0|Well well well...another typical hype. Recently I was discussing this record with a friend and he said: the reviews are simply too great again, tehre must be something wrong. And there is something wrong: the record. Do not get me wrong, I was ready to be positive but this was completely underwhelming by any standard. Lack of consistent melodies and songwriting. Dull ambiance overall. The packaging is neat however but it really should be about the music and here it obviously is not...Avoid. If I could I would have given this a 0.

B002K0WBXW|2.0|If you enjoy romantic comedies, you'll probably like this movie. I did. Sandra Bullock is as charming as ever, Ryan Reynolds is bitingly funny, the supporting cast is very good, and the movie itself has enough funny moments to be worthwhile. The downside is that it is extremely formulaic and predictable. You will know what to expect from this movie from the very beginning, with every cliche played out in full. I think the cast saves the movie, they are funny enough to make it work.

0321544080|5.0|This has to be one of my all-time favorite photography books. It is packed with interesting scenarios and solutions to lighting portraits in various (some quirky) conditions.  Joe's style is humorous and insightful and the information is presented in small chunks, appropriate for reading in small doses or taking in all at once.    I have owned it for over one year and pick it up again and again to re-read various sections when I need some inspiration.    So you know: this is NOT a how-to recipe book that baby talks you through how to use gear (if you want that, buy the very disappointing follow up: Hotshoe Diaries); Joe speaks from a conceptual standpoint and sets no hard rules (except: never shoot locker room without a strobe!).    Highly recommended!!

0061719544|5.0|Want to read about a real person who allows himself to reveal his pores and flaws? \\"American on Purpose\\" is an easy read with all the humor and spontaneity one has come to expect from the impromptu Late Late Show host. Here's a fellow that dismantles the 'foreigner syndrome', helps us get past our misperceptions, and forces us to encounter our cultural tendencies toward histrionics. Deftly written by the hand of a fellow traveler that is not afraid of the bumps in the road.     Buy his book - support his art; he's witty, quirky, fun, and therapy for a world that thinks too much of itself.
B001T30232|4.0|I found it hard to put down this deeply engaging novel. Denny and his dog Enzo are marvelous male characters, and I really appreciate that Denny's 2 best friends are an appealing gay couple.  At several points, however, I wished for some more authentic feminine perspective.<br /><br />Oh there are some female characters.  I was grateful for the moving scenes between Enzo and Denny's wife Eve.  But we don't get to know Eve well, and then she dies. Their daughter is drawn well, but Zoe and her mother are mostly absent during the second half of the book. Worst of all, a fifteen-year old vixen causes poor innocent Denny to almost lose his daughter, his reputation, and his career. Perhaps a manipulative seductress is necessary for the plot, but did Stein have to write such a misogynist clich&eacute;?<br /><br />I love Enzo's voice.  I love the glimpse into the world of racing, a sport I've never understood before this book. I love the surprise ending of this beautiful affirmation of reincarantion and of the courageous human--and canine--spirit.<br /><br />Nancy Manahan, co-author of [[ASIN:1592981798 Living Consciously, Dying Gracefully - A Journey with Cancer and Beyond]][...]

B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Sadly I missed this film in theaters. I didn't think my 4 year old son would sit though the movie, despite the fact that Pixar never disappoints. Plus I am a sucker for the whole 3D thing, and these CGI animated features usually look amazing.<br /><br />Needless to say, one of the main reasons I decided to purchase a blu-ray player a month ago was to see this movie in excellent quality in my home.<br /><br />I sat down the night it came out with the entire family, including my son. We loved it. The 4 year old watched the entire thing and really enjoyed it. I have loved everything Pixar has done and after they made a really great movie about a rat that can cook, I decided I would never ever doubt Pixar's storytelling power again.<br /><br />Visually the blu-ray is amazing, the sound is excellent. But of course what really shines is the touching story of an old man that was never able to re-visit the vacation spot that he and his wife have always wanted to visit. Pixar has an amazing ability to make mature stories that adults can enjoy and relate to, but tell them in such a way that kids enjoy them as well.<br /><br />On the surface a \\"kids\\" movie that centers on a senior citizen is not a kid's cup of tea so to speak. But the characters are so well developed, better than most live action movies by the way. If you missed this movie in the theater, I would add it to your collection immediately. It's my first Disney Blu-Ray and it was well worth it!
0061780308|5.0|This review is for the CD of the book read by Christopher Evan Welch.  I grabbed this, along with two other \\"talking books\\" for my long commute.  First I read the John Updike, Seek My Face because I love the topic--20th C. American art.  It was dreary and disappointing.  Then I listened to Sue Monk Kidd's The Mermaid Chair because I had loved her Secret Life of Bees.  This was a lot better than the Updike book but nowhere up to \\"Bees.\\"  The last was this...and I think it was sheer luck that made me choose it because I'm not a big dog lover, I have absolutely no interest in auto racing and I'd never heard of Garth Stein.    Maybe it was the great picture on the cover.  After reading the blurb, something about the story told through a dog's eyes, I decided to return it to the library without listening.  It sounded overly cute.  On the drive to the library, though, I stuck disk one in the CD player and after only a few minutes I was hooked!  Maybe it was the terrific reading by Welch...very deadpan...reminded me of Sgt. Joe Friday on \\"Dragnet\\" but with enough intonation to keep it interesting.  I kept thinking that it would be very hard to find the right voice to read this...and Welch did a superb job.  I haven't read the text but I can't imagine that it would be any better than this audio version.    As for the story, it is so funny, so \\"human\\" (for a dog), so heartfelt and yet wise, I can't recommend it highly enough.  Garth Stein avoids a lot of pitfalls in this technique; it could have been terribly maudlin but he walked the line between  pathos and hilarity perfectly.  Enzo, our hero, is getting ready to reincarnate as a human, he hopes and so he observes his hero, Denny, the race driver scrupulously, so that he can be a wonderful \\"man.\\"  When Welch pronounces \\"man\\" he gives it such feeling that you really get what high expectations Enzo has for becoming one.  It's quite moving.    There's a lot of metaphysics tucked in in ways that are wise and non-objectionable.I found myself writing down some of Enzo's better sayings.      Mostly I loved how Stein didn't shrink from the heights and depths of emotion.  He didn't play cool or give it a wimpy, non-satisfying   New Yorker kind of ending that, unfortunately passes for good writing these days.  He played it full-out, just like Enzo and Denny would have wanted.  I absolutely loved the ending!      'Sure am glad I listened to this CD.

B00006JLX4|1.0|I still do not understand or comprehend why this band continually gets so much praise and adoration from people (granted getting a 10/10 review from elitist blowhards like Pitchfork doesn't mean a whole lot). The band's songs lack vitality and they sound like a band that was woken up at 5 am to sing and play songs they didn't want to write and definitely didn't want to perform. It sounds lifeless and that they could give a crap. Before I get a a lot of poser indie kids jumping on my back I would like to point out that I am a huge fan of independent rock music. Whether it be brilliant bands such as Built To Spill, Brainiac, Camper Van Beethoven and love pretty everything that comes out of labels like Dischord (FUGAZI, Jawbox, Dag Nasty ) SST (Husker Du, MInutemen, Black Flag). Furthermore, I love other genres of music from Metal, Salsa, Soul, Funk, Avant Garde, Classical, Hip Hop, Ambient, Drum and Bass etc and and the common thread with much of the music that I respond to whether it be A Tribe Called Quest, Crowded House, Earth or Fennesz is that their records and their music are indicative of a collective (band) or an individual that sounds like they give a crap when they play their music. You can hear passion and vitality in their music. Unfortunately this band does not belong to that esteemed group of musicians and frankly never will. If you want to hear people that really sound vital and you want to hear passion in your music rather than a bunch of out of tune whiny vocals and lifeless musicianship I suggest you pick a Neurosis record (The Eye of Every Storm) a Fennesz record (Venice) or Sly and the Family Stone (Stand) because that is music played my people who have a pulse and heart beating inside of them.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|To be brief;  Were all recordings made of the  questionable quality enhanced here?  Like Lennon's \\"Primal\\" the inadequacies of the time were obscured by the emotional nature of the offerings.  Springstein at Hammersmith is an excellent example of artists whose recordings literally encapselled the moment.  You could almost smell the leaves outdoors in the park on that particular \\"frozen?\\" moment in time.  Enhancement of the 'beatles \\"white album\\" leaves us with the question; What was the flavor of the time that compelled us to swallow whole large tracts of post-psychedelic euphoria?
0307387151|5.0|I usually make a point of not seeing a movie before I get a chance to read the book, but the opposite is true for my experience with McEwan's Atonement. I rented the movie last summer from Netflix and as soon as the movie ended, I stared at the blank screen for a moment, blinked a couple of times in wonderment, and then hit play and watched it in its entirety a second time. Needless to say, I was completely entranced with the storyline and the cinematography. All of this is to say that after having such a wonderful experience with the movie adaptation, I began to worry that I'd ruined the possibility of having a good reading experience with the novel. I find it difficult to read a book after I've seen the movie since I have so many preconceived notions of the characters' appearance and eccentricities locked into my head visually.<br /><br />Never fear. I loved the book just as much as the movie. I actually listened to this book, mostly while driving, and I'm quite lucky I didn't wind up in a ditch somewhere due to my complete inattention to my surroundings. I became so wrapped up in the characters, the story, and the heart wrenching consequences of one thirteen-year-old's misinterpretation of a number of events and a rash decision. This was my first foray into Ian McEwan's writing and it definitely won't be the last. I was mesmerized with his writing style. The characters, especially that of the young Briony, were so well-drawn.  She is so frustratingly self-absorbed and narcissistic in the beginning of the novel, and her imaginative whims that so many young girls possess lead to such a catastrophic turn of events. I'll say no more. You must read it for yourself.<br /><br />I don't often reread books anymore due to the sheer quantity of amazing novels out there that I must get my hands on, but I can definitely say this is a book I will revisit, perhaps a few times, in the future.
0380715430|5.0|It has been said that English and American are two cultures divided by a common language. Here Bill Bryson, an American, gets to grips with that common language which through its extraordinary flexibility and the even more extraordinary willingness to welcome and absorb words and phrases from any of the world's five thousand-odd languages and dialects, has become the lingua franca of business, science and technology, and communication. Any past predictions that the English spoken in the two countries will gradually diverge into two mutually incomprehensible tongues has well and truly been laid to rest with the advent of the Internet since Bryson's book was first published. Despite 4000 different words in general usage it is very unlikely that serious confusion or misunderstanding would arise in an exchange between somebody from Birmingham, West Midlands or Birmingham, Alabama. Of course, the differences between American and British English is not the principal subject discussed in this fast-paced, humorous homage to the most expansive of the world's languages, though in some ways it is one of the most important, given the prominent role of the United States in shaping world economy and culture. Bryson is particularly strong on debunking the myths surrounding so-called Americanisms and the vitriol directed towards American English by British commentators and statesmen over the years. In fact, most terms were in usage in the mother country in the past, had died out there, and then were reintroduced in recent times from America to where they had previously been carried by British immigrants (Shakespeare, for example, used `trash', a word today associated uniquely with America).<br />Mother Tongue begins with a brief overview of the world's languages and is followed by a (scientifically dated) chapter on how and when language arose in humans and by what means it spread across the globe. We then learn how English morphed from an obscure peasant's language spoken on an obscure island 1500 years ago to become a linguistic superpower. There follow chapters on the varieties of English, how it came to be (loosely) standardised, the English-American schism, English as a world language, and on spelling, names, swearing and word play. English is, of course, spoken, pronounced and spelt in a multitude of forms. These variations are tailor-made for Bryson's familiar method of subjecting the reader to a dazzling bombardment of curious and often hilarious facts, anecdotes and rumours, some well-documented, some dubious and some plainly apocryphal. This is the style of the book throughout. Mother Tongue does not claim to be a work of scholarship but is a populist account based on extensive research and delivered with schoolboyish enthusiasm. It is pitched at a level that makes a complicated and sometimes abstruse subject available to all. This to me is the purpose of populist works: to introduce people to a subject and to encourage them to develop their fascination further. It is then that they move on to study more academic works. Mother Tongue fulfils the same role for English language and linguistics that Bryson's own A Short History of Nearly Everything does for science. Both books are highly recommended introductory texts.e island 1500 years ago to become a linguistic superpower.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|As an avid Trek fan- who used to tape the show audio on a little reel to reel and no one was allowed to call during Star Trek - I am shocked to see such narrow mindedness from people who were on the fringe for so long. I have pretty much stuck with the Trek franchise (Tho I truly hated the one with Captain Janeway...can't recall the name of the series) Next Gen was fun from the get go, and DS9 grew on me. Enterprise was an overlooked gem imo. So walking into the theater I was a little hesitant. That quickly dissolved after the brilliant first 10 minutes of the film. Is it the same show I grew up with? No. Of course not. But does it capture the same energy and spirit- I think so. Lest we forget in our advancing age- Trek WAS an adventure show that was sometimes just about the ADVENTURE. It was not always pointy headed \\"thinking\\" all the time. That's what made it a great show- a little something for everyone. The other thing that made it click was a great cast, and this movie also brings together a great cast who appear to be able to handle whatever is thrown at them. For those who say it's not the old Trek- feel fortunate to have three seasons of that to watch anytime you like. For me - I'll enjoy this just as well!
B000055ZB8|5.0|There are really no words to explain how marvelous this film really is.<br /><br />But, you need words to create a review, so I must try.<br /><br />There are a few reasons to completely admire and respect this film.  The first, and most obvious, is that the film is impeccably made, especially when you consider the date on the back of the DVD.  Beings that this film was made in 1922, it is rather remarkable that it holds up today, but hold up it does.  A solid mixture of intense use of shadows (who doesn't remember with sheer terror the image of a shadowy figure ascending the staircase) as well as stop motion editing (that spectacular coffin loading scene is just chilling) come together to create a breathtaking cinematic experience that exceeds in almost every area.<br /><br />Next to the actual camerawork you have some marvelous directorial choices that elevate the films mood and tone, and then there is the performances from the entire cast that just take this film to another level all together.<br /><br />Max Schreck is the king of all the vampires, for his Graf Orlok is a devastatingly infectious blend of human suffering and pure evil.  While the film itself doesn't aggressively explore the more human side to this monster, Schreck's deliberate manipulation of character helps create someone three-dimensional.  Gustav von Wangerheim is essential to the films growth, especially in the beginning.  His theatrical delivery makes for a quirky and engrossing character.  Greta Schroder takes reins in the films end and completely devours her screen time, giving us a woman who knows her destiny and is willing to embrace it.  I also found Alexander Granach's humorous take on Orlok's devoted follower Knock to be delightful.<br /><br />These are all obvious reasons to love the film, but the biggest reason is that the film itself is just really, really good.<br /><br />The tale of Nosferatu is one of chills, thrills and perverse romance, and it is delivered spectacularly here.  `Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens' is the essential vampire film, for it captures all aspects of this twisted tale; the mood, emotional connection and delicious terror.  The final frames may have the edge as far as imminent horror, but the entire film carries a beautiful spookiness that cannot be matched by films today.  With crisp sepia tones and startling use of fisheye lenses and sharp angles, `Nosferatu' is an outstanding film that lives up to all expectations and puts most horror films of today to shame.e essential vampire film, for it captures all aspects of this twisted tale; the mood, emotional connection and delicious terror.

B002LE6XR2|5.0|I guess I was lucky since the lamp I received was not broken. It came in one piece and is attached to the base. The lamp runs on 4 AA batteries. The bluray cases stand up and fit into grooves in the plastic black base. There is an adjustable piece that holds up the first cases until you fill up all the spaces.  This doesn't seem to be the most durable lamp (plastic) so you would want to be very careful with this lamp because it will not be replaceable since Disney/Pixar settled the lawsuit with Luxo and will not be selling anymore. This might be better for adults b/c if kids play with it, it would probably get broken. The movie is great of course and is a must see. More sad and emotional than the usual Disney/Pixar movie. Not just a movie for kids.

She may seem intimidating, super-woman-like, when you watch her doing her routine for the first time. I personally thought she was crazy and wondered what her baby looked like when she delivered. But when I actually did the video, I was pleasantly surprised that she gave me just the right amount of exercise and energy I needed. I've been doing this routine since the first trimester. I'm 30 weeks along and not going to stop. I feel great and in a good shape. Don't be scared by the negative reviews.
B0011Z32KI|2.0|This is my first Michael Bulé album. This guy has a great voice, but the arrangements and his phrasing are all plain vanilla and boring, in my opinion. This is the kind of music a middle-aged White woman who goes to the Meyerson hall in Dallas likes. I put this in the same category as Michael Bolton or Kenny G.    In my opinion, it's all very formula, very predictable, and has no soul.    This is the kind of act I'd expect at Disney World or a cruise ship.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|an entertaining idea of casting WWII as a western; throwing in a little \\"DIRTY DOZEN\\" in the mix.  \\"INGLORIOUS BASTERDS\\" was the 2nd best film of '09; \\"DISTRICT 9\\" BEING #1.    all hail TARANTINO!  now, if one could only stop ron howard from making any more movies.
0525950079|5.0|Great book and follow-on to \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", though not necessary to read, but does lend depth to this storey.  Great characters, some strong and kind, others strong and malevolent and others conniving all in a vivid picture 200 years after \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\".  Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed reading to each other...
B002K0WBY6|5.0|The best comedy movie I have seen in a long time.  I would reccomend this movie to any one who likes romantic comedies.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Had been looking forward to this release for a while. Saw The Killers during there last tour and have been a fan since there first studio album. The experience on this Blu Ray is as close you can get without actually buying tickets to see them. The sound quality and picture are great. The Set list is amazing and there performance can't be better. A must have for all victims!
B002V0WN2K|3.0|Ok, I've listen their work for more than 15 years...and finally I've found their blue print. Many songs remind me of old (good) ones. The song about love, the song about hang to life, the one kinda of revolutionary, the one with long solo guitar...etc, etc. If you know them, you'll enjoy like any other album, but expect NO big surprises, they are careful to use their blue print and record one more album. The price? might compensate the ridiculous high concert ticket prices.
B00005N83M|4.0|Strange as it may sound this was always an album that interested me. Turn of the millenium pop music was something I was ignoring at the time because my musical interest of the time was pretty heavy jazz-funk. At this point Jennifer Lopez's musical concept seemed pretty interesting to me:that mix of modern latin dance-pop music with some references to contemporary R&B and actually a healthy helping of funk. Because of all her drama was P-Diddy and the whole press blitz that surrounded her at the time though I can see how her presense might've seemed clished and annoying. But as I often say you really can't get the singer confused with the song. It's a similar issue I faced in the past with Michael Jackson. But when I actually got a chance to listen to this album I found it not only an entertaining musical experience but one that was musically pretty potent as well. True to be said there are some songs here that are merely radio fodder for the day and,I have to say I have to put the big hit \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing As Among Them\\". That and songs such as \\"Walking On Sunshine\\",\\"We Gotta Talk\\",\\"That's Not Me\\",\\"I'm Gonna Be Alright\\" and \\"That's The Way\\" are all kind of music-of-the-moment type tunes that probably sound great the first time but in the end don't leave any huge impression beyond their time. \\"Play\\" on the other hand is a hit that's also an amazing song! It's got this strong dance-funk groove with this Jam & Lewis/Prince style Minneapolis flavor and actually jams pretty hard for something so oriented around programming proving that,if you want to modern funk-pop doesn't have to be natural to be good. \\"I'm Real\\" has a somewhat more modern approch to a similar tune with a loop built around the Yellow Magic Orchestra. \\"Secretely\\" is one of the slower tunes on the album but the hook to the song,the reverbed pulse and Jen's multi tracked vocal harmonies give it a genuinely sexy flavor. One of the great things about this is how latin oriented much of the material is,much of it written and co-written by Jen herself.\\"Carino\\" and \\"Dame\\" are sung in Spanish and the pop-salsa flavor of the song with their hot n heavy horns seem kind of a dry run for some of the music surrounding her in her role in the excellent Richard Gear film [[ASIN:B0006GAI6Y Shall We Dance? (Widescreen Edition)]]. \\"Ain't It Funny\\",\\"Dance With Me\\" and \\"Si Ya S Acabo'\\" are in English but capture that same flavor very strongly,kind of picking up where Gloria Estefan had gone before her. It might be all too easy to dismiss this album as nothing but pure pop fluff based soley on the impressions of the artist involved. But fact is this is a very potent album that,once you listen to it isn't perfect but has more than a handful of excellent songs and grooves to offer.much of the material is,much of it written and co-written by Jen herself.\\"Carino\\" and \\"Dame\\" are sung in Spanish and the pop-salsa flavor of the song with their hot n heavy horns seem kind of a dry run for some of the music surrounding her in her role in the excellent Richard Gear film [[ASIN:B0006GAI6Y Shall We Dance?

We love it for rainy days at home!

1594202249|1.0|This was my first Pynchon read and it probably gonna be my last.  As a Scandinavian I try to keep up with American literature and pick out half a dozen US books every year. I heard much positive things about Pynchon so my expectations were high. I also lived in Southern California for a year so I was thrilled to read a story that takes place in LA. But the book was a big disappointment. It is a bad detective story (read Stieg Larsson instead) and the writer's comments about American society are without any depth (read Philip Roth instead). I think this is not meant to be a book; Pynchon wants this to be a film. Every chapter (or sometimes part of chapter) will be a great scene. But a book not written to be a book will fail, and this one does fail - big time.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Like many of the people disappointed with the movie, I'm a long time fan of Star Trek. This movie was just terrible. The 'alternate' timeline was an excuse to make what can only be described as bad fanfiction. The movie is all mindless sparkles and explosions with none of the intelligence of the series. Also, you can plainly see that Abrams was a Star Wars fan rather than a Star Trek fan when you watch the movie. I think it's very sad that this is the new 'face' of Star Trek.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|Well, it took me three times to make my way through Disney's Blu-Ray version of Snow White; let's just say there was more than one person named \\"Sleepy\\". It's not the most gripping of movies. But it is a masterpiece and a break-though film for the Walt Disney company.    As with most movie reviews I do, I will speak to the quality of the transfer, and not the film itself. Plenty of others will have covered that ground, and besides, I think its box office track record speaks for itself.    Video: B: The majority of the film is clean and pristine. However, some scenes appear blurred or out of focus. Also, I was surprised when I noticed that Snow White's face and arm in a frame had blue pixilation's, as if the computer processing had not really been complete. I had not seen this same effect in Pinocchio or Sleeping Beauty. Do I have a defective disc?    Audio: C: Frankly, the audio was extremely flat. Mixed in 7.1? You could get away with using only a center channel 95 percent of the time. And the sub was lightly used. Let down.    Assuming my disc is not defective (and I don't think it is), it is apparent to me that this Disney classic was on cruise control with the computer restoration, and very little effort has gone into ensuring the computer restoration was utterly complete. I'll be guarded in my hoped for future releases (like Dumbo). Still, I have these films only on VHS (I skipped DVD), so Blu-Ray is an obvious step up in quality.     Extras: A+: Usually I am not concerned in extras. I'll watch it, but its not part of the grading criteria. In this case, however, I am inclined to comment and include it in the overall grade. The second disc, one that is primarily dominated by the History of Hyperion Studios, is AMAZING. More work went into producing this masterpiece than with the actual accompanying movie feature. For any serious Disney fan, this is a MUST OWN. It features hours of incredibly detailed information on the birth of the Disney company, with stunningeffects and audio/video clips.
B002NXSRW0|2.0|Why did Snake Eyes' face mask have lips? Just one of many atrocities commited by this film.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I've always heard of Kings of Leon... I never really liked all their songs. but I did have about one or two that stuck in my mind.  Anyway I had a friend who listens to them, and she was Highly impressed with KOL present album... only by the night. So I had to listen and I loved it. I loved it enough to get my own copy.    Here are my favorites:    1. Closer --> First track on the album.... I love the beat and the way it starts out. The song is about despair, and although thats what it is about, the beat helps it along. It made me feel sad... but in a good way.    2.Crawl --> another good one. Song has me rocking to the beat. love the lyrics.    Manhattan and 17 are also equally good.  Be Somebody is really good.    My most personal favorite is \\"I want you\\".. Its quite catchy.    I have maybe 2 songs that I'm not crazy about, but I would listen to them either way....  Sex on fire is one of the most popular songs off the album. and I know everybody loves it. Its not a favorite of mine.. I'm not sure, but maybe I heard it being overplayed. but its still a good song...    I used to mainly be an R&B, Pop... hip hop kind of girl... Somewhere along the way a few years ago that I expanded my musical taste.. so now I'm into a bit of everything from Rock to Classical music..    I don't buy albums often, but when I do, its because its a Darn good Album that has more than 2 hits on the album...  and this Album constitutes as a Darn Good One.

031606792X|3.0|Ok folks, let's remember the target audience for this series is young adults, so if you want better written fiction, pick a more prolific/experienced author. I read the first three books and they were engrossing enough that I didn't get nitpicky on a couple of typos and the repeated use of descriptions like \\"tightened\\"--it doesn't matter really because the author is relying very heavily on the reader's imagination throughout the series.    I saw the bad reviews on book 4 but I bought it anyway just to complete the story.  Book 4 is hilarious! I see now why Stephanie Meyers added \\"comedy\\" to the book/series description. I love the chapters told from Jacob's point of view, he is such a smarta$$.  Yes this one could have used more action at the end, but kids aren't buying the book for action, they're buying it for romance.  So, given that I do have to agree that the whole marriage /honeymoon chapters definitely needed MORE, what's done is done, it's published. Let's move on.  Oh, and yes, Bella pretty much gets everything she wants (just like Barbie) at the end and why wouldn't she?  She is the epitome of stereotypical \\"white girl\\". It makes perfect sense to me.  What doesn't make sense is that Midnight Sun was never completed (see SMeyers official website).  It's much more interesting a read. So much is written from Bella's point of view, I was left wondering what Edward saw in her and how much he had to go through to deal with her as well as deal with  his feelings for her (both romantic and vampiric) and what little there was to read in Midnight Sun answered that question.

B0021L8UPS|1.0|Thank goodness I was only out a rental fee for this turd.  This movie was terrible. It had the feeling of a bad made for TV movie.  I guess the director saw \\"The Bad Seed\\" from many years ago and since coming up with new materials is apparently so difficult, made some slight changes and ended up with a poor version of it.    The \\"Russian\\" orphan character is just plain stupid. Its predictable. The movie is not scarey.  The twist at the end is so dumb I started laughing.  The girl who played this character tried to look mean, but just came off as pathetic. A little girl walking into an intensive care unit and doing what she did, undetected...c'mon.    Don't even waste a $2.99 rental fee for this one.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|With all the wonderful films that Pixar has produced over the years, it takes a special film to stand out among the others. Up is that film. I wasn't sure what to make of the preview, which featured this grumpy old man sitting on a porch of a floating house held aloft by thousands of baloons. The film is so much more than that. It's rediscovering the adventure of life when you think there's nothing left. The opening montage, which shows how two people meet, marry, and grow old together, is perfect. You understand how this old man is the way he is. The adventure begins when his home is threatened by urban development, and his ingenious and original way of dealing with it. Ed Asner is the absolute perfect choice for Mr. Frederickson, and all the voice actors are spot-on with their roles. The speaking dogs are wonderful, and how they speak is a refreshing take on how to portray talking animals. The visuals are stunning, which is what we've come to expect from Pixar, but these are exceptional. The attention to detail is down-to-the-minute-detail. I saw this film in 3D at the theater, which was an experience, and I maust say there really isn't anything lost in viewing it in regular play. The sound is just right, without over-whelming the voice tracks, which happens a LOT in movies anymore. You know what I mean; you're listening hard to catch the dialogue then get blow out the back wall by an explosion or gunfire. I didn't get that in this film. All in all, this film is one of Pixar's finest, and that says everything.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|This is a very funny romantic movie with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.  Scenery is beautiful.  The standout performance in this movie was by Betty White as the grandmother.  She made this movie to be the wonderful movie it is!
0743455967|4.0|Is the book perfect?  Of course not.  Stephen King writes best-sellers, not masterpieces.  But if you are an aspiring writer and you haven't invested ten bucks and a day or two of reading to a writing memoir from one of the most successful authors of the past 35 years, then you should ask yourself if it you're really serious about becoming an author.  Even if you take only one piece of knowledge from the book, it is a worthwhile investment.    King didn't ramble on a lot about the same stuff that you read in every writing book; this is a memoir of King's writing life, not a \\"how-to\\" guide.  That said, it does contain a lot of useful information and is great to read when you need motivated to stop making plans and excuses and to just sit down and put pen to paper.
0385504225|5.0|I enjoyed reading The Lost Symbol a lot. I couldn't stop reading especially the second half which is more thrilling. Dan Brown again gives quite a number of historical data which is mostly gathered again in the second part. I am very much satisfied with the conclusion as well.

B00267N3DQ|5.0|Remastered and remarketed as the movie that started it all, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS remains a triumph of animation. Using the Brothers Grimm tale about the princess with the skin as fair as snow who is taken in by a group of seven dwarfs, Walt Disney fleshed out the characterization of most of the main players while also watering down some of the more graphic and disturbing elements of the story. The movie had been in production for years and Disney gambled his entire future on the project. However, the development took so long and the picture cost so much money that before its release it was known around Hollywood as \\"Disney's Folly\\". But, Disney put the critics to rest and the film would become not only one of the most beloved animated films, but one of the most popular films of all time. The success of the picture paved the way for Disney to expand his company from a small in-house production company that created mostly shorts to a major Hollywood studio.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is rather straight-forward. Princess Snow White's stepmother is a wicked and evil queen and the most beautiful woman in her kingdom. She knows because she asks her Magic Mirror every day. Then one day the Mirror reveals that her stepdaughter, Snow White is more beautiful than she. The Queen is furious and orders a woodsman to take the girl into the woods to kill her. He takes her into the woods, but cannot deliver the blow and tells Snow White to run. Snow White runs away and stumbles upon the cottage of seven dwarfs. She becomes a kind of adopted mother for the little men and they shower their affection upon her. However, the Queen learns what has happened and sets out to put Snow White into a deathly sleep that only can be broken by true love's first kiss.<br /><br />Even though the movie is over 70 years-old, it's still gorgeous. Audiences nowadays have become accustomed to the slick, chic, and sleek animation of CGI. Those style of films are enjoyable to watch, but there is an eloquence and a personality of the old hand-style of animation that is lost when a film is done through CGI. Since it was the first of its kind, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is one of the best examples of classic animation to watch. For example, watch the scene where Snow White is getting water from a well and the camera shows us what it looks like from viewing up the well, through the water, ripples and all. It's a difficult scene that looks gorgeous and it was all drawn by hand. Simply magnificent.<br /><br />The Diamond Edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is basically the Blu-Ray edition of the movie with a DVD thrown in to try to lure people who don't really want Blu-Ray into getting Blu-Ray. The DVD only features an audio commentary, a music video with Tiffany Thornton, a sneak peak at the upcoming THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, and a series of trailers for Disney DVDs. Meanwhile the Blu-Ray discs are loaded with all kinds of features, but since I'm still not going to jump on the Blu-Ray wagon, I can't watch any of those.<br /><br />Overall, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a must own movie for any Disney fan, film student, or person who enjoys animated movies. If you don't already own the movie on DVD, the Diamond Edition of the movie is worth getting because Disney will be putting the movie back into the vault and it won't be available again for years.ere is an eloquence and a personality of the old hand-style of animation that is lost when a film is done through CGI.

B000002OX3|5.0|This is a damn good album that everyone s*** on and I never understood why. It's the only album that all the members pen their own material. It was actually a step up for Pete, John, Roger & Keith to do something different. Sure Happy Jack isn't on it but so what, that doesn't make it any less of an album. It's got a lot of good cuts such as \\"Whiskey Man\\", \\"Don't Look Away\\", \\"So Sad About Us\\", & \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\", & bonus tracks like \\"Disguises\\", \\"I've Been Away\\", & \\"In The City\\". I personally don't think The Who ever made a bad album and I think the 60's Who is the best decade of the Who. But don't get me wrong, I love 70's Who, as well. Quadrophenia(My personal fav) , Who's Next, Who By Numbers are The Who at their Peak!
B001H9MYPW|4.0|There's a deep and wide hunger for intelligent entertainment among the TV audience worldwide. It is this need that this show satisfies like no other. Still, don't forget that it is , finally, highly dramatized, in its adaptation from its foreign origin.    The acting here is superb. I am especially impressed with editing and some of this credit must flowback to HBO and the cable platform - Each scene is allowed to play out until the emotional tone has registered and setled , whereas in network TV, there would be a rush to cut to a commercial.    I give 4 stars because:  A> At times, the writing felt a bit trite, stretched and artificial;  B> Some thematic probabilities were too unrealistic -  \\"Paul's ex landing up at the dooer of paul's therapist just when Paul reaches there and also the same moment when his childhood girlfriend is leaving\\" ; One character's cell phone running out of battery without her awareness so that she could not say that one senetenece that she wanted; Wouldn't Paul's outbound land line have caller id blocked?; How come Paul opens the door to his aprtment -  which does not have a peephole - without checking /asking who is outside?  C> 5 star reviews would set the expectation too high and may disappoint some critical viewers.    It is a very fine collection andam recommending it heartily - still, i think that the entertainment/theater content is way more than any scientific therapy process content.
0740785508|4.0|I decided to take my time reading James Gurney's book on Imaginative Realism. This is not a step by step how to book. This book is more of Gurney's thoughts and ideas on how he creates his masterpieces. He's sharing that kind of thought process with you. The setup of the book is rather nice, the introduction then the History of Art and what studies were done so that a student can achieve a believable and realistic looking piece. The book briefly goes into materials but don't expect Gurney to share what brand of oils you should use, or color palette. From there, he talks about creating the beginnings of your work - preliminary sketches. The rest of the chapters highlight various ideas on people, archaeology, creatures etc.. Near the end of the book you get ideas on composition, various studying techniques, and personal favorite chapters for me were the Procedure and Careers.<br /><br />Procedures gave me a bit more insight on painting techniques such as use of impasto<br />Careers highlighted various careers and fields one would be in, some of the ones I have forgotten about were designers for theme parks as an example.<br /><br />He includes a glossary of terms so if you get lost in artistic lingo - you got a spot to reference.<br /><br />Overall I was satisfied with the book since many of the tools he used was demonstration of using live model/ photo reference in a proper manner. It was good to see how Gurney explains how to change things up and not eyeball the reference too much because reference is a tool and not a crutch. The other amazing part of this book was to see how much work Gurney put into making Marquettes (models) and miniatures to use as reference for his paintings. Sculpting is a good way for an artist to learn and understand how to make a 2d illustration come to life with proper lighting and form.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book a full five stars is that the captions to various pieces in the book were a bit confusing. It was hard to tell sometimes which was being referred to in his examples, and sometimes his captions weren't as specific. For example had an \\"above, right, bottom right\\" and there were four images. I suppose a small numbers system by the images being referenced to could help, or just better caption placement to avoid confusion. I don't want to over-blow the issue, as it wasn't really taking away the overall enjoyment of the book. However, it did it happen enough where it made reading a bit confusing.<br /><br />Overall, beautiful work! If you're a James Gurney fan you'll definitely enjoy this. As an artist I enjoyed the examples that give me ideas and what kind of work I'm expected to do depending on the career - art job I am assigned to.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be putting down the book for a while and will keep it nearby when I'm stuck for ideas.ferred to in his examples, and sometimes his captions weren't as specific.

I found myself dancing around the house, reliving memories of past beach days and just soaking up the sounds of summer.  You sing along, dance along and just wrap yourself in the talents of the Beach Boys music.  The CD lived up to all expectations and beyond.  Immerse yourself in this music and let it take you on its journey from the early hits of their beginnings through to the later hits that still resound with that uncomparable style that only the Beach Boys can give us.    The very best of the Beach Boys is the VERY BEST!
0452295548|5.0|This was a fascinating selection for our book group November 2009. There are some things the book does not do. It does not discuss all kinds of strokes but is limited to the kind Jill had. It also does not discuss any differences there might be between male and female brainedness which is something discussed in books like \\"Brain Sex: The Real Difference Between Men and Women\\" by Anne Moir and David Jessel but that might be significant in both the occurrence of a stroke and the impact/ recovery afterwards. This may be especially of importance if male brained individuals are less likely to recover. Apart from issues of this sort, the book does describe some things that seem incredibly useful not only to care providers but to those of us who might use these insights in controlling their own brains. Jill discovers ways to control her attitudes towards things by interpreting some attitudes as right brained and others as left brained. This enables her to choose and she unabashedly chooses the right brained attitudes having discovered she is not fated to have a certain type of character but instead can choose what kind of person she will be. Some of this may related to a book from the 70s called \\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes\\" at least with regard to the relationship between right and left brain ways of thinking. Apart from a stimulating read Jill's book leads to stimulating discussions that might not necessarily be on the book but about personal experiences that seem pertinent in light of the book.
B00005JM20|3.0|Having just discovered that Mr. Atkinson is a major star worth a great deal of money, I imagine many who might read this are fans of previous work. For them, I should think, this will be a diverting exercise with a variety of verbal and visual laughs. For those with no such connection to him, I should say that this is a minor comedy built on a bumbling secret agent. It has some laughs, is generally lightly amusing, and is of a length which doesn't permit boring stretches. Supporting players add a measure to the pleasure. All in all, nothing to go out of the way for, but not tedious. Not a bad way to spend less than an hour and a half.
B00009R86L|5.0|Some of these other reviews seem to give the idea that this is the miracle pad, but this is not quite so in my opinion. A heavy bag is a heavy bag, but this cushion definitely makes it easily manageable. It is easy to put on any strap, and it does stay in place, the only downside to that is you got to get it in the sweet spot, but once you find that life is good. I ride with my bag on a motorcycle and this helping it stay put is a huge plus. It is all in all a great pad. cushy and comfy, stays put, and is fairly priced. I've had this thing for a month or two now, and I put bags through rough treatment, and this is holding up very well, I don't see it breaking in any way anytime soon. So if you need a little extra cushion and security this things pretty good, also goes great with guitar straps.

B002V0WN2K|5.0|IIIII LLOOOVVVVEEE BON Jovi. Their albums are so awesome.  I think they outdid themselves on this record. I love the lyrics and melodies. It always has a message for me when my life is terrible. Im so glad they are still around. They  should get nominated for grammys and ama's. This album is that good!!! we were born to follow is my favorite song on the record. ITs my life was  my graduating song of 2001. So YEah im loyal!!!!!
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|Nice to see how Clint's character changed his tune after getting to know the neighbors. Its an eye opener on the reality of gang violence too. The movie was sad though as he made the ultimate sacrifice to save the kids and teach them to make the right choices. Clint Eastwood was great.
0783240236|5.0|LOL Universal must have profits reaching all time highs as they do not seem to want to sell a DVD-SE of this title to the millions WHO STILL OWN DVD PLAYERS, who have no intention of getting into BR.  Id fire the whole board of directors-they plan on selling 2-5 million BRs and skip a potential sale of 30-50 million DVDs.        ---  STRANGELY Universal started releasing 2 disc SE titles from the 2005 restored Hitchcock box, then abruptly...stopped    PSYCHO  VERTIGO  THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY  REAR WINDOW (?) so far Maybe TORN CURTAIN and ROPE    MARNIE is from the 2005 MASTERPIECE SET, but before they decided to make them super deluxe standalone titles in 'book' form  LIFEBOAT was a shock to watch after viewing the MASTERPIECE SET-FOX should have been shamed into restoring it    I anxiously await THE BIRDS SE
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|It is a good movie, but my wife is Deaf and can not enjoy this movie yet again (since we saw it at the theater) Also our Deaf friends and their children are excluded. This is a real waste of money for us. The movie companies are getting greedier and greedier.. shame on you Disney.  **Today and email was in my box via the Disney store says \\"The box states that it has captions for the hearing impaired, spanish (etc) and closed caption.\\"  Well, the box SAYS IT it must be true!??  (Tested on several systems)  WELL THEY STILL AIN'T WORKING!!
1416972242|1.0|The hypocrite in me will probably read the third book too- of course, who am I to break up the series? I mean after all, I plodded through the 4 wasted weeks of my life that were the Twilight saga. Now those books were really something! And not the good kind, of course. I mean, those books were so bad, they made the Inheritance saga look gold.<br /><br />But basically, Cassandra's books are GREAT if you like reading:<br /><br />1) The Mary Sue character. We've read several books with these before- the House of Night books, the Twilight books, A Thousand Splendid Suns, etc. You name it. That's right, we have the character that has EVERYTHING perfect and survives everything. Her name would be Clary Fray, of course! If you thought her Mary Sue-ness pushed the boundaries of the first book, wait till you read the City of Ashes.<br /><br />2) Lazy writing/Even lazier editing/Zero-level characterization. I don't have anything against Clare at all. I think she can be a good writer if she wants to be. But she needs to learn how to make characters that are at least Remotely interesting. THe only interesting character is Jace- a cool, stylish, slick guy with a good sense of urgency. And if you thought her making up words in the first book was bad, again, wait till you read this book! She does it SEVERAL times here, whether it be be fanfiction level phrases or turning nouns into verbs. Oh, and halfway through it felt like Clare got lazy and said \\"Hey, I wrote a real hit! No need to proofread of edit this!!!\\". Who was her editor even? And WHere was the editor, too? Was he/she on a hot beach sipping wine coolers and not caring about how poorly written it was?<br /><br />3) Fanfiction level plot. If it walks like a Harry Potter, talks like a Harry Potter, and acts like a Harry Potter, it must be Harry Potter, right? Nope, it's The Mortal Instruments. Reading these books seems as though you are in a bad deleted scene from the Potter movies/books. It's basically the lovechild of Harry Potter, Buffy, Star Wars, and Twilight. But who am I to judge, I've read fanfictions that are better than this! The thing is, if this were actually a fanfiction, I would have rated it higher (but certainly not by much). So one should wonder exactly people in the right mind would rate this above two stars?<br /><br />Yes, it's true, I despised the first book and gave up 267 pages into it. However, I then had second thoughts, so I finished the book and I guarantee you, it was only MARGINALLY bettter than the first half! I'm not saying I hate these books. At least not the concept of them. Jace is a cool character, the Shadowhunters are cool, there's lots of humor and imagery, but these books are like a really bad fanfiction- so poorly written but hilarious that way.<br /><br />But even then, it's still better than Twilight.d Twilight.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|THIS ITEM IS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING.  ELVIS' VOICE IS SO CLEAR AND ON SOME OF THE SONGS THEY ARE DONE DIFFERENTLY THAN ORIGINALLY RECORDED.  I WOULD RATE THIS AS  A NUMBER 10.    I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANY ELVIS FAN.
B002LE6XR2|1.0|Lamp is just flopping around broken at the neck of the lamp. I don't want to return it because it's out of stock from Amazon and I know they won't replace it. What a disappointment.
B002FE5XVK|4.0|This review is primarily a comparison of the standard DVD to the blu-ray.  See other reviews for more discussion of the performance itself.<br /><br />First, to be clear, I love the Talking Heads of this era (and earlier) and this concert. As many have said before, Stop Making Sense is one of the best concert performances ever captured on film. Poorly captured, unfortunately.<br /><br />I've owned the standard DVD for years, and have viewed it on my Oppo 970 upscaling player at least 50 times. I know (and love) the content very well, warts and all. I eagerly awaited the release on blu-ray to improve the blurry, soft, artifact-laden DVD.<br /><br />Sadly, on my 106\\" screen (fed by a Pioneer BPD-51FD blu-ray player though an Epson 1080UB), the video on blu-ray is so similar (poor) to the DVD that I consider it a wasted purchase. What makes it even WORSE than the DVD, is that all the grain, scratches, and film defects are greatly enhanced by the sharpness of blu-ray. When a scratch comes along, it's presented in high definition, making it leap out even more than it does on DVD. The sharp detail of the defects screams out how bad the source really is. Monty Python's Life of Brian was similarly horrific on DVD, but the restoration processing used for the blu-ray transformed it astonishingly to near perfect. I had hoped for SOME similar improvements on Stop Making Sense, but this blu-ray is a dud in my opinion. I see only moments of improved detail, but so little as to be of no consequence. Some reviewers feel that this is part of the films' charm and artistic intent. I respectfully disagree - strongly. The bad video quality just looks like sloppy, inept film making. The concept, direction and performances are wonderful, but the images look like a 4th generation VHS tape. Sadly, apparently all the existing copies of the original film used to master the DVDs and blu-rays are apparently equally awful.<br /><br />Audio IS improved on the blu-ray, however. Notably, audio lip-sync problems are much better than the standard DVD (particularly on 'What a Day That Was') . Yet this also helps to emphasize how bad the image quality is. Great audio combined with high-def film grain/defects make the soft, crappy images seem worse than ever by comparison.<br /><br />I wish I'd never bothered to upgrade to this blu-ray, my old DVD is essentially equivalent on a good upscaling player.<br /><br />Ultimately, Stop Making Sense is an essential, desert-island DVD, although poorly-filmed (picture quality-wise).  I adore the content, but wish that there would be an attempt at restoration, even if some purists might object.  Until then, the added resolution of blu-ray is a waste, at best.  If you own this on DVD, don't bother with the blu-ray version.<br /><br />[...]
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Nothing, of course, can compare to actually going to a live show by The Killers, but this DVD comes close.  I am amazed at the quality of the video and the quality of the sound.  Watching the video had me jumping up and down and singing along just like at the real show.  The different camera angles keep it interesting.  I especially like the fact that there are close-ups of the drummer.  In a typical show he's hidden away in the back of the stage behind the singer.  But in the DVD, you can really see his work.  The show includes the best songs from every album.  Many of the songs are different versions from the album version which makes it very special.  This is such a great deal in that you get a DVD and a live CD.
B000005JA8|1.0|I have tried 4 times over the last decade to listen to \\"Trout Mask Replica\\". In my attempts, I have managed to make it thru the entire album once. I guess it must finally be rubbing off on me.<br /><br />Why do I keep trying? I keep seeing this album turn up on those \\"greatest albums of all time\\" lists...most recently it's listed in the book \\"1000 Recordings To Hear Before You Die\\". So there must be something to this. So I keep trying...<br /><br />So I do hear what others may be hearing...this album is pretty much the equivalent of taking pop music, avant-guarde jazz, beat poetry, Delta blues, dadaism, spiritual field music...pretty much the whole of American beat culture in the 60's, putting it in a blender and hitting \\"frappe\\", all under the watchful eye of Frank Zappa. And in many ways, I can hear its influence in other experimental bands over the years. So I can trace its place in modern recording history.<br /><br />However, just because someone calls it art doesn't necessarily make it art. One could take s--t and smear it on a wall, put a frame around it and call it art...and you can see why the artist did it, what he was trying to do, the point he was trying to make, it's place in art and its history and admire the artist and the art for what it stands for...but in the end, it's still s--t.<br /><br />And that, in a nutshell, is \\"Trout Mask Replica\\".
006019250X|3.0|it drives me nuts that it is not often mentioned  that this story was based on a tale from the 1001 arabian nights.  not to say that coelho's version doesnt add anything new or is a pleasant enough read. it certainly is a lighter read than borge's version of the same tale..but at least borges makes it clear that his version is based on a tale from the 1001 arabian nights.
0439023483|5.0|This book is a quick read and quite enjoyable. There's not so much relationship development in this book as there is action, which a lot of people probably prefer. I, personally, like relationships. But, this book was still very good. Lots of action, lots of twists. Very well-written.
1401323820|3.0|If you like light and lively reads, this is a fast one. Not deep or profound, and I doubt it was intended to be. Feels more like something quickly dashed out to complement the TV show by a writer (or writing team) with talent. Fluff, yes, but fun to read and entertaining. Good escapist fiction.
0765356147|5.0|If you read either of my other reviews you'll know just how enthralled I am by this trilogy. I came into this trilogy late, and rather reluctantly, but boy am I glad I did! The questions had regarding the differences between the skaa and the nobles is answered, who the Kandra/Koloss are, the nature of allomancy, plus a whole host of others are very satisfactorily answered. I won't lie--some of the more philosophical explanations went over my head, but that's to be expected. Sanderson had set up some hefty mysteries that weren't just in the present, but had haunted scholars all throughout the Final Empire's history.<br /><br />As before each chapter begins with a short quotation from the person who, presumably, was recording the events. Right away we are told the person is the much mentioned Hero of Ages, but who is the Hero of Ages exactly remains a mystery till later on. It makes sense, after all is said and done, but I dare someone to figure it out beforehand.<br /><br />The book, the trilogy overall, also drove home something that I've begun to want more often in my 'heroes'--a sense of moral grayness. No one--not the Lord Ruler, Kelsier, Vin, Elend, etc--is just one side of the coin. For all the fact the Lord Ruler commited atrocious acts--he also prepared for the day when things would be MUCH worse. For all of Kelsier's grand plans to 'free the skaa' he was a man who was broken (mentally) and thought only in terms of extremes. Vin understood herself the best I think, even when in doubt. Survival mattered--survival of herself, of those she loved, of those she wanted to protect--and survival meant you couldn't do things the pretty way sometimes. Elend...he tried and I think if he didn't try, things might have been better for him.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much honestly. A lot of what made this book so great relied on revelations of things you need to read to feel the impact of (origins, motivations, etc). I will say that much like the characters in the story can't take anything not written in steel as truth, don't take anything for granted. People will surprise you and in this I think at least, the surprise is often the best.not written in steel as truth, don't take anything for granted. People will surprise you and in this I think at least, the surprise is often the best.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|This is MICHAEL JACKON doing what he does best. And it is a great DVD. I watch it all the time and my friends have watched it may times with me. I have gotten alot of new MJ fans over this DVD. He is georgeous, on top of his game and all good songs! It's one I just cannot stop watching. They do show a bit too much audience for my taste (because I don't want to miss any Michael), but I would recommend it to everybody who even remotley likes Michael. By the time you see it, you will be a true fan and know what he was capable of...genious!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'll keep this short. I've been listening to this music since it was new and I was a child. I'm a ways away from my childhood, but this still sounds brand new. I buy a considerable amount of music each year and this is the best money that I've spent in a very long time. If the engineers that remastered this set don't win the technical Grammy this year, then the Grammys have completely invalidated themselves (not a big stretch). Buy it, invest in a decent pair of headphones, and enjoy!
1845767055|5.0|This book is great, worth it worth it. The whole book is filled with paintings of fantasy, dinosaurs, mythical and other themes. His technique is too good. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to study painting, composition, perspective and drawing from the imagination. You won't regret this purchase.
1400032717|5.0|This is one of my favorite novels and I found just as much joy in reading it the second time around as I did the first.  It is so perfectly simplistic and unencumbered with sentiment and superfluous imagery, told from the perspective of a 15-year-old autistic boy, Christopher.  I adore his stream-of-conscious narrative which seems so straightforward and logical despite his inability to function on a social and emotional level.  The escalating conflict is tangible and I could feel Christopher's frustration as he confronts the unfamiliar.  His diversions of math, reason and habit are often unintentionally humorous and lend insight to Christopher's distinctive mind.  This is an extremely well written book with an incredibly engrossing and gratifying story.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I don't watch much TV at home, but caught one of the early episodes in a hotel room while traveling for work.  The combination of intrigue plus the sci-fi/horror plot line grabbed my attention right away; these shows typically hit the ground running.  Then I see this familiar face on one of the characters, an actor I've seen before, and then it hits me - Dr. Walter Bishop, played by John Noble, was Denethor in the Peter Jackson \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy, where he played the warped, abusive father of Faramir, the guy who sets himself on fire and runs off the cliff.  Now here he is playing another role as a crazy man, but this one is also lovable and often hilarious!  As soon as I saw that I was hooked - I can watch the show just to see Walter - John Noble is a tremendous actor and the cast is uniformly excellent.  I have only good things to say about the show.
0882709194|5.0|Ray Comfort Says it best. Best intro ive ever read. This really gets you thinking in a more positive way and a more intelligent one. Ive changed my ways of thinking. Thanks Ray! I ordered some other materials of yours as well. Cant wait to read more.
B001JDS7CU|5.0|I bought this because I borrowed my friend's DVD version of it, after viewing two discs, I decided to own one. The blue-ray version of this is better than the DVD counterpart. I had chances to compare the DVD one and the Blue-Ray one side by side, it IS different. Now, whenever friends come by, this is the disc for me to show off the big screen TV. I never heard people saying any negative words about this serials, everybody was impressed by what the mother nature has given, everybody has always their astonishing mouth opened with the 'wow...', highly recommended it, and thanks BBC to make this excellent contribution to the world.
0385504225|2.0|I am about 3/4 finished reading this book; I may never complete it.  I am very disappointed, I waited for it to be published, purchased it ASAP, hoarded it, putting off starting it to savor a great read.   It is boring, what else can I say?  A weirdo run amok l just gets to be too much.  Why doesn't someone just kill the 'evil one' and put him out of his ego driven misery?  Covered with tattoos,  he \\"hides\\" them on his head with makeup, come onnnnn, that's ridiculous. All the other mumbo-jumbo just makes it easy to put down hoping it will get better...but it doesn't.    That's it for me!  My red knob popped up, I'm done with it.  Done like a turkey.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|The Killers: Live at the Royal Albert Hall is one of the best concert films I've ever seen. The Killers truly are one of the best live bands today, and this disc stands as a testament to that fact.     I first bought the CD/DVD package, and then, since I loved it so much, I decided to buy it on Blu-ray. Let me tell, the sound and video quality is incredible! If you watch it on your TV, and turn the volume up really loud, you almost feel like you there in the audience!     Spaceman, Human, I Can't Stay, All These Things That I've Done, Bling, and When You Were Young are my standout favorites, but each and every song they perform on this disc is amazing! All their best songs are on here!
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I'm a big MJ fan so I had to buy this. It is a bit of a disappointment and lost opportunity. On one hand I enjoyed having top songs on one cd (I don't own any MJ compilations) so I don't have to keep changing cds. It was also nice to hear the demos and the poem.     However, I did expect more from this product - perhaps more demos or some interviews or short dvd clips from This Is It (ie thriller) or something...something!...this is just MJ recycled with a little something new. It would have been nicer to have a cd+dvd set (ie the dvd movie and the cd to go with it) but I guess this is part of the commercial business...the dvd will come out separately and so will other bits and pieces of what we have left of our beloved MJ.    The photos were a big disappointment - they could have done something better with them. Half of them didn't even have an image of MJ. The pre-description of the product was a little off reality!
B000YA9LK6|5.0|I have read this book several times and it is a wonderful Christmas story. Its a nice book to give to any one who has children or enjoys a heartfelt child likeness. The Gift set is such a good deal and the memories it will bring for years to come is well worth the little extra cost..
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My son, my Mother and I went to see \\"Up\\" in 3D in the theaters and loved it!  It was very sad in the beginning (I thought I was going to cry) but it ended up being such a great movie with some funny moments (\\"squirrel\\"!)  It was definitely worth the money to see it in the theaters and purchase the dvd.  I would recommend this movie to people of all ages!
0684824906|5.0|Plenty of people have reviewed this book. Let me just add a couple of reasons why you might enjoy this book:  (1) Through the way it approaches Lincoln's presidency the book provides insights into the US at the time as well as Lincoln's leadership style. So many interesting issues intersect in this book that you end up learning about everything from military tactics to the broad issues of slavery. In addition, Lincoln's days were filled with the great struggle to hold a nation together as well as more personal struggles as he dealt with the loss of his son. As a subject, the Lincoln presidency is hard to beat and this account is hard to beat.  (2) It's a very readable (but long) account of a tremendously important historical figure. I've read a lot of good books on various presidents and this one gave me one of the best views of any single book I've read. Theodore Rex (by Edmund Morris) and John Adams (David McCullough) are the only other volumes I can think of that provided such rich insights and were so enjoyable to read.    People can quibble over the details and a few southern apologists will reject any positive Lincoln biography. However, Team of Rivals is one of best books of its type and should be near the top of any reading list on US history.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Just when you think Nickelback can't get any worse, they release yet another album full of musical diarrhea.  A lousy combination of mindless raunchy lyrics and zero musical talent.  Nickelback are the founding fathers of a new genre of rock: \\"Trailer Park Rock.\\"  Others in this genre include Theory of a Deadman, Puddle of Mudd, etc.
B00005JPSM|5.0|Such a fabulous movie that I needed to add to my collection. The delivery from the seller was quick as can be.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|Some reviewers complain about this album because it doesn't live up to the standard set by the 1970s version of Lynyrd Skynyrd.  They're right, frankly, but let's face it:  Nobody on earth can live up to that standard.  Other reviewers complain about the theme of some of the songs (\\"jingoistic garbage\\").  My response to that criticism consists of two words: Fort Hood.    After 9/11, the song that remained in my mind was Steve Earle's \\"Jerusalem,\\" a hopeful (but ultimately naive) dream for a better future.  After 11/5, the song that stays with me is Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"God & Guns,\\" which is a much-needed hard dose of reality.  For those of you who prefer Obamica to America, this album is worthless.  For the rest of us, it is essential.
0525951113|4.0|Do you like techno thrillers? Does the idea of killer computers make your spine tingle? If so, then you'll probably like this book. Not only is it a techno thriller, but it tries very hard to sound authentic & (as far as I know) it succeeds.<br /><br />The plot of this book is incredibly diverse, spanning multiple characters and places. In one spot you have a detective who is rather bitter about life, having had a child at a young age & married the mother out of obligation. In another you have a sociopathic young hacker who steals identities and cares little about who gets hurt. In yet another you have a web game creator who has long passed, yet left something behind that could ruin humanity as we know it- the Daemon.<br /><br />I was recommended this book via another review & I decided to follow up on that recommendation. I'm glad I did. The beginning of this book is just incredible & the plot idea is an intriguing one. In most of the \\"killer program\\" stories out there, the program creator is still alive & is using it to control everything. The idea that someone would do this in his final days is interesting- what were his reasons for doing so? What does he hope to accomplish? I also liked that the techie stuff in the book sounded legit but was explained enough for the knuckleheads like me who aren't as techno savvy.<br /><br />I'll give a little spoiler & tell you that we don't find this out in this book because this was intended to be followed up with a sequel or two. There were parts of the book that dragged a little, but the book was good enough that I will get the follow up book when it eventually releases.
0316069906|5.0|No one who picks up 'Eating Animals' will enjoy what they read; several people close to me have told me they're afraid to read it because they know they'd either have to change their eating habits or feel guilty when they ate.    For those whose ethics forgo efforts to emulate the ostrich, this book is a must. What we do to animals in the name of our taste buds is appalling. Also horrifying is the concept of what you're actually putting in your mouth, if you still eat meat: diseased mutant animals are the rule, not the exception.     We often wonder how those who stood nearby as injustice occured could have tolerated it; we sneer at their claims of \\"not knowing.\\" If you read \\"Eating Animals\\" and fail to act - or avoid the book because you like a good burger - than you have lost your right to judge others along those lines.    Reading this riveting, distressing piece of non-fiction provided me with a \\"Soylent Green is people\\" moment I have not been able to shake since closing the book. We were already vegetarians, though we had thought it safe to buy \\"cage-free\\" eggs, not realizing that the term is a marketing ploy, not a promise of cruelty-free products (the opposite, actually). And I had no idea how truly and routinely cruel the life of a factory farmed animal is. Lifelong torture of chickens, turkeys, fish, pigs and cows is - again - the rule, not the exception.    Bravo to Jonathan Safran Foer for carrying the fight against factory farming to us in a way that makes us truly understand what a humanitarian, health and environmental horror story it is.
0786838655|3.0|So far I've only gotten through the first two books in this series, but based on what I've read so far, I can pretty well predict the pattern for the remainder of the series. Young demigod Percy Jackson, bedeviled by monsters, prophecies that he can't figure out, and nasty plans laid out by fellow a demigod, the evil Draco--oops, I mean Luke, son of Hermes and co-conspirator with Voldemort--oops, I mean Kronos--who wants to destroy Hogw--yikes! I mean summer camp! Sheesh! Where the mudbloods--I mean mortals--rely on a halfblood prince--I mean heroes--who--oh, forget it!<br /><br />Get the picture?<br /><br />It's too bad, because in some ways Rick Riordan is a more polished writer than J.K. Rowling. You'll find no 80-page wand battles, and the universe of Percy and his half-blood friends is more coherent than Rowling's. His prose flies off the page; he knows how to pace the action, and he puts his background as a mystery writer to good use by cleverly placed clues, macguffins, cliffhangers, etc.<br /><br />He also does a highly entertaining job of integrating Greek mythology into the series of hair-raising and humorous escapades that Percy and his friends Grover (a satyr, not a puppet!) and Annabeth (daughter of Athena) find themselves in. As a son of Poseidon, Percy discovers a special affinity for water, a kind of superpower that comes in handy when battling evil. Riordan has transferred the world of Greek mythology to the U.S. (see my quibble note, below), with Olympus hanging out over the Empire State Building and the underworld Hades, appropriately enough, in a seedy part of Los Angeles. Not all of his mythic characters are gods, either--for example, a hilarious version of Medusa shows up, selling stone garden statues of the people she's turned to stone with her deadly look. Riordan is well-versed in Greek myths, but you don't have to know Hades from Hermes to follow the story. So kudos for that.<br /><br />But Riordan doesn't measure up to Rowling in several key areas. One is gravitas. Harry's parents were murdered by the Evil One; Percy's dad is Poseidon, a god in a pretty darn comfy position as Zeus' brother. Whereas Kronos, a creepy Titan who was cut up and caste into a deep pit in Hades, doesn't come across as particularly interesting, at least not yet. The monsters that attack Percy all seem like descriptions of CGI monsters; instead of dying when defeated they burst into golden light or something. Give me a break!<br /><br />Another area where he comes up short is in Percy's new home, Camp Half-blood. Rowling's Hogwarts is utterly charming, and the machinations of magical politics is brilliantly conceived. Percy's summer camp is, well, boring. It's run by Dionysus, of all people, who here has the personality of a turnip. I mean, come on! Sure his followers got out of hand at times, and in a book for kids you can't have scenes of them tearing apart people in wild orgies, but Dionysus was more than just the god of wine, he was the god of theater, and only Athena was more honored in Athens. Yet for some reason young Percy seems to find the camp just peachy. I guess it beats being a dyslexic kid with ADHD trying to deal with reality as we know it, but the camp definitely needs some tarting up. It's just as well that Percy spends almost all of his time out on the myth road, or he'd probably die of boredom.<br /><br />What about the intangibles? Riordan's characters are definitely kid-oriented, esp. since Percy is the narrator. They have that combination of sass, bravado, and, I don't know, kidness, that pervades the contemporary kidlitscape. Rowling's characters are more varied, and when they're funny, they absolutely kill me. Riordan doesn't have any deliciously funny grownups like Gilderoy Lockhart or Reeta Skeeter or Dolores Umbridge. His plots are not nearly as labyrinthine (though I've yet to read Riordan's The battle of the Labyrinth). And while some of his minor characters are satirical in a fun sort of way, theylack Rowling's bite. Perhaps, as with Harry Potter when he grew older, the Olympians series will acquire a bit more bite and appeal to an older demographic. I sure hope so.<br /><br />QUIBBLE NOTE about Riordan's world. We are told that the reason why Olympus has moved from Greece to the U.S. is because the U.S. is now the dominant culture in the West, and the gods follow the dominant culture. The U.S. has culture? Really? Guns, for sure. But the Greek gods didn't go trotting after the Persians when they were the dominant military force (despite their famous defeat by Greece, Athens was hardly a world power; it took the Macedonian Alexander to do any conquering). No, ancient Greece had wonderfully creative myths and amazing storytellers and historians who brought it all together--they were the world's great artists and thinkers of their time. You can't convince me that the U.S. is anything like ancient Greece in this way.<br /><br />At least Riordan's flexes his storytelling muscles in a way Uncle Sam would approve. No opportunities to take creepy tea breaks in haunted castles, Percy is out to kick monster butt, and if you want to take it at that level, hey. Go for it.<br /><br />P.S. Want more middle-grade or YA fiction based on Greek mythology? Check out Jane Yolan's Young Heroes series, Esther Friesen's Nobody's Princess (a very original take on Helen of Troy), or Donna Jo Napoli's poignant The Great God Pan.

B00000DFSK|5.0|I really enjoyed this period of U2s music.  After purchasing this and reflecting back while listening going down the road lets you know that this was their peak period in time.  It wound up being better than they probably thought it might be when they were working those years.
0786868724|1.0|Always with an eye to making money, this journalist excels in the art of making superficiality a new skill.  The secret?  Mix a rabbi and a black inner city minister together, add some droll humor and pathos, combine with a totally simplistic outloook, and you have the journalistic equivalent of \\"how to make money without really saying anything\\".  The book is a pathetic read, as you get booged down in Albom's typical aphorisms.  He's got a formula for making money and reader's love the simplistic outlook.  He's made the money and the joke is on me for buying the book.
B000NJVWU0|3.0|The fourth album from the Alan Parsons Project went for the biggest question of them all. Forget [[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 Science Fiction]], [[ASIN:B000001FN3 Classic Horror]] Lit or [[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Egyptian Mythology]]. This time, it's the battle of the sexes. It was one mighty topic, and The Project had more apple in their teeth than they could chew. It is the most average of The Alan Parsons Project's earlier albums.<br /><br />The problem lies in the songwriting. By trying to divide it into a male and female half, the men are portrayed as misogynistic (\\"You Lie Down With Dogs\\") or harpies (\\"I'd Rather Be a Man\\"). The women as either weak and needy (\\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\") or devious and even deformed (the infamous hipgnosis artwork). There was also the issue that Parsons and Eric Woolfson note in the liner that they were under deadline pressure and had to veer away from the original concept. One wonders what might have been should the artists been allowed more time to develop their original ideas.<br /><br />As such, \\"Eve\\" seems to be half a great album. \\"Lucifer\\" became the first of the wildly popular instrumentals that APP became known for. \\"Damned If I Do\\" became a Top 40 hit. And one of the rare APP songs with a female lead, \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\" sung by Lesley Duncan, is beautiful. The orchestrations by Andrew Powell are some of APP's best on record. I love the sounds on \\"Wind Me Up\\" in particular. The remastering brings these details out far better than the old CD version.<br /><br />The new \\"Eve\\" offers one extra treat among the bonus tracks, a piano instrumental from the legendary \\"Sicilian Defense\\" album. Now titled \\"Elsie's Theme,\\" it's a pleasant work that was never fleshed out. Again, wondering what might have been had Parsons and Woolfson not been jammed up by their record company. Two albums later, the APP turned out their greatest success ([[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]]), and \\"Eve\\" was part of the journey.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|A well-produced and fresh-sounding compilation of alternate versions, B-sides, and comparatively obscure tracks, Past Masters might only be appreciated fully by a die-hard Beatles fan.  But for those of us who ARE this collection is a rare treat both as music and as memorabilia.  While the thoroughly impressive job done in remastering the recordings is icing on the cake it's still well worth the investment in upgrading to a new copy for anyone who's remotely interested in high-quality audio.    Casual fans might safely give Past Masters a miss and folks who aren't in the habit of spending time fine-tuning the EQ on their stereo system for that 'perfect sound' may not appreciate the nuances of the remastered tracks, but Past Masters is a must-have for any serious Beatles fan with an ear for good sound!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I habe several of Michael Buble's cd's and this is one is favorite. I love the music and the style and ease he sings them. The first day I got in the mail I played 5 times in a row it was so good. I reccomend this to any one who likes his music it's FANTASTIC.
B000058983|5.0|There is very little to say about this album that hasn't been said before. This is one of the greatest rock albums ever made. Period. Every track is a masterpiece. The album as a whole is the product of genius. If any album on Amazon deserves 6 stars, this is it.
B00003CXD5|5.0|In my opinion, one of the best movies of all time.  Probably Humphrey Bogart's best movie and Walter Huston is excellent.  A tale of greed, adventure and descent into madness which covers many aspects of human behavior.  As always, older movies are not as slick as current releases, but this movie has the acting and script to make a modern movie viewer take interest.  The movie is directed by John Huston (Walter's brother), who also appears in a cameo role.  I have to admit being a sucker for black and white movies from the 30's and 40's.  They just don't make them like this any more!
B001J8NQPS|5.0|you see all of these type of special releases from japan such as the shim releases that are suppose to be an up grade from the standard cds and they are to a degree however this version of this classic SIMON and GARFUNKEL album  is the most outrageous upgrade i have ever heard.BRIDGE has been my favorite S&G album since i first heard it when i was 16,ive never heard it before like this.it sounds like it came out yesterday the clarity,the instruments,the voices,if only the beatles cds could sound like its unbelieveable,beautiful disc glad i spent the 36 bucks.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The minor disappointments I had with some little items are buried by the amount of great things that is the Star Trek Blu. The packaging is the single hinged chassis with cardboard slip cover, but the info sheet (typical rear cover art) is a hot-glued paper that cannot fit anywhere once it comes off. The resulting Blu art front is a head shot of Pine and the back is Quinto.<br /><br />The picture is as good as would be expected, with plenty of great space effects, the heavy lens glare that Abrams likes does not bleed too bad but ILM does not disappoint. They went with TrueHD which gives an adequate immersion, some of the best tests were with Spocks ship and that unique  sound (but 7.1 DTS would have been nice). Plenty of reference points throughout, but even with that clarity I still couldn't get a read on some of the little things (tried freezing the fence signs in the Corvette scene, freezing some of the panel displays to read what the actors were looking at, etc.). But what takes the time and is worth every moment for the supplement geeks like me is the entire disc 2.<br /><br />Disc 1: Menus are unfortunately only minimal still animation (no live action or HD pics).<br />Commentary by the makers.<br /><br />Disc 2: Blue screen animated left sided selections. Most items pop up with an \\"extended\\" option that has an icon appear when watching each documentary to facilitate viewing little snippets of additional material, or each one can be watched individually - no play all on anything with this disc.<br /><br />* 16:41 To Boldly Go. Several extensions including the Kirk dilemma (1:58), more Green Girl stuff (3:25). The main piece covers aspects of creation, whys and what fors. All of these supplements are HD interviews of the filmmakers spliced with low def footage (past and present Treks).<br /><br />* 28:53 Casting. Once again all HD present footage mixed with grainy low def shots of behind the scenes - gives some good material on why we saw who we did.<br /><br />* 24:33 Starships. Concepts, art design and some of my favorite stuff on the making of regarding construction. Seven extensions are selectable here including Warp Drive and Paint stuff.<br /><br />* 16:30 Aliens. Shows the meetings and thought process behind some of the critters and humanoids. Five extensions here.<br /><br />* 16:10 Planets. Some nice history for Trek regarding the Vasquez Rocks, which showed an obvious deleted sequence  - made me look forward to those even more.<br /><br />* 9:22 Props and Costumes. One extension here about Klingons - which led to another whole deleted sequence I was now REALLY wanting to watch them.<br /><br />* 9:45 Sounds. I enjoyed this one the most as the sounds intrigued me when I first saw this in theaters. Nice homage/respect paid to the old series connections.<br /><br />* 8:47 Gene Roddenberry vision. A nice history with at least half of it being Nimoy narrating/being interviewed (there was a blatant absence of someone here but you will notice that through this entire set).<br /><br />* 13:30 Deleted Scenes - FINALLY. Play all option with commentary on/off of Abrams, Kurtzman.<br />- Spock's birth. Throughout all of these you notice Winona's entire screen time was removed. Nice little plug on how he gets his name.<br />- Klingon battle with the Narada, effects unfinished - which leads into an entire storyline removal - did not agree with the reasons for the removal but oh well.<br />- Dysfunctional home life of the early Kirk sequence. Explains who that kid was on the road and who the voice was on the car phone.<br />- Spock's parents arguing about which side Spock should embrace.<br />- Klingon Prison Planet sequence - wow. I want this in the director's cut. Would have explained a great deal of how Nero and the Narada disappeared.<br />- Vulcan sequence prior to destruction (Vasquez Rocks).<br />- Kirk and Green Girl - can never have too much of that. Once you see this you can find out what Uhura and Kirk were really talking about in the theatrical cut (Klingon Prison - not battle).<br />- Scene involving more Green Girl and Kirk defeating the Maru test - good scene.<br />- Kirk apologizing to Green Girl - had to go once the others were cut.<br /><br />* Simulator: Mix of animated and slight HD footage of interactive material on the Enterprise and the Narada. The vast majority of material centers on the Narada (weapons, propulsion etc.).<br /><br />* 6:22 Gag Reel. A brief retro title sequence followed by a hilarious slew of swearing by even the best (priceless watching Nimoy cuss his lines).  Fast paced and fun.<br /><br />* 3 trailers.<br /><br />Everything subtitled in French, Spanish, & Port.<br /><br />Disc 3. Digital copy and game demo. Did not use either.<br /><br />Overall, I had a great time going through all of this and I honestly think even the discerning Trekkie will be happy with this product. Yes, I feel the deleted scenes should have been left in as they explained some obvious gaps in the film, but at least we got to see them. The HD screenings have been very popular and I don't tire of watching this through and through.

B0015AARJI|3.0|the PlayStation three controller is a quite good controller, the dual shock works but not near as good as a wired PS2 controller, I have only used it with a couple of games one is resistance the other is MLB 07 the show and the six axis does not seem to work very well, I would have rated it a four star but the price is way too much for this controller it is basically twice as much as a PS2 controller therefore I think it is really a big rip, but what can you do the aftermarket controllers are not as good, the Logitech wireless is a very good controller but not quite as good as the PS3 but it can be bought for much less.

9113020730|5.0|I've loved Stieg Larrson's work since I found the first book \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" (M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor) when I found it in a bookstore in Sweden a few years ago.  I anxiously awaited the second book \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" (Flickan som lekte med elden) being translated into English and was thrilled to be able to read it this summer.  Now I'm the thrilled owner of the last book in this wonderful trilogy, \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest\\" (Luftslottet som spr&auml;ngdes) thanks to the graciousness of my Swedish friend.  If this is the first you've heard of Stieg Larsson, PLEASE go back and read the other books in this trilogy first, it will make it even more exciting for you!<br /><br />From the author's website, the plot summary:<br /><br />Two seriously injured people arrive at the emergency ward of the Sahlgrensa hospital in Gothenburg. One is the wanted murderer Lisbeth Salander who has taken a bullet to the head and needs immediate surgery, the other is Alexander Zalachenko, an older man who Lisbeth has attacked with an axe.<br /><br />In this third novel in the Millennium trilogy, Lisbeth is planning her revenge against the men who tried to kill her, and even more importantly, revenge against the government which nearly destroyed her life. But first she must escape from the intensive care unit and exculpate her name from the charges of murder that hangs over her head.<br /><br />In order to succeed with the latter, Lisbeth will need the help of journalist Mikael Blomkvist. He is writing an exposing article that will shake the Swedish government, the secret service and the whole country by its foundations. Finally there is a chance for Lisbeth Salander to put her past behind her and finally there is a chance for truth and justice to prevail.<br /><br />Sound exciting?  You have no idea.  I loved this book as much as the other two and keep hoping that \\"someone somewhere\\" has other things the author had written before his premature death.  Don't miss this!!!

0385504225|3.0|I've read all the books written by Dan Brown.  After the DaVinci Code, I couldn't wait for his next book.  It finally arrived and I was a bit disapointed.  It just seemed to me that he wanted to write a big book and made up a bunch of useless chapters.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the book but it did seen to drag a bit.  The characters were well written and the mysteries in the book were well thought of.  It was just missing that \\"I need to keep reading to find out what happens\\" aspect that the DaVinci Code had.

It tries to salvage itself from pure spectacle by injecting gooey interpersonal dynamics and unremarkable class/power/politics commentary.     Low expectations will serve you well.

B0006GANN2|5.0|The absolute brillance of French Connection is not the story, a pretty straightforward one about an obseesed cop and a drug dealer. The absolutle brillance is in the story telling.<br /><br />From the word go, we do not follow the story as much as feel it. Detectives Doyle and Grasso start their tail of a drug dealer on a hunch late at night and this extends-unexpectedly-to morning. Both detectives are cold and tired, told by the slow walks and rubbing of worn eyes. \\"Its eight in the morning.\\" Grasso jabs at Doyle, and you hear the break in his voice.<br /><br />The pursit continues as \\"the frog\\" comes from France. In probably one of the most viceral scenes ever filmed, the drug smuggler takes his connection to lunch in a gourmet resturant and the detectvies wait outside. They eat cold pizza and drink watery coffee. Doyle has to move his feat to avoid numbness. He blows into his gloves and rubs his hands together. Suddenly, we as viewers start to feel cold.<br /><br />All this materfully conveyed viceral detial is not a flash of technique. Undercover is exausting, frustratining work, and this is told by Friendkins use of micropoints. He shows us how cops burn out.<br /><br />Friendkin may be our best director not because of what he shows us but how he makes us feel what he shows. He is the only filmaker I know  that can make me feel tactile sensations the way most great autaurs make me feel emotions. Scorcesee may be more consistent and yes, I have never seen Martin shoot a frame that did not have perfect composition and more texture in one shot than most commercial features pack in one film. He is by far our America's most consistent film genius. But if I want to feel cold during a summer heatwave, I go to Freidkin.<br /><br />French Connection takes paitiance, especially by today's quickie cut MTV editing standards. But with Friendkin, the message is in the medium, and if younger viewers can adapt to the slower pace of this 1971 film and wait with Doyle and Grasso, their effort will be 100 fold rewardedded
1416594787|2.0|I have studied the pros and cons of evolutionary theory for years and I've followed Richard Dawkins' writings for almost a decade now.  In his introduction, Dawkins explained how in his previous books, he worked from the assumption that evolution was true, whereas he planned to give the actual case for evolution against creationism.<br /><br />I was excited to hear some new evidence for Darwinian evolution and thought to myself \\"This should be good!\\"  Dawkins is a good scientist, and even though I can't think of any personal scientific research he laid out in this book, he explained quite a bit of interesting 3rd party data.  The observational science was really interesting, but then he took off his lab coat and tired his hand at amateur philosopher in this book again.<br /><br />It would take more space than I have available to detail all his problems, but I'll hit some of the highlights.<br /><br />1. Improper use of the law of excluded middle-  He set up his understanding of unguided macro-evolution against young earth creationism as if they were the only alternatives.  He didn't mention any form of what he called \\"old-earth creationism\\" until about ¾ of the way through the book.  He mentioned guided theistic evolution in the last chapter when he explained the Gallop poll data in more detail, but never made any arguments for or against either one of them.<br /><br />The criticism of Darwinian evolution that has the most traction today comes from Intelligent Design.  Although Dawkins mentions the terms \\"irreducible complexity\\" and \\"intelligent design\\" in passing, he never addresses the ideas behind them as put forth by their main proponents.  Interestingly, Dawkins continually refuses to debate Steven Meyer on Dawkins' own specialization; (a telling piece of information).<br /><br />2. Begging the Question- Begging the question is of course a form of circular reasoning in which you assume your conclusion in one of your premises, whether it is a spoken premise or an enthymematic (unstated) premise.<br /><br />Dawkins does a good job of proving evolution is true by assuming metaphysical naturalism is true.  If metaphysical naturalism is in fact the case, then some form of evolution really would be the \\"only game in town\\" as the t-shirt reads.  Materialists going back as far as Epicurus (4th century bc) thought everything in nature was the result of random causes upon atoms.  All Darwin gave us was the mechanism.  If you could show (which he never tries) that metaphysical naturalism were the case, you could reject any ID theory that doesn't include aliens (which he mercifully left out of this book).<br /><br />An excellent example of Dawkins assuming metaphysical naturalism would be his view of the origin of life.  He says that it most likely only happened once in the past and further said that must have started out quite simply because it is statistically improbable that anything should come into existence with complexity rather than simplicity.  It would be unlikely indeed for DNA to come about on its own naturally, but nobody Dawkins is arguing against thinks DNA (or RNA for that matter) came about on their own, but that it was intelligently designed.  If there is an engineer at the base of it, we have no reason to think that life couldn't start off with complexity (which we see in the fossil record with fully formed bacteria and sponges which apparently contained DNA).<br /><br />Another example would be His evidence from the fossil record and homology, which only prove evolution if you assume Darwinian macro-evolution is true at the get-go.  (hardly useful)<br /><br />3. Equivocation - Equivocation is when you use the same word in different places of an argument, but change the meaning somewhere along the way.  Evolution is a word that has at least three definitions.  (a)Change over time, (b)Minor variation and speciation, like dogs in their many forms all coming from wolves. And (c) Macro-evolution where yaks probably came from yeast and sea anemone and giraffes have a common ancestor.  This third definition also implies the entire sequence is a result of blind, drunken, unguided processes.  Dawkins gives some really interesting examples of definition (a) and (b), (as I mentioned above) but commits the fallacy of equivocation in using evidence of(a) and (b) to somehow prove (c) which the evidence does not warrant.<br />All in all, this was an interesting book, with its many stories and pictures.  Some of the points he made tended to answer the questions nobody was asking and further tended to droll on and on with what seemed no end in sight.  Additionally his prose style is nothing to write home about, but at the end of the day, he's a Biologist, not an English literature scholar.  At the end of the day, it seems he does a good job of showing young-earth creationism is not too likely, given our present scientific evidence.  He also gives some good evidence for change over time and limited speciation, which his opponents in the ID community don't take exception with.  Thus claiming to prove evolution is a fact more certain than the holocaust is extremely overstated.<br /><br />Evolution: The Greatest Show on Earth, still the only game in town (for the metaphysical naturalist)<br /><br />p.s. I predict most of the negative comments to this book review will be ad homineum in nature, though I hope to be wrong.stor.

0802798225|5.0|Simone Elkeles's Perfect Chemistry really has some perfect chemistry.  Okay, seriously, puns aside, I put aside a book that I BOUGHT and had wanted to read for months (and yes, I had started said book) to read Perfect Chemistry in approximately 24 hours--this time frame does include going to school and work, by the way.      This book goes back and forth between gang member Alex Fuentes's and cheerleader Brittany Ellis's perspectives as they are paired up as chemistry partners in class.  As you can guess, neither are particularly happy with the arrangement--especially not Brittany's quarterback boyfriend.  As the two are forced to spend time with each other, they realize they have more in common than they thought, and, as you probably guessed, the two fall for each other.  Unfortunately for these two love birds, falling turns out to be the easy part because even while the two learn to overcome their differences, those around them are hardly supportive.    While not the most surprising of plots, both characters are charismatic in their own ways and the story moves quickly.  I definitely found myself turning the pages as fast as I could and had the hardest time putting it down (hence the 24 hour read).      For anyone who loves a good romance, teen drama, or bad boys with good girls, this one's for you.    PS--A bit mature.

0385504225|1.0|I've never written a review before but I felt compelled to comment on this book. The writing is dull and the plot is utterly absurd. I flipped through it as fast as I could just to get it over with. It's a stupid rehash of his two previous books, and they weren't worth revisiting.
0385504225|2.0|I really liked all his other novels, but this one was slow going. I hate chase scenes, and this novel was filled with them. I fear that a good hour of the movie will be nothing more than tedious chase scenes and unlikely last second escapes. The ending was unsatisfying too, but I won't spoil that. I did wonder at the end what all the fuss was over, not to mention all the blood spilled. The cardinal sins, however, were the \\"logic gaps\\" -- where any number of highly improbable things happen that are essential to keeping the plot moving, without the establishment of a reasonable foundation for them. Hitchcock did that all the time, but this is a different age. Just one example: Why does the CIA lady just let all the mystical evidence stuff walk out the door with Robert and Kathleen, when she knows a dangerous madman is trying to get his hands on it? Sorry folks -- it would never happen in real life. His other novels were logically consistent and had real pots of gold at the end of their rainbows. Still I wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading it, just temper your expectations.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Titanic has been my favorite movie and love story for a long time, but now Australia is right up there with it.  One of my all time favorite movies!!  It is such a beautiful love story of romance, friendship, and family.  Some movies you 'feel' and others you don't, and I really 'felt' this one.  So romantic, interesting, funny, exciting, entertaining, intriguing....definitely one to see!!
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Seems like the centerpiece of this movie is a certain sex fantasy (I won't offer a spoiler) involving Scarlett Johansson. Stilted dialog, wooden acting- I found the whole thing implausible, and the characters completely unsympathetic. I give the movie two stars only for the stunning scenes of Barcelona.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|I really like the original Rocky movie.  I forgot how amazing the writing is.      I mean, come on- it's about a boxer who has to compete in the biggest match of his life thus far in his young and already pretty beat-up career.  How can you make a great storyline out of a rather lackluster idea?    By having the story focus significantly on the boxers life, and by featuring a steady and quiet storyline build-up to please those of us who love a good drama, and even include a charming quality in the atmosphere along with great character development by everyone involved in the film.      Sylvester Stallone may be the main character, but all the other characters are equally terrific.  It's nice to have some variety.    The portion of the film dealing with Rocky getting to know Adrian was well-executed, and perhaps even better than the boxing match itself.  Absolutely great writing material.  Adrian is such a shy woman, in fact, more shy than I've EVER seen a woman before, and that kind of personality appeals to me personally.    This is the film where we learn about all the characters that would make more appearances and play major parts in future Rocky movies.  Most of the movie focuses on getting to know the characters, and less on the fight itself (even the dramatic build-up to the fight was short and sweet).    The boxing match itself was fun to watch, though I wish the writers would have included a bit more of the match itself, instead of skipping ahead several rounds.  I won't reveal who won the fight, but you might get the same impression I did over who really won the fight based on the amount of material we see.    So yeah, the film is obviously dated a bit, Sylvester Stallone is quite young here, the movie does a tremendous job showing viewers what it's like to wander down the dark, empty streets of Philadelphia in the middle of the night, and this movie is just the beginning of what would deservedly become a classic film series over the years.
B001B0AY68|5.0|I didn't notice when i purchased it, but for the blu-ray version, all German cover and German dub seems to be the default sound and subtitle, though it does come with English DTS HighRes 5.1 sound and English subtitles, but the title menu will not change to English. None the less a GREAT movie!
160094048X|5.0|Is deliciousness a word? It should be. You can't go wrong with anything that Isa and Terry cook up, but this book is particularly amazing. Any kind of cookie you can think of, it's in here. This morning I made the Hazelnut Fudge Dreamies and they are amazing. The cookies are fluffy and light and the filling, well, it's chocolatey and rich. I've also made the Mexican Hot Chocolate Snickerdoodles, Peanut Butter Blondies and Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows and all are consistently delicious.    Buy this book. You will not regret it.
0061914177|5.0|\\"Developing your personal brand is key to monetizing your passion online.\\"    That's a quote from the new book \\"Crush It! - Why NOW is the time to cash in on your passion\\" by Gary Vaynerchuk. If you haven't heard of Gary Vaynerchuk you should check him out. Billed as the \\"Social Media Sommelier\\" Gary produces an incredibly a popular video blog called Wine Library TV. Gary helped transform his family's wine business from a $4 million business to a $60 million business, by simply leveraging the power of the web and social media tools.     Crush It! is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning more about the benefits of personal branding or starting and promoting a successful company through the web and social media. The book is about 1/4 motivational speaking and 3/4 reasoning for starting and successfully promoting your own business. The book provides several great sample business ideas, real world success tips and recommendations/explanations of useful online tools.    In the book, Gary goes so far to suggest that even if you have a job you like you should quit and start your own business - and that now is the best time to do it. Moreover, if you don't like your job (waiting for Friday every week and living for you vacations) Gary strongly suggests that you're wasting your time. He qualifies this only with one thing - his first rule is that you must first and foremost always do what you have to do to take care of your family and put them first.    What I like most about the book is Gary's encouragement for people to find their passion and figure out a way to monetize it. He suggests that doing so will change your life. No longer will you dread every day trying to slog through your daily job routines. When you're doing what you love your life and your job are one in the same - and that's ok with you.    I wrote more about this on my blog: [...]

B0026NWBY2|4.0|I didn't give it 5-stars because it doesn't include my wife's and my favorite George Harrison song, \\"The Art of Dying.\\"  I especially liked the 1-star reviews as they showed me what else I need to find in his catalogue to become a true fan.  To echo those one star criticisms, I quote from the fine glossy booklet included with the disc:<br /><br />\\"Let it Roll: Songs by Geoge Harrison, is a gathering of material that takes us far into the territory that was ultimately a place unique to George Harrison.  Here was an individual writing songs such as \\"The Art of Dying\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\" while still in his twenties, a giant of popular music whose life so often defied what we think we know of as the pop star\\".<br /><br />But, guess what?  \\"The Art of Dying\\" is not included in the material!

B0032KNA4I|1.0|I was among those with great expectations about this movie, curious about the approach chosen regarding to the 2012 Mayan prediction, and looking forward for the spectacular special effects (SFX) shown in the trailer. However, the movie falls shorts in both aspects, and particularly its relationship with the 2012 is practically just an excuse to produce an catastrophic end of the world movie, as the Mayan prediction is just casually mentioned a couple of times (for the different interpretations of this phenomena see the documentary [[ASIN:B001IF5PCE 2012: Science Or Superstition]]).<br /><br />Regarding the SFX do not get misled by the trailers, great scenes are limited to two, the California earthquake and the Yellowstone super-volcano, and both are full of exaggerations just aimed to spice the action. The destruction of Rio de Janeiro, the Vatican, and the tsunamis are just very brief scenes, so, even SFX fans will be disappointed as there is a lot of not so interesting and often boring dialogues between the SFX catastrophic scenes. Finally, even though it is normal to expect quite a dose of exaggerations in a movie like this, these guys overdid it, e.g. both airplane stunts are really childish, and cellular phones still working when the world is falling apart?<br /><br />And as for content and message, the movie is very poor in these departments too. Not only the acting is cardboard, but the storyline is incredible close to the [[ASIN:B00005JNTI War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)]], divorced father, the kid gets alone better with his step-father, .... Furthermore, the modern Noah's Ark closing segment completely misses the climax of the storyline, and also misses to opportunity to deliver a real message. Sincerely, at this point I was just wishing for the movie to end. What a disappointment!!!<br /><br />And just in case you are wondering that I was too harsh, by early 2011 NASA has rated \\"2012\\" as the \\"Most Unrealistic Sci-Fi of All Time\\" as this flick leads NASA's list of the seven least plausible science fiction movies ever made. NASA commented that 2012 was considered the most absurd sci-fi flick of all time.NASA's list of the seven least plausible science fiction movies ever made.

0307266303|5.0|If you are not a runner, this is just a great read, well crafted and engaging. If you are a runner, it's valuable and wildly entertaining. And if you're a runner who, like me, has suffered from chronic injuries, it's simply indispensable.    For starters, Christopher McDougall is a gifted writer. He's managed to seamlessly weave together several narrative threads into a story that moves along as gracefully and effortlessly as the runners he describes. He introduces a fascinating cast of characters, including the enigmatic Caballo Blanco and the eccentric Barefoot Ted, along with some of the more noteworthy figures from the recent history of long distance running. To all of that, McDougall adds an iconoclastic analysis of running technique that, for me, represented nothing less than salvation. After running a marathon in 1986, my legs gave way to injury and pain. Over and over again, I tried to return to running but to no avail. The same relentless pain kept coming returning, dashing my hopes each time. Today, I am running again... AND NOTHING HURTS. And, as an added benefit, I'm running faster than ever. Finally, McDougall describes a fascinating 50 mile race in which he participated through the Copper Canyon of Mexico.    Simply put, Born to Run is the best book about running I've ever read. Easily and by a mile.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|While I read many good reviews here prior to making my purchase, I was initially worried when I also read many negative reviews here mentioning poor product packaging, product arriving in poor shape, product missing the episode-guide booklet, episodes not in chronological order (?), missing discs, and damaged discs that would not play properly among other problems (one review mentioned a disc where the laugh track was audible but dialogue was not?!). I went ahead and ordered thinking I would inspect it right away and return it if it was flawed in any way ($134.99 is a GREAT price although I guess I just missed an all-time low price of $114.99). Not only did I receive the product promptly (less than 48 hours after the order went through). It arrived in perfect condition. I immediately tested all 40 discs (playing the start of random episodes on each disc) and I found NO PROBLEMS (by the way, the episodes ARE in chronological order and each disc DOES have a main menu which makes it very easy to go to any specific episode). I sympathize with those who received a damaged or incomplete product. I, for one, am very happy with my purchase. Not only am I satisfied with the product. Amazon.com's price, free shipping option, and speedy delivery time met my expectations as well.
1565117700|3.0|Two things prevents this product from receiving 5 stars.  One is the fact that the copy I received was scratched and skips in many different parts.  The second reason is that the CD does not have any sort of guide to let one know where the audio starts and stops.  If one is listening to it continuously, it is not a problem.  Gary Sinise does a good job reading the different parts.

B002T09BPE|1.0|I've been awaiting a domestic release from her.  After seeing her on Clapton's Crossroads blues DVD and watching her play with Santana on various PRS annual videos, I was hopeful.  Too bad she took the \\"pop\\" route and did an album that is way below her potential.  She is a blues demon and yet this album is so \\"commercial\\".  Such hope and such disappointment.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|It's actually been several years since I have listened to any of the Beatles CD's released in 1987.  After listening to all these remastered CD's of 2009, I will have to say, it was definitely worth the wait!  I listened to all of the CD's on this stereo with a bass speaker.  To me, they sound phenonmenal.  You get to hear an efficient balance between the vocals and other instruments being played. Of course, the loudness of the vocals have to be sacrificed, but that's just the the way stereo versions work.  Anyway, with that said, I'll talk about the albums individually:      PLEASE PLEASE ME:  As we all know, this is the first Beatles' studio album. It consisted of songs that they has played previously during their Cavern and local club days. (The Cavern was one of the clubs in Liverpool, England that the Beatles' performed at prior to their stardom years.)  It features Lennon and McCartney songs like \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\"  and well as songs written by people the Beatles' admire, such as \\"Chains\\" and \\"Boys\\"    WITH THE BEATLES:  As with their debut album, this is a fine one.  It features new songs by John and Paul, like \\"Little Child\\" and \\"Not a Second Time\\", songs by their heros like Chuck Berry's \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" and Meredith Wilson's \\"Till There Was You\\", as well as George Harrison's debut for songwriting, \\"Don't Bother Me\\".    A HARD DAY'S NIGHT:  These consisted of songs written for their first film of the same title.  This has songs in the movie like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and songs not featured in the movie like \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" and \\"Things We Said Today\\".  This happens to be the only Beatles' album where all the songs are written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.             BEATLES FOR SALE:  This album was when the group started to expand their musical horizons.  You have the pessimistic messages in the Lennon-McCartney song \\"Baby's in Black\\" and \\"I'm a Loser\\", which was inspired by some songs of Bob Dylan.  Along with these, you have songs written by some of the group's heros, such as Chuck Berry's \\"Rock 'n' Roll Music\\", Buddy Holly's \\"Words of Love\\", and Carl Perkin's \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\".    HELP!:  The album here contained songs for their second film of the same title.  It has the rocking title track, \\"Help!\\", the folk-based ballad, \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" \\"Ticket to Ride\\", and the McCartney classic, \\"Yesterday\\", (which was originally titled, \\"Scrambled Eggs!\\").  This was also, the time when Bob Dylan had introduced them to marijuana.  Therefore, you could say that some of the music and lyrics was inspired by these drug phases.    RUBBER SOUL:  Once again, the Beatles were expanding their musical creativity.  In the Lennon-McCartney song, \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\", George played a sitar, an ancient Indian instrument.  John also wrote songs depicting human introspection such as \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Nowhere Man\\".  Paul was writing tender ballads like \\"Michelle\\" as well as more songs on a personal level such as \\"I'm Looking Through You\\".  George contributed the songs \\"Think for Yourself\\" and the Byrds-flavored \\"If I Needed Someone\\".  The jacket cover was taken by Robert Freemen, (who has been their photographer ever since WITH THE BEATLES was released.)  This photograph happened accidentally when he was protruding slides of his photographs on a card the size of a record or LP.  The card then fell backward and somewhat stretched one of them.  All four members immediately insisted this one to be on the front cover of the RUBBER SOUL album.  So Robert complied.    REVOLVER:  The Beatles' horizons in being creative were ever-so growing.  It consists of three new songs by George Harrison:  The rocker, \\"Taxman\\", the Indian-inspired, \\"Love You To\\", and the moderately paced, \\"I Want to Tell You\\".  It also features innovative Lennon-McCartney songs.  Among them are the following:  The classic-inspired, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the folk ballad, \\"Yellow Submarine\\", as well as the LSD-influenced songs, \\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  The jacket cover was unique for its time.  Klaus Voormen, an art-student friend in Hamburg when the Beatles performed in the city during their early years, drew line sketches and combined them with a collage of photographs of the Beatles.    SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEART'S CLUB BAND:  The Beatles stopped touring and playing at concerts at this time.  Therefore, they wanted to put all their time and energy into the recording studio.  That's exactly what they do here.  Paul once replied \\"Let's pretend we're not the Beatles.\\"  That's how he came up with this imaginary title for the album.  The group wanted to use more and more instuments; from those used in orchestras, to tape and electronics, to the guitar and drums, to the sitar.  You get it all here.  You hear rockers like the title track, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", rockers like \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\", and the sitar-inspired song, \\"Within You and Without You\\".  I as well as many other people consider this album to be the epitome of the \\"Summer of Love\\" in 1967; time of the hippies, people avoiding the draft for Vietnam, Timothy Leary's \\"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out\\" message, and free love.  The jacket cover was fasioned by Peter Blake.  He made it inspired by John and Paul saying to him that the group was imagining them selves as some other band, that they would perform in a park, and all these people would come and watch them.  So, Peter would grab photographs to make into a collage, bring in wax figures, and well as flower and plant arrangements.  All this would make as stated about Revolver, a unique album cover for its time.       MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR:  I personally don't hear too much of a  difference between this album and the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album because many of the sounds still sound 'psychedelic'  The differences are that it consists of some new songs that were put into a television film of the same title.  That's not to say that \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is not a great album.  All the songs are well-written, well-arranged and innovative.  It was released during the end of the year of 1967, and became successful.  It contains new Lennon-MCartney songs used in the movie such as \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"The Fool on the Hill\\", and \\"I Am the Walrus\\" as well as songs released previously such as \\"Hello Goodbye\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and \\"All You Need is Love\\".    THE BEATLES:  Also known as \\"The White Album\\", this became the first time when each member of the group started to work as individuals.  Sure, they still played together.  But each member would write and record songs for himself.  John would bring in songs like \\"Dear Prudence\\", the rocker, \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\", the blues-flavored, \\"Yer Blues\\", and the folk inspired, \\"Cry Baby Cry\\".  Paul would include rockers like \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"Birthday\\" and especially, \\"Helter Skelter\\"(which I would say was an inspiration for heavy metal).  Paul would also write the folk-based, \\"Blackbird\\", the 20's English/jazz based songs, \\"Martha My Dear\\", and \\"Honey Pie\\".  George would able to write and record four new songs:  \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Piggies\\", \\"Long Long Long\\", and \\"Savory Truffle\\".  Finally, Ringo would write and record the enjoyable song \\"Don't Pass Me By\\".  The recordings were large enough to make the album a two-record set.  Some people complained about this.  However, the album still went No. 1 and became a gold album.  Paul McCartney would retaliate by saying that since the album did extremely well, he did not see what all the fuss was about.  I agree.    YELLOW SUBMARINE: This album consists of songs featured in the Beatles' fourth film, \\"Yellow Submarine\\".  It consists of two new Lennon-McCartney songs, \\"Hey Bulldog\\" a rocker, and \\"All Together Now\\", a folk-based ballad.  Also, it contains two the previous Lennon-McCartney songs, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"All You Need in Love\\", as well as two new songs by George Harrison, \\"Only a Northern Song\\", and \\"It's All Two Much\\".  The rest of the album consists of pieces of film score, both composed and conducted by George Martin, the Beatles' album producer.  Because of this, many people think that this is not a true Beatles' album.  While I can understand where they are coming from, I would defend and say that's what makes this album different from the other Beatle studio records.  After all, the Beatles, did not want to repeat themselves from what they did previously.  Also, while the album did not reach No. 1, either in the United States or the United Kingdom, it sold well enough to give both the Beatles and George Martin comfort. Plus the film itself was well-received, unlike \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\".    ABBEY ROAD:  This would prove to be the Beatles' final album that was made.  This would be made since they were disheartened with the GET BACK album,(which would later be changed to LET IT BE.)  Along with that, they would stop fighting with one another.  John would write and record rocker songs like \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\", as well as the classic inspired, \\"Because\\".  Paul would write and record well-paced songs like \\"Oh! Darling\\", and the black comedic,\\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\".  George would bring in the nice ballad, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and the chart topping \\"Something\\".  Ringo, would write and record the song \\"Octopus's Garden\\".  John and Paul on the opposite side of the album would write and record songs for a medley such as \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\", \\"Golden Slumbers\\", and \\"The End\\".  \\"Abbey Road\\" would go on to become what many would consider, (I myself included the groups' best album.)  It did not feature any studio tricks or exotic instruments which were on \\"Sgt. Pepper\\".  The album also proved that The Beatles could still perform rock 'n' roll as well as have their creativity at their peak!    LET IT BE:   \\"Let It Be\\" is an interesting album as well as a fine one, because it was made when a lot of the tensions and fighting (which started during the \\"White Album\\" sessions) escalated.  Paul's idea for the album was to make a documentary of the group rehearsing songs at Twickenham Film Studios in London and then perform them at a concert.  However, all members of the group were growing tired and constantly arguing amongst themselves and found that the film studio at Twickenham to be cold and uninspiring.  So they took some time off from the album, and eventually moved to the basement studio of Apple located in London's West End.  George Harrison also recommended that they bring in keyboardist, Billy Preston, whom they had met in 1962.  While Billy did decrease a lot of the tensions and the nonsense shown at Twickenham, it did not solve everything.  After the album and film was finished in January of 1969,both got shelved.  Then along came Phil Spector and (against Paul's authorization), rearranged some of the songs with both orchestras and choirs.  Among them are \\"Let It Be\\", \\"Across the Universe\\", and \\"I Me Mine\\".  After a lot of struggles, \\"Let It Be\\" was finally released in May 1970.  Some people have a problem with Phil Spector's involvement with the album, and I repsect their opinion.  But I don't.  I think that's part of what makes \\"Let It Be\\" different from the other Beatles' albums.  It's also a 'funner' album to listen to beacuse you get hear the members crack jokes and make false starts during some songs.    PAST MASTERS:  In 1988, Capitol released this two record set that consists of songs or different versions of songs not released on the Beatles' previous studio albums in England.  These songs were either released as singles or on what they calle EP's(Extended Plays).  Among the collection of songs on this two CD set are the following:  \\"Love Me Do\\"(The original single verion with Ringo playing drums), \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", \\"Day Tripper\\", \\"We Can Work It Out\\", \\"Get Back\\"(which is different from the album version on \\"Let It Be\\"), \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\", and \\"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\\" (which was featured on the U.S. flip side of the \\"Let It Be\\" single.  This collection of songs are great for any casual Beatles' fan who like I said are not too familiar with the songs not released on their previous studio albums.      Each remastered album is finely packaged, (which consists of fold-in CD covers), and features a litte booklet which consists of rare photographs of the group as well as containing information about both the songs and the albums themelves.  Examples, of this are the following:  When the albums were recorded, when the albums were released, when the songs were written, and how each member was inspired to write the songs.    THE MINI DOCUMENTARIES:  This is a DVD which consists of short documentaries about the making of each of the studio albums.  They're not much more informative than the booklets, and I realize that some of the film footage and interviews are borrowed from THE BEATLES' ANTHOLOGY, but I find this DVD to be entertaining enough.      Everybody is entitled to one's own opinion about this remastered stereo box set, but I think it's a masterpiece!  The music is restored well enough to be audible to the human ear, and I think will be remembered and studied for years to come.  Anyway, that's my opinion.  Take it, or leave it!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|IMPORTANT NOTE: Several days ago I received a replacement disk of \\"Gladiator\\" with a new transfer in which edge sharpening and grain reduction have been reduced or eliminated. Paramount insists (see their site) that such enhancement is necessary and correct -- it is NOT! -- and this new edition was made solely to satisfy a number of people who complained. That must have been a /huge/ number, because the cost of remastering and repressing a film is not pocket change. (The new version can be identified by a /yellow/ -- rather than white -- proof-of-purchase tab on the back.)<br /><br />This is typical of the home-video industry. When the LaserDisc was state of the art, some companies (such as Paramount) would transfer beaten-up 16mm prints (eg, \\"Hud\\"), completely ignoring the fact that LV was a medium for movie lovers and videophiles. It's typical of American businesses to degrade the quality of a superior product to the point they think is \\"appropriate\\" for the Great Unwashed.<br /><br />I realize home video is not the same as theatrical presentation (it can actually be a lot better!), and the studio /might/ want to make adjustments for the best image quality. I can understand the desire to reduce grain -- a /bit/ -- and sharpen the image. But when such \\"enhancements\\" are so heavily applied that they /degrade/ the image /and/ the viewer's pleasure, they've gone to far.<br /><br />There is no reason (other than saving money!) /not/ to produce the best-possible transfer -- if only so you won't have to redo it. Those who don't or can't see a difference won't care. Those who do, will. (I just read that Blu-ray now has a 17% -- 1 in 6 -- market penetration in American homes. Amazing.)<br /><br />Only Disney and Warners (which controls its own and several other studios' catalogs) have, as far as I can tell, made a consistent effort to produce superior transfers. Universal is erratic, with a not-very-good \\"Spartacus\\" followed by a beautiful \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy and a superb \\"Psycho\\". (You really /have/ to see the latter. If Mrs Bates doesn't knock your eyes out (ar, ar), the image quality will.)<br /><br />Please read the following with the preceding in mind.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I've seen several reviews -- both in magazines and on-line -- excoriating this transfer for its mediocre image quality. I'm not sure what they're talking about.<br /><br />As for sharpness and real detail, this transfer has gobs of it. Richard Harris is a lined and wrinkled geezer, and the close-ups of the women -- well, woman -- plainly reveal that they're (she's) not wearing makeup.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this is the first Blu-ray I've seen with visible edge enhancement. You will occasionally see trailing-edge overshoot. It's not common, but it does occur.<br /><br />Regardless, the BD's image quality quite obliterates the DVD's. Oddly, the CGI looks much more believable in the Blu-ray than it does on the DVD. I've seen this with other films, and have no explanation, other than the extra detail makes the fake stuff more plausible.<br /><br />As for the film... It's \\"Ben-Hur\\" redux, without the Christianity. The /overall/ arc of the stories are the same -- a man is unjustly accused of crimes, then has to \\"prove himself\\" to the Roman populace. The principal difference is that \\"Ben-Hur\\" is a story of revenge in which the principal character eventually discovers how unimportant revenge is, while \\"Gladiator\\" is explicitly not about revenge, but about a man's desire to return to what /is/ important to him.<br /><br />Russel Crowe might /think/ he's the world's greatest actor, but he ain't. The otherwise-sharp script portrays him primarily as someone who /doesn't/ want to be where he is. It's hard to act /negative/ attitudes, and he does little except yearn and pine and be noble. Perhaps this is all for the good -- the part is better underplayed. Richard Harris is far more effective -- and memorable -- as Marcus Aurelius.<br /><br />Outside of the fact that the story is a broad fictionalization of real people and events, there are surprisingly few (apparent) errors or anachronisms. The principal error is getting the \\"thumbs-up/down\\" gesture wrong. The thumb represents the sword -- \\"thumbs up\\" means cut the guy's throat, \\"thumbs down\\" means bury the sword in the sand. And when Oliver Reed's character complains that his giraffes won't mate -- \\"You sold me queer giraffes!\\" -- it reflects a modern view of sexuality that would have made no sense to Mediterranean people.<br /><br />\\"Gladiator\\" is, overall, an very entertaining and well-paced film -- but it's hardly an Oscar contender. It won because, as with many Best Picture winners, it lavishly combines Spectacle and Sentiment. Though almost everyone dies, there's still a Happy Ending.<br /><br />The extras are lavish, including a 3.5 hour (!) feature on the film's making. The first 12 minutes or so of it were transferred with the wrong cadence, and every time something moves, you see scaning-line breakup.

B001B2KUHO|3.0|First of all, musically, this is a 5-star masterpiece. I've listened to and loved this album for nearly 20 years, since the 3-CD box set was released in 1990. Then I bought the 1996 CD re-master; then I found a nearly perfect original issue on vinyl for about $7; then I bought this. Guess what? THEY ALL SOUND TERRIBLE!!! It's just a murky, messy mix that probably will never be improved without a complete re-mix that probably will not (and should not) ever happen. The bottom line is this $24 LP re-issue sounds just like my $7 original, but with less surface noise.    I'm a vinyl lover and have to say that the 1996 CD re-master is probably the best sounding of the lot, which you can pick up for $11.99 or less. (Please note that I have never heard the now out-of-print 2004 SACD/DSD version.)     Sound quality aside, this IS Clapton's finest hour and his guitar duals with Skydog are absolutely shattering.   If you are interested in owning a comprehensive rock & roll music collection this one is an absolute must.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|Using that most serious of events, a funeral, as a setting for a comedy that has everything from bathroom humor to clever bits about misuse of hallucinogens and sexual blackmail was brilliant. The movie is very tightly written and directed with some very good British actors providing good all around performances. Death At A Funeral is definitely worth checking out for some laughs.
B001V9LPWQ|2.0|Blu-ray discs do not have the same country-region issues that normal dvds have. It's more a question of TV system. I live in Japan, and since the U.S. and Japan TV systems are the same, I can theoretically watch American blu-ray discs in Japan.  I bought the U.S. version of Sleeping Beauty, and it played beautifully on my player here in Japan.  My only regret is that the Disney \\"restoration\\" team managed in screwing up the color scheme of the film for viewers in all countries!    Snow White was released on Blu-ray a little bit prior to Japan. I couldn't wait to see it, so I got one from the U.S. and put it in my Japanese player.  But this time, a screen popped up telling me that certain portions would not be accessible in some territories.  The menu came on. I chose \\"Watch the film\\" with normal view. The screen went black and stayed that way. Then I tried \\"special features\\". Same thing.  I only attempted these two items. Both didn't work. Disc 2 played wonderfully.    So I thought, \\"Well--I guess I'll have to buy the Japanese version, since I'm living here.\\"  To my shock, the items I failed to open in the American disc are now not accessible in the Japanese disc either. It is as if the machine remembers what happened before, and is perpetuating the problem.  And so, my friends, in order to see Snow White in Blu-ray, the only avenue open is to buy another player, one that hasn't been tainted with this \\"bug\\".  What I didn't try to access before was the movie with \\"Disney View\\".  It works, but I find the ever-changing paintings on both sides of the screen very distracting! (Well-painted, but distracting.)    Walt Disney's sole motivation was to make sure the paying public got the maximum of entertainment value from his great works.  It seems that the folks at Disney nowadays have an unnatural obsession with micro-managing things so that they control every little thing buyers of their discs get to see or don't get to see.  The changed colors in the Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray are an annoying example.    I bought the 70th anniversay Blu-ray edition (U.S.) of The Wizard of Oz. Both discs play on my Japanese player like a dream!  THIS IS WHAT BLU-RAY WAS MEANT TO DO.  For their wonderful Blu-ray presentation, I give MGM an A+.  For their trouble-producing bug-infested Blu-ray disc of Snow White, Disney gets a D-.
B002O4J4DO|5.0|This CD set is a collection of the single mixes of every CCR hit from their peak 1968-1971 period.  Warning-they are mixed in mono, so be prepared.  Nevertheless, the sound quality is great and it is nice to hear these classic songs sound the way I remember them hearing when I was 12-13.  This is a must for any collector.
B002K0WBY6|3.0|The movie was cute. I like Sandra Bullock so went ahead and purchased the movie. Not sure if I'll ever watch it again, mostly because it was a bit cheesy and in parts even slow. But it was cute and I enjoyed it for the most part.

9113020730|5.0|5.0 out of 5 stars Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books, November 13, 2009<br /><br />This third installment in Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy (which was originally meant to contain twelve books; due to Stieg Larsson's premature death caused by a tragic and brutal heart attack, it became a trilogy) is easily the best of the bunch.<br />Stieg Larsson is a genious. And there is no doubt in my mind that, in time, he will become known as one of the best crime thriller writers of all time. If not the very best. It made me step back and go \\"whoa!\\" on more than one occasion.<br />There is something complex and magical about the simplicity of his writing. Every word and every sentence flows easily into the next as we follow each of the characters through basically every step of their everyday lives (which, I must say, are nothing at all like my everyday life). At one point in time, we are follow six whole stories at the same time; never once does it seem daunting or overwhelming (even with all those crazy Swedish names). Never once did I feel lost, and I cared equally about all of the stories and their interconnections. Not one small thing is left out, and yet there manages to be nothing superfluous about the content.<br />Because we get to see each of the characters at their best and their worst, doing some of the most mundane things, we grow to know them and all of their complexities without even realizing it. I can easily say, without even giving it a second though, that Lisbeth Salander is the most real and unique heroine I have ever read. And Mikael Blomkvist is up there with one of the most believable, unique heroes I have ever read.<br />Even the secondary characters are well thought-out, well-developed, integral parts of the story.<br /><br />This is a story about being on the wrong side of corruption and about fighting for the basic rights that come with being a human being. It is a crime thriller, to be sure, but this book is accessible to everyone (well, grown-ups at least). Stieg Larsson's to the point way of presenting all the facts one after the other will, without out a doubt, leave the reader open-mouthed at the edge of their seat until the very end. And even though, as this is the last of the three, everything is tied up nicely, with no loose ends so to speak, the reader can't help but crave for more.'s to the point way of presenting all the facts one after the other will, without out a doubt, leave the reader open-mouthed at the edge of their seat until the very end.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|Sometime I like any film that is not talking and just view their performance. The first part (around 30 minute) of this film just show the daily life of WAll-E and the story begin when he meet Eve. He get through alot of obstacle to meet Eve.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|To paraphrase the United States recording industry mega hit, Superlatives are not enough.<br /><br />Roman history, while always fascinating, has always seemed cool and static in North America.  HBO, in \\"Rome\\", has breathed life into well documented time period.  Those who not historically minded, will merely see this as a very well produced HBO drama.  Being hstorically minded, I am thrilled that this period of history can see life.<br /><br />In two seasons, viewers across North America thrilled to the power struggles within the Roman senate played out in venues from Gaul to Rome.  Caesar and his men, in battle and out, realized that the power of plebian popularity. The death of Pompeys' wife, Julia, leads to a struggle for wifery, and eventually his death.  The power play between Mark Anthony, Casesar, Vorenus, Pompey, Cato, and Brutus is fascinating.  Social standing is valued, to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness.  Integrity is merely the price of success. Ambition is the currency of Senate success.<br /><br />The episodes included in the set are:<br /><br />Stolen Eagle<br />How Titus Pullo brought down the republic<br />An Owl in A Thornbush<br />The Ram Has Touched the Wall<br />Egeria<br />Pharsalus<br />Utica Triumph<br />The Spoils<br />Kallends of February<br />Passover<br />Son of Hades<br />These Being the Words<br />Tortoise and the Hare<br />Heroes<br />Phillipi<br />Death Mask<br />Necessary Fiction<br />No God Can Stop A Hungry Man<br />About Your Father<br /><br />Dramatically speaking, this is a stellar production with outstanding performances.  In reading about Rome, I was fascinated that full size sets were constructed for the series accurate to the period.  Full scale models of actual artifacts were used in the production, and that is ambitious.  I can imagine that once season 2 was finished, a museum is now well stocked, and even a Roman style theme park is now fully functional.<br /><br />The bonus features just add more integrity to the series that was overdue, and will be missed.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this series.  It is unfortunate that more episodes were not produced, but I can imagine that the production cost was prohibitive.  Perhaps a Medici period drama might be next...<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta<br /><br />Hail Caesarhat more episodes were not produced, but I can imagine that the production cost was prohibitive.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|I really love this movie. After watching this movie, I feel relax and all stress are gone... :-)
B002PMV9FG|3.0|Being a huge HP fan I was really dissappointed with this entry which basically was the telling of Voldemorts past, which the movie really never showed. Voldemorts parents were never discussed. And where was Bill and Fleur? Where was the battle between the deatheaters and hogwarts at the end(which I was waiting 4 the hole time)? Plus Lupin never married Tonks in this book. Didn't live up to the book at all so it only gets 3 stars from me. I only hope they end the last movie how it's supposed to be done.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Works ok for devices that might need a little boost in volume, but other than that nothing special.<br />It seems to be well made, and works as advertised.<br />Overall a decent product for the price point.

B0009RCPY8|4.0|My daughter and I just did a GHOST BUSTERS double bill in honor of her upcoming move to New York, where she will be working at Columbia University, which is where Bill Murray and his paranomal colleague are studying at the beginning of the first film.  We both really enjoyed the original and felt that it had more than held up over time, but we we were tremendously disappointed with the sequel.  This is a joint review of both films.  We watched the original film on Blu-ray and the second one on regular DVD.  I won't say much more about the format except to say that the quality of the Blu-ray was somewhat disappointing.  In fact, the quality of the DVD was very nearly as good as the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Rewatching the first film, it was fascinating to see what a simple story it told, and how short it was.  There really is very little to the film apart from the simple story and a string of scenes the become a framework for a series of jokes.  The one thing that surprised me was that I don't find Bill Murray's jokes, many of which feel ad libbed, as funny as I did when I saw it when it first came out.  This is balanced by Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd being funnier than I remembered.  The special effects all look pretty good by today's standards, except for Slimer, who didn't much appeal to me when the film came out and still doesn't.  But the highpoint of the movie, then as now, is the Stay-Puft marshmallow man, which is definitely one of the greatest movie monsters ever.<br /><br />I saw the sequel when it came out, but over the years found it odd that I couldn't remember anything about it.  I remembered that Sigourney Weaver's character had a baby, but that was the extent of it.  Rewatching the film it is easy to see why I couldn't remember anything about it:  it is simply not a very memorable film.  The pace and the rhythm are erratic and many of the jokes are simply unfunny.  The plot isn't very interesting and seems pretty formulaic, the formula being the first movie.  It was, in fact, almost a remake of the original with some names changed and situations altered.  Both my daughter and I were very unhappy with it and did not think it a very worthy sequel to the first film.<br /><br />The original 1984 GHOSTBUSTERS still plays like a film that was the product of some imaginations in the grip of a real vision, while the sequel feels like a film made to cash in on the success of the former.

B00008NRI8|4.0|This is a pretty decent romantic comedy. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock create some genuinely funny moments and touching acting. It'll work well for an date with your significant other or if you just want to lift your mood.     Unfortunately, like many such films, this film isn't particularly exciting or original. It begins with the characters hating each other, then being forced into a situation where they work closely together, and then near the end of realizing they love each other. In fact, this movie follows the same narrative arc of Sandra Bullock's other romantic comedies, such as [[ASIN:B002K0WBXW The Proposal]]. It lacks the spunk and freshness of a film like [[ASIN:B0007PLLBU Miss Congeniality]].

B000UD08HW|1.0|I am a huge Dave Gilmour fan but I have never been so disappointed with a Bluray as I am with this one. The video quality is unbelievably poor and Sony should be ashamed that they did not capture this concert properly and the moment is now lost for ever. Do not waste your money getting this on Bluray, just get the DVD.I am so disappointed that I cannot bring myself to watch it right now.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is creepy as hell and beautiful to look at.    Some will enjoy the music, the colors, the lighting, the pacing etc.     Others will enjoy Naomi Watts incredible performance where she has to convey the full spectrum of human emotion.    Think about it...the first part of the movie she plays a perky, naive idealist and by the end of the movie she is equally impressive as a burnt out, suicidal depressive. Anyone who has ever acted can tell you how hard that is to do in the same film.    This is one of Lynch's best films. It is filled with unforgettable scenes (Club Silencio, The audition, The casting meeting with the director and the mobsters).    This is one of those films that will stay in your head.
B0024FAG62|5.0|Start first with two convicts (Glenn and Kline), add in a young gun (Costner)and a black buffalo hunter and slaughter house worker and you have one of the more realistic Westerns ever made. Simply a pleasure to watch and the Kasdan brothers wrote a great script. The blu-ray copy isn't really all that much better than the upconverted \\"Directors Cut\\" DVD and unless you have a blu-ray player and 1080p TV, spend less money and be just as happy.
B00008YJHC|5.0|Listen..I love Surfer and Doolittle as much as the next Pixies Diehard but you know what..Surfer's songs suffer from a \\"sameness\\" due to Albini's production and Doolittle is so heavily front loaded (save for Gouge Away) that the album seriously drags towards the end.    I realize that this is just my opinion but the music on Bossanova is miles ahead of those two albums in terms of musicianship, singing and lyrics.    Bossanova is an album of exquisite beauty and mystery and as a result it is a album that rewards countless number of listenings and still sounds fresh and new every time you play it.    It is probably the Pixies most melodic album (which might be a turn off to some) but it still rocks and I think that this was the album in which the pixies proved how great a band they truly were.      This album features two of the Pixies greatest songs in Velouria and The Happening and in my opinion there is only one so so track ( Stormy Weather) out of the 14 songs on the album.    Once you get to know Bossanova it will become a treasured part of your musical existence.

On a whim I previewed a few of the tracks at Amazon and had the \\"AH-HA!\\" moment. Some artists just translate better live than in the studio and that seems to be the case here. 5 stars. My favorite track is the robert Johnson tune \\"High Water\\"

B001CZVVUU|5.0|What happens when a beautiful soprano singing next to a great tenor? We have a great opera, this conclusion may seem obvious, but not always exceptional singers together make great operas. There has to be chemistry, they must be free to show its full potential. In this version of Manon Massanet have an explosion of elements, all positive, all exciting, all lead to a great show.     Anna Netrebko has been prominent in the opera scene by physical beauty, her stage presence is contagious grown men and women. The dramatic acting, great actress, you know to capture the feeling of the character and express it. The voice of beautiful timbre, lyrical, a little dark, powerful, well designed. A Russian singer has all the elements of a great modern soprano, voice, acting and physical beauty.     Are very comfortable in Manon, ask the French accent, but it goes unnoticed when we hear arias: Adieu, notre petite table or Obéissons, quand leur voix appelle. From naive girl on the way to the convent for the consecration in Paris (Part one emerging unforgettable) and decay in prison. It demonstrated very convincingly by a superb performance. This is a modern singer, that's twenty-first century opera, a union of elements of art. It renews and attracts public.     The Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon follows the same standards of quality, his Le Chevaliers Des Grieux evolves young, naive and full of love for a grown man and bitter. His voice tries to follow the evolution of the character, the lyrical passages does very well in the dramatic pieces missing weight. It works well alongside the protagonist, embodies the character, is comfortable in the role, rather than the previous version with Natalie Dessay in Paris, 2007.     Comprimários The highlights are: Christof Fischesser makes Le Comte des Grieux, paper down voluminous voice. He is too young, just remember the father of the protagonist and his voice is more baritone that down. The Lescaut Afredo Dasa baritone voice is clear withgood musicianship and performance.     Daniel Baremboin is a fashionable pianist and conductor of world renown, is governed by orchestras all over the world. I always thought it better on the piano. In Berlin Staatskapelle baton of their time are too slow, perhaps to help the singers to interpret, but no breath! But that makes the reading of the work monotonous, sometimes tiring, arias that excite the public are little applause. Loses to music, get the theater.     The direction of Vincent Paterson captures the essence of the work of Massanet, does not sit, modernizes the reading. Carries the work to Paris for 50 years, with train arriving Manon, parties at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and the grace of Hotel Transilvania are dynamic elements. Explores the dramatic potential of the singers, move them without exaggeration. The perfect light, help and encourage, directors this time is understood, had the same design. Costumes consistent with the time chosen, flawless, perfect finish, in the city carry light from the 50's. This opera is introducing a new variable, makeup, never seen work so well executed. Choir or are impeccably costumed actors, with the advent of high definition make-up gave a leap.     Comparing the first Manon I attended with Edita Gruberova letter of 1983 in Vienna with the newly released Netrebko, there is an evolution, such as opera recordings have changed in those 25 years. The opera is theater that corner, the VHS are in high definition DVD, the productions are infinitely more whimsical, resemble a large theater or Broadway productions. We have interviews with actors and directors, choice of chapters and a booklet with the article and summary of the opera, all in English of course.     Vocally I prefer with Manon Gruberova or with Beverly Sills in 1977 in New York City Opera. The Manon of Netrebko and Villazon back a new language, modern, current, charismatic. In the era of Internet, digital music, speed, use disposable, opera seems an aberration. But she finds a way, renewing the public and will always be reborn as Phoenix.             Paris é uma Festa !     O que acontece quando um belo soprano canta ao lado de um grande tenor? Temos uma grande ópera, essa conclusão pode parecer óbvia, mas nem sempre excepcionais cantores juntos fazem grandes óperas. Tem que haver química, eles tem que estar à vontade para mostrar todo o potencial. Nessa versão da Manon de Massanet temos uma explosão de elementos, todos positivos, todos empolgantes, todos levam a um grande espetáculo.     Anna Netrebko tem se destacado no cenário lírico pela beleza física, sua presença no palco contagia marmanjos e senhoras. Pela atuação dramática, grande atriz, sabe captar o sentimento do personagem e expressá-lo. Pela voz, de timbre belo, lírico, um pouco escuro, potente, bem projetado. A cantora russa tem todos os elementos de um grande soprano moderno, voz, atuação e beleza física.     Está muito a vontade em Manon, peca no sotaque francês, mas isso passa despercebido quando ouvimos suas árias: Adieu,notre petite table ou Obéissons , quand leur voix appelle. De menina ingênua a caminho do convento para a consagração em Paris (Faz uma emergente inesquecível) e a decadência na prisão. Tudo demonstrado com muita convicção através de uma atuação soberba. Isso é uma cantora moderna, isso é ópera do século XXI, uma união de elementos da arte. Isso renova e atrai publico.     O tenor mexicano Rolando Villazón segue o mesmo padrão de qualidade, seu Le Chevaliers Des Grieux evolui de jovem, ingênuo e cheio de amor para um homem maduro e amargurado. Sua voz tenta acompanhar a evolução do personagem, nas passagens líricas se sai muito bem, nas partes dramáticas falta peso. Atua bem ao lado da protagonista, incorpora o personagem, está a vontade no papel, melhor que na versão anterior com Natalie Dessay em Paris , 2007.     Os comprimários de destaque são: Christof Fischesser faz Le Comte des Grieux , papel para baixo de voz encorpada. Ele é jovem demais, pouco lembra o pai do protagonista e sua voz está mais para barítono que para baixo. O Lescaut de Afredo Dasa é barítono de voz clara com boa musicalidade e atuação.     Daniel Baremboin é um badalado pianista e maestro de renome mundial, rege orquestras pelos quatro cantos do mundo. Sempre achei ele melhor no piano. Na batuta da Staatskapelle Berlim seus tempos são excessivamente lentos, talvez seja para ajudar os cantores a interpretarem, senão haja fôlego! Mas isso torna a leitura da obra monótona, as vezes cansativa, árias que empolgam o publico são pouco ovacionadas. Perde a música, ganha o teatro.     A direção de Vincent Paterson capta a essência da obra de Massanet, não se acomoda, moderniza a leitura. Transporta a obra para a Paris dos anos 50, trem chegando com Manon, festas aos pés da Torre Eifel e a graça do Hotel Transilvania são elementos dinâmicos . Explora o potencial dramático dos cantores, movimenta-os sem exageros. A luz perfeita, ajuda e estimula, diretores dessa vez se entenderam, tiveram a mesma concepção. Figurinos condizentes com a época escolhida, impecáveis, perfeitos no acabamento, nos transportam a cidade luz da década de 50. Essa ópera inaugura um novo quesito, maquiagem, nunca vi trabalho tão bem executado. Coristas ou protagonistas estão impecavelmente maquiados, com o advento da alta definição a maquiagem deu um salto qualitativo.     Comparando a primeira Manon que assisti com Edita Gruberova datada do ano de 1983 em Viena com a recém lançada da Netrebko, existe uma evolução, como as gravações de ópera mudaram nesses 25 anos. A ópera é mais teatro que canto, do VHS estamos no DVD de alta definição, as produções são infinitamente mais caprichadas, lembram grandes peças de teatro ou produções da Brodway. Temos entrevistas com os protagonistas e diretores, escolha de capítulos e um encarte com artigo e resumo da ópera,tudo em inglês é claro.     Vocalmente prefiro a Manon com a Gruberova ou com Beverly Sills em 1977 na New York City Opera. A Manon da Netrebko e do Villazon trás uma nova linguagem , moderna, atual, carismática. Na era da internet, da música digital, da velocidade, do consumo descartável, ópera parece uma aberração. Mas ela encontra um caminho, renova o público e como Fênix sempre renasce.

B000DN5W4I|5.0|Really enjoyed this DVD and will be watching it many times over.  Even though the camera work is kind of choppy here and there throughout this DVD the music for me over shadows that aspect on the whole.  It is always about the music bottom line.  Joe Bonamassa is truly one of the great blues / rock guitar players of our time and his band mates really step up to the plate and go toe to toe accompanying his playing.  Joe Bonamassa has great tone, touch and blues feeling which makes his playing shine over so many other players out there today.  His energy and guitar chops along with his singing are very impressive.  If you like good blues and rockin' music played by a trio band you can't go wrong with this DVD concert at Rockpalast.
032147404X|5.0|Straight-shooting, easy to read, no holds barred writing.  Fits my needs, interests and attention span.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|this album is awesome. I really have no complaints about Slayer. they are a legendary band that has influenced a ton of thrash and death metal bands. the songs are fast, the solos are crazy, and the vocals are even more crazier. I would have to say, from all the reviews that I have read on this album, that the star song is \\"Psychopathy Red\\", which is a song about Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. if this is Slayer's last album, they deserve a good retirement. from the time I started listening to them until now, I have never heard a \\"mellow\\" song yet. good job Slayer!
B000MRA5NS|4.0|This is a great movie with good sound.  However, I feel it does not stand up to The World is not Enough or Quantum of Solice when it comes to the surround sound effects.  Hence I give it 4 stars.  Still a very good movie while the others above I feel are GREAT Movies.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|We were so excited to receive Mama Mia! but were very disappointed when it skipped. Will not purchase from this seller again!
B00005Q45W|1.0|I was disappointed--felt like every song sounded the same & the cd is a bit depressing overall.  Taken individually there are some great lyrics & some interesting music.  This seems like a cd for shuffle mode, not one for a long car ride!
B002NXQ0X8|5.0|This CD was the 'CD deal of the day' awhile back, so I got it. And I wasn't really expecting much. But then I listened to the album and it just blew me away. It's surprisingly very good. It's not super long. Both of the artists voices work very well together. I really enjoy it. Definitely one of my most listened to CDs right now. Totally worth buying. A couple of my favorite tracks are Relator, Wear and Tear, and I Don't Know What To Do.
B000KC5350|4.0|Overall I'm happy with the mount, this was a replacement for the original that came with my Garmin after the pin kept falling out. This one seems to be much better built. I travel a lot and wouldn't be caught dead without my GPS and this mount.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is my all-time favorite BBC production, and I've seen a lot of them. The acting is superb and rendered in such a way that each character is believable and relevant. It seems that the production has been closely faithful to the book. My husband and I would like to live in Lark Rise and have a job in Candleford - much like Laura.     We hope more seasons of this production are forthcoming. It has become a staple of our entertainment library.    duo banjolin
B001KZVQJI|5.0|WOW!  I cannot say enough good things about Peter Jackson's take on Kong.  Video and audio are spot-on - check out the scenes aboard the Venture for detail, contrast is not too hot and the color range captures the lighting temperature of the times.  Noticed some very minor banding during the foggy rock crash scene, but it was fleeting and not disconcerting.  Audio is excellent, you can almost make out Kong's growling coming out of the back of his throat, and the sound of the airplanes zooming around the Empire State Building gave my surround a good workout.  I heartily recommend this movie to everyone!
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|I am not a movie critic.  I just know if I like a movie and if it entertains me.  I liked this movie and it did entertain me.  For those of you who like detailed reviews on movies, I realize this will not help you.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|let me just start by saying i love almost every pixar movie(except cars). when i heard this was coming out i had to see it, and i rarely go to the theaters. im glad i did and in 3d. i smiled, laughed, almost wept some tears for the old man. now that i got this on blu ray ive watched it twice and it showed up on my door yesterday! this is an awesome movie and if you dont like it..... i dont think we can be friends. thanks russel and mr. fredericksen      oh kevin and dug too.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Okay, to all those die hard Trek fans who didn't like the new movie, Boo to you.  I have loved Star Trek since I could watch Sci fi.  By the time I was old enough to watch Star Trek they were all reruns and I fell in love it.  I was so happy to see it on the big screen, (although the first movie bored me to tears) and watched all the various series on t.v.  The movies were great but they seemed to be losing steam and not gaining any new fans.  I applaud J.J. Abrams for breathing new life into my old love.  By creating an alternate timeline the new movies have no limits.  I see this as genius. The old time line is safe for the die hard fans, but it gives those of us die hard fans with open minds (and the new fans the movie managed to snag by being such a great movie) a new franchise!  There are no constrictions!  Everything can be new.  I am anxiously awaiting the next installment!  Excellent casting. Excellent writing. Excellent acting.  Excellent movie!
B002AWJEU8|4.0|I ordered this music dvd along with several others. So far this is the best of bunch.I am a long time musician and sound tech,not a guitar player so I was not expecting to be captured by the depth of this concert.I know of Steve Vai's history and work but,his band is amazing as well. Powerful drumming, two violins with two guitarist, keyboards and bass.The songs are very interesting arrangements that showcase the tremendous talent and technical prowess of these excellent players.Even if you have never heard of Vai, this show pulls you in. Watch the bios first.Then when watching the concert you will enjoy it fully.I have a large collection of music dvds from many diverse artists,This one is in my top 5..
B000KZMU30|5.0|I will have to disagree with the last review.  This is a very attractive 3LP set and on UK virgin vinyl.  It looks great and more importantly, it sounds great!  Yes I actually have played mine.  If you can get a hold of this set take good care of it and keep it!
0307266303|5.0|I cannot state anything about the greatness of this book that haven't already been said here before by hundreds of reviewers. Still I fell I must add my voice, just to make it completely clear how amazing this book is. Not only is it exciting and well written, it contains tons of information ranging from ancient human history to modern day ultra running. It even contains hints on how you can become a better runner (by following the [[ASIN:B000A7GEGW Evolution]], [[ASIN:1416549447 Chi]] or [[ASIN:0972553762 Pose]] running techniques). This book helped me realize that going minimal (and eventual barefoot) is necessary in order to stay injury free. Most importantly I have regained that innocent childish love of running by focusing on an easy, light and smooth stride and above all remembering to have fun.<br /><br />Enough said, just read it.
B001U5V04O|5.0|This is the most completely satisfying video production of Don Giovanni I have encountered to date.  Allow me first to assuage concerns regarding the sound on this Blu-Ray disc -- succinctly put, the LPCM 5.1 sound is impeccable.  The singing, acting, conducting, design, stage direction, and video direction converge ideally with each other to create a jewel of operatic performance.  The result is an as near perfect production of Don Giovanni as I have ever seen (N.B.  The search for such a well-balanced production of Don Giovanni, either in live performance in opera houses around the world or in video productions from film to Beta to VHS to Laserdisc to DVD, has been the \\"Holy Grail\\" of my opera enjoyment for the past thirty years.  I believe I have found it.)  I am heartened to think that this production on Blu-Ray may provide newcomers to Mozart and opera in general with an elegant and superb introduction to both the composer and the medium.
0061914177|5.0|A very well writen book by Gary Vaynerchuk... Its like he is in the room and talking to you... Showing you how he made money on line and its never to late for you...

B000A0GP0Y|2.0|There were just too many holes in the movie that prevented me from giving this a 4 star review. I would say that some of the acting was \\"entertaining\\", but I can just go on and on on the holes in believe-ability, which usually ruin it for me (yes, even though it's a movie!). The believe-ability has to be taken into context, of course (ie-sciene fiction or superhero movies need to be taken in that context)..but this was supposed to a regular sports drama on this planet anyway, right? Here are just SOME of the parts that made me throw popcorn at the movie:  -Car chase scene is in downtown Long Beach (clearly with the convention center and Gameworks arcade in the back), but the cop cars say \\"San Diego Police\\".  -There were a few scenes where the prisoners sneak into prohibited areas of the prison to break into the computer system or medical records....oh please...is it that easy??  -If Crewe (Sandler) didn't really have an incentive to win from the start (his incentive was to just set up a team to lose to the guards) then why would he go out of his way to recruit such talented players and even risk physical harm to get them to join the team (ie- playing b-ball with Deacon)  -So, there are a group of tranvestite gay prisoners just prancing around in prison now?? And they get their own chearleader outfits and get to cheer at the game??? Come on~~ Tracy Morgan could have been better used as a player/prisoner in this movie than as a gay cheerleader...the whole gay cheerleaders portion was actually not necessary to the storyline development at all...and not realistic.  -The scene where the guards take Crewe out to talk to the warden while he's playing golf with his important friends doesn't make sense. So, they would actually escort a prisoner out to the golf course just because he wanted to talk to the warden about the game? Couldn't they just have told him to wait until the warden returned? It wasn't that urgent.  -If the referees were \\"on the payroll\\", then why didn't they do anything when Crewe kept hitting that one ref in the balls?? And why would they call touchdown on the last play when it was questionable he was out of bounds?  -The prisoner commentator that was put next to Berman (whatever his name is from ESPN) was absolutely unnecessary and not even funny...like they would actually put somebody like that who doesn't even talk as a co-commentator...ok...  -They mentioned Nate Scarsborough (Burt Reynolds) didn't play football since 1955....hm...that would make him about 72? And he would still be willing to run the ball on that one play and get hit in mid-air like that? This isn't \\"Rocky Balboa\\" guys.  -And worst of all...I know Adam Sandler produced the movie, but why you use HIM? He doesn't look athletic or strong like a quarterback and he's far from handsome, which the character is supposed to be.  There are other holes that insulted me as a viewer, but if you can get beyond many of them and just enjoy some of the funny acting...then it might be decent...but definitely not worth more than 3 stars.  They had a good basic storyline, but just some of the details that were put in (either for humor or lack of common-sense of the real world) just ruined it for me.
B0024HH32A|5.0|\\"I have just left your fighting sons in Korea. They have done their best there, and I can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way.<br />I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty. Goodbye\\" -- Gen. Douglas MacArthur<br /><br />This is the Korean War (1950-1953). We are visiting and passionate on the front line and observing the many lives of the very people that make the M*A*S*H (The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit possible. This film is touted as a thinly veiled Vietnam War satire.<br /><br />Some great one-liners as \\"You forgot your shingle doctor \\"as he holds up a piece of toast with creamed chipped beef on it. Or as Frank Burns is being hauled off in a straight jacket, the loud speaker is playing \\"it's time to say sayonara\\" May military inside jokes and even the clich&eacute;s have a basis in reality.  Although this film takes place, in Korea, it draws a very close parallel to the environment I was in Vietnam and I suspect there have been other wars with other environments similar and may again in the future. It's the laughs that we clean out of these types of films that make those situations tolerable.<br /><br />For many movies especially older ones Blu-Ray is really just a gimmick and does not really add to or subtract from the storyline or the acting itself. However occasionally the visuals and sounds of Blu-Ray can contribute to earlier movies that were designed before Blu-Ray was conceived; this is one of those movies.  This review may be under a different version but it is for the Blu-ray version so be sure to listen to the commentary by the late Robert Altman, AMC Back history, Enlisted: The story of M*A*S*H, M*A*S*H: History Through the Lens, Remembering M*A*S*H: 30th anniversary, Theatrical Trailer, Portuguese Trailer, and Still Gallery.<br /><br />Through early morning fog I see<br />The visions of the things to be.<br />The pains that are withheld for me<br />I realize, and I can see.....<br /><br />That suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />The game of life is hard to play<br />I'm gonna lose it anyway<br />The losing card, I'll someday lay<br />So this is all I have to say<br /><br />Suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />The sword of time will pierce our skin<br />It doesn't hurt when it begins<br />But as it works its way on in<br />The pain grows stronger, watch it brim..<br /><br />Suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />A brave man once requested me<br />To answer questions that are key<br />\\"Is it to be, or not to be?\\"<br />And I replied, \\"why ask me?\\"<br /><br />But suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />And you can do the same thing if you please<br /><br />If you enjoyed this and other Robert Altman films you may like a more esoteric film by Robert Altman called Quintet ((1979).<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JOR8 Quintet ~ Paul Newman]]he pains that are withheld for me<br />I realize, and I can see.....<br /><br />That suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />The game of life is hard to play<br />I'm gonna lose it anyway<br />The losing card, I'll someday lay<br />So this is all I have to say<br /><br />Suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />The sword of time will pierce our skin<br />It doesn't hurt when it begins<br />But as it works its way on in<br />The pain grows stronger, watch it brim..<br /><br />Suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />A brave man once requested me<br />To answer questions that are key<br />\\"Is it to be, or not to be?\\"<br />And I replied, \\"why ask me?\\"<br /><br />But suicide is painless<br />It brings on many changes<br />And I can take or leave it if I please<br /><br />And you can do the same thing if you please<br /><br />If you enjoyed this and other Robert Altman films you may like a more esoteric film by Robert Altman called Quintet ((1979).<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JOR8 Quintet ~ Paul Newman]]
B002M9WW30|5.0|These people complaining about the price being wrong or whatever dumb idiot nonsense they are rambling about has absolutely NOTHING to do with Rocky on Blu-Ray. They need to be removed ASAP. This is great i have always loved the rocky movies probably because of some of my own insecurities in my life and its the only underdog movie that i enjoy. I've never  been a fan of the comeback, we can do it, football, or Finding Forester, Rudy type movies, but Stallone has always managed to make you feel what he's going through in all off the movies, even if some of them are a little forced and something you've seen in the others. The quality is great, i mean its not like todays filmed in 1080p films like Transformers, or computer animated stuff like today. But who cares its just rocky:) The copies i had which i copied from DVDs from the local video store don't really stand the test of time, and this is an excellent way to preserve them for the future. This along with other classic films deserve to be restored to the best technology has to offer. Heres a list of the Rockys as i like them. And some others i can't wait to see on blu ray.    Rocky III-I was 1 when the first came out, so this is the first one i was exposed to with \\"Pity the Fool\\" Mr T. Man he should have gotten an oscar!! lol  Rocky I- Of course it started it all, i just never really saw it much when i was younger.  Rocky V- For some reason i really liked this one, because he went back old school, and actually DID street fighting, great scenes in the end, i had saw the others already but got really pumped with this one(odd i know).  Rocky IV- Good, low budget compared to the others, Russian, Dulph Lungdren was a bit enhh so so. Good songs in it though.  Rocky II- for some reason i couldnt get myself to highly enjoy this one till the end, to much of Rocky being down, and doing commercials, but very classic acting by the legendary Burgess Meredith(RIP).  Rocky Balboa- Kudos to Stallone who was more ripped at 61 in this movie than he's ever been in his life, was great but waiting nearly 17 years i thought was a bit of a mistake, still touching though, in that Rocky sort of fashion HA.    More titles to look forward to on blu ray    1. Jurassic Parks-GRRR Hurry up Steven  2. Indiana Jones-Again HURRY UP STEVEN!!  3. Aliens-Hurry up James Cameron, Ridley Scott, David Fincher and whoever made the other one.  4. War Of The Worlds-Should have been hear already.  5. The Abyss- Strange but i loved this one.  6. Star Wars-Coughs George(old ones i could care less about the new ones)  7. The Core- Most hated it, i dug it, corny but some cool effects.  8. Lord Of the Rings- I\\"M NOT SETTLING FOR THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IN DECEMBER!! I'll wait.  9. Yep i sure did forget..oops...Back to the Future Trilogy--Come on Robert Zemekis and Stephen!  10. Also i love the two Grudge movies, i have the first, second hasn't come out yet, steet clear of 3!  11. Also the Ring, even the second one isnt half bad.    Not gonna sit and rack my brain, but there are others, so back to Rocky, if your a fan, and you want these classics on Blu Ray with a great quality picture an sound, and lots of bonus features, pick it up.    BTW-Amazon people, go to your local wal mart unless you live in a cave and pick it up for just 54 bucks plus tax. I rarely order anything, and you should probably guess if it says 49.99 on here and its cheaper than wally world that its a mistake, be more careful next time. Or just get up of your rears and drive to the stores! Everyone else, peace, enjoy the BOXING!
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Compositionally, I didn't find \\"The Whirlwind\\" as compelling as the first two releases, but the sound and performance is still unmistakably Transatlantic, and look at what I am comparing this to. This is five star material when compared to any other prog today. It is hard to describe how well the genius of these prog-masters comes through to the listener.    The 'bonus' disc tracks are all great. The covers are stunningly great, especially 'Hogweed' and 'Salty Dog'; the original material is far better than the expected 'B-side' quality you might expect from a bonus disc.    Overall, I just cannot give this any less than 5 stars. Transatlantic, please don't make everyone wait so long for the next one, ok?
B0029O08WA|3.0|This soundtrack is decent, but it doesn't compare to the soundtrack for \\"Twilight\\". I absolutely love every song on \\"Twilight\\" but unfortunately I can't say the same for this CD.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|She really is deserving of better than this sort of frantic comedy; so are all of us.  Too contrived, too forced, too everything.      Cyndy K.
B002V0WN2K|1.0|As a fan of Bon Jovi's for 20 plus years, I figured I would ALWAYS buy their albums. The time has come to now hold off and wait until they hit the bargain bin. I really liked all the albums up till CRUSH. I thought it had a lot of filler, and not a lot of great songs. Bounce was about the same except the top songs on that CD didn't match It's My Life or One Wild Night. Have a Nice Day, however, restored my faith in Bon Jovi a little. Other than Wildflower and Bells of Freedom, I love the CD. Great rocking CD. Lost Highway, to me, is a good CD. Mellower, but that is what they wanted. However, they promised a big ROCK record with THE CIRCLE, and they failed miserably. The first single came out, WE WEREN'T BORN TO FOLLOW, and it sounded like a retread. A leftover song. After a few listens, it grew on me a little so I decided to go into the CD with an open mind. I have had it for awhile now and  can now say it stinks. The 2nd best song on here starts off with the same beat and sound of Livin on a Prayer. It is like they ran out of ideas, and threw leftover junk together. They should have taken a longer break.   I have purchased all their CDs and even CD singles. I have spent A LOT of money on them thru eBAY, Amazon, etc.. And wanted to like this, but I just can't.       However, if you want a LOUD ROCK record then try WINGER's KARMA. I never really liked Winger. I enjoyed a few of their songs but never was a big fan. BUT, their new release KARMA absolutely kills this CD. If you want a good, LOUD, Rock record, buy KARMA. It seems that Jon and Richie were right when they promised a BIG, LOUD ROCK record would come out. But they didnt release it, Winger did. Karma is the best CD of the year, by far! Buy it and stay AWAY from THE CIRCLE.
0307716988|4.0|This book was very informative and an emotional experience for me. The illustrations and written information was excellent. I learned so much about Michael Jackson after reading it.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|As everyone else has said, these triggers are great.  The install in about 2 seconds, and stay put.  I played the PS3 briefly without these, and the R2/L2 buttons were not the easiest things to use.  Once installed they make life much easier, Sony would be wise to build these into future controllers.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|First of all, I had not even seen the movie before I purchased the Blu-Ray set, but knew I wanted to own it due to everything I had heard.  I read all of the 1 star reviews, and not one of them complains that the movie is bad, but that somehow Disney ripped them off by charging too much...hmmm, they must be kidding because there are many places (large retail stores, large electronic stores, etc.) where the 4 disc Blu-Ray set can be picked up for about $20.  Okay, I had to make that point, no onto the review.  I have a 3 year old, so we still buy a lot of DVDs and don't waste money on Blu-Ray purchases, but do rent them on occasion.  I can tell you I was blown away with the vivid colors in this film on Blu-Ray, it is simply AMAZING!  The best scene for viewing on Blu-Ray is when the house first leaves ground and all of the balloons appear. all I can say is WOW.  I have a Sony Blu-Ray and 58\\" Panasonic Viera Plasma, and it is just beautiful to watch.  I haven't even bothered to watch the DVD copy, yet, I plan to put that in the car for my daughter.  Now the movie is a wonderful tale of heartbreak, joy, self-triumph, understanding and just a great depiction of life in general through our main character.  The talking dogs are great as well.  I highly recommend you pick this \\"UP.\\"  For the current price on Amazon of $19.99, why not. You get the Blu-Ray movie, Blu-Ray extras, DVD and Digital Copy, I think that is a great price.  All the reviews of the movie is why I wanted to buy it instead of rent and I'm glad it is in my collection.  Enjoy!
B002IYEQR4|1.0|The rating is for the price increase only.  I think it is a great movie.    Like another reviewer here, I to was going to buy this version of the movie when it became available.  Due to the huge price increase as soon as it became available, I am also passing on purchasing it.  Maybe in a month or so, it will come down to a reasonable price.    SORRY AMAZON but it is just not fair.
0385504225|1.0|After reading A&D and DaVinci I preordered this book...wish I had waited and read the reviews...a lot more entertaining...and I wouldn't have wasted the time it took to plow through this book.  What a disappointment.
0756405890|5.0|An excellent novel of intriguing tales told from an interesting perspective.  Easily one of the best books I have ever read, and I make this claim as someone who reads several books weekly.  It is obvious from the prose that Rothfuss has taken the time to develope his story and properly present it to us, the voracious readers.  Highly recommend.
0596007124|4.0|First, this is a Design Patterns book which takes a different approach to teaching ideas from the original GOF book, [[ASIN:0201633612 Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]].    Although I never read the original book, I looked at it enough times to know that it would be a difficult read.  That book is a better reference book after you've read the Head First book to learn the concepts.    What I really like about this book is the emphasis on helping the reader to learn and understand the material.  Head First Labs put serious thought into how people learn and they apply this knowledge to existing topics like Design Patterns.    Most of the code examples were in JAVA but they are simple enough to translate to C# without any trouble.  There are a few design patterns, such as the iterator pattern, that can be accomplished in C# in a better way (ie. yield statement).  I still found it helpful to know the iterator pattern by name and what it solves so I really understand what the yield statement does.  So learn the concepts but expect to apply them in C# differently.
B002B5Q4T8|4.0|William Inge's evocative portrait of small-town life, PICNIC, features the blazing star combo of Kim Novak and William Holden.<br /><br />When handsome drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) decides to drop in and visit old college buddy Alan Benson (Cliff Robertson) in his small Kansas town, he ends up turning the head of Alan's girlfriend Madge (Kim Novak) and disrupting the peaceful lives of her extended family. The action comes to a climax at the Labour Day picnic, where Madge is to be crowned. As Madge comes to grips with her uncontrollable attraction to Hal; spinsterish schoolmarm Rosemary (Rosalind Russell) conspires to get her long-standing beau Howard (Arthur O'Connell) down the aisle via the shortest possible means.<br /><br />Kim Novak is brilliant as Madge, the young woman torn between the man who can offer financial security, and the penniless drifter who excites her like no-one she's ever met before; Novak plays the conflict of emotions very well. In 1955, William Holden was a little too seasoned to play the muscly stud, but offers a fine performance as Hal. Susan Strasberg, as little sister Millie, provides lots of depth with a role that's written as a caricature (the brainy younger sibling marching around in glasses and bluejeans, reading \\"dirty books\\"), yet Strasberg plays the role believably. Rosalind Russell shines in the role of schoolmarm Rosemary, desperate to marry and leave her rented room (though her performance is quite hammy and broad in some of the scenes). Betty Field and Verna Felton also provide solid work, albeit in thankless supporting roles.<br /><br />Although the CinemaScope visuals take some of the impact away from the claustrophobic view of small-town life that's being depicted in the story, the wide ratio displays Kim Novak to her utmost advantage (not to mention William Holden, who sheds his shirt in several scenes). George Duning supplies the evocative incidental and jazz score, which features \\"Moonglow\\" in the Labour Day dance segment.<br /><br />In the tradition of \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\", \\"Bus Stop\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\", PICNIC is a searing romantic drama you're sure to fall in love with.radition of \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\", \\"Bus Stop\\" and \\"Suddenly Last Summer\\", PICNIC is a searing romantic drama you're sure to fall in love with.
6305090564|5.0|An entertaining B-movie and a sign of things to come from director Sommers.  Fast-paced, good performances from Treat Williams, Wes Studi, and, of course, the always beautiful Famke Janssen.  Maybe not as good something like TREMORS, it does have that kind of feel and is a good ride.  Don't look for more and you won't be disappointed.  Is is just me or is Kevin J. O' Connor the human equivalent of finger nails on a blackboard?
B002C6K7NA|5.0|I grew up with Lynyrd Skynyrd and am so happy they haven't hung up their guitars. This CD is rockin! Favorite tracks- God & Guns, Floyd, and Unbroken. Of the 12 tracks, 5 are super, 5 are strong, and 2 aren't bad but they're growing on me with repeated listening. I'm glad I bought this CD!! Having said that, I have to confess that I am not a critic or an expert, just someone who loves music and enjoys a solid effort and this CD hits the mark for me.<br /><br />I recommend this CD, just get insurance on your sound system, you'll blow your speakers with God & Guns!
B002JODV3S|4.0|I can't say I am a Steve Vai follower, but do know he is one the great guitar players alive today. I saw this concert distributed on BluRay and went for it. The video looks great. I was disappointed that they did not release it in one of the BluRay lossless audio formats (e.g., DTS-HD MA). The audio is still the DD-5.1, as distributed on the DVD version. Nontheless, it still is a good sounding audio track.    I like Steve Vai's sense of humour. He seems like a really decent guy. And he truly appears to appreciate his audience. He knows he is good, and his 'posing' at times can be annoying. But heck, he has paid his dues. He can do want he wants. Besides, it's his show.     Overall, this is a great concert for musicians in the audience, especially the guitar players. I like it and recommend to others. What I liked the least is that I did find the music somewhat repetitious after awhile. There is a lot of speed licks, heavy whammy bar, and screaming feedback. Its exciting, but can grow a bit old. But Steve is one of the masters at this, and this concert is recorded and produced really well. As an extra treat, check out the bonus section where he sells his custom distortion pedal. It is really well done.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Let everybody tell you the details of Mark Knopfler's style.  I'm new to him, this being only my second CD of his, first being \\"Get Lucky.\\"  That became my bedtime lullabye album and I needed this one to keep from wearing the first out.  This is just as good, getting me into that late-night mood.    So, I know many  folks look at the intricacies of the perfomance; in this case, I just appreciate the effect it has on me.  Isn't this a purpose of music?  The guy is just darn pleasant to listen to.    By the way, let me  note  that I got this from Innuendo at a good price, in top (new) condition and shipping almost as quick as Prime.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar movies are like kids and parents.  You love 'em all.  But Up has a wonderful moral that sets it apart.    Carl Fredrickson is a curmudgeonly 78 year old widower weighed down by a broken promise made to his deceased wife Ellie when they were children to take her to the faraway Paradise Falls discovered by their hero, explorer Charles Muntz, in a baloon.      If there has ever been a character like Ellie in cinema, I've never seen her.  An adventurous tomboy that grows up into a lovely young lady and loving wife to Carl.  It's impossible not to fall in love with her.  And though most of her time onscreen is a wordless montage of her life with Carl at the beginning of the film, you'll miss her the rest of the movie, just as Carl does.    When commercial development forces him out of his shell following Ellie's death, Carl keeps his promise to Ellie, taking off in their home, lifted by thousands of helium-filled baloons to South America and Paradise Falls.  Along the way, an inconvienent stoway--a fellow wounded soul, 8 year old boy-scout Russell--inadvertantly teaches Carl (with the help of a wonderful message left by Ellie) the wonderful, life affirming lesson that what matters in life is having each other.  Russell draws the fun Carl out of curmudgeonly Carl, and you can see the man Ellie fell in love with, and understand why she considered her life with him all she ever needed.      Amazingly, the movie itself tracks this theme.  Though it's all entertaining, and has its excitement, what you'll remember most is the montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the time Carl and Russell spend together, respectively filling the holes in their lives left by loved ones.    Dog lovers will appreciate Dug, a dog that Carl and Russell meet along the way that can talk with the aid of a specialized collar. Any dog owner that's ever wondered what their persistently happy (albeit easily distracted--Squirrel!!) dog is thinking will thank Pixar for explaining.    Kids willlove it, but it's adults that will (hopefully) get the message.    The Blu Ray 4 disc edition contains some extras:    Partly Cloudy--Everyone knows where babies come from...storks!  Partly Cloudy explains where storks get them.    A \\"Dug\\" Short--Wouldn't have fit in the movie, but I'm glad it's on the DVD.    Both of these are on the regular edition of the DVD, but Up should be seen in Blu Ray.    There's a nice backstory to the Married Life montage of Carl and Ellie's life together.  It's interesting to see what made it and didn't make it from the original storyboards.  Maybe I was prejudiced by the movie, because I saw it first, but I'm glad the evolution of ideas led Pixar to what's in the film.

0553277472|5.0|I first read this masterpiece of fiction when I was fifteen, I remember clearly it was 1980 and I spent days in my room trying to understand the big words and attempting to figure out all the characters Pirsig would reference, Kant, Hume, Poincare, and the ancient Greeks.  Since we were well before a simple Wikipedia search, it would be years before I would hear most of their names again.  What I do remember very clearly is that when I emerged from my room I knew I was going to college to become a Mechanical Engineer.  I had long since forgotten why I came to that conclusion until I relived my young experience on page 176 just a few days ago.  It was my third reading of this great book.<br /><br />My second reading came in 1992, I was 28.  In those days I was brash, arrogant, and full of gumption, as Pirsig would call it.  I knew a lot more about philosophy and theology and engineering then I did my first time through.  I also owned a motorcycle and had completed an active duty tour in the military.  I was working as a systems engineer for the DoD and was in school working on my second Master's degree.  The book still made sense... a lot of sense.  At that point I knew it had nothing to do with Zen and even less to do with motorcycle maintenance, but Pirsig has always told us that up front.<br /><br />Fast forward sixteen years...a family, a company, a new career, a fresh read.  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is still every bit the masterpiece it was back in 1974.  But then what is it about - if it's not about Zen or art of motorcycle maintenance?  Certainly much has been written over the past four decades attempting to define exactly what Pirsig was trying to tell us.  No need for that.  Read the book, Pirsig will tell you.  No matter what you may hear, no matter what you may think, this book defines for us that which can never be expressed through words and rational thought alone.  It must be experienced.  Experience is the life changer, not thoughts or deeds.  Experience this book and understand why.nce this book and understand why.

1595141979|5.0|Ordinarily, I wouldn't recommend skipping books in a series.  Especially by the third book, there may be too much background info to catch up on.  However, this book has enough exposition in it, the author seems determined to bring everyone up to speed and rope in new readers with this later addition if necessary.  I think readers will enjoy the first two books of Vampire Academy, but if you are looking for some resolution to the romantic conflict and a dramatic cliffhanger ending, you'd do fine to go directly to this book without reading the others first.<br /><br />There are three kinds of vampires: Moroi, dhampir, and Strigoi.  Moroi are wealthy magic-wielders. Dhampirs are half-human, half-vampire, possessed of unusual strength. They can only bear children by Moroi, and their offspring will always be dhampir. Most male dhampirs swear fealty to a particular Morai and protect them as bodyguards. Many female dhampirs take on work as \\"blood whores\\" trading sexual services, and donating blood to Moroi for the high that it gives them. Dhampirs are treated by their Moroi counterparts as trusted servants as best, and second class citizens at worst. (I think it's quite telling that dhampir is not capitalized, but the other two are.)  Finally, the Strigoi are former Moroi who have gone to the dark side. They are immortal, they enjoy killing humans, harassing Moroi, and are recognizable by their pale skin and red-rimmed eyes.  Moroi and dhampir attend prep school St. Vladimir's to learn how to defend themselves against Strigoi.<br /><br />The class tensions inherent in vampire society are finally beginning to bust apart at the seams. Once again, dhampir Rose is torn between love and duty as she struggles to keep her growing feelings for her tutor Dimitri under wraps as she protects her Moroi friend Lissa from Moroi attacks.  Rose has already earned two molnija marks (the Russian word for lightning) on the back of her neck for killing Strigoi.  This book includes a huge battle scene, which earns her a molnija star tattoo meaning she's killed too many Strigoi to count.<br /><br />The end of the book brings plenty of tension and excitement. As graduation nears, Rose has begun seeing ghosts. She does have a love scene with Dimitri but almost immediately loses him to a Strigoi attack brought on by some foolish underclassmen, intent on hazing new members of their secret club. Christian, Lissa's boyfriend, uses his fire magic so successfully in the attack, that many are forced to re-evaluate the Moroi's 'helplessness' and the necessity of such harsh lives for the dhampir. Rose's friend Lissa who's been cavorting about, oblivious to the near-slavery that Rose has been facing as her protector, finally gets a long-overdue wake-up call about how selfish she's been when Rose ultimately abandons Lissa to drop out of school, mere days before graduation, to hunt down and confront the now-Strigoi Dimitri.earns her a molnija star tattoo meaning she's killed too many Strigoi to count.

B002OVEB5S|5.0|no this is not 1986 anymore so quit expecting slayer to do another reign in blood. they allready did it and changed metal forever by doing so......this cd CRUSHES! ther are a few songs that are a bit on the mellow side ala seasons in the abyss but it is a dark type of mellow with nice hooks. all of the elements that make slayer metal gods are here, fast galloping riffs with drumming to match and their signature crazy tremolo solos. if i had to compare this to other slayer cd's id say this one is a combo of rib,soh and sita. go listen to psycopathy red and tell me that aint something that could have been taken stright from reign in blood, it could be a lost track from 86. the production is very raw and real sounding. the guitars are raw and under distorted and the drums sound organic and not sampled and overproduced. i would have preferred a more modern production but this rawness suits the band well.    thrash to death you will not be dissapointed!

B002IVLH60|2.0|So, I've been listening to Pearl Jam since the day Alive premiered on MTV.  I watched that video and left my mouth on the floor only to close it when I was running out the door for the record store (Musicland in SpringHill Mall to be accurate - Anyone remember those?)    Funny thing is that Smells Like Teen Spirit premiered immediately after and it was background music to the awe I was in over the Pearl Jam sound.      I still get chills when I hear that album, and the songs off of the Singles soundtrack.  And then Vs. came out and I was in the parking lot of Rose Records in Crystal Lake, IL waiting for the midnight release party (Remember those, do they even happen anymore?  Does anyone ever get excited about music these days?) Vs. was decent but it was immediately obvious that the face of Pearl Jam was changing and the innocence and soul of that band (on vinyl) was never going to be the same.  I don't know what drives bands to mediocrity but rare are the few that can keep the magic of their sound alive album after album, to continue evolving and reinspiring the hope and emotion that drives us all to listen.      For me, had Pearl Jam never released another album besides Ten, I'd have been happier.      Then there is the third album, and it hada a few decent tracks on it, but mostly, the departure continued.  Everything after became a blur of albums and songs that I have been completely incapable of attaching to.  I've found no emotion, no hook, no sounds worth lending my ear.  I'll admit that I go back and try to give all the other albums a chance, No Code, Yield, Binaural, etc, but like I said, I couldn't tell you where one album ends and the next starts.  Where are the beautiful layers and the mystical tones of Eddies voice?  When was the last time he actually sang?  I miss grunge, it was the best period of music in the last 30 years, and I wish there was still music and evolution in sound as intense as the bands of that period coming out.  All of the greats have become as muddy and boring as the crap that gets played on the radio.  I only wish the next best thing was coming but I fear the worst.    That was until Eddie released his work on the Into the Wild soundtrack and my faith was restored.  I haven't sat and listened to an album beginning to end and enjoyed one track more than the next since the early 90's, and for me, this is what I want to hear.      This new album will get its listen and I hear some radio friendly poppy smile inducing stuff on here, but I don't want to smile, I want to feel, and I want to be drawn to tears so that when the smile comes its not for 3 overplayed minutes, but for 3 decades.
B001OQCV24|5.0|I think people judge these movies very unfairly. It surprises me when a movie like 2012 comes along and it's ripped apart before it's even released. \\"This movie's gonna blow, it's two and a half hours of things blowing up.\\" I have to play back the sentence in my mind and figure out what was negative about that concept. These movies are meant to be fun, and usually nothing more than that.<br /><br />I say \\"usually\\" because sometimes you get a movie that has absolutely no other reason to exist than to make things explode and momentarily lower your IQ ([[ASIN:B002IPFWTE Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Single-Disc Edition)]] is out now. Fun movie.) but occasionally you get something like 2012, which not only offers the calculated mayhem that fans of the action genre desire, but it also offers a surprisingly deep philosophical undertone. Go figure, right?<br /><br />The movie opens with a fifteen minute montage that sets up the events that will eventually transpire on 2012, and gives us a look at the backroom dealings that occur in the wake of this disturbing discovery concerning the fate of humanity. Once that's over with, the movie picks up rather quickly, introducing us to the main character, Jackson Curtis, his more-than-dysfunctional family and a grab bag of supporting characters. After a botched camping trip, things kick off rather quickly.<br /><br />What follows are two hours of absolute chaos. The CG in this movie is astounding, and I cannot stress this enough. The action is relentless, creative, and satisfying on the whole. The LA sequence alone will have you smiling, then you will realize you still have a lot more movie to go, and it never disappoints. The pacing is excellent in this regard. I was in awe the entire way through.<br /><br />That's the bottom line: If you love action movies or a good old fashioned thrill ride, the disaster sequences alone are worth the price of admission (unless you're an astrophysicist, in which case you might be crossing your arms and groaning at this film all the way through).<br /><br />But what I liked the most about this film was its underlying religious theme. People might be quick to pick up on the major references to this, such as (POSSIBLE SPOILER, though it's in the trailer): the crack forming between Adam and God on Michelangelo's \\"Creation of Adam\\" at the Sistine Chapel, the destruction of Christ the Redeemer, Vatican City, and the Buddhist temple. With these and other biblical references that you will miss if you blink, Emmerich seems to postulate a world in which you don't need God for miracles, and where everyone is back on even ground again.<br /><br />Another theme that Emmerich sets up is the social borders that divide us more than we think. In a world that is coming to an end, it's not the strong who survive, only the smartest and the wealthiest. The film argues against utilitarianism on several fronts, going so far as to say that to embrace such a concept to an outrageous extent, even to save mankind, would result in a race of humans deprived of its humanity.<br /><br />Now, I could be wrong. I'm not saying that my interpretation of the movie is spot on, but the movie did make me think, and that's what I found remarkable returning home from watching a film in which I thought I was just going to watch things blow up for two hours.<br /><br />I walked in knowing that no one makes disaster movies better than Roland Emmerich, but I ended up watching something that entertained me immensely, made me think, and spurred on a very long conversation between my friends and I.

Damn, how cynical can ya get?<br /><br />On the other hand, Sony could have done better than not have a lot of music from the film, so they get docked a star for that!<br /><br />The CD is actually a small, hardcover book. And inside, colorful and fun photos of Michael Jackson and his crew during the \\"This is It\\" rehearsals, of which the documentary of the same name is based.<br /><br />Not only will you find old standbys (Beat It, Thriller) but some jamming sessions and bits of music I have not heard before (Jam, Black or White).<br /><br />And the song, This is It, is played both with a piano version and a full orchestra version.<br /><br />And that's all on the first CD!<br /><br />The second CD is even more interesting.

B001PR0YDA|5.0|I love this story and have taught it in my English classes so I am very familiar with it.  There have been many versions but I have to admit I am a bit picky about the ones I really like.  I will add this to the list of the versions I will watch again and again.    The story stuck very closely to the book, using the same dialogue in most cases.  Nothing is lost in the story.  The characters were designed as they described in the book, which is not often the case.  The details in the homes, offices and in the city were magnificent.  It was almost like getting a history lesson in the bargain.  The movie did not hesitate to include the hunger and starvation that were a part of London in the mid-19th century.  There was a bit of comedy but it is not really a comedic book so it was kept to a minimum.  A few details were added to accommodate the 3-D but they fit in well with the movie.  Nothing vital was taken out and nothing unnecessary was added    The animation was wonderful.  The details were minute, even down the wind-chaffed red cheeks and noses of the Londoners.  At one point I could see the pores on Scrooge's nose.  I saw this movie in 3-D and I highly recommend it.  I see this as the future of movies, the effect was fantastic.  I am not a fan of Jim Carey but he did a good job in this rather than going over the top as he often does.      Highly, highly recommended although parts of the movie might be a little scary for very young children.
0439023483|5.0|This book has all the qualities of a movie. It is something that I can see all the twilight fans getting addicted to. I am a picky reader and will not waste my time on any books that are average or below average. This one immediately jumps into the plot and starts rolling. You never feel bored in this book. I would recommend this to others. It is a bit brutal, so 14 and younger should probably stay away. But like I said in a few years this will be a movie.

B001OQCV2O|3.0|Knowing Roland Emmerich's other films had me setting my expectation bar really low for 2012. Yes, the dialogue and script are beyond dumb at times, but that is exactly what most people should be expecting here. This is definitely one of those so bad it's good movies. It was also much longer than I thought it would be, clocking in at around two and a half hours (three if you include all the previews), but it held my attention throughout. The cast is quite large and features some big name actors like John Cusack, Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton and Oliver Platt, but most of them seem to be just going through the motions. I don't blame them because the script allows for nothing more. At least Woody gave it a wacky effort. I also found it funny how Cusack's character could drive his stretch limo and get out of more near death situations than James Bond on his best day. The one really bright spot are the amazing FX. I read that this film cost well over 200 million dollars to make and you can see why over and over again as you get bombarded by one visually stunning sequence after the next. In fact, I don't think the destuction of the Earth, as seen here, can ever be topped. I will probably end up buying this on Blu-ray to watch as a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />While this is a major step up from 10,000 BC, The Day After Tomorrow and Godzilla, it falls shy of his Emmerich's better work, The Patriot and Independence Day. If you just want to munch on some popcorn as billions of people perish before your eyes, nobody does it better or more often than when this guy gets behind the camera. Whether it proves to be fact or fiction, I know I marked December 21, 2012 on my calendar. Now that I think about it, the Mayans couldn't even predict their own demise, so I think we'll be okay.

B001UW58WW|5.0|David Garett's style is unusually novice. You reaallly feel the violin's power - or should I have said the power of the violonist? All the songs in the album have a genuine interpretation - so unique and exciting. Really recommend it if you want to listen to something that is familiar yet exciting and somewhat new; classic and yet not so much so..   I knew all the songs in the album, and yet as I listened to the David's playing I was moved and so excited as if hearing them for the first time.  Not to mention the impeccible speed with which he is capable of performing - it almost took my breath away. Stunning..   Very well done..

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What a great uplifting movie. The animation is wonderful, in fact I almost forgot that it was animated after 30 minutes. The story is completely 100% improbable, but so believeable and heartwarming.<br /><br />Up is a road movie. In the first 10 minutes Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner's voice) grows up, falls in love, gets married, and his wife dies before they can take their dream adventure trip to Paradise Falls. The first teary eyed moment. To avoid being hauled off to a retirement home, Mr. Fredricksen, ties a million balloons to his house and floats the house away. A young boy trying to earn his 'help the elderly' badge is a stow away in the house. The wonderful part of this movie is the boy and old man trying to get the house to Paradise Falls.<br /><br />The movie is one part Incredibles, one part Wizard of Oz, one part The Red Balloon, little bit Skinny and Fatty, and toss in a little Gran Torino (not the foul language or violence, but the relationship with the neighbor boy). The relationship between the old and the young boy is the real point of this film.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine how animation can get better than this. This film had wonderful pacing. It acted more like a film than a cartoon. Everything moved gracefully and naturally. It also didn't try to be the kind of creepy animated realism like Polar Express.<br /><br />This movie is for all ages. Thirteen year old son said he hated Disney cartoons and movies now, but he laughed many times and ended up enjoying this film.<br /><br />The single disc version has no bonus features - just the pure clean film. For those that want the movie and no nonsense, this is the answer.

B001Q2RXJ2|5.0|How exciting it must have been to be of age in Britain in 1980 and part of the burgeoning underground hard rock/heavy metal scene.  '80 arguably saw the NWOBHM movement at its absolute peak, with debut LPs being released by the scene's top contenders, most notably Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang and Girlschool.    With the exception of Iron Maiden, none of those groups however, not even Def Leppard, would chart that year as high as Barnsley's Saxon.  Their breakthrough LP (and second overall) \\"Wheels of Steel,\\" released in March of '80, peaked at #5 in the U.K. national charts, an astonishing feat in itself, but even more astonishing is that they would unleash its follow-up a mere seven months later.    And the amazing thing is that October's \\"Strong Arm of the Law\\" LP didn't suffer a bit from the usual sophomore slump and was actually even MORE rockin', even FASTER and overall better than its predecessor.    This record is chock full of mini metal masterpieces, not the least of which is opener \\"Heavy Metal Thunder,\\" yet another of Saxon's odes to their legions of headbanging fans.  The mere title indicates that here was a group that wore their metal colors with pride at a time when many of their peers were trying to distance themselves from that label.  From there, the title track is another monster of a rocker, and the group's record company seemed to agree at the time, as it was released as a successful single from the LP (singles were a big thing at this time).  And who could forget that Saxon were arguably one of, if not the fastest band to exist in heavy metal in 1980.  Just listen to the velocity of stand-out speed metal scorchers like \\"20,000 Ft.\\" and \\"Sixth Form Girls\\" for proof.  You just did not find tempos this rapid in music at the time without crossing over into hardcore punk.    And finally, in 2009, nearly 30 years after Saxon's peak, their early albums get CD releases that actually do these essential recordings justice.  Because if you ask me, the poor mixes of previous pressings all but stripped the music of its original rawness and power.  I am happy to report to you that you can in good confidence replace any previous Saxon CDs in your collection with these remasters, as I did.  The mere term \\"remaster\\" is ambiguous when dealing with music made long before the digital age dawned, as it usually involves replacing the original mix with something presumably \\"cleaner\\" and more up to date (read:  sterile) that all but ruins it.  To me, the best remaster of an album from 1980 is one that attempts to replicate the sound of hearing a brand new copy of the original vinyl.  These 2009 Saxon remasters do just that, so much so that I've officially retired my worn old Carrere LP pressings of these albums.    If that weren't enough, each reissue contains expanded liner notes with input from frontman Biff Byford himself, along with various clippings from the day and reproductions of the back covers of each LP, making them essential for collectors.    To summarize, mandatory NWOBHM album, and remasters that give these 30 year old recordings a new lease on life.  Highly recommended.

0385532458|5.0|I started the book on a Friday evening and laughed so much as I read the first story.  It was so typical, it was so himan, it was great.  I woke up my wife several times and after the first rebuke, her comments. \\"Hon, I must read that book.\\"<br /><br />Fetching Raymond was a truly family event. So real that it touched my heart. No one wants to be in that situation. However, it happens several times a year. It really affects you if it's your family and friends.<br /><br />Fish Files was an eye opener. It shows what can happen when people are in a situation that dictates a serious change of location. A good read. Same for Casino and Michael's room.<br /><br />Quiet Haven happens every day. When we seclude family and forget them, it's a shame.  However, Funny Boy made me cry real tears.  It really touched my heart.  I was so impressed that a person would look after another with little reward.  It told me that we have to look within ourselves to help others.  Why can't we see that truth.<br /><br />John, I know I have criticized you in the past but this is a great book of human experiences.  Thanks so much for the effort.

B000AWYOGE|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen and is definetly the worst in it's genre (I think supense, psychological thriller) or at least that's what it's supposed to be. Suspense yeah right, I was digging through my eyeballs trying to stay awake! Let me sum it up, the story sucks, the plot sucks, the action, well there was none. I'll admit this movie did have something going for it, I like the actress & the trailer was intriguing but that's it, after the first 20 minutes you already know it's going to be a disaster & it was, what a HUGE disapointment! It felt like a VERY cheap rip off of The Ring. Basically as I said it's the worse in it's genre, worst than The Grudge, worst than [...], worst than The Skeleton Key (yes, it really is that bad) you name it & it's better than this. Don't waste your money on this nobody liked it, it's JUNK!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer has definitely had an up-and-down track record throughout the years, but have still been able to consistently deliver quality albums.  Like any Slayer fan, I think everything from Show No Mercy to Seasons in the Abyss is the epitome of brutal thrash. I probably like Divine Intervention more than many Slayer fans; I think it was a nearly perfect album for 1994, when every other band was trying to sound like Pantera.  But then things started to stray a bit.  Undisputed Attitude and Diabolus in Musica represent a span of about seven years when there was no new Slayer that sounded like old Slayer.  Then, God Hates Us All began to move the band back into a more thrash-oriented direction, and that was continued even more when Dave Lombardo came back for Christ Illusion, which I thought finally came close to achieving the feel of an old Slayer album.<br /><br />Now comes World Painted Blood.  With this album, I think they come even closer to the old sound without quite getting there yet.  A lot of the fast riffing and drumming bring to mind Hell Awaits and Reign in Blood, while a little bit of the slower stuff is reminiscent of South of Heaven.  Other than that, I hear more Divine Intervention in some of the songs than anything else.  Here and there, you get some reminders of God Hates Us All as well.  And, Tom's vocals sound good, probably better than on Christ Illusion, and definitely better than on God Hates Us All, where he sounded like Sam Kinison on a few songs.<br /><br />So, to me that means that you have pros and cons.  I like that I hear traces of the older sound in much of the album, because that was my favorite era of Slayer's career.  But since it reminds me of about four different albums, that means World Painted Blood doesn't really establish its own distinctive feel as a whole.  I still give it five stars, though, because it is an incredibly solid album that will put a smile on the faces of old Slayer fans for a lot of reasons.  At this point, I'm just glad the band is still around and still trying to create music that their fans will love.  I think it's great that bands like Slayer, Overkill, Testament, and Exodus are putting out albums today that could fit right in with some of their older stuff.  I hope Slayer follows this up in a couple years with an album that is even more of a throwback than this one.is still around and still trying to create music that their fans will love.

B002MRROKI|5.0|\\"Live at Reading\\" captures the power of Nirvana at its loudest and most electric moment in 1992.<br /><br />People may wonder why on earth no one has released this album with Cobain radiating with raucous energy as his band crashes through the concert. After all, the entire performance is not just a raucous mess of blasting distortion, cymbal smashes and Kurt Cobain's throating yells and shouts. It is a sheer burst of excitement and infuriating anger.<br /><br />Most importantly, the band proved that even if a band gets out of tune or out of rhythm, they could set the whole stage ablaze. Literally. Songs like \\"Aneurysm\\" explode with fast drums and guitars before slowing to an unsettling steady rhythm. Then Cobain shatters the stage with the funky lyric, \\"Come on over and do the twist!\\"<br /><br />It's rock and roll fed through a power saw. Funk riffs such as those in \\"School\\" keep the audience engaged in chaotic violence as Cobain screams, \\"Won't you believe it's just my luck/NO RECESS!\\"<br /><br />More importantly, we can hear in the performance that Cobain's having loads of fun, especially when he sings and chuckles through the first lyrics of \\"Sliver.\\" He playfully growls through the low notes of \\"In Bloom.\\" The album captures Cobain on top of the world at the peak of Nirvana's popularity. Nothing is more epic than his screaming through the chorus of \\"Lithium\\" with a wave of audience members.<br /><br />The goofiest mistakes occurs in the parts following the opening power chords of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" in which Cobain literally messes up the two note riff and slides around his guitar as he tries to get the notes right. He even has a legendary anti-solo of chaotic random notes guitar neck sliding after the second chorus.<br /><br />Even as the band plays through the bittersweet song \\"All Apologies,\\" Cobain literally makes the song his own as he joyfully sings, \\"What else could I say?/All my words are great.\\" This concert shows Cobain at his prime. Even if this concert was foreshadowed by his suicide, it will forever be remembered as a benchmark for live albums in the 21st century.ill forever be remembered as a benchmark for live albums in the 21st century.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The Motion Picture had been out of print for quite a while, and I was wondering how and why Paramount would put that out of print, of course they released the Blu-Ray version of this set earlier, which I was kind of upset about because I don't have Blu-Ray, and I wanted these movies really bad on DVD, so a few months ago I bought Star Trek 'The Motion Picture' trilogy, but of course it only had 'The Wrath of Khan' 'The Search for Spock' 'The Voyage Home' and while I knew what movies it had with it, I was disappointed kind of, 'cause I wanted 'The Motion Picture' with it.    Well, finally a few months later, they released the standard definition version, I was very pleased when I had found out they did, it was on the top of my list to get (along with 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection, which I bought a few weeks ago), and they did a great job with that one, so I knew this one would be just as good...and it is.    You get all 6 motion pictures of course, as well as a bonus disc 'Captains Summit', which I have not watched yet, I will when I watch all the movies, of which 2 I hadn't seen before 'The Final Frontier' and 'The Undiscovered Country', and I watched them both last night, and I was very happy with them, I find 'The Final Frontier' to be very underrated, and 'The Undiscovered Country' was the perfect way to say goodbye (although in 'Generations' from 'The Next Generation' we saw Captain Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty one final time).    As for 'The Motion Picture' I find this one to be criminally underrated, I think it is a great start for the movie series, I guess I saw more than most other people saw in it, and even after seeing it countless times in my teens, it just never gets old, great underrated movie.    As for the trilogy part 'The Wrath of Khan' 'The Search for Spock' 'The Voyage Home', these were the most successful movies in the series, with good reason, it's just an awesome three part adventure, epic, full of action, great acting of course, and great stories, everything a Star Trek fan could ask for.    I can never get enough of Star Trek...well, aside from 'Deep Space Nine' and 'Enterprise'.    To me, Star Trek is and will always be 'The Original Series' 'The Next Generation' and 'Voyager'.    Bottom line, fans, buy this set, it is well worth the price paid for it, it pays for itself, and if you buy this set (and like it), what Star Trek fan wouldn't? I suggest buying 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection' as well, as it's just as nice as this.    Hope this review was helpful.
B002V0WN2K|3.0|I have every album that Bon Jovi ever made and I always get them the day that they come out as I keep up with their music. This is not their best work at all. It is kind of a downer. I work and go to school and don't need to hear music about working or how hard things are, I live it. Also, \\"We weren't born to follow\\" is really the only good song on it. I hate to say that but this is just not good. I have seen them twice live and the best albums were Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. Bounce and Have a Nice Day were awesome recent works then downhill from there.

0385737947|5.0|Thomas remembers only one thing when he wakes up in the dark elevator, and that is his first name. The elevator deposits him a glade where he finds himself surrounded other teen boys. Like him, the only thing that they remember of their lives is their names, and they all have found that they must survive in the Glade, surrounded by massive walls that close every night and protect the Gladers from the nasty creatures that roam the maze that surrounds their home. During the day, while most of the Gladers work for survival, an elite number of boys run out into the Maze, looking for an escape.    But everything changes the day Thomas arrives--he vaguely recognizes the Glade, and he knows he is meant to be a Maze Runner. And then the day after he arrives, a girl is deposited into the Glade. She's also vaguely familiar, and her arrival triggers a series of events that force the boys find a way out of the Glade. They can only succeed if somehow Thomas can unlock the secrets in his own lost memories.    The Maze Runner is intensely compelling from the first page, and James Dashner does an excellent job at drawing out the suspense as he reveals the truths about the Glade, the boys, and the Maze slowly and steadily. At the beginning of the story, Thomas doesn't know what sort of person he is, and it is very interesting to read about his reactions to certain situations and he tries desperately to remember anything about his past. He is a very sympathetic character as his frustration at the lack of information about the Maze often mirrors the reader's, but the story never becomes too vague or boring.     Dashner's action scenes are written extremely well, with just enough detail to put the reader into the moment, but not so verbose that readers will find themselves rushing through the paragraphs to discover what happens next. The plot moves at a steady, quick pace and the interactions between the boys provide plenty of laughs and drama. The Maze Runner is like a combination ofthe most interesting elements in Lord of the Flies and The Hunger Games, but infused with its own unique humor and slang and smart problem-solving skills that keeps you guessing all the way through, with an ending that will leave you hanging in suspense, with many unanswered questions and theories. The Maze Runner is a chilling, creepy read reminiscent of the TV show Lost, a book that will appeal to a wide range of readers.
B002N7W3NK|5.0|If you are a Diana Krall fan, you probably already have the Rio concert video, as I did, and have been savoring it. What's to recommend for the extra purchase with a 70 minute length disc?     How often can you experience up close, intimate performances from your favorite artist without the overlay of many instruments? Half of Disc 2 features 36 minutes of Diana singing solo at the piano for a benefit in Toronto (broadcast across Canada) on Heart Health for Women. She's pretty gutsy, pulling this off in an intimate, bare bones performance that left me so floored I had to hit the review button and watch it again! This tune list is; \\"Where or When,\\" \\"Exactly Like You,\\" \\"Walk on By,\\" \\"Deed I Do,\\" \\"Quiet Nights,\\" \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" \\"A Case of You,\\" and \\"I Don't Know Enough about you.\\" On \\"Frim Fram,\\" she jokingly changes certain of the lyrics (since this was a benefit on heart health) and then stops the song momentarily after she confessed that substituting \\"margarine\\" for \\"sha fafa\\" was over the top! It's clear she enjoys performance!    The Madrid Session comprises two songs, the first being a ten minute romp of \\"Deed I Do\\" followed by \\"So Nice\\" and \\"P.S. I Love you\\" (NOT the Beatles tune, of course). The crowd here appears more tepid or restrained in response. Anthony Wilson is the only member of her quartet from Rio to play with her. The others are different musicians.    The Lisbon Session is a favorite of mine. The combo is set up in a room and her band members--none from Rio--do exquisite work. Wow! I had to watch it again right away. Lovely ambiance and choreography.    The Rio Rooftop features Anthony Wilson on acoustic guitar, Jeff Hamilton playing brushes on what appears to be a rimmed, circular serving platter and Diana singing solo with no piano. It's like an impromptu jam of sorts, clearly informal, relaxed and atop a balcony with people seated nearby and also milling about. You can sometimes hear the surf and I swear I heard a small jet gun its engine overhead around the 11 minute mark. The set list is, \\"The Boy from Ipanema,\\" \\"Too Marvelous for Words,\\" \\"Cheek to Cheek,\\" and \\"Quiet Nights.\\" Very enjoyable. Tommy LiPuma sits nearby. I am sorry I don't know the name of the gentleman who harmonizes with Diana and sings Portuguese when prompted by her. There was a lady companion.    The disc closes with a video of \\"Quiet Nights\\" that includes footage you see excerpted in her performance of the same tune on Disc 1. I love her Rio concert and play the CD \\"Quiet Nights\\" often as I prepare dinner in the evenings. Great ambiance!    One more inclusion is a lavishly illustrated booklet that features the lyrics for every song on Disc 1.     I commend Diana for treating her audience to these unique, marvelous performances. Maybe someday I'll be able to see her perform live. But, until that opportunity arises, this disc set is a reasonable alternative for the interim!
0345410025|4.0|Dry. Definitely NOT a page turner. I mean it is a self help kind of book so I guess thats to be expected. The techniques can be useful. Actually they can be extremely powerful. Yet, no quick fix here, they are tough to learn and very tough to enact. You can find a few gems along the way however, that you may use in spite of the entirety of the techniques. Meaning, for example, step 2 of 5 on its own may be cool to use everyday, without the practice needed, to master the whole technique. Overall, Im happy with the purchase. I bought it to help me study for med classes. Unfortunately, I haven't had any eureka moments with the book, just feel like one more thing I have to practice and study. If I ever get around to mastering the book I could see it being invaluable. Right now though, its still post-it notes and flashcards for me.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Like an another reviewer intimated here, watching animated films the past five years, I have often shook my head and wondered, \\"How does it get any better than this?\\"  Then an animated film like this comes out and shows me.    Overall movies may not be better today than \\"in the old days,\\" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation.  This is another example of that.    The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning.  I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes.  From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny (and it's cheaper here at Amazon) to anyone who appreciates art.    By the way, this is not \\"a funny cartoon\\" but a suspenseful and sentimental adventure story, with a few laughs along the way. I would think adults would like this more than kids.  Meanwhile, everyone - regardless - will have their jaw drop more than once - viewing the incredible-looking scenes. Finally, if you like extras, sit back and enjoy: there are tons of them in this four-disc set.

B00008EY9G|3.0|This is a good psycho-thriller, in a wonderful atmosphere of drenching rain.  It is fun because the viewer is kept wondering what is going on - there is surprise after surprise, and the mystery keeps this from sinking into a normal slasher film.  There are many layers.  I was entertained right up to the end and did not guess what was going on, in spite of all the clues and abrupt shifts in point of view.  In addition, the cast of actors is very very good, from Cusack to DeMornay and the phenomenal Amanda Peet - they each metamorphose wonderfully as the viewer tries to figure out what is going on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is one of those films based on a single deceptive idea.  Once you get it, that's that.  It is not one that you can watch over and over for additional detail, much like Mamet's House of Games.  Moreover, that idea is not at all subtly used, when I think it could have been, but comes off as a caricature of a far more complex phenomenon.  As such, it cannot enter the pantheon of great films I own.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I would recommend this film.  But rent it.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I like \\"Soul Cake\\".  Other than that tune, the vocals remind me of Ellen Degeneres as Dorie the fish in Finding Nemo when she is impersonating a whale.  Actually, I would rather listen to whale recordings than listen to this.  This CD is going to be my white elephant gift at the holiday office Christmas party.  Last year my white elephant gift was a 3 foot clay Bart Simpson from Tijuana, so that should tell you something about the quality of this album.

0812974611|4.0|Well-written novel with fascinating characters.  The author makes seemingly effortless use of his knowledge of the period, and from my own reading, I think his portrait of the first century under Roman rule is realistic and richly detailed.  Harris weaves history, science, and engineering into the fictional events, but never loses focus on his tight and fast-moving plot.  He also does a convincing job with dialogue and descriptions of his main character's inner thoughts.  The novel keeps the reader's imagination fully engaged as the plot moves swiftly to the final crisis when Pompeii is destroyed, and the main characters make a desperate dash for their lives.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the period, as well as to many who just appreciate a colorful and exciting yarn.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE,I THINK ITS ONE OF THE BEST SI-FI MOVIES EVER MADE,I HAVE THE DVD,BUT WHEN IT CAME OUT ON BLU RAY I JUST HAD TO HAVE IT!!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Pulls, Tugs and Dances with all of your emotions from happy-dance feelings, excitement, and explicit appearance of the insinuation of sexual desire in all of its wonderful forms without crudity--laughter and the finality of deep heart wrenching grief that the audience experiences.  This movie moves you up and down the emotional scale.  Absolutely amazing music and dancing!  Loved it even though I was exhausted after each time I saw it.  Think I've seen it 4 or 5 times.
159448385X|5.0|Hosseini's second book, while a depressing depiction of women's rights in Afghanastan, is beautifully written.  Laila and Mariam are dynamically weaved.  He somehow makes something that should not be relate-able to most very digestible and emotional.  There are twists and turns that keep the reader engaged. For someone who knows nothing of the culture or region, Hosseini - despite his admitted liberties with the geography - has introduced the area.<br /><br />Despite it's rather morose ending, there is a call to action and hopefulness.  He leaves the reader to consider solutions to what seems like a situation that should not exist.  This ability to inspire the reader despite depicting rather dire circumstances is what makes this book a strong candidate to be on modern reading lists.  It is quickly becoming a book that educated people read.  That said it's not so high brow that everyone can't appreciate it.
B0029O08WA|3.0|After the first Twilight movie soundtrack, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this album.  There was a lot of hype around how many \\"bands of the first water\\" had been contracted to compose unique songs just for the new album and movie.  I pre-ordered the album before any of the songs had been released for preview.<br /><br />When I started listening to the album - I was disappointed.  The unique blend of power and energy that made the original Twilight soundtrack so driving was completely absent.  Though the music on the CD is good, I have to say that it's slightly shoddy as an album.  It's too slow, and too sentimental - with few to no escapes from its ponderous tempo.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is one of the best guitar-driven albums ever. I don't think there's a weak spot. Should be required for any student of rock/blues/jazz guitar.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Great Story line -- amazing movie -- holds you in your seat -- amazing music.  There isn't a negative thing to say about this movie.  Great movie to see during hard times in life.
B000088E6D|5.0|I bought this CD because I had heard \\"Kissing a Fool\\" on the juke box recently by Michael Buble - I love the whole CD. I am a big fan of the crooners and Michael does a great job of these classic songs. Excellent music for a romantic dinner.
B001DSNELK|4.0|As a collector of such movie memorabelia I was nicely surprized by the quality of this package.  The figurine is very high quality (not cheap plastic) :)  It comes with a nice booklet about the movies. Some echtophlasem and a $25 gift card.  The movies themselves have been relabled for this collectors set. (Not two seperate ordinary dvds packaged together as so many \\"collector sets\\" sets are these days.:)

B00177YA1K|5.0|My VHS copy had tape sticking out of the cassette and one of my cats spotted it and thought it was ribbon I guess.  Needless to say, she tore sections out of it.  So much for repairing it.  I immediately went to Amazon and bought a new one.  This time, DVD.  Cat proof.
0060531053|5.0|Charlie Papzian's book is the first step for those planning to start homebrewing. Papazian gathers all the information you need to get off the ground without bogging you down in technical details.    For those interested in intermediate to advanced homebrewing, this is not the book for you, but for beginners this book is nearly essential.     I started with this book and within 6 months I was doing all-grain brewing. This book is accessible without being short of information. I highly recommend this book.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Loved the CD's, but all the jewel cases came broken.  Amazon doesn't pack them well at all.  They just put all my disc's in a box that was way too big and didn't use any bubble wrap or styrofoam peanuts.  After letting them know about this, I didn't even get a response, not even an automated one.  I will not use Amazon again, and I will not recommend them to anyone.
0195145925|4.0|I enjoyed this book for presenting most of the time-related physics in a single book.  As others have pointed out, there's something \\"dense\\" about the visualizations and analogies used to explain the topics, but I found that somewhat useful for forcing me to look at the concepts again with fresh eyes.  After reading the book, I think there are probably clearer ways to explain these concepts, and it just seems that J.B. was struggling to say what he means without math.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is very little, if anything, that's new in this book, and I think the author acknowledges as much through some of the anecdotes of his career as a physicist.<br /><br />o The Minkowski space of General Relativity treats the time dimension as equivalent to the space dimensions.<br />o There is no present moment in physics, or a movement in time.  Classical \\"block time\\" looks at the universe as a four-dimensional painting, and physics is the study of the relationships between the \\"swirls\\" in the painting.<br />o Machian timeless classical physics is over 100 years old.<br />o The Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunction is over configuration space not regular space and is not restricted to configurations with causal continuity.  So as far as the quantum mechanical view of the universe, time continuity is not required.<br />o His concept of \\"best-matching\\" is already implied in General Relativity, as he points out eventually in the book.<br />o Time Reversal Invariance is nothing new either.  There's no direction of time in physics.  The asymmetry (physical arrow of time) only says that the universe has low entropy on the left side, and high-entropy on the right side (or vice-versa if you flip the picture).  The universe can be studied from left to right or right to left.  As Hawking points out, it's strange that we think the reverse of our psychological sensation of time is unfamiliar because that is exactly what is happening.  And so, Hawking's famous question, \\"Why do we remember the past but not the future.\\"<br /><br />At this point physics does fine without addressing the psychological features of time such as the present moment, its movement, direction, and apparent continuity, but eventually the physics may force the issue as quantum mechanics has already run into the problem of \\"people\\".  For example, the Schrodinger and Wheeler-DeWitt equations have no need to drop out of the complex-number plane of superposition and into the real numbers.  The physics is fine with the whole universe being in superposition of all the possibilities allowed by the wavefunction over configuration space.<br /><br />But people insist that we never experience superposition, and since observation is an essential part of physics, the observer comes into play.  We end up having to force the wave function into a specific instance (observable state), which causes the physics to go into only one of the possible instances of the universe.  That's a serious problem because QM can't tell us deterministically which one we'll find ourselves in when we make the measurement.  So we have various kinds of quantum uncertainty like \\"quantum jitters\\" in the vacuum, etc.  In fact, the Bell theorem points out that it is not possible to predict which universe will be measured by certain types of observations.<br /><br />So, I think, Julian Barbour's book has value in presenting the kind of problems we'll run into, as QM already has.  For example, one of the problems he addresses is preserving causality when the Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunction doesn't preserve continuity of time, since it's a probability function over configuration space.  He proposes that it'll probably turn out that the wavefunction allows only universes which do have a continuous causal link between their boundaries (the big bang and whatever is at the other end) since that is the kind of universe that we experience (above microscopic scales).  He doesn't have an explanation though for how or why it would do that.<br /><br />I think the point of the \\"End of Time\\" title is that, just as the interpretations of quantum mechanics are there to comfort our perceptions but not necessary to the physics of it, so are our conceptions of time fitting to our perceptions, but not needed to understanding the physics of the universe.  At this point, anyway.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I trudged through to the end, but mainly because on the physics side (rather than philosophical) there are few books which focus on the unanswered questions of the topic.
B000VBIGD6|2.0|Saturday Night Live alumnis Chevy Chase in his 20th film released in 1989,stars in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation;the third installment in the franchises' long and still continuing history.Chase on SNL is not much different from Chase on the big screen,as he displays an alarming lack of range relying mostly on his constant mugging and less than stellar one liners.In fact he was better in his element on TV and(providentially)his career has waned into almost oblivion on the big screen since the early 90s.<br />The film really can be pared down into about four distinctive \\"plotlines\\".Find a Christmas tree,insert gags,take tree home.Get out Christmas Lights,insert gags,turn on said lights.Irritating relatives arrive,insert gags,relatives are ok in the end.And finally,want raise,insert gags,finally get raise.Picture ends with a slow pull back shot of Chase looking vacantly into the night sky and proclaiming\\"I did it\\"....cue in music.<br />Simple is the word and the mostly moronic humour is the byword throughout.Admittedly most of the Lampoon films were made with the cheap laughs in mind and nothing more.They don't pretend to be anything higher than what they are and you gets what you sees.<br />The pacing here is also one of stops and starts.Just as it starts to get a head of steam on it it slows down for a shopping trip or a conversation with a relative.<br />Technically the film has been remastered very well and is shown in its' original theatrical ratio.The special features,if you can call them that(especially for a so-called\\"special edition\\"),consist of the trailer and some pretty lame commentary by members of the cast(Chase not included).The DVD case itself is also very cheap...no expense spared here;no expense at all!<br />If you are into the National Lampoon flicks,especially those with Chase then this film is up your alley.If Chase looking at a buxom girl and saying\\"I was just blousing,er browsing\\" is your idea of comedy,that is of the very simple,low and frat house type of \\"humour\\" it really is,then this is for you; no doubt.For those expecting more,it warrants a big pass.humour\\" it really is,then this is for you; no doubt.For those expecting more,it warrants a big pass.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is one of the best social responsibility themed documentaries I have ever watched. I feel that this documentary covers all the bases on animal fair-treatment, the food safety impacts of industrial farming, and sustainable food production practices.    Food Inc goes in depth on the production operations of a sustainable Virginia chicken, beef, and pork farmer. This farmer is probably at least a little eccentric, but everything he says about pigs exercising their \\"pigness\\" and cows being cows makes total sense. He invited the cameras in to see how he raises, feeds, and even slaughters the animals. The film treats very fairly the contrast between this approach and the approach that industrial-scale meat packer Perdue requires its farmers to follow.    The film provides some focus to food safety, particularly as it relates to the role industrial processes play in promoting toxic e. coli proliferation. Alas, the film fails to make as clear a case for how e. coli has become such a problem as it has for the issues related to fair treatment of animals.    I appreciated the film's exploration of public food subsidies and how they impact food choices and public health. We follow a low-income Los Angeles-area family that is forced to buy cheap fast food instead of broccoli due to price and time. To summarize, a hamburger would be more expensive, but corn, soybean, and wheat overproduction paid for by the US farm-subsidy bills feeds cows and keeps beef cheaper than it should be.    There were pretty naive complaints of Monsanto's practice of prohibiting farmers from using the seeds that are naturally produced season after season on-farm by the plants it has engineered and patented. Monsanto prosecutes farmers doing this because this cuts into Monsanto's sales -- there's no reason to buy Monsanto's product if you can, in essence, re-use their product season after season. Unfortunately, the arguments were only skin deep and were akin to those that throw up their hands at thefact that pharmaceuticals cost so damn much money. Yeah, the seeds only cost a a tenth of a cent to produce, but the first seed cost $100 million, so what is Monsanto to do? Food Inc should have probed this issue deeper.    I would encourage anyone watching the DVD-version to catch the extras. The deleted scenes could have easily been rolled into the feature but for length.
B002BEXF5A|5.0|Two discs 56 and 58 minutes each approximately.  The sound is very good,especially for a live (Sept.3,1976) recording.  The second disc is from rehearsals (Aug.23,1976) at Shepperton Studios.  The discs are snapped in,bare,in the back of the book-style package which I,personally,have never been fond of-a minor quibble.  The package itself is much like a hard cover book,with the notes attached inside the very thick covers.  Included in the notes are personal recollections from the band members,which add insight to the history of this concert,and color photographs of the band on stage,and individually.  There are also reproductions of ads for the band and music festivals.  Richard Williams' column from the Melody Maker (MM) magazine is also here.  He writes about both his concert experience and the band itself,which is an added plus.  The words of the various songs are also reprinted.<br /><br />By now most everyone who likes Phil Manzanera or Eno,is familiar with the original release of the live album.  An album that Manzanera calls a high point in his career.  And for good reason.  Mostly instrumental,this band had that certain something-where everything seemed to come together,which made this concert (and recording) something special.  For those who don't know much about this band,the members were: Phil Manzanera-guitar,Brian Eno-vocals,keyboards,and guitar,Simon Phillips-drums,Lloyd Watson-slide guitar,Francis Monkman-keyboards,and Bill MacCormick-bass.<br /><br />Formed in 1976,Manzanera wanted to get some musicians together to play some concerts during the summer.  Unfortunately,this band only played three concerts before breaking up.  The material is mostly from both Eno's and Manzanera's solo albums.  Some of the high points are a rendition of THE BEATLES \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (T.N.K.),which is transformed into something a bit different than THE BEATLES recording,\\"Rongwrong\\",\\"Diamond Head\\",and \\"Sombre Reptiles\\",among many others.  But with music of this caliber,everyone will have their own high points.  Throughout these discs Manzanera's playing is just this side of awesome,with the rest of the band (Lloyd Watson's slide guitar is a standout) not far behind.<br /><br />The second disc of rehearsals follows pretty much track-for-track,the live disc,for the first five tracks.  The live track \\"Golden Hours\\" is not heard on this disc.  However,\\"Lagrima\\",is heard twice,the second time being a reprise.  The other live tracks are heard,but in different order.  It's interesting that the rehearsal numbers aren't all that different than the live tracks,except in feel-the live recordings have that certain visceral feeling when a band plays in front of a live audience.  But don't think this disc has no fire-power,it definitely does,with the whole band contributing some very powerful music.<br /><br />This up-dated release is worth owning if listeners want (presumably) all the tracks recorded by this great,but short-lived,band.  I still own (and play) the English import of the live disc on vinyl.  At the time this album had that certain something which set it apart from other releases of this type of music.  Now,with this deluxe release,listeners can hear both the impressive live,and rehearsal music that this great band recorded,so many years ago.

B00000JPH6|4.0|This is another retro-review featuring movies/DVDs that have been out for quite some time but I have never critiqued.This one I recently revisited for the first time since its' first release in theatres back in /82;and gladly it has not lost any of its'power to fascinate.<br />Inspired by fantasy characters from the works of Brian Stroud,Henson came up with a plot which involves the Crystal of Truth.The Urskeks were once the guardians of this huge crystal but cracked it,thus splitting their race into the gentle Mystics and the evil Skeksis(symbolic of the evil/good in all creatures).<br />The Skeksis are large,ugly bird like creatures who rely on the power of the now Dark Crystal to dominate their world.However prophecies fortell of a Gelfling who is to recover the broken shard from the broken Crystal of Truth and restore the Urskeks race.The Skeksis try to make sure this never happens,but fate is in motion and a Gelfling by the name of Jen is the chosen one.Along his journey he meets another Gelfling(elf-eared creatures),called Kira.The knowledge of one compliments the other and together they journey back to the Dark Crystal and restore the shard and the Urskek race.<br />A totally engaging and imaginative tale,The Dark Crystal was a perfect vehicle in which Henson would display his numerous talents as a puppeteer.As the founding father of the Muppets,he and his close collaborator Frank Oz created a unique world here and the myriad of creatures brought to life on screen,big and small,is astounding.For instance,watch the scene where Jen is sitting in the swamp.As the camera pans left to right watch for all the critters that emphasize just how alive the swamp really is.And little touches like Kira's dog when it barks/whines when it fears it's getting left behind;very visible are its' tonsils.The details make the film that much more enjoyable,and Henson was a stickler for details.<br />The picture was produced with the minimum of computer help.While his Labyrinth was mostly humans,humans in costume and muppets,The Dark Crystal features mostly men in costumes and muppets,no humans.It was quite an undertaking but Henson pulled it off brilliantly.Henson left us too soon and it makes you wonder just how much he would have been able to accomplish with today's technology had he survived.<br />As an aside I do not know if this is the original print of the movie.I seem to recall that some creatures spoke their own language and it was subtitled.I recall that that slowed the pace of the movie somewhat but this print actually enhances it without it so,unusually,I'm not complaining.Although it would be nice to have the original print and this one to compare them.<br />Technically the back jacket on this particluar release(2005) says it has been mastered in Hi-Def but the print,while clear,still shows a little too much dirt specs.A recent remastered release is much better picture wise but it lacks all the special features existing on this release.Those include a documentary on the films making,deleted funeral scenes,original language work print scenes,drawings and profiles and the original trailer.Maybe one day they will release all of these features on one disc.<br />For now however this film/DVD is certainly a keeper.This wonderful film will amuse and facinate both the young and young at heart.While we have relatively little of puppet master Henson's works on celluloid,there is much to savour in every one of his works and The Dark Crystal is no exception.mans in costume and muppets,The Dark Crystal features mostly men in costumes and muppets,no humans.It was quite an undertaking but Henson pulled it off brilliantly.Henson left us too soon and it makes you wonder just how much he would have been able to accomplish with today's technology had he survived.

0784011680|5.0|Chaplin was a great Artist, and a pioneer of film, arguably the great art form of the 20th Century. American Poet Hart Crane put it this way, in his poem, Chaplinesque:<br /><br />We make our meek adjustments,<br />Contented with such random consolations<br />As the wind deposits<br />In slithered and too ample pockets.<br /><br />For we can still love the world, who find<br />A famished kitten on the step, and know<br />Recesses for it from the fury of the street,<br />Or warm torn elbow coverts.<br /><br />We will sidestep, and to the final smirk<br />Dally the doom of that inevitable thumb<br />That slowly chafes its puckered index toward us,<br />Facing the dull squint with what innocence<br />And what surprise!<br /><br />And what surprise it was for Hart when after answering a knock on his door he saw a friend with the great comedian himself in tow. The three spent many whimsical hours together, I'm sure. I will continue the poem at this review's conclusion. While I never had the privilege of meeting Mr. Chaplin, I almost feel like I have, after seeing Richard Attenborough's film, Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. gave an excellent performance, recreating the great comedy and character of The Little Tramp, and also providing insight into the man behind the myth.<br /><br />I remember seeing Chaplin finally honored by the Academy after living in exile for so many years. There was a confused, frightened look in his eyes, as if he was afraid that he was about to be ambushed by his old nemesis, J. Edgar Hoover. He looked, as Hart Crane said in another poem, \\"confused among the chrysanthemums.\\" There was also something else, the sense that his contribution was appreciated after all. He was finally getting validation. Robert Downey Jr. really captured that bittersweet moment, and all the other moments in Chaplin's life.<br /><br />Chaplin's case and the memorable \\"Oscar Moment\\" reminded me of two other events at the Oscars. One was when Roman Polanski, also in exile, won Best Director for The Pianist. Compare and contrast Chaplin's case with Roman Polanski. Discuss it amongst yourselves, as I have no real point to make--only that it was oddly similar, and oddly different. Then when Elia Kazan won a Lifetime Achievement award, some people refused to stand up for his standing ovation. Nick Nolte sat there looking as grim as a Malibu mug shot. Chris Rock later commented on the incongruity between the reaction for Polanski and the one for Kazan, who had named names to HUAC. How rude of Rock, and no wonder he wasn't asked back to host, but he did have a point.<br /><br />Chaplin, the film, makes a very good case that J. Edgar Hoover persecuted Chaplin, the man. There is a scene where Charlie is shown (wittily but unwittingly) planting the seeds of rancor:<br /><br />--------------------------<br />J. Edgar Hoover: I have to wonder if you people realize the level of responsibility you carry. From my way of thinking, Motion Pictures are potentially the most influential form of communication ever invented. And there's no control over it. Your message reaches everyone, everywhere.<br />Mary Pickford: Message?<br />J. Edgar Hoover: Of course, Mr. Chaplin here reaches millions who only have to see; and when they see a mockery being made of our immigration services, I call that a message.<br />Charlie Chaplin: Yes, well, uh, as you've already said Mr. Hoover, Motion Pictures are for the people; most of the people work for a living, and they don't make much money doing it; gives them pleasure to see an official from the upper classes getting a kick up the backside. Always has, and it always will; and if that can change things, so much the better.<br />[in a better pronounced, less cockney voice]<br />Charlie Chaplin: Bet-ter.<br />=====================================<br /><br />What was it that Frank Zappa said about the reason Lenny Bruce died? And what was it Richard Nixon said to H.R. Haldeman when he heard that J. Edgar Hoover had died? Funny (again not funny ha ha) that Anthony Hopkins and James Woods, both in this film, played Nixon and Haldeman, respectively, in Oliver Stone's Nixon. And what were the final two stanzas of Hart Crane's poem, Chaplinesque? Why, look down below:<br /><br />And yet these fine collapses are not lies<br />More than the pirouettes of any pliant cane;<br />Our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise.<br />We can evade you, and all else but the heart:<br />What blame to us if the heart live on.<br /><br />The game enforces smirks; but we have seen<br />The moon in lonely alleys make<br />A grail of laughter of an empty ash can,<br />And through all sound of gaiety and quest<br />Have heard a kitten in the wilderness.<br /><br />Geraldine Chaplin played her own grandmother, Charlie Chaplin's mother, Hannah, who was plagued by madness. She was excellent, but what would you expect? It's in her blood. Her presence gave the whole project the Chaplin Stamp of Approval.<br /><br />John Thaw was familiar to me as Inspector Morse, the title character from the British detective program. He played impresario Fred Karno, who gave Chaplin his first job, but also boorishly sabotaged his budding romance with Hetty Kelly. Akroyd was good as Mack Sennett, the man who gave Chaplin his big break in the film industry. James Woods was the 'persecuting attorney' who tried Chaplin in a bogus paternity suit. Anthony Hopkins was playing an editor, and had a utilitarian role to move the exposition along, when Chaplin was being vague about certain aspects of his personal life. A framing device. Not an actual person, a composite character.<br /><br />Kevin Kline was good as Douglas Fairbanks, doing some impressive stunts, but I can see him as Cole Porter in De-Lovely, or Guy Noir in A Prairie Home Companion, but I don't see him as Douglas Fairbanks. Funny (not funny ha ha, but funny weird/strange) that in the bonus material of Prairie Home Companion his fellow thespians, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, describe him as \\"our generation's Chaplin.\\" Though he played The Pirate King in a film of Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance, that still doesn't qualify him to play Fairbanks. A minor quibble. He did a good job, but he didn't melt into his character like Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />Moira Kelly played a dual role: both Hetty Kelly, young Charlie's first crush, and Oona O'Neill Chaplin, his last wife. I guess that was supposed to show that he was searching for that lost love of his youth. Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann Miller, and Milla Jovovich played other women in Chaplin's life.<br /><br />Bottom line is Chaplin was a very good film, successful as a biopic, and also as an historical chronicle showing the role of film and comedy in our country's history, and the intersection of politics and comedy. The Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Supporting Cast were all top notch. Great performance by Downey, who is a master of comedy and drama, and also not a stranger to controversy in his own life. He was perfect for this role.

Bottom line is Chaplin was a very good film, successful as a biopic, and also as an historical chronicle showing the role of film and comedy in our country's history, and the intersection of politics and comedy. The Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Supporting Cast were all top notch. Great performance by Downey, who is a master of comedy and drama, and also not a stranger to controversy in his own life. He was perfect for this role. He could relate.      ---------------------------------  Charlie Chaplin: Nothing quite like it.

0802136834|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Alison Weir is so talented, and this book reads like a novel, not a historical account. It is truly fascinating and I recommend every book that she has written.
B0029O08WA|2.0|As a Twilight obsessed mom, with 3 Twilight obsessed teenage daughters, we are bonkers for everything Twilight. We've read the book series upwards of 6 or 7 times, including the draft Midnight Sun. We saw Twilight in the theatres about 8 times before it came out on DVD, which we were in line for at midnight to purchase. We love everything Twilight. Except the New Moon soundtrack.     We were so excited to hear the New Moon music we we ripping it open on the way from the store to the car and listened to every song by the time we drove home. It was a major dissapointment. Every song sounds exactly like the last one. Every male singer sounds like every other male singer on the soundtrack- and the same for the female singers, which, we noted, there were few.     There is a clear depressed theme to the music, and while we get that much of the story is about darkness and sadness, there is a huge part that is about emergence, overcoming, finding friendship, reunion and rejoycing. Where are the songs for these? Unlike the Twilight soundtrack, which gave us an eclectic mix of upbeat and downbeat stuff that covered the range of emotions and tones in the story and the movie, New Moon's soundtrack has no range, no diversity and no love from us. The Twilight soundtrack raised the bar high, but unfortunately the New Moon soundtrack fell far, far short.    I would still buy it because I can't imagine not having a piece of anything Twilight, but just don't expect to be wowed by it. We found a couple of songs that grew on us after listening to it a few times, and have high hopes the music will fit in better when we actually see it partnered with the movie.
0307716988|4.0|I thought the book was ok...I must admit that I liked it better before I read the transcripts from his interview with that Rabbi in 2000...after reading those, I felt like I REALLY got a good sense of who MJ was as a person.  This book focused more on MJ the artist, which was also interesting to read. He doesnt slander anyone, which is one of the things I always admired about him.  He mainly talks about what went into making Off The Wall and Thriller, and doing the Victory Tour with his brothers.  He talked about Bad rather briefly, which was a bit disappointing, but I suppose he wrote this as he was about to embark on that tour...I wouldve loved to read about his experience on tour.  I really wasnt interested in pre-pubertal MJ (the MJ of I want you back, ABC, I'll be there, etc) because I know that story all too well, and I'm glad MJ himself didnt spend too much time talking about those days cuz as he put it, \\"I really dont remember...I was so young.\\"  I did appreciate MJ giving tidits of info about his relationships with his brothers, his family and the women he dated, which was all sugarcoated for sure, but insightful nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was simple yet witty, honest yet sugarcoated; a good read and highly reccommended to all MJ fans.
031606792X|5.0|I am just starting to read the fourth and final book.  I can't wait, I do recomend it to any body who likes a good book.  This is defiantly a good series of books to get into.  They have kept me hooked all the way through.
0756405890|2.0|Formula for Name of the Wind:  steal a bunch of concepts from other very popular series and throw them all together in one novel - make the character an egotistical teenage boy so all the vicariously-living-through-fantasy teenage (and many older) boys out there will \\"identify\\" with him. Add in a nondescript female interest and a lot of theatrics and *BAM*.  We now have a vaguely boring book that promises a lot and delivers very little.  Yawn.  Sure, for an intro novel, it's not bad.  But, it's not the wonderful book everyone proclaims it to be... unless you're like, 15, and haven't read much else.  The flow of the story was very forced - a lot of time was put into setting up situations that, once they occurred, weren't worth the huge build-up.  Random meandering into nothingness and gross inconsistencies in character's behavior that were added just for a \\"look how cool this is\\" effect.  Basically, even the book seemed to think more of itself than was warranted.  Took me months to finish this thing because, well, it was generally *BORING*.  I finish most books this size in under a week; reading \\"Name of the Wind,\\" I kept closing it after a few pages cause I had other stuff to do.  I won't say the book didn't have potential (which is the reason I finished it - kept hoping it would get better... you know, the hype insisted it would) but too much time was spent on the author's ego and general pettiness.  Blarg.  I'd recommend a good stack of Charlie Huston books instead.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Disney could have done a great job with this adaptation of a Chinese folk tale. But unfortunately, they just had to ruin it with some comedy. Now, I'm not saying that this automatically makes the film a complete failure. The animation is top-notch, with some beautiful scenery and a powerful action sequence. The drama really adds to the tension in some scenes. The music from Jerry Goldsmith is also a treat. But what really makes this a mediocre Disney film is the unnecessary comedy. Disney could have made this one of its more outstanding animated films, if it weren't for all that humor. Instead of it being a serious epic like Princess Mononoke, Mulan is more of an uneven display of drama and slapstick. All of this funny stuff is very out of place for such a powerful folk tale. Couldn't they have taken Mushu more seriously? Plus, the songs are very forgettable. \\"A Girl Worth Fighting For\\" and \\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\\" aren't in the same level as \\"Be Our Guest\\" and \\"I Just Can't Wait to be King.\\" There are no memorable melodies and no decent lyrics, though \\"Reflection\\" is a slightly up there.<br /><br />So Mulan is basically a mixed bag. The stunning animation and the apparent drama are what's good about it. The unnecessary comedy and underwhelming songs are what's bad about it. It's too bad, really. This project had some big potential, but they just had to turn it into an adequate animated film.<br /><br />Grade: C
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Visually stunning, but that alone is not enough to carry this movie.  This is for sure a one-time watch - so rent, don't buy.  I think this movie sets the record for number of cheesy lines.  Maybe 50% of the dialog is mindless predictable one-liners you've heard 100 times already in other movies.  There is no character development to speak of, there are no surprises in the plot.  Very tiring to watch this movie in one sitting.  I gave it one star only because of the visual treat (and because you can't give it none :) ).
B00009R6H2|5.0|When I purchased the Manfrotto 410PL Quick Release plates, I had pondered my choices and examined my options well. Because I do not make a living on photography ultra professional equipment that cost a king's ransom was not part of my shopping lexicon.<br /><br />Yet, as a serious hobbyist, I still needed solid, precise and quality components. So Manfrotto was not an absent name while I was shopping.<br /><br />I bought the 88RC4 Ball heads and made them uniform equipment on all my tripods. These quick release adapters now grace the bottoms of all my cameras and big lenses and are permanently affixed to them. This makes changing equipment an enjoyable task rather than aggravatingly opportunity-wasting clumsy affair.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I so loved this book.  Much better than the first one!  I loved learning more about our lead female character!
0061914177|5.0|Gary did a great job putting this book together - he crushed it - He has shared some sites I had not heard of and I now have put to use that made a differance in my blog ranking. He passed along ideas that are BOLD and are very direct. I like it.<br /><br />He has the branding model key down pat and his passion shows in all he does. He is all or nothing.<br /><br />I love his straight forward approach.
B001LJWKKC|2.0|I noticed the price of the mp3 version was pretty high, around $18. But the CD and DVD version is around $22. Also nobody has reviewed the mp3 version, so I wanted to add a review for that based solely on pricing.    How much does product packaging etc cost for Amazon, the producers etc on an imaginary mp3 product \\"package\\" to cost so much for each track and to have such a high album price? Outrageous, but at least the are free of evil DRM.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots being the Flaming Lips 10th studio album and their 2002 is a mix of alternative rock, space rock and psychedelic pop. The critics gave the album high marks and Allmusic, NME and Rolling Stone all wrote positive reviews. The booklet has some weird art but having psychadelic elements this fits well with with this genre of music. All lyrics are included but not a list of whom plays what. 4/5.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Should have never been canceled! Great cast, great plots, funny, interesting, good thematic overtones of politics, class, and religion.
B000000OA6|4.0|Innuendo being Queens 14th studio and the last album to be composed of all new material. Queen being Queen explores a variety of music styles and the album can be said to feature  rock, hard rock, heavy metal, psychedelic rock and progressive metal. The album was met with in my own opinion harsh reviews. Allmusic and Rolling Stone gave it 3/5 which I think is too low. Songs that stand out on this release are \\"Innuendo\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\". The booklet has all the lyrics  and a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.
B000002G26|5.0|It's too bad we don't have guys like Brian Adams pumping out the hits anymore. I, myself played professionally for 26 years touring as lead guitarest with the beach Boys among others so, a CD must be top notch for me to order it. I have a large touring motorcycle now with a great sound system and Brian Adams is a \\"must have\\" for the saved music on my Ipod. Every song on this CD is a hit in itself. The summer of 69 has got to be one of the best songs ever produced. The sound quality is state of the art even by current standards.
B00005QCFV|5.0|Queen - Greatest Hits V.2 being Queens second greatest hits compilation and includes the hits between 1981 to 1991. The compilation was released on month before Mercurys untimely death and is the last record to be released whilst he was still alive. The album is loaded with amazing tracks such as \\"Under Pressure\\" which was a co-production with David Bowie. Other amazing tracks are \\"One Vision\\" and \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\". Allmusic gave the compilation 4/5 which is a little low since it is in my humble opinion of the best compilation albums ever released. The booklet is very well done and has many great pictures of the band during the 1980's. For each track we get a short descriptor about who produced it and how well it did in the charts and other tidbits for instance the track \\"I want to break free\\" became \\"an antehm in many oppressed areas of the world\\". 5/5.
0385504225|2.0|First, you have to discount the huge expectations awaiting this book. How do you follow the Da Vinci Code? The answer is you don't, but how close can you come?    Good fiction has to be at least vaguely plausible (even science fiction) and some parts of this book are simply ridiculous. The secret cabals, the close escapes, the all too stereotypical bad guy who is smarter than everyone else around until he suddenly becomes dumber. The characters are little more than paper cutouts pasted in place to give potential to a movie deal and allow the casting to be innovative.    You learn a little about the Masons, not much, and of course the fate of the world is at stake. But the real horror of this book, is that the \\"symbol\\" and the secrets are banal and boring. It's easy to guess what's coming at almost any given time, but you keep hoping you're wrong and there's a huge twist awaiting you. Alas, at the end, all I could think of is, \\"What's the point?\\"    Da Vinci Code is  a hard act to follow, but you can follow it better than this.
0385504225|2.0|First there was \\"Angels and Demons\\" (yes it came first in 2000), a novel by Dan Brown about Robert Langdon who is a professor of religious iconology and symbology at Harvard University. Langdon is called upon to stop a plot set in motion by the Illuminati to blow up the Vatican with something called antimatter that had been stolen from a high security research facility.          Starting in 2003, the world was bombarded with \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" This time, Robert Langdon went in search of The Holy Grail and along the way managed to upset The Knights Templar, The Priory of Sion and the Opus Dei. Somehow this book went on to sell over 80 million copies and contrary to popular belief it is NOT the #1 selling book of all time. In fact, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" outsold the \\"The Di Vinci Code\\" that year and Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" outsold it by at least 20 million copies. Websites and info pages have been updated to correct the statements that it was the #1 bestselling work of fiction of all time and is now being called \\"One of the most popular books of all time.\\"          Next came two weak movies based on the books and made out of order. They got mixed reviews from fans and critics alike and both were denounced by The Vatican. Yet the movies still managed to rake in huge chunks of change. While the books and movies are entertaining, even \\"Angels and Demons\\" costar Stellan Skarsgard had an issue with the writing stating, \\"I think Dan Brown is a terribly bad writer, but he has cliffhangers at the end of every chapter which makes you want to continue reading,\\" and stated that the script was significantly different from the book. \\"Angels and Demons\\", the better of Brown's work still underwent minor changes before future printings due to inaccuracies.     Now we have \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" Langdon is once again called upon to find something that is hidden in codes and buildings. Set in Washington D.C. and taking place over the courseof 12 hours, Langdon is trying to save his friend Peter Solomon because...are you ready?...Peter is a 33rd degree Freemason who has been kidnapped by a man covered in tattoos named Mal'akh. Mal'akh tells Robert that Peter knows the secret that would unlock the \\"word\\" that is an ancient source of power. Knowing that Peter gave part of the secret to Robert, Mal'akh tells Robert to unlock the Ancient Mysteries in exchange for Peter's life. In the meantime, Peter's sister Katherine is working on a top secret project in a pod (yes a pod) deep in a government building but Mal'akh is hell bent on destroying her too.      In the end, all is revealed; kind of. There are chases and explosions. There are symbols and monuments. There are hidden rooms, secret passageways, dead bodies, giant squids (I'm not kidding) and more importantly, there is $29.95 plus tax wasted unless you are a fan of predictable and poorly written fiction. Brown can weave an interesting story but fails in the actual execution of his ideas. I have yet to talk to a person who has read the book who didn't figure out Brown's \\"plot twist\\" before they were even half way finished with the book. There was no surprise, no real suspense and not much gusto to the story. It's starting to look like Brown may be better suited writing children's books rather than adult novels. Maybe his 1993 self titled pop music album makes up for these books, but I doubt it.     Brown's promotional website states that puzzles are present on the book jacket and you must decipher it in order to reveal the hidden message. Maybe the hidden message in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" will tell us why Brown is planning 12 more novels featuring Robert Langdon? If so, I'll figure it out so I can be ready to be disappointed again.
B0007939NO|4.0|This is the entertaining musical set in Scotland. The plot is pretty basic- a young American and his alcoholic friend want to go hiking in the highlands, and encounter a magic town which only appears once a year. Tommy (the hero) falls for a villager, and they spend time courting. The villager's sister is going to be married, and the two Americans are invited. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes, and a young scorned suitor (Harry Beaton), decides to leave the village which would break the miracle which protects the village and curse everyone.<br /><br />I have long liked this film, although, there are several musical numbers that I could do with out as they are protracted and overly sentimental. I think the costuming is beautiful, as are the voices of the singers. As with most musicals... The plot isn't terribly deep... Don't expect an explanation as why people can emigrate to Brigadoon (for instance) and yet disatisfied people may never leave, or why a village of supposedly God-fearing people are so afraid of Witches. It seems the easy answer to their problems would be to run the witches out of town. What reason to make the entire village disappear?<br /><br />I've always sympathized with Harry Beacham as the scorned 'other man.' It seems cruel that he must be trapped in Brigadoon, against his will and forced to watch his love marry.<br /><br />4 stars. Beautiul singing, excellent sets, nice acting... But not particularly deep.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|The intent of the Florentine fathers of the opera was to compliment theater with music in order to enhance the dramatic impact of the action the story conveys. Over time, opera goers have been thrilled by gifted singers of enormous vocal power, but not alaways experiencing acting to match the voice. There are several excellent DVDs of Lucia D L, but this one is special. The entire cast combines singing and acting to perfection, and the emotional impact is powerful. It would be unfair to single out any of the principals, for they all sing and act beyond what someone is accustomed to. The mad scene and the end of the last act will always remind us what \\"Grand\\" opera is all about. This DVD is a must for any opera fanatic looking for a perfect fit of singing and acting.

0385504225|1.0|This book is a piece of crap and shame on Dan Brown for subjecting his fans to such innane, ludicrous drivel for over 450 pages. Not only are the characters wooden and devoid of any human qualities, but the story just goes on and on ad naseum about finding God and the Ancient Mysteries. Brown just keeps repeating the same old cliche's and tries to support it with fancy words and puzzles and geek-speak that leaves the reader feeling they are just reading bits and pieces of a dictionary or encyclopedia. And Brown just keeps piling on the useless scientific and philosophical stuff without regard for the reader's interest in that crap. And then trying to tie it in to the main story, which is full of holes.     What is it exactly that we are supposed to find at the end of this long, twisted, bloody journey? Mal'akh makes Bin Laden look like Santa Clause. There is no redemption or passion or anything uplifting about this book. After slogging through 400 pages I was ready to throw it in the trash. And what the hell is Noetics?. Brown needs to go back to college and take creative writing 101. But he's probably laughing all the way to the bank. I'll never read another one of his books.
0385341008|4.0|I had heard a good deal of gushing from friends in regard to the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  I finally got to pick it up and finished it in two nights.  Lovable characters and some heart-wrenching moments!  I like the way it was written through letters.  The epistolary-style did not get old due to how caught up I became in the character's stories.
159102594X|5.0|I'm not going to talk about what is in the book, enough people have done that - but I will say it's a must read.  I found it to be kinda like a blue collar Terry Goodkind book.  Magic, bad guys, good guys, but cut out the assumed 'Royalty has all the fun and wins all the wars' of a lot other types of books.    I didn't find myself 'hooked' on the first few chapters, just really wanted to see what was going to happen next.  If I set it down for too long, say 2 days, my mind wouldn't stop going back to the characters.  What was going to happen to them?  Why does she like him?  DOES she like him?  Am I ever going to like him?  Or her?  Is he going to win the contest?  Is that other crazy girl going to kill everyone before/ or after she gets herself killed - and WHY is she so crazy?    Then the surprise ending with LOGAN! OMG!  It's been a few weeks since I finished the book and haven't found the time to get the next one ordered so the characters have been preying on my mind.  I highly recommend this book.
B0029O08WA|4.0|I really do love the New Moon soundtrack. I think it fits great with the story line of the book. Mellow, sad, ....its not supposed to be a happy movie so I was very pleased.
1582406723|5.0|One minute you have a family and the next you have two shoes an a lot of ground to cover. Fortunately, they say they have stopped it on Street X, so you want to go there and let someone handle it. The only thing is that people don't seem to handle the undead very well. That's the world we find our main characters in, and one that we find constantly evolving. From friends to betrayals to teethmarks and other wornderful signs that the world is falling apart, we can see what is happening through the eyes of a few people. And we can see how the dead are only part of the problem and how death might be a good thing considering how much strain simply living puts on people. What a world - I wish films covered this topic anywhere near what we get from looking inside a few issues of gathered information.<br /><br />When this started out, I admit i was skeptical but excited. I had seen a lot of series come and go, and I had seen many with nothing to really offer. Then Waking Dead came along and, now into the 10th edition, I admit I'm hooked. There is the immediate storyline that has me and my need to keep up with what is happening to our group of survivors today, and how many of them might make it out alive. I also like the ever-shifting terrain and the fact that the living have to keep on keeping on in order to live - not to mention to keep from hurting one another. Plus there is the artwork, fantastic stuff, and the atmosphere that leaves the shambling heap of social order in a little bit of a pickle. O, and the zombies - they always look sexy, too.<br /><br />If you want a story that deals with the dead but explores the world around survivors and zombies alike, then this is a great series. For anyone who has ever picked up a horror story and thought about the love of teeth and betrayal, this will make you happy. It really has few shortcomings, and even those are minor glitches in a much larger pond. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B00000AF98|4.0|Crazy Nights album shows KISS as a New Wave band of the 80´s doing very well. Although Simmons was not focused on the band, songs like \\"Hell or High-Water\\" and \\"Good girl gone bad\\" would remark his style on album.    Stanley as always impeccable in vocals, Kulick define style and expertise to record the powerful solos of \\"No, No, No\\" and \\"Turn on the Night\\". If you liked the 80's with Tear for Fears, Warrant, you should buy this CD!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood is a wonderful Dr.Who spin-off. A more mature look at the world of Doctor Who, accompanied by Torchwood Three, a group of five interesting people that's humorous, funny, sexy, and down right awesome. If you're not the type of person that's looking to simply criticize something, then you should defiantly check it out. It is for older viewers, but as the episodes progress the levels of violence, language, and sexuality majorly go down.<br /><br /> Hope you enjoy!
B001W63DX2|4.0|I had the opportunity to see the IRON MAIDEN´S movie in cinema, and I don´t hesitate a second to pre order it on Amazon!!    The quality of the documentary is amazing and I like it because it does print the personality of each member of the band and their manager!    Just one more thing: in the booklet which reads Dickinson's notes on the tour, said he enjoyed the Chilean pisco. I'm glad IRON MAIDEN came to Peru in 2009 and I hope that Dickinson might have taken a PISCO SOUR and check THAT ONLY ORIGINAL PISCO IS FROM PERU!!!!!!!!
B0029O08WA|3.0|Its ok. I really liked the music better from Twilight. I guess I have to see the movie to make a better judgement to see what seens they used the songs on. I do listen to it. It is ok.
B000001ELR|4.0|After the failure of Music from the Elder, KISS needed a great return, and succeeded with CREATURES OF THE NIGHT. The best pieces of 80's rockers song from KISS you'll often find in this album.    Paul Stanley shows a great improvement in his singing and Simmons´songs hook you quickly. Also, the incredible sound of the drummer Eric Carr. This album is essential in your KISS Colection!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I will tell you that I was really scared purchasing this dvd set after reading several negative reviews. Common sense then dawned on me. Amazon and other major retailers are NOT going to sell us a substandard dvd! No retailer would get away with that. I am happy to say that my instinct was right. This collection is by far one of the best video collections ever made and for the perfect LOW price. The 2 disc set is in beautiful picture quality as well as crisp audio (there are two different audio settings so select the one that works for you) and I'm watching it on a 42\\" HDTV tv set that is less than a year old. I really don't know if the reviewers are smoking something funny or if they are just out to sabotage Madonna's sales.<br /><br />As listed, we are getting 47 of her music videos...ALMOST her entire collection so far in her career. \\"Drowned World\\", \\"Bad Girl\\", \\"Oh Father\\" are left out BUT are still available on her Immaculate Collection and Greatest Hits 1993 to 1999 dvd collections. These are still available to purchase so it makes good business sense to give people a reason to purchase older dvds. Unfortunately \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" (special feature for \\"A League Of Their Own\\" film) and the original version of \\"American Life\\" are unavailable to us here but that would be the only MINOR flaws of this collection. Don't be afraid to buy this. Please ignore these people. I think they have been brainwashed by the \\"High definition\\" industry by believing everything is below standard when in reality, its just as great as it ever was.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the first season was a mid-season replacement, with only 10 episodes, and it did not start as strong as it is in the current second season. There is much to like about this show. The family scenes really humanize the main character, who would be a bit of a jerk otherwise. His relationship with his daughter is one of the best on tv currently.     I really like the fact that this series does not fall into the problem most mysteries have had in the past, such as Murder, She Wrote. There is a reason this non-professional is involved in the crime solving rather than having people get murdered wherever he goes. Also, the victims are interesting, because at first you do not really care that much about them, but as you learn more, you gain more sympathy for them and start to really want the killer to be caught. This is also different from some mysteries where the victim is someone you could picture as having many enemies so there would be more suspects.     The writing is good, and the acting is great, as you really come to see these characters as real people. I hope the series continues for a long time to come, as long as they keep the quality up. I am glad that the second season will be a full 22 episodes.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Shame on the record company for allowing Bob Dylan to be exposed to ridicule. For many years now Mr. Dylan's voice has been incapable of giving anything other then the merest hint of competence. Now with the release of an album meant to reach beyond his most loyal fan base the awful reality can no longer be avoided. For years no one has had the nerve or sense to say \\"no\\" to this icon either because of Dylan's own vanity or blatant exploitation of his name. It's time to save whatever is left of Mr. Dylan's reputation, even if he can't or won't. Shame on all those involved in destroying this artists reputation.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|Once is one of my favorite movies and I didn't even know this was coming out. Picked it up at Starbucks and love it even more than the movie soundtrack. Just fantastic.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|loved it
B002SJIO5E|2.0|This movie was overrated. I think the biggest hype pusher was the fact that Peter Jackson had anything to do with it. \\"Peter Jackson Presents\\" is what you saw at the movie theater trailers and and the beginning on the dvd. He neither wrote nor directed it. I'll just lay out what sucked in this movie:  CGI   The aliens (I mean come on, if they are so intelligent, why are they so obsessed with rummaging through garbage and getting cat food? They resembled ghetto slum people, not an intelligent alien race...)  The shaky camera work. It strained my eyes really bad. I wish they stopped with that.  It didn't feel like it was making any sense most of the time. Cloverfield is what they were aiming for here...
0393325172|5.0|Patrick O'Brian writes in a fluid, rich fashion that rewards the patient reader with perception, inflection, and reflection.  He certainly builds his plot on adventure and the hardship of the British naval adventures in the Napoleonic era, but the reader who enjoys his stories best is the reader who appreciates understanding what is inferred and what is left unsaid.  I thought this book, the first in the series, introduced Jack and Stephan very colorfully and happily, but over the course of the rest of the series a reader will be rewarded with much more knowledge of them, and surprised by the development of their characters.  Loved this book, loved the Sophie, appreciated the tension that grew and dissipated among the characters.  It is all completely believable and enjoyable.
0385341008|5.0|I loved reading this book and getting to know the characters.  I would reccomend it to anyone who loves history and stories about enduring friendships with a dash of romance.

B002NXSRX4|1.0|Due to the great success from parlaying their Transformers toy line and various animated series' into box office gold, it was only a matter of time before toymaker Hasbro decided to try their luck with yet another of their long-standing toy brands, namely G.I. Joe. However, unlike the overwhelming sense of excitement I had when I saw the various trailers for both of the \\"Transformers\\" films, not to mention the actual films themselves; those heralding the forthcoming release of \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" were severely underwhelming to say the least. Despite a low amount of interest in the movie, I did finally get around to seeing it recently. Not surprisingly, much like my reaction to the film's trailers which were steeped in great disappointment; the actual experience of the movie itself was nothing short of an utter disaster, just on a much bigger scale than even I had anticipated.    \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" is essentially summed up by the title. Basically, an evil organization known as Cobra is attempting to become one of the deadliest terrorist cells on the planet. After a dangerous new weapon falls into Cobra's hands the world has only one hope for survival...G.I. Joe. A powerful covert military group, G.I. Joe is comprised of the very best operatives this world has ever seen, and when all else fails, they don't.    Well, whenever a movie is this unabashedly bad the number of complaints that one can level against it can be quite staggering. Don't worry, I'll do my best to not bore you by listing every single one of them, but I will touch upon numerous problems along the way. So, the best thing to do is to just start at the backbone for the movie's failures... the story.    The screenplay from writers Stuart Beattie (\\"30 Days of Night\\") and David Elliot & Paul Lovett (\\"Four Brothers\\"), all of whom have written far better films than this one, goes wrong in almost every way imaginable. Since the troubled areas for this movie's story are virtually all-encompassing, one could easily surmise that the writers never wanted to pen the movie in the first place. To be honest, if someone did have that thought (which I did), I don't honestly believe you would be that far from the truth.    For a movie based on a continually successful toy line and an animated series that shaped many a child of the 80's, I was extremely disappointed in the paint by numbers approach the story took. The entire film felt like the writers were simply ticking off items on a checklist; for example, working in numerous classic lines of dialogue from the animated series (which sound extremely cheesy nowadays)... check, vehicles... check, iconic characters... check, and borrowing ideas from movies ten times better than this one... check. The problem with this approach is that none of it ever gelled in a natural fashion; instead, it all felt shoe-horned into the story to meet some sort of quota of G.I. Joe references and affiliations. Honestly, if more time had been spent on polishing up the dialogue, building up character development, and creating an actually interesting plot, then perhaps \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" could have been an entertaining movie, or at least had the potential to be one.    The cast for this film was sub-par at best, which is sad when you realize that it was comprised of several very talented actors and actresses. Together this assemblage of assorted talents should have been able to offer up something better than what was put up on the screen, regardless of the irredeemable script. However, the majority of the cast members' performances felt stilted and uninspired, which by no means elevated the movie's already low entertainment value.    Then there's the fact that I found myself surprised by certain actors' presence in a movie so obviously inferior to some of their previous films. For those that are curious, the cast members I was most disappointed in were Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who has proven himself to be quite the talentedactor with intensely dramatic roles in films such as \\"The Lookout\\"), Dennis Quaid (who apparently was in dire need of a paycheck is my guess), and Channing Tatum (whose role in \\"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\\" earned him critical notice at Sundance Film Festival). These three actors, and a few others I didn't mention, all should have known better than to sign on to this movie. To make matters worse, most of the cast members, including the aforementioned, have signed for sequels, so they are stuck for the foreseeable future in what looks to be a horribly ill-conceived franchise.    On the other hand, some of the other cast members I wasn't as disappointed in, for various reasons. Comedian and actor Marlon Wayans (\\"Scary Movie\\") does his level best to provide as many comedic moments in the movie as humanly possible, most likely in some doomed attempt to distract from the idiocy occurring everywhere else in the film. The problems with Marlon's character of Ripcord were numerous, but a couple of them would be the fact that his humor fell flat almost 90% of the time and the only real similarity this incarnation shares with his animated counterpart is the fact that he's an accomplished pilot. The reason Marlon didn't disappoint me was because I had no real expectations for him. I mean, consider his body of work, there's not much there to really be proud of, in my opinion.    As for the actresses in the film, Sienna Miller (\\"Stardust\\") and Rachel Nichols (\\"Star Trek\\") added very little to the story other than the obvious eye candy for the predominantly male audience. I can say this about the two female leads, while their performances weren't impressive, they did excel in the aforementioned area that their presence was geared towards from the get-go. So at least in that respect, they did not disappoint either.    Lastly, Ray Park's character of Snake Eyes was the sole member of the cast of characters that I was actually intrigued by. What makes this kind of humorous tome is the fact that he is never given any lines to speak; which is probably what allowed him to remain interesting. I almost feel sorry for Ray Park, because yet again his prowess with weapons and martial arts are the only reasons he was even included in the cast (other examples of this would be \\"Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"). If this were the silent era of films the man could be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood rather than a glorified stuntman. You know, if the acting gigs ever dry up, perhaps he should consider becoming a mime. Then if someone didn't pay enough attention to him he could beat the snot out of them. Seems like a plausible scenario to me.    Even though my expectations for this film were low from the very beginning, I thought that at least the movie's visual effects would stand some chance of impressing me. My belief that because the film was being directed by Stephen Sommers (\\"The Mummy\\"), that the movie's effects would be solid throughout was completely misplaced. I knew that from the previews a few of the scenes looked a little on the weaker side, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the off-chance that perhaps these were early cuts of the scenes that hadn't been fully finished at the time. However, shortly into my viewing of this movie I became well aware that much like the rest of the experience; the CGI would also prove to be an area of extreme weakness.    The film utilized multiple effects houses, as is often the case with big budget blockbusters, so pinpointing one effects house as the source of the film's visual shortcomings is difficult. However, from what I can gather, it does appear that Digital Domain has been tagged as being responsible for the lion's share of the work in the film. That being the case, I feel it's only fair for me to hold them accountable for the majority of the abhorrently bad visual effects.    What makes this failure on the part of Digital Domain even more shocking, in mymind, is the fact that their body of work has been downright stunning in past films. For example, they took part in some of the recent summer blockbusters; such as \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\". So, my question Digital Domain is this, \\"What went so horribly wrong with your work on this film?\\" One visual effects trouble-spot was whenever CGI stunt doubles were being used. The lack of weight in their movements made them stand out like a sore thumb, and left me frustrated with just how unrealistic they appeared. Other problematic areas would be most of the shots involving various G.I. Joe or Cobra vehicles in action or completely CGI created set pieces that lacked any sense of realism. What this all boils down to is that almost every single visual effects shot in this film looked shoddy, and in my opinion there is just no excuse for this to be allowed given the capabilities we see on display in movies these days.    So, what did I take away from this experience? Not a whole lot, aside from a newfound understanding of just how ridiculous some of those classic lines from the animated series really were or that the name G.I. Joe makes me laugh due to how comical it sounds. But seriously, this movie is a poor excuse for a summer blockbuster, and the fact that it can't even qualify as a guilty pleasure speaks volumes to just how horrible this movie is.    \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B0000X2DMA|5.0|I deeply enjoyed this album and can't wait to get another.  The composition of the entire album has an interesting balanced between the majestic and the animal.  Gonna be a hard one to beat for any band.
0451530454|4.0|The introduction is expansive and insightful. This edition has a few additional stories, which gives it something more than similar texts. My only complaint is the physical book itself, which is a small, tough little bulldog of a paperback. It's nothing out of the ordinary for a cheap paperback, I'm merely remarking on my frustration with the thing.
B002V0WN2K|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this album when I bought it. The album starts with a highly energetic \\"We weren't meant to follow\\" and has some really good tracks that follow. I have listened to it a few times now and it feel like they have gone back to their roots with this album after flirting with the Country scene with \\"Lost Highway\\". I am glad that they are back to their rocking self in this one and am very happy with the purchase. This by no means their best work but a solid effort nevertheless. \\"Love's The Only Rule\\", \\"Thorn In My Side\\" & \\"When We Were Beautiful\\"  are pretty impressive tracks in this album apart from the opening rock anthem.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Perfect Work they did :) image its Fantastic!! quality is amazing !     Worth every cent
B000002IST|3.0|'We Can't Dance' has copped alot of harsh criticism from Genesis fans over the years, with the usual lines trotted out about it being a Phil Collins solo album in disguise. It's (mostly) unfair, because the best parts of the album are more reminiscent of their traditional approach than anything they did since 'Duke'. Unfortunately, this constitutes only about half of the songs, with the rest being some of Genesis' most uninspired and bland music. It seems the band themselves knew this, because the album is almost totally front-loaded; very good first half, very ordinary second half.    Songs such as 'Driving The Last Spike', 'Dreaming While You Sleep' and (to an extent) 'No Son Of Mine', although not truly prog-rock, do return to the more complex, detailed storytelling of the band's heyday. The former in particular is an extremely under-rated song, probably because it isn't prog enough for the die-hards, but too long for the pop fans. 'Jesus He Knows Me' and 'I Can't Dance' continue the trend of slightly humourous and biting pop-rock the band perfected on Shapes and 'Invisible Touch'. Both of these have strong melodies and hooks, suitably satirical lyrics, and a few innovations in their production and execution. All good so far.    But after this, the album starts losing the plot, descending into a series of lacklustre ballads and mid-tempo social commentary-type songs; not \\"bad\\", but MUCH more like Phil Collins solo tracks than true Genesis tunes. 'Hold On My Heart' is even more insipid than 'In Too Deep', and while 'Tell Me Why' and 'Way Of The World' have their hearts in the right place, they don't hold a candle next to previous protests like 'Land Of Confusion' or 'Domino'. I've never really bought into that \\"Phil Collins stuffed it all up\\" mentality, but those that do might find some ammunition in the second half of the album. Thankfully, things do get back on track with the last song 'Fading Lights', another extended piece that is the most clearly prog song here, featuring some outstanding keyboard and drum work in the middle section.    It's hard to really know what to make of 'We Can't Dance', since I've never before heard an album that starts off so well and decline so drastically. The best moments of the album probably do outweigh the bad songs, and it does contain some of their most well-known singles. But, gee, that second half is a real let down.     Five stars for the first half and 'Fading Lights', but one star for the rest. So three for the album overall.
0786868724|5.0|Wow, another phenomenal story by Mitch Albom. I couldn't put the book down, only when I had to and finished it in 24 hours. It will touch your heart, bring you to tears, spontaneous chuckles and everyone should go out and buy 10 copies and give them as gifts.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I was able to see this movie before it came out.  Not only did I dislike the movie (for those of you who don't know, Jacob character accidentally kills one of Bella's friends which is NOT in the book!)  In addition, I was looking forward to hearing the songs in the movie because I love most of these artists.  To my surprise there was not ONE song from the soundtrack in the movie.  There is a scene where the lead singer of Death Cab for Cutie walks behind the vampires and says, \\"hey do you guys know where I can kind a soccer ball to bit the hell out of? You see, I'm also a vampire but I want to bite soccer balls instead of people.\\"  But that is the only thing even remotely close to the soundtrack.  We don't see Ben Gibbard (the lead singer of Death Cab) for the rest of the movie, but I hear he plays a huge part in the next one.      There is music in the movie of course, but it is all just stupid songs that the main actor wrote on his piano.  They don't have any words accept one in which he just yells, \\"why why why, why why why, oh my goodness gracious!!\\" Which I found to be way too dramatic and over the top.  Sorry to say this, but I don't think anyone is going to like this movie and certainly no one will like the, \\"soundtrack\\".  My advice is just to watch the movie before reading the book and just buy this soundtrack and pretend the songs are on here.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I like many other reviewers here, did not see the movie based on professional critical reviews which characterized the film as just a violent gross out based on the \\"underground boxing clubs\\" founded by the main characters. I accidentally saw part of the movie on cable and am very glad I did.<br /><br />The fight clubs and any violence associated with them are very ancillary to the main story. The thought provoking story can be viewed many different ways, but one theme that keeps recurring is that of the cult of the fight clubs. The cult of personality that stems from the founders, the blind faith of the followers and how what starts out as essentially a good thing, as the originators find new lives removed from materialism, takes a dark twist and the death of a member is considered a sacrifice for the cause. It could be the tale of almost any religious journey as principles are sacrificed to fanaticism. Whether you choose to seek this or other allegorical interpretations of the film, it is enjoyable on many levels, not the least of which is the story of the Narrator and his descent into madness and redemption.<br /><br />The vehicle which propels the movie (the relationship between the Narrator and Tyler) will be the subject of some discussion as the vehicle that carried the movie \\"Memento\\" was and is. Can you suspend a little disbelief in order to fully enjoy this movie on repeated viewings? I can. Even knowing the major plot twist, I have enjoyed it many times since. It is a great film and further, stands as a great adaptation of the book. Even the author thought the adaptation added to original. I can even say for full disclosure, that I was not a fan of Brad Pitt or Helena Bonham Carter before this film but their performances in these roles are probably the best of their careers. They were really well cast and the feeling is that Director David Fincher really got them to bring the original characters alive on the screen. Ed Norton in his portrayal of the Narrator, is a perfect foil to Pitt's Tyler Durden.<br /><br />Please enjoy Fight Club. Rent it, own it, read it or some combination of the three. Just take some time to think about Fight Club's central question: Are you a unique snowflake?ect foil to Pitt's Tyler Durden.     Please enjoy Fight Club.

B002MW50KO|5.0|So Bob Dylan covers a bunch of Christmas standards. But whup, right?    I'd disagree.  This is one of those recordings that demonstrates that Dylan *can* sing - despite his gravelly, aging voice.     I've always liked Dylan's voices (plural intended). In a way, he sings like Neil Young plays guitar - he might take you somewhere unexpected, but always lands on the right note.    Dylan's vocal abilities are evident on all his recordings, but three in particular, come to mind, especially if you want to demonstrate for a skeptic:    \\"Nashville Skyline.\\" The rumor is that Bob had taken a break from smoking - and voice lessons.      \\"Dylan.\\" This is an older, relatively unknown album on which Dylan covers others' songs - and proves he can croon with the best of them.    \\"Good as I Been to You.\\"  Just Bob and an acoustic guitar - solidly reestablishing his creds on both vocals and guitar.    \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" is a must have for any Dylan collector, but it's something else, too:    Aren't you already dreading the weeks after Thanksgiving and before Christmas when all the music around you is insipid old stuff you've heard thousands of times?  This is Christmas music with some real spice; you can have fun with Christmas music again.
1594202249|1.0|If this were not a Pynchon novel, no publisher would have printed it. It is filled with anachronisms and prescient references that no one would have made at the time. Police use computers -- admittedly antique ones -- to get information in a way that didn't become common for decades -- and at the urging of the protagonist.  ARPAnet, forerunner of the internet, is discussed as if everyone knows about it and it didn't even make an appearance in real life until 1969. It was an unlikely contender for survival but pynchon's characters ballyhoo it.    There are unsexy sex scenes and characters who make brief appearances but don't have any resolution of their reason for being there.    Save your time and money because pynchon has wasted his.
0545123267|2.0|The cover is gorgeous, yes, and the concept of an all-werewolf book is intriguing, yes.   And that's it.    The worst thing about Shiver was the romance. It's extremely bland and blind. I get it that Sam saved Grace when she was a child, but HELLO? Grace loved Sam as a wolf, not as a human, considering she never knew him as a human. Loving the wolf that saved you is understandable, but loving it as you would romantically love a human being? I'm going to be lenient and say, for the sake of argument, that their love is real and not teenage obsession. How are you going to account for their instant lovey-dovey? I mean, even if they have some kind of love connection, they don't really even know each other. Seriously, think about it. Even if Sam was always looking at Grace, his werewolf memories are hazy and he admits not even remembering her name. If we say Sam watched her in his human form, well, that doesn't mean he really knows her either. As for Grace, she only knew Sam as a werewolf. And you know what? Grace herself admits she's obsessed. And she is. It's like Bella and Edward, except (and I'm not even a Twilight fan) boring.   It's all very disappointing because Shiver has nothing going for it (plot-wise) except the romance, and the romance itself is not believable or interesting.    The plot? There are so many plot holes and the main conflict is ridiculous. Characters come up but then they don't even have anything significant to contribute.    Something really laughable was the lack of parents. The fact that they're not attentive seemed like a total cop-out so Sam and Grace didn't have to deal with parents. If Grace's parents are like that, at least give us a really good reason, or something. She doesn't care her parents are like that, and it's just... they're not fleshed-out at all.    Overall, very disappointing. She opted for instant, obsessive love with no believability, instead of something really fleshed-out. The plot is so ridiculous you can't even call ita plot. There are so many cop-outs in this book.. wow just honestly, save yourself money and don't buy this book. If you're really curious, get it from your local library.
B001QXE0OC|4.0|This is probably one of the best albums from a Disney star. Great dance songs that are catered to teens: falling in love and dissing all the dumb guys out there. Great ballads that showcase her voice (I Promise You is amazing). Also, this has a variety of styles (pure dance songs like Fallling Down, pure pop ballads like I Got U, and even 80's throwback for those inclined like I Don't Miss U at All). So get this album if you're a pop or dance fan.
B000002LHX|5.0|I think one of Prince's best songs is \\"Electric Chair.\\" Incredible guitar riffs, and I can never get sick of it! I also like \\"Partyman\\" and \\"Trust.\\" The lyrics to \\"Lemon Crush\\" are not that great (If I was  working at my jobba', i'm the victim, your the robba..\\") but it's still a fun Prince song. The only song I do not particarly care for is \\"The Future.\\" This soundtrack will remind you of the movie, and take you back to 1989...the songs here still sound as good today as they did back then, you won't be disapointed!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|I loved this movie, when I left the theatre, I was absolutely convinced that this was the best movie.. ever.<br /><br />Now that I have had some time to think about the subject, I am not quite as excited about it, but still thouroughly impressed.<br /><br />This movie is not your classic sci-fi. It is more of a political movie with some aspects of exploring the human mind, and there are aliens too, so why not try to explore their minds as well? There is absolutely NO comparison to movies like serenity, which is more of your classic story with introductions, climaxes, and resolutions, so it might take a little getting used to if thats what you are expecting.<br /><br />Many people rated it low because of language, adult themes, gore, shakey camera etc. I was actually suprised to realize that none of it really bothered me. I think that the main reason is that most of it was relevant for the image the director was trying to portray (except, perhaps, one or two exploding humans). Additionally, this movie made no attempt to glorify any of it, just point out how weird people can be especially when they are placed in crappy situations. I don't entirely agree with the opinions presented in the movie, but did not find any of the views presented to outlandish (people can be very gross and mean, its sad, but true). I think this movie was supposed to be a realistic (for lack of a better word, perhaps pessimistic realism would work better) sci-fi, which dosn't happen very often in hollywood, so I commend the effort.<br /><br />I did not think that any of the characters were underdeveloped. But I could see how some people could think that, because the movie did not go out of the way to explain the characters, you just sort of have to figure it out. I thought the acting was good enough that I was able to watch the characters think and evolve without feeling like any particular behavior was out of place (even of the aliens).
B000002AH9|4.0|When listening to this record please keep in mind that these songs are some of Holiday's last recordings and were done so with the songstress in less than optimal health.  With that said, this album is far superior to \\"The Last Recordings\\" where Holiday's voice is so damaged and reduced that listening to it is almost painful.  Here, the tone and quality of her voice are diminished but not the power of emotion which she was and is still famous for.  \\"Lady in Satin\\" is a study in contrast with Billie Holidays life-weary voice slicing through lush and nearly magical backing instrumentation.  While some may shake their heads and feel sad for this beloved songstress nearing her final curtain call, I instead took away a new respect.  Clearly she approached this project knowing that she was not at her best but still she decided to tackle some of the most demanding material of her career.  With everything working against her, she still managed to produce a fine album that cuts straight to the heart.  Whatever she may lack in honeyed tones and sweet melodies, she more than makes up for with raw emotion and sheer determination.  What you hear here is an authentic moment.  There is a smattering of love, a healthy heaping of pain, and pounds of memory and regret. Every emotion that one can feel is somehow embodied in these wrenching tributes to life.  Standout tracks for me are \\"I'm A Fool To Want You\\", \\"But Beautiful\\", \\"I'll Be Around\\" and \\"The End of a Love Affair\\".  But truly, there are no bad tracks on this album.  There are singers now in the prime of their lives and mantles covered in awards that can't produce such a powerful and touching array of songs.  Holidays vocals are like broken glass and the supporting music is like fine diamonds.  At the end of the day both sparkle and shine.
B00005T7I1|5.0|This movie is like a violent combination of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Toys.  I think Disney had something to do with its production from all that stuff I saw at Disney MGM Studios Themepark back in the early 90's, but I just can't imagine Disney being involved with anything this violent.  Not even five minutes into the movie, and we see a bunch of mobsters gunned down.<br /><br />While most of the movie's features are quite average, the visuals are so incredible that I feel the need to rate the movie outstanding as a whole. From set design, to costumes, to make-up, it is one of the most artistic or maybe even the most artistic big budget movie I've seen.  Everything is in bright wonderful colors, even ordinary factory machinery.<br /><br />This is probably one of the last visually stunning movies to be made before the whole CGI computer special effects era.  Jurassic Park came out three years later, and it seems like every big blockbuster afterward was absolutely saturated with computer special effects.  Dick Tracy might very well represent the pinnacle of movie visuals without these effects.  I doubt you'll ever see another movie like it in the future.
B002BE7JEI|5.0|Everybody knows the movie,so I just want to review the BD quality.PQ is absolutely fantastic throughout 1hour and 44 minutes,but curiously the last 3 minutes are not on the same level,I guess it's on the original print,sound quality is impressive ,you can buy this BD with confidence and throw away your old Standard dvd just like I did.
0385504225|2.0|Like all great and good fic­tion, the dance between truth and the lie is quite a del­i­cate one.  In the hands of a mas­ter, it's Swan Lake, but in the hands of a rank ama­teur, it's noth­ing more than prom night.  Dan Brown's The Di Vinci Code was Swan, no ques­tion about it, for its intri­cate plot - although lin­ear, as any good thriller must be - evolved as the secrets of the Church, both true and oth­er­wise, were revealed.  The end result was some­thing of an hereto­fore undis­cov­ered pro­mul­ga­tion of the Vatican.<br /><br />By com­par­i­son, The Lost Sym­bol is, indeed, the fum­blings of the prom night set.  Its plot attempts to cap­ture that mag­i­cal dance Di Vinci had but fails, dis­mally, because the pro­tag­o­nist, Robert Lang­don, is lit­tle more than a foil for the oft cliche secret world of Peter Solomon.  Solomon, bil­lion­aire phil­an­thropist as well as the high­est rank­ing mem­ber of the Masons, is cap­tured by the antag­o­nist.  Mal'akh is a bor­der­line between human and mon­ster whose life­long quest for the tal­is­man he believes will open the gate­way to the secrets his sur­vival requires; of course, the gate­way pro­vides for his demise, the clas­sic - if not stock - sce­nario of his arche­type.  But Mal'akh's sur­vival is not at the expense of the pro­tag­o­nist (Lang­don), as it should be, but at Peter Solomon's, which only fur­ther enhances Langdon's pro­saicism.  While Brown attempts the dance he so beau­ti­fully exe­cuted through his pro­tag­o­nist in Di Vinci, Sym­bol's Robert Lang­don plays the dis­be­liev­ing fool whose organic intel­lect hap­haz­ardly car­ries him through the plot to a rather unsat­is­fy­ing (and unrea­son­able) end.  Sim­ply put, the Robert Lang­don of Sym­bol is the idiot brother of Di Vinci's Robert Langdon.<br /><br />Brown is so sur­pris­ingly inept at his craft in this novel that all of his char­ac­ters - save one - are reduced to vapid, homog­e­nized stereo­types.  We can, for exam­ple, see the zip­per of his mon­ster; Mal'akh has all of the vibrato of Franken­stein with­out any of the solic­i­tous empa­thy.  Kather­ine Solomon, Peter Solomon's sis­ter and famous Noetic sci­en­tist, is equally as impo­tent as Lang­don, him­self; instead of being Langdon's trusty side­kick where her knowl­edge of Noetic sci­ence is able to pro­vide cer­tain cru­cial answers that Langdon's field of sym­bol­ogy can­not, both she and her world of Noetic sci­ence remains to the end a com­plete mystery.<br /><br />The only gen­uine char­ac­ter in the novel is Sato, the dwarfish troll, chain-smoking direc­tor of CIA Oper­a­tions who is the only clear patch in the oth­er­wise hyper­bolic sto­ry­line.  Here, Brown gets it right - almost.  With Sato, Brown cre­ates a believ­ably unre­li­able char­ac­ter; the reader is some­what con­cerned which side she's really play­ing.  But it's all for naught as the book is really noth­ing more than a sym­bol of failure.id, homog­e­nized stereo­types.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've always loved Star Trek from when I was a small child to now, I'm 40. I watched the original, saw all the old movies multiple times, all of The Next Generation and some of the other series too. I even used to build model kits of the Enterprise. However, I don't go to the conventions and dress up or belong to some nerd club. Having said all that, I thought Star Trek 2009 was awesome! From the beginning to the end. Great effects, great story. Of course, I would have done a few things a little differently, I might have left out the alternate time line, but it might make for some interesting movies in the future. I'm buying this one when it's released.
1407109421|5.0|My friend let me borrow The Golden Compass but didn't have the other two in the trilogy when I was dying to read it. I finally caved and bought the trilogy because I couldn't wait any longer! Unlike some authors who write sequels and 3rd, 4th, or 5th books just because they're trying to ride out their fame with their first novel, Pullman definitely delivers with all three of the books. They are all beautifully written and incredibly engaging, for both children and adults. At first I felt embarrassed to read a children's novel, but after a chapter or so, I quickly discovered that the book had universal appeal. Pullman has such a wonderful imagination and manages to surprise you all the time throughout the three novels. The characters were infuriating at times, but I quickly reminded myself that he was writing about pre-teens so that explained the juvenile personalities who sometimes acted like mature adults. The trilogy was about loss, friendship, respect, love, betrayal, faith, etc.<br /><br />Many critics of this book argue that it's deeply anti-Christian. I disagree. I think the book was simply extolling the importance of independent thinking. It was a story plot that taught that we are capable of good even without being religious, and that destinies don't exist because we can make our own futures. It was an uplifting, imaginative story. For children, the story on the surface will be fun enough. For adults, it's definitely interesting to be able to read between the lines and see a deeper meaning to the story than what one might read into it at first.
B00005OAA6|5.0|I bought it because I love one of the songs but the whole album is great. If it came out now I think it would be a big hit.
B001TODCII|3.0|White slavers, high speed chases, torture, explosions, dead bodies ... you just can't ask for more from gay Paree!<br /><br />The plot is simple. An ex-CIA agent's airhead daughter decides to take an innocent trip to Paris and gets herself into a mess of trouble. (Dad knew all along that it was a bad idea, but do they ever listen?) True to Dad's completely reasonable expectations, the daughter and her equally brainless girlfriend are immediately abducted by Albanian white slavers. Due to his CIA connections, Dad figures out who the slavers are in about three minutes, which gives you a whole hour to watch him kick, gouge, electrocute, shoot, and, in general, beat the living daylights out of the rest of the cast. Eventually, Dad finds the Arab sheik who has bought the silly girl for an outrageous (and totally unwarranted) amount of money, and there is a touching reunion--after Dad shoots the sheik. Then the happy pair fly back to California where a pop singer-<br /><br />Hold on! Now wait just a cotton-picking minute! What about all the OTHER girls who were abducted while trying to get a taxi in Paris? Did Liam Neeson just leave them to their fate? Didn't some of them have well-to-do parents who might have kicked up a fuss? What about the \\"hundreds\\" of Albanian slave traders? I'm pretty sure Liam Neeson only killed... let me see...thirty or forty of them. How did he get on a plane after shooting all those people? Don't they have police in Paris?<br /><br />OK, so it's an action flick. We can ignore all those little details. But the one thing you really can't get around is the fact that no way does a father rescue his daughter from white slavers in Paris without saying, \\"I told you so.\\"
6300213005|5.0|I grew up watching Robocop. Just one of those awesome production films that are not too full of it. The whole 1-3 videos. I still remember the video games and all from Robocop in the early 90s if i'm  correct. Plan on buying the DVD, can't wait to see it in a digital format so to speak. Then they offer it on Blu Ray which is prolly amazing... my main point, Robocop is a Sci Fi thriller like no other that you will never get tired of.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|When it came in the case was in excellent condition and the film has no bad functions
B002BFIN6K|1.0|One dislikes to strike the negative note, but this is a terrible recording.  It's a pity that it's not been suppressed.     There is not a moment of naturalness, of the characteristic golden tone, just a vintage Steinway that sounds, strangely, like a mediocre Asian piano.    AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE AND WARN YOUR FRIENDS.
0316010669|4.0|This book is a great read.  Very engaging and thoughtful.  The author provides some wonderful new insights into how we make decisions from the gut or at the blink of an eye.  From this insight you can start making more intelligent decisions on how you take advantage of your instincts.    My only complaint and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the author doesn't give enough definitive advice about what we can do to better ourselves with the knowledge he provides.  There are suggestions and hints but any conclusion is a little weak.  Regardless, I have read this book twice and will read it again so I can continue to understand my own gut instincts and make better decisions in the blink of an eye.    If you enjoy this book, check out Emotional Intelligence.  Although a little dry, Emotional Intelligence reflects some of the points made by Malcolm Gladwell in Blink.
0316096199|4.0|It was very good, although a little too graphic in details for it to be an appropriate read for teenagers. It was a good conversation starter. My husband read it, too.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|Awesome, from start to finish. Highlights include If I should fall from grace with god, thousands are sailing, broad majestic shannon, irish rover and Turkish song of the damned. More than just those songs this album is a beautiful fusion of traditional irish folk and punk. In my opinion, the best of Shane MacGowan, and the best of The Pogues.

I'm not sure how to approach what was revealed because it didn't seem to answer my concerns.  The prayers at the bottom of each card are nice but I too would like to have seen more meanings/explanations.

I guarantee ya! Plus, I sorta kindly like all them green alien gals. Wish I had two or six of them dancin' around the room when I wake up every mornin'. Fellers, you know what I'm sayin'! I just wish Carrie Underwood would dress up like one of these women of Captin Kirk's. That's the good stuff and hoss, that's the only language I understand. Go get this one and add it to the rest of yer stuff.

B000FSME1A|5.0|The is the best pick for all Apocalypse Now fans, whether they be new ones, old ones, or are simply rediscovering this classic historical fictional account of the Vietnam War.  It's all here: the original 1979 version, the 2001 redux, commentary by Director Francis Ford Coppola, special features, scene selection, multi-languge subtitles, etc.    Interestingly, the best scene (in my opinion) was not included in the original version.  This is called the \\"French Plantation.\\"  This scene is so good that I must have watched it a dozen times.  Apparently, it was edited out of the 1979 original version, for unclear reasons, but possibly just to limit the sheer length of this film.  It is indeed a long film, but every minute is well done and fascinating.  The French Plantation scene reappears in the 2001 redux version.  \\"The Complete Dossier\\" is a good buy just for this scene alone.  It explores many of the controversial issues surrounding whether or not the US should have been involved in the Vietnam War, the role of the Viet Cong,the Russians, the North Vietnamese, the South Vietnamese, and, most importantly, the Americans.    Great quotations from the movie: \\"charging murder here is like giving out speeding tickets at the Indianpolis 500.\\"  \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning: that gasoline smell...it smells like..........victory!\\"  \\"Horror and moral terror are our friends: if they aren't, they are certainly enemies to be feared.\\"  \\"Charlie don't surf.\\"  \\"There are two of you: one that loves, and one that kills.\\"    At times horrifying. At times funny.  Always thought provoking and interesting.  One cannot understand the Vietnam War is one has not seen this movie.  Buy it.  Watch it -- more than once.  You won't be disappointed.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|If brain-dead characters, awful narration, predictable plot points, and really, REALLY bad writing add up to your idea of a good film, then waste no time in renting \\"Wanted.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, if you want to see an intelligent, well-made film that's based on a graphic novel, try \\"Watchmen,\\" \\"Road to Perdition,\\" \\"Sin City,\\" or \\"Ghost World.\\"<br /><br />Jolie, Freeman, and McAvoy should have their acting licenses revoked for signing onto this repulsive dreck.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|After the first song, John proclaims \\"tonight we just wanna rock-n-roll and have a good time\\". That is exactly was this DVD is. John has surrounded himself with an amazing band ignited by Kenny Aronoff on drums. I saw this tour twice. The first time was at a casino and it was just the band's second show together. The sound was awful(the guys in the band were gesturing all night to the crew) and the staff forced everyone to sit down during the show. The second time was during the summer at an outdoor amphitheater. The band was much tighter and the crowd sang and danced all night. There are some phenomenal jams on this DVD with Commotion, Ramble Tamble and Keep on Chooglin'. The band's sound has a strong country flavor to it with the addition of Jason Mowery on fiddle, mandolin and steel guitar. The versions of My Toot Toot, Southern Streamline & Blue Ridge Mountain Blues are tremendous. The core of the band with Billy Burnette(guitar), Hunter Perrin(guitar), Matt Nolen(keyboards), David Santos(bass) and Aronoff create freight train of sound that will give any set of speakers a work out, especially on Old Man Down the Road and Fortunate Son. Many of the traditional CCR tunes have a harder edge to them and are played at a faster pace than the studio recordings. Just put it on and try to sit still while you watch it....you can't. John's guitar work is smooth as always. He seems to get better with age.<br /><br />The DVD is very stripped down. No bonus tracks, no interviews. It was also supposed to be out LAST Christmas(according to John's website). Why it took so long I don't know. But, it was worth the wait. ENJOY!!!!
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I have tried this product both on Debian GNU/Linux and on Windows XP.  It was detected (without having to load a module) and usable on linux immediately.  I used it with gpsd without a problem.  In Windows, however, I was disappointed that I needed the disk to install the virtual serial port.  I was really hoping that it would be generic enough that I could use it on any computer without having to haul around a driver disk.  Still, this product was intended to work on a Linux box with gpsd, so it won't affect me.
0756405890|5.0|This was the best fantasy novel I have read in years.  I cannot wait for the sequel.  The plot is engrossing and the prose is delicious.  I read it once, then a month later re-read it cover to cover.  Bravo Rothfuss!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson has fans all over the world.  So many people for years have endeared themselves to him.  The fans vary from young to old.  There are young kids today who are just beginning to become familiar with his music.  This film may help many to understand, at an even deeper level, why he's the iconic pop star whom many love and adore.<br /><br />However, if anything can be said about Michael Jackson, it is that he transcended his music.  Oh, there is no doubt that he was a master entertainer, dancer, and composer of some of the most incredible songs written in the modern era.  Despite being all of these things, what is most amazing and enduring, is the man himself.  And \\"This Is It\\" gives us an incredible glimpse into who Michael Jackson really was.<br /><br />Michael Jackson has often been described as a quiet, loving man who loved the planet and all those around him.  Some people, I'm sure, have scoffed at this notion.  Watch \\"This Is It,\\" and you just might change your perception.<br /><br />I find it almost haunting and a bit of foreshadowing, when during a press conference, Michael tells everyone, \\"This is my final curtain call.  This is it.\\"  On some level, I wonder if he might have known something.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps he was simply talking about his career as a performer.  However, a few people have told me that they found this statement of his a bit eerie.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Michael felt right at home on stage, performing for thousands of people.  He is into every facet of the show, from lighting to sound to choreography, to musical play.  This is a true artist at work; an artist who is, without question, a master of his craft.  Like watching a composer, Michael orchestrates everything.  He knows when something isn't quite right, and there were a number of times during this film where he tells someone, \\"That isn't quite right.\\"  I have a musical ear, but definitely not like Michael's, because half the time, I couldn't tell what was wrong.  But it doesn't matter what I think. He's the artist, and it's so much fun to watch this master artist at work.<br /><br />It seemed that every time there was music playing, whether it was someone practicing on their keyboard or guitar, Michael's body immediately sprang into a series of dance movements.  Music was life to him.  It was like someone flipped a switch, and he would begin moving, even if it was just tapping his leg.<br /><br />I think one aspect of Michael's character that was shown, was that he never got angry with anyone.  He never got upset or even so much as raised his voice at someone.  Instead we hear nothing but encouraging words, \\"God bless you,\\" he often said.  \\"Don't worry, we'll get there.\\"  \\"This is why we rehearse.  It will all work.\\"  I can see why people loved working for the man.  He was a perfectionist, to be sure, but then what artist isn't?  But instead of losing his cool or getting upset, he instead worked with everyone.  In many ways, this aspect really offered insight into the type of man that Michael Jackson was, a man who loved people and tried to always treat them with the utmost level of respect.<br /><br />The film also offers insight into Michael's music.  I can't think of many other pop stars who have written such a body of work that actually has something to say.  Michael wanted his music to have more than a pleasurable impact.  He wanted people to think about the planet, other people, and ultimately, themselves.  I found it interesting that during his concert tours, he often ended his concerts with his most powerful songs...\\"Heal the World,\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror.\\"<br /><br />Add to these two songs another provocative piece, \\"Earth Song.\\"  There is a segment in this film where Michael has some new video footage to add to the piece.  I won't disclose the details here, for anyone who has not yet seen this film, because I feel it's important to experience it without knowing about it.  However, if this segment does not touch your heart, give you chills, and get your eyes watering, then perhaps you'd better check your pulse!<br /><br />For many reasons, Michael Jackson will never be gone to us.  I'll lay odds that people will still be listening to his music 100 years from now, just as people still listen to Mozart or Bach or Beethoven, and they will wonder who this person is.  Those who really have some insight into the man that Michael Jackson was, will be able to tell others that Michael Jackson was a man who loved music, loved the planet, and loved people.<br /><br />This isn't it, Michael, it's just the beginning!ering, then perhaps you'd better check your pulse!

B002KREVCO|4.0|I bought it and its great - HOWEVER, I kept hearing in the press that it was suppose to be a 1 watt 'working' amp, as in it actually turns on and functions. That appears not to be true, unless only certain retailers get that version, which I have not heard.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|When the long-awaited adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' comic book masterpiece Watchmen was released, it proved to be, despite its flaws, undoubtedly the best adaptation that a fan of the comic could have ever hoped for. Those who found it boring, overlong, or just simply didn't \\"get it\\" need not apply here for this Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut edition, which pushes Zack Snyder's adaptation to a 3 and a half hour plus epic. Fully incorporating the animated Tales of the Black Freighter (intercut into segments) as well as deleted scenes from the first DVD and Blu-Ray releases of the film, Watchmen: The Ultimate Edition is a masterpiece of comic book to film adaptations that will not disappoint those who have long cherished the comic. The special features, which include commentary tracks from Snyder and Gibbons, as well as the brilliant Under the Hood segment, the various webisodes, and the Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic, are worthwhile enough (though one may wish that more would and could have been included features wise), and as for the film itself, the same flaws do remain: including the various alterations in the story (such as Rorschach's origin and the ending), and the fact that the film just isn't for everyone or those expecting to see guys in tights fighting the good fight. Despite its flaws though, the Watchmen film remains a labor of love that does Moore and Gibbons' masterwork, and now that it's in its complete form, is more than worth your time.

B00278U1W0|4.0|Excelent concert both in content and picture quality. The audio was also pretty good even though it was just your basic DTS.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I'm glad I bought this CD for several reasons.  First, the sound of the remastered versions of these songs is fantastic.  That was obvious the minute I put it in my stereo.  Second, I loved the small hardcover book that the CDs are packaged in - it's a great memento if you enjoyed the movie. Third, the demo of She's Out of My Life is just beautiful.  Fourth, it's the only way to buy the song This Is It.     When you consider that the cost of seeing the movie was about the same price as this two-set CD and book, I think it is well worth the price.  For those that were disappointed that this was not the actual soundtrack to the movie, I think those versions of the songs would have sounded very rough and pieced together. Perhaps not something MJ, as a perfectionist, would have wanted released on a CD.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Disney is one studio that takes its time and carefully manages its releases. Partly, this is to create demand for titles with the expectation that they'll only be available for a limited time before \\"going back to the vault\\". And part of that wait is to do things right, and that clearly is the case with the Blu-ray release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.<br /><br />One thing that Disney did NOT do is over-restore this classic animated film. The Blu-ray restoration is as close as you'll get to the original presentation (in fact, maybe better given projector limitations in 1937 when it was released). What you see is every detail of the beautiful hand-drawn, hand-colored animation cels, and the watercolor backgrounds. And, Disney was equally accurate in its audio restoration - the 7.1 channel track does not over-process or attempt to create surround sound where it didn't exist originally. Rather, you get a clean room-filling presentation mostly from the front 3 channels.<br /><br />In a nice touch that more studios should do, Disney is also including the DVD version of the movie in the packaging. Alas, there is no Digital Copy for your computer (eg. iTunes) or portable media device (eg. iPod).<br /><br />And, many of the extras are Blu-ray restored as well. (Silly Symphonies in HD!)<br /><br />What could be improved?<br />- well, sadly, this release is missing a few extras from the 2001 DVD, most notably a 40-minute interview with Angela Lansbury<br />- navigation of the extras buried in the Hyperion Studio Tour requires you to navigate in and out of rooms<br />- BD-Live content (once again) is lacking - who wants to wait 5 minutes to see more theatrical trailers you could see online on your computer?<br /><br />But none of these areas of improvement could take away from a stellar, true-to-the-original restoration of a timeless classic.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I had this movie on VHS for years and years and it was one of those films that I just never got sick of.  And then when dvd's came out, I eventually threw it away thinking 'I'll go and get it on dvd now'... and off course it hadn't been released on dvd.  So this was a great find for me - and is still just as enjoyable today as it was 20 odd years ago.  A great movie, a great adventure, fabulous for the kids and the special effects were cutting edge at the time and still hold up today.  The special features on this special edition are fanastic too - educational as well as interesting.    10 out of 10 from me!

0385504225|1.0|I guess sometimes a writer only has one or two good books in him.  Sadly, this seems to be the case with Dan Brown.  His protagonist is a narrow minded know it all who, after being proven wrong hundreds of times in three books, still believes he knows everything.  I suspect Mr. Langdon is a reflection of Mr. Brown.  None of his \\"shocking\\" revelations were shocking; any avid readers of mysteries will figure it out in the first one hundred pages (which could have been nicely completed in fifty pages).    But mostly I was annoyed by his incessant use of cliched phrases; I'm a pretty old guy, and my world has never spun out of control, I've never had a blinding flash of clarity, and, oh well, you get the idea.    I confess I only scanned the last fifty or sixty pages, reading the first and last sentence on each page, and that was more than enough.  It has been a wile since I was so disappointed by a book, or so glad to be done with it.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Didn't really hear too much about this movie over the summer except for the few times I've seen it advertised in theaters. I decided to rent this and watch it with my girlfriend, it was really an unexpected great piece of work. Fantastic acting and a great thriller story line.  I was shocked to see that it had mixed reviews from the \\"establishment\\" Kinda makes you wonder, right?  Anyway, great flick.

055380684X|1.0|(This is a long review because there's a lot to say about this book--none of it good.)<br /><br /> The premise of The Talent Code is straightforward. Myelin is a neurological substance that wraps itself around  neurons that are specifically engaged when we learn and practice skills The thicker the sheath of myelin around these neurons, the more hardwired and precise these skills become. The Talent Code examines  teaching/learning methods that ostensibly hasten and maximize the process of myelin wrapping thereby radically increasing our ability to acquire, polish and hardwire complex skills quickly and efficiently. This, Coyle claims, is the key to greatness in sports, music and (possibly) academic learning.<br /><br />Coyle attempts to illustrate and prove this theory with anecdotal rather than scientific evidence (although he often refers to scientific studies on myelin to validate his observations) that he has gleaned from his visits to \\"hotbeds of talent\\", as he calls them, around the globe where learning methods that stimulate myelin  wrapping are used, producing (in a few cases anyway) inordinate numbers of exceptional athletes and musicians.<br /><br />It's an interesting premise but Coyle's exploration of it is riddled with errors,fallacies, unproven claims, poor research, puzzling semantics and old ideas and concepts from other sources that Coyle has cobbled together and presented as cutting edge information. These problems are evident right out of the gate when Coyle presents his  dumbed down description of the part myelin plays in skill acquisition and shows just how shaky his grasp of his subject is. Yes, myelin is important in the learning process but it's controlled and regulated by the neurochemical BDNF. This compound is regulated by the nucleus basilis, which is the part of the brain responsible for deep concentration and other processes pertaining to skill acquisition. But Coyle mentions neither BDNF nor the nucleus basilis though they are at least as important as myelin in this process.  This is like describing the miracle of how letters end up in a mail box without mentioning the postal worker who puts them  there or the post office that sorts the mail and sends it to the right address. (I would have given this book two stars just for a decent description of the myelin wrapping process but Coyle can't even get that right.)<br /><br />After his botched description of the neurological process that is largely the basis of his book, the author moves on to discuss various learning/teaching concepts that he claims maximizes the myelin wrapping process. He presents these concepts as though they're groundbreaking and revolutionary discoveries: secret knowledge he has fetched from obscure sources and shared with us for our edification. Nothing could be further from the truth because while Coyle does his best to present these ideas as new and original by dressing up old concepts with new labels and jargon, they are all familiar and common place to anybody with even a passing knowledge of contemporary teaching and learning methods.<br /><br />Take the specific practice method that Coyle claims maximizes myelin wrapping. This method involves breaking a skill down into small components and slowly perfecting each component before moving on to the next. Mistakes are focused on and eliminated through repetition. Coyle calls this process \\"deep practice\\" and  asserts that it's a cutting edge concept known to and practiced by only a privileged few. But this method of practicing has long been common practice among serious musicians and athletes, and not just in his so called \\"hotbeds of talent\\"-- most of which have been previously documented in other books and magazine articles. Further, as other reviewers of this book have complained, Coyle never gives a step by step overview of \\"deep practice\\" strategies, which are outlined in many other books on the subject. He also never distinguishes between \\"practicing\\" and \\"learning\\", often using them interchangeably, which gives the impression that he actually believes that they're the same thing.<br /><br />He goes on to reveal to us that good teachers--whom Coyle refers to as \\"master coaches\\" -- focus on a student's individual strengths and weaknesses and balance perceptive, constructive criticism with sincere compliments in their approach to teaching. This is a basic tenet of effective teaching but Coyle treats it like news of the discovery of a second moon orbiting Earth.<br /><br />Then there's the  startling revelation that students who are motivated through a deep interest in a particular subject tend to master that subject  more quickly than those are lack motivation. Coyle calls this \\"ignition\\" rather than motivation because he is either intent on reinventing the wheel linguistically speaking or renames basic concepts in order to give his premise some semblance of originality  Is anybody really surprised to learn that inspired students  who jump into their studies with great passion nurtured by good teachers tend to do better than those who are apathetic about their studies? However much Coyle would have us believe otherwise, this observation is about as newsworthy as \\"dog bites man\\".<br /><br />Coyle relies heavily on unsubstantiated conclusions and fallacies to support his premise.  For example, he raves about a private school whose main goal to  instill (\\"ignite\\"?) in its students an obsessive desire to go to college. He spends many pages enthusing about how wonderful and successful this school is in realizing this goal. But wait a minute. How many of these kids have actually reached college? Not one because the program is only a few years old and the kids haven't even reached high school yet. So we have no idea how well it does or doesn't work. But Coyle concludes that it's a wild success and bases his conclusion on...well, actually, he never says. (He also never says how these children, most of whom come from low income homes, are going to pay the tuition for the university of their choice)  He's just sure it works like a hot damn: no proof needed beyond his completely subjective enthusiasm for the school and it's approach.  Then there's Coyle's claim that one of his alleged \\"hotbeds of talent\\",  Meadow Mount Music Camp,  \\"produced\\" Yo Yo Ma and Izhtak Perlman. This is pure rubbish.  Both musicians received only an infinitesimal  part of their many years of intensive music training at this 7 week camp. And what about the thousands of other musicians who attended MM? Are they as great as Perlman? Coyle tends to avoid addressing questions like this. He also makes much of the amount of myelin found in Einsten's brain but never explains how this relates to his premise. Are we meant to assume that \\"deep practice\\" was responsible for Einstein's genius and the large amount of myelin in his brain?  True to form, Coyle doesn't say directly but of course we're supposed to infer the connection. In fact, although Coyle implies several times that  \\"deep practice\\" of  academic pursuits can lead to  greatness, he steadfastly skirts the issue of how this might be done and offers no evidence that it may be possible. The reader has to take it on blind faith that it's so.  The book is full of this sort of transparently fallacious content that is indicative of the worst kind of shabby, shallow pop journalism.<br /><br />Even Coyle's notion of what constitutes \\"greatness\\" is highly questionable.  Let's say that his premise is right, that if we spend 10,000 hours of \\"deep practice\\" at a particular activity, we will acquire incredible technical skills. (The \\"10,000 hours of practice\\" theory which Coyle refers to constantly is the hypothesis of Dr. KA Ericcson whom Coyle doesn't credit in the body of the book although he does in the bibliography.)  Let's say we spend these 10,000 hours practicing music and develop phenomenal technical music skills that allow us to perfectly navigate a difficult piece of music at warpspeed. Is this greatness? No, it's an impressive feat to be sure. But it isn't greatness and no knowledgeable musician would ever say it was. Great musicians--all great artists for that matter--aren't just about technical skill. They have other crucial aptitudes--creative intelligence, sensitivity, emotional expression, imagination, a penchant for original thought and risk taking, etc.--that don't develop simply by spending endless hours repeating the same movements over and over until mistakes are eliminated and the myelin sheath enveloping their neurons is as thick as Mike Tyson's forearm.  What does Coyle make of the fact that many principal violinists in major orchestras have the same (or greater) technical skills as celebrated violin virtuoso Joshua Bell but will never achieve his greatness because they don't possess the aforementioned qualities that move a technically excellent performer into the realm of true greatness, which Bell inhabits? And how would he explain the greatness of artists like Picasso, Van Gogh, Kandinski, Maria Kallas, Bob Dylan, Frank Lloyd Wright or countless other true greats whose brilliance had little or nothing  to do with technique and everything to do with original thought and creative expression?  That Coyle never addresses this conundrum indicates that the arts in general is a realm far beyond his ken.<br /><br />For Coyle, fame and fortune are the most important indicators of what is truly great  For example, he gushes on endlessly about the brilliance of Jessica Williams' (yes!) vocal teacher who has managed to get several of her students on Pop Idol by  enabling them to sound like everybody else in the genre and gain recognition in a world that celebrates and rewards mediocrity and formula.  Not that becoming an entrant on Pop Idol is any small feat: it requires some talent and work. It just has nothing to do with greatness. The same could be said for The Talent Code itself, a book that is the literary equivalent of Pop Idol: while some serious work went into writing it, it's derivative (as hard as he tries, Coyle is no Malcolm Gladwell), mediocre and  shallow--slickly designed and  marketed to sell a prodigious number of units to hopeful consumers who infer from the title that the book contains precepts that will lead them to greatness. Much is promised: little or nothing of substance is actually delivered. Coyle is simply shilling the kind of power of positive thinking pap that has become an enormous American sub-industry by trying to sell the absurd idea that anyone can become another Einstein or Beethoven or Tiger Woods or, heaven forbid, Jessica Williams, if they'll just plunk down 20 bucks for fluff like The Talent Code.<br /><br />The concepts presented in The Talent Code as revelatory jaw dropping epiphanies are nothing more than facets of a time honored, well worn truism: seek out sincere experienced instructors who believe in you, work hard, practice regularly, patiently and carefully with discipline and passion and as your skills improve, consistently aim higher. You'll unquestionably improve, attain at least some level of mastery in your area and perhaps even excel. It's ever been and always will be thus, (long before myelin was discovered). Will these things alone make you one of the greats? No, because true greatness involves many attributes that can't always be gained through tens (or hundreds) of thousands of hours of practice or instruction from the greatest teachers.  But they'll  get you a lot further than reading this compilation of second hand, poorly communicated ideas, cliches and unsupported claims marketed as original earth shattering insights and wrapped in sloppily presented scientific semi-truths to give it the facade of legitimacy.<br /><br />If you're looking for well-written, helpful books on how we learn most effectively and what part the brain plays in the process of skill acquisition ,skip this mess and try The Practicing Mind, The Brain That Changes Itself, The Art of Practicing, The Outliers, This is Your Brain on Music, Practice Made Perfect, Effortless Mastery by the great jazz pianist Kenny Werner who actually presents detailed strategies for effective practicing, This is Your Brain on Music etc.  All of these books contain far more insightful perspectives on how we learn most effectively than the Talent Code and none have the arrogance to suggest that they have some simplistic formula or \\"Code\\"  for attaining greatness like this dud does.sure.

Each of the tracks is a winner (with the arguable exception of Phil Spector's crazily over-the-top production on the last track, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\"), and they're presented chronologically so you hear how the group's sound evolved. Unfortunately for your wallet, chances are you'll find yourself thinking of other Beatles tunes that didn't hit No. 1 in the U.S. or U.K. and feel compelled to seek them out on CD as well.

B0000542D2|5.0|Don't expect linear storytelling or a documentary, per se. This film offers a little of both. There's a loose plot in which the Beatles, who have become prisoners of their fame, try to break free and have a bit of fun, much to their manager's vexation. (Each of the Beatles gets at least one delightful little scene in which to shine except, curiously, for Paul McCartney; his \\"mixer\\" of a grandfather, played memorably by Wilfrid Brambell, is his surrogate in mischief.) There's all kinds of droll merriment along the way, with some of the Beatles' hits incorporated cleverly, but the real payoff is an extended concert scene at the end. Just a note -- some of the accents, most notably George Harrison's, can be challenging; try watching with the subtitles on.
B001OQCV24|5.0|Is what I say to describe this film. It is the type of film to be seen in a theatre then enjoyed for years later at home.  The special effects are absolutely breathtaking and awesome. I loved The Day After Tomorrow and 2010 takes it to the next level. It is about the complete destruction of the world. Unlike the '70's disaster films, which I still love, that featured all star casts; pre CGI special effects- (some laughable by today standards but very good for it's day), some even Academy Award winning for it's special effects (Earthquake). Todays disaster films feature known stars but focus on a few main characters and then many, many extras....To see all the places we know be destroyed and then later on to be washed away by tsunamis will leave your heart pounding. The arks that are used to save folks and take them away in the waters are soooo cool.     The characters, actors of course take a back sit to the effects but are still hold there own. John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, George Segal and Oliver Platt are all good.  So is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who I had never heard of before. Danny Glover, who never seems to  age, is the President (the second disaster film to have a black president, the first was Deep Impact with Morgan Freeman)    But when it's all said and done it comes back again to the special effects. I take my hat off to director Roland Emmerich for another great disaster film. He adds that to his credits along with the disaster/end of the word hits Independence Day and one of my fave movies The Day After Tomorrow. I can not believe he is the same director that gave us the turkey, the  awful Godzilla remake(Jurassic Park creatures) but hey, everyone is entitled to one mistake. And wtih Tomorrow and 2012 coming after that he has redeemed himself.
B001OQCV24|3.0|So, when the world ends, it's the politicians and bureaucrats that we're gonna save, and the writers and the artists and the spiritual leaders are left behind to deal with the apocalypse. That was the most depressing element of the movie. What will the world look like if we only save the \\"important people\\" in Washington? Heaven help us. Seriously. If the future world is to be populated with the slimy-dog politicians and their ilk, I think I'll take my chances with eternal life, thank you very much.<br /><br />Sitting in the darkened theater watching 2012, I was reminded of \\"The Bunker\\" at White Sulphur Springs (in West Virginia). Construction on the 110,000-square-foot bunker was started under Eisenhower's watch, when we were worried that the USSR might blow us up into lots of radioactive pieces. Turns out, our beloved elected officials were prepared to push The Red Button that'd end the world as we know it, and then turn-tail and run into their bunker, slam the blast-proof door behind them and emerge 90 days later when the danger had passed. And the most amazing part: The Bunker is outfitted with gee-whiz features that'd lead the unsuspecting public to believe the lawmakers were still comfortably ensconced in Washington, DC. In other words, The Bunker was *designed* to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.<br /><br />Watching \\"2012\\" I thought about The Bunker and realized, this movie is probably right. If and when the world ends, it'll be the politically important that are given seats on the lifeboats. And it's probably right that if there is a cataclysmic event, the Powers That Be will not tell the unwashed masses what's going on, lest they try and steal one of those seats on the lifeboat.<br /><br />That's just depressing on so many levels.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />This movie is definitely impressive on the big screen, and the soundtrack has plenty of bass (which I like). But the script and the writing was a little sappy for my tastes. And as to believability - well - this movie fell short on that score, too. I don't want to spoil the plot, but NO ONE can drive a limousine *that* well. On the plus side, the graphics are truly amazing and scarier than anything I've ever seen before. I had to turn away from the screen to avoid some of the scary-as-hell images. It's a pretty intense flick, and it does a good job of drawing you in.<br /><br />A nice side effect: After watching this movie, I'm a lot less worried about getting those pesky credit cards paid off. Does make you think a little more about enjoying every day, and appreciating the simple beauty in our world.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's an interesting flick with awe-inspiring graphics, and it'll hold your attention - if you can suspend disbelief for a couple hours.ell short on that score, too.

0634089358|5.0|I have been playing guitar and bass for around three years now. A couple of years ago, I bought a different instructional Blues bass book/ CD and found it to be uninspiring. The songs were kind of dry, and although there was good information, it seemed to be more aimed at educating a complete beginner, with a little more emphasis on theory.    Hal Leonards' Blues Bass leans more towards teaching you to perform, without a whole lot of theory.  There are several full length Blues songs, such as Stevie Ray Vaughn's \\"Pride and Joy.\\"  But what I really loved was the many, many examples of different turnarounds, intros, endings, and bass patterns for you to creatively use. There are also examples of \\"stops\\", \\"kicks\\", and chromatic moves to use when transitioning from one key pattern to the next. This really enables you to tastefully change things up in a song so it won't get boring or monotonous, without overdoing it.     Playing the CD made me feel as though I was outside some juke joint that had a swinging Blues band inside, getting down! I have learned a few of the patterns and I am confident that when I am through with this book, I will at least be able to give an entertaining, basic Blues Bass performance. The author, Ed Friedland did an excellent job with this one, and even did a good job on the guitar parts, which he played himself. I knew he was a great bass player, but I did not know he was a trained Blues guitar player, too. Well, it showed, and was on great display.

0765356139|4.0|Book Two.  [[ASIN:0765350386 The Final Empire (Mistborn, Book 1)]] is book one; read it first, before you even read this review.    They 'handled' the Lord Ruler and inherited his empire.  This book is how Vin and Elend deal with the civil wars fracturing the Final Empire while frantically trying to restore the basis of the economy, (Atrium) which is missing in action. It's darkish, less grandiose than the first, and has more of a 'lets stabilize as rulers' theme, as opposed to 'let's be audacious heroes.'  Expect angst/teen drama mid-book, because Vin and Elend are teens wrestling with the extraordinary responsibility of managing an empire, and they do make poor decisions.  The book is not as rogue-like as the first entry, and the plot becomes more byzantine.  Focus is also more distributed between characters; some secondary characters are done superficially (the crew).  Plenty of plot twists, and an ending that segues nicely into book three.    Less focus on Allomancy, more on political factions and world building.  Series went from pure action to political action, which I didn't mind, but you may not like. Mid-book pacing may bore readers, and romance between Vin and Elend is more a distraction than story focus, making it wooden and awkward.  Skip to around page 400 if it's too slow for you.  Personally, I found the magic system and world well drawn, and liked the novel.

I kind of felt obligated cos I told the library to buy it. So I read all 662 pages, and was not too happy about it.<br /><br />I am only giving it 3 stars because yes he he can write he and told a nice story. A great author who actually can write. If it wasn't for that fact I would grade it lower.<br /><br />Now what was wrong? 662 pages! But I have read longer books that I loved. I think it was the setting. It is just not my kind of fantasy. I want the epic, the big wars, the quest. This book was more about the man, and I could have cared less. I have read another book like this and with that one I could not bring myself to finish book 2. With this book, well perhaps I can force myself just I am gonna force myself with that other book.<br /><br />The story did not start good for me, Kvothe's childhood, and it did nothing for me. It did get a bit better when he began university and started learning things and some magic. But something was lacking for me, and I would just read Harry Potter. Truth to be told, I have trouble remembering how it ended.<br /><br />I also think Kvothe was somewhat of a Mary Sue. He is like the smartest person around and learn things in a day that takes years for others. He is a natural at everything, and I am sure in the next book when he learns how to fight he will learn it in an hour. People hate him with a passion or like him.<br /><br />But I do admit that Rothfuss has a way with words, he can write better than many authors out there. Others will surely love the story and find it intriguing. But it was not the fantasy for me, I go for other things.<br /><br />But do not listen to me, take a look for yourself. There are different sorts of fantasy and I just go for the high, and epic fantasy.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|While Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are billed as the main characters, the story actually centers around and is told from the perspective of a half white-half aboriginal boy named Nullah. He brings the lead characters to life, giving them purpose and heart. Of course, there are villains--no good story is complete without them--and they are a driving force behind the plot and storyline. But the life of the movie are the unlikely trio who find a family and sense of belonging with each other. However, I cannot quite make up my mind about this film. It really seemed like it was done by two different directors. The first half of the film was light, quirky and relied much too heavily on computer enhancements to naturally breathtaking landscapes. Through the entire first half of the film, I could not believe that this was the grand, dramatic epic that was raved about. But, over an hour into it, the picture finally hits its stride and becomes a sweeping epic--the characters gain depth, the story has heart and Australia comes to life. Overall, while the film most definitely could have been improved in the first half, it was worth sitting through and the almost three hours passed quickly.

B002LVVCIK|4.0|Controversial documentarian Michael Moore has taken on some important news topics over the past two decades but perhaps none has affected every American more than the financial meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 as depicted in Capitalism: A Love Story.  Done in his customary style of news clips, interviews, and enactments, he has fashioned a convincing indictment of greedy bank executives while being engaging and at times enlightening.     He points out a startling fact: We used to be one income family, Wall Street and corporate profits were guided by sound principles, and our country had no business competition.  It's a kind of history lesson courtesy of Moore as he also notes parallels between the demise of Wall Street and that of the Roman Empire, a comparison not without merit.      His thesis is that since President Ronald Reagan came into office, the influence of Wall Street has increased to the point that, while Congress and the U.S. Treasury have promoted financial deregulation, many of them have direct links to financial giants such as Goldman Sachs.  It would seem on surface to be a major conflict of interest, and that is the point.  A handful of CEO's have benefited from running the country as a corporation and costing millions of jobs and livelihoods.      Moore ties news stories to an increasing pattern of corporate greed.  There is a juvenile facility in Pennsylvania financed by taxpayer money and corrupt public officials.  There are college students beholden to banks with student loans, and we witness news reports of a recent plane crash in Buffalo, New York, for what appears to be the lack of funds for safety issues.  Then there is the surprising practice of businesses like Wal-Mart that take out life insurance policies on its employees and collecting on the benefits.  By contrast, he does show examples of companies owned by workers that operate efficiently and at a profit.  His point is there can be win-win situations.    As Wall Street sold `derivatives', a risky form of corporate gambling, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that Americans tap the equity in their homes, and thus came the refinance boom for banks and a new found wealth for the masses-or was it?  Using a home like a bank was a formula for financial disaster as the housing industry collapsed with foreclosures and the banking industry fell too.  Moore makes his point with footage of actual foreclosures as sheriffs evict homeowners, and the cruelty is not only losing a home but in the cottage industry that has taken advantage of this agonizing process.  Added to this is the preferential treatment that CEO's gave to each other and many lawmakers regarding mortgage approvals.  The question that keeps being asked by Moore and others is `where were the regulators' in all this?      As Congress debated on how to repair the economy with a bailout of as much as $700 billion of taxpayer money, Wall Street used media abetted fear to manipulate lawmakers.  It was a politics of fear.  But not everyone was buying into the fear.  Some members of Congress were brave enough to tell a sobering tale of a lack of oversight versus corporate bonuses being fed by the bailout.    Moore shows that some people are fighting back.  A new President (Obama) ushers in the potential for change.  People are fighting foreclosures and forcing banks to prove chain of title.  The laid off workers at Republic Doors refused to exit the factory, and with media coverage and a supportive President, Bank of America caves in and agrees to pay the workers what is owed to them.  This event is not without precedent as Moore points out in 1936, workers at a GM Flint, Michigan plant also fought back.  In an ironic, fascinating piece of history of what might have been, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed but never lived to see a second Bill of Rights which would address virtually every important concern for Americans including health care, education, and financial security.      Then Moore makes this observation based on a private corporate memo that says 1% of the population in this country has 95% of the wealth but that the other 99% have an equal vote and the power to make changes (yet still hope to be part of the rich).  It is this equal vote that scares the corporate powers.  His conclusion is that the only hope for this country is for democracy to work.      Some things don't come off well in the film; Moore appears to be grandstanding when he rents an armored car to make a citizen's arrest of the CEOs of Wall Street and get back the public's money.  He even takes crime scene tape to cordon off bank doors.  Also, an interview with actor Wallace Shawn seems a bit out of place. Wouldn't an interview with an industry insider have worked better?  You may not agree with everything Moore espouses, but some of the information should cause anyone to research the facts and draw their own conclusions.  If you are a fan of his previous films Sicko or Fahrenheit 9/11, then you will appreciate Capitalism: A Love Story.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I bought this USB turntable to copy decades-worth of LPs to my computer as AIFF files, then declick and convert to MP3s.  I'm no audiophile, but the ripped music sounds better to my ears than listening directly to LPs because of the noise reduction, and all the tonalities are there.  This Sony turntable is a real bargain for a little over a hundred bucks.
