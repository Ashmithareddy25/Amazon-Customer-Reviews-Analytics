B000002UAU|5.0|First of all, we all know that any discussion of the greatest band of all time starts and ends with the Beatles. Secondly, this was probably the most innovative album of all time when released (well, at least until the White Album). However, it seems to me that this album gets more credit for its influence and innovation than the actual quality of its music because it is here, in the actual songs (for me at least) that this album still manages to fall short of the Beatles' peak. Not at all to intimate that the collection of songs on here isnt spectacular, simply that the Beatles are so spectacular themselves that nit-picking is often necessary in order to even try to compare their 5 (i would actually argue 6 with MMT included) greatest albums, which in the end is probably a pointless gesture in and of itself. However, for me its that this record seems almost TOO perfect, if you know what i mean. It's that the songs work SO well together that it lacks any rawness and, often, energy. Not to mention \\"Within You Without You\\" is my least favorite and most tedious of all their sitar experimentations.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Yeah yeah yeah, all this was released before, and yeah yeah yeah, nothing new for real Gn'R fans, and yeah yeah yeah, the band didn't aprove it's release and yeah yeah yeah there are better Gn'R songs out there and many other bad things you can say about this album. None the less, if this is the first record you buy in your life, it's worth 5 stars. The product itself is great. <br />Great songs, Great attitude, amazing music, kick-ass lyrics, great singing, out of this world guitar riffs, awesome bass lines, good drums, all what you can always expect from Gn'R is here. <br />If you wanna know what real rock n' roll music is all about, well, needless to say you gotta get this album. In all honesty Appetite For Destruction is better all along, but none the less, you get a sample of all Gn'R's albums here. The raw and heavy feel of AFD, the feeling of Lies, the art and beauty of the USI I and II, and the attitude of TSI (which I don't know why people bash so much, is one of the most entertaining albums ever), and on top of that you even get a Rolling Stones cover which was never released before on a Gn'R record.  <br />All and All, not bad, could have being millions of times better, they could have even added real unreleased songs like \\"Crash Diet\\" and b-sides like \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" and even live recordings from their \\"Live Era 87-93\\" which would have made this record far more entertaining. None the less, it's a great introduction to Gn'R to new fans, who will be impressed to hear this band at it's \\"best\\"... <br />Highlights: it's Gn'R. <br />Lowlights: nothing new.
B000067J1H|5.0|Fight club is a psychological thriller with twists and turns a plenty.  This film is a stance on our societal status which is a poor state indeed.  Fight club is filled with dark humor, it is a cult classic and of course it is an anarchical view of our society.  Fight club is a great film, and I must recommend to any and all who are willing to watch <br />     Staring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, it is about a man's internal struggle that he pushes to his real world. His struggles with his self confidence, insomnia, and an addiction to self help groups slowly destroys what life he has (Norton).  This struggle is furthered by a slippery and sinister soap salesman(Pitt). The two men find them self's fighting as a ratical form of aggresion therapy and male bonding. Their idea of fighting groups catches on and \\"fight clubs\\" pop up all over the country.  These clubs lead to mad anarchical attacks on random targets all around town. All is well, or as well as it could be until an eccentric woman played by Helena Bonham Carter, gets in the way.  Her interference leads to a downward spiral into insanity, Violence and self realization. <br /> Fight club is filled with dark humor and a satirical view on our societies current state.  During the beginning of the two main characters relation ship Pitt's character ask, \\"Are we really men, in the hunter gatherer sense of the word?\\"  He goes on to explain to Norton's character that we have become a society of consumers and not a society of providers. This scene is culminated when they fight simply to relax out side of the bar they were in. <br />      This films strange point of view has built a fan following like many a film, however, this is one of a special breed. Fight club is a cult classic, it is the cream of the crop when it comes to movies.  Not simply for its ultra-violent happenings, but for its underlying anti-conformist tone and unique political stances is what makes fight club a cult film.  Through fight club we follow these two characters through there disturbed and perverse adventure towards rock bottom and eventually self realization. <br />        This is most assuredly not a film one would want the kids to see, Fight Club is a film respected and recommended by many a critic. With its dark humor, ultra-violent satire and cult following, fight club has the ability to stay on a \\"top movies of all time list\\".  Like many before and many that are sure to come after, Fight Club seems to point out and even accent our societies worst aspects, though unlike other films Fight Club shows these problems in a cartoon like manner.  Still a movie it is a movie all should see at least once, twice if they want to understand it all. <br />
B000002GK1|5.0|In 1991 Seattle would be introduced to the United States as the dominating force of music, it wasn't about wearing makeup or singing songs about love, it was real.  Badmotorfinger is what many Soundgarden fans consider to be their best album, it doesn't have the commercial appeal of \\"Superunknown\\" or \\"Down on the Upside\\" and Chris' voice was much more masculine than \\"Louder Than Love.\\" As much as this album has made a lasting impression on music it never achieved the success it deserved because the other two important albums of 1991 overshadowed this album, those two albums being \\"Ten\\" and \\"Nevermind.\\" With this album Soundgarden took a new approach, it doesn't have the arena rock sound or indie rock feel that previous Soundgarden albums had, Kim Thayil was heavily influenced by Sabbath and feedback at this point and it shows.  Ben Sheperd comes in and takes over for Hiro Yamamoto and shows more presence, Matt Cameron's drumming is in top condition, and of course we have Chris Cornell, maturing not only as a vocalist but as a songwriter.  Most people reading this review have heard this album anyways but to sum it up we have the 3 MTV popular/singles at the time, \\"Jesus Christ Pose,\\" \\"Outshined,\\" and \\"Rust Cage.\\" I had always shyed away from other songs because I felt that they were very metalesque and not creative, but I found so many gems that I had missed before; \\"Slaves and Bulldozers,\\" \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed,\\" and \\"Mind Riot\\" are standout tracks as well, I might dare say better than the MTV singles.  This is probably one of the heaviest albums by a non-metal band to come out but it was is so different to me, it wasn't aimed at a target audience, it was made for the sake of being made.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The ultiamte Green Day album :) <br /> <br />The songs are magnificient and I just can't stop listening to them. Damn that Jesus of Suburbia, Holidays and many more. GO buy this album NOW!! You won't be disappointed.
B000000OUE|5.0|Recently, while going over some records i havent listened to in quite some time i gave spin to \\"Astro Creep\\" again. Not that i expected it to be otherwise but i loved it just as I did almost a decade ago when i first heard it. White Zombie really reached their peak with this album and in doing so they created one of the top-10 metal albums of all time. <br /> <br />    Sure, a lot of water has flown in the river since then, loads of crossover bands released their music and even more metal bands tried, most unsuccessfully, to copy Zombie's music. Even when Rob Zombie went solo he didn't come close to reaching the stunning metal assault of this album.  <br /> <br />    White Zombie were incredibly daft when they released Astro Creep. Incorporating electronic beats and effects, some of which were downright techno was not exactly what the average metalhead was willing to swallow. But the blending of all the elements in a masterful way produced a mix that was instantaneously addictive. It got you banging along without a second thought. Actually, if this album wont get you moving i hardly see what will. <br /> <br />    The reason i consider this to be among the very best metal releases of all time is because of its boldness, its ferocity and its surreal grooviness. It's no accident that ten years later it sounds as fresh as ever and were it to be released today it would still make for a massive and a very influential rock album. <br /> <br />   Sometimes i think that White Zombie's masterpiece was in a way \\"lost\\" in the wave of grunge releases back then, especially when i consider that yes it didnt sell bad, but at the same time it still remains undiscovered -mysteriously so- by quite some music buffs even among the metal scene itself. <br /> <br />    A friend of mine claims about this album that it is the definitive album to listen to while driving.  She's probably right, allthough i could think many instances where Astro CReep would be a perfect fit. <br />   An adrenaline charge of the highest order if i ever heard one.
0006531407|5.0|This is an excellent book which teaches you how to survive if you are unfortunate enough to crash somewhere, get shipwrecked, be in the middle of a natural/terrorist disaster or are lost in the wilderness.  Whilst I doubt you would be able to remember all this info if ever in trouble, if you take this book with you if going on multiple days hikes, or have it ready in the vehicle in case of road block by fire, someone getting bitten by a spider/snake or terrorist attack with a chemical agent the you'll be in better shape.  This book is excellent to help you prepare for natural disasters but I think you would have to have it with you when deciding which plants are good to eat, animals poisonous and so on if lost in the outback or forest.  The handy colour sketches are good but I doubt you'd remember them without the book.  The SAS Survival Handbook is a great guide which would be helpful to everyone for future survival as well as being an interesting read.
B000667GFK|2.0|No manches....I cannot believe how many people actually like this CD...it was a huge disappointment to me.  This guy is going on 40, and he still has the same mousey, insignificant voice that is squeaked with inconsequential emotion.  If I compare him to the other daddy's boy, Alejandro Fernandez also got his start from dad's connections but AF has actually developed into a true artist in his own right.  In contrast, Luis Miguel's only virtue is the sex appeal of a green-eyed boy in a country of predominantly dark skinned women.    Further, el Vargas was also disappointing.  Their arrangements had a few good rhythmic changes & contra-melodies but overall they were done in annoyingly high keys and without the balance of a robust bass.  The Mariachi instrumental configuration has not gone through any lasting, meaningful changes in several decades...its about time that some of the sappy violins get replaced by a dark & dramatic cello, and the return of the heavy Tololoche bass which has been replaced by the lighter Guitarron.    Further, I would be ashamed to present this as an example of  Mexican music to people around the world.

B00005JMAH|1.0|Everything that could have gone wrong in this movie.... did. The awful director left out almost all quiditch, completely rearranged the plot, and made the movie really dark and ugly. Forget whatever any other review says, if you liked the plrevious two movies, YOU WILL HATE THIS ONE. DO NOT BUY IT. IT IS TRASH. I saw the movie in theater, and practicaly cried. There was also a new long, long trail to Hagrid's Hut, that I dont seem to remember being there before. No real Harry Potter fans would enjoy this movie. If you REALLY want to see this movie,rent it before you buy it, it IS possible you know.
B0001Z2RUK|4.0|British mope-rock is alive and well, as Brit-pop trio Keane makes their debut with \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" Strong, soaring vocals from Tom Chaplin are backed up by some solid piano-based pop and rock. Despite constant comparisons to Radiohead and Coldplay, Keane shows plenty of promise.<br /><br />It starts off with a strong piano solo in the quiet \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" followed by a stream of catchy pop like the thoughtful \\"Everybody's Changing\\" and the shimmery \\"Bend And Break,\\" and gossamer ballads like the melancholy \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" and soaring \\"She Has No Time.\\" It wraps up on a strong note with the plaintive \\"Bedshaped.\\"<br /><br />If any British band breaks the rock mold, it seems to be labelled as a Radiohead/Coldplay wannabe. On some superficial levels, Keane sounds rather like those bands. But it manages to remain a bit apart, rocking a bit harder and sounding a bit more straightforward and simple. It's hard to truly classify Keane as really being pop -- the lack of guitar and the prevailing piano seem to edge its catchy melodies closer to classical pop.<br /><br />The first thing to know about Keane is: No guitarist. Don't let it scare you -- the mix of rippling piano and gentle percussion are enough to make their melodies catchy without electric riffs. At the same time, they take some musical risks. Psychedelic piano-pop? Believe it or not, Keane does that.<br /><br />Tom Chaplin's vocals are the strongest point of Keane's lineup; his solid, high soars along with the shimmery music. At times his vocals get a bit TOO high, like when he sings the title line of \\"She Has No Time,\\" but most of the time he manages to sound like a heartbroken guy exorcising his breakup demons. The songs themselves aren't terribly complex or insightful, but they can be quite poignant: \\"And if you have a minute why don't we go/talk about it somewhere only we know?/This could be the end of everything/so why don't we go/somewhere only we know?\\"<br /><br />Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into greatness. But in \\"Hopes And Fears,\\" they have succeeded in the basics: bringing forth some beautiful, sometimes heartrending music.>  <br />Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into greatness.

6305280762|5.0|This movie hooked me. It's a long movie, running just over two and a half hours, but the story moves along at such a pace that it keeps you interested. THE TOWERING INFERNO was one of the best disaster films of the 70s. While the building looked pretty fake, the special effects were well done, and it was a good script overall. The acting was good too. When I watched it I kept thinking that this kind of terror could only happen in movies, but this isn't true, since we had the tragedy of September 11 2001. This is a movie worth seeing in my opinion.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|People who suggest parallels to 1930s Sci-Fi are FAR too easily convinced by \\"retro\\" trends.  Citing gauzed, halo-like imaging as some wondrous approach is like falling for the horribly widespread ploy that Thomas Kinkade is a great artist.  Tricks and gimmicks, that's Sky Captain.    <br /> <br />Only the visual effects have any bonafide relation to films of the 1930s, the worthwhile films anyway.  This film is infinitely distant from films like Metropolis.  This film is for dorks who excuse a film's flaws for the sake of the fact that it's particular to their interests.  If this film had portrayed a murder mystery, for example, these Sci-fi nerds wouldn't be nearly as impressed as they are about this film.   <br /> <br />Zero stars, a TURDKEY
B00005JKGO|5.0|This DVD of La Dolce Vita is excellent. The 3 hour film is visually overpowering with stark Roman cityscapes. The film is intelligent and complex. The story is that of a young tabloid writer, Marcello, who is pulled between 3 women in the course of the film. Marcello is in a relationship with possessive Emma. She is passive dependent, jealous, insecure and extremely beautiful. He is also the boy-toy for rich shallow Maddalena. Maddalenad is beautiful, extremely rich, but distractable, bored, and amoral. She is opposite of Emma in many ways. Then there is the beautiful Swedish actress Sylvie. Sylvie is the archtypal white goddess. She wears sunglasses during the day and she plays all night by the light of the moon. She is served by a satyr actor in a open air nightclub romp. She puts stray kittens in her hair, she howls with the dogs, she is beyond domination by any man. She ends her all night romp bathing in the Trevi fountains until dawn.  <br /> <br />Multiple characters and situations come and go, all revealing the struggle of Marcello to define himself. In many ways the film was like a dream, scenes linked together in a tentative way. The scenes are full of strangers in stunning Chanel dresses populating a world of decadence. <br /> <br />Marcello trys to establish honest communication with his playboy father, but is held at arms lenght by this sophisticated lady's man. Marcello idolizes the brilliant talented writer and composer Steiner.  Marcellow longs to be a serious writer and he is fascinated by the literary intelligencia that surround Steiner and his beautiful wife. But Steiner's inner demons cause him to kill his children and then commit suicide, depriving Marcello of a mentor and model for stability, respect, and the graceful successful artist.  <br /> <br />In the final scenes Marcello is totally decadent, partying with the alcoholic idle rich,  aging starletts and drag queens all night long. The sun rises on their party. As the party breaks up peasantmen drag a giant dead fish onto the shore. A young 16 year old nymphette waitress calls to Marcello. He says \\"I can not hear you\\".   He has finally lost his muse, he is beyond the power of women. <br /> <br />Maybe my interpretation is all wet. Who knows? The beauty of this grand dream from Fellini is that the interpretations are endless. It is a masterpiece.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Rarely has someone been so famous for so little, and that fact shines through in \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative.\\" While much-publicized pop star Britney Spears has produced four albums thus far, all that becomes clear in her \\"greatest hits\\" is that her music has never been that good, and it's only getting worse.<br /><br />This contains several of her hit singles, arranged in no particular order -- expect to bounce madly between slinky technopop and bouncy bubblegum with no logic in mind -- the obvious hits like \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" (future bondage-porn soundtrack?), \\"... Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" are set alongside much lesser pop hits like \\"Toxic,\\" the flaccid Madonna duet, and several others that were more or less forgotten.<br /><br />Like virtually any other greatest hits album, it has some bonus materials. There are from several remixes, none of which are too good -- for example, the Darkchild Remix of \\"Overprotected\\" is a clattery, feedback-laced affair. Spears also releases several previously unheard songs, such as the generic \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" and equally dull \\"Do Somethin'.\\" The most hyped song is \\"My Prerogative,\\" an electropop cover of a Bobby Brown song -- with lyrics like \\"I don't need permission/I make my own decisions,\\" it sounds like an immature, defiant finger-flip at the world. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Usually \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums are put out for one of two reasons. Either a band/singer has been around for eons and has enough glorious songs to fill an entire album, or the label they are/were signed to is trying to cash in. For the latter, think \\"Best of Mandy Moore,\\" which Ms. Moore had nothing to do with. Sadly, Spears' \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is neither -- instead, it feels like an effort to keep her at the forefront of music store displays.<br /><br />Her music is pretty standard for whatever kind of pop is attempted -- polished and overproduced. And, I might add, very predictable -- virtually every blip and note can be detected before it's heard. While \\"Toxic\\" has a halfway decent beat and some electric violins, Spears strikes out with her newer pop melodies, especially the ones that sound a lot like No Doubt covers.<br /><br />Her image also veers wildly through the various songs, starting off with the sound of a giggly teen who has done something naughty. Then she's launching into the more sexual stuff, especially in the horribly-written \\"Outrageous\\" (\\"Outrageous!/My sex drive/Outrageous!/My shopping sprees....\\"). But it doesn't feel genuinely sexy -- rather it feels like a little girl dressing up in mommy's lingerie.<br /><br />And Spears' vocals have never been too good -- her early material displays a voice that is pretty typical for a teenage girl. It has little range, and it's a sort of breathy, thin voice. That doesn't last -- her voice deteriorates over the more recent tracks from her fourth album, becoming drier and more computerized. The sound peaks in \\"My Prerogative,\\" where Spears sounds like a congested robot.<br /><br />Everyone has an opinion on Spears' much-publicized love life, but the quality of her pop music is pretty clear. While her early material was innocuous in a teen pop sort of way, her pop ditties have only deteriorated with time.every blip and note can be detected before it's heard.

B00004RFCM|5.0|SEX AND THE CITY is a show that took the world by storm. In Season One, the show really finds it's voice. The show gets better with time, not to say it was bad starting out (not at all) but you can see it go through transitions. Such as Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) talking into the screen about her thoughts and reflections, this is a bit awkward and later they would change this to her narrating the episodes with her reflections. Basically, you get to know the girls through these first 12 episodes. Carrie, the Sex and  the City columnist who is very analytical and thoughtful. Samantha (Kim Catrall), the sex crazed independant woman. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), the cynical lawyer. And Charlotte (Kristin Davis) the hopeful romantic. Also includes Willie Garson as Stanford, Carrie's best friend who is gay, and Chris Noth as Mr. Big.

055357342X|3.0|A schizophrenic review: I got part 3 as two separate books.<br /><br />Part 1: Blood & Gold<br />A deliberate theme (something fantasists don't always bother with, or at times even studiously avoid - most often they just tack on the standard rags to riches/goodies v. Baddies malarky) that Martin's forcing onto us: don't assume. Several characters that are, plotwise, `baddies' and have done some undeniably awful things, are still managing to arouse our sympathies. Best not to get to know your enemies too well, you might start to understand them, and that can only complicate things. Moreover Martin allows `goodies' to do things that may have felt noble but turn out to be stupid (the classic being Catelyn Stark). <br /> <br />Oh, there are still some just plain ugly and evil brutes about, and the odd paragon, but there are a lot in between. Not just, \\"I understand why they're so evil,\\" but I don't hate, for example, that incestuous mongrel who nearly killed a child for simply wandering in at the wrong time. The process is exemplified by Jon Snow, the [...]of the sincere and honourable Ned Stark. Snow holds his honour dearly, unable to claim any family advantage, and joins the black brotherhood, which has only its code of honour to hold it together. He takes his vows of celibacy and fealty seriously. And somehow ends up as a double agent, literally sleeping with the enemy to maintain his cover. What does he now think of oathbreakers? What does he now think of the `others' who, when you get to know them, are often better company than many of the brotherhood?<br /> <br />Danerys is probably still my favourite. She's forming a new dynasty from nothing, but there's some real magic and majesty there. When others say, `that's just the way the world is,\\" she's saying, \\"not once I'm finished with it.\\" And somehow despite circumstances she's making her ridiculous boasts not so ridiculous. Martin has given her a couple of great scenes in the birth of the dragons and the destruction of the slavers. She's also a confused teenager prone to rage, but this is queenly rage too. She's giving the hope of some overall justice and resolution.<br /><br />Part 2: Steel and Snow<br />I think that Martin may have strayed from Epic to Soap Opera. The series is moving too slowly, there are too many characters, and they are killed off or suddenly created with a major role in an almost random fashion. He could say that's part of the deal in times of war: someone will survive whole invasions and then be killed in a minor skirmish. It's in the style of a grand history, and he can be merciless with his characters. He's really challenging the `makers of your own destiny' idea: great and noble (and evil) schemes are just blown out. But I think he erred, for example, with Sandor Clegane's death: how could he have survived all he had with cunning and skill and reading the situation - and then suddenly so out of character misread the one that brought his death? Likewise Tyrion: shrewd and then a fool. And no-one seeming to question that if he was going to poison someone, he wouldn't have done it as ridiculously publicly.<br /> <br />But it's irritating. And I don't really want to be irritated. Please, please, some editing. Perhaps if it was done in another form: set up a world, and then take a different book each to focus on different characters, to tell a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. But he is going for the huge thing of all these concurrent storylines. As I write I'm thinking, \\"C'mon, stay with it, it's a really original approach, breaking totally away from the stifling predictability of probably 95% of the genre.\\"<br /> <br />But when there is no rhyme or reason to who lives and who dies, and Martin seems to be even stalling about getting to the larger threats surrounding the whole continent which will give us some sort of hopefully satisfying conclusion ... and when Martin himself seems to have no clear plan about the plot, but will happilymeander about with whoever's left and whoever appears, it is soap opera-ish. I hope it's not an utterly market driven thing - a very effective way to keep selling books - get them in on a story but, Jordan style, just keep endlessly publishing.<br /> <br />It would be OK if every `episode' was good enough to give pleasure alone, but they're not. Several of them are only `worth' inclusion for their relation to the `main' characters, but are still given far too many words. The dialogue is 99% about the melodramatic action: nobody's saying anything particularly wise or funny or clever. For something this big, he needs a team of writers to keep up the quality.<br /> <br />Much as I think he'd hate the comparison, I think he's done a bit of an Eddings and so far pulled four inconsistent books out of what could have been an excellent two or three. The danger of the genre: Orson Scott Card, Robert Jordan, Julian May and so on and so on. What's holding you is cheap tricks of \\"What will happen to Arya next week, fans?\\" - at some points I find myself saying, \\"I really don't care.\\" This was never the case with Tolkien - because Tolkien had finished the whole thing before he published. He had time to go back and revise appropriately.<br /> <br />Sure Martin's trying to do something different, but he's borrowed a lot from Tolkien, and I don't know that the altered form he's running with is working for him. So many `red herring' characters. Gendry? Maybe he'll turn up again, but there's too much going on.

B000001EAQ|5.0|I have heard people say that U2's peak extended from the Unforgettable Fire through the Joshua Tree to Achtung Baby (skipping over the grossly under-rated Rattle and Hum).  But I am of a mind to believe that U2 hit a second peak, a trilogy of albums, from Achtung Baby through Zooropa to close with Pop. <br />Pop is the dirty uncle of the trilogy - the kind of relative the family would like to lock up and shut into a back room.  Pop is the most difficult of all of U2's albumns - it is an album that sounds and feels like shattered glass, and its lyrical themes are unpleasant, revealing, and made of the kind of stuff we either want to flush down the toilet or paste on our locker doors as a kind of grotesque centerfold. <br />When U2 crafted Achtung Baby they entered onto a project and a journey that would take them into places that they would not have otherwise dreamed of.  Leaving the Joshua Tree behind they submerged themselves in the dirt and mud and grit of humanity.  The albumn Pop is the very bottom of that immersion in humanity. <br />It is broken and cold and sick.  It is also hot and crazy and distrastously tinged with something that only seems like hope.  The songs on this album stretch from the sublime to the grotesque and back again through the slimey or the desperate. On this albumn, Pop, the members of the band did something in sound and vision that was infinitely ahead of their time.  But the sad news is that the times show no signs of trying to catch up. The whole Zoo-olgy is Christlike in the sense that U2 is willingly to drink from that ultimate cup the poor man from Nazareth drank from.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I agree with everyone about how good this concert was...but who was the female (blues) singer who sang \\"Horse to the Water\\"? It's not included on the CD, and no one mentions the song or her. For me, this was the most electrifying performance of many the whole evening. Her one song is more than worth the price of the entire DVD. Does anyone know who she is? (She must be well known, or she wouldn't have been on the stage.)
B0006399FS|4.0|I find myself listening to this CD over and over. I like the music, but it is odd that I keep trying to sing one song and lapsing into another U2 song that seems similar. Bono's lyrics and delivery are similar, the Edges guitar work is similar, to stuff we've heard before. But U2 isn't about catchy singles and disposable pop. <br /> <br />This is a CD that you are supposed to listen to. It is driven more by lyrics than by music. The music supports and contains and caresses the lyrics. Since Bono's lyrics are often opaque and ambiguous, this has proven altogether too frustrating for many listeners. I love it.  <br /> <br />As someone a few years younger than Bono, I appreciate the more mature angle of his music. In \\"A Man and a Woman\\" he expresses the deep love one \\"settles into\\" in a serious relationship, where \\"I would never take the chance/of losing love to find romance.\\" <br /> <br />Though some wish Bono expressed his politics and religion as he did when he was in his 20s (why is it that fans expect their favorite musicians to stay the same forever?), Bono's politics are still here, his faith is still here, but it's more modulated. In \\"Miracle Drug\\" we have a song related in theme to The Flaming Lips' \\"Race for the Prize\\" -- both songs focus on the redemptive, even spiritual aspect of new drug development. Bono expresses the way God works his miracles through our hands.when he sings \\"Of science and the human heart there is no limit.\\" We have a world where often, matters of the heart are seen as antithetical to matters of science, but Bono sees the divine spark underlying both. This is deeply spiritual. And political, when you think of his work on behalf of third world countries, where the miracle drugs are already here, but not delivered to those who need them. Also, in \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" he sings on behalf of the developing world --\\"Would you deny for others/What you demand for yourself?\\" and \\"Where you live should not decide/Whether you live or whether you die.\\" <br /> <br />And in \\"Origin of the Species\\" and in \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" he deals with birth and death in a beautiful way.  <br /> <br />Again, I understand those that listen to the CD once and go away cold. There's no real anthem songs that you'll remember forever on one listen. This is not Gwen Stefani's saccharine CD designed to be swallowed and forgotten in a year. HTDAAB is an album that you'll end up cherishing, I think, if you let it grow on you and let yourself settle into and dwell upon.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Like many of you I approached \\"Gilmore Girls\\" with caution at first.  It's a family-oriented WB borderline-soap with a decidedly girly reputation.  That has not however stopped me from becoming addicted to one of the most falling-down funny, literate and psychologically complex shows on.  It's appointment TV for me along with \\"The Sopranos\\", the late, lamented \\"Oz\\" and \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\\"  Lauren Graham is a tough-minded, brilliantly comic marvel as Lorelai Gilmore, the renegade scion of a blue-blood Connecticut family who got pregnant at 16 and by sheer force of will created a great life for her daughter.  That daughter, also named Lorelai by her mother \\"in a frenzy of pain medication,\\" is nicknamed Rory and is played by the angelic Alexis Bledel.  Rory in public high school has aspirations to Harvard, so Lorelai approaches her starchy, proud parents after years of estrangement. (They are played with marvelous humanity by old-pros Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop.)  They gingerly begin to rebuild their relationship in order to realize Rory's possibly spectacular future.<br /><br />They say that executive producer Amy Sherman-Palladino sounds exactly like the verbally agile Lorelai when she speaks.  She has created an enchanted village for the Gilmores to live in called Stars Hollow.  This is where the genius of the show kicks in.  Instead of being sticky-sweet like a hundred other small town dwellers you've seen on TV, these people are benign but uncontrollably insane eccentrics who have created a little Utopia for individualists. (Just how does Kirk hold every job in town?)  The point of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" is that rigid social conventionality does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with \\"family values.\\"  You can be a super-mon like Lorelai and still be a non-conformist.  Lorelai is currently looking for the \\"whole stupid Dan Quayle, two dogs and a cat, matching running suits package\\" in a family, but she's not putting off living her life and raising her daughter in the meantime.  (She will probably eventually get the whole package with the gruff but good-hearted Luke, the backwards-baseball cap-wearing diner owner who everyday feeds the cooking-challenged girls.)<br /><br />In the second season, we meet Jess, Luke's troubled nephew from the big city who has been sent to Stars Hollow to clean up his act.  Like a lot of fans, I am not that thrilled by the James-Dean-aping Jess, but he provokes an interesting reaction in Rory.  Normally she is the sweetest and most level-headed of girls but when she lays eyes on Jess she reveals an unsuspected streak of attraction towards the irresponsible little punk.  (Who resembles in character more than a little Rory's long-absent father.)  It appears that Rory has her own rebellion issues to work out; like mother, like daughter in more ways than one.  This is what I mean when I say this show is one of the most psychologically acute shows on TV.  Lorelai is Wonder Woman but also shows a inability to commit to a relationship with a man.  Rory is a preternaturally \\"good girl\\" with a  hidden but similar independent side that both delights and alarms her mother.  Richard and Emily, the grandparents, are hopelessly blinded by their own social class issues, but they desperately love their granddaughter (and reluctantly, her mother.)  It's a family that's as realistically screwed up as yours is.  If you get the \\"Gilmore Girls' DVD's you will have many, many hours of great viewing pleasure you can look forward to.r daughter in the meantime.

B000002QWD|5.0|This is the only Christmas album that would make my \\"Top 10 Albums of All-Time\\" list.  I am currently 24 years old and I found this record in my parents stack of vinyl years ago.  There is something amazing about this album that is hard to put into words.  I've recently bought it on cd.  Strangely, the cd is called \\"White Christmas\\" while the original album is titled \\"Merry Christmas.\\"  Exact same cover and content.  I play the vinyl a few times a week during the Christmas holiday.  I prefer how it sounds to the cd.  The cd is one of those $5 bargain bin releases.  It doesn't sound very good.  Hopefully one day it will be given the remastered treatment it deserves.   <br /> <br />I often tear up when I listen to this album.  Yet I keep going back to it.  It sounds very old and the mood it puts you in is quite unexplainable.  It transports you back in time.  When there was snow at Christmas.  When actors sang.  When the world was much different, more wholesome about Christmas, family, and the holidays.  I've recently lost two grandparents in the last two years.  This album makes me fantasize about how my dad's Christmas's might have been.  With all our family together, in the house that is now abandoned, in the old decaying polish neighborhood in the suburbs of Buffalo, NY I used to go to for holidays when I was younger.  It just reminds me of my grandparents and all those wonderful Christmas celebrations that don't seem to be as big a part of the world anymore.   <br /> <br />The first half of this album are the slower, more introspective, Christmas songs.  I was going to list my favorites but I love them all.  The background vocals on some of these are so errie and haunting.  Sung by people long passed.  \\"Faith of Our Fathers,\\" \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\\" \\"Adeste Fideles.\\"  The music by the John Scott Trotter Orchestra makes you feel things you just can't find in other Christmas music.  The second half of the album have more upbeat numbers: \\"Jingle Bells,\\" \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\\" and \\"It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas\\" to name a few.  Songs ilke \\"Christmas in Killarney\\" paints a wonderful picture of Christmas's of the time.  Friends, family, Fr. John blessing the house, department store shopping, love. <br /> <br />This album is just fantastic.  You are transported back to a time when it seemed Christmas still had more of it's religious background and was not as commercial as it is now.  It is prefectly of it's time.  It's dated and thats when it works best.  You are put back into those old pictures of your early Christmas's or Christmas's celebrated by your family before you were around.  Back to those times when my grandparents were still alive.  When the world was much more innocent.  All of this swirls through my mind everytime I play this album and I love revisiting it, and staying there, time and time again.
B00003CX95|4.0|Let us stipulate that this movie is romance on the book, \\"Braveheart\\" (by Randall Wallace), which is itself a romance on the very real Scotts hero, William Wallace.  In those two steps of fictionalization, loosely based on history, more than a few facts can float off into the ether.  You can easily search the web and find any number of websites that will list all the errors in the movie.  There was even a show in the History Channel discussing the reality of Wallace's life versus the movie and why certain choices were made, such as fighting the battle of Stirling Bridge on a field in the movie rather than on a bridge as it was in real life.  Never mind the fact of the real life ages of the characters making most of the interactions in the movie absolutely impossible.<br /><br />And while all comparisons of fact and fiction are interesting, two facts remain:  the movie made the name of William Wallace more popularly known than he had been in centuries, and it is a very effective and exciting movie.  Believe me, I understand the pain of those who truly love Wallace and feel that their hero has been disgraced and cheated.  It is almost always true that facts suffer greatly when compressed into the constraints of a movie and those that know the facts understand how they add to the meaning and purpose of their hero.  They resent any compromise or cheapening for simple expediency or catering to popular appetites.  This is all fair and true.  However, this movie is a fiction of a fiction of based on real figures.  In a way, it is the opposite of the old \\"Dragnet\\" show.  The events are fiction; only the names have been kept.<br /><br />Leaving history aside, the film is exciting, stirs feelings of patriotism, and allows good to triumph over evil even at death.  In the movie, Wallace has to overcome everything, including the loss of family and betrayal by those who should have been his friends.  He has real fears of what he has to face at the end and it is his faith that provides the foundation of his courage.  That kind of nobility inspires us and stirs our own resolve.<br /><br />The battle scenes, while historically inaccurate to a great degree, are amazing to behold.  There is a lot of gore and violence in these medieval battles.  It is that gore and a couple of gratuitous uses of the medieval f-word that give the movie an R rating more than the brief scene at the grove with Wallace and his new wife.<br /><br />While not one of my all time favorite films, it is very much worth viewing and contemplating.tion of his courage.

B000669GAI|5.0|This greatest hits disc is a must have. Great for the casual listener to bring him in the cult that is pearl jam.It is a showchase of great songs that easly says who's your daddy creed nickleback and the so many wannabes of rock that there are today.No pearl jam will never get the credit it deserves they should be known as a band that stood for something and didn't back down now thats rock.As for the rabid fans of the band which i am one we shouldn't be to mad beacause our favs didn't get on cause I know we already have about 1000 versions of every song live anyway so i say to yall take it for what it is another way to spead the jam.
B00008DDSC|4.0|It's a shame that in these times where everyone is getting in touch with their feelings, there are so little movies adressing the diffrent lifestyles out there. I loved how this movie showed two people attempting to break out of societies concept of SM/DS to live their lives as they both WILLINGLY want to. She is a natural submissive/masochist. She couldnt change it when she tried. He is a natural Dominant/Sadist. This is the formula for a happy relationship. Find your compliment. <br />I applaud them both for walking off the beaten path (no pun intended), and trying a new concept as far as playing these roles. But you gotta hand it to James Spader for always upping his game and keeping us suprised. Plus he's just SUPER SEXY!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I don't usually write online reviews, but Wicked blew me away so much that I feel the need to scream it off roof tops. I am not usually a Broadway person, due to my short attention span, but Wicked and specifically Elphaba's character kept me captured from start to end.  <br />Tears rose in my eyes during Defying Gravity because Menzel's voice is so powerful and the song is absolutely fantastic. Beside that song, I recommend any song Menzel sings in because she is just amazing.  <br />This is not to diminish the rest of the CD which is also great.  Worth every  penny for the CD and the show, which i am now seeing a second time (although rush to it before January 9th when Menzel leaves).
B00063F8B2|2.0|Other than being somewhat surprised that Tom Hanks can sing as well as he can, there is very little in this soundtrack that I find interesting.  The old material is, well...old.  The newer material is lacking in anything particularly compelling.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This factual and dramatic film is one of the many rebuttals to salacious charges made over the last 40 years that the Papacy did nothing to help the Jews against Nazi tyranny in World War II.   Nothing could be more from the truth !   His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, was relentless in his determination to thwart the Hitler-Mussolini terrorization and murder of millions of Jews, Catholics and other Cristian groups.   The vicious attacks by ignorant anti Catholic writers and critics have gone on for years but papers, reports and eye witness accounts over the same period, most notably the last several years, have totally demolished the false and bigoted charges made against Pius XII.   The Catholic Church, notably the newly elected Pope, Pius XII in 1938, did more to hide and disguise Jews and move them into convents, churches and ultimately out of Gemany and Italy to safety in allied countries than any other single organization.  These heroic deeds were recognized by the Head Rabbi Zolli of Rome so much so that he became a convert to Catholicism, taking the Christian name of Eugene after Eugenio Pacelli, the full name of Pius XII.   Years later, none other than Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir also praised the valiant efforts of Pius XII in her official thanks for saving thousands of Jewish lives. <br /> <br />  This film, THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, focuses on one of many heroes of the Holocaust, Monsignor Flaherty, brilliantly protrayed by Gregory Peck with a supporting cast of eminent actors and actresses including Christopher Plummer, John Gielgud and Raf Valone.    <br /> <br />Although the Pope, as portrayed by Gielgud, insists on the fact of neutrality to the Nazi regime and at times appears passive, in actuality, the real Pope Pius XII, was a master of his own war of words with Hitler, so much so that the Vatican was never harmed due to the world wide indignation over jsut the thought of a military reprisal by Hitler.   This movie should be a mandaatory part of anyhistory class dealing with WWII.  It is simply excellent ! <br /> <br />Dick Bobnick, Burnsville, Minnesota

B00003BDXG|4.0|When Oliver Stone gets down to work he can produce some amazing things, it shows with Natural Born Killers. This film has gained quite a reputation for being an influentially violent films, it apparently makes crime and murder look innocent and was therefore said to be responsible for a rise in crime - this even resulted in it being banned in the UK, until recent years where it has been developed into a director's cut and a cut version (although I think potential criminals would buy the ultraviolent copy.  <br /> Yet this copy actually does not glorify violence in any way, it merely tries to convey the media's obsession with it. Mickey and Mallory Knox are presented as two <br />hard-assed, lovey-dovey, stonecold serial killers. With acting talents such as Woody Harrellson and Juliette Lewis, with a brief appearence from Tommy Lee Jones, this film was destined for cult status and deserves it, from the pen of acclaimed director/writer Quentin Tarantino it is no wonder this film is so good and no wonder I love it so much - The only let down is that terrible reputation.
B00003CXV4|5.0|Sweet November has been the best romantic movie I have seen yet. Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves play the perfect roles and can make your heart melt. This movie is worth it. I have watched this movie so many times and it still leaves me crying. If you love romantic movies this movie is perfect for you. The chemistry in this movie is amazing. Watch this movie believe me you'll love it.
B00030590I|3.0|The movie is not absolutely fantastic but its deffinately an entertaining watch. The movie is fit with a great range of colours and superb arty style movements in the combat of the greatest fighters in the world. <br /> <br />The special effects in the movie are quite stunning, in the fighting scenes no moves look dodgy even when they take on an army the moves that are performed accually look like they could do the job if perfected in the way that they are in the movie although the one on ones are much more amaising. Slow motion effects are added to see the sharpness of the skills performed by the warriors. The artistic style of fighting in this movie is deffinately a pick up from all the previous movies that i've seen that take on the same style. <br /> <br />The movie is very musical, the movie is very dreamy like a fantasy. <br /> <br />(Jet li) plays the deadliest warrior in japan and is hired to take out 3 of the other equally as deadly warriors and succeeds, presented to the kings throne he is left alone with the king himself. Throughout the story the king tries to reveal him for who he really is, tries to suss him out, because he believes it is impossible to defeat the three warriors. Jet li tells three stories of how he deafeated the warriors, one being all lie, the second being a presumed story and the third being the truth, during each of his stories the main dress colours and background are a certain colour in each story to get you to pick up on what is going on a little easier. <br /> <br />Although i am not a big fan of this type of movie, i thought it was pretty good and i think that you should give it a try.
0425156842|4.0|Mystery part which is not unlike \\"MATRIX for children\\" fails, but still a good philosophy textbook.  <br />Pros: Explaining philosophers for children without losing its crux of logic is not an easy job. The author was successful in this respect. <br />Cons: 1) the mystery part was centered on the question \\"how to revolt against the God\\". The author requires readers to invest vast time into this through the book, but simply abandoned to answer the question at last. No twist at the end. 2) To make it \\"easier\\", the authors avoid using any basic philosophical terms such as metaphysics, epistemology,  a priori synthetic proposition, zeitgeist, whollism etc. This is like explaining baseball with using pitcher, innings, and homerun. 3) Too long. Good editor can condense this book to 200 pages without losing its crux. Especially the first 300 pages are way too slow. Skip it and read from Descartes. Mystery portion reaches its climax at the Berkeley chapter, and nothing really happens after that. 4) The author's perspective is clouded by his personal Christian faith. While he included Jesus Christ as a philosopher, he didn't include anti-Christians such as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Russell. In that sense, he doesn't take a neutral stance. 5) There is no explanation regarding how the old philosophy are regarded by current major philosophers. For example, Descartes' dualism, Berkeley's idealism, Kant and Hegel's metaphysics are not supported by current philosophers, but readers who are new to philosophy would not notice this from this book. Science-technology revolution of 20th century was a product of philosophy of science, materialism, and empiricism originated from Locke/Hume, but the authors's Christian faith prevents him to give us a clear perspective. 6) No 20th century philosophy except Sartre. Not including structuralism philosopher like Derrida/Foucault is understanble, but omitting Wittgenstein is critical.  <br />   <br />

B0002IQLY4|5.0|\\"Bedtime Stories\\" was a late night cable TV series. This DVD contains three episodes: \\"Blind Fold\\", \\"First Love\\", and \\"The Rival\\". The stories all center around a brothel run by Kim Dawson. Women come to her to get help for problems with their sex life. It's almost identical to the types of stories contained in Mainline's \\"Secrets of the Kama Sutra\\" releases and is produced by the same people responsible for those stories. And like \\"Secrets\\", the stories aren't really that interesting, but deliver plenty of well done sex scenes.<br /><br />There are a total of eleven sex scenes. Five are boy/girl. Two are boy/girl, with another girl watching and providing her own entertainment. One is boy/girl/girl. One is girl solo. Two are girl/girl. The women are beautiful and include several softcore A listers: Kim Dawson, Gabriella Hall, Flower, Taimie Hannum, and Samantha Phillips.<br /><br />\\"Diary of Seduction\\" is a typical low budget softcore feature film with a standard \\"thriller\\" plot. Call girl. Murder. Female private investigator who goes undercover. Nothing new here. It's a decent softcore flick, but nothing special. Perfectly suited to be the B side on a double feature release.<br /><br />It contains nine sex scenes. Six are boy/girl. One is boy/girl with second girl watching. One is boy/girl/girl. One is girl/girl. The sex scenes are okay, but not great. They are just a little on the tame side, with the camera only occasionally panning down to the nether regions during the action. The women are all attractive. Some of them are also adult film stars. I was familiar with Nicole Sheridan, Amy Lindsay, and Kaylynn from other videos. The other two women, Wendy Rice and Tina Tyler, were new to me.<br /><br />This DVD is worth getting for \\"Bedtime Stories\\" alone. \\"Diary of Seduction\\" has some good stuff too, and makes it a better value. This one is very recommended.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Ghost in The Shell on the whole is one of those \\"not for everyone\\" kind of deals. The philosophical thoughts are deep... really deep. You must think, and think hard to come to some understanding of what is going on. This is a film for people who like to read and think, and for people who want to be visually blow away. <br /> <br />anyone who claims the characters are \\"flat\\" doesn't know what it means to emotionally read between the lines. <br /> <br />and if you don't know how to read between the lines, you are going to miss the true majesty of this film... because anyone can recognize, and be awed by the visuals... <br /> <br />there are a lot of hollywood films that are all special effects and not much else... if you look closely, the special effects in this film aren't nearly as impressive as the content. <br /> <br />If you like this, You will like and should definately check out the original Ghost in the Shell film, and the Stand Alone Complex (1&2). You will not be dissapointed.
B0002Y69NG|2.0|The first Matrix movie was awesome, and this DVD box set is very impressive, but the sequels?  THE MATRIX RELOADED fell short of many fans' expectations. Starting off roughly six months after the original, Reloaded is the continuing fight against the machines and the war to save Zion. But while THE MATRIX had a clever plot, amazing SFX and added 'sleeper hit' surprise, it seems that the Wachowskis have given us half a movie with decent action but the meandering, non-sensical plot (As everyone knows) is the film's downfall. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprise the roles as Neo and Trinity, but the new supporting characters, while interesting, are over-shadowed by the central ensemble or renegade freedom-fighters. The much-hyped CGI ranges from impressive to just plain hokey. However despite it's flaws, the film's plus point is it's impressive action sequences, notably the 'Burly Brawl'. One could point out that the threat of Agent Smith has somewhat diminished since Smith can endlessly replicate himself and Neo can simply fly away. But hey, what is real? After several extended action sequences and an ending that befuddles more than amazes, you leave the cinema hoping that THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS will somehow explain everything.<br /><br />Just like so many third acts in film trilogies, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS loses the plot. Squandering a great opportunity for a satisfying conclusion while simultaneously destroying the original idea by nullifying the importance of the first. That's quite an accomplishment. Suffering from a lousy script, acting that threatens to redefine the term 'wooden' and so many frustrating Freudian overtones that it boggles the mind, one seriously now wonders if this whole idea was actually conceived as a three-part actioner rather than commercially-based money grabbing sequels tacked on to the first. RELOADED was a lame attempt at pretending it was a film on its own. We all knew it was merely two-hour exposition paving the way for REVOLUTIONS with a couple of half-decent action scenes thrown in. And it stank worse than Batman And Robin.<br /><br />You also get the pretentious MATRIX, RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS Revisited discs, the shaky Animatrix and The Zion Archive. Hrrm. Very suspicious this is, veeeerrrryyyy suspicious. This DVD collection asks the question: Are the Wachowskis just trying some more money-grabbing tactics? Who one earth needs 10 discs? You do not need 10 discs for the special features. The first film is cool, but every person on the planet who has a DVD player has bought it already.ONS with a couple of half-decent action scenes thrown in.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|\\"Mary Poppins\\" is one of that select group of films that can truly be called 'Classic', a project conceived in love and filled with so much child-like wonder that it will never grow old or 'out-of-date'. Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's remarkable career, the \\"Mary Poppins\\" 40th Anniversary Special Edition is simply magnificent!<br /><br />Based on P.L. Travers' tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors' works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney's desire to make a definitive, truly 'special' film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed 'pet' project, \\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings.<br /><br />With Travers' grudging approval, casting began.

B000001Y16|5.0|Tupac's last recording (before his death) was his rawest. The emotional impact is intense on almost every song. Listening to this album you will know what exactly what was going on in Tupac's life at that time. This album was released only 2 months after his death. One of the greatest albums I ever heard
B0001AP12G|5.0|Beware, this album is like smack. Once you listen to it, nothing else ever seems as worthwhile or satisfying by comparison. College Dropout rarely leaves my cd player and after a long day at work i break out in a sweat if i don't get home quickly to spend some quality time wit Kanye. Highlights of the album are difficult to pinpoint cos it is all so inspiringly, heart wrenchingly good and trying to pick a favourite would be like chosing between your children. The self proclaimed 'Rudolph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc' Kanye proves on this album he has what it takes to fill Jiggas enormous shoes. His production skills far surpass those of his superior and while Kanye's rhymes fall just short of Jays, his lilting rapping style is very listenable, so much so that you don't even mind all the god talk. Man, when i first heard 'Jesus Walks' i was almost converted. Kanye West is the future of hip hop. Jump on the bandwagon now and buy this record.
B00009V7T2|5.0|De-Loused might not be an attractive listen with the first spin, you'll be thinking ..\\"What the hell is this??\\".  Then the second time around try to place yourself in the context of the concept....you'll be blown away!  What an amazing album!  Most of the album to me sounds like Rush at 500 MPH, especially the lead singer.  Experimental/Progressive rock at its pure best, every minute it seems there is a new time signature or beat, but it all molds together quite wonderously!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm always amazed at how easily the networks will dismiss a quality program.  Any glimmer of wit or creativity and the axe falls.  Thanks to those responsible for making this series availble to us on DVD.  I found it to be fresh, funny, and cutting edge.  Looking forward to the upcoming feature film...
1582403589|5.0|I just read 1-6 and it is great.  This is survival fiction at its best.  This story beats any zombie movie, since it goes on past two hours.  The series is currently at #14 and seems to be still coming.<br /><br />The interesting part about this series is the the Walking Dead does not refer to the zombies...
0060207051|5.0|This is THE book to read to children from day 1.  The lines never tire, the pictures never fade, the contentment and draw of this book never diminish.<br /><br />This book is THE read it again-and-again-and-again-and-again favorite of all time.  I do encounter children who have not heard its gentle lines which makes me very sad.  Every child should hear this book when they are  young.  Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd made magic with this book and it stays with you for a lifetime.
B00006EXDM|5.0|The Stones have produced so many great songs over the years (although  not much in the past 20) and as we all know have had many different greatest hits collections. However, this one stands out in my mind as the greatest. <br /> <br />The greatest thing about this CD is that every song is listenable.  With some of the other greatest hits cd's there are songs that some people are glad were put on but others not. With this, anyone can enjoy any song without saying \\"why'd they put this on here\\". My only real criticism of this album is why no \\"Last Time\\". This was probably one of their top five biggest songs at this time, yet its not on here. I've wondered this since I got it and, although I'm not even a big fan of this song, it has never made much sense to me. <br /> <br />Anyway, for the casual fan who's never really listened to or heard much of the Stones music, the standout tracks for me (or for the best introduction)would be Sympathy For The Devil,(I Cant Get No)Satisfaction,Street Fighting Man,Gimme Shelter,and Midnight Rambler. After these the best ones are (in my opinion)Jumpin Jack Flash,Brown Sugar,Paint It Black,Under My Thumb,and Honky Tonk Woman. So if you asked me, I'd say this is essential to any music collection. A great way to get the most of the biggest hits.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is surprising.  First listen, I wasn't too impressed but after giving it several more listens, the songs began to emerge.  I think this is a stronger album than ATYCLB.  My favorites are \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", and \\"All Because of You\\" but every listen, shows me more that I like.  Edge's guitar work here reminds me of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", soaring and ethereal.
0446677450|4.0|This book proved to be very educational and resourceful. I was at first skeptical of this book and assumed it would give useless tips that only applied to the author. However, I found Kiyosaki's advice in the novel very useful and was able to use his advice to broaden my business knowledge. I was pleasantly suprised by the originality of the book and found it to be a suprisingly enjoyable read. I definently recommend this book to everyone, because everyone can gain something from reading this book. The information present in this novel can prove to be very resourceful and can teach parents and children alike sound money management. Also I found Kiyosaki's personal anecdotes to be inspirational and interesting. Although he came from a financially comfortable family, he was still able to solely create his own wealth. Kiyosaki's business vision was interesting to see and people should come away from the novel with new information. After reading this book I would say my business skills have improved because I am now aware of different financial aspects . This book definently proved to be resourceful and I think this book should be a definite read.
0140177396|1.0|I happen to be a high school student and this book just happened to be required for my class. (please do not read this if you hate spoilers not that I encourage anyone to read this book anyway) To start off, this must be the most depressing most unbelieveably horrid books I have ever read in my entire life rivaling only Hemmingway in that matter. The entire book tells the story of two friends Lennie and George who have a dream to own a farm and basically to live the American dream and to live without cares. Well as the story goes on, lennie runs into the wife of the son of the owner of the farm (who is already hitting on everone else in the farm including Lennie now More on that later). Anyhow, they get a bunch of the hands on the farm together and are getting ready to own their farm and throughout the entire book you will just want them to get that farm but it doesn't happen. Lennie kills the lady and is forced to run and hide where George told him to go if ever he were in trouble and what doess George do? HE SHOOTS LENNIE! George goes on to become a drunk and the novella has a most depressing ending. Basically, this was an incredibly depressing book (like all Steinbacks) and is the last book I will ever want to read again. My teacher calls it realism I call it flat out pessimism. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who knew how to take a lousy story and write it well enough to sell like so many \\"great\\" american novelists of the 20th century. This was the first book I ever felt like ripping to shreds and unless you yourself are depressed or wish to become so, DO NOT READ A STEINBACK NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU!
068987474X|1.0|Girls, I'm very saddened by your responses to this book. While it does have some points to make for the truly desperate and insecure women out there, (judging by the sales) I'm shocked to find how many of you are actually out there. It's so typical, as if some shmuky guy could speak on the behalf of so many decent, kind-hearted women I'm happy you're married Greg. I'm happy you treat your wife well. But many of us have been treated well and continue to be treated well because we have brains, dignity, and enough intelligence to know that your opinion matters very little in the big scheme of things. Our boundaries are what matter to us and how we see ourselves. Look, if I'm going to call some random dude I met and then sleep with him, I don't care if he's not that into me...cause I'm not that into him. In fact, there's more. And don't be shocked. I am a woman who's commitment-phobic...Yes, there is such a thing and would shock him to realize. And yes, I've lived with wonderful, imperfect man and didn't want to get married. And yes, you say all the couples in your book are happy, but divorce rates say that 50 percent of them are probably not. And the questions in your book were not real people. Just anecdotes you wrote yourself so you can then take them down and feel like a real man. Honestly, I don't think Greg even likes women, not even his wife, and the female author clearly hates herself. Why else would he go around talking about how wonderfully he treat his wife? He never said one thing nice about her (what she did for a living, why he loved her) only how he treats her. I'm sure she's pleased with that as punch Greg, but I'm not. Your book talks down to women. Of course they do have it coming since many actually bought your book, but I don't appreciate it at all. And all my happily commited friends who are in long term, non-married relationships see a fraud when we hear it. Good luck! And congratulations for finding just the right hook to keep women feeling insecure, clueless, and in need of your book. I'm sure the follow up will do even better! You've made the world a better place...Trust her when she says that :)
0316666343|5.0|In the over 2,000 books I have read, I would have to say without a doubt this is the best one.  It moved me and took me on a ride with Susie.  Alice Sebold is an up and coming writer for a reason, I have no doubt she will surpass some of the best authors of our time.  She writes almost passively, but in a way that you feel as if you are discovering something with the characters in her book, the way you might look at a best friend and together the two of you are thinking the same thing at the same time, a realization you both don't have to speak, this is what Alice Sebold creates with Susie Salmon, like the fish.  And I won't ever forget this book.  I will be surprised and awe-stricken if I can ever find another book that can hold a candle to this one.  I don't know where this book came from or how Sebold's first fiction book was able to do what established authors have been trying to do for years, but I pray she keeps on doing it.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Edward Bloom's life reads like a fairytale. Throughout his life, he meets giants, werewolves, an idyllic town by the name of Spectre, a witch, a pair of conjoined twins in China, and more importantly, the woman that he would later spend the rest of his life with.  <br /> <br />So unusual is his life, that his only son thinks that his father is weaving a cocoon around himself by eluding reality. Instead of accepting those stories as facts, the son gradually distances himself from his father, both unable to see eye to eye.  <br /> <br />There is no separating myth from the man when it comes to Edward Bloom. We are not told which part of the story is not true, but we are led to believe that some of Edward's stories are exaggerated, for he is a great storyteller. Ewan McGregor puts in a superb performance as the young Edward Bloom, carefree, adventurous, and headstrong. One of the best scenes in this movie would be the scene where he met his future wife in the circus, and time came to a standstill. Billy Crudup was effective in his portrayal of the practical son, who refuses to believe his father's stories. Jessica Lange's small but crucial role helps us to believe the love Edward and his wife had for each other.  <br /> <br />Considering that the movie relied on the element of surprise as its stronghold, I was disappointed with its predictability. The ending did not promise to be the \\"big surprise\\". Yet, I was touched all the same.  <br /> <br />A wonderful movie about a man who lived on through his tales, never ever getting caught even by death, making him the biggest fish of all.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|..this movie was pretty good.  I am not a huge Will Ferrell fan, sure he was great on SNL with some of his characters, but overall I got sick of seeing him in every sketch on SNL.  A friend let me borrow his copy to view and I must admit, that I found myself laughing and being amused by this film.  I do enjoy Bob Newhart so his presence in the film made the humor for me more enjoyable.  The work by James Caan is great, although I would have enjoyed more character development between Walter and Emily (\\"Buddy's\\" father and step-mother in the film).  Nonetheless, the film was a nice mix of the Holiday-TV specials (arctic puppets, Leon the Snowman, etc.) I grew up with and some grown-up humor. <br /> <br />One thing that I did enjoy immensely were the arctic puppets, there is a special behind-the-scenes part on how they were created \\"Lights, Camera, Puffin!\\" by the Chiodo Brothers with the stop-motion work--that was entertaining and made me love the arctic puppets (the puffin, polar bear, walrus, etc.) even more.
B00005A46T|5.0|This cd isnt as good as selftitled but it still kicks major a** <br />its a little heavier the best songs are Heretic Anthem, My plague, and End of everything STAY (SIC) MAGGOTS
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Every holiday season, movies and tv bombard us with either treasured holiday classics in film and TV, or they try to re-create that magic with a new movie or TV special. More often than not, the new ones, in this day and age, don't measure up. I am happy to say that this movie, while it doesn't exactly succeed, comes closer than anything in recent memory. Directed by actor Jon Favreau(\\"Swingers\\"), \\"Elf\\" is a slight and silly piece of cutesy fluff that should entertain everyone, from most any age group, to the very end. Former SNL cast member Will Ferrel, who can do no wrong in my humble opinion, plays Buddy The Elf, but he is no ordinary elf. Many years ago, while Santa(played by Ed Asner), visited an orphange, a little baby crawled into Santa's sack, without the big guy knowing, and ended up in the North Pole. Instead of taking him back, they named him Buddy(after his diapers), and Papa Elf(Played by the always wonderful Bob Newhart), decided to adopt the infant and raise him as his own. And as an elf. Flash forward 30 years, and the gigantic, human sized Buddy finds out he is human and sets out to find his real father, who he learns is a publisher named William Hobbs, and lives in a far away land known as \\"New York City\\". Buddy meets up with Hobbs(James Caan)and his family, while adjusting to big city life. In the process, he meets the lovely Jove(Played by the adorable Zooey Deschanell), and tries to find his place in the world and to open the eyes of his father. It's pretty standard in the plot area, but it is decently written and structured, and Buddy is such a charming and loveable oaf, that you watch every second he's on screen. The movie, surprisingly, isn't as wackily funny as one would expect from Ferrell and the nature of the material. It's funny, but has a sense of romance and nostalgia that kinda makes it seem like those oh-so-warmy made for lifetime Christmas movies. But better. The supporting cast also includes Mary Steenburgen as Caan's wife, and anuncredited Michael Lerner. The movie is cute and digestable, and it has that oh so important holiday message of opening your eyes and seeing what you got and embrace it. We've seen it a million times, but it never fails to resonate or matter if it's done well. And it's done pretty well here. Ferrell is a commanding presence, that's for sure, and he makes the most of the silly situations. Caan is his usually serious, solid self, and Deschanell, who usually does more independent type movies, is a delight. And what a nice voice she has!. Asner is a good Santa, and I believe I have seen him in the role somewhere else as well. I have always loved Bob Newhart, and it was nice to see him in a big film. I just wished there was more of him. A great soundtrack filled with holiday favorites and other nice little nuggets pepper the film. The look of the film is pretty nice as well. Nothing beats New York at Christmas time. The design of the North Pole is hilarious, as it reminds us of those old 60's and 70's TV specials we all grew up on. The animated critters and a walking and talking snowman(voiced by the mysterious singer Leon Redbone, who also contributed to the soundtrack), also give those nostalgic little touches. The DVD extras are also a nice batch of goodies. I especially like the 10 minute section on people who really decorate big time for the holiday, and a section on Christmas in Hollywood. There is lots more here, and they are all fun and entertaining for a pretty fun, entertaining, and ultimately harmless little movie. Merry Christmas!.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I am far to young to know anything about the life and term of Robert McNamera so I feel I am qualified to rate this film in an unbiased manner. Every citizan in the U.S. Should watch this movie as soon as possible. Perhaps you will notice the same arguements used to invade Vietnam as those used to invade Iraq. The old saying goes that those who ignore history are compelled to repeat it. We are repeating history and how many more of soldiers must die for a lie? How do you ask that last man to die for a lie? How do you explain to his mother or father that their son or daughter died for a lie?

B0002TT0NW|5.0|The complaints by the purists miss the point that the Potter books are a little too crowded and disorganized.  The first 2 movies followed the books closely and, no surprise, were too crowded and disorganized.  Cuaron edits and streamlines in a way that Rowling seems unable to do: he's a better storyteller.  I'm glad he didn't include endless boring quidditch scenes, etc. etc.  He did fail to explain a couple of small details, but overall this is an example of superior directing.
B0006399FS|5.0|The very first time I heard 'Oops I did it again' by Britney Spears I secretly thought it was very catchy.  Now its irritating.  The first five times I heard Exile on Main Street by the Stones (and at the time I loved all their hits) I thought it was terrible.  Same with 'Pleased to Meet Me' by the Replacements.  Good music takes time to seap in. This is how Achtung Baby was for me.  But if I play it while driving, while getting ready to head out for the night, on a jog, at a party....I slowly start to discern little bits here and there and notes and words and beats....This release took about 10 listens all the way through, in about a weeks time, and now I would put it up there with the best of their material.  My only complaint is most songs and the album is too short. Favorites are #3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11, like #2 and 9, and not a big fan of #1, 4 and 6.  Keep listening and you will find it is at least a 4.5 star album if you like u2 even just a little.  Can't wait to see and hear these tunes live, even Vertigo might grow on me
B00005K3O4|5.0|The whole movie is cheesy, but you cant help but love it. Although I just recently upgraded from VHS to the DVD which was only $7.50 at walmart... so sorry amazon... walmart has cheaper cheesy... but other then that this movie is a total classic and i suggest buying it for the clown phobic friend:)
B000002UA9|5.0|Why do I say this is the best album ever? Because it is so enjoyable! All songs make you dance happily. I Saw Her Standing There is a mighty bass song. Misery is a nice song too. Anna has great George backing vocals. Chains is a so-so song compared to the other masterpieces. Boys is fun. Ask Me Why, another so-so. Please Please Me gets better each time you listen to it. Love Me Do has this feel that makes it somehow less enjoyable but still a good song. P.S. I Love You is a great McCartney song that I love. Baby It's You is easily the best here. Do You Want To Know A Secret is a song that George sings but was written by John. It is awesome! A Taste Of Honey has cheesy lyrics but it owns too. There's A Place has got a REAL GOOD BRIDGE! Twist And Shout has a story behind it.  <br />As you guys might now, this was recorded in one day. It was the end of the day, and only one song was left for recording. It was Twist And Shout. The only problem was, John had no voice left... The guys in the studio took him to a cafeteria where he had hot milk. Then they came back, for a challenge in Beatle story not seen until Magical Mystery Tour - Playing Twist And Shout. Lennon was shirtless and people were practically holding him so he didn't collapse. So it began. As you may notice, it has amazing guitar, drums and vocals. Ringo had to do some insanely hard drumming patterns - If he failed, game over! They wouldn't have been able of recording Twist And Shout. George didn't make a single mistake. They all played extremely well - Making a wonderful perfomance, especially John.  <br />Unaware of what would happen, the boys released the disc some days later. They became the greatest. <br />We learn that only if you do like John and kill yourself while singing is when you're able of recording a disc as good as this. Best ever.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I loved that Echo and the Bunnymen were used to open up this movie. The killing moon is a great song.<br /><br />Anyways....the only reason I understood this movie was because I bought the DVD and I watched the cut scenes with the director's commentery. I got lost somewhere and could not quite wrap my brain around what happened. But, it all came together with the director's explaination and I found that to be unfortunate because this could have been a terrific movie. It just missed something and I am still trying to figure out what that was. My poor 15 year old daughter STILL doesn't get it. Anyways, it is worth watching Jake Gyllenhall (he's awesome) and Patrick Swayze as a freaky inspirational speaker.
B0002SROT0|4.0|There are few songwriters who can match Elliott Smith's work song for song.  He had the ability to weave harrowing, edge of life lyrics to some of the most melodic melodies not written by Lennon/McCartney.  The first album to be released after (I'm sure there will be more) Elliott's unfotunate demise last year, From a Basement On The Hill picks up from where Figure 8 left off three years ago.  Considering that it was a work in progress, it is of excellent quality with no weak tracks, and several such as MEMORY LANE, COAST TO COAST and LET'S GET LOST ranking with cream of his previous work.<br /><br />Many of Smith's fans are split between his early mostly acoustic releases and his later fully produced epics.  I find a fault with neither, the acoustic ones highlight his raw nerve lyrical side and the production  on the later underline what a great songwriter and craftsman he was.  That being said, I do find the production on this one a little too thick at times, swallowing or obscuring the vocals on a number of tracks.
B00065GX64|5.0|The reviewer J. Herman listed below has a good point about the many redundant Special Editions released lately, but from what I've read I'm certain this Criterion rerelease is different.  Criterion's original \\"M\\" is not the best looking DVD, so when new materials popped up that would make for a better transfer and a better picture, they decided to release a new version.  And I guess while they were at it, they added a second disc of extras.  \\"M\\" is a masterpiece that creeps up on you--like many Fritz Lang films, it gets better over several viewings and after you've seen more of his films.  I also recommend The Testament of Dr. Mabuse and Fritz Lang's Indian Epic on DVD, as well as his harder to find American works like Rancho Notorious, Fury, While The City Sleeps and Hangmen Also Die.
B00005JL78|4.0|...this being a Spielberg movie, I was just cringing in anticipation of his inevitable schmaltzy happy Hollywood ending to a surprisingly (for him) thought-provoking and unpredictable film.  Those rather un-Spielbergian qualities mainly come from the fact that \\"Minority Report\\" is based on a short story by the heavyweight postmodern writer Phillip K. Dick, who also wrote the book from which the classic existentialist-sci-fi film \\"Blade Runner\\" (directed by the relatively schmaltz-free Ridley Scott) was adapted.<br /><br />And true to form, Spielberg doesn't disappointment---our hero seems to be defeated, only to be rescued and rise from the ashes of his apparent destruction to rid us of the Insidious Bad Guy, and closes out the movie back in the saddle with his Major Romantic Interest who's shown growing a belly about the size of a Volkswagen just before the final credits, which are of course accompanied by the Designated Uplifting And Bombastic Orchestral Score of John Williams.<br /><br />Now that you know the usual Spielbergian/Hollywood focus-group-bootlicking ending---and to its credit, this ending is not immediately apparent during the FIRST ten minutes of the movie, unlike most Hollywood blockbusters---you can sit back and enjoy the first 95% of the film.  Spielberg gets to go beserk with all sorts of technological gizmos since this film is of course set in the future, and there are a couple of somewhat original action/fight scenes to keep us entertained throughout.<br /><br />What makes the film more than the usual Hollywood puke of brainless special effects showboating but actually INTERESTING however, is the plot and subtext as supplied by Phillip K. Dick---which is to say, the conflict between technology, humanity, and metaphysics.  This being a Spielberg film it never gets anywhere as dark and disturbing as Dick's work usually is, unfortunately.  But there is still enough Dick in there to outweigh the worst of Spielberg, at least until the last 5 minutes which I recommend you watch while drinking copious amounts of alcohol or some other brain-deadening activity.<br /><br />Just makes you wonder how much better this film could've been, in the hands of a director like Ridley Scott or Terry Gilliam.  Oh well, at least Spielberg didn't excrete another God-forsaken schmaltz-orgy like his recent \\"The Terminal.\\"5 minutes which I recommend you watch while drinking copious amounts of alcohol or some other brain-deadening activity.   <br /> <br />Just makes you wonder how much better this film could've been, in the hands of a director like Ridley Scott or Terry Gilliam.  Oh well, at least Spielberg didn't excrete another God-forsaken schmaltz-orgy like his recent \\"The Terminal.\\"
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I see that Alicia has taken it up a notch for the first two songs excluding the intro. Though most of her songs i found to be slow and didn't have much variety to it. It wi very similar to her first album. The background vocals are similar as well as the beats and the slow tempo. I give 3 stars because she hasn't really spread her wings to find a new noise except for Karma and Heartburn. I also found the phone conversation on You Don't Know My Name to be kinda silly and long. Alicia needs more funky beats and innovative tunes in her music. Though some slow songs are good.
078401213X|5.0|Certainly much more original and engaging than Aranofsky's subsequent \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\"<br /><br />Max Cohen is probably a totally made-up character (I haven't bothered to Google him yet) but the skill and power of this film is evidenced by the fact that I would actually want to check up on him before saying whether he is or is not fictional.<br /><br />Aranofsky's camera and visual style is ideal for the subject matter at hand: he takes us inside the mind and daily experience of an isolated, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, borderline schizoid, physically and mentally unwell mathematical prodigy who is consumed by his quest to find The Ultimate (Mathematical) Formula Behind All Existence.  A sort of Holy Grail if you wish, only derived by indecipherable walls of numbers and equations flashing through Max's head and his computer which he has relentlessly crunching numbers 24/7.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Requiem For A Dream,\\" this is pretty original stuff and Aranofsky manages to pull off a resolution which is sufficiently ambiguous to avoid being glib or trite but still fairly satisfying for the viewer.<br /><br />Worth several watches, maybe with a fair amount of slow-mo to capture much of the light-speed imagery and jump cuts.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|There are a lot of crack users on Amazon, apparently.    This movie is not funny.  It has an occasional moment here or there, and the ending is really, really funny.  But for the most part?  Terrible.      Again, the biggest problem is it isn't funny.  The main character is an unlikeable loser.  Usually a movie will have a loveable loser, but this guy is a jack-off and a half.  Meanwhile, so is his brother and his uncle.      There are only two characters that don't make you want to kill them, or yourself.  Those are the love interest and Pedro.  Both characters are nice people.  EVERYONE else in this movie is a terrible character and NOT funny.    Did I mention this isn't funny?    Don't waste your time, and especially don't waste your money.  You'll be REALLY pissed off.  Unless you're a teenager that has been led by MTV to believe this tripe is hilarious, you will hate it with the vile that I have for it.    I also find it funny, WAY funnier than this movie, that everyone who liked it (ALL under 21) voted that my review wasn't useful.  Over 100 responses!  NICE!  Or as your hero, that dork Napolean, would say, SWEET!
B000002MFE|4.0|Eric Clapton Unplugged(1992). Eric Clapton's First Acoustic Live Album.<br /><br />In 1992, at the height of the Grunge and Alternative scene, guitar virtuoso Eric Clapton, who lost many fans and critics during his 80's career, burst back onto the music scene with 'Eric Clapton Unplugged', a performance that marketed such hits as 'Tears For Heaven' and an alternate version of 'Layla', and earning him an armful of Grammy's in the process. Many other groups, including Nirvana and Alice In Chains, produced legendary 'Unplugged' albums, but none matched the success of Clapton's, which sold millions and millions of copies, becoming the most successful release of his career, which was previously '451 Ocean Boulevard'. To this day, any Classic Rock aficianado owns 'Eric Clapton Unplugged', and, it is remarkable to achieve such sucess with one man just sitting down and playing an acoustic guitar. So, is 'Unplugged' just an overrated borefest, or a great success? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Signe- 'Unplugged' is opened up by \\"Signe\\", a short instrumental track that is a nice little jazz and folk influenced jam.<br /><br />Before You Accuse Me- A cover of Bo Diddley's classic blues tune, \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" is a powerful, sarcastic blues song with a piercing blues guitar riff. Clapton does a great job with the singing and guitarwork here, and his cover easily lives up to the original.<br /><br />Hey Hey- Another blues classic, \\"Hey Hey\\" is a slower, jazzier blues tune, complete with Eric Clapton's lustful vocals and his fiery blues licks. Hard not to like!<br /><br />Tears In Heaven- The song that caused 'Unplugged's popularity to skyrocket, \\"Tears In Heaven\\" finds Clapton mournfully remembering his son Conor. \\"Tears In Heaven\\" is a jazzy song, but has Clapton playing a classical guitar melody, and reminds me a little of \\"Dust In The Wind\\". Although overrated, definitely one of Clapton's strongest.<br /><br />Lonely Stranger- A song that stands out, \\"Lonely Stranger\\" is a jazzy, R&B-ish tune that finds Clapton playing a folk-styled guitar and brooding in his gravelly vocals. Another track that stands out!<br /><br />Nobody Knows When You're Down & Out- A jazzy rocker with influences of Soul and Blues, \\"Nobody Knows When You're Down & Out\\" combines Clapton's acoustic jazz with a very Broadway style piano to create a song that sounds oddly like Toy Story's \\"You've Got A Friend\\".<br /><br />Layla- A huge hit to begin with, this alternate acoustic version of \\"Layla\\" has gained almost as much legend status as the original. This version combines Clapton's sultry acoustic guitarmanship with the very jazzy keyboard melody, not to mention Clapton's lovelorn singing.<br /><br />Runnin' On Faith- \\"Runnin' On Faith\\" is a Country and Soul type song, with an out-of-tune guitar melody and an uplifting keyboard harmony. Clapton sings his heart out, and his emotion lifts up this slow tune to great heights.<br /><br />Walkin' Blues- After a few folk and country rockers, Eric Clapton hits back with \\"Walkin' Blues\\", a typical blues song, with slurred vocals, unfortuneate lyrics, and in-your-face guitarmanship. While I may like the Blues, this song seems just a little too repetitive. Not bad.<br /><br />Alberta- An 'Unplugged' highlight, \\"Alberta\\" is a jazzy show tune type song that's infected with a touch of Gospel and R&B. Clapton pours his heart out over Alberta, and around his swirling mix of guitar chords and piano melodies, his emotion can be felt.<br /><br />San Francisco Bay Blues- Eric Clapton continues with what he does best on \\"San Francisco Bay Blues\\", strumming all the right notes on his guitar and letting his emotion truly be felt through his voice on this bluegrass-influenced blues song. How can you resist the digiredo solo?<br /><br />Malted Milk- Another blues song, Clapton relates malted milk to \\"his loving\\" on \\"Malted Milk\\", a slow blues song that has very little to offer other than Clapton's singing and anice little blues guitar solo. Not his best.<br /><br />Old Love- A track with a striking resemblance to \\"Layla\\", \\"Old Love\\" is a rock ballad, leaving out some of Clapton's blues influences, instead focusing on the mix of his pulsing acoustic guitarwork, hard hitting keyboards, and growly vocals. A nice addition.<br /><br />Rollin' & Tumblin'- Instead of those slow blues ballads, Clapton dishes out a fast and guitar-driven blues rocker that'll be sure to get your feet tapping. Clapton's addictive guitar melody fits perfectly with his gravelly blues vocals. One of the best songs on 'Unplugged'.<br /><br />Overall, 'Unplugged', while being a great look into one of Rock and Blues' guitars greatest heroes, and showing more emotion than almost every \\"nu\\" band has, Clapton's performance is sometimes redundant and marred by weak covers. Although many songs here would have been better changed to Clapton's own pieces, 'Unplugged' is still a decidedly good album, yet its loftly place in Rock N' Roll lore might be just a little too high. Clapton is in top shape here, and his acoustic guitar and voice shine, even without the massive production values. If Clapton had put more of his own popular centerpieces here instead of slow blues tracks, I would be a bigger fan of 'Unplugged', yet it fails to touch his Cream or most of his solo material.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF THE BLUES OR ERIC CLAPTON! IF YOU DON'T LIKE BLUES, DO NOT(DO NOT!) GET THIS ALBUM, AS THERE IS ALMOST NONE OF CLAPTON'S ROCK MATERIAL! OVERRATED, YET STILL VERY GOOD!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- Tears In Heaven, Before You Accuse Me, Layla, Rollin' & Tumblin', and Hey Hey.<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!her than Clapton's singing and a nice little blues guitar solo.

B00005JNEI|1.0|I saw this movie with an open mind, and thought to myself \\"that's it?\\"  The entire affair screams \\"FILM SCHOOL.\\"  Here is the moment where we get the slow motion, heart-wrenching footage!  Now we have the ironic twist, and the witty voice-overs! <br /> <br />Granted, there are a few issues that Moore brings up that warrent further analysis, like the massive Saudi investment in the US, and how it can create conflicts of interest among politicians.  But the moment the film starts getting interesting, it switches gears, and begins a long, hysterical, tirade against Bush and his Iraq policy.  There are long, long, sequences, without dialogue, in which we are shown exploded bombs, and weeping mothers.  I felt like I was watching something Joseph Goebbels put together.  Many of the \\"facts\\" are not even accurate.  The Saudi citizens in the US did not fly out under the flight ban -it was afterwards.  FOX News initially said that Gore had won Florida, not Bush, the list goes on and on.  The worst thing about it, is that Moore knows he is manipulating facts, and yet does so with impunity. <br /> <br />I was also hoping for some humor.  I didn't find any.  I simply don't find Moore to be particularly funny.  He also has a poor speaking voice.  the next time he does a film, he should get an actor to read the script for him. <br /> <br />The only reason this film won any awards is because of the politics behind it.  Liberal Democrats and Socialists loved the film, but it wasn't because it was entertaining.  It was boring!
B00029LNHS|5.0|Of all the negative reviews I've seen of this cd, the biggest complaint seems to be about the song \\"Lets Get Retarded.\\" People, you need to get over it! It is just a word, let it go! The cd as a whole is very impressive and enjoyable. If you are a fan of music you'll appreciate this album very much. I highly reconmend it to anyone who likes music.
B000000OR9|5.0|Enough has been said in the other reviews I read but I'll say this - even after listening to this CD well over a hundred times in the past 10 years I still get chills from some of the incredible soaring riffs from Sykes and the awesome rythm section of Tony and Carmine.  Totally under-rated players.  I recently saw Sykes touring with the other original members of Thin Lizzy (sans Lynott) and he continues to amaze.  I just ordered the Live Lizzy they put out from the tour and can't wait to hear it.  Buy this and CRANK IT UP!
1401301010|5.0|I usually avoid autobiographies (\\"me-moirs\\"), but I'm glad I read this one. The book is written in a very approachable, friend-to-friend voice. So you feel like you're listening to someone you know tell his life story to you on a long train ride or something. And you hang on every word because his life has been so interesting. Plus, he tells his story with a lot of introspection and with a sense of humor. So you think things through and laugh right along with him. He does seem a little self-congratulatory on his extraordinary sex life (for example, I wondered why he chose to show topless photos in the book of 2 of his more important girlfriends). He also seems a little detached about his childhood (there's got to be some anger in there somewhere.) But really these anomalies just add to many fascinating points of interest in a very honest, giving, and brave book.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is a fascinating documentary made all the more exceptional by Errol Morris' unique filmmaking style, an uncanny ability to allow his subjects to reveal their inner truths without forcing them out. Constructed around two three-hour, sit-down interviews, this film focuses on the 85-year old Robert McNamara, former Secretary of Defense under JFK and LBJ and still very much a controversial historical figure for his purported role in escalating the Vietnam War. Filmed in 2001 but released last year, it avoids the feel of a purely \\"talking head\\" approach by including haunting archival footage and rare, unheard audio tapes, all accompanied by Phillip Glass' melancholy score, the combination of which makes for riveting, sometimes troubling viewing.<br /><br />One particularly difficult episode has nothing to do with the Vietnam War. It's about his role on General Curtis LeMay's team during WWII, when the frighteningly hawkish LeMay decided to firebomb 67 Japanese cities, killing 100,000 Tokyo civilians in one night alone in 1945. Ghostly numbers appear with visuals of falling bombs, while McNamara breaks down as he describes the horror, fully realizing the extent of his war crimes had the Japanese been victorious. Even though the raids received less press than the atomic bomb drops, they took as many casualties. McNamara offers no apology, but does \\"empathize with the enemy\\", one of his eleven key lessons, even showing some personal remorse for his accountability. In fact, later under JFK, he recognized how Khrushchev wanted to avert war while saving face during the Cuban missile crisis, and consequently avoided a colder war than had existed. But McNamara failed to apply this lesson to Vietnam. When asked whether he feels any guilt about his role in Vietnam, he clams up and states that he's already said all he's going to say about it. Yet, he breaks down again when he recalls the impact of the Vietnam War on his wife and three children, all opposed to the war. He goes so far as to acknowledge that the traumas associated with his tenure as secretary may have ultimately killed his wife. It is a painful and poignant moment, but McNamara feels compelled, even when stricken with grief, to footnote that moment with the disclosure that they \\"were some of the best years of our life\\" and that \\"all members from my family benefited\\" from his days in Washington.  The film gets rather gun-shy (pardon the pun) when explaining the relevance of lesson #9 (\\"Never apply military force unilaterally\\") to the current Iraqi conflict. Morris actually goes to great lengths to point out that this comment has nothing to do with Iraq or 9/11, and McNamara refuses to make his life lessons relevant to current U.S. military policy and speak against the assault on Iraq.<br /><br />Even more than his actual words are the posture and oratory style by which McNamara expresses his viewpoints and recalls events. Didactic and always in control, McNamara asserts his intelligence lucidly, and despite his age, he seems to be in perfect command of his memory. Physically, he is unsurprisingly frailer nearly forty years after the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. There are moments of honest reflection that Morris captures unobtrusively, and McNamara remains amazingly alert, articulate and at times, charming. It does seem ironic that lesson #11 (\\"You can't change human nature') even suggests the possibility that the previous ten lessons are meaningless. McNamara himself says, \\"Never answer the question that is asked of you. Answer the question that you wished had been asked of you.\\" This seems to sum up his participation in this documentary, as he answers what he wants and ignores the rest, the same approach he has taken in justifying Vietnam. A complicated man piercingly captured by a master filmmaker.s so far as to acknowledge that the traumas associated with his tenure as secretary may have ultimately killed his wife.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I received a special preview copy of the 40th anniversary of Marry Poppins DVD edition. I must say I spend two whole days reviewing the special features. It is amazing and a must have DVD for the Holidays and all year long.<br /><br />This DVD edition is remastered in the DISNEYS' THX home Theatre set up. The audio is incredible and the restored print is amazing bright, vibrant and textured. The movies are toted as Walt's best achievement ever. And it has everything you would want in a film for the entire family including a break down of sing-a-long songs.<br /><br />40th Anniversary DVD contains:<br /><br />A special audio commentary track with the none other than Academy Award Winning JULIE ANDREWS (The Sound of Music, The Princess Diaries, 10) and DICK VAN DYKE (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Bye Bye Birdie, The Dick Van Dyke Show) themselves. Reminiscing about the music, production and even Mr. Walt Disney himself. Also on the track is Karen Dotrice (Many Lives of Thomasina) who plays young Jane Banks and composer Robert Sherman (All the Disney Classics). They all seem to speak fondly of the shoot, the cast and crew and especially have some funny memories of the production itself.<br /><br />A MAGICAL REUNINION: There is a great walk down \\"memory lane\\" with Robert Sherman, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews. They musically review through stories and example of the songs and how the evolution occurred. Dick van Dyke is amazing enthusiastically about his part as Bert. Julie discusses everything from the children to learning about making her very first film ever.<br /><br />THE MAKING OF MARRY POPPINS: Is an amazing visual and educational look at the making of the film. This is the longest of the extra features and goes in depth of the time, energies and efforts into making this Walt Disney classic. Filled with outtakes, behind the scenes footage and commentary from Julie and most of the cast, crew and musical influences of the film. It is hosted by - Dick Van Dyke (Bert) himself!<br /><br />Other features include Dick Van Dyke's original MAKE-UP test, THE GALA WORLD Premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and one of my favorites the DECONSTRUCTION of two scene that include the break down of special effects and animation and their elements being combined.<br /><br />I LOVE TO LAUGH - A game for the kids who have watched the movie and handle some visual trivia from the film.<br /><br />THE CAT THAT LOOKED AT THE KING: Finally there is an extra bonus of a great little new animated short that is from one of the original P.L. Travers books. Julie Andrews herself takes you through the adventure in a very \\"Marry Poppins\\" sort of way. Guest voices include David Ogden Stiers (Beauty and the Beast, M.A.S.H., Pocahontas), Tracey Ullman (The Tracy Ullman Show, I Love You To Death, Once Upon A Mattress) and England's own Sarah Ferguson.<br /><br />The film directed by Robert Stevenson  (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Love Bug, The Absent Minded Professor)  is an amazing piece of fun, entertainment and a true lesson in life and the love of family.

B00067BBQE|1.0|I love this band.  They are the only band I saw this year in concert.  However, I've downloaded a few non-official pro-shot shows that put this cluster-[...] of a production to absolute shame.  What a piece of [...]. Let's see how many cuts we can make in the least amount of time possible.  I saw more of the band standing on the floor 100 feet from the damn stage using my buddy's binoculars than this absolute sham of a live video. Note to the band : The behind the scenes footage and bloopers were great and you're fun to watch..but fire the idiots who filmed/edited and/or produced this piece of [...]. Amy, you're listed as executive producer, so if that means you were involved in this...then as an executive producer, you're a great singer.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If this is all just such a \\"pack of lies\\"' then where are the lawsuits?  How did it get financed?  Who would float a film that was just a \\"pack of lies\\".  Oh well, what's done is done.  The man tried to show you, but you didn't want to see or believe it. Just remember folks, you get what you vote for.  I think that there are going to be some sobering surprises for us in the coming years, as the \\"conservatives\\" try to tell us all how to live.  You wanted it, you got it.
0385508417|3.0|While the movie, which I have not seen, rakes in tons of cash and gets panned by the critics I thought I would take a stab at the book first.  What I found was a book that was begging to be taken apart by the side of my brain that usually handles reviews.  Instead the pleasure side of my brain won out and I will recommend this book as a wholly enjoyable and fast read.  The issue that I had the biggest problem with was the way Grisham only goes half way in his attack on Christmas.  I understand that if his conclusion had been that skipping Christmas is actually a logical, intelligent thing to do that he would have lost tons of sales from country bumpkins who drank the Christmas Kool-Aid.  However, it would have won the hearts of Scrooge's, like myself, whose idea of getting into the Christmas spirit is to drink eggnog while watching \\"Bad Santa.\\"  Well, Grisham ultimately sells out and informs us that the giant Frosty's and drunken office parties are a good thing.  Of course, that gets Grisham in a bit of a bind when his villains have to suddenly become heroes, but I was willing to overlook that in the name of fun. . .and yuletide giving.  And it does serve as a reminder to all of you Frohmeyer's out there just how much time and life is wasted in the name of saturated materialism.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5
B0001AVZA8|4.0|this is a film that could use about 20 min of cuts. the first hour where nicholson and keaton are dancing around each other is charming and witty. but the second hour after they've slept together is slow and ponderous. how many times do we need to see keaton sniffling? also, the resolution is too quick and facile. yeah, it's a romantic comedy, but...<br />all this aside, the performances are pretty good, especially by the two leads, which should come as no surprise since both are really just playing themselves.
B000009FHN|5.0|This is a great album that's easily one of the best ever, but there's no reason to buy this Japanese import. For one thing you could just buy the Crow soundtrack for Dead Souls, but now it's available on an official NIN release besides this one, the Deluxe Edition of the Downward Spiral. I give it 5 stars for the music, but this definitely isn't worth your money even if you're a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Take a trip back to 1971 with this dvd. I love the look and feel of this early film by Pink Floyd.They know how to stand out and this dvd delivers.I like the original band members as they were in those days, still young and bright with ideas.This is a great dvd for most but if you only like P/F for their Wall album, you may not get it. I had this movie on vhs but it was sold in a yard sell by accident. So I ordered the dvd.If your a true Pink Floyd fan then buy this dvd.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania is the total package and so is her first Greatest Hits album.  I always thought that each of her albums were a greatest hits album because she packs each project with quality songs, but this is the best of the best.  The three new songs are all wonderful and different.  Shania just keeps getting better and better.  She the only singer that I can listen and listen and listen to and never tire of.
B00005MAM2|2.0|I didn't see this movie until about 3 years or so ago, and I will be the first to tell you, OVERRATED! This movie did not live up to the hype that I was expecting. First off, the plot is good, but from about the middle on just was, for lack of a better word, wierd. I don't think this should be the first thing people think when they hear the word Anime. The ending is soo strange that I made the decision to not see this again. The characters were also odd. To say the least you can do a lot better when it comes to anime, try Cowboy Bebop if you want a great anime (the show or the movie, they're both great!). Yes, 2 stars, and I'm still hesitant to give it even that many.
B0000E5NPZ|4.0|i've seen this movie several times on TV in the past...<br /><br />Oh, it's a perfecly charming movie, especially for the not TOO young amongst us, who probably remember the older times in Paris and France best. For ME: I'd buy this film because it is one of those rare moments to see Juliette Gr&eacute;co in action.<br /><br />Gr&eacute;co was extremely popular in the fifties as an avantgarde singer/ actress. Those were the days of the \\"existentialists\\" .I've met Miss Gr&eacute;co personally and have been a fan of her art for years now.Where ever she's got a concert, you can hear a pin drop .....soooo different if you compare it too many concerts of todays artists. Miss Gr&eacute;co you could call the true follow up of that other great French singer , PIAF !<br /><br />so If you get the chance to see this movie, watch Juliette Gr&eacute;co<br /><br />in her small part and see if you're too under her spell....
B0006399FS|5.0|To be honest, I wasn't too impressed with All That You Can't Leave Behind.  Despite that, Beautiful Day remains one of my favorite songs of theirs, if not my very favorite.  And it's no wonder I fell for Atomic Bomb very quickly.  It fit everything I love about U2.  How can I even describe it? <br />  It wasn't an album I listened to for the first time and thought \\"I don't get it.\\"  I got it right away.  I expected a complete drop off of interest in the rest of the album after Vertigo.  That seems to happen with a LOT of albums, doesn't it?  The first song is great, but then you start watching the time of each song to see if it's almost done. <br />  All that didn't happen.  Bono was soaring, the Edge was very reminiscent of his work in The Unforgettable Fire.  But, it was more than that.  Anybody can mention Bono as \\"soaring\\", but it's the kind of feeling I got from listening to these songs that made me yearn.  Listen to City of Blinding Lights!  Songs like that bring such a sense of hope and (spiritual) freedom.  It's so hard to explain.  And nobody else but U2 can bring that feeling of inspiration and joyfulness.  Hmmm... Bono's opening melody of A Man And A Woman made me recall a certain Beatles song...  \\"I read the news today, oh boy....\\"  The opening melodies sound so similar, but it's a great melody that I kept humming today.  \\"Little sister, don't you worry bout a thing today.\\"  Maybe you know what I'm talking about. <br />   Thanks U2, you woke me up again.
B00008EYA5|2.0|Old slug-eyebrows Colin Farrell has suddenly become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Unfortunately it will be short lived unless he takes a script thats not laughable. Prime example is his co-star Samuel Jackson, he takes way too many everage scripts, and while successfully boosts the film, his repertoire cruises downhill. Slug eyebrows needs to learn this, if he's going to be remembered he needs to reject corn on the cob scripts like SWAT.<br /><br />'Do you feel me' - 'Yeah I feel you' has won the award for most cringingly corny confrontation this year. The film just wanders around until it comes to its anti-climatic insignificant ending where not even the goodys get anything special. I mean what is a Hollywood blockbuster when the heroes don't walk away with a girl, or 1000 billion dollars? While Jackson brings a rather tired performance he's still worth watching, only to take your eyes off those slugs.<br /><br />Why do Americans think that SWAT are the 'most respected' or generally 'bestest' team in the 'world'?. What about the Ghurkas? The SAS who are far more efficient than SWAT. I think they meant America, not 'world'.<br /><br />Hopefully slugbrows will stop taking films like this, the same goes for Jackson, but we all know thats never going to happen. The Recruit is his best to this day, ans SWAT his worst.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|The review by Doughty says it all: \\"However, the staggering tragedy of this film is its unforgivable failure to involve, despite the dramatic gift of being set in a sub, a surefire claustrophia-filled setting. Instead, it becomes a comedy for all the wrong reasons.\\"<br /><br />But also this from Eldon Curtis: \\"For the most part, German sailors were committed nationalists, but not usually ardent Nazis, and would be just as appalled as any sailor by the idea of shooting up lifeboats.\\"<br /><br />Another scene where the audience will frown comes near the beginning: The American mission briefer sternly warns that our inability to read the German code is losing the war for us. What a load of hype, oh PUH-LEAZE!<br /><br />Such an historically disrespectful film is unlikely to be produced very often in Britain or Germany, so thank God Hollywood still cranks out such junk for us to aim our spitballs at the screen.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Now when someone says the worst Godsmack album and gives it 4 stars, you know that it's from a true fan.  I also never listen to the radio.  Thus, I am not tired of songs ever being overplayed unless they are shoved into movies and commercials.  With that out of the way I present my review of Faceless.    I waited very impatiently for this album to come out.  I listened to their self title and awake for days on end to \\"pump myself up\\" before listening to it.  I ran to the store the day it came, out purchased it while it was on sale. And put in my CD player.  My finale conclusion/result was that Faceless is a good CD, but it doesn't live up to the standards set by the previous 2 records.  And I'll admit, I was deeply saddened by Drummer Tommy Stewart leaving Godsmack and joining the far lesser band known as Lo Pro.  While Shannon Larkin is an excellent drummer as well, it isn't the same.  The drumming change is definitely noticeable, and quite frankly it isn't as captivating, so to say.      The major issue here is that there are definitely some songs here that could be considered filler or sub par to what they have pulled off in the past.  None of them are horrible though.  I can listen to all Godsmack albums without ever feeling the urge to press the skip button.  (Sometimes I feel an urge to skip, but I don't and let it play)  Certain songs like the title track, Changes, Re-align (acoustic version is remarkably better), Dead and Broken and the intro called awakening.  In all honesty they should have just called the Awakening, the Journey part 2, because it's nothing more then a rehashed idea, but it is carried out better, it's more than a minute.  The majority of the other songs are great too, but once again the change is noticeable.  I guess it's something that just bugs me.  Standouts would be The rest of the songs I haven't mentioned.  Also, when I first heard Serenity, I thought it was an abomination.  The second time I heard it, it thought it was perfect.  Ihave absolutely no idea what was going through my head that first time, but then again, I'm an odd person. It may take a while to grow on you if you don't like it at first.      Faceless is a good album, not their best, but still good (yeah, I know, I've said that a lot).  I was skeptical of what direction Godsmack was going to go, but then they released the Other Side and that brought me back.  The version of Re-Align, on the Other Side actually outdoes the original somehow.  Anyways, Faceless is good record.  Hoped this helped.
B0000TB05A|5.0|In the 25 years of its existence, U2 has done more than any other band to bring feeling, soul and emotion into live rock  concert shows. Words cannot fully express how wonderful their music is - it is full af joy, hope, doubt, burning conviction, fear, truth and triumph. Anyone with a heart can respond to these great songs. This concert is from 2001, and was filmed at Slane Castle. Not far from Dublin (the hometown of all four members of U2), this stately country house should be recognisable to fans as the venue for the recording of 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire (it appears on the cover of that album).  <br /> <br />This show features songs from the Elevation tour of 2001, a year of triumph and tragedy for the band as they performed brilliantly across the world's stages, yet were sadly bereaved by the passing of frontman Bono's father Bob in May 2001(shortly before this show was filmed). Despite this, Bono is in terrific form here, and a celebratory rather than sad feeling permeates the film.  <br /> <br />Tracks:  <br />Elevation - loud, punchy rocker & great starter track <br />  <br />Beautiful Day - great song, wonderful reception by crowd <br /> <br />Until The End Of THe World - atmospheric, deep track from Achtung Baby very good <br /> <br />New Year's Day - the first U2 song I ever heard (from 1983) this is a magical performance showcasing the Edge's guitar and keyboard playing <br /> <br />Out Of Control - This is FANTASTIC !! I love the idea of U2 presenting this very-early tearaway adolescent rocker as \\"our first single\\" as if they are debuting their act all over again. A surprise delight for longterm fans who may never have heard U2 play this one live. <br /> <br />Sunday Bloody Sunday - Larry's drums really make this track work well. A timeless song urging opposition to war and conflict. <br /> <br />Wake Up Dead Man - slow acoustic despair-filled number segues into... <br />Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of - This is an uplifting soul song andI love it. It's the perfect antidote to Wake Up Dead Man. <br /> <br />Kite - song dedicated to Bono's dad shines rather than palls <br /> <br />Angel Of Harlem - Every U2 show I've been to or seen on TV has them singing this fabulous crowd-pleasing singalong tune from Rattle & Hum <br /> <br />Desire - same album but a basic two-note stomper and another great past hit <br /> <br />Staring At The Sun - another acoustic guitar song performed on the front of the stage. Works well <br /> <br />All I Want Is You - the second delightful surprise of the disc. I love this song and have never seen them play it on TV or live in concert before. Wonderful <br /> <br />Where The Streets Have No Name - This is for me U2's greatest song. It sends shivers up my spine every time I hear its wonderful ringing guitar chords and inspiring lyrics. Thiis performance leads on directly from the previous track with that glorious introduction and beautiful orange glowing light. I cannot praise this highly enough.  <br /> <br />Bullet The Blue Sky - The full version of this dramatic , controversial song from The Joshua Tree album is performed here. Much better feel than on the Rattle & Hum movie. This is the best version of this great song available to own on disc. <br /> <br />With Or Without You - Again off Joshua Tree, another classic and well done here <br /> <br />One - A magical performance of this great song. My second favourite U2 song ever. <br /> <br />Walk On - I was so glad they came back for an encore to do this one straight after One. This was the key song on the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind and finished this glorious concert with a great message of hope.  <br /> <br />No-one else in rock music could play such a great set of songs.  <br />DO NOT be without a copy of this disc!!!!! <br /> <br />I'd give it 6 stars if the scale would let me!! <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005YUPO|2.0|I've got a 2 year old and a 3 1/2 year old, and I was tempted to buy the Einstein videos based on word of mouth, but decided to try a neighbors copy first.  Unfortunately, I wasn't all that impressed. More importantly, my kids seemed disinterested.  I've read a few of the unfavorable reviews I've seen lately and have to agree with their opinions.  Another Mom friend recommended a new series that just cam out called \\"Lots To Learn\\"  There are two available that I've seen: Lots To Learn: Nature, and Lots To Learn: In My House.  I've watched Nature and we all love it. I'm going to purchase Lots To Learn: In My House \\" next, and I'll let you know my feedback, but they seem to be more educational and less condescending to the kids, more professionally produced like Sesame street.
B000084T18|4.0|Alright.. so y'all that \\"diss\\" 50 cent seem to think that they some how know something about hip hop music... alright 50 cent's current albums may not be lyrically impressive.. but that's not everything..although he doesn't make the beats for his songs... they are still good...anybody heard his old albums or him battling would know that he can flow..but even his songs on his debut album aren't bad.. your just in amazement that what he raps about is the truth.. that he isn't a fake \\"gangster\\" like others pretend to be...yes i love 2pac.. and anybody who knows anything about 2pac would know that he was not a \\"gangster\\" he just wrote music to represent that aspect of African American lifes.. but even though he wasn't the gangster he said he was...he was a genius.. a poet...they are many different variations of hip hop.. 50 cent makes party music.. club music...let's go to a club and listen to some hieroglyphics...yeah?... don't get me wrong their one of my favs.. just a different style of hip hop...anybody who should be a true critic to music should have respect for all kinds.. or just be dumb and hate his music because you thought you were badass for doing a search on the internet and finding some amazing underground hip hop..then hearing 50 cent and hating him because you liked his music that he flaunts his cash and he is real... and he is mainstream... but you have to feel cool and think that the only good hip hop is 2pac and underground? ... haha...
0670033693|5.0|I read a great many books and it is rare that I come across a book that gets under your skin, engrossing you, leaving you begging for more after you turn the last page. I felt like a lover had left me after I finished. I ached, understanding I could not pick up another book immediately. This is the best compliment possible, knowing that you did not want to leave this place, these characters that Mr. Johnson has created. This is not a mere mystery, and although it is a mystery, it contains so many magical qualities that send it soaring beyond the \\"airplane fodder\\" of so many mysteries. Chapter 12 alone is worth the price of this book. I cannot wait for more from this author.
B00030590I|4.0|With the plot twists and kung fu scenes like that of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' the movie 'Hero' stands alone in not only being a source of pure entertainment but of keeping the viewer informed and up to date on things and matters that shaped history. The movie starts out as the central character played by Jet Li by the name of Nameless. Essentially he is one that has very little identity and have become virtually a statistic of the emperor uniting all the fragmented lands and kingdoms in ancient China 2,000 years ago. The movie itself let us not forget that with advance historical achievements such as in this case a growing empire with its massive armies has to come about through obstacles that entails certain historical and cultural values. No one is not saying that in whatever shape or form how all empire is going to be. In this case   trying to break through the barrier of Nameless explaining to the emperor how he managed to kill the three assassins  who have been for the last ten years have been plotting the emperors death which turned out to be extremely false and flawed. Throughout the movie we see how through certain scenes how the emperor is vunerable such as 1)when two of the assassins were able three years prior to fight off three thousand of his best soldiers and 2)Nameless himself was able to get ten paces close enough to the emperor-whom we learned later on was himself part of the plot aiming to kill the emperor. The movie is rich in themes and effect. It doesn't leave to much anyone expectation anything left wide open or undiscussed. The plot development is strong and any weakness through the shift of the plot is made by the presence of a powerful army.  <br /> <br />Yet we must not take this the wrong way in any type of historical analogy. This empire came about as we watched the movies of the reluctance and perhaps even say courage of one of the earlier assasins to 'split' with the plan of 'going on' to assasinate the emperor. These decisionsare motivated by looking at the bigger picture or as some would say the 'totality.' Then again despite how powerful each of assasin were they were still human and often times caught up by hubris or by other human emotions such as love and loyalty. <br /> <br />The mistake I think people will make about this movie is to assume that all empires have been formed on maintaining 'universal peace' or as we have witnessed in the 50 or so years by 'human idealogy' such as controlling the very essence of life. They can be formed just by the winds of time and history itself. In this movie are some 19th German thinking such as controlling and swaying the masses like you read in Isaiah Berlin's 'The Crooked Timber of Humanity.' (sorry for anachronism) <br /> <br />Empires of the future will no doubt be formed in the acquisition of lands and countries and the use of the most powerful and destructive forces on earth. In today's time the mathmatics doesn't work with the dissolving state and institutions which is being reflected the physical world being crowded out the virtual world such that the future unlike 'Hero' won't have massive armies whose presence will strike fear but be rather something like anti-armies more like the formation of virtual states and labarotory engineering from birth until adult hood as the means of any forms of social policy. This has to come about through certain things among them a strong super technological revolution that will underscore most political science but on the other hand energies that has to be unleashed that will have to shape the line of war and political outcome. There are on the other hand will no doubt be Heros viewed in the as traitors or assassins but like Nameless --'buried as a hero.' <br />
B00005RZV4|3.0|There is really not much reason to own this CD because the live versions sound too much like the studio versions, except they don't seem to really grab you as much. A bit of a disappointment because Trent is so great live.
B0006284JQ|2.0|First of all I do love all the songs on the album, but most of them I already own on her normal cd's that came out not to long ago. In my opinion it is way to early in her career to have a \\"greatest hits album\\". Yes, I know shes been around for a few years...longer than most people expected, but she only has four albums, two of which weren't very good...Britney is a classic case of star that doesn't care what they do to their career so she has to get a greatest hits album out now before things goo to bad and everyone forgets about the mommy to be that had a select few years in the spotlight. I wouldn't recommend this album, everyone that is a britney spears fan already owns most of these song, but like two..its just like handing the already rich girl more of your hard earned money for no reason.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name -- epic, vivid, complex, sprawling, moving and brilliantly written, acted and directed. <br /> <br />The series is lovingly faithful to the facts, so much so that repeat viewings not only satisfy, they enrich the overall story. At first, although I was riveted by the first enstallments, I wasn't able to distinguish all of the characters; I could follow the plot just fine, but basically we're talking about a story populated by a lot of young guys in helmets and fatigues.  On repeat viewings, you're able to see background characters who will later come into the foreground, and this gives the series a fascinating complexity. <br /> <br />This is also a collection of excellent stories, made even more awe-inspiring by the fact that they're true.  The opening installment \\"Curahee\\" is a great prelude to the action, and a good introduction to the mindset of the men and what it takes to make a competent leader.  \\"Carantan\\" contains sequences as jolting as \\"Saving Pvt. Ryan.\\"  And the stand-out episode, \\"Bastogne,\\" is so harrowing and exhausting and affecting it makes one wonder why wars are fought at all.  Of course \\"Why We Fight,\\" in which Easy Company uncovers a concentration camp, ably answers that question. <br /> <br />One primary thought ricoched through my brain during this entire series: I am so glad I've never been in the situations those men were because I would've awful at it, I don't think I could've done it.  The secondary thought?  Gratitude that somebody else was able to do it.
B00005JLXE|5.0|WOW! DAREDEVIL the Director's Cut is GREAT! Too often alternate cuts of films never find their way out of the vault. Thanks to whoever thought this one should be seen and made it happen. It's a winner! Much more character development of Murdock, more grit than we saw previously, and I won't ruin all the alternate and added scenes but this is worth adding to your DVD or D.D. collections. I've had tree days and wtched it twice already. I liked the theatrical cut but LOVE this one. To refuse to buy this: you don't have to but giving it a low rating is foolish if you haven't seen it! RATE THE DVD. Don't give it a low rating because you don't want to pay for it! This is GREAT!
B00068IOWC|5.0|I believe that this is a great come back for U2 <br />Music that is real from the heart. <br />Vertigo is a powerfull song and motivational, <br />Sometimes you cant do it on your own is uplifting,  Bono wrote it for his father who died earlier this year. <br />One step closer and Original of the species are also some of my favorites. <br />This CD is cool in that it has \\"Music DVD\\" awesome
B00065U08Q|3.0|I have long been a fan of John Frusciante, since his debut solo recording &quot;Niandra La Des and Usually Just a T-shirt&quot; to this latest epic piece of musical genious. John has always been on the edge of insanity with his work, as can be heard in such pieces as Estress from his album &quot;Smile from the streets you hold&quot; and  Running away into you from his masterpiece debut album, and he continues his assault on mainstream pop music with a mind blowing fresh and long overdue album that can titilate the senses and expand the mind. <BR>John's music is that of a tortured brilliant man, those who hear it are captivated, though his time for radio play has not come yet, with a little luck and perhaps a push from the legions of Frusciante fans out there perhaps one day his sound will echoe through our malls and stores,in our homes and our cars while we drive to our mundane jobs, ripping apart the monotonous sounds of Brittney Spears and Eminem.
B00018D3RI|4.0|It's good this came out on dvd. It's a lot better than what's on TV today. Lots of action in these shows some episodes are defintely better than others. Some of my favorites are the first original pilot and when Hutch gets abducted and gangsters get him hooked on heroin. I also like the one where they go through the police acadamey with this guy and he's goes off into the military....the episode he uses them(unbeknownest to them he's working for thugs now trying to track down a witness against one of the thugs). Two real life detectives probaly couldn't see this much action but then again LA in the 80's with all the gangs and stuff maybe they could see that much action but it's just a show anyway.
B00018TI5E|4.0|Some have disputed whether or not John Frusciante is a genious or just a junkie being given too much credit because of his association with one of the biggest bands ever. This album sways from his usual experimental methodology and gives the listener something a little more concrete, without losing the artistic qualitiy that we have all come to know and respect from this solo artist with a conscience. <BR>One poigniant moment in the album comes with a track titled &quot;Song to sing when I'm lonely&quot;, a heartbreaking tale of society's two-faced hidden agenda ways and the way each of us hides who we truly are. <BR>John Frusciante will forever be a shining example of what indie music should be and what someone can create if they get away from the same benign rut which the music scene seems to have fallen into.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|The music is ragged, rough, and dirty...so it only makes sense that the look of this concert dvd should be too. Incredible, high-energy performance throughout nicely captured here. Jack plays and sings like a man possessed.... Check it out!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Obviously, you love Star Wars if you bought this collection. I certainly do. But I love the collection more than anything because of the extras. You can't beat seeing Mark Hamill's screen test, George's 70's hair, and the documentary on the evolution of Darth Vader for Episode III. Not to mention the nerdy pleasure I get out of watching the films with subtitles so I can see how names and places are REALLY spelled and see how they translate R2's beeps and whistles. I LOVE IT!! If you don't own this, go out and buy it today!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I feel rather silly jumping on the Eno bandwagon decades after his best and most influential works were released. But here I am. Burned out on everything else, uninspired by anything new, I find myself going back to Eno again and again. This cd is really great. Simple, easy to listen to ( but certainly not \\"Muzak\\" )and very relaxing without being boring. Nice to listen to at night before bed, cool in the background when its raining out. And yes, I did actually put this on headphones as I waited for a flight out of Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.
B000006ZL4|5.0|This is a record very dear to my ears and soul because at the time of it's realease it forever opened up the boundaries and horizons of metal for me, made me realize that beauty is possible within the metal confines.Nostalgia you say? Nah! Nostalgia is the act of recalling the past in a romantic way (and therefore changing the real events).This cd i listened to it today and it still blows out of the water pretty much everything else, metal or other styles as well. <br />For the most part this is neoclassical metal, as patented by Yngwie but it's leaps ahead the work of that guy who choose to repeat himself in every album and song.This music has much more variety, progressiveness, complex stuff (by each and every member, unlike Ynwie stuff) and beauty that the aforemented guitarrist only maybe DREAM of doing himself! <br />I really can't imagine someone not liking this cd.And if so, the world is terrible wrong, man. <br />Buy it to have a proper collection of music. <br /> <br />
B00006JU7T|5.0|Mention 1970's cinema and SERPICO is one of the first 5 films that comes to mind.  This was the first Pacino tour de force in a film that has staying power through today.  Sidney Lumet created a materwork without equal.I always said that had it been released a year later it would have garnered more than the 2 Oscar nominations it did (Pacino as Best Actor and Best Screenplay-Adapted, for Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler).  The film is true to the best seller by Peter Maas and accurately follows the actual record of events (The Whitman Knapp Crime Commission, Serpico's tours of duty with the NYPD)without adding any fluff.  The secondary performances are outstanding, with John Randolph spectacular as Sidney Green, Tony Roberts rock solid as Bob Blair and the drop dead gorgeous Cornelia Sharpe (where is she these days).  I still have my copy of the soundtrack on vinyl.

B00062J00S|4.0|I've read a lot of reviews about this movie wherin the reviewer complains that this movie is too sappy, or sexist, or whatever.  Bottom line, this movie was made back in 1946, where family was still the center of life, where the father was the head of the household.  Much as many people would like, you can not re-write the past. I think this is a great movie, with an awesome lesson.  No matter how bad you think your life is (no matter if you're a man, woman, or child), someone else's life would be worse were it not for you.
0064407667|4.0|Book 1 of the Series of Unfortunate Events. Read it in about an hour or so. The Baudelaire children find themselves in the care of a very distant (and cruel) relative after their parents' death. This is the beginning of their unfortunate adventures as orphans.<br /><br />I was expecting something a lot different when I started reading this book. I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't what I expected it to be. I found it a little jarring how the omnipresent narrator would suddenly start defining words in the middle of sentence, but I can see how that would be important for children who have no interest in dictionaries.<br /><br />The book was absorbing. The plot was a little thin, but I had to see what happened to the children. Yes, it is slightly despressing for a children's novel--morose, even--but it's an interesting read. I couldn't help hoping that something good happened to those children, but as we all know, this isn't the case.<br /><br />I don't agree with the reviewer who mentioned these books had some undertones not suitable for children, so did the Harry Potter books, especially the latter books. And these books are nowhere near as \\"thematic\\" as the 2nd Harry Potter book.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|\\"Van Helsing\\" was visually exciting and thrilling, and a great movie to watch. Just don't actually try to \\"think\\" about it. <br /> <br />Don't think about a secret religious organization that employs monks and mullahs together in the Vatican's basement. Ignore nonsense like fully automatic crossbows that operate on the same priniciple as an AK-47. Oh, don't worry, every rural village church as holy water on tap. Of course it's possible to keep a syringe in a bottle of acid and not damage it. And I learned that vampires copulate with each other and must be ovoviviparous! <br /> <br />Yeah, Hugh Jackman really looks cool, Kate Beckinsale looks hot, and the special effects were fancy, but the plot was silly as could be. It just seemed like they wanted to gobble up every bit of gothic literature at once and flash it up. Best stick with the real classics over this one.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|The movie is great if you're a fan of the game, which quite frankly, i don't know a playstation fan who isn't. Angelina Jolie fits Lara Croft so well, and the Simon West and Angelina made the write choice on Angelina doing most of her stunts, because if they had a stunt double for every stunt, Angelina wouldn't be in the movie 85 percent of the time, the plot is good but not great, like most video game or comic movies, the plot is not the case, it's the action and the potrayal of the characters. The movie itself is good, a definite must see for Video Game fans.
0156027321|4.0|I am mystified by the idea that this book would make anyone believe in God.  It is about a 16 year old boy who is an adherent to three different religions and who relates a story about surviving at sea through a very extensive knowledge of animal behavior and natural history.  It is about a boy who is named after a public swimming pool in France who grows up loving to swim and then is castaway on a lifeboat on an ocean where it is too dangerous to swim.  Symbolizing ... ?  And in the end you will end up wondering if Yann Martel is trying to tell us that science and religion are both simply products of the human mind invented to help us survive in a dangerous and desperate world.

B00005NGZX|5.0|... the experience of being inside an F4 tornado full of broken glass shards. Uplifted, pummelled senseless, disoriented, and shredded to pieces all at the same time. Moments of blissful calm when the eye hovers overhead, but such times are brief, and ended abruptly by the sheer unrelenting storm of sharp flying objects and breakneck winds.<br /><br />THAT, my friends, is the natural equivalent of Converge's Jane Doe.<br /><br />Converge hasn't put out a single bad album since their early '90s inception. Petitioning The Empty Sky, their debut, pretty much wrote the book on American metalcore. When Forever Comes Crashing, the previous album, and the most recent You Fail Me--both excellent, boundary-pushing works. Even the odds-and-sods release Unloved And Weeded Out would put the likes of Poison The Well and Killswitch Engage to shame.<br /><br />But Jane Doe is hands-down their best album ever. Chaotic yet beautiful, it's a unified statement of music's extreme edges with lyrics that suggest a vague central concept (maybe something to do with the woman presented in Jacob Bannon's excellent art). Emotional yet not \\"emo\\"; metalcore absent any of the fourth-rate Gothenburg imitations, repetitive breakdowns, and generic Hot Topic angst; technical without being overtly mathy. Bannon's feral shrieks rarely ever let up, and are more an additional instrument than anything else. The drumming is fast, intricate, and flawless. The production has a rough, dirty quality that adds a serious raw urgency to the band's assault yet without sounding amateurish (black metal this ain't).<br /><br />But that's not to say there's a lack of subtlety here. Hell To Pay has a cool bass groove that reminds me of Slint; Phoenix In Flight features Bannon's voice at its most ethereal, almost shoegazer-like (don't get used to it; the calm is suddenly obliterated by the vicious sub-minute grind of Phoenix In Flames); and the title track is a 12-minute towering monument that stands as one of the Top 20 Greatest Metal Songs Of All Time (it's way up there, at any rate). 8 minutes of pounding rhythms and snarling vox with brief moments of clean singing, followed by Bannon's haunting final scream; the last 4 minutes or so build up into a crescendo that is sheer carthartic power. What a way to end it.<br /><br />Converge's career-defining album.

No vocal, hit no high note, nothing impressive with her voice whatsoever. It gets pretty annoying. For those of you that are looking for a singer with talent, don't buy this cd. If your looking for a cd to dance to, buy this cd.

And here, Bruce Lee modernizes the art so that it can be applied to real-life situations on the street. Excellent book that is definitely worth purchasing!
0671799320|5.0|Daniel Yergin has done an amazing job with The Prize.  It is meticulously detailed and highly entertaining and enlightening. <br /> <br />Before reading this book, I was under the typical California liberal impression of the oil industry: that we went into foreign countries, took the oil rights and screwed everyone out of everything for the almighty dollar.  What I learned surprised me: everything oil companies did was through painstakingly negotiated contracts with the government, which was supposed to last for decades but, due to foreign greed, forced new contracts with steeper terms every couple of years.  In fact, most if not all of the oil would have remained rotting in the ground without these companies going in and developing them, for not only their profit but for the third world country's as well. <br /> <br />I want to add that while Mexico and Iran fully nationalized their industries despite clear legal obligations to the contrary, pretty much every other country refused to honor their commitments.  It makes me glad to live in America, where contracts are enforcable and people, more often than not, mean what they say.
0060934719|5.0|First, let me say that this story is beautifully written and can probably be enjoyed fully with one's imagination to serve as illustrator.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this book was originally published by DC Comics as a picture book and absolutely stunning illustration was provided by Charles Vess.  Vess has a long and prolific history of illustrating many of Gaiman's comix.  It is a REAL SHAME not to purchase a copy with those illustrations.  BE CAREFUL -- this website doesn't do such a terrific job of making clear which edition is which.  The original is on this site in the edition published by DC Comics with the full title \\"STARDUST:  Being a Romance Within the Realms of Faerie.\\"  It's hard to tell for sure if any other editions here have the Vess illustrations.  The trade paperback edition definitely has NO ILLUSTRATION AT ALL.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|There, I said it - Scarface is the best movie ever made.  I realize I'm jumping on the bandwagon with all the wanna-be thugs, Snoop Dogs, and college kids who want to be trendy, but nonetheless, this is as good as it gets.    This movie could not have been made today.  A major motion picture company would not have gone anywhere near it due to it being anti-social, strongly capitalistic and spitting in the face of political correctness - in other words, a big risk - when studios are desperately trying to limit risk (about every other movie coming out in theaters is a sequel or standard remake).  Aside from studio meekness, the package of director, script, and actors that appear here are very unique and would be quite difficult to duplicate.  Despite a steller effort all around, I would give the most credit to Pacino for bringing the unique character of Tony Montana to life like no one else could, and to Oliver Stone, who envisioned him and the story.    I'd like to talk a little about Tony Montana.  A lot of people consider him a \\"bad guy\\" without morality, but that's missing the point: Tony has morality, it's just different than yours and mine, and he subscribes to it until the end without compromise.  He tries to become successful in a foreign society hostile to him in the only way he can.  He stays true to his word throughout the movie and refuses to kill the innocent.  He tries (albeit unsuccessfully) to keep his kid sister out of his life.  His harmartia (tragic flaw) is that he thinks, on his way up, that money and fame will bring him happiness.  When he eventually finds out it doesn't, his drug use turns excessive and it destroys him.      While I'm at it, I want to add that Tony Montana is a complex and nuanced character, more so than Michael Corleone in the Godfather (whose entire character is summed up as: wants to be legit, can't be legit, wants to look after family, wants to attain power).
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the very best music I have ever heard.  The talent on the stage is unbelievable, the sound is incredible.  All of the songs played in this concert are played better than they ever have been before.  All of them actually sound better than in their studio recording version.  It is also a very fitting and very much earned tribute the my favorite Beatle.  It is worth the $20.00 and much more; having listened to it, I would have paid double that amount!  BUY THIS DVD, OR AT LEAST THE SOUNDTRACK, YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT!!!
B000003TBP|5.0|The is my favorite album ever. Coming from me that means a lot. I have boughten this alubm 3 time now after I've had copies that either got broken or stolen, and each time it makes me so happy to have it again.
B0003V16XQ|5.0|HTDAAB is up there with their best hits of the 80's. For everyone who has been waiting for them to return, they are back. There isn't a track on this album that I don't like. They have definitely earned the right as the biggest rock band in the world with this album. It is heart felt and thoughtful. You know alot of work and thought went into this album, but I don't expect anything less from U2
B0002XDODU|1.0|This album doesn't resemble Rammstein at all.  Where is the powerful guitar riffs I remember from previous efforts.  There are way too many ballads on this album.  Rammstein has sacrificed its musical integrity for a few potential hits.  I mean this album is beyond bad.  I would rate it 0 but Amazon doesn't go that low.  Anyone who gives this album a good rating clearly hasn't heard their old stuff.  I refuse to purchase the next album by this sell out group.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Don't get me wrong I have nothing against the girl herself. Even though she's a [...], I understand that all child stars go down that rocky path. I saw it coming a mile off. Don't get me wrong Britney is mega-hot. Now that she is finally dressing and acting like a [...] I'm happy. Hopefully she'll be able to pursue a successful career as a pole dancer, her true calling. Looking at her hits id say the only song I like is I'm a slave for you. Oh yeah and the song my prerogative is a direct rip off of backstreets back by the backstreet boys. I'm serious, play them together and you will see!!! The music and background vocal (everybody) is the same. Plus the video has her messing around with a French maid. What the!!! Geez Britney you've got you male viewers okay!!! You've snogged that old hag Madonna for extra scandal so stop this entire girl on girl behaviour its old school. Anyway here's Britneys' career in a [...]. Britneys' appears with normal chest size and cute brown her and does a cover of hit me baby one more time (originally sung by a man, strumming a guitar). Loads of pre-pubescent girls dig her but that's cool...Until she stars on the front cover of rolling stones [....]. Right so then she gets a [...] puts on an even baby-er voice and dresses like a [...]. Which enrages billions of mothers across the country since all the little girls want to be like Britney in every way. However Britney still claims she's a Christian and a virgin, furthering the delight of her male fans as she poses in hot pants. This gets up everyone's noses [...]. Anyway Justin breaks up with her [...] and she goes off the rails cus she never really grew up and has the coping factor of a 10 year old. Anyway Justin makes it mega by penning a cruel song about their break up called cry me a river which ironically went straight to number one and stole all Britneys' female fans away from her. [...] So Justin made Britney go onto to women, I'm sure her Christian friends applauded her new direction. But nahh she's not really a lez it's just another desperate stunt to get her publicity and keep her male fan base (which by now probably consists of absolute sickos) happy. And here we are, she composes a song about suicide. She really wants to be loved you see. But until she shows us her genuine self that's imposable. And now it's all over. Good-bye Britney. I hope the future is good to you.
B00063MBU8|5.0|i LOVE the new album ''Still nOt geTTing Any'' it`s awsum! if only they knew just how good they were..which they prolly do =P ah can`t wait til they come to australia to perform it..tiz gunna be the best nite! although, i feel that 'perfect world' relates to me somehow and 'thank-you' is a perfect song for my friend..hehe. i think it`s realli good how simple plan have gone from full rock to like pop. this album is really different from 'no pads, no helmets...just balls' which is good cuz if they kept with like all the same music it would be pretty boring =) if u`z havent already, get the simple plan dvd 'big package for you' cuz its funny and its really kool. i know im going from one review to another, but i think that in the dvd, the interviews are one of the best parts because they are really honest about their lives and how no one can hate them enuff to stop them from doing their jobs...being the best ever punk rockers in the world!!!!!..which they are ! um yeh so..only 93 daii`z til i get to see `em =] YAY !!! luv darCee xOx
B00006RAKP|5.0|I really love this cd set.  Many people say that this greatest hits cd doesn't show the full range of his career, but with such a long one, 34 songs could never cover everything.  I am very satisfied with this cd because it does show Elton's most successful songs since 1970.(hints the name \\"Greatest Hits\\") I would strongly urge anyone who is even a casual fan of Elton John's to buy this CD.  I especially love the 1st CD, which includes his songs from 1970-1977.  His music, to me, was at it's best during these years, and I would have paid the same price just to have the 1st CD.  The 2nd CD is just as good as the 1st.  One thing that I really like about this CD is that you can hear how his music changes over the years from the 1st to last song.  I think that this is a good CD for casual and diehard fans because it does a pretty good job of summing up his career.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I first heard Interpol almost two years ago at a concert in L.A.  The concert was an 80's celebration that included The Cure, Duran Duran, Echo and the Bunnymen, Violent Femmes, Psychedelic Furs, along with many other classic alternative bands.  A few new bands had sets in between the bigger well known acts.  One of those was Hot Hot Heat, who I entirely hated.  As my friend and I were talking about how we really didn't like this wave of new bands being pushed, we heard something interesting coming from the stage.  That was the sound of Interpol.  The irony was wonderful. <br /> <br />My friend and I both stopped talking, and really got into the music.  The next day I ordered the album.  I'm sorry to do this again because I know this comparison has been made to death, but honestly, the first thought I had when I heard this band was \\"Wow, that guy sounds like Ian Curtis\\" (of Joy Division).  I guess this bothers some so-called JD purists, but I really enjoyed it.  Ian Curtis hung himself over 25 years ago!  So I, for one, am happy to have another vocalist around with such a characteristic voice.  At least he doesn't sound like those whiney guys from The Strokes, Jet, or The Hives! <br /> <br />When this CD arrived in the mail, I was very pleased.  The voice is where the comparison to Joy Division stops.  The music has it's own character, and the delivery and content of the lyrics have a totally different message.  These guys write very thick songs, with a lot going on.  On the surface a few people have complained that all of Interpol's songs sound the same.  When the volume in turned up and the listener pays attention, they can really hear the complexity of the rhythm section, and the great rhythm guitar work. <br /> <br />No, this isn't Radiohead or Sonic Youth, but I don't think they're trying to be.  This is a straight ahead rock band, and they do it very well.  I think, if given the proper space, this band has a lot of room to grow.  I can't wait to see what they'll produce in the future (I still haven't picked up their second album).  I think anyone open minded who enjoys \\"alternative\\" or \\"art rock\\", or whatever you want to call it, should really be able to get into this.  Just because it's popular, don't let that turn you off.  It is really good music.
B000021YQV|4.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i dont up in the same category either. <br /> <br />System of a Down was introduced to me in the form of \\"Toxicity\\" the song on the radio. It was a very interesting blend of metal at a time when i was very disillusioned with metal. the two common blends of metal seem to be either the direct descendents of a grunge era or that terrible type of music called screamo. The basis of both is that it is really heavy and theres no groove involved. This is the same for system of a down. They have a very post 2000 sound. The distortion is very clean cut and the drums are very clear and they follow the guitars. But the band does not limit themselves to that. they mix the rhythmic guitar work with the solos which ultimately leads to the singer. The drums a lot of times play their own time, most transparent in \\"Toxicity\\". Serj is a very well spoken singer. having all the qualities of a great singer. when he sings out it is very heavenly, the band is very politically active so there is a bigger sense of umph behind the singing and lyrics, and his screams really do seem sincere. The political aspect of the songs are reminisent of Rage Against the Machine, very agressive and blatant. The most daunting of which is \\"Deer Dance\\". \\"Pushing little Children with their fully automatics, they like to push the weak around!\\" lyrics like these paints a very clear and angry picture. some bands scream for almost no real reason but serj's lyrics are so outrageous that i would have it no other way. The most obviousely intricate and listenable tracks are \\"Chop Suey\\" and \\"Toxicity\\". but after you get used to what the band is all about \\"Forest\\", \\"X\\", \\"Science\\" all fall into place. slowly the mind seeps into the intricacies of the guitar work. There is still some songs for me which i like but still are too obnoxious for me such as \\"Bounce\\", and \\"Jet Pilot\\". sometimes they get a bit too crazy. <br />
B00000255F|5.0|I first heard of Bruce growing up<br /><br />in the 1980s with \\"Born in the USA\\"<br /><br />And I thought, yeah, pretty loud,<br /><br />aggressive, pretty cool<br /><br />But I did not know that this man<br /><br />was even more powerful with previous<br /><br />albums.<br /><br />For new fans like me, these albums<br /><br />blew me away:<br /><br />Bruce Springsteen:<br /><br />1/ Born to Run<br /><br />2/ River<br /><br />3/ Darkness on Edge of Town<br /><br />Want more?<br /><br />Check out: John Cafferty and the<br /><br />Beaver.

B00006L3S3|5.0|The conventional wisdom on Lennon's post-Beatles output is as follows:  He releases a Rolling Stone 5 star album, Plastic Ono Band, in which he puts it all on his emotional sleeve, writing a brutal, spare, and very personal masterpiece.  The albums which follow all, at times, have moments matching the brilliance of his first album, but are marred by increasingly glossy production and weak songwriting.  By the time of his final album of originals he has literally hid behind \\"Walls and Bridges,\\" buried behind cute studio gimmicks, alcohol, guest stars, and lackluster songwriting.  He then cuts a record of oldies, releases a greatest-hits package, and retreats for five years before making a triumphant \\"comeback.\\"<br /><br />What poppycock.  Mind Games is his strongest album, his most focused, thematically-cohesive collection.  It's certainly the one that sounds the most like latter-era Beatles.  The songs usually pointed to as \\"filler\\" actually are among his best material:  The fiesty rocker \\"Tight As,\\" the anthemic \\"I Know (I Know),\\" the lush \\"You are Here.\\"  My personal favorite is \\"Aisumasan (I'm Sorry),\\" a beautiful paean to redemption, faith, and trust in the context of a mature and deeply spiritual relationship.  It's a song he could not have written ten years earlier.<br /><br />The album really benefits from the remastering job done here.  The vocals soar, the harmonies sound great, and John's backing band really cut loose.  I particularly like the harmonic Paul-like bass running through the album, as well as Jim Keltner's steady drumming and Dave Spinozza's crack guitar.  Rock on, John.
0062502182|5.0|This book was nothing short of magical.  I started highlighting parts that spoke to me personally and I realized I would have highlighted almost the entire book if I kept it up, so I chose to highlight only the MOST significant parts to me.... (I ended up underlining a bunch of passages, starring some others, writing in the front pages where more than 25 highly acclaimed sources from across the globe sing their praises for this timeless novel.<br /><br />The story of \\"The Alchemist\\" focuses on a boy we first meet as a Shepherd named Santiago.

B000099T2L|1.0|i can't believe this album got 5 grammys!,she had good choices for singles but this album is so generic.its no different from what ashanti,or aaliyah would have done.i tried to keep a open mind about this album because i don't wan't to becaome a up tight music critic.but theres nothing special about it.....none what so ever.i think shes fine as hell,but i don't think shes fine enough for me to give this album 5 stars.
0790729652|4.0|Sure, Jack Nicholson did a great job as The Joker, but do you know who would have been better in the part? Charles Nelson Reilly. That would have been AWESOME!<br /><br />I still wonder why they cast Nicholson instead of Reilly. Maybe Reilly was asking for too much money.
B000002UAO|5.0|It's hard to say which Beatles album is truly \\"best,\\" but 'Rubber Soul' has the edge. Most of the songs on this album are acoustic love songs, like \\"Michelle,\\" \\"Girl,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood.\\" While all these Lennon/McCartney songs have similar basic instrumentation, the Beatles vary their approach slightly with each one, bringing in additional instruments and subtracting others. Although this isn't a 'concept album' the general threads running through these 14 songs qualify it as a song cycle. Beautiful harmonies, tasteful guitar work, and lyrics clever enough (yet general enough) for you to identify with the songs completely. \\"In My Life\\" is possibly John Lennon's most beautiful set of lyrics. <br /> <br />There isn't a lot of straight-ahead rock on this CD; most of this is really acoustic pop or folk rock. This softer approach is often overlooked by people dazzled by the psychedelic marvels of 'Sgt Pepper' or the pulsating rock of 'With the Beatles.' I find that this is the single Beatles album I return to time and time again, and it seems more enriching each time.
B00007E8V4|5.0|When System of a Down first began, most of us were blown away. Some stuck by them to this very day and appreciated every one of their songs, some more than others. Although the first two SOAD albums were awesome, this is quite better in my opinion. It is lyrically and musically talented and beautiful. Daron and Serj show of their great voices. John shows he can drum, yet again. Shavo also shows that he is a great addition to the band. <br /> <br /> I have read that these songs were all recorded during the Toxicity sessions except for 36 and Mr. Jack, which was supposedly made during the first album and rerecorded, as were all of the songs. It is too bad that Cherry, Forever, and the other songs that didn't make it to this album weren't on here. <br /> <br /> A few people dislike SOAD and their style. They put System down. I have a word to say to all of you. Although, it may not be as bad as you thought it would be, but anyway, YOU SUCK!!! SOAD RULE!!! HA HA HA!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will yet again write a small, crappy (not tended to be) review of each song on Steal This Album! <br /> <br /> 1. CHIC 'N' STEW - (9/10) - A great opener to the album. Odd lyrics, and great guitar riffs. It took me a while to like compared to the others. <br /> 2. INNERVISION - (10/10) - This was one of my favorite songs when it was leaked online prior to STA. It became even better as they added more singing by Daron to it. The first version I heard just said \\"innervision\\" over and over again near the end and every time I listen to that version I miss the beauty of the newer one. Great song, anyway. Good lyrics. <br /> 3. BUBBLES - (9/10) - As I listened to this for the first time, I just put it on repeat because it was a little too short. Bubbles is a great song in pretty much every way, except for the part that is is only 1:57 long. Or shall I say, short. It was previously named \\"Chupa Cabra\\" before the release of STA. <br /> 4. BOOM! - (9/10) - It would be much better if Serj turned his talking affect into a more singing style. The music video slightly sucks due to all of the people talking and stuff. It is funny, though. <br /> 5. NUGUNS - (8/10) - I would call this a rip off of the earlier \\"Defied You\\", but it is almost completely different. Serj and Daron actually sing more in Nuguns, while in DY they do more of screaming. Different lyrics, too. Great song, however. <br /> 6. A.D.D. - (8/10) - Good song, good lyrics, slightly just above average. (American Dream Denial) <br /> 7. MR. JACK - (9/10) - Earlier called P.I.G., standing for who-knows-what...whatever... Great song, slightly funny lyrics, great intro to the song. <br /> 8. I-E-A-I-A-O - (10/10) - One of the best songs on STA. A bit of odd lyrics sung quickly, except for the \\"i e a i a o\\" part... <br /> 9. 36 - (8/10) - 36 was made during the first days of SOAD under a different name. Extremely short. It would totally be better if it was longer. It is a good song, still. <br /> 10. PICTURES - (9/10) - Great song in almost every aspect. A bit odd in parts, though. <br /> 11. HIGHWAY SONG - (10/10) - One my favorite SOAD songs. Has great lyrics and many parts of it are very beautiful. Gets stuck in my head and I start to scream the lyrics to people who I have never seen and probably never see again. Oh, well... You know? <br /> 12. F**K THE SYSTEM - (10/10) - Great, confusing song. Funny and hard to comprehend. FTS also gets stuck in my head and I scream this song at people, too. <br /> 13. EGO BRAIN - (10/10) - Beautiful song in every aspect. I love it. Beautiful vocals, lyrics, and guitar work.  <br /> 14. THETAWAVES - (8/10) - Good song, good lyrics. Meh. Not too interesting, but worth a couple of lisens and no skipping. <br /> 15. ROULETTE - (10/10) - Another beautiful song in lyrics and vocals and guitar works. <br /> 16. STREAMLINE - (10/10) - Yet another beautiful song. This version is even better than the version on the Scorpion King soundtrack. It has more singing effort byDaron. It has great lyrics, and great guitar action also. <br /> <br /> SONGS THAT I KNOW OF THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT ON STEAL THIS ALBUM! <br /> These songs are a couple of songs that I know of that I have actually heard that were recorded during Toxicity but did not make it on STA or Toxicity. That truly sucks. They are a couple of SOAD's best songs. <br /> <br /> FOREVER - (10/10) - This song should have seriously been on STA. It is a great song. It has great lyrics. Great everything. I LOVE IT!!! GHAAAA!!!! <br /> CHERRY - (9/10) - Cherry is an odd song with weird lyrics. It is a really cool song with cool guitar riffs or whatever. It is a little short, though. Cherry is my sister's favorite SOAD song. <br /> DEFIED YOU - (9/10) - Begins pretty much like Nuguns, but it is a lot different in the fact that it has no true singing parts in it, but mostly screaming. Good song. It is better than Nuguns I think. It should've been on STA also. <br /> <br /> I am sorry if this didn't help you. I can't write reviews worth crap. Anyway, you should really check out all of SOAD's albums. Even the two that come out in 2005, Hypnotize and Mesmerize. There are many great SOAD songs that are not on albums. So if you have any friends with those songs... then mooch off of them and copy the CD and send me a copy. Ta ta. <br />
B000667FN8|4.0|Upon Hearing \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Untitled\\", i was so blown away by the sound. These are the only two slow songs, but they are so deep and soo beautiful that i had to keep them on repeat several times before really absorbing what Simple Plan had to offer. The fast songs are okay, I do not really like \\"Jump\\" or \\"Me Against the World\\" or \\"Shut up\\" but, these two slow songs, are worth the entire cd. If you don't believe, just take a listen. They are worth crying to.  <br /> <br /> <br />...I open my eyes, i try to see but i'm blind by the white light, can't remember how, can't remember why I'm lying here tonight... <br />And i can't stand the pain, and i can't make it go away, no i can't stand the pain... <br />How could this happen to me, I made my mistakes, got nowhere to run, the night goes on, as im fading away, im sick of this life, i just wanna scream,  <br />\\"how could this happen to me.\\" <br />Everybody's screaming, i try to make a sound but no one hears me, slipping through the edge, im hanging by a thread, i wanna start this over again, <br />So i try to hold onto a time where nothing matters, and i can't explain what happened, <br />And i can't, erase the things that i done..... <br />no i can't... <br /> <br />

1563890410|5.0|\\"The Sandman: Season of Mists\\" is the fourth volume of ten. In this epic, Dream travels to Hell in a quest to free a woman named Nada that he condeemed to Hell over ten thousand years ago. He goes on this quest, because he took the advice and encouragement of his eldest sister, Death. When Dream arrives to Hell he finds that there is no one there and that Lucifer no longer wants the burden of ruling Hell weighing down upon him, so he gives the key to his domain to Dream. Initially, Dream is honored, but he soon realizes that the power of this key is corrupting him. In his kingdom of the Dreaming, Dream sits and ponders what he should do with this key. At this time, Dream is visited by a horde of characters from mythological realms to the Silver City to the very depths of Hell itself. Dream's decision in this story is incredibly important not only to the people who have traveled for the key, but to the universe that surrounds them.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is probably right up there with \\"The Doll's House,\\" which still, in my opinion, is a masterpiece. \\"Season of Mists\\" should be in every comic book readers collection along with all the other \\"Sandman\\" books.

Can you say literary Viagra? <br /> <br />Best of all the story is open-ended so we can hope for a sequel, or better yet a series!
B000000HZT|4.0|I know... I'll get zero \\"was this review helpful\\" votes, because this review will be too negative.  When I rate 5 stars, everybody LOVES my review... I give 2 or 3 stars and NOBODY finds it helpful.  So it goes... you'd think they'd be appreciative I was trying to save them money.  :) <br /> <br />AWESOME music on this CD.  Definite 5 stars for the music and keyboard work. I picked this up used in a pawn shop back in '92 for $4.  Being an early Genesis fan, I liked Banks' keyboard work, but really didn't know beans about the CD.  Worse yet, they were selling it in an \\"Invisible Touch\\" CD case, so I had nothing to read (track listing, liner notes, etc) about it either.  <br /> <br />Was pleasantly surprised by the CD, being a blind purchase, and I thought (and still think) the textured keyboards and melodies were sweet.  Of course, the ONLY thing I didn't like about it was the vocalist (and still don't... guess I need a new brain as well).  He seems to be a \\"red state/blue state\\" issue... you either love him or hate him.  The only thing I can say is A LOT of prog bands seem to pick technically proficient vocalists (Spock's Beard, Flower Kings, most Rick Wakeman solo projects, GTR--yeah I know, not really prog, but boy did that singer \\"Max Whathisface\\" stink) who have very little soul or \\"feeling\\" when they perform (unless you consider the performances in \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" deeply moving... then you might find these vocals stirring as well...just kidding...they're not quite that bad...).  There's just no emotional connection with the vocal delivery as if the guy is just reading someone else's lyrics (which he is).  He just didn't \\"make the lyrics his own\\" so to say. <br /> <br />And I would have to agree with the reviewer who called this \\"Duke's Little Brother\\".  Before I ever saw the release date, I guessed this had to be someplace between \\"Then There Were Three\\" and \\"Duke\\" (you know, those two post-Wind&Wuthering albums that were lambasted by a reviewer who thought this CD is a masterpiece...\\"ironic\\" I thought, \\"since they sound a lot alike to me\\").  Arrangements and melodies are way similar. Like those other two CDs, there's a nice blending of synth pads, leads, etc with the more dynamic piano textures.  Like a lot of Genesis CDs, Banks also has a few \\"droning bass pedal\\" tunes on here (nice chords shaped around a steady bass note) similar to \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Snowbound\\", or \\"Squonk\\".  As most the reviewers seem to indicate, this really is the most Genesis-like solo Banks (at least that I've heard). <br /> <br />So, to summarize, this is a very nice album musically, and if you liked \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" or \\"City of Angels\\" (w/Cage) then you'll probably like the vocal performance on this as well.
B0000549B0|5.0|Harvey is one of those rare films that contains side-splitting laughter as well as valuable content to enrich one's life.  Harvey also provides much food for thought on the topic of insanity.<br /><br />The story is about young, earnest Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) and his \\"friend,\\" a six-foot tall, invisible white rabbit named Harvey.  Much to the consternation of his sisters, everyone avoids the family because of Dowd's oddball character.  True, Dowd spends much time at the bar, and there is a hint of tragedy in his past.  But is that the reason for Harvey's . . . existence?<br /><br />When Dowd's younger sister Myrtle Mae's society debut party is interrupted by Elwood introducing Harvey to the wealthy matrons in the parlor, that is the last straw for Elwood's older sister Vera.  She decides to have Elwood committed to a mental institution, and promptly pays a visit to Chumley's Rest Home, where she pours out her story to the young attending physician.  Much hilarity and misunderstanding ensues.<br /><br />The black and white filmography only adds to the charm of this unique story.  The supporting cast is tremendous.  The lady who plays Vera reprises the role she played in the stage production of Harvey.  Harvey is my number one favorite movie of all time.<br /><br />James Stewart comments in the extras that people would come up to him all the time and inquire as to how Harvey was.  At first he thought they were joking.  Then he realized the folks were quite serious.  So, he told them Harvey was doing wonderfully.
0446677450|5.0|I'm not giving this book five stars because it has helped me become a millionaire, or even because its prose is so rich it has moved me to tears...<br /><br />There's nothing new or profound about this book which makes it different from any other financial book out there on the market. And that's because, the REAL reason why so many people all over the world (Yours truly, included) have purchased it, is the fact that at some level most of us can see ourselves as that young boy, Kiyosaki once was, trying not to grow up like his father who died poor and in debt.<br /><br />There's something almost \\"Star Wars-like\\" about the whole thing. But maybe in reverse! His \\"Rich dad\\" wasn't really his Father at all - no matter how badly Kiyosaki must have wanted it!<br /><br />This ISN'T a good book on finance. I wouldn't give it even a single star in that department. But this is a GREAT (albeit poorly written and repeatitive) book on the human condition, and how to face and overcome the fear of \\"not having enough\\" to survive.<br /><br />I never understood why this book has both been praised and condemned - vehemently - by opposite camps, until now. The truth is that much of this confusion is brought about by Kiyosaki himself by trying to create a whole line of other products (games included) touted with the promise of making you a millionaire!<br /><br />This book could have made it as a good novel (if only the characters were more fully fleshed out) but instead it languishes here among far more competent financial books.<br /><br />But I have to give credit where credit is due. I have bought more books of this \\"Rich Dad\\" series and did actually find much that I was looking for. (Try looking for the Rich Dad's \\"Advisors\\" - they live up to the hype most of the time)<br /><br />My five stars are for the drama and the hype generated. And for the fact that it has motivated me to BUY into the Kiyosaki marketing ploy! Any book that can do that, must have something going for it!
B0000035E7|5.0|that indelibly captures an individual's anguish on tape.  If you are new to Nirvana, don't start here, go with Incesticide - it showcases a larger variety of Kurt's talents.  If you are a Nirvana fan, however, you cannot be without this album.  Buy it now.  Don't pay attention to naysayers who criticize lack of musicianship and poor recording quality.  That is NOT what this music is about.  Instead, its strength lies in its raw aggression, emotion, dirty melody and embarrassingly honest poetry.  Put this record on and prepare to be transported into Kurt's psychosis...
B00064ADR0|5.0|I purchased this set mainly for the second disc, The Royal Albert Hall Show.  I tell you, I'd pay the full price for disc two alone, it is that tremendous.   The original album is one of Winter's best, already 35 years old!  It contains a great blend of rock 'n' roll & blues music as well as some of the baddest playing Johnny has ever laid down on vinyl (okay tape). <br />This is by far the best sounding version of these recordings to date. <br />For newcomers, this is a great purchase because you get Johnny in the studio and live.  Don't let the price inhibit you on this purchase. You can't take it ($$$$) with you.  Once you cue up track one you'll consider it money very well spent, I guarantee!
0765309408|5.0|I read an earlier version of Old Man's War when John Scalzi had it up on his Whatever webpage. I was sooo lucky to be able to finish it before John took it down, due to getting the Tor contract. I am a regular reader of John's page. <br /> <br />I love new ideas put in with humour and other goodies. These old geezers are not waiting to die. Instead they get new, young bodies and then go out into the universe & fight battles. Of course, with new, hard bodies, they discover other uses and relationships as well. <br /> <br />This is definately a good book! I can't wait to own my copy soon.
0783230079|5.0|This movie revolves around one question \\"What one thing, if you did it, would've made a difference in your life?\\"<br /><br />It is a good question for all of us to consider in the course of our daily lives.  In this movie, four people die prematurely in a bus accident - OK, four people plus the bus driver whose mind was preoccupied with sex and instead of watching where he was driving, he swerved off the bridge.  All of these four people had some unfinished business, so they remain earthbound.  They find themselves attached to a body of a kid and stick around until he's all grown up.  Not knowing at first what to do, or the reason for them being earthbound, they are attempting to be of help to the kid, but seeing that they are causing him more problems than help, they stop interfering with his life and mind their own business, still wondering why are they stuck.<br /><br />Eventually, it is revealed to them that they were still earthbound so that they could resolve one thing that would've made a difference in their lives.  Now, the challenge begins, because it is not just a matter of doing the thing, but about overcoming inner obstacle, and having guts to follow one's heart.  After all, that is what life is about, that is what every day is about - having the courage to follow one's heart, having the courage to listen to one's soul - and in this movie it is a team-spirit of one individual helping another to do that one thing that would've given meaning to his life, that would have left him enriched and empowered in some way, that would've justified the reason he had the body in the first place.  One may here also developed a new appreciation for one's body and one's life on earth because there are some things that just can't be done without it.<br /><br />The characters and the cast in this movie are utterly delightful and as you watch the movie, it's not only that you may enjoy the movie, but perhaps it helps you to look at your life in a different way and consider what it is that you would like your life to stand for and to just go for it.<br /><br />The movie is not only heartwarming but also full of humorous tidbits and at the end of the movie there's a part with B.B. King playing that sent thrills and shivers of delight throughout my body.sider what it is that you would like your life to stand for and to just go for it. <br /> <br />The movie is not only heartwarming but also full of humorous tidbits and at the end of the movie there's a part with B.B.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Thanks Sigur Ros.  First and foremost, thanks for ripping out my heart and soul and then serving it back to me as a musical masterpiece.  You've created a breathtaking hour of beauty that makes me giddy with joy.  Thanks for completely flooring me with tracks three and four and thanks for the concussion resulting there from.  Also thanks for charging me thousands of dollars for your music.  Sure, it was only fifteen bucks at best buy, but it made my whole CD collection obsolete.  Radiohead no longer has the emotional intensity, Weezer now sounds like a bunch of kids playing with guitars, and Coldplay sounds shallow and poppy in comparison.  Thanks for transforming my case full of good music into a case full of expensive coasters.  Thanks for making indescribable music that makes me sound ridiculous when I attempt to explain its beauty.  How can I tell my friends about some weird Icelandic band and make them understand?  And finally, thanks for leading me to a dead-end.  Where are my musical tastes to lead me now?  How can I ever go back to what I once loved?  How will I ever find anything like this ever again?  In all liklihood, I won't.  And that's what I'm afraid of.  So thanks again, Sigur ros.  Thanks.
B00005KHJR|5.0|One of a kind, engaging masterpiece, which doesn't fall neatly into the horror category.  It does represent a clash between two different worldviews, two belief systems - pagan and Christian with the focus on the lifestyle and practices of a small pagan group living on a small island west of Scotland.<br /><br />The inhabitants are friedly and live their life in harmony with nature and with their own beliefs and practices, according to their own code of morals and ethics.  As much as it may seem bizarre to the outsiders, it is no more bizarre than most other codes - merely different.<br /><br />Among the rituals this group performs, one requires a sacrifice - yet the sacrifice has to come out of his own free will and has to fulfill three conditions:  he has to be a representative of the law, he has to be a virgin and he has to prove to be a fool.<br /><br />The Christian man who is intentionally tricked to come to the island is not left without a choice.  He is free to leave any time he wishes.  He is also given plenty of opportunity and even lead in many ways to prove to be an unsuitable sacrifice - to no avail.  One could say, when in Rome, do as Romans do - or else ... dismal things may happen.
0646418432|4.0|Many have read Murder on the Orient Express and other classic Agatha Christie books.  I probably read my first Christie book 25 years ago. <br /> <br />But I had never heard of her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, before spotting it in a library.  This book is certainly not her best.  But it is certainly worth reading.  Interestingly, despite introducing her famous detective Hercule Poirot to the reader, she treats him as a person who people should know if they know anything about detectives, as someone with whom we are all acquainted already. <br /> <br />The plot has all the hallmarks of Agatha's later works.  A person dies.  There are small assorted clues, but nothing like a smoking gun.  There are people who hate the victim, and people who love them, but Christie manages to draw suspicion upon both sets of characters alike without making the plot seem forced.  The intricate plan for the murder that eventually comes out is similarly within the realm of possibility. <br /> <br />The only real problem I had was that when Poirot revealed the final clue, it was something none of us could have guessed beforehand.  Still, this was a good first effort in a marvelous career for Agatha Christie.
078322740X|5.0|A charming comedy played superbly by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn.<br /><br />Martin plays a decently successful architect and uses his talent to build a house for his high-school sweatheart.  He is rather romantically inclined and presents her with this engagement gift wrapped in a big red ribbon.  This scares away his high-school sweatheart as she interprets it as him being too imaginative and living in the fantasy-land than being a down-to-earth man, she'd prefer to be with.<br /><br />Heartbroken, he ends up in a Hungarian restaurant to wash away his woes and eventually pours out his heart to a waitress, played by Goldie Hawn, who doesn't stop a beat to take advantage of the situation.  She is an adventurous free-spirit, endowed with wild imagination, who believes that life is to be experienced and she'll do whatever it takes to experience the richness of life.<br /><br />After spending one night with the architect, she promptly packs and unbeknonst to him, move into his newly built house.  After all, why leave such a lovely house empty?  She quickly gets acquainted with local people, charges everything to the architect's account and gets to meet even his parents, to him she presents herself as the architect's wife.  As unique as she is - an acquired taste, as her make-believe inlaws would say, she has a very charming personality and everybody delights in her presence.  Whatever the situation, she always has a ready answer, often backed with a wild and outrageous story.<br /><br />When Martin shows up at his newly-built house and finds her there, he is at first stunned, but figures that the only way to get out of it is by incorporating and continuing her make-believe stories and inventing that they are now getting divorced.  Not only her parents get involved, but also the local priest, who acts as a marriage counsellor, attempting to help them rescue the marriage.<br /><br />Steve Martin is not so good at coming with impromptu answers and he usually botches things up, but Goldie Hawn, quite experienced at playing the game, always manages to rescue the situation.  She utterly enjoys playing the game and continues playing her own agenda.  She even manages to get him promoted.<br /><br />All the events draw attention of his high-school sweatheart who develops some new interest in him - though they face themselves once again with their individual preferences as Martin discovers that he much prefers to live in a wild and imaginary world of Goldie Hawn, which has infused him with added spice and zest for life.tches things up, but Goldie Hawn, quite experienced at playing the game, always manages to rescue the situation.

B000022TSH|5.0|In only several minutes of screen time John Huston is one of the best movie villains of all time. \\"I don't blame myself.\\"  He is unforgettable delivering that line. Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and Robert Towne have never done better work than this. Polanski and Towne could have softened the film's final revelation, but when Faye Dunaway forlornly shakes her head \\"no\\" they leave us nowhere to morally hide. Intelligent, complex, beautifull, this is a wonderfull, wonderfull film. It could never be made today, and that's a shame.
B00026W82U|5.0|So what do I think it is?  It would be easy to parrot alot of what is said in other reviews about musical influences and similarities to other bands.  In fact, when first listening to this album, I got a chuckle from how not only did they do well mimicking the style of Simon and Garfunkel on the first track, but they are singing about listening to them. (I own Erlend Oye's solo effort and Versus as well, so I knew what I was getting when I bought this) <br /> <br />I am in my 30's, and I grew up with Simon and Garfunkel to Metallica, Run DMC to LLCoolJ.  From then till now, from them to to Outkast, Presidents of the USA, Fatboy Slim, Beck, Thievery Corporation, Kruder and Dorfmeister to Royksopp and much inbetween grace my CD collection and I appreciate all for their own additions to the musical tapestry available for us to enjoy.   <br /> <br />This album is great for doing my college homework, chilling with some tea and a book, taking a drive in the rain, or other relaxing but enriching activities - those activities that our frenzied pace in America shoves out of our lives.  In a conscious effort to recall those days as a kid when having nothing to do was a regular phenomenon, I use their music as the soundtrack.

This film has a lot more action than GoodFellas and makes it even more interesting to watch. All in all, if you buy GoodFellas, you got to have Casino to go along! <br /> <br />My points: <br />GoodFellas- 95/100           Casino- 100/100
014017821X|5.0|This is a beautiful book of short stories by a brilliant writer.  She rewrites old fairy tales using a modern, feminist spin.  She plays with the idea that gender relations are eat or be eaten struggles for power and that if you are passive, you will die.  Carter explores this idea in terms of the passive fairy tale heroine.  Expect plenty of predators, both male and female.
1592400876|2.0|I'm a bit of a grammar geek, and I found this book dull, repetitive, and not terribly enlightening.  And for American readers, the British-style punctuation is irrelevant at best.  I didn't even bother to finish it.  Number ten in Amazon overall book sales?  Why?
B00008A7QK|5.0|Marc Bolan was never an amazing guitarist. Marc Bolan did have an awkward voice. But in my mind Bolan was the king of writing a 3min pop boogie that made you want to sing, shout and dance the night away. With his 1971 release Bolan perfected whats known as the \\"Bolan Boogie\\" and essentially wrote an album full of them. The opening track \\"Mambo Sun\\" is a fantastic three chord shuffle with an infectious sing a long chorus. \\"Jeepster\\" was the 2nd single released from the album and sounds like a 1950 pop tune amped up through a Les Paul. I dont know if anyone knows what the hell a Jeepster is, but I sure as hell dont care and I sing along with it like its my job. All in all this glam rock at its finest, just pure rock N' roll, nothing epic, nothing difficult, just a fun party record that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br />Strongest Cuts: Mambo Sun, Jeepster, Bang a Gong, Life's a Gas

B000000W5L|4.0|Despite the endless amount of filler and the poor production Exile On Main Street still stands to this day as one of the best rock n roll albums ever. Evidentely it was recorded in and out of drug induced hazes during the summer of 1972 in a basement in France. This album covers every sound that the stones ever produced in their career and maybe thats why its done so well as it has something for everyone. \\"Rocks Off, Rip This Joint, and All Down the Line\\" are the coked up rockers of the LP. \\"Hip Shake, Casino Boogie, Ventalator Blues\\" are slow paced blues numbers. \\"Sweet Virginia, Torn and Frayed, Black Angel and Loving Cup\\" are country songs and I believe is the best part of the record. So all in all, if you are a Stones fan you probably already own this, if you are a newbie to the Stones, I dont advise this LP as a first record to buy, youll be taken back by the poor production and the lack of a strong single. <br /> <br />Strongest Cuts: Sweet Virgina, Torn and Frayed, Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, Happy, Shine a Light

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Just in case it didn't sink in the last time around, Britney thought it best to remind us time and again on her latest disc \\"In the Zone.\\" No longer merely suggestive, this album is not necessarilly for kids. However, like her idol Madonna, Britney realizes if you want more than fifteen minutes of fame, you've got to grow musically. <br /> <br />That isn't to say Britney is changing to try and keep up with the times (if anything, this sounds like something Madonna would have released in '97), but rather that she's saving teen pop for....well, teens. Her new CD is not full of the catchy, radio friendly tunes that made her famous. \\"In the Zone\\" thrives on club music, often with hip-hop beats and in some instances, even a slight techno vibe.  <br /> <br />The opening track \\"Me Against the Music\\" pairs Spears with Madonna. This was one of the album's singles and longtime Madonna fans should eat it up. I personally found that it was one of my least favorites on the CD, but that's not to say that it's bad. The second track \\"I've Got that Boom Boom\\" features the Ying Yang twins (I think that's what they're called?) and they can be kind of obnoxious. Still, the track is quite good and Brit shines in it, so any annoyances can be overlooked. \\"Toxic\\" while not being a call-back to her earlier work, is nearly as catchy as anything she's ever done. Other highlights include \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Touch of My Hand.\\" The song about her lost love Justin What's-his-face \\"Everytime\\" was a single, but it's one of Britney's ballads. Those have never been her strong point, but the song isn't horrible.  <br /> <br />The album has a very good flow, which is true of pretty much all of Britney's CDs. When I first got it, I listened to it three times in a row, so I think that qualifies as a good listen. With this album, Britney has managed to create something different than she'd ever brought us before. And with all the media attention over her not-so-private personal life, her fame doesn't seem to be on a decline. However, she's stated that she intends to take some time off, and with this CD being her lowest selling to date and the fact that she's just put out a Greatest Hits CD (almost never a sign that you can expect much more from an artist), I'm afraid this might well be her last time to shine. Thus, everyone who's considering it should go out and buy it. I know for fans of her ultra catchy earlier material, it might be difficult to deal with how much she's changed. But I can promise that this is a perfectly entertaining record in it's own right.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil has always been one of my favorite comic characters although I've never been a die hard fan (although that seems to be changing). I bought the theatrical cut of Daredevil on DVD a few weeks ago and I was very entertained by it. Good cast and the director knew what he was doing. There were a few minor things that I wasn't crazy about but the director's commentary made it clear that he wasn't crazy about them either. I enjoyed his comments and his passion about this project. It made me want to see the director's cut of the film.   Now I have.   I was just a little worried that maybe it might be a waste of cash but have no fear. I enjoyed it and I'm more than happy that I bought the director's cut since the additional scenes are all entertaining and it's a great alternate version. I liked many of these additions more than scenes included in the theatrical cut. I wont provide any spoilers but the director's cut is definitely the better cut IMHO.
1563890119|4.0|When Neil Gaiman came back to write \\"Endless Nights\\" several years after the Sandman had ended, the Entertainment Weekly blurb on the cover read, \\"The greatest comic book ever returns.\\" <br /> <br />That's not really hyperbole. <br /> <br />As much-maligned (and as justly) as comic books have been for trading on intricate and nonsensical tropes, recycled stories, characters that never mature, and bloody stupid dialogue, \\"The Sandman\\" found ways to take the wayward form and turns it on its ear. Writer Neil Gaiman summons up a vast, literate, and cockeyed theology of prime movers called the Endless who travel freely to Hell, Los Angeles, and (most interestingly) the Dreaming; a sort of mutable landscape of fictions and stories, ruled over by Dream - a stiff, formal deity and one of the most compelling characters in comics. <br /> <br />The stories in this volume range from pulpy horror (\\"24 Hours;\\" \\"The Sleep of the Just\\") to high-level speculative fiction (\\"The Sound of Her Wings,\\" \\"A Hope in Hell\\"). The art is similarly ranged - \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" uses the subtle Mike Drigenberg to evoke loss and nostalgia, but the Sam Keith psychedelia that festoon \\"A Hope in Hell\\" and \\"The Sleep of the Just\\" work just as well in a completely different way. This is the problem with \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" (which should really be called \\"More Than Rubies,\\" given the story's title in serial form) - it is both an apple and an orange. <br /> <br />Still, there's plenty to like here, and if you think that comics are mostly semi-literate pablum aimed at small children and minor intellects, you've probably never read anything like it. The surprisingly unpretentious mix of the Bible, mythology, potboiler horror, and G.K. Chesterton is something almost completely unique, not just in comics, but anywhere. \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is not the best part of the story (that award is variously distributed among \\"The Kindly Ones,\\" \\"Brief Lives,\\" and \\"Season of Mists\\"), but it is certainly intriguing and highly recommended to anyone who wants to read a book that is both vastly entertaining and something of a literary achievement. <br />
B00025ETIW|4.0|i heard about MCR a while ago. i saw the cd at the stores too and it looked like something i'd like. i'm into melancholy anti-romance bands and songs. i did not want to pick this cd up though because i asked some people and they said it was kind of bad. i saw it yesterday for cheap so i thought what the hell. omigod, this cd is pretty damn good. screamo or w/e they want to call themselves, i don't care. the cd is quality. somebody reviewed it saying the dude can't sing, that's what i like about it. it's punk rock, true punk rock vocals with the wailing nailing and screaming. i was listening to AFI's Sing the Sorrow and i really dig \\"Dancing Through Sunday\\" with the wailings and have been trying to find something with a catchy tune but with screams. MCR does that and more, almost every song has a nice wailing screaming vocal, some songs are too soft but overall works. i love how the songs are angry anti-romance. i cannot say that i have heard something like them, closest thing is AFI and it's not even THAT close. pretty good from what i have heard on the cd. maybe i'll grab an older cd too.
B0002XDODU|5.0|For the fourth time Rammstein deliver a masterpiece! And every album has it's own flavour! <br />Reise Reise is an emotional journey through the wicked world of the german sextet. No wonder the album's cover sleeve represents an airplane's black box-two of the songs ( Reise Reise and Dalai Lama) are dedicated to plane crashes. The group has grown as songwriters (there are unexpected twists in some songs, as well as choruses and even a symphony orchestra). Mein Teil is probably the best Rammstein song ever-intense and grotesque at the same time. The guitars are heavily distorted and the music fits ideally with the story for the caninbal- madman. Unfortunately, they have omitted the newspaper announcement included at the beginning of the video. Keine Lust starts heavy and has as surprising twist when the main character realizes he's dying. Los is probably the less interesting song on the album although I appreciate the humour . Amerika is an ironic description of what is happening recently in the United Stattes-very catchy chorus contrasting the heavy guitars. Moskau is an excellent song - slightly ironic , partly nostalgic about the democratic changes in this beautiful city- a girl's voice singing in Russian makes the song very authentic. Stein Um Stein is about a madman who's going to hide a body in the walls of house he's building. Incredible vocals from Till and an amazing synth solo. Ohne Dich is a stunnning ballad about a loss of a loved one. Amour is a great closer-about all the sufferings love can bring and as a conclusion at the end Till sings \\" Please, give me poison\\" . Buy this album! It's worth the ride!
B000002A3T|5.0|I know many of you think not - some of you would say \\"Dark Side of the moon\\" or \\"The Wall\\" or the like. All of those albums ARE great, yes (though not up to par with the likes of King Crimson and Genesis at that same time), but this album has something different. This album, is, without a doubt, my favourite PF album - it has grace, it is realistic, it is powerful. Roger Waters was a great song writer - but he was always very negative. This music isn't one sided - it has a depth to it. <br />      Yes, I am aware that much of this might not even make sense. But I really like this album. When I listen to it, I get a feeling of depth and hope that never came out on any of PF's older albums. I like it. I recommend it.
9654484129|5.0|Simon Singh is really a treasure, a gifted mind who can take the obtuse and complex and illuminate in understandable terms and in an engaging manner.  I loved The Code Book for its translation of the babble of cryptography into easy to understand terms, and the author's ability to set a discipline into its human and historical environment.  Simon is one of the finest scientific 'popularizers' around.
0064400557|5.0|E.B. White introduced fantasy to many young readers.  Wilbur, the main character, was a pig that was not wanted because he was a runt.  Fern took care of Wilbur then sold him to her Unlce Zuckerman who owns a farm.  Wilber met many animals, but finds himself lonely.  Wilbur sat in his barn stall all alone.  He asked the animals if they would like to be his friend.  Only one answered and it was Charlotte the spider.  Wilbur must struggle with the idea that he might be dinner.      <br />       Charlotte had an idea that would save Wilbur's life.  She decided to weave words into her web such as, \\"Some Pig\\" and \\"Radiant\\".  For the first time in Wilbur's life he feels wanted.  Many people came to Zuckerman's farm to see this \\"miracle\\". <br />       Wilbur was characterized as a sweet, loving, pig that wanted friends.  This appealed to many young readers because it would allow them to appreciate the friends they have.  This terrific book showed children the importance of friendship and what it means to be a friend. <br />       This Newbery Honor book contained loneliness, happiness, and some humor that readers would enjoy.
0671027387|4.0|This was a good, book.  I generally agree with the criticisms other reviewers offered:  Each chapter changes scenes, the Batman-style cliffhanger at the end of nearly every chapter, etc.<br /><br />I have a few criticisms with logic.  1) Using ice core samples, the scientists pinpoint the meterorites date to within one year, yet the meterorite was inserted from the bottom up.  How could they precisely position it from the bottom up?  2) The F14 flight of 3000 miles at full afterburners with no mention of midair refueling is hard to swallow.  Then the plane took off again within minutes with no refueling.  Ferry range for one of these planes at perhaps 450 mph is 1500 miles.  I would be surprised if the plane could go even 400 miles at full speed, meaning they would have needed multiple refuelings.  3)  Their are multiple mentions of NASA's failure of the Titan IV rocket with a spy satellite.  To my knowledge, Lockheed Martin lauches the Titan, I don't believe NASA has anything to do with it.<br /><br />As far as writing style, when Rachel was introduced to Dr. Marlinson, I was getting tired of reading \\"Tolland groaned\\".  The last chapter with Tolland going on about how sexy fish are did not seem to fit with his character, or the rest of the book, for that matter.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good read.
0141439475|4.0|I started reading \\"Frankenstein\\" because I needed a book to read for school.  I didn't know much about it except for what's in the various movie versions.  It turned out to be a very dark, depressing, sad story about man with many problems, and a misunderstood outcast.  When you watch the movie \\"Frankenstein\\", the monster that Frankenstein created was made out to be evil.  This is not necessarily true in the book, however.  In the book, you hear more of this outcast's story, as well as more of Frankenstein's story.  In reading the book, you find out that the creature Victor Frankenstein created wasn't at all what the various movies presented him as.  In most of the movies, the creature was presented as this illiterate, bumbling, stupid, ragefull, evil killer, but in truth, he was a kind, gentle, loving, smart creature.  You also learn more about Victor's family, past, schooling, etc.<br /><br />  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was depressing, yet insightful.  It was deep as well as enlightening.  I also like how the book was set up.  It was made up in letters from a man to his sister.  The man was captain of a ship, and he found Frankenstein dying in the ocean.  The man took Victor onto his ship, and Victor told the man his story.  The book is Victor's story, written down by the man in a letter to his sister.  I liked this book because of what I said as well as it giving me a new view on the story, because you see, all I had known of this story before was what was said in the movies.  Now that I have read the book, the movies anger me.  The movies anger me because they take the book out of context.  They turn a wonderful, yet depressing, tale of a man and a creature into a story about a stupid killer of a creature and a crazy doctor.<br /><br />  All in all, this is a fantastic book that I recommend to anyone in high school or older.  It is depressing, in some ways unrealistic, in some ways very realistic, but it's still worth reading.  I gave it four stars.  Definitely a very entertaining and interesting book.it four stars.

0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad has good financial advice (I like \\"FINANCIAL AEROBICS - Get Your Fianances in Shape\\" even better) but the real great advice in this book is about education.<br /><br />Kiyosaki's poor dad went with the failing American education system. Government run, teaching kids to get a job with a big corporation and all will be okay.<br /><br />For many of us, that system has never worked. For others, it's failing us after decades of hoping it will work out.<br /><br />Better we should take responsiblity for our own fiancial education. in the end, we're all like \\"rich dad\\", working for ourselves.
B000062YAZ|5.0|First of all i see people talking down upon slayer i would like to know why? You may listen to maiden, preist, dio, and other really good metal bands but slayer is just reidiculous and this album shows it. Every song on here is out of control and if you think it is repetitive you don't understand anything about music, you probably do not play guitar and should listen to the album again. This and about every other slayer album should get five stars because they've stuck together, never made a bad album and havent betrayed their fans, they've kept it so freakin' real.
B000001FDI|4.0|This is an unusual album, as it is a \\"one off\\" album from this assemblage of performers. It is an interesting period piece, from controversial cover to the interminable drum extravaganza by Ginger Baker, \\"Do What You Like.\\" For me the standouts on the album are easily \\"Can't Find My Way Home,\\" the song that still defines Steve Winwood as a vocalist in a performance that is simultaneously gentle and sensuous, yet powerfully punctuated: truly it stands as one of the great songs of the 1960s. The other gem is the reworked Buddy Holly gem, \\"Well All Right\\" which is a great example of a song being transformed for the better by improved musicianship.<br /><br />The album does have faults, though. First, it is barely enough material to be called an album with all of six songs. If it wasn't for the droning drum soloing in the 15-plus minute \\"Do What You Like,\\" this would have been more suitable to have been released as an EP. In retrospect, I feel that Ginger Baker was maybe not the best choice for the group: the rest of the performers are at the top of their game musically, but Baker seems a bit leaden and heavy handed for most of these songs. Clapton and Winwood are in peak form though, which makes the CD worthwhile in and of itself. I give the CD four stars for originality and musical purity of vision, with the one star deduction due to the infernal drum solo work, especially on \\"Do What you Like.\\"
B0002Y4T92|5.0|All the artists on this DVD are masters at their craft and it is an amazing display of some diverse talents doing what they do best.  The video quality is superb with plenty of shots of the fingerwork as well as the interaction of the various band members.  The sequences of daylight/nightime performances make it obvious that the DVD doesn't show every act in the sequence they actually performed but the intro pieces before each new artist make the transition easier to take and provides some anticipation of what you're about to see.  Everyone looked like they were having fun and the energy is transferred to the viewer perfectly.  I love this DVD.  It's a collection of some of the greatest guitarists of the day.  I loved how Eric would tone down his playing in deference to the featured soloist but would \\"turn-it-up\\" when it came to be his turn.  Awesome!
B000654YS8|5.0|This is a great collection of Dire Straits' videos from the beginning (\\"Sultans of Swing\\"), to the end (\\"Heavy Fuel\\"). There are 13 videos presented here with three live \\"videos\\" taken from the \\"On Every Street\\" tour. The total running time is right at 90 minutes, and much of the material is rare, so it is wonderful to see all these on one DVD.<br /><br />The videos are as follows:<br /><br />\\"Sultans of Swing\\" - This is from the very early days of music video, and it shows. This is basically a staged version of the song. Mark looks so young in this video that it is almost startling.<br /><br />\\"Lady Writer\\" - I found the \\"Puffy Shirt\\" from Seinfeld! Well, maybe not exactly, but you have got to see the shirt that poor Pick Withers has to endure back at the drum kit (it really does look like its \\"Puffy Shirt\\" namesake). Very lame production values from the late 1970s, once again.<br /><br />\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" - This is the first Dire Strait's video that tells the story largely through actors performing the song as a narrative. Some interesting hairstyles are featured.<br /><br />\\"Tunnel of Love\\" - This is a great early video, albeit featuring some very bad early 1980s clothes and hair.<br /><br />\\"Private Investigations\\" - This is the only video that reveals that Mark is actually left handed if you watch for it. This one is well done, and is genuinely creepy, as per the song's subject matter: highly recommended.<br /><br />\\"Twisting by the Pool\\" - From the EP of the same name, it is a comparatively rare track, and is up-tempo fun. It features film shot from the time of \\"Alchemy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love Over Gold\\" - This one is a bit boring, but honestly it may be my bias: this is not one of my favorite Dire Straits' songs.<br /><br />\\"So Far Away\\" - This is a very conventional and captivating video featuring a lot of studio footage from the band.<br /><br />\\"Money For Nothing\\" - This is, of course, one of the most influential videos in history, introducing computer generated characters to videos. It didn't hurt that the song is the biggest hit ever by Dire Straits.<br /><br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\" - This is an impeccably crafted and suitably somber video. It is incredibly well conceptualized and executed, particularly the \\"machine gun to guitar\\" edit introducing Mark's solo. It is the best Dire Straits video, hands down.<br /><br />\\"Walk of Life\\" - Another great concept, this time illustrating the lighthearted side of the band with sports bloopers.<br /><br />\\"Calling Elvis\\" - This is an interesting video of a relatively weak single from the early 1990s. It was very creative to use \\"Thunderbirds\\" marionettes that looked like the band in this one, a very cool concept.<br /><br />\\"Heavy Fuel\\" - A video shot through the eyes of a roadie. It is very amusing and well done, and shows some interesting behind the scenes footage that fans will love.<br /><br />The last three \\"videos\\" are from early 1990s concert footage, and consist of \\"On Every Street,\\" \\"Your Latest Trick,\\" and \\"Local Hero-Wild Theme,\\" which is always a favorite of mine.<br /><br />This is a great package and as a bonus features an audio interview with Mark Knopfler that is very interesting. I highly recommend this DVD to Dire Straits fans, just expect to laugh at the production values of the earliest videos: the band sure came a long way in fifteen years.cing computer generated characters to videos.

0812550706|5.0|Ok now I myself dont really like Science-Fiction books. But this was one of the best things i have ever read! First off the alien race known as the \\"buggers\\" have attacked Earth twice and have destroyed plenty. The military os willing to do anything to win. So they start recuriting children. The story begins with young Ender Wiggen, after knocking out the bully the military finds out and wants him to join. This means leaving his family and his beloved sister. Once he leaves he will not come back for a couple of years. He decides to go, to place where he is beat up, picked on, and discrimated against. But that does not stop him, he works and works until he's the best. This is a truely awesome book. I have all of the other books that follow. You wont be disipointed!
B000002WEW|4.0|I have always liked this album, but I recommend that you buy the newer version with extra tracks and dialogue added. As it is, this is still a great live Elvis performance from 1973. The set is 22 songs long, and also features the traditional \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" introduction and a track of Elvis making introductions of the band. Standouts here are led by the best version of \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" in history: the vocals are powerful, and the band is in top shape, with particular kudos going to the drums and horns. Also strong are \\"Burning Love,\\" \\"Steamroller Blues\\" (even though it's tongue-in-cheek, it's still great), and \\"A Big Hunk O' Love,\\" which Elvis introduces by saying simply \\"Big Hunk,\\" a line that always makes me laugh. On the down side is the simply appalling version of \\"Hound Dog\\" featuring guitar work that is reminiscent of an unpleasant pre-disco funk that does not compliment the song in the least.<br /><br />This is a great CD overall, but I would look out for the newer release with more material for essentially the same price. Elvis fans will love this performance, and overall I give it four stars.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I saw this movie sometime last year for the first time with two of my friends. At first watching it seemed very good, however after viewing only one more time I realized I was wrong. This movie has several plot holes, a horrible poorly executed ending, and very little interesting dialogue. Also, I noticed that some people who say they like the movie like it for its apparent \\"theoretical\\" significance, but don't be fooled. The people I know who have said this are actually just trying to sound smart which is obvious due to the fact that this movie is in no way theoretical. In fact, this film is liked mostly due to it's lame cliche moral having to do with the decisions we as humans make. Despite this, it did have good acting roles and a decent soundtrack.
B000002MU3|3.0|This is an interesting album although I don't think it is particularly consistent in quality. The best song on the CD (for once) was the big hit: \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" is both lyrically and musically strong. Other strengths include \\"Crush With Eyeliner,\\" and the strange glam-grunge blend tribute to Kurt Cobain featuring an odd but fitting musical dyspepsia, \\"Let Me In.\\" I also find \\"Tongue\\" intriguing, although I can't understand all of the lyrics, and the delicate texture of the song seems out of place on this album.<br /><br />This is neither the best nor the worst from R.E.M., but seems perhaps the most controversial due to the inconsistent quality of some of the songs. I think that \\"Monster\\" is certainly worth a listen, but R.E.M. fans will likely not find it to be their favorite, and non-R.E.M. fans will likely not be converted.
B00005JNEI|2.0|As someone who voted for Bush in 2000, but not in 2004, I can certainly appreciate a great many of the criticisms found in this film.  I think more conservatives should take off their ideological blinders so they may see that the conduct of this administration is not as perfect as the Sean Hannitys and Rush Limbaughs of the world would have you believe.  With that, I found the facts presented in this film to be disturbingly rank with bias.  One could easily make a scathing indictment of the Bush administration by presenting all the facts, not just the negative ones.  For example, while it is clear that we have not been \\"greeted as liberators\\" as predicted by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, there are those in Iraq who are eternally grateful for the job our soldiers are doing.  I am just scratching the surface.  Research the facts presented in this film, and you will find that they only tell half of the story.  I gave this film two stars because it did bring to light a few interesting points and I thought the piece on the grieving mother of the fallen soldier was very well done.  I think this film is definitely worth watching, just take what you see with a grain, no, make that a tub of salt.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This is a great movie, but I'm a little disappointed in the DVD. Infinifilm makes the menus extremely hard to navigate. The DVD cover says there are deleted scenes and outtakes, but I can't find them on either disc. Maybe I'm just stupid . . . <br /> <br />And is it just me, or is Will Ferrell's commentary track the dullest thing ever? I thought it would be hilarious and insightful, and it was neither. Very disappointing. 90 minutes of, \\"Oh, and here's the part where the engine fell off the sleigh and now Buddy has to go find it. Now here's the part where Buddy's dad has to put on the Santa coat. The kid did a really good job in this movie.\\" And on and on! I don't need someone to describe for me what is happening on the screen! <br /> <br />Thankfully, I can access the movie just fine, however. And in the end, that's what I bought this DVD for. This movie is one for the ages!

B000002LND|5.0|I have been a fan of Maggie's or should I say Edith's(Hr Kaballa name) music for a while, but only recently got into her old stuff.

Its called \\"Dear Madonna WIll You Mary Me Love Billy Wilson.\\"  It allt akesplace int he 80's and we get to wear old clothes and stuff.  While working on it we listened to a lot of Madonna, event hough we cant use her songs int he play because its too expensive!!!!!!!

B00004XOWM|1.0|i would have given this a negative but that isnt possible. i used to be like you kids, used to think im depressed cuz i had to do chores and i turned to a bunch of non talented kids with their pants pulled down under their asses and 100 dollar shoes sayin im hardcore ive been through some tough $hit wile hes driven around in a 60,000 dollar car, hmm that is hardly hardcore. ive grown out of this funk and now i listen to black sabbath, megadeth, OLD metallica and such now that is metal. most kids are growing up in a mtv nation and will buy whatever is said to be cool, what ever is to be marketed to you. do yourself a favour and grow the f^k up ok? first of all its nothing but rapping, screaming, and distorted guitars, secondly they ripped off KoRn, a band who started a musical revolution in 1994 with their dark horror stories of abuse and alienation, it was pure hate filled music and after countless ripoffs we get this crap, this vile crap. you little kidies can go listen to your watered down distorted rap wile i go pop in some white zombie, cheers.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Finally picked up this set today after checking my local big box mega-retailer two or three times last week to see if it was back in stock.  This won't be a very comprehensive review since I've only sat through the first disc so far, but if nothing else, I can at least say that after reading some of the complaining and nitpicking from other reviewers, I am truly ashamed to be an American tonight.<br /><br />For a relatively minor star from the Rock & Roll galaxy like Bob Geldof to fill up two of the biggest stadiums in the world with such a wide array of talent, it was truly an impressive feat to say the least.  As with all spontaneous musical events, Live Aid had its high points and its not-so-high points.  But who played what with whom where was hardly the issue here.  This was one day where hundreds of thousands of music fans got together to do something truly magnificient for the people of Ethopia, and I think many of the other reviewers here are missing that very important point entirely.<br /><br />I remember getting up super-early that morning and turning on MTV to catch the Boomtown Rats play a few tunes to an audience bigger than the combined number of people who had even heard of the band up to that point.  Later that day, I tossed my Panasonic boombox in the back of my '66 Mustang convertible and drove around listening to the show with a good friend for most of the afternoon.  It really was a special day in my life, and I think I appreciate re-living it through this DVD set even more now knowing how much good came from this effort.<br /><br />So rather than spending your money on some other pointless crap this year, I suggest that every fat, lazy and spoiled American music lover who reads this review immediately adds this collection to their shopping carts.  With the huge range of musical styles and eras covered, there is bound to be something you like somewhere amongst the ten-plus hours of video presented here. And if nothing else, you will be contributing to the legacy of a charitable organization that has helped so many people over the years, and will continue to provide aid to them from the proceeds of this release.  Because the whole point of the holiday season is to share and appreciate what you have, and not to dwell on what you think you are missing, isn't it?ontributing to the legacy of a charitable organization that has helped so many people over the years, and will continue to provide aid to them from the proceeds of this release.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\" spins a yarn about one of the great yarn-spinners of all time, Ed Bloom, and it does so in the enchanting fashion that makes great story-tellers proud. <br /> <br />The present-day Bloom (played by the great Albert Finney) is in the twilight of his life, beset by cancer and soon destined to leave this mortal coil.  According to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Bloom has filled his life with telling fantastic lies embellished with ridiculous fables enhanced by Bloom's own mythical view of himself.  And Will has had enough of it, rejecting his father to work in Paris as a \\"just the facts\\" reporter - the duality is obvious:  Dad tells false but interesting tales, while Son writes factual-yet-drab articles.  As Will says, \\"Dad, you're like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined... you're just as charming, and just as fake.\\" Against his wishes, Will returns home to be with his dad, along with his pregnant wife, during his last days. <br /> <br />As various characters interact with the dying Bloom, he continues to relate various tales about his past, which allows Burton to go into full flashback mode.  According to himself, the younger Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor (one of the most likable actors working today), did lead one heck of a fantastic life, replete with witches, giants, werewolves, circus performers, Siamese twins, international intrigue, romances and, of course, a really big fish.  Burton invests each of the various episodes in Bloom's past with a wonderful combination of realism and fantasy.  One thing to remember about people who live in a fantasy world - to them, it's normal, and they tend to act like normal people.  It is refreshing that for all the fantastic things Bloom saw and experienced, none of the characters appear to be too over-the-top or cartoonish.   <br /> <br />This being a Burton film, also beware his trademark black humor.  If you've seen other Burton films, it should come as no surprise that one character gets his comeuppance by having a heart attack on the john while \\"reading\\" a Playboy.  (And what a wonderful comeuppance it is!) <br /> <br />Initially, Will refuses to engage his father's tales, and many stories are told to Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard).  But then Will's mom (Jessica Lange) tells Will to start going through all of his father's accumulated personal effects from his long life, and Will starts to see some proof of his father's legendary exploits.  And young Will gradually sees the wisdom in his father's penchant for exaggerating his own legends . . . and one of the movie's best moments comes when Will realizes that he's got a bit of Dad's storytelling ability running through his veins.   <br /> <br />Beautifully shot, well-written, and well-acted (although one wishes that Jessica Lange had more to do with her role), \\"Big Fish\\" is sure to enchant viewers who appreciate a good story, and a heart-felt ending will have more than a few viewers dabbing the corners of their eyes.   <br /> <br />The DVD has some decent extras, but nothing out of the ordinary (we're not talking about a Peter Jackson 4-DVD pack here).  The pictures and sound are great - a good DVD for a delightful film.   <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|People who must have car chases, love scenes, or dramatic arguments will not enjoy this film. It explores the nuances of everyday, frustrated people and how friendship and humanity intertwine. Beckett and Seinfeld fans may enjoy it. It is a film where \\"nothing\\" happens - unless you look beneath the layers and see how the people have related and changed. It's very magical.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Some movies have all the luck and time their arrivals perfectly.  Fortunately for movie-lovers, two recent musicals have hit the jackpot.  2001's \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was a hit (more so on DVD than in the theater) because Americans were hungering for musicals and didn't even know it.  2002's \\"Chicago\\" good timing may not have been as much of a surprise, but its combination of great music, good dance numbers, racy songs, and ultimately its cynical take on America's infatuation with fame are just plain irresistible.   <br /> <br />An interpretation of Bob Fosse's 1975 theater production (Fosse was from Chicago and was in love with the seedy underworld that dominated the city's headlines), \\"Chicago\\" revolves around Roxie Hart's impassioned murder of her lover - a word to the wise, if you've seduced an ambitious starlet with tall tales of your ability to get her into a big show, you should break the bad news to her in a letter, not in her bedroom after a tryst.  Tempers run hot with theatrical types, you know.   <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger plays the nave Mrs. Hart, and her performance is a lot of fun for fans of her other work.  Zellweger usually plays characters who are smarter than everyone around them assumes.  In \\"Chicago,\\" Zellweger allows her ambition to trump her I.Q., and it's not much of a contest - but it's a blast to watch this talented actress dial up the clueless factor.   <br /> <br />Zellweger's dancing and singing are also a pleasant surprise - after \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" we're getting used to being surprised at how good some actors can be with the hoofing and the singing.   <br /> <br />Hart is married to a loveable shlub of a mechanic, Amos, played by John C. Reilly, who is even more nave than his wife.  He refuses to take the fall for Roxie after realizing that the deceased was their furniture salesman, and he gave them a 10% discount out of the blue.  But Amos, \\"Mr. Cellophane,\\" allows himself to be led by the nose for most of the movie, and Reilly's performance is pitch-perfect.  And what pipes!   <br /> <br />Locked away on Death Row (Roxie asks of these special accommodations in the prison, \\"Is it nicer?\\"), Roxie first turns to prison warden Big Mama (Queen Latifah).  In a musical number for the ages, \\"When You're Good to Mama,\\" Latifah almost steals the entire show.  This song is a masterpiece of double-entendre and attitude, and Latifah nails it perfectly.   <br /> <br />Mama turns Roxie on to \\"the best criminal lawyer in Illinois,\\" Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), a fast-talking flim-flam artist with a law degree who will represent Roxie for the princely sum of $5,000.  Despite his professed modesty, Flynn believes that he could have changed world history if Jesus had only had $5,000 and lived in Chicago rather than Galilee.   <br /> <br />Gere has the attitude, the looks, and the charm to play Flynn, although it must be said that his singing and dancing numbers don't quite seem up to par - but in a way this works because it reminds us that Gere is first and foremost and actor, not a Broadway hoofer, and it is refreshing to see Gere taking such a bold stab at such a challenging role.  By virtually ignoring the law and playing to the crowd with the \\"old razzle-dazzle,\\" Flynn attempts to get Roxie off. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Roxie, her murder trial bumps another murder trial off the front page - the murder of Veronica Kelly by her sister, Velma (played with cynical gusto by Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose stage background is readily apparent).  Can anyone play a rhymes-with-witch like this lady?  Kelly learns the hard way about the pain of falling from the top of the pedestal, and just how big the gap is between headlining and page sixteen.  But she is not one to sit back, and her scheming also offers a threat to young Roxie's chances for getting off.   <br /> <br />A pell-mell musical with style and wit to spare, \\"Chicago\\" does not offer many surprises as far as plot or character development go - everyonestays basically true to their nature - but the pleasures of watching this amazing cast perform this raunchy musical are exquisite.   <br />
B00005JMXX|1.0|I bought this DVD and I deeply regret it.  I liked the movie alot, but this DVD is a rip-off.  I just learned from surfing the web that our fellow consumers in Britain, Australia, and Japan can buy this film in a 2-disc Special Edition.  This 2-disc set is so much better than the puny, incomplete version that is selling in the U.S.A. (which only has audio commentaries and 2 measely deleted scenes as extras).  To be specific, the foreign 2-disc edition has (in addition to the commentaries) 10 Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Roland Emmerich and Mark Gordon, an In-Depth Look Behind The Making Of Day After Tomorrow, and many, many other extras. <br />20th Century Fox studio should be ashamed of itself for not releasing the 2-disc Special Edition in the U.S. when it could easily have done so.  The reason for this is that Fox will likely release the Special Edition in the future to get us to pay another $20 for these great extras which should have been included in this first disc.  Shame on you 20th Century Fox!
0765309408|5.0|I loved this book.  The book was engaging from the first page right through the last. I really enjoyed the way that John integrated humor throughout the book, especially at very unexpected moments in the story.  I actually found myself laughing out loud a couple of times.  He created some very good characters and a story that was always interesting and exciting.  I found that I had a really hard time putting the book down and was disappointed when I was finished with it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good read.
B000067G3C|5.0|Hotshot cops Keanu Reaves and Jeff Daniels race the clock to rescue helpless hostages from a mad bomber.  The title is well earned as this edge-of-your-seat thriller keeps the energy level at a constant high pace. From an elevator rigged to blow to the runaway bus, the bomber stays one step ahead in a fiendish game of cat and mouse. Highly recommend!
B000063DFN|4.0|As with all other Iron Maiden albums, except for the newest cd out liek 2000 or something (what a discrace to the name), its great. I personally like Number of the Beast and also Somewhere in Time more becuase it sounds more like what they started at. And as for that dumbass Avril Fan... I think that you really shouldnt judge what you don't know anything about. If youre into metal then you got a right to give your opinion but if you have no clue and don't appreciate the art here than keep your thoughts to yourself. You'll never find me rating Avril or any other pop for that matter becuase thats just not my deal. and the same goes out to anyone who goes and rates Marilyn Manson and leaves a one line responce stating \\"Marilyn Manson Ewe\\". Well i think that the album is definitly worth the money. Enjoy.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Bruce Willis and his colorful crew of offshore oil drillers team up with the astronauts to save Earth from a killer asteroid in a thrilling adventure. Steve Buschemi is priceless as the crazed genius and Ben Affleck as the Boy Dad Doesn't Want To Marry His Little Princess. The soundtrack, headlined of course by Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Want to Miss A Thing\\" is great - (nice of them to cast Steve Tyler's daughter Liv, too) but the action almost gets to be too much at times. The space station blows, the shuttle crashes, the drill bits break, the bomb won't go off....after awhile it's almost \\"Enough Already! End the movie!\\" so I'm only giving it four stars. Still, it's fun
0451191153|5.0|To begin, a review of this epochal novel:  Tremendously well written, except in the area of dialogue(one of Rand's inherent flaws as a writer); brilliant characterization and description.  Well(and tightly) plotted, with a memorable ending. <br /> <br />To finish, some complaints for my fellow reviewers:   <br /> <br />1) the \\"Rape\\" scene- If any of you had actually bothered to READ the work, you would have noticed a convenient part:  <br /> <br /> \\"They had been united in understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action; had she meant less to him, he wouldn't have taken her as he did; had he meant less to her, she would not have fought so desperately. The unrepeatable exaltation was in knowing that they both understood this.\\" <br /> <br />It was, in the strict definition of the word, a rape: he did not ask her consent; however, in the true meaning of the word 'consent', she granted it in every way.  That was how they both needed it to be done.  Roark is not a vicious rapist. <br /> <br />I have seen other reviewers complain that the novel did not give them the happy feeling they damn well have a right to expect in a novel; boo hoo.  Go read some Pooh Bear if you want lovey-dovey nonsense--- you won't find it here.  Roark, by his nature, is a cold(though not unfeeling) person.  You complain about his lack of compassion; what is compassion?  Feeling for others, for no reason other than they happen to be the others.  Roark, as a perfect embodiment of individuality, does not grant his emotions  frivolously; he considers them an intrinsic part of who he is---you don't share yourself with everybody. <br /> <br />But I can't expect a group of quasi-intellectual plebians to understand such obviously complex ideas. What can you do when you deal with people...ah well, c'est la vie.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|The aliens are real but they don't want to be taken to our leader...they want to eliminate the leader and everyone else. The film uses very subtle tongue-in-cheek humor throughout (at the beginning of the movie, the SETI personnel are listening to \\"It's The End of the World As We Know It\\" on the radio) and takes the audience on wild ride. Wil Smith puts Han Solo to shame as the hotshot air force pilot and Judd Hirsch steals several scenes with his dry, irreverent humor. Randy Quaid gives a hilarious performance as the space abduction victim nobody ever believed. Special effects are great and so's the story. The Fourth of July was never so much fun
B000268QB2|5.0|One of the best new bands from the other side of the atlantic in quite some time. Well written, performed even better, and all without that instrument so often used, what was it again? Oh yeah the guitar. These guys lost their lead guitarist only to find a new sound in Hopes & Fears that has begun to catapult them onto the world stage. This is definitely a departure from today's typical pop. Give them a listen, if its not your cup of tea thats cool, but I think after a few songs you can't help but listen to the rest.
0451169514|2.0|Now, I admit, I waited a long time to read this book. I've read almost all of King's other books (The Stand and Carrie being my favorites) but this story never appealed to me. Maybe I was just sick the Stand By Me type of stories that are out there these days. Then one summer's day, I finally broke down...fished the book out of my closet and began to read. <br /> <br />After finishing it, I was pretty unimpressed. I think King had the right idea, but he could have spent more time on it. The 1958 era was fine. I thought King did a great job fleshing out the characters. I fell in love with those kids and wished I could see them on \\"normal\\" days when they weren't worried about getting killed by a bully or a clown. <br /> <br />The thing that really disappointed me was the true identity of IT. I was expecting something like Randall Flagg. Some monsterous demon that chose Derry as his country home. Instead, IT is really...I'm not quite sure. To make that creature some kind of \\"other\\" from space felt cheap and contrived to me. I thought the idea was more frightening to have IT be the demon who can turn into a clown or whatever our fears believe. To make the final battle some cosmic thing was too hokey and lame for me.  <br /> <br />Finally, I didn't like how King used sex to \\"unite\\" things in the book. Some of it seemed really pointles...like the Henry and Patrick bit.  <br /> <br />Overall, I was hugely disappointed by this book. It's alright to read if you want to cover all of King's books, but I'd recommend \\"The Stand\\" or even the weepy \\"Green Mile\\" if you want a good King experience.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is that something that we have been missing and thanks to the Postal Service and the other Postal Service, we have one of the best albums to come out in the past two years. Gibbard and Tambarello have put together a gem, one that truthfully doesn't get old. This album is one of maybe 3 that at any given moment I'd have no problem listening to regardless of my mood. Definitely a must have in any CD collection. There is simply nothing else like it.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Fans of the books will love this DVD set.  The adaptation was done well and provides the true flavor of Wodehouse in a visual medium.  If you haven't read the books or just don't like to read - this is your opportunity to see what the rest of enjoy about the writings of Wodehouse.
1592400876|5.0|It's a grammar book for sticklers and non-sticklers alike. Not only is it humorous and enjoyable read, but it's a great resource for punctuation quirks. Truss presents the little grammar lessons in a very loose, readable style and deals with almost all the punctuation marks anyone would ever need to use.  <br /> <br />Not something to read when no one's supposed to know you're reading, though. It's a bit of a snigger out loud book.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|Boiled down to the fine little dish of steak tar-tar that it is, \\"Underworld\\" is the answer to the two horror flick questions you had as a kid:<br /><br />1) If Dracula and the Wolfman went mano a mano and fang-to-claw, which one would do the thrashing?<br /><br />2) If Dracula and the Wolfman checked into a cheap motel, got roaring drunk on a case of Night Train, and had a baby, what would it look like?<br /><br />You get the answer to #1 early and often, which is pretty much what this Transylvania Station is all about.  And by the end of \\"Underworld\\" you get #2 as well---and trust me, when it's hopping about like an ugly green Mini-Hulk (right down to its one-size-fits-all-monster trunks) you'll wish you hadn't.<br /><br />You want to know what you're getting when you lace up your thigh-high attitude boots and strap on that trenchcoat for a little midnight fun in Len Wiseman's uber-stylish little monster mash \\"Underworld\\"?<br /><br />Think West Side Story: only here, instead of the Jets and the Sharks angling for a rumble on the other side of the tracks, we have Vampires and Werewolves.  Oh, and in \\"Underworld\\" nobody breaks into song.  Both sides just want to rumble, and the girls just wanna have fun. In the meantime, while not the sharpest stake in the vamp-hunter kitbag, \\"Underworld\\" finds its groove, and serves up a bloody two hours of unabashed techno-cool that drinks you dry, trashes the apartment and howls at the moon.<br /><br />We get dropped into the middle of a war that Celine (the impossibly tasty Kate Beckinsdale)---our supple full-body-suit clad vampiric Death Dealer and narrator---tells us has been \\"raging for centuries.\\"<br /><br />On one side of the tracks: the sneering, brutally hip Euro-trashy leather-trenchcoat & hip-sunglasses wearing uber-high-maintenance Vampires.  They have posh high-rent neo-Victorian digs, drive around the streets in Jaguars and Maseratis, and have managed to switch up the silver bullets in their glocks and MP-5 submachine guns for something more lethal: liquid silver nitrate, which makes it tougher for their hairy buddies to pull the bullets out.  Advantage: Vampires.<br /><br />On the other side of the tracks: the Salvation Army surplus-wearing tear-your-scalp-off-and-wear-it Werewolves---erm, I mean Lycans, short for Lycanthropes.  The Lycans are strictly low-rent, hang out together in what looks like an abandoned public lavatory, and take a bath once every full moon whether they need it or not.  Whereas their blood-sucking cousins from the East Side look like they'd be hanging at crazy underground raves when they're not boring each other to tears talking like the Merovingian, the Lycans are strictly the mosh-pit set.  Oh, and from what I could tell, there's not a single werewolf girl.  C'mon guys---haven't ya heard of \\"Ginger Snaps\\"?  Bummer.  Advantage: Vampires.<br /><br />That said, the boys have been pumping the rent money they've saved up into super-science research, giving them bullets that encase super-photoelectric magnesium charges (perfect for giving that oncoming vamp a little taste of Club Med sunlight).  They also have the upper hand in figuring out how they can mix the bloodlines, bringing the war between Vamp and Lycan to an end.  Advantage: Lycans.<br /><br />And finally, mixing it up with our fanged-kissin' cousins, we have perplexed med student Michael Corvin (played by the annoying Scott Speedman who cashes a check) stalked by Lycan heavies and tagged by Selene, who wants to know why the werewolf army is so eager to get their hands on him.<br /><br />And that, pretty much, is \\"Underworld\\": two hours of movie built around jaw-droppingly gorgeous set-pieces and bouts of total war between locked-and-loaded squads of Things that go Bump in the Night.<br /><br />Just a note: you'll want to get the Unrated Extended DVD: it fleshes things out, beefs up some supporting characters, and ends with an extended battle sequence---and it's loaded down with plenty of extras you can sink your fangs into.<br /><br />Plus, the sleeker transfer shows off Wiseman's technical mastery in spades.  Wiseman uses sound-stages and CGI to anchor the film's look, and tethers all of it to the fog-shrouded cobbled streets and ancient alleys of Prague: the City itself takes on a bleak and brooding character.  The movie looks gorgeous: whether it's the gloomy red-velvet and dark mahogany halls of the mansion, the sleek, sterile Underground, or the industrial ruins of the Lycans, Wiseman and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts make every scene tell.  The sequence where a locomotive full of vampire diplomats chugs into a deserted rail-station---with the baying of werewolves in the distance---is jaw dropping.<br /><br />\\"Underworld\\" also gets the most out of its talented stable of actors.  There are three centers of gravity in the film: Beckinsdale, who doesn't need her bodysuit to command her lines (though I'm glad she wore it).  The Lycan overlord Lucien (the gifted Welsh actor Michael Sheen) steals every scene he's in, and brings complexity and command to a role that could have been a throwaway in lesser hands.  Finally, there's the Vampire King Viktor, played by the great Bill Nighy (who also played Shaun's Jag-loving stepdad in \\"Shaun of the Dead\\").  Nighy is a kind of demonic embodiment of immortal Puritan rage, and acts like a champ through all that make-up.<br /><br />Even the supporting actors turn in strong roles: Shane Brolly (Kraven) whines and pouts and lisps and turns in a convincing performance as a spineless worm; Sophia Myles (Erika) comes off as a naughty little vampire cat-girl; Kevin Grevioux owns this film and puts the smack down as Uber-Werewolf Raze; and Hungarian actress Zita Gorog rocked my world---without uttering a single line.<br /><br />In the end, this batwinged black-lipstick wearing looker of a flick charged into the goth club of my choice, served me an extra-bloody steak tartar , smacked me around, bought me drinks, and talked Shakespeare after.  Would a Lycan by any other name be just as hairy?with plenty of extras you can sink your fangs into.  <br /> <br />Plus, the sleeker transfer shows off Wiseman's technical mastery in spades.

B0006284JQ|5.0|This album is simply incomparable!  This CD features some of the BIGGEST pop hits in the history of music all on ONE CD!  The albuum had an average debut on American charts with 255,000 copies sold in its first week.  You may think Britney is losing her touch going from an insane 1.3 million copies for Oops and in the 600-700k range for her next two albums Britney and In The Zone.  The thing is, Britney is an INTERNATIONAL artist!  Unlike some artists that can only reach success in the USA, Britney has recaptured the world's interest with hits like Toxic and Everytime!  The album hit #1 in HUGE world markets like Japan and France, and recently moved up to the top in Brazil!  The album hit #1 in over many countries around the world and in UK, the album had the BIGGEST one-week sales of ANY greatest hits albums by a female EVER, beating GH albums by Shania, Celine, Madonna, Mariah, Kylie, etc.!   <br /> <br />Greatest Hits: My Prerogative features the title track My Prerogative and Britney's BIGGEST hits including one of 2004's biggest songs, Toxic, I'm A Slave 4 U, Oops!...I Did It Again, Me Against The Music (feat. Madonna) and OF COURSE, the pop classic ...Baby One More Time!   <br /> <br />This album is a GREAT stocking stuffer as it will please most pop fans because of the sheer variety: from hard-hitting dance and hip-hop tracks (Overprotected [Darkchild Remix], Boys [Co-Ed Remix feat. Pharrell], and one of her latest, the catchy R.Kelly track, Outrageous), beautiful ballads (Not A Girl and this year's smash hit Everytime), to all the CLASSICS from fun pure pop like Sometimes and Lucky to MEGAHITS like (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix) and Stronger! <br /> <br />The album also features two of Britney's best songs EVER, the internet hit I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) and the incredibly hot and catchy Do Somethin'!  Then you also have the bonus disc which features some of the best remixes ever, with some being just as good, if not better than the originals (eg. Outrageous)!  You'll also find a gem in Chris Cox's Megamix, which features some of Britney's biggest hits all on one song!  The remix is very well done and features some very cool new beats!  This was released in Europe and is doing amazing! <br /> <br />These songs contributed to Britney selling over 60 million albums and around 30 million singles worldwide!  Basically 90 million records sold in the span of what...6 years!?!?   <br /> <br />If you're a Britney hater or someone who just doesn't like pop music, I'm not trying to convince you to buy the album.  Just PLEASE do not write dumb reviews dissing Britney!  If you don't like the album, then write a review stating why.  Just don't resort to having to bring Britney down or say bad things about her just because you don't like her music!  For those who DO like Britney and pop music and have not yet got the album...SHAME ON YOU!  Hahhaha..Pick this up ASAP and get a few extra copies for your friends and family!  You WILL NOT be disappointed!
B000696RIY|5.0|The main disc is just as listed here with the extra tracks not on the US edition, but I ordered this version due to the different tracks on the bonus CD. I got some surprises. Here is the breakdown:<br /><br />1. Toxic (armand van helden remix)--The disc's case calls this the \\"edit\\" but it is indeed the full 9 minute and 34 second version found on the US 12\\" single, not the 6 and a half minute edit found on the US bonus disc.<br /><br />2. Everytime--the track listing is WRONG here on Amazon. This is not a Valentin mix. it's the same hi-bias radio edit from the US edition.<br /><br />3. Breathe on Me--same Jacques Lu Cont mix as US bonus disc.<br /><br />4. Outrageous--same Junkie XL Dancehall mix as US bonus disc.<br /><br />5. Stronger(miguel mig's vocal mix)--this boring 6 and a half minute version is on the US CD single for this song.<br /><br />6. I'm a Slave 4U--this is the FULL 8 minute and 46 second thunderpuss mix from the US 12\\" single, finally on CD!!!<br /><br />7. Chris Cox megamix--same 5 minute version as on the US bonus CD.<br /><br />Hope this helps all the collectors. It's worth it for Tracks 1 and 6 on CD, I'd say.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Please, if you are even slightly considering this album...BUY IT.  I originally bought it as a birthday present for a friend, but quickly bought a copy for myself after hearing the first couple of songs.  The greatest part is that the album contains quite a few different musical styles.  It goes from upbeat rock to inspiring johnny cash-ish ballads.  This CD makes up for all the other crap that is showing up out there.
B0002VEW1K|5.0|Procol Harum's 1974 release, \\"Exotic Birds And Fruit,\\" is one of the group's finest albums. It may not boast any \\"hits,\\" but diehard Harum fans know classic Harum songs when they hear them, and \\"Exotic Birds\\" contains many of them, such as the thumping \\"Nothing But The Truth,\\" the drinking-song pastiche \\"Beyond The Pale,\\" the fine melodies of \\"As Strong As Samson\\" (with one of Keith Reid's very best lyrics: \\"Ain't no use in preacher's preaching/When they don't know what they're teaching\\"), the spooky \\"The Thin Edge Of The Wedge,\\" the playful \\"Fresh Fruit,\\" and the rockin' \\"Butterfly Boys.\\" The band, led by singer/pianist extraordinaire Gary Brooker, sound superb on this one. Thumbs up all the way on Procol Harum's \\"Exotic Birds And Fruit.\\"

Skipping Christmas deals with a family that decides not to \\"celebrate\\" Christmas, since their daughter has decided to go into South American jungles to do missionary work. The book is well written, and Grisham does an excellent job maintaining the reader's interest. I believe that I liked Bleachers more, but nonetheless, this is a good holiday read.
0613657578|4.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld series has topped British bestseller lists for years and has a sizable fanbase in the United States as well. Now, with rodent adventure \\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents,\\" Pratchett expands Discworld from adult fantasy to young adult fantasy as well.<br /><br />A boy, a cat, and a troupe of rats arrive at the town of Bad Blintz. But while Keith is normal, feline Maurice and his \\"educated rodents\\" are not -- they speak, think, and are self-aware (they ate wizards' garbage). And they have a nice racket going, where the rats pretend to infest a town (they gnaw things and \\"widdle\\" on the flour), and Keith poses as a piper to lead them away. But something is wrong with Bad Blintz -- there are no native rats, yet the rat-catchers claim that there's an outright plague of them, and are producing rat-tails to prove it. (They bear a remarkable resemblance to shoelaces)<br /><br />With the help of a too-imaginative-for-her-own good girl named Malicia, Keith and Maurice begin to investigate why all the rats are gone, and what the rat-catchers are up to. But when they discover the conspiracy, Maurice starts hearing the voice of something down in the sewers -- something evil, something powerful, something that can command hundreds of rats...<br /><br />Pratchett is reknowned for his new spins on old material. Much as he gave a new spin to MacBeth in \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" here he gives a new spin to the \\"Pied Piper\\" legend, with some interesting philosophy and his trademarked humor as well. Does the idea of talking animals and preteens make you cringe? Don't -- Pratchett handles it with rare style.<br /><br />There's plenty of humor in this book, from the names of the rats (Dangerous Beans, Additives, Big Savings, Toxie) to Sardines, the tap-dancing rat with a hat to the incident with the laxatives. His dialogue is still brilliant, especially when he deflates tense scenes (\\"Think of my dear wife and my four lovely children who'll be without their daddy!\\" \\"You're not married. You don't have any children!\\" \\"I might want some day!\\").<br /><br />But Pratchett doesn't forget the deeper currents either -- the sense of evil he builds up is very genuine, and Spider is one of the most unique fantasy villains he's created. Also good is the attitude of the Changed rats: they cherish their greater intelligence, fear their instincts, and gradually we see them overcome some of those ratty instincts. Rather than eating one of their dead, they bury him like humans do.<br /><br />Keith is a nice character, seeming dim but surprisingly intelligent. Maurice is the character that Pratchett does best -- he seems, initially, to have no good characteristis, but he's a good person underneath. (With a dirty little secret involving one of the rats) The Educated Rodents are all given individual personalities that Pratchett juggles very well. And Dangerous Beans, a little blind rat, has one of the best scenes in which he confronts the mysterious Spider.<br /><br />\\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" isn't actually that different from Pratchett's adult fantasies, and older fans of that series will enjoy this one just as much as the kids. Witty, thought-provoking, entertaining.thout their daddy!\\" \\"You're not married.

0156907399|5.0|Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is an underappreciated masterpiece. Though often overshadowed by \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" (which certainly deserves its repute), \\"To the Lighthouse\\" stands on its own as a great classic. It chronicles the lives of the Ramsay family and some friends, examining human relationships and emotions with great insight. The characters are elegant and well developed, the writing is lovely, and the form is daring and innovative. \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a rare kind of book that can change the way you read characters.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Okay, so maybe it's not the greatest movie ever, but it's still totally hilarious.  I was a little disappointed in a movie that wasn't going to involve Saddam Hussein, but rest assured, Kim Il Jong is just as screwed up and he has a much better singing voice... <br /> <br />For anybody who's been paying attention to politics of late (especially the Hollywood whackjobs who think we give a crap what they think) and is tired of it all, you'll find this movie totally hilarious. <br /> <br />Yeah, the puppet sex is a little out there (didn't stop me from laughing however) and the puppet barfing scene is goes a little far, but hey, would they be Trey Parker and Matt Stone if they didn't go too far? <br /> <br />I laughed so hard through this movie (both times I saw it) that I got a headache.  I've never been so happy about a headache in my life. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this to people with a dry sense of humor, but please don't let your kids watch it.

This album just is very raw and shows how kurt and krist and dave wanted to actually sound unlike Nevermind which was a liitle to \\"poppy\\" for them. This album alos is very diverse in its tracks from the hard core grind of \\"tourett's\\" to the soft beatifully written \\"Dumb\\" to the great soft to loud sound we all love \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" This is an album w/ everything on it for the good fan.

The plot has some good twists, and Haddon always keeps you interested. It is a great book to pick up and read.
B000696RIY|1.0|Rarely has someone been so famous for so little, and that fact shines through in \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative.\\" While much-publicized pop star Britney Spears has produced four albums thus far, all that becomes clear in her \\"greatest hits\\" is that her music has never been that good, and it's only getting worse.<br /><br />This contains several of her hit singles, arranged in no particular order -- expect to bounce madly between slinky technopop and bouncy bubblegum with no logic in mind -- the obvious hits like \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" (future bondage-porn soundtrack?), \\"... Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" are set alongside much lesser pop hits like \\"Toxic,\\" the flaccid Madonna duet, and several others that were more or less forgotten.<br /><br />Like virtually any other greatest hits album, it has some bonus materials. There are from several remixes, none of which are too good -- for example, the Darkchild Remix of \\"Overprotected\\" is a clattery, feedback-laced affair. Spears also releases several previously unheard songs, such as the generic \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" and equally dull \\"Do Somethin'.\\" The most hyped song is \\"My Prerogative,\\" an electropop cover of a Bobby Brown song -- with lyrics like \\"I don't need permission/I make my own decisions,\\" it sounds like an immature, defiant finger-flip at the world. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Usually \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums are put out for one of two reasons. Either a band/singer has been around for eons and has enough glorious songs to fill an entire album, or the label they are/were signed to is trying to cash in. For the latter, think \\"Best of Mandy Moore,\\" which Ms. Moore had nothing to do with. Sadly, Spears' \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is neither -- instead, it feels like an effort to keep her at the forefront of music store displays.<br /><br />Her music is pretty standard for whatever kind of pop is attempted -- polished and overproduced. And, I might add, very predictable -- virtually every blip and note can be detected before it's heard. While \\"Toxic\\" has a halfway decent beat and some electric violins, Spears strikes out with her newer pop melodies, especially the ones that sound a lot like No Doubt covers.<br /><br />Her image also veers wildly through the various songs, starting off with the sound of a giggly teen who has done something naughty. Then she's launching into the more sexual stuff, especially in the horribly-written \\"Outrageous\\" (\\"Outrageous!/My sex drive/Outrageous!/My shopping sprees....\\"). But it doesn't feel genuinely sexy -- rather it feels like a little girl dressing up in mommy's lingerie.<br /><br />And Spears' vocals have never been too good -- her early material displays a voice that is pretty typical for a teenage girl. It has little range, and it's a sort of breathy, thin voice. That doesn't last -- her voice deteriorates over the more recent tracks from her fourth album, becoming drier and more computerized. The sound peaks in \\"My Prerogative,\\" where Spears sounds like a congested robot.<br /><br />Everyone has an opinion on Spears' much-publicized love life, but the quality of her pop music is pretty clear. While her early material was innocuous in a teen pop sort of way, her pop ditties have only deteriorated with time.before it's heard.

B00006M183|2.0|This album makes Binaural look really good (as a matter of fact, I like Binaural a lot more than I did after hearing this album). <br /> <br />This album does have some great songs: Can't Keep, Save You, I Am Mine, Thumbing My Way, 1/2 Full, and All Or None.  Buy it if you like, and burn a new 6-track CD with only those songs on it and listen to it for the first time.  After you've become familiar with them, listen to the others and you will find out why I gave it 2 stars. <br /> <br />The main problem with the other songs is their lack of listenability/hooks.  Great Lyrics account for nothing if the music is un-moving.  The music written may be a result of focusing too much on techniqe or difficulty, and not enough on content, or it may be a result of wanting everyone to contribute to the point of not turning away the ideas of others, even if they are not good.  They also can't seem to fathom the fact that political issues are not best decided in the eyes of others by 5 guys who are in a sucessful rock band. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam is a great band full of creative people.  I just think they need to be more critical of their work before they release it, and not be afraid to cull the less moving material.
038551123X|4.0|I must admit, the only crime novels I've ever picked up were ones featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple, but even these novels are of the mystery genre. Modern crime fictions are new to a young adult like me and the only other crime novels I've recently had my hands on were Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire Mysteries (again still a mystery fiction). So I was quite glad to have seen the Australian release for Jeff Lindsay's Darkly Dreaming Dexter as it offered the same formula for a good crime caper slash mystery fiction that I've enjoyed in the past, except that my new loved hero isn't such a good guy himself. What can I say? Good girls always go for bad guys.    Dexter Morgan can be said to be the most perfect guy: funny, nice to people, loves his sister, loves children, and always seem to say the right things. However, beneath the picture perfect gentleman image, Dexter kills Miami's bad guys because i) they deserved it and, more disturbingly, ii) killing satisfies The Need.     Dexter is different because a mysterious childhood made him cold and unfeeling. Thus, as the story, which is told Dexter sees it, progresses, it is quite interesting to see someone who is apathetic towards other humans impersonate them and try to blend in. This insight into a serial killer's thought is one of the main positive features of the book especially when this unsympathetic good murderer is a sarcastic one. What I love about this book is that there didn't seem to be any irrelevant parts so you couldn't really put the book down until you find out what happens next. It's a page turner, but it seemed to be one of the weakest points as it was like wanting to get to the destination but fearing the end of the thrilling ride.    However, the characters were kind of a downside. Deborah, Dexter's sister, appears to be more a whiner than a professional cop who matched LaGuerta's incompitence at police detective work. I wondered to myself why Dexter wasn't a detective himself but a blood spatter analyst. He knew how vile criminals think, yet he hated blood. Another thing was that he spent more of his time where he wasn't needed rather than analyzing blood spatter patterns on other crimes comitted. What's up with that? Last gripe with the novel was that the action part could've been hiked up a notch.    All in all, the ending was great and has led to me to believe that Dexter, and hopefully Rita as she had about a few pages in this, will certainly be appearing in more Lindsay novels. As they say, the lighter the picture, the darker the negative, and I just can't wait to read about what happens inside the dark recesses of Dexter's own dark mind.

0140293469|4.0|Nick Hornby gives music and romance a philosophical spin in \\"High Fidelity,\\" the funny, rueful book about men, music, and modern love. While occasionally his lead character's \\"top five\\" lists can be a little annoying, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our time.<br /><br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br /><br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees -- these guys alone are worth checking out the book for. He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br /><br />Thirty-five is kind of old to start growing up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die -- in his case, alone and surrounded by records. \\"High Fidelity\\" is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br /><br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br /><br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br /><br />Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" is an excellent slice of Brit-lit -- it's quirky, wry, insightful, and a bit obsessed with good music.

0767817664|5.0|Yeah, it's cheesy in some places, campy in others, but, in all, it's a movie you find yourself enjoying more every time you watch it.<br /><br />And I thought I was the only one who thought Chris Sarandon was extra hot here.  If vampires look like him, I'm a willing victim!  :-)  (Tom Cruise, eat your heart out!)<br /><br />Other reviews give a detailed analysis of the plot so no need to rehash it here.  If you're looking for a good and enjoyable vampire flick 1980's style (complete with the spiky hair and cheesy club music), this is the movie for you.<br /><br />I just can't believe it's been nearly 20 years since the film's release.  But, even after all that time, it's still got it.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is one of the last great animated films from Disney, and a lot of the credit is owed to the bad guys.  The voices of Jafar and Iago are dead-on perfect for their characters and when combined with Robin Williams in a role where he can really cut loose, they create movie gold. <br /> <br />In a classic poor-boy-makes-good story, it would be easy to ignore the villian and concentrate on the \\"heart of gold\\" and love-interest storylines, but directors Clements and Musker gave plenty of screen time for the wonderfully sneering and arrogant Jafar.  The interplay between him and Gottfried as Iago is nearly as fun as listening to Williams's wide selection of impressions and verbal explosions (my favorite is Bill Buckley with \\"restrictions and quid pro quos\\"). <br /> <br />Some of the extras are snooze-inducing, but the commentary is engaging, especially if you've seen the film a few times.  This is definitely worth the upgrade from your old VHS copy.

The way the book sets up Patrick as the anti-hero gives the idea that he has everything under control from the begining. A line in the book says when planning a murder if you can think of 15 of the 25 things that can go wrong you are a genius. Well I think Patrick gets about 24 right.

B00005JMUA|3.0|The thing is, with a Tarantino flick, you basically know what you're getting into.  Yeah, Vol 1 is quirky, and lots of violence, and maybe even cheesy at times, but after seeing Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Jackie Brown, etc, what do you expect? <br /> <br />I've had discussions with friends who think the 2nd volume is better, and their main argument is that Vol 2 \\"has more plot!\\" <br />Let's make a distinction: Plot and dialogue are NOT THE SAME. Both have the same plot.  That's why it's a two volume movie.  <br /> <br />The choreography was better in the 1st Vol.  The cinamatography is way(!) better in the 1st (Consider the final showdown between Thurman and Lucy Liu -- case-in-point.)  And let's face it:  It was way more Tarantino-esque than the 2nd Vol. <br /> <br />But the 2nd Vol does have pros:  If you've seen the 1st, you MUST see the 2nd.  Admit it, you need the closure!  The 2nd does a nice job of putting everything in its place without being too over-explanatory.  Also, character development.  The dialogue and background scenes are needed to develop the characters, and make it more personal for the audience.  Also, it's very funny to see Michael Madsen play a let-himself-go loser, when we're so used to seeing him as the badass guy you love to hate!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I live in Austin, Tx and back in the 80's watched Stevie Ray Vaughn live with him about 50 feet in front of me... it changed my life and the way I look at music. He was an amazing talent...So is John Mayer - and of the same class and caliber.  <br /> <br />John's first Pop hits were great and I still love listening to them... but it wasn't until I saw him perform live on Austin City Limits that I realized the true talent and class of this artist. I literally wept with joy when I saw him play one of Stevies old songs with Double Trouble, comprised of Stevie's family and former band mates.... John Mayer is the real deal.  - He is a classic song writer, a soulful, passionate and sincere performer that is a true standout in a world of manufactured pop artists.  This man is a natural musician and a sexy man that has got many more years of great music to give.  <br /> <br />I own all of his albums. However, I'm just waiting for him to get back together with Double Trouble and do a tribute to Stevie. That would be amazing, and yes, I would truly weep with joy, again.
B00005JMUL|4.0|As to its stunning visuals, we can see no disagreement among us.  'The Polar Express' has shown where the CGIs would be leading us in the future.  However, as to its story and, well, the virtual star Tom Hanks (who looks and moves in a very weird way), there is still room for improvement to be done.  All in all I liked the film simply because I love to see newer things on the big screen.  But if you are kind of audiences who would feel dizzy after watching the flood of CGIs, you may consider buying the original book (and that's beautiful) instead. <br /> <br />The original book by Chris Van Allsburg contains only 29 pages, and for the film (that runs 100 mins), Robert Zemeckis stretched the story.  Maybe he did it too much, but anyway the film follows one boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, the kid of 'The Spy Kids') who lost his faith in Santa.  But one Christmas Eve, an old-fashioned train led by a steam locomotive stops right in front of his window.  It's The Polar Express, and The Conductor invites him to board the train to join in the travel to the North Pole. <br /> <br />The rest of the story needs no summery; The Hero Boy meets new friends, sees the elves (including one cameo played by Steven Tyler), and, yes, the man in red clothes, with white beard.  The voice cast include Tom Hanks (playing five roles), Michael Jitter (playing two roles Smokey and Steamer), Norah Gaye as Hero Girl, and Peter Scolari as Lonely Boy. <br /> <br />But the merit of the film is mostly the visuals (not those of humans, which, quite annoyingly, often look embalmed bodies in motion).  The snow-covered railroad track, the icy field on which the train slips as if skating, and the well-crafted designs of the town in the North Pole are all fantastic.  If only Tom Hanks appeared exactly as he is, without tampered by the 'performance capture' system (whatever it is). <br /> <br />The sound effects are amazing, the songs are pretty good, but the fact remains that 'The Paolar Express' is based on a very thin book -- you know what I mean if you remember 'Jumanji' which was another film based on Chrs Van Allsburg's book.  Great images with very few things to say, that's my verdict.  And very bizarre Tom Hanks, more bizarre than him in 'The Ladykillers.'
B00005A46T|5.0|Okay, if any of you have read my other reviews, you should know that I am a Slipknot fan so, needless to say, I adore this album. Okay, first off, this is not entirely true, but the reason this album has a 3.5 total review average at the moment is because people are ripping on it claiming they've hated the band for a while. To those people I must say, If you don't like the band and you have low expectations, DON'T REVIEW SOMETHING BY THEM!! If you wanna rant, go into a freakin chatroom or sumthing. and too all the closed minded, these guy ARE talented. Those who say s**t like \\"If I picked up two drumsticks and started beating on trash cans I could play better drums\\" havent seen Joey Jordison play! Even people I know who HATE this band with a PASSION think that Joey is one of the best drummers aroud once they see him in action in the Disasterpiece DVD, so SHUT YOU'R F***ING MOUTHS AND WITNESS HIS PLAYING BEFORE YOU JUDGE! And that goes for the other band members too.  <br /> <br />Anyways, to fans, yes, it might not be as good as the s/t, but its still freaking amazing! I love every song on here, including IOWA. It took me a while to settle into Skin Ticket, but once I did I fell in love. So If you're a slipknot fan, get it!! IT'S SOOO WORTH IT <br /> <br />P.S. Have you noticed that most professional reviewers are PRAISING this album as the first Metal Classic in the past decade?! Thought so and thank you for your time
B0000AXM3N|5.0|It's no secret thanks to the wonders of the internet that Thirteenth Step was a far more personal album than Mer De Noms (their first album), and was centered on problems and recovery, specificually the two main themes in it seem to be substance abuse and a single relationship's ties to the abuse problem.  Upon writing out a track by track analysis (click titles for a direct link to the lyrics), I found that it spelled out a narrative story:<br />01. The Package  The lyrics sound like a drug addict's trip to a dealer and the craving for whatever it is he's jonesing for.  The title: going in search of a package, of drugs.<br />02. Weak and Powerless  An illustration of the cotton mouth you get when you're anticipating something exciting (in this case taking the drug, but it's a feeling similar to talking to someone you're attracted to) with the knowledge that doing it is a very bad idea...but you want it anyway.  The title: the feeling one gets when about to do something exhilarating.<br />03. The Noose  The disillusionment that follows a badly ended relationship, and how you find yourself appalled by someone you used to adore.  This is quite likely a relationship that ended because of the main character's substance abuse problem, and the lyrics refer to the friend/significant other feeling shocked and disillusioned that someone they thought they knew could change so much.  The title: the descent of the addict here is represented by death via noose (also the lyric about the halo slipping down).<br />04. Blue  Blissful ignorance followed by ignoring all the obvious signs of a problem.  Also the rather obvious symbolism of someone who's not breathing turns blue.  The title: the color one turns when suffocating.<br />05. Vanishing  The lyrics here sound a lot like the experience that someone who's high describes.  The title: when (ab)users are high as a kite, the world around them seems to vanish, or alternatively they feel as though they vanish and the worldis meaningless.<br />06. A Stranger  Denying that there's any problem when the facts point to a hardcore junkie, the realization that after you've turned away everyone who cares about you how alone you are and a hate for the drug you're addicted to.  The title: how the addict has become a stranger to everyone, including himself.<br />07. The Outsider  The character from 'The Noose' reappears here and tries to help the addict.  Frustration and a strong level of bitterness quickly set in, and the character feels that the addict is a self-centered arse.  They are also pissed off about the addict's complete unwillingness to help themselves.  The title: An outsider looking in on a problem and trying to help without understanding.<br />08. Crimes  The lyrics are literally just counting 1-10, so it's a bit difficult to fit this one into the narrative.  Perhaps it's the friend/ex practicing the time-tested strategy of counting to ten to calm down.  The title: the friend/ex feels guilt over their reaction (in the previous song).<br />09. The Nurse Who Loved Me  The culmination of the addiction reaching it's highest (or lowest) point, in a massive overdose.  The title: the fondness and attachment that grows between the caregiver and the one who feels vulnerable; in this case strictly one way: the addict feeling that the care he's receiving is representative of love.<br />10. Pet  The friend/ex talking to and consoling the hospitalized post-OD addict.  The title: ?<br />11. Lullaby  The only lines in this are &quot;go back to sleep,&quot; presumably an extension of Pet in that the addict's friend/ex is essentially telling the freshly OD'd addict to rest.  The title: a lullaby is just something to soothe someone and ease them into sleep.<br />12. Gravity  The empowerment and fragility of someone recovering from substance abuse.  The addict finally enters rehab or AA and finds themselves faced with the exhilarating high of being free of addiction, and the terror ofpossibly slipping back down.  The title: the addict coming to terms with reality, and escaping from the surreal unreality of addiction.<br />As far as the album title itself goes, I really feel that 'Thirteenth Step' is a pretty obvious play on words with the twelve step program that millions of people enter into to help themselves deal with whatever problem it is that might be plaguing them.  The fact that it's 13 rather than 12 is just an extension of the addict's feelings (ie: I have the worst of luck).  It also seems to me that the album's 13th step (as in, there's 12 tracks on the CD) would be the beginning of recovery for the addict, and a commencement of a 12 step recovery program.<br />Even the album cover supports the notion of substance abuse, in that the slug is very similar in appearance (color excepted) to a leech.  And a leech is pretty obvious symbolism for a drain on one's life, something that a dependency on drugs and/or alcohol clearly is.<br />Is this enough to qualify it as a conceptual album?  I don't know.  But I reckon so, and if you've missed this album you've missed out.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I am a classical trained cellist and I really enjoyed this album. I consider it's the best crossover work done by Yo-Yo Ma so far. He's been playing some music in the past few years which I don't care much personally (it's the nature of the music, not his playing), but anyone would rate this album one star is probably tone deaf or knows nothing about cello playing. This is a very consistent album. I couldn't pick out any bad one among the 21 cuts. The melodies are nice (I'm familiar with those movies), the arrangement is superb, but it is Yo-Yo Ma's virtuoso playing brings this album to a whole new level. In many ways, he plays this instrument more like a violin, with many  hair-raising  weeping stunning high notes which most classical composition couldn't provide for the instrument. And it's amazing that he can play them so effortlessly with absolute precision in dynamics and attack, and  with pure tonal quality. One more interesting observation, some passages are very Chinese instrument sounding, even the music is done by an Italian composer.

Even if your not a fan of Michael Jackson this is an excellent christmas present. It is a collection of all MJ's best hits dating back to the Jackson 5, through the days of Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, History, Blood On The Dance Floor and Invincible and new songs. The DVD of Michael's concert is spactacular and cannot be summed up into words. The  65 page colour booklet just puts the icing on the cake for the best box set currently on the market.

The band's playful, over-the-top antics was actually a strength & seemed to be a reflection of their powerful live shows--at first. But as the film progresses, you can witness the ramifications of those antics, ultimately becoming a weakness too noticible to ignore...it's quite sad seeing Keith Moon, once indestructible, deteriorate before our very eyes. But this movie is not a cry-fest, but rather a celebration of what made The Who, well, The Who. There's many great live performances here, but the \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" finale is an emphatic exclamation point...if you've seen it, you know what I mean. Essential viewing, this movie belongs in any rock fans' collection.
B00005JN4O|2.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a slow, slow, languidly paced film about finding, not only Neverland but what Neverland represents:  the innocence and wonder of childhood before the cold cruel world rears its ugly head.<br /><br />In itself, this is a good subject for a film but did director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) have to the set the pace at simmer?<br /><br />At the center of this film is Johnny Depp's solid performance as James Barrie who wrote the stage play, \\"Peter Pan\\" and who \\"adopts\\" a widow (a radiant Kate Winslett) and her four boys as a way of filling in his own lonely life with the exuberance of children and childhood and as a way of making up for a loveless marriage.<br /><br />Depp never fails to do good work and he does so here once again. But it is all so deadly serious that whenever the two crumudgeons of this piece, Dustin Hoffman (Charles Frohman) and Julie Christie (Emma du Maurier) come onscreen they inject some much needed life into the proceedings with their wit and nasty dispositions.<br /><br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" never takes flight, as it should, being that it is based on the life of the man who invented Peter Pan but nonetheless it is a solid film, cast with solid actors, directed solidly by Forster. Unfortunately, it is also solidly clear that with all this talent involved: something, someone took the wrong turn and ended up, not in Neverland, but in Dullsville.
B000687M48|2.0|I love Evanescence, I saw that they had a new CD, I was dumb and rushed out to buy it. No new music, just live. Why didn't they put it on the front that it was live music, anything to try to make money off some duped fans! I am dissatisfied that I was not a more informed consumer. I really don't like the whole thing, more because it was not what I expected.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|Okay, now, in all fairness to this movie, I didn't watch the entire thing.  I couldn't.  I sat through the first several hours, and it was slow and tedious.  I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was no action whatsoever.  Five or six hours in, a pseudo-interesting thing happened involving a the cabin-boy, I think.  That kept me watching for a while longer.  But hour 10, I gave up.  I realized nothing exciting was ever going to happen; and I'd grown to loathe all of the characters.  I'd also grown a beard.  It was looong.    -Steve  Steve5805@yahoo.com    Edit: oh come on people, two people said this review wasn't helpful?  I dared to say what no one else would: that this movie is long.  And mundane.  And dull.  Well, I didn't say those other two things, but it was sort of implied.
B000001ESJ|4.0|A Farewell To Kings is Rush's followup to their landmark 2112 album and is arguably the dark horse of the band's catalog. Riding on the momentum of 2112, this album would be their first to reach the U.S. Top 40 and would yield their first top 100 single in \\"Closer To The Heart.\\" While this album is probably the least successful musically from their most fruiful period of 1976 to 1981, it still is a very strong album showcasing the band's improving songwriting skills and exceptional musicianship.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the most successful tracks here are the aforementioned \\"Closer To The Heart\\", one of the simplest songs they ever penned and the long epic \\"Xanadu\\" which is one of the best songs of the progressive era. A track with several movements and changes in momentum, it simply captures the listener and never grows old or stale. Geddy Lee's vocals show a maturity, changing tones throughout to reflect the mood of the track. \\"Cygnus X-1\\" is the second epic here and works nearly as well, concentrating more on heavier riffs and Neil Peart's frantic drumming than on \\"Xanadu.\\" The title track is  one of their most underrated tracks and spotlights Alex Lifeson whether it's his mellow classical guitar intro or wild electric soloing. \\"Cinderella Man\\" is one of their few tracks with lyrics penned by Lee and is pretty straight forward save for the solo. \\"Madrigal\\" is the obligatory mellow track carried by its whistling synth. All told, a very strong effort with the difference between this album and their best material (2112, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures) being that the lesser known tracks aren't as consistent as the rest of the album. However, it's still one of their better albums and definitely worth purchasing.
0897500482|5.0|Simplicty in thought and economy of motion - a radical concept for many even now more than 30 yrs after his death - this is the main thrust of this excellent compilation of philosophy, tactics, training of mind and body that makes Bruce Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do the bible for many martial artists.  <br />For the student of Philosophy, any sport and of life.  A classic and a must have.
B0006213WG|3.0|As many others have written, yes this cd shows they are very good musicians as far as playing technically and fast goes BUT!!!!!! the more i listen the more riffs from other bands i recognize. \\"We're all to blame\\" was the first song i heard and immediately said...this part sounds like a System of a Down song. Sure enough more songs had similar riffs. \\"I'm not the one\\" clearly rips off Linkin Park. And the biggest rip off is \\"the bitter end\\". MetallicA might as well be singing this song. If this isn't almost exactly like \\"Battery\\" I don't know what is. The solos sound just like the master Kirk Hammet, the chord progressions make me think I'm listening to Master of Puppets. I think Sum really has talent but they need a bit more originality when it comes to writing. If you are expecting the greatest cd ever you will truly be disappointed. If you are looking for a bunch of remixes and remakes of a previously released songs from other bands you should buy this.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Having really enjoyed the theatrical release of DareDevil, It took me only moments to decide I wanted to get the Director's Cut of the film. I enjoyed the dark theme of DareDevil, and the Director's Cut goes even darker by adding more violence and language. The violence tending to be new scenes and extentions to fights already in the movie. Important to note, perhaps, is that due to the addition of the new scenes, the story is done somewhat differently, though ultimatly leading up to the same conclusion. Example..(do not read next fews lines if you've yet to see DareDevil) when Matt and Elektra are talking on the rooftop, in the threatrical, Elecktra asks Matt to \\"stay with me\\", and so he does and it leads on into a romantic scene. However in the director's cut, Matt does indeed leave. Thusly, less romance. (end spoilers) That is perhaps not the best example of how the story changed, but how some scenes will have been changed. To conclude, I found the darker story of the Director's Cut to be better than the theatrical version and highly recommend anyone who enjoyed DareDevil to pick it up, and even people who have yet to see it.
B0000028MA|5.0|The soundtrack to the motion picture Singles takes you back to a time when the music scene was exciting. Musical tastes were finally moving away from the hair metal glitz that oversaturated the market and being replaced by the grunge movement. Tight leather pants and sappy power ballads were being replaced by flannel and good songs. The music presented here is among the best recorded in the early-90s as many of the bands here became superstars and gave rock music a much needed kick in the pants.<br /><br />The album starts out strong with Alice In Chains' \\"Would\\", a dark tale driven by its hypnotic bass line, and one of the best songs the band would produce.  Pearl Jam contribute the classic rock of \\"Breath\\", which has a long jam at the end similar to their first hit \\"Alive\\", and the raw rocker \\"State of Love and Trust.\\" The Smashing Pumpkins \\"Drown\\" is pure '90s psychedelia going from a quiet dreamy song before entering its long outro complete with feedback. Soundgarden's \\"Love Ritual\\" is very similar to the rage that comprised their Badmotorfinger album while the lesser known Mudhoney's \\"Overblown\\" is very sloppy and intense. The epic \\"Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns\\" by Mother Love Bone, who later spawned Pearl Jam, is another strong track. The Screaming Trees' \\"Nearly Lost You\\" should have been a hit single as this is the most radio-friendly of the grunge songs.<br /><br />But this isn't strictly a grunge album. Former Replacements leader Paul Westerberg's \\"Dyslexic Heart\\" and \\"Waiting for Somebody\\" are catchy well-written rock songs with memorable hooks, something you don't hear enough of today. The Lovemongers' version of \\"Battle of Evermore\\" is probably the best cover of a Led Zeppelin song and Ann and Nancy Wilson's vocals here are fantastic. Jimi Hendrix's \\"May This Be Love\\" is outstanding and the most mellow track here. However, the best song here is Chris Cornell's \\"Seasons.\\" Certainly a change of pace from anything he recorded with Soundgarden, \\"Seasons\\" showcases Cornell's excellent vocals which are more rooted in emotion rather than the intensity of his former band. All told, this album is a good representation of an exciting time in the music scene, when emphasis was placed more on good songs rather than image. It's certainly better than the majority of today's music receiving airplay which in many cases is just heavily advertised product.s\\" showcases Cornell's excellent vocals which are more rooted in emotion rather than the intensity of his former band.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|The genius of Ray Charles comes across in this recording, as he is able to pull-off pairings with one of the more eclectic groups of musicians to ever share a CD cover.   He hits all his genres, from brassy big band ditties to soulful, stripped down lyrical odes, in a CD that will at different times have people tapping their toes and drying their eyes. <br /> <br />That this is his last original release should not be forgotten.     With many songs recorded in the last days of his life, Ray Charles's failing health is painfully apparent in many of these tracks (most especially the duet with Willie Nelson).     <br /> <br />A testament to Charles is that each reviewer on this site seems to have different favorites.  I prefer his work with Diana Krall, Bonnie Raitt and the incomparable Norah Jones, but that's just one man's opinion.    <br />
B0002TT0NW|5.0|this buy far the best of the harry potter series. it has a new director, better acting, and a lot more conflict. as harry enters his next year of hogwarts, sirius black who killed 13 people with one curse escapes from azkaban the dreaded wizard prison. with him on the lose he head for hogwarts to kill harry. now i thought the director really got all the emotions out of the caracters, we got to see a more darker harry who wants to kill blakc for what he did to his parents. my favorite scene was the timeturner one, it conveyed stuff that was confuing to use about the scene but there was one thing i think the director could of done better. make the movie a lot longer, i mean a lot of scenes were cut out like we never got to see the championship macth, black beging in the room, and the owl post scene but all and all he managed to bring out the best movie in the series.
1592400876|5.0|This is a short humorous, essay on the art of proper punctuation!!!  It eloquently makes the case that to slight, proper puncutation is to embrace 'intellectual impoverishment\\".<br /><br />However, it's greatest value, lies in the practical.  Before reading it -- I was'nt sure how to use many punctuation marks; but now Im much improved'  In addition:  the book is delightfully engaging, and so will make a discussion of such \\"things\\" as the exclamation point; the comma; and the semicolon as engaging as they could possibly be (and this is no small achievement . . . After reading, it youl'l be unlikely to make embarrassing punctuation mistakes again?<br /><br />Seriously, I do have one gripe about this book.  Truss, the author, is British, and their punctuation system is often different from the one we use in the States.  The problem is, this book wasn't really edited (and certainly not re-written by Truss) for its American release, so many of the points she makes (e.g., about \\"U.K.\\" or \\"UK\\", or the varying uses of the  ' versus the \\") fall flat, as the rules she so humorously reminds us of are not the actual rules we use in the States.  And this is leaving aside the question of her terminology.<br /><br />But worth your while nonetheless.  Maybe the publishers will have enough sense to come out with an American edition someday.
B000002KEV|5.0|I feel compelled to review this record, in the hopes that I can express how much it means to me, and hopefully convince others to check it out.. <br /> <br />This was the second record I ever owned, the first being \\"Machine Head\\", which stands out as one of my all time favorite studio records. Deep Purple's lineup was absolutely top notch; all great musicians, all completely complimentary in style, coming together to make one unified, powerful greater whole. What could be greater than that album? <br /> <br />When I brought home Made in Japan, and listened to Highway Star, I was flat-out floored. This was true power; a band at its creative and performing zenith. The band was the song; it was a killin' machine, it had everything, I loved it, I needed it, it turned me on. For me, the very concept of rock and roll was given physical form by that recording. The energy, the interplay of the band, the awesome musical moments still amaze me, 33 years later.  <br /> <br />After this album, I judged every band by the quality of its live recordings. Few ever stood up to this effort, which took incredible raw material and somehow transformed it into near perfection.  <br /> <br />Highlights: Highway star (possibly the greatest live interpretation ever captured), Strange Kind of Woman (amazing dymnamics and a spectacular moment at the end when Ian Gillian screams solo, then sighs \\"Ooh my soul, I love you baby\\", and screams again, as the band careens into the ending), Lazy, the first part of Space Truckin' (prior to the extended jam - this is the only throwaway part of the record IMHO), Child in Time (an homage to their earliest recordings, and a Gillian showpiece). <br /> <br />After hearing what is posible in a live recording like this, its mind-boggling that people let their favorite musicians get away with pre recorded live pieces or lip-syncing. Few bands have the chops and unified sense of identity that are on display on this album. Buy it and enjoy!
B000255LIY|1.0|There are times in the world of movies when it seems that all logic evaporates.  A remake of THE LION IN WINTER, the 1968 masterpiece starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, is such time.  Nothing in this movie comes remotely close to the original.  In taking the role as Henry II, Patrick Stewart continues a line of miscasting messes that have included his trying and failing to best Gregory Peck's Ahab in a remake of MOBY DICK, and trying and failing to make a credible Ebenezer Scrooge while falling well short of George C. Scott's masterful portrayal in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.<br /><br />Glen Close is just awful! When compared to Katherine Hepburn, Close is like having a tuna sandwich when lobster is on the menu!<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally abysmal.  How do you replace Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton, John Castle and Jane Merrow?  You don't as evidenced by this film. How can you think that you can? That remains the mystery!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
0812550706|5.0|If you only read one science fiction book, this should be the one.  If you've read a million, this should be one.  This is Card's masterwork, a fast-paced, compelling story that sets the mark for all science fiction which follows.  As someone who has red science fiction and fantasy titles numbering literally in the thousands, I can recommend this one above almost all others.
0441172717|5.0|Dune may well be the finest piece of science fiction ever written.  I read it over twenty-five years ago and it still sticks in my mind as a great and memorable book, one with a language and a world of its own.  It is an awesome piece of imagination.  I had my wife (never a science fiction fan by any means) read it and she too was amazed by how intense a read it is.  You don't need to read the entire set, though.  The first book stands on its own as a complete and satisfying story.
0316666343|3.0|This book intrigued me in the book store, and I am really glad I picked it up. The story concept is truly different and compelling. A young girl is raped and murdered, but she is caught between heaven and earth with the ability to see what effect her death has upon everyone who knew her.  <br /> <br />The book is a tad bit long (at times I found myself wanting the author to simply \\"get to the point\\"!), and the language could be a bit more down to earth. However, all in all, this book is a nice diversion and truly gives the reader something to think about about regarding life, death, and the hereafter.

B00008WG3U|1.0|The below review should give you an idea of the typical fan of NOFX or punk rock for that matter.  I especially like he juvenile insults that he hurls towards other reviewers for no reason. This is especially significant since it shows how hypocritical the whole BS punk rock scene is.  They preach tolerance yet are completely unnaccepting of not only opposing viewpoints, but are angry that people could even be capable of having opinions that differ from their own.  It's also worthy to note that the typical liberal punk rocker used to talk about how Americans were being screwed since Bush apparently stole the election.  Once he is reelected and wins the popular vote I might add, these punk rockers talk trash about the American people and talk about how they ruined the country. <br /> <br />Whether you are liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, like Bush or not, it should be clear to anyone with half a brain that this anti-Bush rhetoric of Fat Mike and NOFX, as well as other Punk bands, is nothing more than a marketing ploy, and an extraordinarily successful one at that.  It's ludicrous that anyone would take the political opinions of a self proclaimed gambling alcoholic who glamorizes his idiotic, immature, and destructive behavior and who until recently was never politically minded as the gospel.  He also cheapens any legitimate criticism of Bush.  lIke, for example, the fact that he wants the American labor class to be made up of foreigners or the fact that the reason why the war on terror is so detrimental is that he has declared war on a tactic instead of a specific group of people such as the muslim arabs and the Saudis who funded 9/11.  This is like Winston Churchill declaring war on blitzkrieg. <br /> <br />The music is garbage.  It's catchy at times, but so is the jingle in the Captain Crunch cereal commercial. <br /> <br />Fat Mike is laughing all the way to the bank since he has made so much dough off of the ignorant youth of America who are isolatedin the wealthy suburbs of American and go the the festival of homosexuality that is the Warped Tour.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Well, I am sure that we have all heard the story of Cinderella many times over, but in Ever After we finally get to see a stronger female lead than those who dance through our little girls brains at an impressionable age.<br /><br />Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore) lives alone with her father and their servants after the death of her mother, until one day her father brings home a new bride, the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston) and her two daughters, Marguerite and Jacqueline.  When Danielle's father dies, the Baroness turns Danielle into a servant to wait on her and her spoiled daughters.<br /><br />Danielle accidently meets young Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) when the Prince pilfers a horse from their manor in order to escape his parents restrictions.  For her silence, he gives her coins, which she uses to pose as a courtier to buy back their old servant the Baroness sold to pay her taxes.<br /><br />She meets Prince Henry again, but this time posed as a Lady, and Henry finds himself enchanted not simply by her beauty but by her intelligence and spirit.  He becomes determined to know more about her, but first must find her for she keeps slipping away from him.  In the meantime, Marguerite has set her sights on the handsome prince, with the help of her mother and a michevious courtier.<br /><br />I won't give away any more of the movie, but absolutely must mention that there is a great deal of humor in this unique telling of the Cinderella story (take special note of the wedding chapel scene with the Spanish Princess).  The acting is supurb and the script very tight and well written, the costumes are stunning, the scenery is breathtaking, and the photography brilliant.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful movie that softened even my cold, hard heart, allowing it to pump warm blood if only for the length of the movie.  This is a love story without sappiness, a handsome hero with faults of his own, and a beautiful heroine who knows how to save herself.  Enjoy!

B0001YRVN4|3.0|For fans who enjoyed the original theater release of the Star Wars feature films, this box set may be disappointing. <br />1)re-edited films, I didn't expect this to be a repolished, updated version of the original. Some minor scenes and dialogue were cut, with new scenes and even new music added. Its simply not the same set of films that came out in the theater. Classics shouldn't be adjusted. Imagine a new and improved Casablanca! <br />2)Bulky, ugly box set. With all the bulk, I expected lots of DVDs. Not so, there's more plastic and cardboard than DVDs. <br />3)Much of the extra footage has been aired before. But there are some new things.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan. But, honestly, I think this set is too expensive for what you get. After waiting so long for the box set, I was disappointed with it.
0064407667|2.0|The first question that popped into my head was \\"Is Lemony Snicket a real name or a pseudonym?\\" The second was \\"How would she sustain the misfortunes and make it a believable story?\\" The first one is yet unanswered but the second became clear when I read \\"The Bad Beginning.\\" Without the series title and the warning blurb, this is just your run-of-the-mill children's book. It thrives on conflicts that are mandatory anyway in any fictional work, and pretends that this banality is what makes it unique. Finally, when things seem to have been resolved towards the end, the villain escapes. Did anybody say, \\"Scam\\"? It reads to me like the starting paragraph of the next book in the series. True enough, there have been at least ten books released. <br /> <br />I would recommend you wait for the movie. This concept may be more successful in the cinematic form, and it would be a chance to see Jim Carrey monkey up again. As for the book, well, it's well-bound, but only literally.
0060920084|3.0|Let me start by saying that shortly prior to 30 miles on the AT I read A Walk in the Woods and loved it.  Couldn't put it down and thought Bryson was not only funny but his book was chock full of tidbits of information that I still quote four years later.  I was hoping that Lost Continent would be a similar experience.  I was disappointed. <br /> <br />The problem with the book is really one of missed opportunity.  I don't think that he took the time that he should have.  I was amazed.  One foggy and snow bound day in Yellowstone.  A couple minutes in front of a giant sequoia with a crowd of people.  A review of Cleveland from a bridge as he blasted through.  He missed so many chances to be impressed, to see the things that make the US great.  At this point, most of us know that the typical American town is not really a notable experience.  We know there are too many strip malls and fast food joints.  Bill should have got that out of the way early and gotten on to the rest of what was out there. <br /> <br />The best parts of this book, for me, were his recollections of vacationing with his dad.  These vacations were the inspiration for the book and in the end BB does a great job making you see how nutty, but great his dad really was. <br /> <br />The rest of the book just sets him up to return to Iowa and realize that it is much better that he ever gave it credit for being.
B00005JKNC|3.0|I never thought I would see any Jim Carrey movie that I'd like or one I would sit through and finish. It happened just a couple of weeks ago with \\"The Majestic.\\" I never had the chance to like Carrey, having been introduced to him in the monkey movie, \\"Ace Ventura.\\" The faces he made in that and in subsequent movies did not in the least appeal to me. In fact, I never even went to see any of his movies in the cinema. Those of his that I've watched fleetingly, I only watched on TV, when there wasn't anything else on except \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Joe Millionaire\\" and it was too tiring to do anything else. <br /> <br />I'm a definite sucker for sob movies and \\"The Majestic\\" has more than its fair share of sob moments. But more than that, I think it was seeing Jim Carrey trying to look semi-serious (he is probably not capable of looking totally serious, except if he is shown lying face down) that got me glued to the TV. It seemed like he was playing his character tongue-in-cheek, which worked while he was assuming the character of the son (as I guess he was supposed to look somewhat lost doing so), but seemed like a bad parody before and after that (how do you look serious without making faces?). But having seen him do the monkey movies, I was amazed at his attempt at trying not to contort his face or open his mouth too wide. To me, his effort was well worth the failure - or it was probably the failure that highlighted the effort and made it even more admirable. I must admit, my regard for Jim Carrey has climbed up a bit after having seen him in this movie. <br /> <br />All the other actors appeared more at ease portraying their characters than Jim did. My favorite performance was that of Martin Landau's, very effortless and captivating. He could have lit up \\"The Majestic\\" (the movie as well as the theater in the film) all by himself. I also enjoyed watching Gerry Black, the actor who played the doorman - he was so serene and highly effective. <br /> <br />The overall conception of the movie was too melodramatic for my taste. The desire to gain sympathy was too obvious. There was a hurried feel to the movie; it felt like the filmmakers thought the middle parts had been dragging on too long and they couldn't wait for it to be over. But the ambience looked authentic and the casting was first-rate, especially the risk taken at having cast Jim Carrey when they could have easily picked Tom Cruise and messed around with his signature look - the I'm-a-movie-star-don't-mess-with-me look that the public laps up at (which to me is reminiscent of Ben Stiller's supposed unique look in Zoolander - it doesn't change no matter what it's called, but that's another topic altogether).
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I wish there would be ten stars (*), not just five, for this material. <br /> <br />I share all the good opinions and feelings of so much sensitive people reviewing this concert, however I would like to give twenty stars, in person, to the beautiful and powerful woman who sang the only female solo in this concert, her name is Sam Brown, daughter of Joe Brown, as quoted another reviewer, and, unfortunately, she is in love (or was at the moment) with the great musician Jools Holland. I envy him for this.  <br /> <br />I respect him a lot as a musician (he performs in another outstanding material, the documentary about the legendary Memphis' Sun Records label), but more than that because the woman is on his side.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This album is very, very good. They have a similar sound to Modest Mouse, The Shins, Air and that stuff. Its good.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|In its own way this movie is quite amazing, when i saw the first trailor for this movie it was an immediate must see for me, especially with Trey Parker and Matt Stone behind the whole thing (creators of southpark) and doing most of the voices. From the very start of this movie it had the audience errupting with laughter. Starts of in the usual action genre way, the terrorists try to blow up a city in France but are stopped by the good guys 'Team America World Police'. The first scene is quite perfect it lets you know what to expect later in the film, immediately launches into a bloody affair with a lot of humour, no man alive could leave their seat after that one unless you were deeply offended.<br /><br />This movie is deffinately not for the weak stomach, shows a lot of rather desgusting scenes some maybe a little over the top but they are hilarious including some very wild sex scenes. They have done a great job with the puppet work but didn't try to make it to detailed in several scenes they made the walking or pointing look dodgy but on purpose, the movie wouldn't be the same without them.<br /><br />I have seen a few other puppet based movies, all were extremely crap quite boring with no humour, I knew that Team America was not going to be alike right from the time i saw the trailor. The movie includes good explosions some cool sets in which they placed the puppets and maybe a little too detailed blood scenes which didn't bother me but could well bother some others.<br /><br />The movie is very offensive to quite a lot of people includes a lot of recognised people including Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, Sharon stone, Matt damon and leader kim jong I1. The movie greatly makes fun of the actors movie guild calling the guild f.a.g and most of the recognised people who like to work against America.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious films of our time if you dont like south park you might not want to watch this, a deffinate no-no for any children the movie will ruin there minds, but if you are in for a real laugh go and give the movie a go.will ruin there minds, but if you are in for a real laugh go and give the movie a go.
B000089CJI|5.0|This album is very unique. Postal service has a similar sound to ModestMouse, Airand the shins  and that stuff, its very good. A must buy
B000005S0E|4.0|I love this album. It's full with different beats, very dreamy at sometimes (dressing up), very cute (birdmad girl, the caterpillar, piggy in the mirror) very up beat (shake dog shake, give me it), very good instruments (birdmad girl, wailing wall especially) The empty world is an ok song, the only track on here skipable. All in all I would give it ***`, one of my favorite Cure albums!!! Goes great with Wild Mood Swings :)
B0006213WG|3.0|Im not very impressed with the latest relase by Sum 41. I loved All Killer No Filler, but this is very different. I like a few tracks like \\"Some Say\\" and \\"Were all to blame\\", but this isnt as good as the other Sum 41 albums. I would suggest getting it, but you wont listen to it that much.
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you were to look up some of the most hysterical moments on the BBC, you would no doubtably come across two names.  Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais.  While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called \\"The Office\\", Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades.  While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent.  One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called \\"Fawlty Towers\\".<br /><br />Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago.  Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all.  So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing.  If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does.  Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time.  Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully \\"Fawlty Towers\\" is all of these and many more.<br /><br />Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&B that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything.  With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel).  Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&B.  This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.<br /><br />This series, again, is hysterical.  Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him.  While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say \\"hogwash\\" to that.  My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel.  The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today.  All I need to say is thank God for the BBC.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****nd in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily. <br /> <br />This series, again, is hysterical.

B0002TT0NW|2.0|Overall, I was seriously disappointed with this film compared to the first two.  Director Chris Columbus seemed to have a better handled on the story-line & the way the story should be layed out than Director Alfonso Cuaron.  In my opinion, Cuaron should have read the books rather than \\"fly by the seat of his pants\\".  The story line in the 3rd film was a bit dismal and sketchy to follow.  Overall it seemed as though the audience was thrown into scenes rather than have the scenes properly explained.  For instance, when 'The Fat Lady's' picture was slashed, the movie never explained why she was slashed up to bits.  Why Sirius Black wanted to get into the Griffindor Tower.  When Aunt Marge was ballooned out, she never floated outside.  Or in Lupin's class, Harry never faced the boggart with the rest of the class, Lupin's fear was that Harry's worst fear would've been Voldemort & didn't want to spread panic throughout the rest of the room. <br />Disappointing job Director, absoluting disappointing.  I hope the rest of the movies aren't filmed in the same disarraying pattern.
0385508417|4.0|This book proves, once more, what a writer Mr Grisham is. Far away from the lawyer thing, this book is a very curious and funny side of the impossibility of simply changing plans when this concerns to the familiar and the community life. Incredibly wrong about the possibility of skipping the Christmas \\"obligations\\" the Krank's family provides us with a hilarious adventure.
B000022TSH|5.0|Jack Nicholson is totally captivating in his role as a private detective who specializes in tracking down stray spouses. But his latest case leads him to uncover greed and corruption that involve men in the highest levels of government, along with the wife and daughter (Faye Dunaway) of two such men, who also struggles to keep her terrible secret from coming to light. <br /> <br />Chinatown does such a fantastic job of capturing the mood and feel of the pre-World War II era that it actually seems like the film had to have been made back then. You may think it's a bit slow in the beginning, but rest assured that every little detail is significant to the story, which ultimately builds to an unforgettable climax. This critically acclaimed film is deserving of every accolade that has been bestowed upon it. <br /> <br />PS - for a great double feature, watch Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest back to back !
B00005JNBQ|5.0|For the past few years there has been a movement in American film you could call \\"The New Mormon Cinema.\\"  Young Latter-day Saint filmmakers (definitely inspired by the Sundance Film Festival which is held right in their own backyard) have been making inexpensive independent films that are targeted at the Mormon population that stretches in the west from Alberta in Canada down past the Mexican border (the so-called \\"Mormon Corridor.\\")  Most of these movies have been really bad, cheaply done sit-com influenced \\"comedies\\" that have had absolutely no influence on non-Mormon audiences.  (With the honorable exeception of Richard Dutcher, the director of good movies like the missionary drama \\"God's Army\\" and the thriller \\"Brigham City.\\")  Things began to change this year with widespread recognition going to the tough-minded World War II drama \\"Saints and Soldiers\\" and this twisted little comic  masterpiece, \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\"<br /><br />Jared and Jerusha Hess are products of Brigham Young University's film school and they made ND with a bunch of their friends.  The unspoken assumption of this film is that most of the kids are Mormons.  Some critics who misunderstood the movie as \\"condescending\\" have no experience with real people like these.  I live in rural Utah and I can testify that Hess is only mildly exaggerating.  The critics somehow miss the love with which the characters are drawn, just as some Minnesotans weren't too thrilled with the Coen brothers' \\"Fargo.\\"  Napoleon's pathetic older brother Kip has been singled out as particularly unbelievable.  But believe me, Kips are a dime a dozen in Idaho (and Utah, too.)<br /><br />Napoleon himself is not so much acted as incarnated by Jon Heder, who would win some sort of Oscar if people could only see he was playing a role, not living it.  Napoleon is the real nerd deal, not some idealized John-Hughes-style Hollywood version.  You really feel the anguish of his life, even as it provokes guilty belly laughs.  The genius of the movie is how the Hesses take the angst of Todd Solondz (\\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\" and \\"Happiness\\") and put their triumphantly uniquely Mormon spin on it.<br /><br />Hess is the second Mormon director, after Neil LaBute in \\"The Shape of Things\\", to make reference to singer Elvis Costello (\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is one of Costello's aliases.)  The movie Napoleon is as physically unprepossessing as Costello is, until he starts to sing.  You see, Mormons are always worrying about what other people think of them, because of their long-time outsider status in American society.  This overwhelming self-consciousness can make them feel as awkward and crushed by the culture as Napoleon is.  But inside they just know they are as dynamic as the very name \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\"  The opportunity awaits for them to strut their true stuff.  An individual like Napoleon can't be destroyed if he doesn't want to be.  There's something eternal in him that will win out.  The importance of this thought is why the Hesses avoid the very appearance of sentimentality in their presentation of Napoleon.  You have to learn to love him in spite of his monstrous imperfections, because he is human.  And you rejoice in Napoleon's final dance, which is five or six of the most joyous minutes in a movie this year.<br /><br />It's also important that Kip and Napoleon redeem themselves by reaching out to others not like them.  Kip hilariously to La Fawnduh, and Napoleon to Pedro and Deb.  The Hesses are brave enough to make sympathetic jokes about multiculturalism here.  Certainly, Preston Idaho, won't save them; but maybe Detroit and Mexico will.  I left \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" with genuinely earned good feelings about humanity in general and the future of Mormon movies in particular.enius of the movie is how the Hesses take the angst of Todd Solondz (\\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\" and \\"Happiness\\") and put their triumphantly uniquely Mormon spin on it. <br /> <br />Hess is the second Mormon director, after Neil LaBute in \\"The Shape of Things\\", to make reference to singer Elvis Costello (\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is one of Costello's aliases.)

6305308659|3.0|This was somewhat interesting but I think the whole story wouldve been better had diffrent actors played the roles of David and Jennifer. The main menu seemed cool and it seemed like it would be a good film, the first 30 min were somewhat interesting but I did not like the characters, they didnt interest me or i couldnt relate to them or picture those actors in that role, frankly they didnt do a good job. I loved reese witherspoon in other roles but this one i hated. Im not going to get into the whole story because it contains some deep messages and its strange, i LIKE strange but this film was not entertaining , IT WAS BORING AFTER the first 40 min and it was long. I love deep meaningful films with messages but this just didnt do it for me, that whole black and white into color. The color was interesting but the story lacked. Just wasnt my cup of tea, If youre into boring films and 50s stuff you might like this, only reason id recomend this film is to see the visual stuff, its innovative, other than that skip this.
B00005JNEI|1.0|While I can tolerate that Michael Moore has to right to express his opinion, I find it incredibly unethical for him to call this film a documentary.  A documentary is typically made to be as objective as possible.  In particular, you would not find many honest filmmakers intentionally including misleading films clips in a documentary.  The only thing Moore documents is how fanatical he and others are with their hatred of Bush and his administration.  Their treatment of this medium says more about them than it does about the president.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Altman has made a film which appeals on at least two quite different levels.  For those who enjoy sophisticated social comedy with a nice mystery plot--folks who enjoy Agatha Christie--this is a winner.  The film can certainly entertain one on these grounds alone.  It is sumptuous and beautiful to look at, and the characters are complicated in some cases, and hold one's interest even when they are \\"types\\" because of the acidulous dialogue.   <br />   However, more challengingly, there is certainly a historical-social context which Altman has more than suggested.  The only historical character is Ivor Novello, who was a gay actor-songwriter of the 20s and 30s, and it is significant that he brings a fictional gay film director, jewish and gay, to the party.  These socially marginal characters, who are tolerated by the gentile aristocrats, are the moral center of the film.  They--that is, --and the servants downstairs, whose life is a wretched inverted mirror-image of the hideous stratified social ziggurat we find upstairs.   <br />  Consider that Altman gives a precise date for the action:  November, 1934.  The Nazis had just won their first big election in Germany, and the British Union of Fascists, under Sir Oswald Moseley had just pulled off their first big rally in London.  Hmmm.  Could the temporal setting be merely accidental?
B000008JUM|4.0|I have been listening to this album for 14 years now and it has aged well.  While there are a couple of songs I routinely skip (neneh cherry and debbie harry with iggy pop), it is one CD that I find myself coming back to over and over.  The majority of the videos that were created for these songs carried an AIDS theme that the songs could not.  For those that think kd lang's version of \\"so in love\\" is haunting, should see the video that was produced to go along with it, heartbreaking is the word.  les negresses vertes eccentric version of \\"i love paris\\" is great and the memory of the video only makes it better.  The women seem to play it closer to the original and some of the most memorable songs come from sinead o connor, annie lennox, kd lang, lisa stansfield and jody watley.  I love the neville brothers version of \\"in the still of the night\\" and u2's \\"night and day\\" and everytime that the drums start on david byrne's \\"don't fence me in\\", I turn it up until the windows shake.  The video for \\"don't fence me in\\" is also one of the better ones.  As a bonus, the CD comes with the lyrics as originally written by Cole Porter, so that you can compare them to how the artists interpreted them for their songs.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.
0688078958|4.0|\\"More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it seems, try to,\\" says Bill Bryson in the first sentence of his book The Mother Tongue: English and How it Got that Way. This may not be that surprising of a fact unless you know that English was once considered an unworthy common tongue of peasants.   In his book, Bryson follows the journey of the English language over the centuries.  His text is sprinkled with humor and packed with eye-popping facts that are enough to get any English major bouncing with excitement. <br /> <br />   Bryson praises English for its abundance of descriptive words and synonyms but is quick to admit that it makes little sense, \\"any language where the unassuming word fly signifies an annoying insect, a means of travel, and a critical part of a gentleman's apparel is clearly asking to be mangled,\\" and he sets out to make sense of a senseless language. <br /> <br />   He examines why four has a \\"u\\" while forty doesn't, and why we pronounce colonel with and \\"r\\" when it very obviously lacks one.  From silent letters to crazy spellings, everything is covered. <br /> <br />   English finally makes sense.
B00005U122|5.0|I absolutely love this concert.  I saw Roger Waters in Florida on the 2000 leg of his In The Flesh tour and it changed my life.  So I was very happy to finally get this DVD.  I also have the CD of this show and I play it in my car constantly.   <br />Waters looked great and was in a great mood during this show and he certainly didn't disappoint.   <br />The show begins, ofcourse, with : <br /> <br />In The Flesh - I remember when I saw this show in West Palm how surprised I was when Roger starting singing this song, because I very much expected the show to start with the first half of the song - In The Flesh?  Starting the show with the second half of the song - In The Flesh (without question mark) was truly inventive. <br />The Happiest Days of Our Lives - I'm so glad he decided to do this little bit, complete with helicopter sound before marching into <br />Another Brick In The Wall (part 2) - an extended version of this song, feauturing two seperate solos by two seperate guitarists. <br />Mother - I had longed to hear this song performed live, and Roger did it beautifully, with some lovely female vocals on the Gilmore parts. <br />Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert - When I first saw the show..I had never heard this song before and was not familiar with the Final Cut album. <br />Southhampton Dock - better than the original studio recording. <br />Pigs on the Wing (part 1) - I was not familiar with the Animals album either, but it later became one of my favorites. <br />Dogs - All eighteen minutes of it!  Great! <br />Welcome to the Machine - A new updated version of this song with the entire band instead of just acoustic, twelve string  guitar as on the Wish You Were Here CD. <br />Wish You Were Here - with Roger on vocals!  Though he sounds nothing like Dave Gilmore, it was really cool to see the artist perform his own song. <br />Shine On You Crazy Diamond (parts 1 and 2) - putting both parts together to form one long song, with the really cool instrumental placed in the middle. <br />Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun - From A Saucer Full of Secrets.  Awesome updated version of the song with the full band. <br />Breathe - Starting off the second set of the show with the legendary heart-beat of Dark Side of the Moon.  Doyle Bramhall II on vocals. <br />Time - With Roger on vocals.  I think he did a phenomenal job. <br />Money - With Doyle Bramhall II on vocals again.  Waters has said that this was his favorite song to perform on this tour. <br />The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (part 11 aka Every Strangers' Eyes) - Beautifully done.  Showing off the full range of Water's abilities. <br />Perfect Sense (part 2) - Better than the original studio recording.  P.P. Arnold does a wonderful job on the female vocals.  On this song, Roger decides to put down his bass and let Andy Fairweather Low play for a while.  This song was staged wonderfully and gave Roger a chance to get out in the light, up close and personal with the audience. <br />The Bravery of Being Out of Range - I've always liked this song.  Singing about war as Roger oftens does, he tells the story as if he were actually there. <br />It's a Miracle - Sounded very similar to the studio recording.  Once more, without a guitar, Roger picks up a mike and tells the story of this song as he walks about the stage. <br />Amused to Death - Extremely moving performance of this song. <br />Eclipse - It was nice to hear this song.  After he didn't do it at the beginning of the set, I really didn't expect to hear it.  It was a pleasant surprise. <br />Comfortably Numb - this was really the song I had been waiting for all evening.  Roger delivered it wonderfully, playing rhythm guitar instead of bass, once again letting Andy Fairweather Low have it.  Doyle Bramhall II sings the Gilmore parts and he and Snowy White share the guitar solos. <br />Each Small Candle - Roger closes the show with a new song.  It's since been recorded but not yet released.  It tells the story ofthe crisis in Albania under the moron Vladmir Putin. <br />All in all, this is a wonderful concert and is ideal for any Waters fan or Pink Floyd fan.  You will be suprised at how much Roger Waters stays true to the old Pink Floyd flavor.  It was a great night seeing this show live at the Mars Music Ampitheatre in West Palm, and even better being able to relive it over and over again through this DVD. <br />
B00005JLSE|5.0|... but the movie itself is wonderful.  An adaption of a the Broadway musical, director Rob Marshall blends together the straightforward adaptions of old, with the surreal, in-your-face production of Moulin Rouge!  The result is amazing.  The \\"dream sequence\\" technique allows the narrative to take place in real life yet still allow for exciting music numbers. <br /> <br />The performances are similarly wonderful.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah, and even Richard Gere all sing and dance wonderfully.  It's great to see actors who don't normally sing and dance be pushed to the edge of their talents.  While there could have been a few improvements, it was overall a great production.  Add that with Bill Fosse's old wonderful coreography and some excellent and creative set design, and Chicago makes a great movie. <br /> <br />But a not so great DVD.  While Marshall and writer Bill Condon have a great commentary, and the deleted song Class is interesting, I wish there could have been more.  Moulin Rouge got a great DVD treatment - I'm upset this didn't either.  Still, Chicago is a wonderful movie that every musical lover should own.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is certainly not my favourite album, but it's one of the albums I play the most. It's easy listening and beautiful. I may not be very hard songs to play, but not because most song are simple doesn't mean they're bad. Not at all. Although the first couple of times I listen to it, it was hard to listen all songs till the end and nearly every song got boring. But i grew quickly on me and I saw the beauty of the album. Politik -one of my favourites - starts the album very bombastic, but it ends up as a beautiful song. In My Place is a little to simple for my taste, but it's certainly not a bad song. God Put A Smile Upon Your Face -another favourite- is a little less catchy, and you may not like it the first couple of times, but it's really great. If anybody doesn't like The Scientist, I wonder why that person even bought this CD, this is certainly a stand out even for the non-fans. The song is magnificent, just as the clip for the song (one of the best clips I've ever seen). Everybody likes Clocks, isn't it? Fans and non-fans. This is probably the biggest reason why you concider buying this CD. Although it's not one of my favourites, it can certainly be concidered as the most popular Coldplay-song. Daylight and Green Eyes are both good songs, but not as great as the rest of the CD, but not bad at all, I certainly don't skip these songs. Warning Sing - my favourite Coldplay-song ever- is maybe not the most stunning song on the album, but you've got to see the beauty of the song, this song hides itself behind songs as The Scientist and Clocks and that's why most people never pay enough attention to the song, and that's maybe why most people don't concider Warning Sign as a stand out. Even more people concider A Whisper as the worst song on the album, but I honestly don't know why. It's a little different then the rest of the album, but that's what makes me like it. A Rush Of Blood Through The Head, the titletrack, may not be the best song on the album, far from, butit's still great. Amsterdam is beautiful and is an excellent closer of the album. This is an-all-time-CD that is certainly worth buying.
0671015206|4.0|A.  The Millionaire Next Door is a book about the lifestyles and habits of America's wealthy.  This book takes an objective look at the America's so-called \\"millionaires\\".  Many people in America may live lifestyles like one would expect a millionaire to live according to American society, however, if you were to calculate those same people's net worth you would probably find that most are not millionaires and not all that wealthy.  Many high income earning Americans are so caught up with trying to keep up with the Jones' that they are spending the majority of their money as they get it thus reducing their wealth.  The authors of this book have come up with a good formula for calculating your expected net worth.  It is simply \\"Multiply your age times your realized pretax annual household income from all sources except inheritances. Divide by ten.  This, less any inherited wealth, is what your net worth should be.\\" <br /> The Millionaire Next Door classifies people into two categories, Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAW's) and Under Accumulators of Wealth (UAW's).  According to the book, most UAW's tend to spend frivolously and have no real regard for saving or investing.  PAW's on the other hand are known to be extremely frugal thus always building their net worth.  This concept can be related to business with the example of the ENRON Corporation.  While Enron may have been doing it for other reasons than \\"keeping up with the Jones'\\", they were altering their financial statements to make their company look more profitable than it actually was.  The same can be said for the executive who earns a decent six figure salary, has a five imported luxury automobiles, lives in an upscale neighborhood, owns a lake house with two boats, and belongs to at least one country club.  While to the outside observer, this executive may look very wealthy but if you were to actually calculate his net worth, chances are he would definitely fall into the UAW category because rather than investing a large portion of his annual six figure salary, he's probably spending most of it on monthly payments to finance all of his assets that make him look wealthy.  To the outside observer, Enron probably looked like a very appealing investment opportunity, however, take a close look at the day to day operations of the Enron accounting office and you might find that it is nothing but a bunch of smoke and mirrors to make the company look better, much like the tangible assets of the executive.   <br /> Another concept that I think is closely related to business is the concept of EOC otherwise known as \\"Economic Outpatient Care\\".  Stanley and Danko refer to EOC as more less subsidies paid by the wealthy to parents to their grown children.  EOC can range from payment of a grandchild's private school tuition to financial gifts of cash or stock.  This EOC can have a significant impact on the children of the wealthy.  While it may seem that this EOC will benefit them economically, the book suggests that it hinders the children economically in the long run because they become dependent on EOC payments from their parents thus they become used to living beyond their means.  While I've never claimed to be an economist, the same principle can be applied to industries and businesses who receive government subsidies on a regular basis. <br /> <br />B.  The Millionaire Next Door is a very enlightening book about the lifestyles and spending habits of America's wealthy.  The book is packed full of useful information for those who want to someday become wealthy and financially independent.  As a young person about to enter the so-called \\"real world\\" I feel that this book has given me some very valuable tips on becoming wealthy and the type of lifestyle one must lead in order to accumulate wealth.  Due to my young age I feel that I will be at a huge advantage to apply these principles and ideas to hopefully someday become wealthy myself.  One particular useful bit of information that I will be remembering not only in the near future but for several years is the advice that you should not buy a house valued at more than twice your annual household income.  After recently witnessing a close friend and his wife nearly lose their house to foreclosure because they bought a home above their means, this advice really hit home for me. <br /> <br />C.  While the book is informative and contains useful information, I sometimes found the book to somewhat boring.  I think that this may be due to the subject matter of the book being of different interest than what I would typically read.  The first chapter regarding the ancestry groups of millionaires can be summed up in one word: snore.  I also thought that the authors tried to imply that in order to become wealthy you must be an entrepreneur and start your own business.  While you may be much more likely to accumulate wealth this way, I definitely do not think that it is the one single way.   <br /> <br />D.  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to someday become wealthy and not have to worry about their financial situation in the event they lose their job or some other event.  I especially think that this book is more valuable to young people just starting out in life than would be to someone who is about to retire simply because it would be easier to change their ways if need be and they would have longer to apply the principles discussed in the book.  However, regardless of age I think that The Millionaire Next Door is a book that anyone can learn a thing or two from. <br />
B000003TSP|5.0|I've been listening to this a lot lately.  I reviewed \\"Dummy\\" recently and I have to say that I like \\"Portishead\\" just as much, but not better.  The song \\"Half Day Closing\\" is worth it for that alone.  And did you notice the guy counting off the measures once the drums kick in?  BRILLIANT.  Portishead only put out two albums, but at least they are both awesome, instead of putting out two masterpieces and then ruining their legacy with crap like most bands today.  LISTEN TO ME, DAMN IT!

While most marketing executives can come up with some great ideas from time to time, there always seems to be some sort of catch to them or they wind up doing something to hurt that brilliant idea without even knowing it.  Ries and Trout have come up with what is known as The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing.  The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing are designed to help marketers keep from making those fatal mistakes that turn great ideas into marketing disasters.   <br /> The format of The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is laid out in such a manner that each chapter covers one of the 22 immutable laws of marketing.  The laws range in subject matter from the introduction of new products, how to maintain market position, how to gain market position, how to combat marketing strategies of your competition, to how to stay at the top once you reach your maximum marketing potential for your company.  The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing has successfully accomplished to present one big general idea in twenty two different ways thus making the book very informative and useful to any marketer at any level in any company. <br /> <br />B. Aside from the overall great information and insight provided by the book, there were many great points and ideas that were referred to that I found to be particularly interesting.  One such idea was the seventh immutable law of marketing entitled \\"The Law of the Ladder\\".  \\"The Law of the Ladder\\" suggests that in every market there is a number one, number two, number three, and so on companies in the market.   These number one, two, and three companies are referred to as \\"rungs\\" on the ladder.  The law of the Ladder suggests that the best way to market your company if you are currently occupying the second rung on the ladder is to admit your position of being number two and use that to your advantage rather than trying to chase after the company currently occupying the top rung.  This law is risky because it requires you to completely expose your company and admit your weakness to the company currently ahead of you on \\"the ladder\\".  This law works because it relates your company to the number one company in the field by admitting that your company is not number one, but second to the top company in the industry.   <br /> The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing makes for good reading because it is not only informative with the material addressed, but Ries and Trout have written the book in such a manner that even the most novice of marketers can relate to.  Ries and Trout have also done a good job of making the book easy to relate to by lots of referrals to examples of large, well-known corporations that are still in business today.  This book was also written in such a manner that you can pick it up for five minutes and read a little at a time and everything still makes sense. <br /> <br />C. The only weaknesses of the book that I personally can think of would be that the examples used seemed to focus on three main industries.  Those industries are beer or alcoholic beverages, car manufacturing, and computer technology.  It would have been nice to occasionally hear about some other industries other than these three.   <br /> <br />D. As a fellow marketer I would definitely recommend you take the time to read this book.  It isn't very long in length and is fairly easy to read yet very informative to the seasoned marketing executive or the college undergraduate with an interest in marketing.  The value of the content contained in the book far outweighs the small sacrifice of time it takes to read. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|I feel bad for anyone who gave this record anything less than five stars, I would hate to experience music through your ears and mind.  In fact, this cd should have the exception of being able to rate it at 10 stars, and no other options.  It simply is just that good.  Radiohead and OK Computer single handedly made me lose interest in metal for a couple of years, but, that was like taking CRACK away from a junkie, and I am full blown back into metal again.  AMEN!
B0006284JQ|3.0|Why would anyone, anywhere, cover a Bobby Brown song and then use the title of that song as the title of their 'greatest hits' CD? How many of these songs were even hits anyway? And what is with that cover? Yes Britney needs her image and The Corporation realizes that a sexy/sleazy cover photo will get a few more sales.<br /><br />Britney started off as another pop star, made it too big, then became a joke. I'm sure her record company is writing her off and want one last trip to the well. Might as well squeeze their golden goose one more time before she's a total washout. 'Greatest Hits' CDs are released for two purposes, to make money for the Corporation and to release an artist from their contracts. Guess they figure an aging, married pop icon is ready for pasture.<br /><br />But don't worry, I'm sure we'll all see Britney from time to time on VH1's \\"Where are they Now?\\"
078681859X|3.0|\\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" is a magical adventure with two main characters: Nathaniel, a wizard-in-training, and Bartimaeus, the djinn he summons to assist him. If you know your fantasy there's nothing particularly original in the plot or setting, but it is a good, enjoyable read. <br />I fear the series is going to go down the \\"plucky children save the world\\" route, but this first book at least has a good adventure that does not stretch credibility too far and has an effective balance between drama, humour and tension. One of the most effective elements is Stroud's characterisation of Nathaniel. He might not be the world's most loveable boy, but what else can you expect of someone who's been brought up to believe in his own superiority, but at the same time has been abandoned and abused by those who should have protected him? He's power-hungry, yes; but what else has he ever been exposed to that he could choose to pursue instead to fill the void he doesn't recognise in himself? <br />I think Stroud could have done a bit more to research magic and djinni and the like to make his magic system a bit more solid and credible, and the next books will need a bit more warmth and cheer to keep my interest up.  <br />If you enjoyed \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\", you may also enjoy books by Terry Pratchett, Diana Wynn Jones (particularly the \\"Chrestomanci\\" series), and Catherine Webb (\\"Waywalkers\\" and \\"Timekeepers\\").
0345457684|1.0|What ever happened to good old fashion SciFi?   After reading the reviews I wanted to like this book.  I wanted to read a cool novel with new futuristic ideas.   This wasn't it.  After about 100 pages I couldn't even read it anymore.    The writing was poor and disjointed and the story is totally uninteresting.    I would never guess that someone could make sci fi this boring and take any kind of wonder out of it.    After the main character has sex which is described in graphic details like a 13 year old writing to Penthouse, I pretty much gave up.     If you are looking for a better written, more interesting novel on having disposable bodies then read the Kiln People by David Brin instead.

B00005ASOI|5.0|Argento's best known film is probably his most expressive. This is a gem to look at with all it's lush Italian colors seeping out like a blood covered canvas. If you are looking for a horror film for intellectuals, this isn't it, but if you want something that will definitely impress you, you've found it. It concerns an old dance company in Freiburg Germany that is headed up by an old witch matriarch who leads the coven in diabolical methods. An unsuspecting student, played wonderfully by Jessica Harper, finds herself piecing together a mystery when she arrives at the school in one of the most enigmatic and beautiful commencements of a film to date. Argento has music, colors, and sounds reverberate like an opera for our eyes to dazzle. He scares us with the rain, the closing of an automatic airport door, and loose tree branches that resemble evil lurking beings. This is one powerful moment. From then on, subtle hints are explored, the supernatural, science, one's faith. Never can we guess what is truly hiding at the academy. One scene of the dance students in the hall is superbly done with loud music, hideous heckling demonic shrieks and strange appearances, this is fantastic eye candy!

The things Slipknot fans say never cease to amaze me. If you want a halfway decent numetal band, check out Mudvayne or Nothingface. If you really want \\"heavy as hell death metal\\" check out Kataklysm, Nile or Cryptopsy. You little hot topic kids are such morons.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Miyazaki Hayao has devoted virtually his whole career--and every one of his master works--to encouraging the self-esteem of young girls everywhere through role models in his characters. Never has there been a more tireless champion of the ability, strength, and courage of women. If that was all he did, whether his work was successful or not, he'd be my hero. But as it turns out, his work is brilliant. Buy this DVD and all the rest. If you kow a young girl between the ages of 8 and 18, that dangerous time when young girls can so easily lose hope, buy them \\"Kiki's Delivery Service,\\" and this one.

B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver-1966 <br />When trying to pick the greatest Beatles album, it really comes down to a matter of opinion.  However, Revolver should definitely be in the top 3, not just for the Beatles, but for any entire rock collection.  This album was a huge stepping-stone for the Beatles and rock n roll.  Revolver marks the second album that the Beatles had begun doing new things on that they couldn't reproduce on stage (a big reason they stopped touring).  Though they would soon have more musical ambitions, Revolver was the newest and most innovative thing the Beatles had done up to this point. <br /> <br />It is not a hidden fact that Revolver was greatly influenced by the drugs the Beatles were taking at this time, most notably Lsd, and it definitely shows. The drug influences are most clear and obvious in John's songs, mainly \\"She Said, She Said\\", and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", and these are actually some of the standout tracks on the album(look what those devil drugs have done!). Yet, let us not forget Paul as he, in some people's opinions, has the best songs on Revolver.  It is easy to see why this might be.  He writes the famous \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the softer songs on the album \\"For No one\\" and \\"Here There and everywhere\\". George also shows some great songwriting in \\"Taxman\\" while Ringo still had yet to write his own song but does sing \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (probably the worst song on this album).  However, this does nothing to bring it down and it is easy to tell why it gets such great praise.  Let me just say that it lives up to its name as one of the greatest albums of all time and if you don't have Revolver you have no music collection.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|This movie was the best of the series to this point. Having said that it is still flawed in ways that it should not be. I must admit before I go into detail that I have read this book at least twice, so I know this plot fairly well.  <br /> <br />This movie begins with Harry working on spells under his covers. Then his Aunt Marjorie comes over, who believes that she should belittle him every moment he is around. It gets to the point where Harry blows her up into what is essentially a giant balloon. He then runs away from home and a bus picks him up, called the Knight Bus. It is a wizarding bus that takes lost wizards to where they must go. Harry goes to Diagon Alley, to get his books and things for school. Then he is told by Ron's father that he is being hunted by a murderer that broke out of the prison of Azkaban, the prison no one has ever escaped. That is where this story begins. <br /> <br />This is the first Harry Potter movie that, in my mind, is a good movie. The acting was by far best in this one, with excellent performances by Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney, David Thewlis as Professor Lupin, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Also the new actor for Headmaster Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, does a good job. The new director Alfonso Cuaron does an admirable job trying to bring this story to life, but I think he could have done a better job sticking with the books story-line instead of one just based on the books.
0375703764|4.0|this book is an instant page turner. after the first 50 or so pages, I became hooked and pulled by the book's stong gravitational pull. This novel will keep you reading with its bizzare plot and figurative language.  <br /> <br />the set up of this book is very unique also. it constantly flashes back between two views. The life of johnny truant, and a novel Inside this novel. great book for people who read David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. Highly Recommended&#62;
B00030590I|5.0|This movie was excellent from start to finish. It is a show of great cinematography and visual effects. Although the effects are a little crazy after a little while, it is stilll an excellent movie. It shows what a true hero to Chinese culture. The only flaw I thought that there was in this movie would be its ending. Its ending gives off a great message but still does not entirely make sense, even in a movie that if you are to watch it, must be taken more as a fantasy story than a historical fiction or non-fiction story.
B00030590I|1.0|The one star is not for the movie itself, which is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But argh! I've got the Japanese DVD from Elite Group and it is so far superior to the North American release in all aspects (image quality, subtitles, disc pressing quality, and even the box!) that this version makes me want to cry.    Also, I'm getting tired of defending this movie to people who've only gotten the North American version of the subtitles. It's like we're not even talking about the same movie anymore.    What a thing to do to such a beautiful piece of art. How do these people sleep at night?    Looking through the other comments below, I followed Raul Saavedra's advice and checked out the difference between the image quality in the special features, and the movie itself. He has a very astute point. The main movie image quality just ends up looking that much worse in comparison. Why do the scenes look so awesome in the special features sections? My theory is that they tried to cram too much onto one disc (the Japanese release is 2 DVDs), and had to compress the video even more than the overseas releases to make up for it, so the image quality of the movie itself suffered.    PS. Go here for a detailed comparison review of the different versions:  [...]
B00008EY9G|4.0|I was not impressed with this movie until the very end.  The end saved this otherwise, boring, so it is up to you.  Do you want to watch an alright movie, just to get to the good ending?
4789009637|5.0|This book really helps me learning Japanese from the very beggining. if ure looking for a best Japanese book, this book should fit you.highly recommended!
0140277447|1.0|The topic was interesting. I knew very little about the China-Japan part of WWII. If such a horrific occurance had gone under-reported, that would be really a crime. But this book is, sadly, kind of boring. It is also very repetitive, as though the story could have been a short news artiicle or series of articles. (A magazine article). Too bad this had to be expanded to make it appear book-size. If you buy a hard-copy, the font of the print is large and the margins are wide. May have made a passable graduate thesis. <br />
B0000797IO|3.0|(Assuming that the reader has read the synopsis...) <br />Wow, Jennifer Aniston actually CAN act and Jake Gyllenhaal was very good, (pay attention to the little things he adds to the story and his character). I personally wouldn't have even watched this movie in the first place if it wasn't for the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors, but I am glad I did. The story really isn't that complex or abnormal, just one of one woman's unsatisfaction with her life, and how she realizes that she has the power to make life what she wants it to be. She thinks she has found someone in Holden who, unlike her stoner husband, can really understand her. The end is the unique part, you can make of it whatever you choose. You can look at it as dark, a comedy, or light with its dark parts. This is a film that will leave a lasting impression on you, and make you take a step back and look at your own life. Basically, the story isn't complex, but the insight to the deepest of human emotions and tendencies make this a worth-while film.
1401301010|3.0|This really isn't so much about the Chili Peppers as it is a diary in the life of an LA junkie. And for an honest account of an addict and addictive behaviour, its an excellent but at times quite depressing read. Although Anthony is clearly dealing with his addiction demons, he still completely fails to account for his other flaws - like basic social skills and awareness of impact of actions on others (instead of making out it's their problem exclusively). I would also have liked to hear more about how he felt toward Blackie (his father)... there is not one condemnation there and that is amazing considering Blackie gets the gold medal for worst parent in the world. thus the boy-man still gives the game away - still quite immature in many ways for a forty something and probably always will be so... but then its almost impossible to dislike him, in spite of everything - he is not the sort of bloke people say awful things about - if anything the guy just has the gift of endearing himself to even the worst people-hater. buy it - if for anything its probably more honest than most auto bios on the shelf.

B000H5TVKI|3.0|I notoriously hate re-reviewing films. I've reviewed them once, I forget about the reviews. I also notoriously hate re-watching movies that I don't particularly want to watch again. Yes, everyone gets it into their heads once in a while that they simply have to re-watch a movie, but for me, I have to be really in the mood. And sometimes it can be MORE than five years, before I feel the need/urge/whatever to watch a movie again.<br /><br />I have a confession to make - the first film I ever saw Mr Stallone in was Demolition Man (I'll have a DVD with the cut full frontal scene please). Hated him in it. I only watched it for Sandra Bullock, and that's because she is one of my favourite actresses. Back then, when I first saw it (taped off the TV don't you know), I didn't like Sly at all. I also didn't like this when I first saw it.<br /><br />But recently, I've been watching more Sly movies (Rocky's etc), and I have another confession to make - I think I've got a little crush on him. He's old enough to be my dad, but I think it's something to do with the eyes.<br /><br />First Blood is about a Vietnam veteran called John Rambo. He's what is called a 'drifter' - not a word I particularly like. He's still severely mentally affected after the war, and has numerous flashbacks (I had a blonde moment, and said the flashbacks were to the 'first' movie - duh!) During his wandering, after finding one of his friends in the war was killed by cancer, he comes across a small town, and met by the very unfriendly sheriff, who takes an instant dislike to Rambo. (Good looking, tall, dark eyes, looking very trim in some scenes - yeah, I can see how you would take an instant dislike to him.) The sheriff drops him off outside the town, but Rambo defiantly walks back into the town, kicking off a chain reaction of events.<br /><br />There's one scene that stands out in First Blood for me - the scene in the police station where Rambo is getting finger printed. I find it absolutely hilarious! He tries to wipe the ink off his fingers with a paper towel, but it gets snatched off him! It's the look on his face, a simple expression but enough to make me giggle anyway! And he still picks up another!<br /><br />First Blood is actually based on a book, which I didn't expect, and there are quite a few differences between it and the film. The film has a reputation for being really violent, but I found the Rocky movies to be more violent in that sense. However, the total body count of the movie is four; the cop who falls out of the helicopter and the three officers in the cop car who crash into a parked car. Overly violent? Not as much as some movies.<br /><br />I'd say to anyone who hated First Blood/Mr Stallone on first viewing, watch it again. Give him a chance. I wouldn't say that for anybody *cough*. It's a good action movie, and Sly acts his sad eyes out. Definitely better (in my opinion) on second viewing.his fingers with a paper towel, but it gets snatched off him!

B000002HH2|5.0|One dark night a couple of years ago I was driving a long way to get back home.  Tired and feeling somewhat sad--a relationship was coming apart quite badly, and it was ever present in my mind.  What did I do wrong?  Why did this happen?  You know.   <br /> <br />Post was playing on my CD player, and I was just half-paying attention to it.  Then suddenly the music caught my attention:  \\"You've Been Flirting Again\\" had come on, with the lyrics: \\"Give her some time, give her some space, how you reacted was right.\\"  Those words immediately made me feel a whole lot better.  I was indeed giving her time and space. I took this as a sign that perhaps it'd work out after all.   And lo and behold, later that year, she and I were together again, visiting Paris. <br /> <br />\\"Flirting\\" segues into \\"Isobel,\\" a modern musical marvel.  Unlike most songs, I don't mind it when I can't get this one out of my head.   \\"It's So Quiet\\" is a cute big-band chart that shows off Bjork's range, from soft cooing to over-the-top screaming--but all under control.  All of the other songs are works of art  in their own ways. \\"Headphones\\" is a low-key, lethargic and introspective affair that is the perfect way to end a glorious album. <br /> <br />I have all of Bjork's solo albums, and I'm hard-pressed to find a single track on any of them that isn't a gem.  Post ranks slightly ahead of Selmasongs on my list.  It simply is stunning. <br /> <br />
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|I was actually wanting to watch this movie, and insisted on watching it, despite the fact it's not a Christmas movie & lets face it, we're on the run up to Christmas here. Also, I loved the poster. It's very effective & yet, doesn't give anything away about the movie. Neither does the title. Which to me, would have been plus points towards the movie. And since these are the only two things I found good about this movie, then that's the reason I'm giving it two stars.<br /><br />There's plenty of typical horror movie cliches in this, and ends on a really dumb note, losing the viewer's attention once they've worked out what's going to happen.<br /><br />Halle Berry looks fairly different to how she normally does, and I was loving the fringe. But the fact that she's super skinny in this was very distracting for me. She needs a good feeding, and if she turned sideways, and there was a crack in the floor, then she'd go straight through. Halle broke her arm filming a scene with Robert Downey Jr.. Downey was supposed to grab her arm and twist but twisted too hard and the arm snapped. Berry wore a cast during the rest of the filming, which is visible at times. Production was halted for eight weeks.<br /><br />The setting of the movie is extremely depressing, with no variation on the setting outside of the psychiatric hospital, apart from the occasional flashback. Some movies can pull this off, but when you're watching it in the dark, and not really getting it in the first place, then the rooms just merge into one, and you can't tell between the scenes.<br /><br />Roles also shift constantly throughout the movie. The crazy people seem normal, the normal people seem crazy, and the responsible people seem dangerous. There are so many suspects in this movie, which in these kinda movies, is normal, but when it's been done over & over, it's really no different to any other movies of the same genre.<br /><br />I found this movie very boring and wouldn't recommend it at all. It disappoints at its best, and leaves you utterly bored by the end.ll. It disappoints at its best, and leaves you utterly bored by the end.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album is amazing; every track is beautiful.  I know that some say that the lyrics are immature and meaningless, but at least they're coherent; at least the lyrics make sense, unlike some of the lyrics by mainstream bands.  Avril Lavigne is very talented and I think she'll do well and continue to record beautiful albums.
B000067FP7|3.0|I reckon quite a few people will be very surprised when they find out that I'm nearly 21, and I've only just seen Gremlins. I don't know why I never saw it when I was a kid, or seen it on the TV at Christmas. It's weird. I wasn't even sure about the storyline when it was put on. Obviously, I knew the character Gizmo - having begged my Dad to get me the toy in a window a few years ago, and never got it. :( I also think that the Gizmo/Gremlins started off the craze of Furbies in the UK a couple of years ago - little characters that if you switch them on, and line them up with others, they talk/sing utter nonsense to each other! I'm actually sure I still have a few more in my room somewhere, but not Gizmo ones, although I'm sure they're out there.<br /><br />I was completely unaware of what the film was actually about, and wasn't expecting the 'evil' Gremlins to quite literally come out of Gizmo, and take over the world. I was expecting a nice little happy family movie, based around Gizmo. I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed the movie if I'd been a few years younger, as the evil Gremlins scared the bejeezus out of me! Especially Stripe - scary! There's also some Looney Tunes references in the movie, although coming from my major Looney Tunes fan man, there's even more references in the second one, which I've yet to see. Of course, it was directed by Joe Dante, who did the fabulous Looney Tunes: Back In Action, amongst many others. There's also some other references in the movie: the theatre marquee is showing a double bill: \\"A Boy's Life\\" (the working title for Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial), and \\"Watch the Skies\\" (the working title for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind). At the movie's finale the Gremlin leader, Stripe, hides from Billy in a pile of stuffed animals. A plush E.T. doll is shown prominently in the shot. This is a gag reference to the scene in Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, in which E.T. also evades discovery by hiding among plush toys.<br /><br />I didn't spot this until it was pointed out, but while the father is talking on the phone from the inventor's convention, the machine from The Time Machine can be seen in the background winding up to full power. The scene cuts to the house, and when we cut back again, the machine has gone, leaving only a wisp of colored smoke.<br /><br />Also, there are quite a few cameos in Gremlins, so next time you watch this, watch out for them! Steven Spielberg is the man in the electric wheelchair with a TV monitor. Chuck Jones is the man who looks at Billy's cartoon in the bar. There is a Warner Brothers cartoon playing on the TV. Jerry Goldsmith is at the inventors' conference, immediately behind actor Hoyt Axton in the phone booth. He's wearing a western hat with a mount for the phone. Rumoured to appear as a blink-and-you'll-miss-it-cameo too is George Lucas at the inventor's convention, riding a bicycle.<br /><br />In Cantonese Chinese, mogwai means demon or gremlin. The Mandarin pronunciation is mogui.<br /><br />The special edition of this DVD looks really good, with enough to keep a die-hard fan of extras going for ages. These are mostly your stereo-typical extras, but they include: commentary by Joe Dante, Phoebe Cates, Zach Galligan, Dick Miller and Howie Mandel; commentary by director Joe Dante, producer Michael Finnell and effects specialist Chris Walas; 10 minutes of never-before-seen footage; behind-the-scenes documentary; and photo/storyboard gallery. Two deleted scenes that were included on the Special Edition DVD appeared in some of the original merchandise for the movie. Since most such tie-ins received a script well in advance in order to have product at the time the movie premieres, several things may change within the picture in the meantime. The deleted extended opening is included in the first of 5 book and record sets that Hardee's released with their kids' meals. The scene with Judge Reinhold hiding in the bank vault wasincluded in the trading card set. In addition to restoring the classic Warner Brothers logo to the opening of the movie, it was hoped to release the film along with the classic Looney Tunes short, Fallen Hare, where Bugs Bunny is harassed by a plane gremlin during WW II. This fell through, but, highlights from the short do appear as part of a making of special for the movie, that has also been included on the Special Edition DVD.<br /><br />Little to no actual dialogue for the Gremlins and Mogwai exists in the script in itself. In addition to several instances of on stage rewrites changing or adding to much of the script, the voiceovers were all mostly ad libs, repeating snippets of just performed dialogue or in reaction to other sound effects or environment. To this end, Howie Mandel recorded Gizmo's lines phonetically for foreign dubs of the movie, where localized dialogue and in jokes helped make the picture successful with audiences world wide.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this movie now, although I'd be slightly wary of children seeing it, despite it being aimed at families. It definitely would have given me nightmares! It'll be interesting to see more Gizmo and his evil friends, and I'm glad that although this ends on a slightly bad note, the sequel should be better.vault was included in the trading card set.

This fell through, but, highlights from the short do appear as part of a making of special for the movie, that has also been included on the Special Edition DVD. <br /> <br />Little to no actual dialogue for the Gremlins and Mogwai exists in the script in itself. In addition to several instances of on stage rewrites changing or adding to much of the script, the voiceovers were all mostly ad libs, repeating snippets of just performed dialogue or in reaction to other sound effects or environment. To this end, Howie Mandel recorded Gizmo's lines phonetically for foreign dubs of the movie, where localized dialogue and in jokes helped make the picture successful with audiences world wide. <br /> <br />I'd highly recommend this movie now, although I'd be slightly wary of children seeing it, despite it being aimed at families. It definitely would have given me nightmares! It'll be interesting to see more Gizmo and his evil friends, and I'm glad that although this ends on a slightly bad note, the sequel should be better.
B00005QDW1|1.0|If you'd like to have this album without buying it, you can just download the 30 second samples from Amazon.com and then loop them a few times over.  That's all this album is - mindless looping.  I would guess that, minus the loops, this album is maybe 10 to 15 minutes long, if that.  Oh, what a piece of trash this album is.  Other No Doubt albums are MUCH better.
630289915X|5.0|This is the best kind of feel-good, goodness triumphs movie.  This was the great type of americana Hollywood used to produce before they got kinky in later years.  It also had the Scrooge-like philosophy of going back to see what life was like if things had changed.  It really makes one think about themselves.  But it really shines with the triumph of the human spirit.
6305907145|5.0|You literary purists--get over it! If you watched the credits, you'll have seen that this film is inspired by and based on the novel, as well as Austen's letters and other writings. The director's emphasis is clearly on a broader sociohistorical context--one admittedly driven by a 20th-century feminist perspective--but this makes the film no less successful. The editing is superlative--note in particular the ball sequence at midpoint and the final shots that close the film--as is the acting, the direction, the cinematography, and the soundtrack. Highly rated! Far better than the usual fluff of period films!

0790732254|5.0|If you are looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy, please don't watch this.  If you prefer films that have a happy ending, you won't like this one. If you are intellectually incapable of appreciating an intense character study of a profoundly disfunctional couple, watch re-runs of Leave it too Beaver.  If none of this applies to you, watch it.
6305127646|5.0|The reviewer who compared this film to the Godzilla fim with Matthew Broderick is completely wrong. Why? Because Broderick's \\"Godzilla\\" was NOT the character that fans had come to know in any way shape or form. Is the same true of The Saint? Hell no. This works fine as a modern take on the origin of the character. He's an expert criminal who aids the innocent. The cynics who can't accept that should stay away from this, and all versions of the is wonderful character, and stick to colouring books. I've been reading Simon's adventures for decades and have no problems with this version. It's superb.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy is kind of like Pearl Jam's take on a concept album.  It has all the great, somewhat related songs and the ususally necessary filler that comes from a concept album.  The fillers(Bugs, Pry, To, Aye Davanita, and Stupid Mop) aren't really terrible, in fact Bugs is hilarious and Aye Davanita and Pry, To have good vibes.  My two favorite songs are Tremor Christ and Immortality, but there are a bunch of other relly good ones like Corduroy, Satan's Bed, and Not For You.  Overall, this album is pretty cohesive, more so than most of the band's others.  While not Pearl Jam's best effort, it's still the one I've listened to the most.
0385336810|5.0|What a page-turner this book is! I've read all of the author's Shopaholic books and was very pleased to note that Can You Keep a Secret? is just as good as the Shopaholic series. This novel is centered around a normal, 20something woman named Emma who works as a marketing assistant. Everything is normal that is, until she meets a stranger on a plane. In a moment of weakness during turbulence Emma dispenses all of her innermost thoughts and secrets to the man beside her on the plane. She figures it will be ok to divulge this information as she will probably never see him again.... Until he turns out to be the head of her company in town to visit the office!!! This book is great. You'll love finding out what happens when Emma's secrets become common knowledge to her friends, family and coworkers. Some things are better left unsaid... or are they????

It's been amazing to see him light up and even giggle at certain parts. After one pass through of the video however he begins to get fussy. BE videos are a must have for new parents. They entertain the baby just long enough for you to get a load of laundry done or dust around the livingroom.

B00009V7P8|5.0|The song blaring in the scene where Natalie Portman dances privately for Clive Owen is The Smiths' How Soon Is Now (I am the son and the heir...).  I saw the movie CLOSER this past weekend and was haunted by the song that opens and closes the movie.  The song was The Blower's Daughter, and it is so achingly beautiful.  I'm not surprised to learn that Damien Rice's debut album has critics raving if this song is anything to go by.
B000687M48|2.0|First, I am an Evanescence fan.  That's why it's painful to have to admit that this DVD/CD \\"live\\" set is horribly disappointing.  The only part of the concert that is live is the voice of Amy Lee.  Everything else is pre-recorded.  No wonder some of the reviewers here state that the band sounds great.  Of course they do.  All they had to do was show up and pretend to play.  That's why you don't see any clear shots of the musicians in the concert footage.  A sour guitar note or a stray drum beat is ever heard.  It's all hocus-pocus.  What a shame that the fans don't get to see and hear a real live performance in this DVD.  Save your money and just by a traditional Evanescence studio CD.

B00067BBQE|4.0|*** 1/2 - THREE 1/2 STARS <br /> <br />I rated the CD 3 stars. The DVD gets 3 1/2.... <br /> <br />This live performance is nothing special. They're clearly a band that is still continueing to grow, and although it's  asolid live effort, it falls short all around...  <br /> <br />They're not one of the best live bands around, and this DVD proves just that. They need more fire when it comes to performing live, and more tightness as well. They're a fine young band on the rise, and in time will improve, but this live CD / DVD really wasn't necessary.... <br /> <br />The best part of this DVD is the bonus footage. You get to see the band on tour, and hanging out doing their normal things. That's what I like to see when it comes to getting to know a band, and this DVD has all of that.... <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to listening to their next studio release. This will be a nice addition to my Evanescence collection, but not something I'd watch on a regular basis.... <br /> <br />

B00004YYDI|5.0|Jean Reno and Natalie Portman turn out possibly the best performances of their lives in this movie, and this says a lot for Portman, who was about 12 when she co-starred in this film. But I am getting ahead of myself... <br /> <br />Matilda's (Portman)entire family is wiped out by crooked lawman Stansfield, played chillingly by Gary Oldman, over drugs. No, Matilda didn't exactly have a great home life in that little apartment, but they killed her little brother, and this drives the young girl's thirst for revenge. Her own life is spared by a neighbor, Leon (Reno), when he lets her into his apartment as the carnage ends a few doors down. Leon is a simple, practical, clean living cleaner, or hit man.  He and his plant live a quiet and necessarily lonely existence. <br /> <br />Matilida steals Leon's heart, however, and eventually, she convinces him to teach her the tricks of his trade. Their relationship is delightful to watch. The chemistry between the two actors and characters is the most natural I have seen in cinema. Matilda falls in love with the man, and though there are scenes in this movie that border on the disturbing, Leon never treats her as anything other than a daughter - a daughter that he loves and respects with all that he is.  There is nothing sordid in this relationship, though as Matilda, Portman pushes the envelope just enough to make us hold our breath. Aside from that, Natalie Portman outright shines. Most actors and actresses struggle to be taken seriously in their trade for many years. Portman gets much deserved respect as a serious actress with this film alone...and at 12 years old.  <br /> <br />Leon is complex in his simplicity. He is not the stereotypical Hollywood hit man in that he is some pretty, bad-boy with a Dentyne gleam smile for the camera and witty one liners. He is portrayed as a very real person who lives his his life as he does out of necessity because of what he does. And he does his job well, but it is a job and that is not all that defines him as we get to know him, and he opens himself up to a profound relationship with this child. He is bewildered by Matilda, and this is hilariously played out in the scene where they are playing charades. Leon has a big heart, and despite his teaching a child how to effectively kill people, you have no choice but to love him.  <br /> <br />Gary Oldman delivers a notable performance. Some might argue that it was over the top, but he was amazing. Killing people, popping pills, sweating profusely through cold and clever dialogue, the guy is truly scary. He is honestly the stuff of nightmares, and manages to steal several scenes. He is evil personified.  <br /> <br />This is one of the best movies ever made. No matter how many times I watch it, I feel as though I am watching it for the first time. I can't say enough for this movie. I gush with no apologies.
B000000Y87|4.0|I am not as enthusiastic about this album as the reviewers that wrote before me. I often find the Bill Evans trio to be unbalanced, with the drums taking more prominence than they perhaps merit. I was tempted to give the recording three stars. However, I recalled some of the better flashes of brilliance: the absolute, near-telepathic tightness of track 01 (Gloria's Step), the intensity of track 03 (\\"solar\\"), Scott LaFaro's compelling bass solo on track 03, and the sublime compositional content of \\"Jade Visions.\\" <br />Important historically, so I recommend it to jazz lovers. Everyone else should be wary: decide whether you like it by listening to the sample tracks on Amazon before purchasing.
B00000JLWW|2.0|Set against the backdrop of the world's most famous sinking ship, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio take us on a voyage through possibly the most boring and predictable love triangle ever thought of outside of \\"Pearl Harbor\\". Billy Zane plays the other corner of this triangle as a total jerk (but he looks good!), and for a good portion of the movie, we see the development of this romance between Winslet the society girl and DiCaprio the street urchin with perfect teeth.  'Nuff said, we all know how these things go.    I keep wondering what the DiCaprio mystique is, because I am a woman, and a petite one at that, but when I look at this guy, I feel like a behemoth.  That is not a turn on. I am not into guys that look like they have yet to hit puberty, so I fail to understand his appeal, and were I a society girl that was out slummin', I couldn't imagine hooking up with DiCaprio. C'mon folks, weren't there any hot Irish guys on this doomed ship?    The best character in this movie was played by Kathy Bates, who can do no wrong, as \\"The Unsinkable\\" Molly Brown.     I fail to understand the appeal of this love story, but perhaps this is why I never watch the Lifetime Channel. This chick is not into chick flicks, and can count only a few among my favorite movies. This isn't one of them.    The best part of this movie is probably the last hour. The special effects are amazing as we watch the Titanic sink in perfect recreation of the real, horrifying event.  The third class passengers' horror at being left to die was disturbing in a good way, and the band playing on as the ship sank was haunting. Mercifully, and where I cheered, was when DiCaprio's face disappeared beneath the cold, Atlantic waters. Is it bad of me to say that? If it is, I don't care.    I would have given this movie three stars if I were rating cinematography, costume design, and special effects, but those three things do not make a good movie. They only make it pretty. And it was pretty. Winslet's gownswere stunning. As a history buff, seeing the disaster recreated so beautifully and accurately was a treat.     Truth be told, the acting is good, so that earned it one star at least. It's not the cast's fault that this movie is a yawner of a sap-fest when stripped of its pretties. The other star is an automatic because I sat through it, so it was at least compelling enough to watch once.    Once.
B0000009SY|4.0|The message of this album is what makes it great: the music is less than I have come to expect from Zappa. <br />The unequivocal message of free speech and the insidiousness of censorship has never been delivered in a more appropriate format: a curse-word, sexual-reference-filled album by one of the kings of curse words and sexual references in music. The character of the central scrutinizer is a brilliant stroke, with Zappa's characteristic nonsensical flair. Ike Willis' Joe, desptie the weirdness of the album, is someone we can sympathize with, even in the operatic sense (and this is a rock opera, n'est-ce pas?) <br />The music is less complex than Zappa's usual, although it has his mark of sarcasm. <br />Recommended for lovers of liberty.
6305212112|3.0|This film was pretty much what I expected, from both word of mouth and packaging: a somewhat predictable and manipulative tear-jerker (read: soap!) rife with made-for-TV cliches but still well directed/written enough to be fairly enjoyable, with one fairly original and intriguing main character played by Mary Stuart Masterson.  There were parts so trite and corny I felt compelled to leave the room (e.g. the wife-beating husband) but otherwise the movie held my attention pretty well.<br /><br />It really is a story within a story, with the present-day protagonist (Bates) being inspired and, in typical Hollywood fashion, transformed by the story she's told by a woman she meets while visiting an in-law at the local nursing home---Jessica Tandy, who is easily the most radiant and splendid woman in the cast.<br /><br />There is a quasi-feminist subtext of women empowering themselves and other women, which I wish had been developed in greater detail and on a less superficial level and with fewer cliches.  But at least there's a subtext in the first place, something usually missing in these types of films which just concentrate on making you identify with the characters and cry/laugh on cue.<br /><br />Good light entertainment, on the whole.  And men: if you're on the make, this film should get you well past second base!  : )<br /><br />All the predictability and melodrama make this one hard to watch more than once, though.<br /><br />3.5 stars
B00062J00S|3.0|The ending of this movie is totally outrageous, and yet somehow perfect.  I had a nagging sense that with the ending Frank Capra was trying to keep me in line, making sure I keep treating people with respect and all that nonsense.  And he fully expects me to do so knowing that I know it is not in my best interest. In fact he spends the first ¾ of the film telling me that to be unselfish in a selfish world will lead to my demise.  But I already knew that.  Still, myself and millions of others watch this film, every year, fooling ourselves into thinking that our kindness will be rewarded.  Self-delusions are not the only reason I will recommend this film.  James Stewart is, as always, worth the price of admission.  The script is very smart and witty, and there is no way to deny the charm of these characters.  You will fall in love with George Bailey as his hopes and dreams are put on hold while he prevents his town from selling out to The Man.  I also got a big kick out of watching Bert and Ernie hanging out together.  We, as Americans, love to cheer George Bailey for choosing humanity over money.  Yet we also, continually, choose money over humanity.  In that respect it's a good thing this movie has survived through the decades, and maybe one day we will all quit contributing to Pottersville.<br />3.5 out of 5
B0006GAI78|5.0|i was never a gere fan.  a little dorf in the swiss alps had this one film playing, so we went.  i've seen it five times so far. twice in german and couldn't wait to get back to the states for the english version.  susan sarandon and stanley tucci were the subpoenas. But all the characters were wonderful, each one having a story that has resolution in the film. I think the supporting characters and the music puts this version ahead of the original japanese (which i also loved). i never thought i'd become a richard gere fan, or place a hollywood remake above a smash cult foreign film. But it's a delightful surprise.
B000002NIW|5.0|This cd is perfect. Every second of this audio masterpiece (except maybe the division between \\"Mx\\" and the secret track \\"Damone\\") is golden. The Deftones never cease to amaze. This one is a major step-up from Adrenaline, because the noise is now more controlled, but still just as raw. These guys know what they're doing, and they still don't care about what anyone thinks of it. It's aggressive, yet melodic in parts, but mainly aggressive. Tracks like \\"Headup\\" and \\"Lotion\\" point to Adrenaline most obviously in the sheer intensity they exihibt, while other songs like \\"My Own Summer\\" and \\"Lhabia\\" show a more progressive rock style emerging. Chino really displays tons of emotion on this disc, whether on the heart-broken \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" (in my opinion, the greatest Deftones song ever written), or when he's growling his way through the bridge on the creepy, heavy \\"Dai the Flu\\". The lyrics, as with all Deftones songs, are very interesting to read and you will most likely never figure out the true meanings! If they have true meanings...anyways, Chino is a true poet with his words and it shows here brilliantly. \\"Around the Fur\\" is a classic cd. Buy it now or you're missing out.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Revivals are revivals are revivals, and up-and-comers will always get flamed for sounding too much like \\"insert name of well-known, band of the past\\".  <br /> <br />Be that as it may, I argue that the Joy Division tag Interpol is constantly being given is extraneous. There is an inherent similarity, and comparisons are inevitable. But I think that what Interpol as a collective bring to the music is completely unique from Joy Division. After all, Interpol themselves don't even cite Joy Division as a notable influence on their musical development. Consequently, it seems the boys have gone on their own musical journey, and yielded comprable results, manifest in different ways.  <br /> <br />The \\"gothic\\" tag too often given to Interpol is completely erroneous. While it may perhaps be accurate for Joy Division, these are NOT the same bands, contexts, or even sounds. The fact is, Interpol can be sad, and can be lugubrious, but can also be cheeky and energetic. For every \\"Untitled\\" and \\"NYC\\", there are songs like \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\" and \\"Roland\\", odes to lusty desire and Polish, knife-carrying best friends respectively.  <br /> <br />Paul Banks seems to take himself too seriously at times, and at others not at all, on the one hand hoping that living free is not behind him, on the other encouraging a young woman he fancies to \\"1, 2, 3- do [him]\\". His lyrics sometimes toe the line of the ludicrous, but ultimately, this man is driven by an intellectual and symbolic objective (His \\"bad\\", dangerous girl doesn't drink, party, or sleep around; she can read). The simplicity of the instrumentation is buttressed by the sheer beauty of his voice, which seems to function as the most well-defined melodic device for the group. A description as monotone is tantamount to misunderstanding- it is exactly because of the range and the function over the repetitive rhythms of the instruments that his vocals are so effective: one comes to immediately recognize the nuances in his singing, and appreciate the deep moroseness and sorrow, or hollowness depending on the context, that he utilizes. <br /> <br />Simply put, this is a beautiful album, and despite its failure to invent a whole new genre of music, we must remember that is no reason to deem it unworthy. Interpol is an invitation to enjoy melancholy, and to ignore it as well. After all, it is important to note that these musicians were philosophy majors before their record deals, not drop-outs. \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" is an intellectual invitation, fraught with existential positions one need only pay attention to to recognize. This album is not a foray into depression, it is an acknowledgement of beauty in both the dark and the light, and is a hell of a lot of fun to dance to. These are not cheap, Joy Division knock-offs. They are be <br />autiful musicians, coming to fruition on their own.
B00064VR0W|5.0|This is absolutely the best Rod Stewart DVD so far.The mix of his classic material and material from his \\"American Songbook\\" series is great; 12 classic Rod songs & 5 \\"American Songbook\\" songs. <br />The video is stunning and the audio is crystal clear. You have a choice of 2.0 stereo or 5.1 surround. Both are great. <br />Special guests on this extravaganza are Ronnie Wood, Chrissie Hynde, and a Scottish busker named Amy Belle (a future star?).Rod's girlfriend also appears in a stunning role on one of the songs. <br />Overall, a fantastic show with rousing audience participation to boot. <br />I highly recommend this DVD.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|\\"Elf\\" is one of those rare films that is impervious to criticism.  It is a fun and funny film that espouses the spirit of Christmas and actually means it.  As a counterpoint, just recall \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" of a few years ago, a film that allegedly was about the commercialism of the holiday yet wholeheartedly embraced said consumerism.  Credit has to be given to Will Ferrell who jumps into the role of Buddy, the human adopted by elves, with reckless, yet sweet, comic abandonment.  Buddy is essentially a man-child, but Ferrell makes his belief in the spirit of Christmas infectious.  James Caan does an amusing turn as Buddy's slow-burning gruff biological father.  And it's nice to see old-pros like Bob Newhart and Ed Asner as Papa Elf and Santa Clause, respectively.  Peter Dinklage has an amusing cameo as an ill-tempered children's author.  Credit has to go to director John Favreau for not going saccharine, or, even worse, making this a cynical exercise.  I'm not sure if this is classic stuff, but it'll do.  One quibble is some of the off-color humor was superfluous, but that will probably go over younger viewers heads.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I grew up listening to my dad play Johnny Cash songs on the guitar and the whole family singing. This was my favorite album when I was a kid.

Johnny is funny while interacting with the prisoners and sounds great. <br /> <br />Johnny Cash will always be a favorite for me and now he is becoming a favorite of my children. The legend lives!

B00009V7P8|5.0|...in the scene where Natalie Portman is in the strip club, dancing for Clive Owen?  The background song is something from the '80's - it sounds like a darker INXS or Depeche Mode, and I know that I've heard the song, but I can't think of it.  I mention it here because I'm hoping that people looking for Damien Rice after seeing the movie will be able to answer the question for me.   <br /> <br />Thanks.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. The first time I saw it was on the AMC channel on tv. Of course that was the edited version, but still, the movie made me laugh AND cry. Being a high school student myself, I really 'connected' with this film in a way. I would recommend it to all high school students!!!! Although there are many movies with the same message as this one, I think this one is the best because there are no distractions. Please parents, rent this (or buy it) for your kids, they will thank you for it!!!
B0002S947K|5.0|Every once in a while you hear music that you can't get out of your head. This is how I feel about Ray LaMontagne's Trouble. It's not just one or two songs but the entire list that has stuck with me since I bought the CD. Whether it's in the car after a day of work or trail running, the songs keep moving me. My only criticism is that he doesn't have a second or third one out there for me to purchase.

I rented it this year(2004) on a whim and was surprised what an impact it had. Great movie to overcome the cynical times we live in. It actually does remind us what it is all about.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I am going to try to refrain from writing a lengthy review for this film, and keep it as succint as possible, although for a film like this, the task almost seems impossible. Many reviewers have already said some things that I am going to say, and would have liked to say, but the review will go on, anyway.<br /><br />This is a powerful movie, in which it's main theme centers around drug abuse & addiction, and the dangerous consequences that may follow. But, the film centers on more than just drug abuse and addiction: to me it also centers on life, and how the average folk go about trying to embellish what seems like the emptiness of life. To try and enhance (and possibly) facilitate the meaning of that last sentence, think about this: many people do -- and/or try to reach for -- things that are supposed to make one's life more meaningful and complete: getting married, experiencing the birth of one's first child, going to college, becoming wealthy and/or famous, et al. In society, we are basically brought up to believe that if we follow along certain patterns (e.g. becoming wealthy, etc), we will be happy & fulfilled. One of the many things this film shows us, is that sometimes, what we are brought up to believe, can be a devastating illusion, or at least, there is a strong possibility of this.<br /><br />This story focuses on four main characters, and their addiction to drugs. The story is also cleverly told over the course of four seasons (three, technically), and like another reviewer pointed out a few pages back, the mood of each season correlates with the psychological and circumstantial happenings of each character (or vice versa.) The film starts with the Summer, which correlates with adolescent feelings. In this case, these four characters seemed as if they were happy (or at least we may think they are happy), and seemed to be filled with laughs, smiles and confidence in their future and dreams. In the Autumn, which represents added responsibility, and preparation for \\"darker times\\", things start to slowly go downhill for the gang. We can see their circumstances beginning to spiral, and their dispositions begin to follow downward as well. By, Winter (which represents \\"death\\" or the \\"ending\\"), each of these four members seem to meet the \\"finality\\" of their fates, to disturbing effect, to say the least. Spring, which represents birth, and fresh, new beginnings, never arrived. Heavy stuff, there.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about the camera techniques used in this film to be nothing more than flash for flash's sake, and similarly, some have said that some of the disturbing scenes found in the film were there for shock value only. I couldn't disagree more. For starters, like another reviewer has pointed out, the \\"speeding up\\" and \\"slowing down\\" techniques are supposed to correlate with the \\"speeding\\" or \\"raciness\\" of the characters' thought processes while under the influence of...well...speed (and other drugs.) I found this to be very clever and fascinating. Secondly, while there *are* indeed disturbing images in the film, I didn't necessarily find the images to be the most disturbing aspect of the film, but rather *how* these images were shot. In other words, it's more *psychologically* disturbing, than it is *graphically* disturbing, if that can be basically understood. The way this film was made alone, should not be taken lightly, and it is indeed clever and noteworthy filmmaking. You'd have to see the film for yourself to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about.<br /><br />Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly did wonderful and convincing jobs in their respective roles. Their performances truly helped to make the film what it was, and it wouldn't have been as complete without them. Ellen Burstyn's performance seemed to get a droves-worth of accolades, and deservedly so. Her performance was undoubtedly the most frightening, disturbing and heart-wrenching thing about this film. In moments, her character made me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether. The whole movie is powerful indeed, and the last segment (Winter) is indeed the most intense and hellish part of the movie.<br /><br />I watched this film with another member of my family, and by the time the \\"Winter\\" segment had arrived, we were *both* saying things like, \\"I will *never* watch this movie again. It's a little *too* much reality.\\" Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving, this film will stay in your mind long after it has ended, and many will gather their own responses as to what the movie meant to them. And, if some of you think that what happened to these characters can't happen to anyone in real-life, think again: it's *very* real, and *can* happen (and no doubt *has* happened to some in real-life.) Indeed, reality can be too much at times.<br /><br />Before I close out this review, let me share a brief story with you about someone who used drugs: it was documented in a program (I can't remember the name of it right now) that a female experimented with a drug, and not too long after that, her friends were quick to comment that she was becoming excessively paranoid and delusional. She was sent to a specialist who did a brain scan on her. When the doctor took a look at the scan, we the viewers (and no doubt the girl, and her mother, who happened to be alongside her) saw something *very* disturbing: there were various holes -- large holes -- throughout her brain: like the equivalent of looking at a piece of cheese after a mouse had nipped through it quite well. The result? This girl now suffers from acute bipolar/manic-depressive disorder. And you know what else? This was the result of her experimenting with a drug: after ONLY ONE TRY! That's right, this girl is now stuck with a \\"psychotic disorder\\" for the rest of her life, as the result of her experimenting with a drug after only *one* try. Yes, indeed, reality can be a bummer. I recommend seeing this film at least once; this goes for everyone.de me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether.

B0002ZDVF4|2.0|After Bourne Identity which was terrific. I expected even better sequel. Sad to say. Not even so. First of all, Marie was killed after being shot accidentally while the intended victim was Bourne. Which quite frankly I didn't understand since. In the Bourne novels she is very much alive. But the sequel failed to explain how Bourne came to be. The plot in the movie had so many unexplained answers to questions that need answering. That it was more actionfest than movie. Keep Bourne Identity in your library not Supremacy.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I love this book, but I have to admit that I watched the newest 'Peter Pan' movie, starring Jeremy Sumpter, before I actually read the classic.  Although the movie including many exact or related lines right from the novel and most of the same major scenes, I found that, in the movie, there was that 'puppy-love glow' between Peter and Wendy that just made the storyline so much more interesting and sweet.  The novel does show some sense of that, but not as much as the movie.  The whole idea that Peter tries to hide his feelings for Wendy yet act completely irrisistable at the same time...or at the end when Peter and Hook are fighting and Hook makes him realize that he is incomplete and so on. How the movie focuses on 'feelings' in the individual stages of childhood, youth, and adulthood are most interesting and are well demonstrating in the movie.  Now, I love this book very much, but I suppose I was a little disappointed when it did not include such things.
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is great. Especially, if you enjoy 80's. This album has a feel for the 80's with a modern twist.
B00004D3C1|4.0|Late 70's punk rock like The Dead Boys and The Damned live on through Fu Manchu. Even the production sounds like it was recorded by Stiv Bators. This album contains lots of nasty riffs and appropriately a cover of Devo's \\"Freedom of Choice\\" <br />
B00000272N|5.0|im a huge alice fan and this may be my favorite cd at the moment.  every track on here kicks ass, \\"we die young\\" is probably my favorite right now. <br /> <br />if you like rock music you need this cd in your collection, theres no way around that fact.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I saw \\"M&C\\" in theaters last year, and I thought it was good (particularly the Galapagos scenes) but I was a little overwhelmed by the plot, the politics, the naval terminology and the length.  I thought, \\"Nice, but I'm not sure if I care.\\"  <br /> <br />But recently I caught it during a showing on HBO, on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon and watching it was like a completely different experience for me.  It's actually far less opaque than I first thought it was -- it's a carefully measured yarn -- and I'm not sure what made me enjoy more than before, if it was the comfortable home setting or the repeat viewing or the fact that its 2.40:1 aspect ratio had been pared down to 1.33 (I'm a complete purist when it comes to watching widescreen movies in letterboxed format but... I'm afraid to say that the pan-and-scanning may have scaled the movie back to a less intimidating level for me; and I did, however, immediately buy a used copy at Ballbuster and watch the movie again in its proper aspect ratio). <br /> <br />Whatever the reasons, I'm now a big of the movie and although earlier I'd thought Peter Weir was just doing a quick paycheck action movie, I see now how complicated a feat the movie was in terms of condensing the material and the logistics of filming large boats with a large crew in lots of different locations.  It's amazing he was able to inject so much heart and intelligence into such a complicated project. <br /> <br />Prior to my second viewing, I would've been in the camp that complained about the length but now I see it's actually not that long -- two hours and change.  I think the density of plot and action make it seem longer than it actually is and for people who didn't like it the first time round, I recommend they watch it a lazy, rainy day when they don't have to be anywhere and can sit back and snack and enjoy a nice long novel of a movie.  Like other long, authoritative movies -- \\"The Great Escape,\\" \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"The Good, the Bad and theUgly,\\" \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" \\"Rio Bravo\\" and \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" -- \\"Master and Commander\\" is one of those movies.
B00023B1LC|4.0|This movie is not classic, but it is really good. Mind-boggling action, mind-boggling story make this movie a good one for ages 15+. The DVD is great too, with both the orginial theatrical version and the extended edition with the alternate ending and alternate opening edited back in to the movie.

B00012FXAE|5.0|I give 4 1/2 stars for the theatrical version, 5 stars for the special edition and 5 for the DVD. Here are the new scenes added in for the special edition: <br /> <br />Chapter 4: The Park <br /> <br />This new scene shows Ripley sitting down for a while and Carter Burke comes to talk to Ripley about her upcoming meeting about the fact that she destroyed the Nostromo for what the people going to be at the meeting think for reasons unknown. Ripley asks about her daughter, finding out that she died two years ago at the age of 66.  <br /> <br />Chapter 5: Inquest <br /> <br />This extended scene of the meeting shows Van Lewen sentencing Ripley to psychiatric probation and suspending her warrant officer license. <br /> <br />Chapter 6: LV-426 <br /> <br />This new scene has new characters in it, and it shows the families at LV-426 working. <br /> <br />Chapter 7: The Big Score  <br /> <br />This new scene fully introduces Newt's family. Newt, her brother Timmy and her parents drive around in their space car (not sure what it is called, but it's a guess) and they find the Alien ship that was in the first Alien movie. Newt's parents go and look the area over, and Newt's father comes back with a facehugger attached to his face. <br /> <br />Chapter 8: Home Alone <br /> <br />This extended scene is an extended conversation between Lieutenant Gorman, Burke and Ripley. <br /> <br />Chapter 10: Sulaco <br /> <br />This new scene is the uncut version of the introduction the Sulaco. <br /> <br />Chapter 14: Express Elevator to Hell <br /> <br />This extended scene shows Hudson bragging about all the weapons the Marines have. <br /> <br />Chapter 15: Arrival <br /> <br />This extended scene shows Hudson and Vasquez's radar detecting a lifeform inside. When they go inside where the lifeform is, and it is only a mouse. <br /> <br />Chapter 16: Memories <br /> <br />This extended scene first shows Ripley, Gorman and Burke entering the complex. Then, Ripley hesitiates for a moment. <br /> <br />Chapter 26: Barricade <br /> <br />Hicks reveals everything that survived from the wreckage of the Sulaco dropship. And they plan where to put the sentry guns <br /> <br />Chapter 27: A Mother's Love <br /> <br />This extended scene shows more dialogue between Ripley and Newt. <br /> <br />Chapter 28: Speculation <br /> <br />This extended scene shows Hudson making up an \\"ant\\" theory. <br /> <br />Chapter 29: The Tunnel <br /> <br />This new scene shows the sentry guns in the tunnel firing and killing the Aliens.  <br /> <br />Chapter 31: The Corridor <br /> <br />This extended scene first shows the other sentry guns unloading onto the Aliens. <br /> <br />Chapter 37: Ripley's Promise <br /> <br />This extended scene shows Ripley and Hicks exchanging first names. <br /> <br />
0064407667|4.0|\\"The books for children are written just like the books for adults, only better.\\" I don't remember who said that, but it certainly appears to be true that a good book for children must obey the rules of being a good book for adults. <br /> <br />Which this book doesn't obey, at the first glance. <br /> <br />Unless you look a little deeper. Perhaps this book is not for children \\"to pick up and read\\", but it is rather a children's book for adults, which can also be enjoyed by children. In other words, perhaps readers (adults) must broaden their minds and see this series as something beyond a mere children's books series. And if the book clears as a good children's book for adults, it may also clear as a good book for children. <br /> <br />If this sounds confusing, consider Shrek 2. It is a children's cartoon for adults (i.e., it is not an adult cartoon... no, it is a cartoon having elements of children's cartoon, but it is designated for adults). Children, however, also enjoy it, but perhaps for some other reasons (which is a totally different discussion). <br /> <br />Same principle may apply to Lemony Snicket's series. Perhaps people picking up the book expect to see a regular children's book, also possibly suitable for adults (like Harry Potter). But perhaps, it is a book intended for adults (masked by a children's book style and form) but also possibly enjoyable by children. <br /> <br />So, what can an adult anjoy in this book? Well, once you're past the stage of expecting a book for children also readable by adults, perhaps you can look for certain patterns in the series, etc. Possibly, the author's statement made prior to agreeing to write the series that he thinks majority of children's books are crap (or something like that) may start leading you in the right direction. <br /> <br />One good thing is, the book is rather lakonic (which means it, unlike this review, is short), so you can make up your mind quickly.
B00012FXB8|4.0|I give the theatrical release 3 stars, the more violent, profane and much more different special edition 3 1/2 stars and the DVD 5 stars! About 40 minutes was added into the movie, and they are described below:    Chapter 3: One Survivor?     This alternate scene is the reason why this version is so much different from the theatrical release. Since this scene was cut and replaced, Chapters 8 and 9 were also cut and replaced (only Chapter 9 was replaced)This is the orginial, alternate version of the prisoners discovering Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop.     Chapter 4: The Facts    This extended scene shows Dillon praying with the prisoners.    Chapter 7: A Possible Contagion    This extended scene has addtional dialogue between Ripley and Clemens.    Chapter 8: What Killed Babe?    It's so obvious why this scene was cut: because the orginial, alternate version of the finding of Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop was cut, too. Another reason why this was cut was because in the theatrical version, a facehugger attached itself to a dog. But, the special edition, you saw an ox, something you never saw in the theatrical release. This scene shows Murphy and Frank dragging a dead ox and talking about having sex with Ripley. Then, Murphy discovers the facehugger attached to the ox's face.    Chapter 9: A New Beginning    This alternate scene shows the Alien bursting out of the dead ox. In the theatrical release, the Alien bursts out of a living dog.     Chapter 10: Disharmony    This new scene shows Dillon handling the situation with Boggs and Rains about their dislike with Golic.     Chapter 11: New Temptations    This extended scene shows Dillon telling Ripley about their religion.    Chapter 12: Attracted In That Way    This extended scene has additional dialogue between Ripley and Clemens.    Chapter 13: Diced    This extended scene shows Ripley and Clemens talking more after sex and Murphy's graphic death.    Chapter 14: The Flight Recorder    This extended scene shows the prisoners going through the bowels of the refinery complex.    Chapter 15: High Priority    This extended scene has additonal dialogue between Clemens and Superintendent Andrews.    Chapter 18: Bishop Speaks    This extended scene shows a prisoner finding Golic and then, Dillon and other prisoners grabbing him.    Chapter 20: A Long, Sad Story    This extended/alternate scene begins with a different angle of Ripley asking Clemens if there is a way to escape.    Chapter 21: \\"It's Here!\\"    This is the uncut version of Clemens's horryfing and graphic death, with more footage of the Alien and Clemens being brutally killed. It also shows Dillon praying with the prisoners and then cussing at everyone.    Chapter 22: Who's in Charge?    This extended scene shows Aaron cleaning up the bloody mess that the Alien caused when it killed Andrews. There is also additional dialogue.    Chapter 24: Preparations    This extended scene shows more footage of the prisoners preparing their trap for the Alien.    Chapter 25: Wait for the Signal    This extended scene shows more killing of the prisoners when the trap misfires. Then, Junior, a prisoner who tried to rape Ripley earlier, heroically sacrifices himself to the Alien so the prisoners can trap the Alien.    Chapter 26: They Don't Want To Kill It    This new scene shows Aaron and Ripley talking about killing the Alien.    Chapter 27: Cut Loose    This new scene shows Golic begging Morse to set him free, and he finally does, then Golic hits Morse over the head unconcsious.    Chapter 28: Permission Denied    This new scene shows Ripley requesting permission from the company to terminate the Alien and they say \\"no\\".    Chapter 29:    This extended/alternate scene shows the deranged Golic going to where the Alien is, and he slits the guard's throat, opens the door and is instantly killed by the Alien.    Chapter 31: Better Get Prepared    This new scene shows Dillon and the prisoners having a meeting.    Chapter 32: A Classified CodeRipley tells Aaron that the Alien won't kill her.    Chapter 33:    This extended scene shows more dialogue between Ripley and Dillon.    Chapter 35: Plan B    This extended/alternate scene has additonal dialogue by Ripley and the prisoners.    Chapter 36: One Chance    This alternate scene is the alternate version of the prisoners waiting for the plan to start.     Chapter 37: It Started    This extended scene shows a prisoner finding a bloody mess of another prisoner.    Chapter 38: Improvising    This extended scene shows Dillon telling Ripley that they are \\"Improvising\\".    Chapter 42: Never Trust a Bishop    This extended scene has additional dialogue between Bishop II and Ripley.    Chapter 43: Ripley's Choice    This extended/alternate scene shows Ripley hesitating for a moment before she falls. And, a different shot of Ripley falling into the lava, without the Alien Queen bursting out of her.    The Special Edition is more violent and profane, yet it makes more sense because an Alien that size could NEVER burst out of a dog, but it could burst out of an ox.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Now if you ask me, and many history buffs and moving picture aficionados do quite often, then this here moving picture is worth missing if you have the option. On the other hand, if you ain't in a position to opt out of seeing it (like the scene in Clockwork Orange when they force that feller to watch movies by clamping his eye lids open) then it ain't quite as horrible as some folk say.    December 7th is the Day of Infamy and I can see why. Pearl Harbor was a real mess and even if you don't buy in to the assertion that it was a 100% surprise, i.e. that FDR was somehow in the know before the bombs started falling) then you ought to just watch this moving picture (assuming you don't opt out) and see it as another Hollywood product and not a historical documentary. I reckon the only redeeming part of the thing is the special effects, which are pretty good. They got some shorts of bombs falling and the like that will make you scratch your noggin and wonder how in the world they were able to create that image. Otherwise, the acting is flat and the dialogue is uninteresting. Kind of like eavesdropping in on a couple of young love birds at the local Dairy Queen... what they have to say ain't interesting to anybody else so why would anybody else bother to listen?    I ain't particularly a fan of Ben Affleck (nee Benjamin Geza Affleck) because I don't see that he has any redeeming skills as an actor, kind of like that Tom Cruise (nee Thomas Cruise Mapother IV) feller. He was exceptionally disappointing in Gigli, but as Shannon Hamilton in Mallrats he actually shone as a luminary thespian. This here film may be Kate Beckinsale's (nee Kate Beckinsale Loe) finest moment - but I will conceed extra points to her part in The Last Days of Disco as being particularly enthralling.    Junior liked the bomb scenes and the aeroplanes, and the twins liked the mushy stuff, but me and Mama ended up getting up and going out to the side yard and sitting in the shade watching the pig root around in the sty while we had some cool adult refreshment. I ain't too sure how the moving picture concluded, but I know that in real life the conclusion of the war was that the Allies won.
B000001G53|2.0|Here we have the usual late Karajan fare: sleek & glossy without any underlying dramatic integirity. Parsifal, at least from a physical viewpoint, is one of the most undramatic stageworks ever created and Karajan exploits this to such effect that we may feel as if we are listening to an oratorio at times, he robs any passion from this work in his quest for ultimate musical sound. Not only do the dramatic moments suffer, but the relationships between characters falls apart as well, Parsifal seems to have made no voyage of self discovery throughout this opera, from the moment he appears in act one to the final scene, Karajan's conducting seems to make it as if everything just falls into place, sort of like \\"Oh, he has learned compassion through suffering, huh.\\" or \\"Here's your Spear, I'm gonna be king of the Grail now.\\" In the end one gets the feeling that at the centre this Parsifal is hollow, as pretty but empty as Klingsor's flower-women.  <br /> <br /> The singing is generally fine though, the only real standout is Moll's Gurnemanz, the only singer that tries to find meaning in the words. Hofmann's Parsifal is sadly lacking in any really appealing vocal quality, sounding ugly & unfocused at times. Vejzovic's Kundry is just downright odd: vocally unbalanced & not even trying to get under the skin of her character, which is a pity. Kundry seems to be (or to me at least) the most three dimensional character in the opera & because of her (& Hofmann) the big crux of the opera in act two doesn't make much sense. Amfortas lies easily on van Dam's voice, but any anguish projected seems too genteel & reserved to project the King's agony. Nimsgern is probably the most bland Klingsor ever recorded. (Well, von Kannen for Barenboim probably gives him a run for his money in that aspect) The chorus is top notch & I can find no fault with their performance.  <br /> <br /> There are a few good spots, but these are too few & far between to make this recording a serious contender for your cash. The prelude to act one is one of the best I have ever heard, as well as the flower-women's chorus in act two. The funeral march for Titurel in act three actually portrays a sense of impending doom & near hysteria, and kudos for that. The final moments (choral only) of the opera have such an appealing ethereal quality that is breathtaking. Unfortunately, all this can't reedem this overblown orchestral monstrosity that Karajan conjures up.  <br /> <br /> If you want Parsifal, I strongly recommend either the '62 Knappertsbusch on Phillips. Or the Solti recording, both which are far superior to this nonsense.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The sound on this is exceptional. It is HDCD encoded.  HDCD is effectively 20 bit encoding, not 16 bit, which is the CD standard. DVD-A is true 24 bit. DVD-A seems to add a touch of depth over HDCD, but frankly, I can hardly tell the difference between the HDCD and DVD-A layers of this set. Both are a welcome improvement over the origial CD versions, in part because of the advanced technology, but also because the tracks were impeccably remastered thanks to Neil Young's commitment to getting as close to true analog sound as possible with a digital medium. Neil Young is apparently a supporter of HDCD and DVD-A, and has personally supervised the remastering of the Buffalo Springfield recordings in HDCD. The beauty of HDCD is that it is fully compatible with all CD and all DVD players; DVD-A will play satisfactorily in almost all DVD players, but will play in full 24-bit hi-res only on DVD-A enabled players. Because the Pacific Microsonics chip used to master in HDCD is so good, almost everything recorded in HDCD sounds better. However, technically, to get the extra bits that HDCD offers you need a player with an HDCD encoder. Denon makes one for about $299 (DCM 380). SACD is Sony's one-bit approach to high def mastering and is equal in quality to DVD-A. However, all of Sony's affordable players are SACD/CD only, apparently because it doesn't want to support the competing DVD-A technology. Since there is still so little hi-def stuff out there in any format, my advice is don't saddle yourself with an SACD only machine. Toshiba and Pioneer both make inexpensive machines &lt;$150 that play both SACD and DVD-A (but alas, do not include and HDCD decoder). I wonder if the commenter who claims to have compared the HDCD sound with the DVD-A sound using a Sony player was really listening to the DVD-A layer. The reason I wonder is that, as I said above, Sony does not support DVD-A. However, it's possible that high-end Sony's might have both. I know the low-end ones that I can afford do not.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Iron Maiden have always gone out of their way to give something extra to their loyal fans. But this time, they've REALLY outdone themselves! The DVD w/ all the extras is something like 5 hours(!!!) long! You have some awesome live footage with Paul Di'Anno on vox & Clive Burr on drums as well as all the promo videos from this era (1980-1983) and some rare never before seen footage from these years. Really great hearing all those early songs when the band was still hungry for success & proving themselves! Of course, the stuff with Bruce Dickinson & Nicko McBrain is nothing less of speactacular either! The best part is the 90 minute documentary where they interview band members past & present (even people that have played before the first album was released!), management, record company execs, promoters, etc. It's just the best DVD Maiden have EVER done! UP THE IRONS! ! ! !
B0000033P2|5.0|Trilogy was ELP's third studio album (fouth album overall, since Pictures at an Exhibition was recorded live). To me I thought this was an improvement over Tarkus. While Tarkus is highly regarded for its title track, side two (that is if you own the LP) got marred with some really uneven material (like \\"Are You Ready, Eddy?\\" which most can live without), Trilogy is a much more consistent offering. \\"The Endless Enigma Part 1\\" features Emerson's strange use of synth sounds, before he plays on some wind instrument called a Zoukra (because the album liner notes forgot to put a comma in between Zoukra and Moog III-C, you'd be wondering what a Zoukra Moog III-C was, but of course they're totally separate instruments, the Zoukra seems to be a double-reed instrument). This song is ELP all the way. \\"Fugue\\" is a totally piano-oriented piece before concluding with \\"The Endless Enigma Part 2\\" which features tubular bells (courtesy of Carl Palmer) and more great Moog synth from Emerson, before the vocal theme concludes the song. Lake then gives us one of his finest acoustic pieces, \\"From the Beginning\\". It's not unlike \\"Lucky Man\\" because it's more folk-rock, and it too ends with synth effects, not to mention receiving plenty of FM radio airplay. \\"The Sheriff\\" is one of the band's attempt at humor (like they did with \\"Jeremy Bender\\" off Tarkus), with Emerson using ragtime piano, with lyrics dealing with an Old West theme. \\"Hoedown\\" is a band's take on Aaron Copland (something they would do five years later with another of his compositions, \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\"), showing Emerson's talents on organ and synthesizer. The title track starts off as a piano-oriented ballad, but that's only the first couple minutes, as the rest of the cut features a length, intense jam on Emerson's Moog. \\"Living Sin\\" is a rocking piece that's reminiscent of \\"Knife Edge\\", while \\"Abbadon's Bolero\\" isn't the band's take on Ravel, but rather just the bolero style, using the beat, and starting off the music quietly and building up to a loud climax. It starts off with quiet organ, and it build up more and more to start including synths, and Emerson starts overlaying the synths more and more to reach a wonderful climax. Great piece. And if you thought Trilogy was great, even better things were to come with Brain Salad Surgery. There is no doubt Trilogy is recommended to those who enjoy ELP.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Honestly when I first heard some of the samples from the cd, I thought it would not be one of their better albums, however, I now have an entirely different opinion of it. It is most definately one of their best works; if not, the best. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who's a Rammstein fan, Megaherz fan, Eisbrecher fan, Korn fan, Slipknot fan, etc.
B0002S94OS|4.0|I think this album is a good example of what they should call 'new metal' (not nu-metal): keeping the basis of the classic metal but adapted to the days we are living.<br /><br />'Ashes of the Wake' is one of the best metal albums of 2004, and of course, production has a lot to do with this. It is the most clear difference between this and the first two albums by Lamb of God.<br /><br />'Blood of the Scribe', 'Hourglass', 'What I've Become', 'Ashes of the Wake' and the killer 'Laid to Rest' are my favourite songs in this record.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|Usually on my business trips I take all Enigma albums on my iPod.  This one is NOT going to make it, its just flat.  Expect nothing like the old albums.  I still recall when I bought \\"Le Roi\\", I could not listen enough to it and I still listen it a lot to the day.  This album is definately not Enigma, more like a desperate attempt to fulfill the obligation they have to release new albums.  What a shame, they used to really kick arse.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|I did not see this when it originally aired on ABC on November 20th 1983 (too young), but I have to say watching it now for the first time I was pretty impressed.  With the movie that is, not the wimpy DVD, which has absolutely, no special features at all.  This movie was watched by close to half of the adult population of America!  That's phenomenal and you would think MGM could at least dig up some old commercials or news reports or something.  What about the Carl Sagen special that aired directly after the movie in which he compared nuclear war to \\"two men standing waist deep in gasoline; one with three matches, the other with five.\\"  I would love to see that.<br /><br />Shot in a very low-key fashion the movie opens with different people and families living their everyday lives in Kansas.  We get some doctors, a few farmers, a few college students and a soldier.  In the background of all these stories we hear news reports on televisions and radios talking about trouble in Europe between Germany and Russia.  Things begin to escalate and next thing you know giant ICBM's are blasting out of the ground.  Everybody goes completely nuts.<br /><br />Then....BOOM!  The scenes of the missiles hitting had my eyes bugging out like a cartoon.  I couldn't believe it.  Horses blowing up.  Cows.  Kids.  Everybody's getting cooked.  The pitch-black clouds looked absolutely evil.<br /><br />The survivors (I personally believe that there will be very, very few survivors) do not have four arms and venom shooting tentacles like I had hoped, but they are pretty sick and only get sicker.  By the end everybody who's still alive looks like zombies.<br /><br />The aftermath part of the movie kinda drug a little, but I still found two scenes especially shocking.  One was were this man gets shot in the back and then the guy who shot him starts sharpening his knife!  The other is toward the very end when it shows the body of a burnt child impaled on a piece of rebar!  Yikes!  As out of control as the FCC is now I'm not even sure ABC could show this movie today.<br /><br />While researching for this review I came across some other nuclear war movies.  I've only seen a few, but I will eventually review them all...WWIII (great movie, would love to see again), MIRACLE MILE (very good), THREADS, TESTAMENT, FAIL-SAFE, ON THE BEACH, AFTERMATH, THE QUIET EARTH, WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, THE WAR GAME.<br /><br />D: Nicholas Meyer (STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, TIME AFTER TIME)<br /><br />S: Edward Hume (TWO MINUTE WARNING, THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO)<br /><br />Dr. Russell Oakes - Jason Robards (MAGNOLIA, A BOY AND HIS DOG)<br /><br />Stephen Klein - Steve Guttenberg (SHORT CIRCUIT, POLICE ACADEMY 1-4)<br /><br /> Joe Huxley - John Lithgow (KINSEY, ORANGE COUNTY)t of control as the FCC is now I'm not even sure ABC could show this movie today. <br /> <br />While researching for this review I came across some other nuclear war movies.

B000060MMI|5.0|This is an awesome album.  I've never thought of myself as a punk music lover.  I love anything up tempto and this CD is just that.  I commute 75 miles to work one way and when I start to fall a sleep I just put this CD in and I'm intently awake.  It's better than caffine!!  I can listen to it over and over again and it doesn't get old. I've listened to a few of the other bands and albums the reviewers have mentioned but can not find another like this -Totally high energy (even the balleds.)  It's a great buy!
B00000DHR0|5.0|I first purchased this CD in Dec. 1998 upon release, it has become a family favorite. Truly this is the best Christmas album in a long time- it is touching, upbeat, traditional, world music mix all at the same time. Her absolutely clear voice sounds like that of angels. 'The Prayer' with Andrea Bocelli is pure brilliance, 'Another Year Has Gone By' is another favorite cut, 'I'm Your Angel' Duet is awesome! If you are looking for the beauty of Christmas, it is right here. A beautiful gift for family and friends. Thank You Celine, the holidays would not be the same without this!
1400049628|2.0|I must say, I felt kind of ripped off after buying this book. Thought it would be a bit more satirical, but it was very repetitive. Seeing as It was more \\"informative\\" I would have expected little things like no contradictions in the text (Fire example: Build A fire to scare away the zombies; earlier- zombies do not notice fire.) I dunno... Good conversational piece?
B000002IMG|5.0|A metal thrash classic, almost unbelievable, the only metal act ever to equal an album of quality similar to peace sells of megadeth. <br /> <br />10/10 the best metal album ive heard in years

6301744160|5.0|Mr. Grant (Stephen Boyd) is driven to a secret location.  Once there, he is given instructions by General Carter (Edmund O'Brien, DOA [1950]).  An important government scientist has a clot inside his brain.  The surgery can only be done by sending a small submarine-line craft inside the human body along with five people.  Mr. Grant, Cora (Raquel Welch), Dr. Duval (Arthur Kennedy), Dr. Michaels (Donald Pleasence) and Skipper (William Redfield).  They will shrink down to a minute size and medically enter the head.  Now inside the human body and traveling through the artery and ther secret passageways, they must get to the man's brain to get the clot.  They must not go to the heart.  It would be dangerous.  But, it looks like they will have too.  They also have to find a way to get out of the live body too.<br /> James Brolin is a technician.  VHS shown in standard format.
B000069AUI|1.0|I hesitated buying an album from this band because I just didn't trust the hype.  But after hearing a couple of songs and reading these reviews, I relented.  Radiohead? Come on.  I know Radiohead and they are NO Radiohead.  I was going to try to listen to this CD a second time, (not having made it all the way through it the first time)but I just can't bring myself to do it yet.  Mind you, this is only after one listen, but it seemed like every song had the same formula.  Acoustic guitar, piano voice.  Where's the bass and drums?  I'll try it again someday, and if somehow I start to get it I'll change my review, but for now, my advice...don't fall for it.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|The first entry in what has been dubbed, a couple of years after \\"Pitch Black\\"'s release, the \\"Chronicles Of Riddick\\" series, this sci-fi/action/horror hybrid features more of an ensemble cast of characters than its 2004 \\"Chronicles\\" theatrical sequel, which focuses almost entirely around Vin Diesel's Riddick character.  Here, the other characters take more active roles, though Riddick is still the central figure, a convicted mass killer who it's insinuated, more between the lines than anything, may have more extenuating circumstances in his history than would appear on the surface. <br /> <br />   The thrust of the movie is about a deep-sleep passenger spaceship crashlanding on an arid, out-of-the-way planet, stranding Riddick, the bounty hunter who brought him in, and about a dozen other survivors.  The world has 3 suns, leaving it in almost perpetual daylight, and it's here that the cinematography and other technical aspects really shine, making the world look quite alien; as the suns make their way across the sky a different light is prominent at different times, casting the world in different colors as time progresses, with the ghostlike all-encompassing 'white' stage most memorable.  Even if you're not into the action and the monsters and the rest of the movie, fans who appreciate visual magnificence in cinema have got to see this one just for the sunlight effects on the bone-laden terrain. <br /> <br />    It's not Always daylight though; once every 22 years the planets and suns aligh for a prolonged eclipse, at which point come the monsters from under the ground, every bit as ferociously impressive as the title beasts in \\"Aliens\\" or \\"Predator\\", and almost stealing the show completely if not for the impressive, way-beyond-stereotypical characterizations of the endangered survivors.  Great action, superior suspense, top-tier performances (including arguably Diesel's best to date) and innovative special effects set this one up near the top of the pile in thecrowded field of sci-fi actioneers.  Its only real weakness is a rather heavy reliance on coincidence, which given the aforementioned strengths is certainly tolerable.  Chalk it up to fate anyway, given \\"Chronicles\\"'s bringing into the flow a heavy dose of fate and destiny anyway.  Highly recommended.
B000060P79|5.0|one of my favorite rock cd's(even though i like rap).      definitly buy his if u dont have this!!!!!!    hot cover******    favorite songs:  -I'd do anything  -Addicted-Waz up with saying   -Perfect  -I'm A Kid    the other songs are really good toooooo.
B0002OERI0|5.0|i've never really listened to green day before but i love this album.  at first, i was hesitant to buy it because i thought the first song \\"american idiot\\", which is played on the radio all the time,was just okay.  but all the other songs totally blew me away.  i definitely don't think that you have to be a big green day fan to enjoy this album -- i would definitely vote it best album and/or record of the year (it's nominated for the grammy in both categories).
B00005JMXX|3.0|Interesting movie but too many factual inaccuracies. Anyone living in Canada knows that you can't go outside without your face covered when it is -20 degrees, let alone -120!
B0002VEXUA|4.0|This is a lot better than some of the other Oasis DVDs. Their first album is highly regarded. There are no weak songs. Their later albums don't hold up as well. It does seem like a lot if you have the albums, have seen Live Forever, have read Q Magazine and NME for the past ten years, and read Britpop by John Harris, like I have. There is not much new. I am not the biggest Oasis either. But I didn't mind because I haven't heard this record in five years. People say that \\"Live Forever\\" is the best songs and this album is the best debut album of all time.
B00011RPB0|5.0|One thing I've learned is that people tend to dislike make-it-up-yourself endings. They like clear-cut, straight to the point, action or at least scenes that involve actual speech. The movie is something you get on your own. YOU make up what happened in the end.  YOU figure out what the meaning is on those dozen scenes when no speech is maintained. This is really a movie that makes you think.  <br />Great feats this movie pulled off-Not much speech(people always talk alot these days. Refreshing to have little speech) Decide-the-ending feature, and best of all, it's about normal people, who have normal problems, who live in a normal city. Having something like that is like having a bloodless videogame, it's extremely rare. This is simply a spiritual, moving movie, where nothing happens but is still good.  <br />Should be watched at night on a vacation to get the most spirituality out of it.
B00007BK2N|5.0|I have watched this film at least ten times and it holds up. It holds up even if you don't know who New Order or Happy Monday are. It contains many themes that are present in Michael Winterbottom's previous films. Shirley Henderson is great in a minor part. It's an entertaining film throughout. I enjoy watching all the director commentaries, with Tony Wilson and Steve Coogan. Some commentaries are deadly dull. These are as entertaining as the film itself. I guess a bunch of Joy Division fans and Happy Monday fans came to see this one. It is more about a time in Manchester. It is about a city and the music. There is supposed to be a real Joy Division film with Jude Law as Ian Curtis. That should be good and more what people seem to want. I spoke to Steve Diggle of The Buzzcocks and he thought the film wasn't about punk at all. It was about two minutes about 1976-1978.
B000002UAR|5.0|Though most musicologists' lists seem to laud \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" as the Beatles' finest recording, the argument can be made that its timelessness, songwriting genius, and arrangements are actually inferior to \\"Rubber Soul\\" and my favorite, \\"Revolver\\". Like the Beatles'image itself, it's easy for the average listener to get lost in Sgt. Pepper's hype on the way to the substance. Not so with \\"Revolver\\". From the opening count-in to \\"Taxman\\", to the gorgeous melody of \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\", to the hilarity of \\"Yellow Submarine\\", to the guitar army of \\"She Said, She Said\\", and to the joyous chorus of \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\", this is the most complete artistic statement made by the Beatles AS A GROUP during the height of their powers and before the weight of being the Beatles caught up with them. That this LP contains distinctly Lennon songs versus distinctly McCartney songs while still arranged and performed as a band gives it the edge over \\"Rubber Soul\\". That they recorded it while not staring daggers into one another gives it the edge over \\"The Beatles\\"(White Album) and \\"Abbey Road\\". A must for all pop music collectors, and imperative if one is to be considered a Beatles fan.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I am a big fan of Monica Belucci but that didn't get me to see this film till a year later after it came out. It is a silly movie. Nothing realistic about it. Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew (1964) is a far superior film. I think you have a hard time trying to make a popular entertainment and trying to tell the truth simultaneously, because people will prefer fantasy and cliche over truth and beauty. It's telling that most people who bought this DVD also bought the Star Wars DVD. Star Wars must be one of the biggest myths of our time.
B000002KHF|5.0|It must be a drag artistically to have recorded your best-known work so early in your career. Van Morrison was 22 when he recorded \\"Moondance\\", the follow-up to the mind-blowing \\"Astral Weeks\\". From all accounts, Van the Man has a restless mind and spirit, hates to revisit the past too much, and feels somewhat imprisoned by this LP's success. To add insult upon injury, he doesn't even exclusively control the rights \\"...Weeks\\" and this disc. Nevertheless, about 99% of all musicians wish they had such problems. If there has ever been any doubt in anyone's mind about the Man's voice, listen to the casual epic \\"And it Stoned Me\\". If there has ever been a doubt as to his songwriting brilliance, listen to \\"Into the Mystic\\". If there has ever been any doubt as to his ability to create and pace and unending underlying theme, listen to the whole darned LP from first note to the last pulse of the last sound. Though Van the Man has been justifiably criticized for some less-than-worthy efforts and an occasional coast, the objective listener will be absolutely arrested by this record and more than convinced of its place in the history of pop music.
B0001CCXGG|4.0|Back when I saw my 1st G3 show with Satch, Vai and Eric Johnson, while I loved the performances, my main thought was, \\"If only they could get Yngwie on this tour...\\"  So imagine my joy when I found out that the Viking Chief was added as the 3rd guitarist for the most recent G3 US tour!  Of course, as the saying goes, \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\" <br /> <br />While the show, in its entirety, was fantastic (I saw the 2nd night show in Manhattan with guest performers John Petrucci and Neal Schon), this double CD DOES NOT reproduce a complete show.   The first disc is about 64 minutes while the 2nd disc with the \\"G3 Jam\\" is not even 30 minutes long!  They easily could've packed 40 more minutes of music onto this.  A 2CD set with one of the discs being under 30 minutes is ridiculous. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the album, as well as the DVD, jumbles the order of onstage appearance.  More on that in a bit. <br /> <br />First up is Joe Satriani. 21m 27s.  Same quality performance on other live releases of his, although he seems a little subdued.  Best track here is The Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing, which is also amazing to see live because of the off-kilter drumming required.  I'd recommend his Live In San Francisco album above this, as that is two full discs while here you only get 5 songs. <br /> <br />Next up is Steve Vai.  20m 6s.  Again, Vai always puts on a good performance and here is no different.  And, again, he seems a little laid back.  His performance of Whispering A Prayer is the best of the three (yep, 3) songs here - and was just nominated for a Grammy!  If you're looking for live Vai, pick-up Alive In An Ultra-World, or better yet, Live at the Astoria London with Tony MacAlpine on back-up guitar and keyboards! <br /> <br />Then comes Yngwie J. Malmsteen. 21m 52s.  Ripping right into blazing runs on Blitzkrieg, he's a house of fire through most of his set save for maybe the first minute or two of the Trilogy Suite.  His picking was not as clean as it should've been, I hate his use of delay effects, and I can live without his Joe-Cocker-with-strep-throat singing voice (on Red House), but man, what presence!  His performance here has a much more animated and vigorous sound than Satch and Vai; even the audience seems more responsive (and when I saw the show he got the same enthusiastic response from the sold out NYC crowd).  Here's where I have a nit to pick with whoever compiled the disc.  In reality, the show was opened by Yngwie, then Vai, and Satriani came on third.  Problem was, after Yngwie's lively start to the show, Vai and Satch's more relaxed sets made for a little unevenness in the three performances.  Apparently, someone decided that Yngwie's energy was better suited to the end of disc one, where its force leads right into the meat of the double disc set, the G3 Jam. <br /> <br />Here's what we were all waiting for, and, besides the aforementioned brevity, this is the one you'll be putting in your player over and over.  None of them are strong singers, but we don't listen to them for their voices, right?  As they trade off run after run, you can tell that Yngwie is the fastest of the three, but Satch and Vai have a bit more creativity in mixing things up and have more tricks in their repertoire.  PLEASE Yngwie, you're my favorite guitarist, just get some more variety in there while you're unleashing the fury, OK?   However, to those who are familiar with all three players, Satch and Vai playing with more diversity is no real surprise.  Thanks to a nice engineering job, all three guitars are clear and distinct - be sure to sit in the middle if your system is set up that way.  My favorite of the three jam songs is Neil Young's Rockin' in the Free World, but if you're more of a Hendrix fan the other two songs don't disappoint. <br /> <br />3 and a half stars for the individual performances, 2 for the chintzy length, and 5 for the jam gives 3 and and a half stars overall (rounded up to 4, stupid Amazon - geta fractional-star availability in the rating system, will ya'?)
B0001AP12G|2.0|Why does everyone praise Kanye West like he's the best thing to happen to hip-hop since Public Enemy? Sure, he's a decent enough producer (by mainstream standards anyway); he occassionally comes up with an interesting message (ex. Jesus Walks, All Falls Down); and he doesn't devote all his songs to the tired mainstream topics of sex and money (whoopie-frickin-doo). All well and good, but for one important thing:<br /><br />THE MAN CANNOT RAP. Seriously. His delivery and flow are third-rate at best. Every guest rapper on the album outshines him, including the overrated Jay-Z. Sure, he's vastly better than the likes of 50 Cent and Lil' John, but that's not impressive since a 5th grader with Down Syndrome could outperform the aforementioned \\"artists.\\" Kanye even raps about the fact that his jaw is wired shut on one track. Problem is, I don't think he had that wire removed for the entirety of the album.<br /><br />And then you have the fact that some wags seems to hail Kanye as \\"underground\\" or whatever. Hello?!?! He's on f--king MTV and on Clearchannel! He's produced a single for Alicia Keys, for crying out loud! He was on the VMA's (takes very little to be a standout perfomer there)! All he did was popularize what was already done long before by rap artists working outside the mainstream. Another peeve of mine regarding Kanye is his seeming aversion to a college education, as evidenced by some of the skits. Which all in all is not surprising given the title of the album, but why? It just reinforces the stereotype that higher education is a lost cause, furthering the message to America that it's perfectly okay to celebrate stupidity. Whether it's tongue-in-cheek or not, I still find it kind of irresponsible. Not every kid out there can make it in the music business, and it's rather naive to preach that message. Also annoying is the fact that he will slam the whole \\"bling 'n' bi-ches\\" mentality on some tracks, but then turns around and raps about the exact same thing (minus the violence). How's that for staying on message?<br /><br />Granted this isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, and the production and some of the lyrics are respectable. Which means it earns two stars--the badge of mediocrity. Overall there's much better hip-hop, underground or otherwise, out there. Try Mr. Lif, M.F. Doom, Madlib, El-P, Aesop Rock, and Mos Def. Kanye simply can't compare.thing (minus the violence).

B00004Z459|4.0|OK, I understand that not everyone likes this band. That's cool, everyone's entitled to their own opinions. That's fine. But when you start bashing this CD just because it doesn't conform what you see as \\"a good genre\\", here's some info and advice.     I like metal, heavy metal, nu-metal, and I'm not huge on rap, but it's kinda cool. What annoys me is that a lot of the people who have reviewed this album have overlooked the simple fact that good music does not always mean one single genre or one single preference. Linkin Park is definitely not a very \\"heavy\\" album, compared to many bands. I like Slipknot, Slayer, Korn, Mushroom Head, Rob Zombie, Shadows Fall, Marylin Manson, and many many other bands that range from sort-of-heavy to screaming-raging-bashing-your-head-against-the-wall music.     Anyway, my point is, that instead of complaining about this album not being heavy enough, try and respect the fact that they are a very unique combination of music genres, from hard-core to rap to electronica. I didn't say \\"enjoy\\" I said \\"respect.\\" There's a difference.    I really appreciate their music because of the lyrics for one. Some say it's not original enough or \\"stupid\\" but I can connect to them. Secondly, the lyrics help me get out anger. Many times I feel like blowing up, but I can listen to this music and it helps me get some frustration out.    I rated this album 4 stars because the thing I dislike about it is that to my dismay, it's sounded a LITTLE bit boy-bandish to me. It's also not as heavy as a lot of the stuff I listen to.    Anyway, that's my two cents.     [...]
014043786X|5.0|There are few better detectives in fiction than Sherlock Holmes.  And there is no Holmes novel better than \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\"  Granted, Doyle may have been at his best when penning his short stories, but of his four novels starring Holmes, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is easily his best, and arguably among the best-ever novel-length murder mysteries.  Published in 1902, Holmes wrote \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" after he had published his first two collections of short stories, and when his pen was producing Sherlock Holmes at his best.<br /><br />The adventure starts when Sir Charles Baskerville, owner of the Baskerville mansion, meets an untimely death from a heart attack, apparently the result of his terror while faced with a huge hound.  An old Baskerville family legend testified to a supernatural and ghostly hound that tormented the family, and Charles' death appears to confirm local gossip that the hound is alive and roaming the moors.  When Sir Charles' only living relative and heir of his fortune, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives at Baskerville Hall, his life too appears to be threatened.  Who is following him, who is stealing his boots, and who is the author of a warning note? To protect Sir Henry and unravel the mystery, Dr. James Mortimer, friend of the late Sir Charles, obtains the involvement of Holmes and his loyal sidekick Dr. Watson.  While he does not expressly discount supernatural involvement, Holmes uses the ruthless application of logic and reason to find the real solution to the mystery.<br /><br />The plot thickens as an escaped convict hiding on the moor joins the action.  Homes must uncover the masks behind a cast of mysterious characters, including the caretakers Mr. & Mrs Barrymore, the amateur astronomer Mr. Frankland and his daughter Laura Lyons, and the botanist Jack Stapleton and his sister Beryl.  With the appropriately chilling and melodromatic setting of the gloomy moor, the action increases with a thrilling finale, as Holmes uses Sir Henry himself as bait to bring the criminal out of hiding, and reveal the mystery behind the supernatural hound from hell.

B00063EMJ6|4.0|Like many fans here, I have a few misgivings about this collection.  But its still undeniably a solid set of incredible songs, thus the four star rating.  If you must have a single disk to encompass Neil's career, this is what you need.  Its main problem, besides the fact that its impossible to contrain a catalog like Neil's onto a single disk, is the fact that it is so skewed toward his early years.  The entire 80's and 90's have been reduced to two tracks.  Granted, most people won't miss the eighties, but the nineties have some of his best work. Maybe there's a volume 2 planned?   <br /> <br />Obviously old Neil heads don't need this, but curious types wanting an easy jumping on point will find it here.  You should also give consideration to the Decade collection though, which contains nearly all of these songs and many more besides.
068987474X|5.0|I haven't read the book but I just saw a little bit of both of the authors on Oprah and I know exactly what they're talking about!  When my husband and I first met (in our very early 20's), I was needy and clingy and I gave him an ultimatum - it's either your friends or it's me... and he chose his friends.  I know that makes him sound like a TOTAL JERK, but the truth was, he thought I was asking for too much and he was totally honest with me about it.  I went on to date other people and they never measured up to his level of honesty.  It was always one excuse after another.  They were saying that they were busy when they should have beeing saying that they just weren't that into me.  That gave me a newfound respect for my now-husband when we started to see each other again.  He had enough respect for BOTH OF US to be honest about how he really felt and now our entire relationship is built on that respect and honesty.  I also have a male friend that I wanted to give this advice to.  He's afraid of getting hurt and I want to let him know that if he finds a woman that he is interested in, he must treat her with respect and HONESTY and don't accept anything less in return.  If he finds that she is less than honest, she doesn't deserve his time and effort.  I think I'll buy this book for him!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a fan of Green Day for a very long time. Everything they put out is awesome and deserves praise. I was particularly drawn to this album because of the awesome single \\"American Idiot\\" because of Billie Joe's view of the country and its morals and beliefs and I could not help but say that I agree with and see what  he is talking about through the lyrics. So naturally I bought the album, and I was blown away by the whole thing. From start to finish this album is one of the best albums I have ever heard. It is supremely written. It is a masterpiece. It is definately one of the greatest albums ever written. Buy this album, you will not be dissapointed.

B000002KFJ|4.0|i hadnt heard much of sabbath until i got this cd in a store for seven bucks. and thats the best seven dollar cd i ever got. this cd opens with hole in the sky (4/5), probly one of the best opening tracks ever, then its goes from a soft and great acoustic riff of Dont Start(too late) into the heavy intro of Symptom of the Universe(5/5) which may soften later in the song a little but its just ozzy at his best and tony iommi as well, with a great solo in there. Megalomania (4.75/5) starts slow then gets heavy, this ones almost as great as symptom. the rest of the songs are still good, but not like the first four. the original cd, which i have, ends on Am I Going Insane? and i feel like im going insane that a song like thats on and ending an album like that. its not a bad song, it just doesnt fit in on here. i strongly suggest buying this one if you like sabbath or ozzy.

B00006LPER|5.0|This movie is unusual from the beginning. I was so transfixed when I first saw it in the theater that I went back three more times. This is unlike you will see from an American studio. The French, it seems, display more bravado when dealing with controversial topics. The story centers around Erika (played magnificently by Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher still being treated like a 12-year-old by her mother(Annie Girardot). Erika seems to derive all of her satisfaction in life by means of a piano. When a younger man shows interest in her, she at first, rebuffs him. You get the impression that Erika has never been involved in a relationship with a man before. The problem is, the man,Walter,(also magnificently played by Benoit Magimel), doesn't know what he's getting himself into. The object of his desire performs masochistic experiments on herself, even to the point of drawing blood. (This scene is omitted in the R Rated version.) After Erika has her student attacked she and Walter proceed to have perhaps, the most unusual sex scene you are ever to see on film. The story unravels with her revelation that she wants him to beat her. The catch, ironically enough,is that she doesn't want to be beaten, she wants to be loved. Everything comes to a head at the when Walter beats and rapes her. The apparent moral of this is: don't say anything you don't absolutely mean. And perhaps, be careful what you wish for. Walter, himself, also says something he ultimately doesn't mean. I found the ending unexpected when I first saw it, and I don't want to give it away. You will have to see it for yourself. Isabelle Huppert's performance in this picture is haunting. You sense her character's cold exterior, while simultaneously, sensing her inner vulnerability. The classical music of Franz Schubert is expertly placed in this movie. And it's effect is obvious when you see it. Both co-stars spent a year perfecting the music. There is nothing false about their performances. There are anumber of scenes in this movie that can turn your stomach. If you are looking for lighthearted fare you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are intrigued by something complex and daring, a movie that holds no punches, a movie that will have you talking about it after it is over, or if you appreciate first-rate acting, then I highly recommend this movie. It ranks at the very top of my list of favorites, and has made me into a lifelong devotee of Isabelle Huppert. The DVD includes a 20 minute interview with the star.
B0001I562I|4.0|A film by Randal Kleiser<br /><br />\\"Flight of the Navigator\\" is a wonderful movie that is good for the entire family.  It is the story of 12 year old David (Joey Cramer).  David is sent by his parents to look for his younger brother who is late coming home.  David searches in the woods, and after finding his brother, David falls off the edge of a small cliff into the valley below.  When he comes to, shortly after, he returns home only to find that someone else is living there and has no idea who he is.  David soon learns, from the police, that he was presumed dead 8 years prior.  After being reunited with his family we see that while everyone else has aged during the missing time, David remains the same age he was when he fell.  Meanwhile, NASA has located a spaceship which has crashed and they want to examine David to find out what he may know.<br /><br />David manages to escape in the spaceship and with the help of the robot Max (Paul Reubens), evades being recaptured by NASA scientists.  On the craft, David learns of what happened to him, why, and how he can rejoin his family.  Along the way he meets Carolyn (a young Sarah Jessica Parker), an intern at NASA and various alien creatures that look like Muppets.<br /><br />\\"Flight of the Navigator\\" is cute, funny, and an enjoyable movie.  It is appropriate for children of all ages.  Plus, it has muppet aliens.  How can you beat that?<br /><br />-Joe Sherry
B000000OSG|4.0|A very complex and moody album from GNR. Less rocking than its sister album Use Your Illusion 1, Illusions 2 finds GNR turning down the amps a tad, adding strings, piano solos, and songs dealing with bad relationships, war, failed friendships and how they want to put their pasts behind them. <br /> <br />Illusion 2 is a very uneven album over the 14tracks, there are still a few classic GNR cuts like You Could Be Mine, 14 Years and Pretty Tied Up. But the strong points of the album are the Axl epics Civil War, Breakdown, Estranged and Dont Cry. Guns was transforming into something different and these songs show how the band could in no way shape or form be grouped with Motley Crue or even Aerosmith for that matter. This would be the album to play for non GNR fans who thought the band was just about teased hair and drinking booze. <br /> <br />Strongest Cuts: Civil War, 14 Years, Yesterdays, Estranged, You Could Be Mine
B000679N96|5.0|Hey, it sounds great!  Despite Robert's overall disappointment with the whole thing originally(as stated in the liner notes).  Extras are worth the price.  It's missing Killing an Arab(does anyone remember what the song is actually about? Obviously not!).  That is the only complaint.  Nice to see World War on CD finally.  I wish Robert would quit slagging Lol(in the liner notes).  He was in the Cure for a long time and was part of the sound.  I look forward to the future reissues.  Hopefully they will be as nice, maybe less expensive like the Echo & the Bunnymen reissues.  But, if not still worth it!  I do however have one other small complaint, I do think the booklet was somewhat of a let down, maybe Robert could have actually written the liner notes rther than just his quotes.
B000000OSE|3.0|First and foremost the production is awful. This album would be amazing if it werent for the bells and whistles thrown on to everysong regardless if they needed them or not. For example Garden of Eden and Perfect Crime are two abosolutely brutal rock n roll songs that get lost in overdubs, echo effects and synths. Had they approached these songs in stripped down matter they would be classics. <br /> <br />This album is like GNR's version of Exile on Main Street or the White Album, its uneven and all over the place, Dust N' Bones, Dead Horse, Double Talkin Jive and Dont Damn Me are all strong rockers. Don't Cry is sappy and lame and the video didnt make sense. November Rain is a gorgeous epic that I believe is up there with Stairway and Bohemian Rhapsody. However cuts like Bad Obession, The Garden, Back of Bitch are all filler and make the album a chore to sit through without constantly changing songs. <br /> <br />The Best song on the album is Dont Damn Me where Axl spits out possibly his best lyrics ever. A song that Eminem should take note at, because Axl ranted against his critics in a more civil and intellectual matter and he did it over a decade ago. <br /> <br />Strongest Cuts: Dust N Bones, Dead Horse, Double Talkin Jive, November Rain, Dont Damn Me and Coma

B0006FO9J2|4.0|Man, there is no way to not buy this double DVD set by Maiden.... Ok, ok, they are doing anything they can to get some more money from their fans, but the fact is that the shows, interviews and everything else in this DVD are top notch. But, BEWARE!! You will feel nostalgic about how great the band was in the early days. They still are, but even the short show at the Rainbow, with Paul Di'anno, will put the ROCK IN RIO DVD to shame. The sound is better, the band is tighter, Harris seems possessed playing his bass, Di'anno is an amazing singer, Burr plays his drums with timing, power and perfection. The \\"Beast on The Road\\" show at Hammersmith is still better, and once again you'll notice how Clive was a gifted drummer. <br /> <br />The feature lenght doccummentary is also very good.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Its about time, too. After being postponed for about a year, the director's cut of DD is here. Two words, \\"LOVED IT\\"!!! <br /> <br />I just wanna get this one of my chest... How about the intro to the Kingpin??? I almost crapped my pants after I saw how brutal his intro was!!! They made him actually scarier than Bullseye, which the theatrical cut failed to do... Bulleye's dialogue was also trimmed up, and his intro was extended as well... <br /> <br />Overall content wise, it was even, with a major subplot included... Lots of loose ends get tied up... A few extra music cues here an there... I'm trading in my old version of DD...  <br />This is the version I'll keep hold of... Forgot to mention that its also rated R, lotta fights have that extra brutal crunch to them... Just remember, the Kingpin's intro. When he talks about what they used to do to the greek bodyguards back in the day... Turn that part up loud, and see for yourself what they used to do... Wink, Wink....
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I have all of Nightwish's albums, and though I truly love Century Child, I must say that Once is even better.  I'm a metal fan, and this is one of those rare metal albums that is very uplifting.  They have the same emotional passion and force as In Flames, but Tarja's vocals put Nightwish on a completely different playing field. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

This album is an American Classic, don't leave it out of ur CD collection!
B0057UA4CW|5.0|Lolita is Stanley Kubrick's 1962 adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel, with a screenplay by Nabokov himself (he receives sole writing credit, although Kubrick discarded much of his work). I have not read the novel, but I think few would argue how brave Kubrick was to take on this material during this time. He later admitted that had he realized how severe the censorship limitations would be, he wouldn't have made the film. I'm, for one, glad he did. Not only is this a brave, boundary pushing film but it shows early signs of Kubrick's trademark style and is a perfect example of how some filmmakers were able to brilliantly work past the censors. In an age where you can show anything on film, it takes a special creativity to show nothing and not let the audience notice. Furthermore, it's one of Kubrick's most emotionally dynamic films. Emotional content was not his strong suit as a director and he's been accused of making emotionless films. This is not the case with Lolita. While it has moments of comedy, it's a profoundly sad film.<br /><br />The film takes place in the 1950s and begins at the end. Humbert Humbert (James Mason), a 50-something British professor of French literature, arrives at the home of Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) and murders him. The film takes us back four years as Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, where he'll spend the summer before moving on to Beardsley College in the fall. In looking for a room to rent, he encounters Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), a lonely widower. At first, Humbert is put off by her flirtatious nature and only agrees to rent the room after eyeing her 14-year-old daughter, Dolores \\"Lolita\\" Haze (Sue Lyon). After Charlotte becomes infatuated with Humbert, she sends Lolita away to summer camp and professes her love for him. In an effort to remain close with Lolita, he marries Charlotte. Under tragic circumstances Charlotte dies suddenly, leaving Humbert to care for Lolita. He picks her up from camp and the two begin a sad odyssey across the United States, with the mysterious Clare Quilty always close by.<br /><br />With a running time of 2 hours and 33 minutes, Lolita is the rare kind of movie that races by while fitting in a substantial amount of plot. Much occurs in this film within the running time, but it never feels as long as it is. Because it's an adaptation of a celebrated piece of literature, this film would be remembered today regardless of the finished product. I don't believe it would be regarded as highly had any other director been behind it. Despite such rigid restrictions on the content of the story, Kubrick managed to create a special film that is both effective and affecting. In telling a story about a forbidden relationship between an adult and, essentially, a child, he managed to make a film that says all it needs to about the relationship and makes a stunning emotional impact, while never showing them being intimate in any way. Lolita kisses Humbert on the cheek in one scene and (if memory serves me) that kiss isn't even indicative of anything else. Lolita feels timeless, like a recent film rendered black and white. There are those with an aversion to old movies, but even that audience may be surprised by how modern this film seems. It is further proof of what a progressive, ingenious filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was.<br /><br />For all its brilliance as a film, Lolita can be watched just to see the coy, clever ways Kubrick got past the censors. For this story to be conveyed, cinematic trickery had to be employed often, as well as a (unheard of in today's studio system) reliance on the intelligence of the audience and their ability to read between the lines. After all, Humbert is a pedophile (perhaps a hebephile, more accurately) and the slightest implication of that, even today, will get your film in trouble. In one scene, Humbert is embracing Charlotte and they fall onto her bed. His eyes wander and a picture on her nightstand of Lolita comes into the foreground. In other scenes, the screen fades to black after some envelope-pushing dialogue. This effect is utilized a fair amount, but the lines and looks they were able to get past the censors remain surprising.<br /><br />Lolita, the film, the story, really toys with the morals of the viewer in the way it manipulates you to sympathize with some thoroughly immoral people. Humbert is a rather despicable character who only grows more so as the film progresses, yet he receives sympathy almost immediately. Winters' Mrs. Haze is the most sympathetic character, if not the true innocent of the story, and while your heart aches for her, you simultaneously pity Humbert's plight. Much of this owes to Mason's characterization of Humbert; all upper-class arrogance, betraying deep self-loathing. It was a brave move to accept this role and Mason is really quite good. Amusingly enough, he bears a passing resemblance to Richard Nixon and I wonder if this attribute has ever assisted his performance by way of audience sympathy or repulsion. Ultimately, it may be the way Lolita is portrayed that makes it easier to genuinely empathize with Humbert. Or, it may just be the generalized emotions that allow audiences to connect with hi; the genuine longing, the unrequited love, and the feeling of constantly being deceived by this woman/girl. Lolita is a \\"victim,\\" but in many ways she's the villain. Lyon, only fourteen when she played Lolita, gives a dynamic performance that is simultaneously naïve, cunning, innocent, and promiscuous. It's a mature, intelligent performance as evidenced by the interactions between Lyon and Mason. As smart as Humbert is, Lolita always seems to be one step ahead of him.<br /><br />With Humbert being the \\"hero\\" of the piece, Quilty almost comes to be the personification of evil. I'd guess due to his admiration for Peter Sellers, Kubrick greatly increased Quilty's role in the film. Sellers is remembered as a comedian, but his performance here is far from funny. There's something frightening about the rambling, accented portrayal. The disguises he uses in the film to torment Humbert show the seeds of Dr. Strangelove, but they come across as ominous rather than humorous. Maybe it's just the character itself, but Sellers makes him so creepy. The grip on atmosphere that Kubrick would carry through every one of his films, beginning with 2001, began to rear its head here. His mastery of creating an unbearably tense, uncomfortable feeling out of nothingness (an effect I can't explain or describe in any cinematic terms) started to become prevalent, most notably when Quilty is onscreen.<br /><br />The stunning, ageless, and beautiful black & white cinematography by Oswald Morris and the music by Nelson Riddle (particularly the cheery \\"Lolita Ya Ya' that becomes haunting in context) add to the atmosphere. It's really a beautiful film to see and hear. Especially in regards to Charlotte Haze, Kubrick successfully wanders into emotional territory without sacrificing that tone/style that he's so well-known for. The only flaw I find with the film (and it may be part of the novel) is Lolita and Humbert's final exchange, where she reveals Quilty's appearances to Humbert over the years. This makes those scenes feel like they lose some of their mystique. It also seems unnecessary as a viewer, as we know most of what she tells him. Obviously, it's essential that she tell him about Quilty but I found it unnecessary for her to reveal everything.<br /><br />Even today, Lolita is pretty taboo. Many would call it unthinkable to get an audience to sympathize with a character like Humbert, but Kubrick was the one director crazy enough to attempt it in such a conservative time. He succeeded and, despite being rushed in the end, it's another masterpiece from the great director. While much is hinted at or left to the imagination, the film leaves little to be desired. It's marvelously effective and its profound sadness makes it one of Kubrick's most emotional films. It's a startling accomplishment.<br /><br />GRADE: A
B0000028RR|5.0|Never have i been so engrossed in a band in my life.  Heres how the story begins i used to be into slipknot and korn and all that garbage music that makes you depressed, but after i listened once to this CD it all stopped.  I eventually threw away all that slipknot and Korn trash in the garbage and became obsessed with RATM. Never in the history of mankind could there have been such a good CD as this.  Those who say this gets 5 stars then you all actually know your stuff about music and i have to tip my hat to you.  THOSE THAT DO NOT THINK IT SHOULD GET 5 STARS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO LOOK JIMI HENDRIX IN THE FACE AND ALL THOSE GUYS THAT CREATED ROCK AND ROLL IN THE FACE AFTER YOU SAY THAT.  SECONDLY, LIMP BIZKIT IS PRALLY ONE OF THE WORST BANDS OUT THERE AND THEY ARE TERRIBLE, IF THEY WERE GOOD AT RAPPING THEY WOULD BE ZAKK DE LA ROCHA THE MAIN MAN, NO ONE ELSE. AND IF THEY HAD THEY CREATED RAP/ROCK THEN TELL ME LOOK AT THEM AND LOOK AT RAGE, NEVER HAS THERE BEEN SUCH WORDS TO EXPRESS OVER SUCH A GOOD ALBUM.  Tom Morello your the man.  Zack de la rocha, why did you leave???? please tell me why man???? <br />These guys have been by far the best band ever to set forth on the stage and anyone else that says someone else is better dont know anything about rock and roll and how rap is only good when its with rock and roll.   <br />In all seriousness i think it should get 10 out of 5 stars to show its recognition it deserves.  So many other bands out there now, For instance why rock and roll today is almost at rock bottom because of 3 things: 1 is Punk Rock music.  I wish that whoever invented it never even invented it at all.  2 is just plain rap and hip hop, thats been degrading rock and roll for a while and if there were other people that could rap like zack then rapping wouldnt actually have been so bad. 3 is hardcore music like slipknot and korn.  That stuff is just as bad as the other stuff.  I would in all honesty rather listen to pop music then those 3 garbage music. My only regret is that i never got to see RATM in concert, i feel i have failed at life from that.  Well not really but sorta. Tom Morello, Zack de la Rocha, and other guys that i cant remember but dont want to get their names wrong you could never have made this any better and please come back, please zack leave whatever your doing and go back to rage, tom forget audioslave, i mean there good but chris cornell just isnt zack.  Please regroup for me the most diehard rage against the machine fan in the world.  <br /> <br />For those of you who have not picked up this copy, within it is the best rock and roll cd known to man.  Please buy it and enjoy!!!!!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Matt Damon's reprisal of Jason Bourne in the rapidly paced \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" and Paul Greengrass' direction resulted in a winning combination.  Loosely based on Ludlum's classic trilogy, Bourne is framed for killing two CIA agents in a bungled operation orchestrated by CIA bigwig Pamela Landy played by stone faced Joan Allen.  Concomitantly, Bourne is marked for assassination, while miles away in India, by Karl Urban playing a Russian secret service agent working at the behest of a smarmy Russian oil magnate.  Still suffering from amnesia,  Bourne must determine why he is being marked by both the CIA and the Russians as he ambles through a travelogue of gorgeous European locales.<br /><br />The chaotic hand held camera work succeeded in adding to the excitement of the chase and pursuit scenes.  John Powell's musical score was also very effective in establishing the everchanging moods of the flick.  As in the prequel \\"The Bourne Identity\\" the movie contains an awesome auto chase scene which boggled my mind imagining how it was filmed.  Both Julia Stiles and Chris Cooper recreated their roles as CIA operatives from the prequel.

B0000026DJ|4.0|As most Oils fans and critics have noted, Peter Garrett and crew have a decidedly political bent.  Truth be told, most listeners (this one included) have very little knowledge of the Australian issues Garrett advocates, and as passionately as he voices them, most listeners won't seek to act upon these revelations.  Whether that makes the listener irresponsible or not is another topic.... <br /> <br />The appeal outside of Australia for Diesel and Dust lies in the universality of its themes.  \\"Put Down that Weapon\\" seems as relevant now as when it was recorded; \\"Sell My Soul\\" could relate to any listener and his/her temptations; \\"Sometimes\\" provides inspiration in the unrelenting human spirit.  Throw in seamless rockers \\"The Dead Heart\\", \\"Beds Are Burning\\" and \\"Dreamworld\\" and you have quite a gem of an album - arguably among the top 5 of the decade.  One could nitpick and argue that the live cuts from Scream in Blue of some of these songs are better (true); others may point out that quieter pieces from Blue Sky Mining such as \\"One Country\\" and \\"Antarctica\\" top the quieter ones from Diesel and Dust (ditto).  Nevertheless, the impact and appeal of Diesel and Dust are unrivaled in the Oils history.
B000660UN0|5.0|There is a greater sonic variety on this CD and a much more relaxed and fluid feel to the music.  Much more enjoyable to listen to than Me & Mr. Johnson.  The studio CD took a while to grow on me, and seemed a bit forced and artificial, but this one I like after a single listen.
B00005YUPO|2.0|I bought Baby Einstein's Neighborhood Animals for my now 10 month old.  She has enjoyed that DVD since she was about 7 months old and never grows tired of it.  She cannot take her eyes off the TV when it's on and squeals everytime a new animal comes on.  After that one was such a hit, we bought Baby Bach...it's okay, but not nearly the DVD that Neighborhood Animals is.  My baby's interest in Baby Bach is nothing compared to the other.  The objects used are just not as captivating and seem a little dull after the first couple of segments.  My husband and I agree that it's pretty boring compared to what we got used to.  Some babies may enjoy it, but this is the result at our house. Baby Galileo is a GREAT one too.
B000286S8S|5.0|I am from Brazil and here we just love Van Halen, they came here in 1982, the year I was born. But the fact is, this compilation is a perfect sum-up of all Van Halen Eras, the Gonzo days with DLR, great songs and attitude, and Sammy, well produced songs, well crafted, concise compsotions... both of them were great, they had different styles obviously but a Van Halen fan can aprecciate all of the good things about both of'em. I like them both.  <br />The new tracks are heavy, the tuning is very low, Eddie is probably digging these FX now but I believe a new album is gonna have great tunes. <br />For people who think Eddie's guitar style is easy, you could record a track of Eruption and show to us all, cause I've seen some fantastic guitar players playing and no one has the same picking as Eddie's, the guy's great and you can ask every great guitar player on the planet about that and Eruption is a masterpiece!
B00000099Y|5.0|if you want to know how good TOOL is, just get their albums. this review is commenting on some guy's statement that GODFLESH \\"stomps a muddy boot up TOOL's ass\\" or something like that. for those not in the know, GODFLESH uses drum machines. sorry, i will take danney carrey's superb drumming over a computer generated sound.
B000024D4R|5.0|Ah, where do I start.  I've been an avid fan of Pink Floyd for years now, and Animals is an album second to none...EVER.  Very 'moody' and feeling evoking.  These qualities shift from track to track and several times within each track.   <br />Dogs features a lyrical parallel to your average greedy SOB American, juxtaposed with Gilmour's greatest, sweetest solos ever.   <br />Pigs(Three Different Ones) is my favorite PF single track.  The lyrics are incredible.  Some parts of the beat, etc., of this song remind me of 'Have a Cigar' from 'Wish You Were Here'.  This is just a great track to blare out of your stereo...so many poignant(sp?) moments here. Funky cool bass riff, steady rockin drum beat, Gilmour does his thing, and to all the empty suits out there, \\"ha, ha charade you are\\".  What else can you ask for in a PF track?! <br />Sheep presents a futuristic aura with the organ playing in the beginning. I think it fits the idea of a sheep well, whatever that means.  Has some computer-generated reading that is hard to distinguish when listening to the song, but read the lyrics!  I was blown away.  Heavy rock parts with some flanged out guitar crashes and spacy effects. <br />Then, there's the Pigs of Wind I and II.  I think these are just there to lighten things up a bit with some plain acoustics and vocals. <br />This is my favorite album ever and it is a MUST for anyone even remotely attracted to other Floydian music.  GET IT
B000002J1U|5.0|This is a highly underrated album.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin is one of my favorite bands (in fact, it's topped only by Queen), and to me this is their best work.  From the hard, fast paced rock-out \\"Immigrant Song\\" to the crooning, ballad-esque \\"That's the Way\\", Led Zeppelin III has the perfect blend of songs that showcase Zeppelin's nearly limitless talent and versitility as a band.<br /><br />Best Songs:<br /><br />Tangerine- An underrated gem with a beautiful melody and haunting lyrics, this song caught my ear the first time I listed to the album.<br /><br />Gallow's Pole- A country song with a tremendous build up of musical complexity and maturity, Zeppelin conquers this folk classic with the ease with which only Zeppelin can do.<br /><br />Since I've Been Loving You- A fantastic riff, though it does tend to drag a bit.<br /><br />Out on the Tiles- The mesmerizingly addictive riff and melody can make you listen to this one over and over again.
B000002QWD|5.0|Many artists have recorded \\"White Christmas\\" but none have achieved the quality of The Master. This album is a treasure of memories for my generation as well as a timeless collection of holiday classics. Bing's signature warmth gives meaning to spiritual carols like \\"Silent Night\\", \\"Adeste Fidelis\\", and \\"Faith of Our Fathers\\" and fun singalongs like \\"It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas\\" and \\"Silver Bells.\\"  Buy the album, sing along, relive the memories, and introduce a new generation to a treasure.
B0002XDODU|5.0|One of the more unlikely success stories in music-business history, German heavy-metal collective Rammstein creates a totally uncompromising and wildly (some would say ridiculously) dramatic sound that combined elements of goth, industrial, Wagnerian opera, and progressive rock, with lyrics sung almost exclusively in German. Rammstein's concerts were even more over-the-top than the ensemble's recorded output, matching the performance art-inspired wackiness of Devo with the gross-out antics of Gwar.On its fourth album, REISE, REISE, the group continues on its mission to be one of the heaviest, spookiest, and most bizzare acts in rock, delivering one bone crunching, sci-fi/monster-movie-like epic after another. The title track mates effects-laden My Bloody Valentine-style guitars with Dream Theater-like twists and turns, while \\"Morgenstern\\" features a chorus that sounds straight out of an Alpine beer hall operated by Freddy Krueger. The most significant break with the classic Rammstein sound, however, comes with \\"Los,\\" which is driven by a surprisingly bluesy acoustic guitar. Often sounding less like a band and more like the disembodied product of a haunted, demon-possessed recording studio, REISE, REISE will undoubtedly please any fan of extreme music. <br />
B00004T0US|4.0|The decline of Elvis in the final couple of years of his life is well documented, many books, film materials have gone into great detail of that period of his life and career. This album definitely reflects the emotional state of his life in 1976 and 1977. Recorded mostly inside the \\"Jungle Room\\" inside Graceland (believe it or not with decent sound quality)as Elvis did want to go to a formal recording studio to record, so RCA brought one to Graceland. A few of the songs are from concerts in 1976/1977. The album generally reflects a \\"down\\" Elvis singing heart wrenching ballads of life's losses, and anguished pain. His live version of \\"Unchained Melody\\" (it is he playing the piano on the tune) is a soaring vocal achievment, as close to an opera rendition as one will get with Elvis, a stunning, towering performance where what was left of the energy he had a few months before he died was poured into every note. Same came be said for \\"Hurt\\", the reworking of the Timi Yuro tune of nearly 20 years earlier. Elvis makes it his own, and it became a concert staple for him thereafter often bringing down the house when he performed it on stage. There is some lightweight material on the album like the fumbled \\"Lil' Darlin'\\" but the album is redeemed with the Top 20 hit \\"Moody Blue\\" and excellent songs like \\"For the Heart and \\"Way Down\\". Believe it or not, there is an Andrew Lloyd Webber tune \\"It's Easy For You\\", a bizarre curio for Elvis fans. Then there is the punch in the gut, heart wrenching \\"Never Again\\" about the wrenching loss of love. The remaining ballads are well performed, with a nice performance of \\"The Last Farewell\\", which Elvis personally loved, you can almost see the misty coast of England in the song. This is not Elvis's best album, not a rock and roll collection. It borders on Tom Jones at time and a bit careless at other moments, but it does show the voice of Elvis, near the end was very powerful, and the emotion layed down in the tracks is very real. If you have not heard it and are a casual Elvis fan, it is somewhat different, but definitely worth a listen. I recommend you purchase it.
B00026W82U|5.0|This is definitely one of the best CDs I've bought in years.  The melodies are so impressive for such young men.  They sound well seasoned, well beyond their years.  I've come to love each and every song, which is what I find so impressive about this group.  Every song is honorable of a listen.  Too often I've bought a CD with the best of intensions on finding a new great artist only to find that the CD has one good song and the rest of them left much to be desired.  But not this one.  I find myself humming these songs at random points in my day on most days.  They are so memorable, distinct, and quite unique.  I was actually so impressed with this particular disc that I purchased a copy for every single person on my Christmas list.  What's interesting is that I found it to be the perfect gift for my best friend (who, by the way, is 22) and also for my boss (who is like 60).  Surprisingly, it works for just about anyone.  So if you've been debating on whether or not to buy this one or not, let me help you out, DEFINITELY BUY IT!  Really give this one a chance too.  It's gets better every listen.  A song you might not have cared for the first time around might become your favorite by your third listen.  It's interesting in that way.
B0000009SG|4.0|I can accept people not liking or even hating certain Zappa albums but to be so utter hateful and moronic to review all Zappa's albums with the same mindless reviewtext... I mean, there's no way this guy has heard all Zappas albums (especially since they are so different from each other)and come off with the same conclusion. Please remove his unprofessional ramblings from the site. <br />
0920668372|1.0|I read this book at a bookstore and decided not to purchase it.  While I appreciate the unconditional love the mother has for her son, I found it disturbing that she would drive across town and crawl into his window to rock him while he slept, etc.  I also found those illustrations bizarre.  I don't think it's suitable for a child - what four year old wants to hear about his sick mother?  It's more suited to touch the emotions of the reader than the listener.  Perhaps an older child (teenager) would appreciate it.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I love Sarah Mclachlan's voice and \\"Afterglow\\" is a special gift.  How many women today can sing with just a piano in the background and sound so great?  It's a rare vocal quality and she certainly possesses it.  Sit by the fire with a glass of wine, add \\"Afterglow\\" and you have it made.
0385513755|5.0|I have to say that I read this about 2\\" thick book in less than 3 days! Once I started reading, I was not able to put the book down.  It was a super thriller with amazing facts and it made me travel throughout our history and past with the most fascinating wording.  A must read, and great book!
0735619670|5.0|\\"Code Complete\\" is a really important book. If nothing else, it's an incredible survey of literature about programming covering the entire history of the field. Every significant study of how programmers do their work is covered in its pages. <br /> <br />There's also an amazing amount of practical advice about everything from code formatting, variable naming and writing control structures, all the way up to assembling and managing a programming team -- and managing your manager, too. <br /> <br />The second edition adds a lot of new examples in Java, and goes lighter on less common languages like Pascal and APL than did the first edition. There are also new sections about agile methods and object orientation, perfectly respectable material, although admittedly not much new or unique there. <br /> <br />Every programmer should be familiar with this book.
B00005JMXX|4.0|So wrong on so many levels -- yet, definitely entertaining.  This movie must be watched in the privacy of your own home so you can hoot at the plot absurdities.  It's so bad it's good!
B000089RVX|5.0|It's a shame that a band like Evanescence has the stage presence issues that they do.  It is the one thing from holding them back from greatness.  Fallen is a spectacular piece of work. <br /> <br />Amy Lee has one of those voices - you know...the one's that stick with you, haunt you, that you hear even when the disc isn't playing.  Whether she's driving through one of the harder tracks or pouring her heart into one of the ballads she makes this band.  The instrumental work is fantastic but be prepared to be blown away by the vocals.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Those who have been patiently waiting for the original 3 Star Wars films to appear on DVD might be sorely disappointed with this set. These are NOT the original theatrical releases, but \\"upgraded\\" versions with new scenes added and the sound re-mixed completely.    For me, the sound is the biggest disappointment. The sound effects, particularly explosions and laser blasts are cranked up so high that it interrupts the flow of John Williams' wonderful music, which in this of all films is essential and all but carries certain scenes on its back!    Stylistically too, the shiny new chrome colors of this release, as well as all the new CGI effect are inconsistent with the film's 1970's innocence. Like any other film, this one belongs to a certain time and culture, and to \\"update\\" it like this takes it completely out of any context.    I don't know why filmmakers have the urge to revisit their old work. Perhaps it can be attributed to new self awareness as an artist. Sure, we would all like to go back in time and re-do some of the things we think we didn't get quite right the first time, but with art this can be disastrous, as it is here!    Mr. Lucas, give us back the original Star Wars movies!
B00005JMJG|5.0|I have always been a fan of Charlie Kauffman written films (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, etc.) and I have to say that this is eaily the best Kauffman film. <br /> <br />Also, I can truly say it is the best film of 2004. Jim Carrey is suprisingly good, same with Kirsten Dunst (whom I absolutley loathe, until seeing this film), and Kate Winslet gives the performance of a life time. <br /> <br />The film, of course, is amazingly written, and superbly directed by Michel Gondry, this being Michel's first film, who previously directed some music vides by the likes of White Stripes and Bjork. <br /> <br />This is a great film in that is plays with human emotions. This film will make you laugh, smile, cry, and confused. <br /> <br />A great film, go see it, NOW!
1577311523|5.0|I liked this book alot. It really gave me insight about how I should live my life and enjoy it. My friend had referred me to this book and it has changed my life for the better. Will buy this book.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Dear Mr. Rice, <br />Well done chap. The lyrics are simple enough to show that you've been writing a while and no longer succumb to silly lyric standards. They're also poignant and beautiful. Good stuff. The music is also a pleausre to listen to, just nice and acoustic, sometimes peaking into epicly large sonic soundscapes, sometimes content to stay conservitave. Nice to listen to for sure. I dunno if anyone told you though... you just don't have the pipes for the stuff you're writing. I'm sorry but you don't. You write way out of your range and your falsetto is the worst I think I've ever heard commited to CD. You crack, can't keep a steady note, and are all over the place with your voice. In fact, if you ever want to make another cd, give me a call, I can probably (the probably added only out of courtesy) sing better than you. Regadless though for some reason your voice is charming. It works. I don't know quite why, it goes against all of the \\"rules of passable singing\\" but it fits. So a job well done. The cd's incredible. You've succeded at being a terrible vocalist and still sounding amazing. That's quite the feat... look forward to the next album.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I know people are talking a lot about how linkin park sucks, but to me they are more unique than most heavy metal bands. One reviewer said all these heavy metal bands are better than linkin park. GET OVER IT linkin park has more multitalented than any of those metals. Linkin Park has more elements to them than most metal, but not all of them. This album proves that with songs like Faint, Numb,and Breaking the habit which are all good songs. Those nonbelievers better reconized linkin park is here to stay.
B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath was one of the most unique bands of the 70's. They combined a heavy style with chilling subject matter to create a unique style, a complete antithesis of the hippie counterculture. That being said, you can see why the album is the way it is. However, this album doesn't match up in ranks to their 2nd and 3rd albums, Paranoid and Master of Reality. This 5 track CD features two essential tracks, Black Sabbath and Behind the Wall of Sleep/NIB. The Wizard is entertaining, but Sleeping Village and Wicked World don't quite cut it. Black Sabbath isn't that much of a good song, and is quite boring in fact. However, it truly showcases the band's style. Behind the Wall of Sleep/NIB is in my opinion one of the band's best songs. It truly showcases the band's musicianship, their heavy style, and their amazing songwriting ability. <br /> <br />Even though NIB and Black Sabbath are essential cuts, the album as a whole doesn't satisfy. It's not a turn-on for new Black Sabbath fans. I suggest buying Paranoid and Master of Reality before buying this album, so you aren't turned off of the band.
B000008QMN|3.0|Pink floyd without Waters. That's all. The music is here, the inspiration is gone
B0001WTWZQ|4.0|Is this the version of pumping iron I watched at my cousin's house.  In that version, Arnold has a monologue about how much he likes cumming, and how weight lifting, and body building contests are like cumming, and so he's always cumming in some fashion.  Then there's the version I saw in gym class, where the cumming monologue is edited out.  I want to know if this one has the cumming or not.  I like the cumming.  It's funny to watch a young arnold with a rich, robust Austrian accent say the word cum like 7 times in a minute.  I'll admit it, I'm only in it for the cumming.  Terminator 3 sucked anyway.
B00028HBKC|5.0|i may be a metalhead, but i know that Jesus died for my sins and He comes first in my life before any metal band does. this movie is awesome, but there are a few things that don't happen in the Holy Bible, like satan carrying around a baby, Judas Iscariot being tormented by a bunch of kids,and one of the criminals getting pecked in the head by a crow. if this movie moved you to accept Jesus as your Savior, remember these three things: Jesus died, Jesus rose, and Jesus is coming again.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Your best bet in life is to have realistic expectations. In some ways, this set really surpasses them. In others, it disappoints. <br />    The Good: the Original Trilogy on DVD! And way better than the pirate copies I bought in China! The image quality cannot be beat: crisp, with vibrant colors. I watched it on just a standard TV, and I was still blown away. It was like seeing them for the first time. The bonus disk has a pretty good documentary on the making of all three films, as well as a good (but not exhaustive) selection of film and tv spots.  <br />   The Bad: The documentary, while interesting, still seems thin, and doesn't go into a lot of detail. Even casual Star Wars fans (are there any left?) will know most ? Is there some ugly secret out there? Everyone seems to toe the company line in their statements. Also, it is overwhelmingly weighted towards the techno-geek aspects. Similarly, just as with the Prequel Trilogy DVDs, the commentaries on these films are a complete, soul-numbing waste of time. Carrie Fisher makes a polite appearance, and occasionally is allowed to say something interesting. Do we get Carrie relating humorous anecdotes? Once or twice. Does George tell us what was going through his mind in certain scenes? Nope. What about the changes he made, even from the Special Edition? Uh-uh. Do we get the sound guy droning endlessly about where every single sound came from? Yeah. WHO CARES! One or two of the most interesting sounds would have been great. Instead, during a changed scene, we get no explanation of the reasoning, only droning about sound and special effect shots. It's interesting to write this off to George's technophilia, but I also suspect that the man just doesn't feel like he owes anyone an explanation.  Honestly, worst commentaries I've ever heard for a set of movies where large numbers of people might conceivably listen to the commentary. Compare these to the commentaries on the Lord of the Rings DVDs, and sicken yourself. <br/>   The Ugly: Sometimes the sound doesn't seem mixed right. Often, I can't hear the soundtrack because the sound effects are mixed too high. Frustrating. Obviously, the changes made require mention. Honestly, the only one that bothers me is the Han/Greedo Self-Defense travesty.  But purists will hate the inclusion of Hayden in ROTJ (it doesn't make sense, but is inoffensive), as well as the modification of the Emperor in ESB (this one I like).  <br />    Bottom line: Lucas continues to chip away at his legacy, seemingly out of spite or some kind of self-destructive urge. Still, these are the best versions of the movies available. If you ever loved them, get them. Of course, if you don't like these version, just wait a year or two. We can't be far from an annual patch of \\"fixes\\", like it's a piece of software. Sigh.

B000005JA8|5.0|Not until you've taken a voyage with the Captain. Ultimately, what matters is not whether you love it, but whether you've engaged with it. I come from that school of thought that says you can be bettered by something, even if you ultimately reject it. If you're looking at this page, then you've heard of Captain Beefheart. If you've heard of him, then there's a chance you could learn to love him. Many are called, few are chosen.  <br />   This was my first Beefheart CD, and it led to a consuming passion. I've got them all now, and some I enjoy more than this one, but this is still the Beefheart touchstone, the measure for all that followed. <br />   The difficulty of the music is legendary. For all that, it's exagerrated. Sure, there's more than a handful of art-noise-pieces. But there's also some great tunage, made even better by the fact that it's incredibly weird, and like nothing else. Moonlight on Vermont is a bluesy, souful, hard-stompin' romp, a classic. Ella Guru is funky and catchy as hell, helped out by the Muppet backup vocals. Spoken word piece Dust Blows Forward...is made more interesting by the clicking texture of the old tape recorder it was made on, not to mention the Captain's small errors. It has an immediate, on-the-spot feel missing so often from music.  <br />   No mistake, this CD is not for everybody. But if you're sonically adventurous, if you love popular music and its history, you should seriously check this out. If you really want a reference, middle to late period Tom Waits is a pretty good imitation of the Captain. Waits, though brilliant and eccentric in his own right, can't hold a candle to the Captain for sheer inventiveness. The best introduction to the Captain is a certain trifecta: this album (his most extreme), Safe As Milk (blues-stomp and doo wop, very accessible), and the Clear Spot/Spotlight Kid disc (my personal fav: decadent blues, clear production, and awesome tunes, like Big Eyed Beans from Venus). Put those other geniuses of the 60s - Dylan, Lennon, McCartney - in their place: CD case to case with Don VanVliet.

B00006879E|4.0|First off, let me say that I'm really surprised at the number and tone of some of the negative reviews of this CD.  One reviewer referred to it as \\"radio pap\\".  To casually lump tracks like \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"This Love\\" with the synthetic, derivative teeny bopper crap coming from the likes Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Usher, et.al., suggests a high degree of ignorance and not much of a discerning ear.  This 48 year old considers \\"Songs About Jane\\" to be one of the best CDs to hit the music scene in the last few years.  The guys in Maroon 5, particularly Adam Levine, have hit upon a mixture of rock, funk, and soul that might seem derivative or formulaic in theory but that in practice produces some of the most unique and listenable songs I've heard on commercial FM radio in ages.   <br /> <br />The only weak track on this CD, in my humble opinion, is \\"Shiver\\", which sounds kinda \\"boy-bandish\\".  I keep wondering when Justin Timberlake's going to record a cover version.  Best tracks: \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Sunday Morning\\".  Adam Levine's vocals bring to mind Stevie Wonder.  Another song of note is \\"Not Coming Home\\", which features some interesting guitar work from fellow Nebraskan James Valentine.  The guitar line sounds like it was lifted from a 70s porno film soundtrack.  I think it's pretty cool.  \\"She Will Be Loved\\", currently getting airplay on commercial radio, has a smoothness and ambience to it I haven't heard since I was in high school in the 70s.  Again, Levine's vocals are superb. <br /> <br />Bottom line here...ignore the negative reviewers but don't take my word for it on \\"Songs About Jane\\".  If what I and others have written about the band and the CD intrigues you, give it a listen.  I'll bet you end up buying it.
0385513755|4.0|I throughly enjoyed the book though it seemed to want to scandalize Christianity.  Read the book, enjoy the book, but if you really have questions about Christianity, then study Christianity.  You will see how it brings up valid questions and then answers them without understanding the true nature of Christianity.  I hope no one is duped.  I had a good laugh reading it myself.
0061015725|2.0|I came to this book with high expectations from Jurassic Park, Disclosure, and Timeline (which was a better book than movie). I was dissapointed by this book, I expected it to be better than it was. It is readable, but I did not get a good feel for the characters and the storyline, while interesting on the surface, suffers from what is best described as \\"limp\\" telling. It just didn't grab me as most good books do. I can't say that it will do the same for you, but this is my opinion.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Highway to Hell is the pinnacle of AC/DC's album efforts.  While the band has many great songs from their catalogue of disks, none of their other albums can begin to compare as a cohesive collection of songs.  This is Bon Scott's last and most driving performance on wax.  The replacement singer was one lucky guy -- just when the band was on the brink of $$$$$, old Bon fell victim to a pass-out overload and BJ swept in and cashed-in.  I'll admit that Back in Black isn't all bad, but the stuff after that steadily becomes more and more formulaic.  Get this album and get your nasty goin'.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is possibly one of the greatest romantic comedys ever filmed.  All the sub-plots of this film make it intreguing and entertaining.  The different situations all the characters go through are hillarous, gut-wrenching, and heart warming.  This movie has it all, you will laugh, cry, be in suspense, and by the end realize that love actually is all around.
0440539811|5.0|&#34;Truly a Masterpiece,&#34; I thought, when comming back down to earth, after having my mind blown by the fnords. Shea and Wilson's book of conspiracies--on top, of conspiracies--will open one's mind to what's really going on. This doped and sexed up trilogy is vividly outrageous, and funny. Throwing every idea the authors could come up with--in rapid fire sequences; the story could very well be the key for one to reach Cosmic Illumination, or not.  It may be the greatest book of all time--like many reviewers claim--or not. The answer is up to the response of each persons individual nervous system. However if you like books, with geners and subject matters related to sex, satirical humor, sex, drugs, sex, conpiracies, sex, historical fact and fiction, sex, fantasy, sex, sci fi, sex, magic, sex, thriller, and of course lots of sex...I mean erotica, in both perverse and of a loving nature, you will probably enjoy this book thoroughly. If you don't like much of what has just been listed, you probably won't like the above mentioned title, and probably shouldn't bother picking up the book.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Well...when a person thinks of Zepp, they usually think of the sound of the amazing guitar solo in Stairway. This is what I thought as well before I bought this DVD. As you witness some of the greatest concerts ever performed, you may start to realize that...WOW...all of their music is completely amazing. The emotion that you see on Jimmy Page's face as he blasts away at his solos moves you. I can't believe that this DVD wasn't made years ago. A friend of mine had urged me to buy the DVD so when I got home I planned to watch the first few songs. Four hours later I was still glued to the TV. Some of their greatest performances are on these 2 DVDs. Kashmir is amazing. Since I bought this, I have become addicted to Led Zeppelin. You will too.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I will tell you that in the future this trilogy will be considered a masterpiece of art. Seminal. Period. <br />I would also echo what the positive reviewers have to say about the disc set. Althought I did shell out the extra clams for the previous versions, (which is always a little personally unsettling),I can tell you this 10 disc set is the BOMB. Commentaries are fantastic by Dr. Cornel West, one of the preeminent thinkers of our time, and of course, a council elder of Zion. <br />The Roots of the Matrix disc was utterly incredible and dynamic in its dicussion of the philosophical underpinnings on which the movie's themes were based. The dics I was waiting for. It also gave an educational tour-de-force with its presentation show of the worlds great philosophers and their ideas and times. Intellectual discussions follow regarding A.I. and man's ability to reason. Awesome! <br />The music only track with almost 3hrs of non-stop matrix music was fantastic! ( i only wish i had it for my car) <br />The new digital enhancements and transfers, audio & visual, were great! <br />Good work guys! You make me proud to be from Chi-town again! Thank you.
B00063MBU8|1.0|I'm sorry, but Simple Plan is among one of the worst bands I have ever had the misfortune to hear. \\"You don't know what it's like to be like me\\"? Oh, come on. Like nobody else has EVER felt like you have. (The first time I heard that song on the radio I laughed - it's that bad.) How old are you again? By the sound of your music, I could have sworn you were all thirteen years old. <br /> <br />Give me a break. I have news for all of you junior high and high school children who think you're tragically misunderstood and deprived. YOU AREN'T. You too will one day grow up and look back and shudder at how revoltingly selfish you were. Think of other people for once, and stop being so concerned with yourselves. Just because Mommy didn't buy you that Nintendo you wanted (gee, I don't know, she has to FEED YOU and PAY THE BILLS, how dare she not give you everything you want?!) doesn't mean you have to slit your wrists the wrong way - purely for attention and some \\"kewliez punk rawk gawthic skarz\\" - while blaring music such as this and smearing your eyeliner for effect. <br /> <br />This music is crap, the lyrics are crap, and the kids who listen to it are 99 percent crap. Grow up.
B000003TA4|3.0|I'm going to get viciously attacked by this...    This is the deal with this album; it's not that good. Nirvana pretty much COMPLETELY changed their sound from Bleach (which was real good) to more steady average structured songs here on Nevermind, money purposes? Hey, maybe. Is it full of angst? Yes. Is it angry? Yes. Is it sludgy? Sort of. Maybe I would like this more if the radio didn't play the hell out of 80% of the tracks (especially one about deodorant) and maybe I'd like it better if the last track didn't suck so much (come on, \\"Something in the Way\\" is a boring, forgettable track, and radio stations WILL play it to somehow represent that they're cool by playing the last track on a supposedly amazing masterpiece). But the most important thing is, I'd probably like it a hell of a lot more if kids who thought they had a million things on their mind stopped displaying Kurt Cobain as Jesus Christ, he wasn't. Kurt Cobain hated himself folks, he's not the one to idolize. Another reason why I dislike this album is because people view NEVERMIND as the epitome of the Seattle scene, and of course, grunge. It's not even. What about those other guys? Mudhoney? Mother Love Bone? Green River? Screaming Trees? And is it me, or do some Nirvana songs on here sound strikingly familiar to a Green River or Mudhoney track?     If you feel the same way as me but don't know much about Nirvana, get this one used, and check out \\"Insecticide\\" or \\"Bleach\\". Regardless of all the negative comments, I gave it 3 stars because there are some songs on here that still keep this album worth the money, \\"Drain You\\" \\"Territorial Pissings\\" \\"On a Plain\\".    Oh and one more thing about this album- ...you know what, I'm just gonna, oh whatever, never mind.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|You know, as much as I hated Avril Lavigne's first album and her totally faux punk-rock aura, I can't help but give her a better rating on this CD.  I actually managed to enjoy \\"My Happy Ending\\". While she is not by any stretch of the imagination one of my favourite artists, I do find some enjoyment - however banal - in some of the tracks on Under My Skin. I do realize that this is marketed towards the 14 year old girl crowd (the children who wear those ridiculous neckties have awakened the murderous streak within me). However, if you're looking for an album that requires no thought processes whatsover (mindless semi-entertaining fluff), go ahead and add it to your shopping cart.   <br /> <br />P.S. \\"Nobody's Home\\" sounds horribly like a TaTu song. I could have sworn it was them the first time I heard it.
B00004Z459|5.0|I am a huge fan of Linkin Park nad this CD. Linkin Park masterfully combines rap and rock to create their music which is amazing. This is how I would rate the songs on Hybrid Theory:    1. Papercut - 9.5/10 - Very catchy tune, great singing, lyrics, and drumming. One of the more rap songs on the CD.    2. One Step Closer - 10/10 - One of my personal favorite Linkin Park songs - great singing again.     3. With You - 8/10 - At first I didn't really like this song, but then I liked it after hearing it a couple times. Ok song.     4. Points of Authority - 7.5/10 - Another not-so-good song. Great Lyrics, but just not sung well.    5. Crawling - 8.5-9/10 - Another song I didn't like at first. Sort of melancholy feeling about it. Great singing by Chester.    6. Runaway - 10/10 - Another favorite. Catchy lyrics and excellent drumming. Sung very well too.    7. By Myself - 7.5/10 - Very Loud song. Great screaming, err, singing by Chester.    8. In the End - 10/10 - Very popular and very good song. Excellent singing. Linkin Park at its best on this one.    9. A Place for My Head - 8.5/10 - Superb guitar in this song that sticks out in the beginning of the song. Otherwise an aveage song.    10. Forgotten - 8.5/10 - Sounds somewhat like \\"By Myself\\" much better sung though.    11. Cure for the Itch - 9/10 - No singing in this song. Just druming mixed by a DJ.     12. Pushing Me Away - 8/10 - Another average song, but very excellent lyrics        I hope this is a help for you. I would strongly advise you to buy this CD for it is very good.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|One of the coolest Cd's of the year. This Scottish Quartet has<BR>mixed 80S NEW WAVE, WITH 70S DISCO brilliantly. KEEPS You moving while listening. My only negative comment is they have tendecy to repeat there lyrics.
B000660UN0|5.0|I'm a huge Clapton fan and have been Disapointed time after time after time. Releases like Pilgrim and Riding with the king have only let me down. This is the REAL thing, the music is great as is the DVD. Live in the studio, no overdubs - no nonsense. <br /> <br />If you like Clapton BUY this now. Proabably the best thing he's done in 20 years.
0066620996|5.0|Research and good storytelling is the foundation of this book.  Collins and his team did an excellent job of uncovering key elements of what happened in various organizations as they evolved to great companies.  The book focused primarily on large organizations in its analysis.      I recommend the book for all those in the corporate structure with the task of making the company a great company.  [...]
B0002WZTOI|4.0|\\"Top Gun\\" is the mach ten 80s mega hit that set theatre attendance on fire and established producer Jerry Bruckheimer and actor Tom Cruise as two of Hollywood's king size titans, behind and in front of the camera. All about a military flight school run for `the best of the best,' the film stars Cruise as Lt. Pete Maverick Mitchell. Pete's too sexy for his leather bomber jacket and he knows it. He's also short on pleasantries when it comes to wooing the femme fatale of the friendly skies, Charlotte `Charlie' Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). But high flying maneuvers between Pete and Charlie quickly move from the school room to the bedroom. Then tragedy strikes and Pete has to pull it together to prove himself as the hero of the hour. Val Kilmer costars as Pete's annoying and priggish rival for the top honors; Tom `Iceman' Kazanski. The cast also includes Tom Skeritt, Michael Ironside and Anthony Edwards.  <br /> <br />What sets \\"Top Gun\\" apart from similar military film fare of the 80s is its ability to combine a sense of the miraculous within the gritty world of tougher than tough obstacles. The dog fight footage is thrilling and the plot moves effortlessly from drama, to melodrama, to action/adventure yarn on testosterone overdrive. There's even a shirtless eye candy volleyball tournament thrown in, with the guys doing their machismo best to ignite interest in the female population. However, the soundtrack album, which fueled the film's high octane performance at the box office, now seems to have dated at twice the rate of any other from the 80s - save `Dirty Dancing.' Kenny Loggins' `Playin' With The Boys' and Tina Marie's `Lead Me On' have that faint tinny echo of a forgotten pop culture where hoop earrings and big hair were synonymous with wacky-tacky red carpet glamour. Berlin's `Take My Breath Away' does anything but.    <br /> <br />After the disastrous effort put forth on Paramount's `Footloose' special editon, I didn't hold out much hope for this transfer either. However, \\"Top Gun's\\" anamorphically enhanced transfer is remarkably clean and solid. Color saturation is very nicely rendered with velvety blacks and very pristine whites. Occasionally one will note a slight hint of film grain. There are no digital anomalies (edge enhancement, pixelization, shimmering of fine details) for a smooth video presentation that is sure to please. The audio has been remixed but continues to exhibit that dated 80s quality that is best left to nostalgia for a time when sound wasn't quite so integral to one's overall appreciation of movie culture.  Extras include an audio commentary that is adequate at best. There's also a 6 part documentary that really should have been played as one big one, four music videos which will confound people as to why MTV became so big, and some storyboards, production materials and vintage featurettes. So set your DVD player to `cruise' control and get ready to set off for the wild blue yonder. \\"Top Gun\\" is a blast!  <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Sadly, I'll have to agree with many of the U2 fans who've reviewed this album here - it grows on you.  It's unfortunate that it doesn't clobber the audience with a crashing right hook like Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby.  But then again, neither did All That You Can't Leave Behind.   <br /> <br />On first listen, I didn't hear anything that really stood out on this one, except to some degree, Miracle Drug and Sometimes you can't make it on your own.  Vertigo was somewhat disappointing upon first listen - not bad but not an absolutely amazing single either.  However, after listening to the whole album four times straight I finally heard it.  And then the songs really came to life.   <br /> <br />Vertigo became the solid opener that it is.  It reminds me most of Desire from Rattle and Hum - quick, harsh, and it rocks.  <br /> <br />Miracle Drug and Sometimes you can't make it on your own showed varied qualities - anthemic and deep - maybe not along the lines of Where the Streets have no name or One - but still very strong and enough to keep me coming back to listen over and over.  In my opinion, the two best songs on the album, followed closely by the closing three. <br /> <br />Love Peace or Else - initially I could tell it was a pretty good song but couldn't quite place it amongst U2's library.  I think it's the kind of song that will be pretty hot live - akin to Bullet the Blue Sky.  It doesn't have that's song's relevance or poetry - it's a bit too straightforward - but it comes pretty close. <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights - this one was at first a big question mark but has really shown itself to be a great tune.  It's anthemic, along the lines of Miracle Drug, a little different with the keyboard/piano work but it has tons of layers and definitely one of better written songs on the album.  I can see this becoming a big hit with fans, especially in live shows. <br /> <br />A Man and a Woman - another one that really grew on me over time.  It falls into the pretty good u2 song category -- similar to New York or In a little while on their last album, or Please on Pop.  Admittedly, I wish it didn't take a few listens for me to take a real liking, but maybe that's the beauty of this album. <br /> <br />All because of you and Crumbs from your table - my two least favorite songs on the album.  All because of you has the makings of real hit - great construction, solid lyrics, everything coming together until the chorus, which is mind-bogglingly awful -- the melody is just lost as if the fellas channeled some drunken show from 25 years back when Bono had no control over his voice.  Not sure what happened because it really could've been a great song.  Crumbs from your table - another one with pretty solid construction - it just didn't grow on me like most of the others did.  The melody and lyrics are, for this album, just average. <br /> <br />One step closer, Original of the Species and Yahweh - along with Songs 2 and 3, these are the best on the album.  Lyrically, all three delve into depths that most bands dare not go.  Bono's not quite a poet - evidenced by his many forays into cheese - but he's capable of drawing from some pretty personal stuff without being pretentious, and that's a nice trick.  These are quieter songs, but they really hit the heart of what U2's been about after the 1990 reinvention - more of the personal, the pains of the human heart.  And while, to most songwriters, that seems to be about just their own pains, u2 manages to find a more universal voice - so the songs are about self, about family, about twisted experiences, about people. <br /> <br />On the whole - a pretty great album from start to finish.  I'll suggest, as others have, that people really give it a chance.  I've mentioned that to some friends who were less than enthused and they all agreed - it really works over time.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|Forty years old and still practically perfect in every way! Even at 2hr.s, 20 min. \\"Mary Poppins\\" remains Walt Disney's crowning technical and artistic achievement; an effervescent eclectic blend of animation/live action and special effects that idyllically encompasses P.L Travers' enchanting best seller. Julie Andrews' London stage performance in `Camelot' so impressed Disney that he immediately began talks to secure her talents for his film. By the time shooting began, Andrews was playing Eliza on stage in `My Fair Lady'. That she was casually looked over for the lead in the film version of that play remains a mystery. But Lady's loss was Poppin's gain.  <br /> <br />Andrews delights in the title role as the too good to be true nanny with just enough playful larceny lurking beneath her properly quaffed locks and bonnet. She arrives to take charge of the Bank's household and whip them into shape; wife Winifred (Glynis John), husband George (David Tomlinson) and their two children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice). Seems Jane and Michael have been giving the previous nannies a hard time. Actually, they're just a pair of lonely kids who desire the love and attention of their stoic dad. A lowly chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) helps provide Mary and the children with one of those supercalafragalisticexpialadocious bits of escapism set to magic; a fantastic frolic in the country complete with carousel ride, fox hunt and horse races. Yikes, tally-ho! There's so much to admire and celebrate in this perennial classic that it's best left to the home viewer to pop this one in for a jolly holiday of a good time! <br /> <br />Disney's deluxe, 2-disc DVD is a genuine treat. At long last, anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions, the transfer is generally quite smooth and solid for image quality that will surely please. Colors are rich and vibrant. Blacks are solid and deep. Whites are generally clean. Occasionally there is a hint of age related artifacts as well as some minor pixelization that breaks apart some of the background information, but these distractions are kept to a bare minimum. The audio is a brand new, and very engaging, 5.1 mix for the home theatre aficionado. Extras include the all new 50 min. documentary on the making of the film that is quite comprehensive. There's also some self congratulatory audio commentaries and `A Musical Journey' with composer, Richard Sherman. The rest of the extras are typical Disney catering to the tot's fanfare; a trivia game, special effects junket and some music video and short subject stuff. All in all this is a very nicely packed special edition from the Disney stable and one that's been long overdo. So get out your umbrella or go fly a kite; because \\"Mary Poppins\\" is shear magic for the young and young at heart!   <br />
B0000CD5I6|5.0|For those of us old enough to remember Jethro Tull from the 70's and 80's, this new CD is a delight.  It also makes a wonderful change to the rather mundane Christmas carol selections that are usually dragged out at this time of year. <br /> <br />The familiar flute is heard throughout the CD as Ian Anderson performs jaunty seasonal songs along with gentle and lyrical classical songs.  There are mixes of carols arranged in medleys together, such as The Holly and the Ivy which is mixed with Hark the Herald Angels Sing in an instrumental. Both Greensleeves and We Three Kings are given an arrangement that makes the original still recognizable, while at the same time the interpretation has a definite Tull flavor.  Several of the original songs reflect a slightly cynical view of the season and our overindulgence, illustrating Tull's unique style, such as in Another Christmas song and The First Snow on Brooklyn.   <br /> <br />One of the most beautiful tracks on the CD is Ring Out the Solstice Bells.  The flute creates the sounds of the bells ringing, creating an almost Dickensian feel to the song. <br /> <br />Reviewers have declared that this is the best work of Jethro Tull in many years, and I have to agree with that.  However, even if you are from the post-vinyl era, this makes an interesting change to the rather sugary renditions of seasonal songs, whilst staying within the spirit of the Christmas season.  It has become a favorite for our house already and I suspect it will stay that way for many years.  <br /> Some of the CDs are also packaged with a DVD that contains 3 tracks.  The familiar Tull and company, complete with gypsy scarves, cavort across the stage in Jack in the Green. An updated clean cut Tull is seen performing My Sunday Feeling.  The third track is the infamous Life is a Long Song.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|It seems that you have nothing to base a review on. Why are you here? Why do you read what Roger Friedman of Fox News writes about him being so called \\"dethroned\\", consume it, and then be so gullible as to breathe it? <br /> <br />He's a freakloid loser? Nice word; immature, and yet, do you have a right to bash someone you haven't heard? You didn't mention one song! Just please, get a life, its just down the road, if you can make it there.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The music by so many familiar faces is wonderful.  Eric Clapton,Ringo Starr, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynn and of course George's son who is the image of his father to name a few, play, sing, and rivet their audience in the theater and at home to the performance.  Loved it!
B0006399FS|5.0|Michael T <br /> <br />To get me through my creative writings, I've been listening to most of U2's output non-stopped since February this year, and \\"Bomb\\" easily rates amongst their best 4 or 5 albums.   <br />Right now, \\"Bomb\\" ranks third (behind you know which two) --- there's not one weak song here, aside from the simplistic lyrics to \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", every song is a keeper that enhances the different hours/moods/seasons of the day/week/year!   <br />It is easy to complain that U2 has sold or chilled out, but if the songs are as variable and yet similarly catchy as those in \\"Bomb\\", including the import-only track, \\"Fast Cars\\", then, most artists getting radio plays out there should likewise  just sell/chill out.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|For those who remembered watching Live Aid when it happens, I cannot fathom not having this as a must own.  I remember watching the event, and even have a well-worn, now-unwatchable VHS tape of some of the acts. <br /> <br />If you want to know what music was like in the 80's...Live Aid encapsulates pretty much all of it.  I think it's easier to say who wasn't involved with it than who was...and Phil Collins managed to perform on multiple continents for it.  The lineup is absolutely stellar, and there are very few bad performances to even bother noting. <br /> <br />It wasn't as racuous as Woodstock, and it wasn't as Gonzo as Lollopalooza...but Live Aid documents a moment in our artistic and social history that makes the price of this an absolute steal.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|First, while the set is not cheap, I will surely buy it, both for its DVD quality, and its preserving the extraordinary magic of ensemble acting, storywriting, and flat out lasting entertainment.  However, unlike the description, this set does not contain \\"the first commentary of any kind for a Star Trek TV show.\\"  Fans will remember that, about six years ago, the Sci-Fi Channel ran the entire series.  Each episode included commentary by Shatner and Nimoy, along with truly incisive comments from the Star Trek crew, and guest stars who appeared in the episode then being shown.  I have that entire series on VHS, and it is a keeper.  Still, as I am a Trekker forever, this DVD set will be mine shortly.  It will be lasting proof to all that the original series remains many \\"warps\\" ahead of all the others.
B00005LMBK|5.0|this album has all the great qualities of Blur's music, but more on the side of hip-hop (although the album is great for anyone)... the lyrics are original, and great to listen to.
0393051587|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating in its detail, and in its background information on Charles Dickens, including biographical information with an emphasis on how and why he came to write this timeless tale.  \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the story that has in large part shaped Christmas celebrations since it was published in 1843, and is one of those books that I have loved since I was first introduced to the story as a child.<br /><br />Not only detailed information about the writing and illustration can be found within, but the notes detailing meanings of long-lost words and phrases used in England at Dickens' time, but no longer are common, make this book invaluable.  While the story is familiar, the reader, I am sure, habitually scans by quaint-sounding unfamiliar words; this allows the reader to get the original meaning and, in effect, makes the story almost a rewritten one for those unfamiliar with Victorian verbiage.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, like me, who considers A Christmas Carol to be one of those books I would take to a desert island with me to spend the rest of my life with.  I now will revise that, and will say that I would take THIS VERSION with me.  I have seen nothing to compare with the work shown in this volume, and I recommend it without reservation.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|Anthony Minghella's The English Patient is still one of my favourite movies of all time, and I was eager to see his new film on the same subject.  <br /> <br />I was VERY disappointed. During the entire film I couldn't help thinking, is it a fake or what? It can't be Mingella's movie! To me, all it does is tries to pretend it's the same kind of movie as The English Patient, with similar storytelling and moments that I can clearly see as 'emotional climax triggers'.  <br /> <br />But whereas I almost cried each time I saw the latest Swimmers' Cave episode for the first 15 times watching the English Patient, I had not a single moment of emotional agitation during Cold Mountain. <br /> <br />Very disappointed...
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|WOW! WHAT AN ADRENILEN RUSH. FOR JUST UNDER 2 HOURS, THIS FLICK TOTALLY EXPLODES IN YOUR FACE LIKE NONE OTHER SEEN BEFORE. THE ACTION IS TOTALLY NON STOP, THE GREAT CINEMATOGROPHY AND AC-3 SOUND ARE ASTOUNDING. THE ACTION AS FILMED WITH HAND HELD CAMERAS WILL LEAVE YOU BOTH SHAKEN AND BREATHLESS. I LOVED IT FROM START TO FINISH. MATT DAMON, JOAN ALLEN, AND A GREAT SUPPORTING, BELIEVABLE CAST ALL ADD UP TO THE NUMBER ONE THRILLER OF THE YEAR! DO NOT MISS IT, NOR DENY YOUR FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES A GREAT STOCKING STUFFER THIS HOLIDAY SEASON.  AWESOME FLICK!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I looked forward for months to this much anticipated sequel of the Borne Identity coming to theaters this summer.  As the movie began it all began to unravel during the 1st chase scene when our hero, Jason Borne, is found and running again for his life.  The handheld camera, which is supposed to give you the feel of being there, actually detracts greatly from the scenes.    On the large scene of a movie theater, the motion and quick editing is to fast for the eye to follow well.  You can't focus long enough to tell what is going on.  The closer you sit to the scene, I would think it even more annoying.  The worst 2 scenes filmed in this manner are the main fight scene between Borne and another trained killer agent and the final climatic chase scene in Moscow.  The extra long chase in Moscow is especially difficult to watch as the quick editing and camera work make it tiring and you long for the scene to end soon.    Now that the movie is out on DVD, I rented a widescreen version to watch at home.  On the smaller sized screen the scenes are less noticable and not quite as tiring to watch.    I have read other reviews of people who think this type of motion for action scenes is great, but for the vast majority of movie goers it is very tiresome.  I have always loved roller coasters and thought the newer ones with loops and rolls looked like great fun after observing them from the ground.  But after being in one, I began to get vertigo and nausaus and decided it was more fun to watch them than be in one.  That is true for this movie and its action sequences as well.  It would be better to be an observer standing to the side than a participant.    A few things missing in the movie.  Was it necessary to kill off Maria?  If Berlin police have a manhunt for him, why wouldn't they alert train stations and other public transportation to be on the lookout for him?  How could he take a train to Moscow from Germany without being stopped or caught along the route?  If all of Moscow is looking for Jason Bourne, why did they quit looking?  Is it to be implied that they quit looking for him when they arrested the Russian oil mogul?  After the dramatic car chase and crash in a tunnel by Borne, he abandons his vehicle and leaves on foot.  No one seems to be after him from this point of the movie.  Doesn't ring true.    I would give this movie an \\"A-\\" for acting, \\"B\\" for plot and story development, \\"A-\\" for pacing, \\"B+\\" for action, and a \\"C\\" for camera work.  Overall a \\"C+\\" movie.  It could have been a better film.  The 1st movie with Matt Damon is still the better of the two films.  Hopefully, the producers will take note of movie goers critisizms of this film and do better on the next one.  Because Jason Bourne is a great character to bring to life on the big screen.
B00065JTBA|5.0|Yes, I am a huge bon jovi fan, No, I don't pretend to love every song they ever recorded, although most of them I think are great.  Over the years I've collected what I thought was a decent collection of rarities and bootlegs.  To listen to 4 CD's worth of virtually virgin material to my ears is pretty spectacular.  While I don't think this amazing box set would convert a non jovi believer into one, the 100 million fans out there will love it.  I sure do.  There is NO way I could wait for Santa to bring me this one, but it would be a great gift for a fan who didnt already buy it for themselves!!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I loved both the movie and the soundtrack. The music on this CD is so moving and breathtaking, it doesn't deserve anything under 5 Stars.  Hans Zimmer is a Genius.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is hands-down my top CD of the year... a claim clinched by seeing him perform live twice since its release. His incredibly soulful, emotive voice is heightened by his humble spirit and his seeming disbelief that he is where he is, doing what he is doing. It is refreshing to witness this in a performer, particularly one who possesses such a unique talent. <br /> <br />This CD stayed in my CD player for a solid month, and it left only begrudgingly.... It makes its way back in with some frequency.
B00008PW2D|4.0|Lots of people seem to have negative feelings about this season -- even \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" joined the chorus of boos in a recent issue, calling it the worst of the six seasons. But most complaints seem to focus on the season's brevity and the expense of the box set, which aren't faults of the show itself. <br /> <br />In fact, this is my favorite of the seasons. The show seemed to gain a new maturity, exploring the downside of singledom (namely, loneliness) in a way that previous seasons hadn't. The women were actually single for most of the season, forcing them to concentrate on their friendships and careers. It was also the first season taped after 9-11, and reflects the introspective turn New York City itself took in the months after the towers fell. Sure, some of the episodes were a bit depressing, but depressing in a good way -- i.e., they made you think. To name one example: \\"Plus One is the Loneliest Number\\" managed to blend humor and pathos in plot points such as Samantha's plastic surgery and the Candace Bergen character's split relationship, a situation that she loathed on the one hand and coolly justified on the other. <br /> <br />If you can't get past the sticker price, rent the discs instead!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I bought this DVD last Christmas for my 19 yr old son. I have virtually stolen it from him. I cannot stop watching it, over and over. This DVD is honestly a spiritual experience. When you watch the performers you will realize, as I have, that there was a power greater than all of us in the Hall that night. The ways that George's music is presented gave me an understanding that I never had until this time. His music was inspired by a greater power, and it spoke of peace and love for our world. This concert will shake you to your core. A year ago, I would have told you that I didn't like sitar music or Ravi Shankar's music, but after watching this... I will now tell you that this segment of the concert touches my very soul somehow. Watching Ravi Shankar's daughter lead her orchestra is one of the most compelling performances by anyone I have ever seen and I am over 50 ( and I have seen many superb concerts in my time). Eric Clapton hosts the concert (and he also plays with the Shankar orchestra) and his humility is so real and touching.  To see George's son play makes me weep. He is so like his father. Ringo is there and he's as zany and wonderful as ever. Paul sings. Tom Petty Rocks! (but that is nothing new, no one can work a crowd like Tom Petty.) and the list goes on, and on. You really must see this, and if you buy it for someone as a gift - do yourself a favor and watch it first. You'll never want to part with it.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This film was a massive disapointment.  I loved the first Matrix, it's one of my top five favorite flicks. The second...eh.  The end had a few cool action scenes.  What did this film bring to the table, you ask?  Some neat special effects.  That's about it.  The final battle scene involves a few ancillary characters introduced with minor roles in the second movie.  That's right, none of the original three characters are involved, and even the more important less-important characters are absent (Niobe, Ghost...).  It is literally as exciting as watching someone play a video game.  Without giving too much away, I'll say that it features the longest, most dull death scene in the history of cinema.  This is no exaggeration; I've seen every motion picture ever produced.  But hey, at least there was a lot of high-school-level philosophical speculation, if that interests you at all. <br /> <br />To summarize: if you want to see a movie that has cool special effects, and a psuedo-cool fight scene, but disappointing acting and terrible, terrible writing, watch the latest \\"Star Wars\\" films.  If you want to bore someone you hate, buy them The Matrix: Revolutions. <br />-Steve <br />Steve5805@yahoo.com <br />
B000002HH2|5.0|I was inclined to get a little more personal when I thought about writing this review for Bjork's sophomore effort `Post'.  It's simply too moving and inspiring to look at it from a neutral point of view.  Until just a few months ago, I had no clue what I was missing not listening to Bjork.  Out on a whim, I decided to watch a few of Bjork's videos online, and I was almost immediately intrigued and hooked.  Her raspy strong vocals and fantastic musical arrangements had so much emotion, power and conviction; I was completely stunned and moved.  Within a month, I had purchased nearly all her albums and several singles.  Now, I consider myself a true Bjork fan: one of those listeners who loves every single one of her tracks for one reason or another, and hears the beauty in every note the Icelandic singer belts out. <br /> <br />Bjork's previous album `Debut' was impressive.  Despite it's originality or maybe because of it, critics (for the most part) agreed it was too experimental to be musically inspiring.  However, after being eased into Bjork's style and uniqueness, critics and fans alike took to her follow-up `Post' with enthusiasm.  It's no surprise: the album is more innovative, emotionally moving and contains more musical impact than `Debut'.  I had no choice but to crank up the music real loud on my headphones when I popped this album in my CD player.  There are so many songs that hit the listener hard here.  It's difficult to single out only a few tracks; they are all divine.  Having said that, here's a review of every song on `Post': <br /> <br />Army of Me: This is one of my favorite Bjork songs.  Like many of her tunes, it took some time to grow on me.  I love belting out this song when I'm irritated or upset.  It's great for those emotional moments when you think you're going to burst.  The moving baseline and harsh percussion give a real nice punch to Bjork's already aggressive singing.  This is a fantastic opener for the album, and it showcases Bjork'stalent for writing expressive lyrics beautifully. (6/5) &#60;- this applies and is valid with Bjork songs :) <br /> <br />Hyper-Ballad: Another song that took more than several listens to impress me, ultimately, it can and will seduce you.  The odd time signature arrangement throughout the verses leaves suspicion and uncertainty lingering on you as Bjork belts out her own insecurities in her relationship.  She conveys longing and yearning so well in this song: it's heart wrenching, depressing and completely timeless.  This is definitely one of her best songs. (6/5) <br /> <br />The Modern Things: Somehow, this song is relaxing.  Not quite a dance tune and definitely not a ballad, it's very jazzy and soothing, with a shuffling drumline.  I personally love the charming bell arpeggios in the chorus.  She sings a lot of Icelandic vocals here, which make this song even more precious.  Musically, this song doesn't have as much impact as others, but Bjork doesn't lack for vocal enthusiasm. (4/5) <br /> <br />It's Oh So Quiet: The best thing about this tune is the fun you can hear in Bjork's voice.  This song was originally written and recorded in the 1940s, which is obvious when the ecstatic and upbeat brass instruments crash in against Bjork's voice.  Amazingly, this song suits Bjork very well, and it's one of the most honest songs about the obsessions of lust and love I've ever heard!  It just makes you want to jump up and scream with happiness.  I absolutely love every element of this song: the glockenspiel, the brass, the playful screaming... it's sheer perfection! (6/5) <br /> <br />Enjoy: Looking at the lyrics for this song (before I heard it), I thought it would be soft and mysterious.  I was completely wrong!  Opening with a strong organ, which is quickly joined by a distorted bass, I was pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely Bjork at her best: singing thought provoking lyrics accompanied by simple but powerful and often surprising music.  The sudden trumpet notes are a wonderful touch!  This song seems to take me over; I can't help but dance to it when I hear it.  It's got a very infectious beat. (5/5) <br /> <br />You've Been Flirting Again: After such a loud and thumping dance track, this song offers a nice relaxing mood.  By this point on the album, I really began to realize how eclectic the music is.  Nothing sounds the same, but yet, everything meshes so well.  No percussion, just Bjork and lush string melodies (which she composed by the way) flowing beautifully throughout this tune.  This is a shorter song, which is probably good, because it's very repetitive.  However, Bjork never sings words the same way twice, so it works.  It's hopeful, but it almost makes me cry hearing it. (4/5) <br /> <br />Isobel: The gorgeous strings from the previous track flow right into this song.  The musical arrangement here is absolutely stunning: sweeping strings, a trumpet solo and then falling right into a drum loop that sounds like something from a jungle.  There's a primitive quality about this song that I can't describe how I'd like to.  Words just don't do it justice.  Later in the song, Bjork takes all the elements from the introduction and successfully combines them.  I love the chorus; it's filled with so much raw emotion!  This is a big standout on `Post'. (6/5) <br /> <br />Possibly Maybe: I could listen to this song for hours, just lounging around my room.  It's very unique with its telephone ringing and guitar slides.  This song builds verse by verse, and Bjork's hurt and wonder are very evident.  Uncertain, unhappy and longing for honesty, this is one of Bjork's most painful tracks ever.  I can't help but feel sorry for her here: she sounds so innocent and sweet.  I enjoyed this song the very first time I heard it, and it hasn't lost any of its appeal since then. (5/5) <br /> <br />I Miss You: This is a nice pick-me-up after such a somber tune.  This song has many wonderful elements in it, including bongo hand drums and jumpy saxophones and trumpets.  There's a bit of tropical flavor here, which is very danceable and enjoyable.  The lyrics are perfectly depressing (which is always awesome with Bjork)!  Towards the end, Bjork wails and lets out a playful scream.  When I heard that, I just went ballistic, it was so great!  After the conclusion of this song, you feel like you've had a nice ride emotionally. (5/5) <br /> <br />Cover Me: Simple and almost heavenly, I love the dulcimer and harpsichord solos in this piece.  Electronic echoes seem to tease the lingering notes Bjork sings; the compliments between instruments and vocals are beautiful.  This is another short song, but it's touching and heartfelt nonetheless.  I always feel like taking a walk through the woods after hearing this.  It's inspiring in its own sweet way. (4/5) <br /> <br />Headphones: I'll admit; I wasn't too impressed with this at first.  I found it weird and too long.  But as the title suggests, you really have to listen to this on your headphones, preferably with your eyes closed and just leaning back and relaxing.  Vocally, Bjork really shines here: her harmonies are warm and inviting.  She sounds as if she's ad-libbing throughout, and I find that natural singing very intriguing.  This song is really a wonderful piece of work, and although it sounds thrown together, I'm sure it took her forever to get it right. (4/5) <br /> <br />What's interesting about `Post' is that, from beginning to end, it seems to wind down.  I absolutely love this album, but it sounds like Bjork was getting tired toward the end.  Strangely enough, that isn't a downer; the songs are put together in a way that just makes you want to kick back and chill out with her, as opposed to going `where's the rest of the great stuff?'.  Everything here is fantastic, whether it's upbeat or not.   <br /> <br />With this album, Bjork learned to open up a bit more vocally.  She touched on darker subjects (longing for perfect love and not getting it in `Possibly Maybe') and had a little more fun (going crazy in `It's Oh So Quiet').  Because the collection of songs is so random here, and it's quite a bit stronger than anything on `Debut', I would highly recommend this album to anyone who is a first-time listener of Bjork's work!  There's something for everybody here, and Bjork's vocals are strong and vibrant (but then again, they always are).  The songs here touch on almost every possible emotion, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
B00000DHRZ|4.0|This cd has some great tracks on it, but it also has some crappy ones like \\"pretty fly (for a white guy)\\", \\"she's got issues\\", and \\"why don't you get a job\\" I don't really like any of those tracks, but the rest of the tracks are pretty sweet, I still recommend buying it, but those tracks are the reason for the 4 instead of 5.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie.  For one, I'm used to seeing Alan Rickman in serious roles, and I get a huge kick out of seeing his character smile and laugh near the end.  I actually thought his face would break.  You can tell he and all of the actors had a blast making this film.  I used to be a Trek fan and this movie was a really smart idea.  My favorite characters are Madison/Sigourney Weaver, Lazarus/Rickman, and I really loved Chen/Tony Shalhoub.  I remember wondering, when watching ST:TNG, how they could easily ramble off all those technical terms and Sgt Chen's character really makes a good joke out of that one.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|If you read the first few pages of the insert booklet that is stuffed in the package along with all ten DVDs, you'll read an interesting story about how the Wachowski brothers pitched the idea of running dual commentary tracks with the trilogy.  Apparently the studio was fine with having philosophers Dr. Comel West and Ken Wilber act as scholarly interpretters overtop the movie, but hiring three critics (Todd McCarthy, John Powers, and David Thomson) to rip the story to shreds in a separate but parallel commentary track was beyond the realm of anything anyone had ever done before.  Yes, we all know the surprise was gone by the time the second and third movies made an appearance.  But hold that glittering green and black box in your hand and tell me that encompassed within ISN'T one of the wildest and most cohesive multi-medium (video games, comics, movies, animes) of this century.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|It's funny to see how you bash Slipknot when you yourself don't know what music really is.  I agree with you that acoustic music doesn't need to be light and slow.  Most of the acoustic songs I listen to are pretty moderate speed.  Anyways, you are also infected by the cruel world of media - judging from the reviews you have written.  I want you to open your eyes to better music than grunge 'cause TRUE metal is what real music is.   <br />     By true metal I mean deep underground stuff.  Have you ever heard of bands such as Lamb of God, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, All that Remains, or Unearth?  If you haven't I suggest you are REALLY infected by the media.  These bands are from America and produce awsome metal.   <br />     If you've heard of them, have you ever heard even lower underground bands such as Opeth, Children of Bodom and Soilwork? <br />     If you have, have you heard of the LOWEST possible underground music?  Within Y, Novembre, Amon Amarth, Arsis, Insomnium?  This is real music.  Not Pearl Jam, not Tool, not APC.  I hate media bands with a passion. <br />      <br />      As for Slipknot, they are for posers.  But I can't just give the album a 1 star.  If Slipknot knew their fans were posers, they would be pissed.  I hate kids who listen to hardcore and nu-metal and start dressing up gothicly.  I mean, WTF?  You guys need to grow up.  This album however has its moments.  Even though I hate media metal, I will give points for catchy and emotional music.  I can say the same with bands I hate such as Nirvana.  The \\"heavy\\" songs are just lame.  They depict no talent for a 9-man band and just suck.  This is the kind of music you need to burn.   <br />     My favorite song on here is Duality, then Vermillion Part II 'cause Duality is actually catchy (even though I hate MTV) and Vermillion Part II because it is very emotional.  But when I compare these songs to real metal, I want to puke at the slowness and lack of skill in this band.  Imean, CLOWN from Slipknot bangs on freakin' cans and calls himself a musician -_-
B000001IPL|5.0|This and ignition are the offspring's best albums and some of the top punk cd's ever in my opinion. There isn't a bad track on this album. It's badass punk all the way! Buy this album and ignition today!
0380018179|5.0|I'm not into romance novels, but this book is my absolute favorite.  Why?  That's easy. It's full of adventure, rich details about family and Australia, the building up of passion (not just two people jumping in the sack).  This book is long and it covers several decades of the characters lives, but it's enjoyable to read and you'll find yourself turning the pages so fast and at the same time wanting to savor every moment.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Overall this is a great achievement of both film and sound. The music is incredible. The shots are incredible. Led Zeppelin is incredible. Only 2 things suffer.<br /><br />As one previous reviewer said that \\"Jimmy Page dubbed over one of the guitar track, guitarists take heed\\"....well its actually more like film geeks take heed:: the footage that Jimmy Page wanted to show could not be shown in every shot DID NOT EXIST. this is especially noticeable on the first concert on the DVD, sometimes random zooming in still shots of the bandmembers occur, obviously just to fill up empty space.<br /><br />of course this is promenent on the \\"immigrant song\\" title which has a completely different video track than the audio track.<br /><br />the 2nd thing is well, my musician's head. Jimmy Page is indeed a mastermind, but he messes up so continually it is hard not to fast forward through some of the solo parts.<br /><br />still, i would pay 50 bucks to see bonham's moby dick just once on surround sound.<br /><br />worth the buy.
B000007XUQ|5.0|What can I say?  I have had the priviledge of hearing many Christmas albums in my time, but I have to say that this one ranks near the top.  Along with other greats such as Sinatra, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, etc, Karen Carpenter was undoubtedly one of the finest female singers of her -or any other- generation.  From the opening overture, to the last closing note, the album is solid and well produced.  I DARE anyone not to get chills when they hear Karen sing \\"Ave Maria\\".  Just listen to the resonance of her voice on other classics like \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"Little Altar Boy\\", \\"Do You Hear What I Hear\\", \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\", etc.  Karen never fails in her delivery.   <br /> <br />I really believe these recordings should go down as one of the finest holiday albums ever made.  Even people who aren't really fans of the Carpenters have admitted that it's a timeless holiday album, and one that EVERYONE should have on rotation during the holidays.  (my local radio station gets lots of requests to play this album) On another level, it's also a sad reminder of what we ALL lost that can never be regained.  Thankfully, we have these recordings and we have our wonderful memories.   The world was truly blessed with an angel, if only for a short time.  Don't walk, RUN to the store and buy this CD.  A timeless holiday classic that brings back many fond memories of the way Christmas -and entertainers- used to be like.  A solid 5 star rating.
B000002BPS|5.0|This  is an awesome cd. Every track is cool. Smash and ignition are a little better but this cd still rules.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|Gets my vote for \\"WORST\\" cinematography since \\"Man on Fire\\" with Denzel Washington.  The camera work was so jumpy, and the editing so choppy, that it made me motion sick.  Given my druthers, instead of \\"One Star\\", I would rate it with \\"5 upchucks\\".
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Hello all, I'm LimpBizkit101 ((The guy who wrote Reviews for Vengeance 2003, SS 2003 & RR 2004.)) But since then I forgot my password and I made a new account. But anyway, Lets get on with The Review for Wrestlemania 20! <br /> <br />1.WWE U.S. Championship, Big Show Vs. John Cena. <br />Pretty good match with a good storyline, It all started back in SS where Cena FU'd Big Show costing big show's team the match. I really thought that this match would REALLY, REALLY suck, but it didn't. But still was a Decent matchup with a Predictable ending. 7/10. <br /> <br />2.Raw Fatal Fourway for WTT Title, Dudley Boyz Vs. RVD & Booker Vs. Jindrak & Cade Vs. La' Resistance. <br />WHHHO booked this crap...? Pretty pointless matchup with 2 good teams...Oh, And why the hell are Cade & Jindrak in a Wrestlemania?! They didn't even do a damn thing in this match...Fast Forward please. 5/10. <br /> <br />3.Christian Vs. Y2J. <br />YESSS!!! First good match on the card! Possibly the best Y2J Vs. Christian match...EVER! and there have been what? like 4? Heh. This is what Wrestling is all about. I wanted Christian to win (I'm a CLB Fan &#60;_&#60;;) And I thought he would after that S.I.C.K. DDT, He did win after Trish turned on Y2J and hooked up with Captain Charisma, Sweet a$$ matchup. 9/10. <br /> <br />4.3 on 1 Handicap match, Evolution Vs. Rock N' Sock connection. <br />Overrated? Yes. ***** star match? HELL YEAH! Rock always impresses me and this match was one of the best matches in Mania History! Fast-Paced action all the way, And I didn't even care who were the winners too, It was a good match. 10/10. <br /> <br />5.Cruieserweight Invitational for CW Title. <br />I'm not gonna list who were in this match cuz I'm a lazy *******. Lol, Excellent matchup with many Holy **** moves all the way! Like the Move mysterio did to Kidman & The SSP on the outside to Nunzio and Jamie Noble...Damn what a match...Too bad it ended too early. 8/10. <br /> <br />6.Brock Lesnar Vs. Goldberg. <br />MATCH OF THE DECADE. PERIOD. ...Nah Just kidding, ****ed up match with a ****ed up ending. 1/10. <br /> <br />7.SmackDown! Fatal-Four-Way four TT Titles, Rikishi & Scotty Vs. WGTT Vs.

And I thought The RAW Match sucked! 3/10. <br /> <br />8.WWE Title, Kurt Angle Vs. Eddie Guerrero. <br />Perfection. This had everything...THIS is what all matches should be like. I LOVE Eddie's matches there all ****-***** star matches, Eddie and Kurt work Well with eachother, I have *NEVER* seen a bad match with Kurt or Eddie, Once again eddie cheats 2 win! 10/10. <br /> <br />9.Undertaker Vs. Kane. <br />Eh? O_o That's Undertaker? BOOOO!!! WTF man he didn't even change his f'n attire, He's just a dead Cowboy Who can't put on good matches and No-Sells most of the time...Same as his opponent! The jobber known as Kane. Don't waste your time on this ****, The entrances were the only good things. 4/10. <br /> <br />10.HBK Vs. HHH Vs. Chris Benoit for WHT. <br />Match of the night, What a spectcular way to end the best PPV of 2004. So many great Spots in this match. just stfu and buy the DVD just for this MOTY matchup. 10/10.
B0002858YS|1.0|are you people retarded?  why do you listen to this crap?  it's just fabricated 80's music.  utter crap.   <br /> <br />ugh...ugh...ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004D3C1|5.0|King of the Road stands out as my favorite of Fu Manchu's albums. So take a road trip with this cranking for this is great music for a cruse.  This CD has a great sound!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|at this point it feels like most of the former mac-ers would rather be driving their kids to soccer practice than jamming out in front of sold-out crowds. given the so-so success of this album and subsequent tour, i don't think it's too brash to suggest that Stevie, Lindsay, Mick and John join their former band-mate and tend to a bit more domestic matters.
B00067BBQE|2.0|I expected to see a concert video. Concert videos never capture the emotion or power of a live concert but can still give a good feeling for the artist's stage presence. With her magnificent voice I really looked forward to seeing how Amy Lee performs in concert. Instead I saw the work of a wanna-be music video editor who has no concept of what he's doing. During songs like My Last Breath and Everybody's Fool where Amy builds lyrically and musically to a climax with the chorus the editor carefully avoided showing her at the climax, frustrating the viewer who wants to see her connect with the audience. In true music video form no shot lasts more than 1-2 seconds, ruining the emotional impact of Amy's music.<br /><br />If whoever had creative control over this DVD had simply copied the Cranberries' Paris concert video it would have been wonderful. Instead it was a total waste of my time and money.<br /><br />Way back in ancient times (before Amy was even born) I did lights for concerts. Never did I think I was anything more than a medium to enhance the artist. Unfortunately, the producer and editor of this video think they are more important than Amy and her band. I still look forward to someday seeing what she is like in concert. Can't tell from this horror.
B00005JLXE|5.0|when I first saw the theatrical version of daredevil there were a few scenes that seemed suspicous. one of the biggest clues that something wasn't quite right was the inclusion of coolio as \\"dante jackson\\" in the credits at the end of the film since there hadn't been any \\"dante jackson\\" or coolio anywhere in the film! i also wished there had been more kingpin. both of these things have been corrected thanks to director's cut and it's a much superior cut of the film. dante jackson plays a very vital role and there's also more kingpin and i love it! did you like daredevil the theatrical version? then check out this version. you can't go wrong with the director's cut of daredevil.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the most expensive and best cinematic presentation of the third movie installment of J.K. Rowling's continuing children's book series. <br />The actors have matured a bit, and so has their acting with each movie (I believe all three of the main characters to have promising futures for their roles in the movies). The first two movies, while still magical, lacked somewhat.  The feeling was that of an over-budgeted BBC TV special. <br /> <br />Though I love the books, I can't help but feel the movies deserve better treatment.  I am a fan nonetheless and am thrilled with the excitement of the upcoming \\"...Goblet of Fire\\".  Hopefully, our young actors will hit it on the nose.  But what do I know.  I'm just a silly Muggle.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|I bought this DVD today and watched it three times. I have never ever watched a single dvd three times in one day. I dont even know if I've watched one twice in the same day. I'm not a hardcore white stripes fan, but I definetely liked them enough to pick up this DVD on the day it came out, becuase i've heard a few bootlegs and know they had quite a good live show. Now I'm kicking myself for not going to see them last time they were in town! Seriously, this DVD is only second to the great Led Zeppelin DVD released last year. If you at all consider yourself a fan of the White Stripes, pick up this DVD, these live versions surpass the studio versions in most of the songs.
B0002DB52M|3.0|My partner and I were both annoyed by the loudness of the narration relative to the dialogue of the actors.  We kept turning the volume up, down, up, down .  We rented the DVD, no way of knowing if they're all like that. <br /> <br />We didn't understand the message of the movie, but I'm kind of hoping that Grace represents Mother Nature.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta began with the breakup of the band At the Drive-In.  As opposed to their brother band, Sparta, the Mars Volta has created a completely new way to approach music.  And it works.  And its good.  As well as really weird. <br /> <br />And thats all I have to say.
B000267JQK|1.0|I picked up this album because I love Evanescence and it had the version of broken with Amy Lee.  The band is techically solid (they can play there instruments fine), but overall it is musically fairly generic.  Not bad, but not good.  Lyrically, it is atrocious.  Let's take this fine example <br /> <br />I wanna waste her monthly blood <br />Wanna get some on my love  <br /> <br />How old is this band?  13? <br /> <br />The band is the anti-Evanescence.  There is nothing that stands out and the lyrics take away from the music.  I have nothing against \\"crude\\" lyrics as long as they mean something.  Stinkfist and Prison Sex by Tool are great examples that are ruder than the lyrics of Gasoline, but that have a point. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and pick up another band.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This is just a film by Michael Moore in what appears to be a vendetta against George W Bush. It is interesting to watch \\"Fahrenhype 9/11\\" after watching this movie. Why does Moore have a section about the Oregon State Police when it is funded by Oregon State and not the federal government? The most appalling thing about this obvious piece of propaganda is that Moore claims he is behind and supports the soldiers in Iraq %100. Why is there not one positive image of a soldier throughout the entire film? He depicts them as uneducated, brutal savages for his own gain.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|When this CD came out it was perfect.  The uptempo beats, all of the childish themes were just great.   But now Christina and her fans have grown and matured.  Don't get me wrong i still love this CD and it is in my xmas rotation along with Jessica and Mariah, but I would love it if she released another xmas CD, it could be called, \\"My OTHER-kind of christmas\\" and she could even do some of the same songs, but more classics, and just her and like a harp and piano, and ofcourse on some of the bigger songs a full orchestra, I wish she did one that wasn't so teen-pop(Not thats there anything wrong with that) like her rendtion of Silent Night on \\"Platinum Christmas\\" that was amazing.  The first one will do but I am praying that she records another one.
B000669GAI|5.0|your an idiot, pearl jam doesn't make videos, sell their songs for commercials, [...] themselves out on mtv, or sell themselves at all.  if they wanted, they would still be the biggest band on the planet.  and creed put out a greatest hits album, what does that make them. and scott stapp has a serious jesus complex.   and they suck.  they just don't rip of pearl jam, they rip off alice in chains, soundgarden, stone temple pilots and pretty much every other great band from the early 90's.    anyway, this is a great purchase for the casual pearl jam fan and of course a must have for the collector.

B00004Y6NP|4.0|Dire Straits 5th album - of 6 studio albums - played a hand in defining 1980s pop music. \\"Money for Nothing\\" became a pop anthem that criticized the very medium itself. Mark Knopfler even publicly apologized for it on MTV by saying \\"No offense\\". Apparently even he couldn't believe how popular it became. The song takes stinging jabs at artists who make boatloads of money but, according to the character in the song, don't actually work, or at least produce nothing of real value. Nonetheless, the same character shows bottomless envy for those who earn their \\"checks for free\\". Background vocals by Sting (who was as big as solar prominence in 1985) didn't hurt the song's popularity. The band's appearance at 1985's Live Aid, complete with Sting, led to a classic comment by an MTV VJ: \\"Who would expect Sting and Dire Straits together?\\" Well, they did collaborate on an album, so it wasn't really that big of a shock. Then the video (with its now blocky and primitive-looking computer graphics) came out and the song catapulted to nearly everywhere. No one could escape, even if they wanted to.<br /><br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\" follows the typical template of Dire Strait's other albums: A couple of absolutely incredible songs, many great songs, and a few merely good ones (total duds are exceedingly rare). Overall, the album begins with astonishing momentum, dips down quite a bit, and slowly climbs its way back to a level somewhat below the beginning. Without doubt the strongest songs are the first three. All were hits. Then \\"Your Latest Trick\\" suddenly dips the adrenaline down somewhat, and \\"Why Worry\\" dips it down even further, almost to a soporific level. Then the pace begins to build again with \\"Ride Across the River\\" and it doesn't let up until the great closing title track. \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" is a vastly underrated song hidden on what was once \\"Side Two\\". Some of Knopfler's best lyrics also hide here. The chunky guitar driven \\"One World\\" kicks the pace up after a series of mid-tempo songs. The closing title track is another unjustly overlooked song. It's disturbing, beautiful, and forlorn. Knopfler's trademark volume-pedal-assisted guitar appropriately pervades the song.<br /><br />One could debate about whether or not \\"Brothers in Arms\\" deserves the title \\"Best Dire Straits Album\\". In some ways it does and in some ways it doesn't. In the end, it really doesn't matter, it's still a great album with some of the greatest 80s pop ever recorded.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Dire Strait's peak also signaled the beginning of the end of the band. The follow-up \\"On Every Street\\" didn't even come close to the commercial popularity of \\"Brothers In Arms\\" (though the band must be given loads of credit for not putting out a carbon copy of their mega-seller). Following a few live albums, Dire Straits appears to have disappeared altogether. Knopfler is still recording and releasing albums (his latest was released this past September and charted all over the world), but the reign of Dire Staits clearly ended sometime in the late 1980s. Still, they left behnd some great music, and provided a breath of fresh air in the sometimes stultifying 1980s pop scene.f mid-tempo songs.

0446605409|4.0|I read Lion's Game first, so my introduction to John Corey was a little out of order. My first DeMille book was Charm School and I fell in love with his work then. Lion's Game was better than Plum Island for Corey's quirky, eccentric characteristics, but he's such an interesting guy, you have to love him. The action is good. This book is a little predictable, but fun anyway. After these two Corey books, I do wonder how he ends up with the women, though.......Excellent author. I would always recommend Nelson DeMille.

0385508417|1.0|My enjoyment in this book was ruined by Mr. Grisham's use of a racist gag.  Without \\"spoiling\\" for others a book now quite spoiled for me, I will simply say this:  Mr. Grisham's \\"happy ending\\" included the fact that a certain character turned out not to have \\"dark skin,\\" to the dear, sweet Kranks' \\"relief.\\"  Appalling.  I cannot think why Mr. Grisham chose to endow his protagonists with this openly racist attitude.  It had nothing to do with the story or its theme.  I hope that in future Mr. Grisham will refrain from including gratuitous racist gags in his books.  He and his publisher should also keep in mind that people of color read -- and purchase -- books, too.
B000002UTY|5.0|it's too bad the QSM dont get the attention they deserve, this is one killer album, definitely worth buying. the guitar work on this album is incredible.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Let me first say that I'm not one to travel off the beaten path in music.....Maybe because I'm a teenager and taking the time to go get a CD (and that in turn means spending my money) means I better like all the music I get on that album or I'm pretty ticked (this may account for the shallow depth in my CD collection)....By the way, having an awesome sound system in your car makes this CD even more awesome--trust me. <br />\\"Gorillaz\\" fortunately is not a one-trick pony. <br />When you first get your hands on the album (via stealing from your sister) you feel impatient trying to get to all the songs you can possibly recognize (i.e. Clint Eastwood and 19-2000) and then you go back to the beginning to see what you missed. <br /> <br />1)Re-Hash: What I like to call 'Sunday Afternoon' music (think about how you feel on Sundays and you'll get it). Its upbeat, mellow and with some great bass. <br />2)5/4: Now here's where that kid who wrote about the CD seeming \\"goth\\" would probably base their argument. The song is about a guy who likes a girl who in turn, turns on his dad, which makes him depressed and suicidal. I know that suicide is extremely morbid, but the song is so ironic that I find it hillarious in a good way. <br />3)Tomorrow Comes Today: Darker/moodier. The echoed voices are chilling but the melody really hooks you. In my opinion, the whistling, while seeming upbeat, really seems sad. A good song--sad, but good. <br />4)New Genius: This is my favorite song on the album. Its dark and I believe has some serious paranoia undertones but dont let that put you off. The music in this song is the best. Part mellow/part james bond-esque (when they make the next movie they should somehow find a way to work this song into the soundtrack) <br />5)Clint Eastwood: Forget what anyone says about the beats or the hooks in this song. The only thing that you should really be concerned with is Russel's (Del Tha Funkee Homosapien) rhymes. This is what rap is about. Gritty and smooth at the same time. Call it the Snickers Bar of the bunch (mmmm....snickers) <br />6)Man Research: Space Odyssey of their album.I hear this song & cant help but think I'm missing something but thats okay. The indian chants/crying man (cant distinguish) is heartbreaking. <br />7)Punk: Apart from being so much fun to clap/stomp along to its got wicked almost arcade-like sound effects. The only negative is that its only 1:36 long... <br />8)Sound Check/Gravity: Its starts off with what sonds like crickets in the background and then vocals and then boom (this is where what I was talking about having a kickass sound system pays off). This with 'New Genius' is a fave. <br />9)Double Bass: Arcade bits in here too but the lack of lyrics is surprisingly refreshing. The pace of the beats is slow but not too slow (like when you walk when you have no place in particular to go) But the two line blurb halfway through the song throws me for a loop so if I'm interpreting it wrong I'm sorry. <br />10)Rock the House: the very dance-friendly song that gets all the wallflowers to get up off their derriers and dance. 70's reminiscent trumpetes and Del's rhymes are melodic and just plain fun. \\"Tap you toes & clap your hands/C'mon trace the globe & shake your pants/Just twist your hip & do the dip/C'mon Shake 'n Bake do whatever it takes\\" Harmless almost campy lyrics that your mother could listen to. But not corny. <br />11)19-2000: Funky almost trippy lyrics that have something to do with Nike Shoes. Who cares what the spiritual meaning of this song is.....just listen to it. La la la la/La la la la/La la la la la la la.... <br />12)Latin Simone: Well this has to be the best Spanish song I've ever known (granted I only know this one and the macarena, but whos counting?) They weren't kidding when they decided to bring in talent from all fields of music. Ibrahim Ferrer needs to do a follow up with the Gorillaz in their next album which releases this spring. I adore his voice. <br />13)Starshine: A song to bring you back down from Latin Simone's heights. It does its purpose. You get a real feeling of isolation in this song. <br />14)Slow Country: A lot of people hate this song (and when I say hate I mean somewhat dislike because no one I know really hates this) Its just another slower song so a lot of people skip it, but I like it (wow who would have guessed). If you have lived in the city and then lived in the country like I have and then moved back to the city, all you remember about the country was the slow pace (the pace is quite slow in this song) and how there was no one surrounding you like you were in the city. You feel almost homesick for the lights and noise, but at the same time know why you like it out there (the lack of it) <br />15) M1 A1: I swear once you get past the like two-minute intro (it is a very long tribute to 'Day of the Dead') the pace jars you back into the consciousness that you might have lost listining to the past two songs. A rock song that you wouldnt be surprised to find drunk guys singing along to on kareoke night. <br />16)Dracula: Probably the most sexy song on the album (it could just be the fact Dracula is in it but hey) You feel like you are at the end of a dance and everyone has left and the DJ has put this on just for the few who have stayed. Slow but not heavy. <br />17)Left-Hand Suzuki Method: Believe it or not the title refers to how to play a violin hence the violin in the background (I know others of you had your own ideas...) and this is the only song in which Noodle takes center stage. Now if you know Japanese, I could be wrong, but I think the lyrics are the same just in two languages, yell at me you Japanese-speakers if I am wrong. <br />**Hidden Track: I like it better. Very very upbeat. Lyrics are different, just 2-D's little refrain and the piano loop are about the only things that make this song at one time Clint Eastwood. But I'm not berating it. It's different alright, but if you put your personalfeelings aside from the original, you may find that you really like this remix.  <br /> <br />Hope the details give you an idea about what you're getting.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|\\"Radio GaGa\\" by Queen, \\"Bad\\" by U2, \\"Forever Young\\" by Patti Labelle and \\"Heroes\\" by Bowie are alone worth the 28 bills to a very worthy and still vital cause. I know, I know, most of the tapes were destroyed or lost over the years but with all of the VCRs working overtime that day, somewhere in the back of someone's closet lies some missing magic. I wish that a call would have been put out to get everything pulled together to make this a complete day regardless of quality or source. Kudos though for the awesome attempt. A nice addition to any DVD library. Perfect? Far from it. Enjoyable? You bet.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Although this documentary has nothing to do with the Bush administration, I find it very relevant to what is happening in the world today.  It is basically a collection of interviews with Robert McNamara where he talks about the eleven lessons he learned from Vietnam and World War II.  If only the Bush administration would heed his advice.  Highly recommended.

0380789035|4.0|\\"American Gods\\" has Neil Gaiman revisiting familiar territory.  He has explored the notion of fading Gods clinging to whatever shreds of belief they can grasp during his famed \\"Sandman\\" run at DC comics, but having an entire novel to expand on those brief nuggets create a notable, fast reading book.<br /><br />Shadow, the protagonist, is a large, introverted man who finds himself in jail for three years after a heist.  He longs for freedom to return to his wife, and patiently waits for his release by fitting in, not causing trouble, and learning coin tricks.  His world is turned upside down a couple of days before his scheduled release, and once out in the world, he meets an older, one-eyed man who goes by the name Wednesday (if one knows the source for the names of the days of the week, the identity is of this character is instantly revealed), and Shadow is drawn into a conflict that he can barely comprehend, involving characters one never thought to see face to face.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman has a facility with words, having a gift to bring the supernatural to everyday life and make it seem as if it belongs here.  The book, although lenghty, does not feel long, except for some brief interludes that explain how certain gods from various pantheons find themselves here.  The plot is coherent, and the characters well developed.  However, because Mr. Gaiman presents the narrative through Shadow's perspective, except for the interludes and for a couple of chapters towards the end of the book, the antagonists are not given as much depth and exposition as the protagonists.  It would have been interesting to learn some of the back stories of opposing side and more attention paid to their motivations.<br /><br />All in all, a strong outing by a writer who seems to improve after each title.  As an aside, there are some graphic descriptions of violence in the book as well as specific sexual references, which could offend some readers, and this title is definitely not appropriate for younger readers.priate for younger readers.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I was thinking of buying the dvd recently, and I'm glad I waited, because a two-disc special edition is coming out soon and I want that one!  I made the mistake before of buying the \\"Top Gun\\" Soundtrack on cd BEFORE they rereleased it with new songs added on (\\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\", \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" and \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\\") which I thought should have been included on the soundtrack the first time.  It's about time this film gets the special features it deserves on dvd, with four music videos, which I'm assuming will be \\"Danger Zone\\", \\"Playing With The Boys\\", \\"Take My Breath Away\\" and \\"Heaven In Your Eyes\\".  As I have never seen any of those music videos, I can't wait to see them for the first time.    \\"Top Gun\\" is one of my favorite 1980s films and the best Navy movie ever made.  True, it's not an entirely realistic portrayal of Navy life, but this film probably did more to influence me to join the Navy and request to be assigned on an aircraft carrier than anything the Navy recruiter might have promised me.  As a teenager, \\"Maverick\\" was my idol...the person I most wanted to be.  I liked that he broke the rules, even if it got him in trouble.  He was cool and cocky, just like the actual Navy pilots I did get to meet on the USS GW in the early 1990s.  This film, of course is reflective of the time in which it was made...the Cold Warrior days of Reagan before glastnost and perestroika, though it's interesting how much this film must have influenced our current president's need to act all \\"Top Gun\\" himself and flying out the USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003.  \\"Top Gun\\" will probably always be remembered as the perfect cinematic reflection of the Reagan years and the film that brought super-stardom to Tom Cruise, who graduated out of the brat pack/\\"outsiders\\" band with the success of this film.    This film is immensely watchable and enjoyable.  It has everything you could want in a motion picture experience:  humor, action, melancholy drama, love scene, a rocking soundtrack and the inevitable uplifting message about not giving up in the face of difficulties, as the \\"Top Gun Anthem\\" undoubtedly cues you into.  It's not a masterpiece that was Oscar worthy of a Best Picture nomination or anything like that, but on its own merits, this one is the top of its genre.  Since its release, there have been many imitators and wannabes (\\"Days of Thunder\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\", \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" to name a few), but none comes close to the thrill and adrenaline rush of this film.  I'm looking forward to watching with the commentary track to hear what the Navy experts have to say, because I remember that this film caused an uptick in Navy recruitment and I'll be honest in admitting that my own enlistment in the Navy was strongly influenced by this film.  Being on an aircraft carrier really is worth an enlistment and \\"Top Gun\\" is probably more accurate than any other Navy film I've seen.  Highly recommended...and you'll want the special edition soundtrack as well, if you don't have that one yet.  Take a ride into the danger zone.
B00030590I|3.0|As another reviewer mentioned, this is a beautiful movie, extremely well executed, but with a political message that I simply could not embrace. <br /> <br />The quick synopsis is this: The Emperor of Qin, in his bid to unite all of the kingdoms of China, has made many enemies.  Among these, the most formidable are Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow, a trio so terrifying that the Emperor refuses to allow anyone within 100 paces, and has offered thousands of gold pieces for their heads.  Along comes Nameless, a lowly bureaucrat from one of the interior provinces, who claims to have bested all three and wants to an audience with the Emperor.  That being allowed to come within 10 paces of the Emperor is part of the reward for defeating the three assassins presents an interesting enigma to be solved. <br /> <br />In terms of artistry, this movie has few equals.  Jet Li, one of the premier martial artists in movies today, delivers a convincing performance as the Nameless champion, and the remaining principal actors, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen, and Ziyi Zhang offer dramatic presence and martial artistry.  The visual palette of the movie, the striking choice of colors (each separate battle and its retelling offers a different primary color), and the literal cast of thousands (most of the crowd scenes, except for a few obviously CGI long shots of massing armies, seem to be composed of actual actors) create an incredible experience for the viewer. <br /> <br />However, the politics are deeply flawed.  In brief, this is an apologist's excuse for the authoritarian Chinese government.  It is clear, after watching the movie, why the Chinese government has wholeheartedly supported this film (the mere presence of hundreds of extras seem to suggest that quite a few strings were pulled to facilitate its fimling, as well as extensive use of majestic locales, such as the main palace, desolate vistas, etc.).  The emperor even has a line where he says (paraphrasing) \\"People think I am a tyrant, but only he understood me\\" (where the idea is that unifying the country and maintaing its stability are the loftiest of goals).  Basically, the message is that the people of China should be proud to be members of this great country, not dissent and follow the orders of the puzzling, sometimes tyrannical government, because deep down, they want what is best for the people.  The government is merely misunderstood, and heavy handed tactics, such as wipping out defenseless studends in caligraphy school (in the movie) or defenseless students protesting in a square (in real life) should be viewed in the light of patriotism and national pride/security.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|This collection has some new songs on there that would make this worth getting for one's music library, including hits from his Jackson 5 days...however, I'm weary about buying anything from him now because of his legal problems, which are serious issues that need to be resolved for the sake of children's lives, and his monstrous ego-vanity and wanton materialism, which buying this would only contribute further to his long-running slide away from reality and norms of society.  If you really want this for your collection, please consider waiting and buying it used.  Its obvious that MJ's best days are far behind him and he has to keep repackaging old hits with promises of new, unreleased songs from his archives.  Yes, I'm interested to hear them, but not enough to financially support a person I believe needs serious psychological help.  I like MJ and appreciate the great music and videos he brought to the world, but there's no reason why fans should continue to support his slow descent into madness.  His musical arc represents one of the greatest tragedies in pop music history...a brilliant flame ruined by the inability to top his early and overwhelming success of \\"Thriller\\".  The fame went to his head, so please don't financially support him by buying this album.  There are more worthwhile artists and causes to support with our money.  Sorry, Michael, but you're \\"gone too soon\\", so please take a look at the man in the mirror and make that change!

B0006399FS|5.0|I can't express how much I love this CD. I wasn't around for U2's earlier stuff so my main frame of reference is their best of albums and All That You Can't Leave Behind, but I feel as though they're getting better as the years go on. \\"Original of the Spieces\\" is my favorite track, but I love them all, so it's very hard to pick one song to be the best. But I've been listening to this CD nonstop since it came out and I just can't get enough of it!
079074404X|5.0|As soon as I heard the \\"electronic tonalities\\" accompanying the opening credits, I knew this was going to be a great movie.  I still enjoy listening to that strange sound that perfectly set the mood for a futuristic adventure, there has never been any better.      It's often said that the script was based on Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest,\\" well maybe...but very loosely.  But it was certainly a tightly written and logical story.  As a nine-year old I didn't understand what became of the monster, but that just made it more interesting when I saw it again many years later.    The special effects were good for the time and still hold up OK today.  But I dread going to see the remake.  Somehow I suspect that so much will have to be changed to fit in with today's ideals.  Such as:  Altaira will have to be more of a \\"Zena the Warrior Princess\\" type and not a sex object, so as not to offend the femminists.  The remake would probably also contain dark conspiracies and lots of gratuitous sex and violence.  Of course Robby would have to be black.    I know why this movie became such a classic for me: To own my own planet, complete with ancient civilization to explore, and a robot companion--what more could any nine-year old boy ask for?  That leaves Altaira.  I didn't know why, but even back then I thought it would be nice to keep her around.  I was certainly right about that!
B000002L9J|5.0|Johnny Marr is an incredible guitar player.  I just wanted to say that first, because Moz usually gets all the press.  Anyway, The Queen Is Dead is the album I usually turn to first - songs like Cemetary Gate keeps me coming back for more.  My only complaint about this album is it's length.  I really wish they'd written 10 more songs at the same time and put them on this album.
B000679N96|4.0|The Cure's debut album Three Imaginary Boys was for a long time only available as an import. In the US it was repackaged and re-released ( with a few newly recorded singles taking the place of a few songs from TIB ) as Boys Don't Cry ( I still have the original vinyl version as well as the re-released cd version.)  Here is the deluxe reissue of TIB with an extra disc of demos and home recordings. It still sounds good and  the songs still stand up, despite the fact they were at the time a 3 piece band. A few minor compaints: the liner notes are somewhat skeletal ( although I like the inclusion of many never before seen photos ) the tone of the quotes from singer/guitarist/leader Robert Smith is somewhat pessimistic ( griping about certain songs, feeling he had no control over the artwork, STILL dissing Lol Tolhurst , etc) and several of the songs on the bonus disc are readily available somewhere else ( why oh why are we presented with Boys Don't Cry and  Jumping Someone Else's Train AGAIN ?? Although they are  great songs, they have already been on the cd  Standing on a Beach singles compilation, as well as the US pressing of the Boys Don't Cry cd ). These few complaints aside, this is a great document of the early development of one of the greatest British post-punk bands. If you don't have Three Imaginary Boys I can highly recommended this cd for fans of bands like Wire, XTC, the Jam and Gang of Four.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|I must confess: I don't care for Will Farrel. Watching him on Saturday Night Live was like taking a cheese grater to my hand. This was the first movie of his that I saw, and I did so only because my roommate assured me that it was warm and entertaining. <br /> <br />From the very beginning, with Bob Newhart's understated delivery, and the intriguing imagery that followed as the beginning credits rolled accompanied by warm Christmas music, I knew that he was right. Elf was going to be something special. <br /> <br />The concept of a human being raised by elves at the North Pole is an intriguing and original one, as far as I'm aware. So the movie gets credit for that. At some point, of course, the \\"misfit\\" who can't fit into his bed, and can barely get into the bathroom, needs to find his real family. So, by himself (and this is slightly unrealistic - wouldn't he be accompanied by someone or something: New York isn't a place for an adult child who thinks he's an elf; in the \\"real\\" world, he would have been dead in an hour) he seeks out his real father. Who, as it happens, is on the \\"naughty list\\". <br /> <br />His father, as it turns out, works in children's book publishing. I can not for the life of me imagine a more innappropriate job for that man to hold. He's callous, unkind, doesn't seem to be interested in children - and those aren't qualities that lend well to the creation of children's books. Nevertheless...it is a good fit for the ending. <br /> <br />Farrell pulls off the innocent elf gig pretty well. Despite some uncomfortable moments (him dancing on a table on the mail room - that was a bit over the top), his performance was believable. Less believable was the pretty blonde girl falling for him, but we are being asked to suspend disbelief, and I think we can do so with that. <br /> <br />I'm not sure that I'd watch it over and over, and I wouldn't say that it has found its place in the canon of Christmas classics, but I would watch it again, and it is a decent Christmas film. <br /> <br />However, I'm probably wrong. It will probably be played on television every Christmas for the next fifty years.
B00004Y6NK|2.0|I recently gave this one another listen and it still disappoints me.  Eric was lost for directions at this time and it shows in this recording.  He says it clearly in \\"Holy Mother\\" which is one of the very few high points on this album.  I do like \\"Tearing us apart\\" but even that energetic song doesn't age well in time.  Thank God he found his path again with the wonderful \\"Journeyman\\" cd later on but this one reflects a very uncreative stage of his marvelous career.  Skip it.

That is always nice to see in a movie, a woman with a strong character who actually wers clothes that cover more than just the bare necessities.  <br /> <br />2. Seth Green makes a great geek. He was born to be a geek. <br /> <br />3. It will make you laugh, or at least utter a chuckle from time to time. <br /> <br />4. The movie has great action scenes and the plot is interesting. <br /> <br />Now on to the negatives: <br /> <br />1. Not all of the cast members' acting was up to par (*cough* Wahlberg *cough*). He is nice to look at but good acting that does not make.  <br /> <br />2. There are dry moments. When the action slows down it may be hard at certain moments to keep you eyes open. Good if you are on a date or need to go to the bathroom.  <br /> <br />3. Although the plot is interesting, there are no underlying philosophical or higher brain function twists. The plot is straight forward, the good guys win (as always). It is interesting to see how they win...  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a movie to sit around, relax, and shut your brain off while watching pretty pictures and interesting action then this is the movie for you. I bought the DVD just for that reason... a long day, put my feet in a foot massage bath thingie, shut off all cognitive actions in my brain, and stare at the TV with drool on the side of my mouth.
B000002JAX|5.0|Dreamland is recorded in HDCD format. It can nonetheless be played with any, standard, CD/DVD player, however it sounds better on a machine that can interpret HDCD code. HDCD recordings do, however, sound better than regular recordings even when played on standard machines. And DREAMLAND SOUNDS GREAT. It is one of my three or so reference CD/audio DVDs. The bass is very good: clear and deep. The piano solos will give you goose bumps on your goose bumps. Her voice is smooth, never harsh or piercing. If you have a good system with good speakers, you will keep going back to this recording to judge the quality of other CDs.<BR>I have grown to like all the songs on this album.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I am probably biased because this was my favorite movie from childhood, but this is still one of the best movies ever made. I have so many pleasant childhood memories associated with it. The cover looks amazing and it has many extra features although I haven't gone through any of them except for the three versions of the movie. I still like the original version the best but it is interesting to watch the other two and compare.  This should be one of childhood movies that every kid should see.  <br /> <br />Some people criticise this DVD by saying that the colors don't look as great but I haven't noticed. I guess I may not pay as much attention to details but to me the DVD is enjoyable to watch and the colors seem just fine.
B0000C1733|5.0|I don't care who you are or if you do not have any interest in this music.  You don't even have to hear one of these songs to know that The red hots are still the \\"hottest\\" in the business.  I recently went to purchase this CD because I couldn't find my copy of Californication.  Yes, Shame on me for losing something so wonderful.  In my defense it was almost to scratched to play.  Anyways, I came across this CD and it had on 5 of the most wonderful songs ever.  The first song to catch my eye was Under the bridge.  By far one of the best guitar solo's ever.  The second was Californication.  By far one of the most intense lyrics since Nirvana's Lithium.  THe third song was Scar tissue.  A song, i remember loving back in 5th grade.  The 4th song was Otherside.  Outstanding vocal's in this song, it almost makes me want to cry.  Lastly, By the way.  An honest song in the style on of the greatest band of the ninties ever.  If you don't buy this CD for yourself then I suggest you buy it for someone you love.  Especially, young artistic student's like myself.  But, DOn't get me a copy of this CD, I already have it.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand, a band out of Scotland that is new to the scene, blasts away with their debut self-titled CD, one of the best of 2004! This debut album of the band Franz Ferdinand is an intense, rocking celebration of an album with many new tunes so incredible you're going to want more the moment the CD ends! For now we must be content with this effort and hope they turn out another CD soon! GRIN<br /><br />The album begins with a strong start: \\"Jacqueline\\" and \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" are very powerful with good beats and rhythm. This leads into \\"Take Me Out,\\" a song about assassins daring each other to kill. \\"Take Me Out\\" begins with a type of pop/punk beat that eventually changes into a dance-type beat. Interesting and very, very good! Another song, \\"Michael,\\" has a great beat and is very candid about sexuality. The song \\"Auf Acshe\\" has a strong disco beat, just to show they can do practically any type of music! There's also the song \\"This Fire,\\" which has a very strong, energetic rhythm that will make you want to chant along with it!<br /><br />If you want fresh talent and a great time listening to it over and over again, get this CD! Honestly, the songs on Franz Ferdinand are so damn good you'll have a hard time putting the CD away. This won't be gathering dust on your CD shelf! Get this and enjoy it! AND, where's their second album? GRIN
1400032717|5.0|In anticipation of some free time on my hands, I went to the book store and snagged a copy of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.  On the surface, it isn't all that deep and it isn't all that complex, though what it lacks in language might very well be the strength of this book.  The narrator's voice made the main charater leap from the page in a three-dimensional manner.  His awkwardness and innocence immediately came to life and the reader is automatically able to compassionately follow the journey the narrator takes.  It was one of those books where I was forced to randomly state \\"let me just finish this chapter\\" because I never wanted to put it down.  It is a wonderful book that is a refreshing change from the typical book.
B0000029J5|5.0|This 1994 disc is real, acoustic, raw blues.  If you've been turned off to Keb' Mo' by his more recent poppy silly stuff, then go back to this one and remember why you liked him in the first place.  Some nice slide work, some love songs, a couple of EXCELLENT Robert Johnson covers.  A solid disk.  He may have lost it recently, but a while back Keb' Mo' used to be about something.
0385508417|4.0|Here's a light entertainment that can be quickly read and enjoyed in two or three sittings, perhaps while you defiantly sip egg nog. By now, you've probably heard about the plot. A couple astonishs and angers their friends when they declare that they are skipping all the shopping, decorating and other chores associated with Christmas. The narrative is not as well written or plotted as Grisham's better known and deservedly more appreciated suspense novels. Yet it's a clever story, with some homespun insight into how neighborhood pride can run amok. The humor is more situational than witty, occasionally relying on slapstick. But the ending wraps it all up into a pleasant enough package.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I think saying this all very simply will convince you. It's a great album...bottom line. I think we can skip all this talk about previous albums, and about what kind of music we're used to hearing from Green Day. Just go buy this album. It's insanely great. It has some songs that are sooo catchy, and it's just awesome. You'll love it. There's no doubt about it. Fantastic...  <br />BUY IT!
0913866156|5.0|I don't understand what people are on about saying this deck isn't for beginners.    I've had nothing but success with this deck. I'm lucky to have gotten a deck that was neither faded or tinted green.    The deck I found to be more accurate than the Rider-White deck and it's derivatives. Also it doesn't divide the cards into a positive or negative aspects. Instead you have to actually think and look at how the cards all relate to each other to get a reading.    I loved this and the spread is better than the Celtic Cross that only looks at past-present-future. The spread here looks at influences and possible futures as well as what is affecting the situation and what is influencing the event and what if anything can be done to affect this. The cards can also be linked to the Kabala and Astronomy for even more in depth analyzes.    I haven't learned enough to use this aspect yet. But when I will I can only grow with this deck. As I learn more and more.    All I can say is buy this deck. But make sure the cards are okay. If you can look at the cards in the box.     If the Box isn't green chances are your okay.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have always kind of liked Green Day with their rather silly songs and own International Superhits and Dookie. However, when I heard American Idiot I knew I had to have this CD. I am in love! After listening to the entire album, I found that American Idiot is the worst song, and it is still very good. The two five part songs, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming are both amazing. I can't decide which I like better. I listened to this nonstop, and in three days had every song memorized. This is the best album I have ever heard. I know there are quite a  few fans of \\"old Green Day\\" who don't like American Idiot because it strays far from albums like Dookie. If you like the kind of songs that are in Dookie, that's what you should listen to. I am quite eager to see what their next album has in store, and whether they are going to do a movie of American Idiot. All I have to say is: BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005AQGH|5.0|A lot of people don't like this album because his final message was f**k Jay-Z, Nas, Mobb Deep, and(hate to say) Biggie. I don't care for the fact that he didn't make peace with B.I.G. before his death, but he didn't know he'd die as soon as he did. I'm sure if he would've went out like Eazy-E, he would've squashed all the beefs, but he didn't get that chance. So people need to realize this wasn't meant to be his last. <br /> <br />This album was a classic, and in my opinion, better than All Eyez On Me. There are a few mediocre songs on the album, such as Just Like Daddy(well, that song's just plain bad), White Man'z World, and To Live And Die In L.A.(overrated). But there's a lot of great songs, such as Hail Mary(one of the creepiest songs ever made), Blasphemy, Me And My Girlfriend(which is a rap classic with some of the best metaphors ever), Life Of An Outlaw, Against All Odds, Krazy, Bomb First(good, dark beat), and Hold Ya Head. So far, this is his best posthumous album, although Loyal To The Game is shaping up quite nicely. I still listen to this album when I need to get away from all the commercial Hip-Pop that invades the airwaves. <br /> <br />If you're a hardcore rap listener, you need this album. But if you still think Jay-Z's the greatest rapper alive, and love Eminem's new album Encore, stay away from this. Because it's not for you.
B000068IEU|3.0|1) Script written by Craven @ 1970-71 on Long Island; film shot in Manhattan (first 15 mins) and Westport/Weston, CT (in daylight) (2) Manson murders, summer of 1969....seemingly random, but if I recall correctly, Manson was aspiring musician and was refused recording contracts...those targeted were related w/recording industry (Polanski was renting house of recording exec.). Krug and Co (the killers in LHOTLeft) kill for the pleasure of it. (3) image/house/men on cover art do not appear in film (4) music written by David Hess, aka Krug...music and sound is used rather skillfully (clashing sound recalls Bonnie and Clyde 1969)(5) acting and script at times very poor (6) shot by someone involved in documentaries, and this film has, intentionally, a documentary feel to it. (7) Very early 70s feel to film...effective/disturbing at times; pathetic at others. (8)Only other Craven film I've seen is 'Deadly Blessing' (81), which I saw in the theater, was 13, and it scared the hell out of me...should be released on dvd soon.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|For the most part I can't stand hardcore/metalcore.  Unearth is some good stuff, though.  There are some who absolutely despise metalcore, and this may or may not change their minds.  However, if you even remotely enjoy metalcore, then this album is essential. <br /> <br />I was already to give this album five stars, but then I realized I was making the same mistake a lot of reviewers were making. I was crediting this as an overall from start to finish fantastic album.  In actaulity, most of the album is quite good but I was so in love with a few choice tracks that it blinded my judgement.  Another reviewer said it best when they said that this album lacks depth. It really fizzls out in the second half. I usually find myself listening to about the half album's worth of standout tracks before putting in a different CD. <br /> <br />This maybe should only get 3.5, but I will round up due to the great musicmanship in a genre that I usually detest.  Definately worth the money.
6305910340|5.0|My 13 and 11 year olds who have played off and on for the past 6 years (not masters) watched it.  My oldest said, \\"It makes me want to play chess again\\".  This was echo'd by my youngest son.  It is inspirational and heartwarming.  I am buying it for CHRISTmas.  We enjoy our father/son battles.  I was pretty good but they now beat me from time to time.  Highly recommended and a nice \\"communication opportunities\\" for you and your kids. <br />A wonderful game - share it with your kids. <br />Greg
B00005Y84D|5.0|I purchased this DVD several years ago. It is made by a company called Panorama, distributed in Hong Kong. The quality is not that grea, in fact it looks like they gave a twelve year old a a camera and told him to have fun but.....who cares? Harrison sings \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" w/ Eric Clapton displaying how to make a guitar weep. Dylan, Billy Preston, and Leon Russell doing a GREAT rendition of Jumping Jack Flash. The spririt of the enterprise is pure George Harrison: music should be a spritual endeavor, and music should ultimately benefit humanity.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is the best new musical staged since Ragtime.  The performances are stellar, the orchestrations move the story beautifully!  Highly recommended! Buy the CD and see the musical when you can!
0226039331|5.0|Logos software now has an CD-Rom edition of this as well as the unabridged 9th of Liddell and Scott.  It makes it a lot easier, no more flipping back and forth between the abbreviation lists if you hover over the abbreviation with the full title will pop up.  Also you no longer have to deal with small typeface.  Check it out they have other stuff in Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Syriac, and Latin.  This is a great tool.  Saves a ton of time.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Furious guitat riff, neck-breaking drums and fill-in, melting solo, with a tast of punk/emo, and some \\"Dream Theatre\\"-ish melodies, and mix them all in one!!! That's what Avenged Sevenfold is all about. If you are metalheadz, guitar-solo-maniac, Mr. Double-bass-drumming-boy, or you are into bands like Shadows Fall, check this out, CAUTION: THE FILLING IS HOT!!! <br /> <br />the guitar duo, along with the duo of Shadows Fall, are no doubt the future of metal guitar duo, crunching riff with flying solo, they are just so fit into each other, and the rhythm is always 200% tight with the drum, they are just locked..... listen to the 2-bar over the bar line rhythm of \\"I Won't See You Tonight - Part 2\\", the intro of \\"Second Heartbeat\\", the double bass break of \\"Desecrate Through Reverance\\" and \\"Remenissions\\", and the intricate rhythm of the chrous of \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\"..... they really show great riff-creating skills, with they superhuman technique on their instruments... <br /> <br />so you might ask, \\"why not 5 stars?\\", yeah this is a 4 stars album, becasue the melodies of most of the tunes is quite weak, i'd say \\"I Won't See You Tonight - Part 1\\" and \\"Remenissions\\" have better molodies, but others seems to be shadowed by the much stronger solos and arrangments.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|<br /> <br />One of the best rap albums ever made.  The Remixes are even better then the original songs on the bonus cds.  Its too bad that there are not any albums like this anymore.  Most rappers have sold out to mainstreem by thinking they need 20 million guests on their albums.
B0000AYL17|5.0|if you have a surround sound setup and Super Audio player, <br />do yourself a favor and purchase this Hybrid SACD of Gaucho. <br />Not only is the original recording hi-fi, but the surround mix is thoughtful, daring, dynamic, and balanced. <br />i've heard many albums done well in surround (The Who's Tommy, Roxy Music's Avalon), but this one is the best sounding. <br />i find myself listening to this a lot.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I gotta admit when I was young I never got into Spiderman stuff, I used to like Batman but when they played the trailer for the movie I really wanted to see and everybody said it was awesome and im like wow, so I finally saw when it first came out on DVD and I absolutly loved it, it became one of my favorite movie, I have Spiderman 2, its way better than the first, but this is still awesome.
6301640659|4.0|After CRUISING came out, I saw the author of the original book interviewed on a NY television news show. He was as confused as most of the audience who saw the film.  \\"It doesn't make any sense,\\" he said. \\"They cut out the principle parts of my book and bowed to pressure.  It's a mess.\\"    I went to see CRUISING at a huge theatre on Broadway and saw it with a packed house. Some guys I personally knew were in the film (I was supposed to audition but had to leave town because Mommy was ill).  I didn't dislike the movie, per se, I just don't like to be blind-folded and led down a dark \\"cul de sac.\\"  This movie was mostly a tease: is Al Pacino getting turned on by all the sex he's witnessing, or, is he just amazed that good-looking gay men, most of whom are as masculine as straight guys, are actually doing these things?  The Central Park, Village and other cruising activity was very realistic and ominous.    Pacino was in a rather dull, \\"let's-eat-and-watch-television\\" type of relationship and was suddenly thrusted into the dark underworld of leather bars and anonymous sex.  It was obvious that the Pacino character was \\"interested\\" in the raunchy goings on at the underground haunts.  He really got caught up in the scene filmed at The Bar in the East Village where he unwittingly sees the killer for the first time.  Al gets swept up in some frenzied dancing and popper sniffing during this scene and actually looked like \\"one of the muscled boys.\\"    On Uniform Night at dark dive, he witnesses some heavy sex activity which included a sling and a can of Crisco.  Freidkin fought like made to keep Al straight, but curious, and I think that he really did have catching the murderer as his #1 priority.  But there were holes in the script.  The main one came when Al felt he had found the killer and where he lived.  He breaks into the guy's apartment, snoops around, but doesn't take anything that might have the guy's fingerprints!  The police have the killer's print on the coin found in the gay book store's porn peep booth.  Al ignores or forgets his training as an undercover cop.  I think he was more interested in \\"getting under the covers\\" with some of those oversexed studs he stared at in the bars.    I hated seeing Malo turning into such a wuss during the stabbing scene in the Times Squre hotel.  He could have taken that guy, or at least fought for his life!    My friend Denny did a wonderful job of cruising the guy who became the second victim who gets stabbed to death in the peep show at the book store over on Eighth Avenue.    And where did the idea come from to put two drag queens in leather and high-heeled boots, stomping through the Village in this mix?!!!.  I've never seen any NY characters like that in real-life!  And then, to have two wayward cops force \\"the girls\\" to have sex in the back of the police car?  Please.  It was nice seeing Keith Prentice (Larry in \\"Boys in the Band\\") as the partner of victim #2.  He was a good actor and should have gotten more work.    You could see Pacino \\"changing\\" during the latter part of the movie. He felt self-conscious about his body after seeing all the perfectly-built gay men and he starts to work out.  His love-making with his girlfriend became rough and abusive while the sounds of the depraved gay-bar-sex played in his head.    At the end (after he has solved the crime), we see Al Pacino, dressed completely in leather, headed for a night out in the sleazy leather bars...    Pacino, gives a realistic, but confused performance (as written and directed) and I enjoyed Paul Sorvino as the police chief.  I liked the film noir quality of this piece, even though it was in color.  The night was dark in this film and the bar scenes, though a bit over-the-top, gave a pretty acurate view of this underworld.    Where's the DVD on this ground-breaking movie?
0385513755|2.0|Come on, people!  This is the masterpiece that's set the publishing world on its ear?  The research is shoddy, the characters are totally flat, and the story limps along like a club footed cow.  It would be impossible to put spoilers in this review, as the entire plot was as transparent as a Scooby Doo episode.  The only amazing thing about this novel is the fact that so many people love it.  Don't ask me why.
B00065JTBA|4.0|I would have preferred if the title of the boxed set was something less amgibuous... after listening to the songs I would have gone for something like 'The Fire Inside', would have reduced the boxed set to 3cds and DVD (instead of 4cds) by leaving out the b-sides. In that way they could have done another boxed set later on with a more inclusive list of all their b-sides! <br />Other than that it's really interesting to see all the songwriting they do before selecting the songs for each album. Some of them do seem like rehashing of other songs (or maybe the hits are improved versions of these?). Anyway the term 'writer's block' doesn't seem to be in the band's vocabulary.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I admit it: with the exception of a few, isolated songs (\\"I'm Every Woman\\", \\"Saving All My Love For You\\", \\"It's Not Right, But It's OK\\", several of the songs from \\"The Bodyguard\\" soundtrack [NOT her mechanical version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\"]), I've never been a fan of Whitney Houston. Her albums have always been a hit-or-(mostly)miss grab bag; for every good track, one must wade through several pop or R&B mediocrities, a reflection not only of poor judgment and production but the simple fact that though she indeed has the pipes, she's never utilized them to their potential (same with Mariah Carey). Her last album, the dreadful \\"Just Whitney\\", the worst-selling of her career, is followed by this, her first Christmas offering, and it could hardly be worse: beyond the annoying, pseudo-R&B settings used for most of these songs, one is struck by the fact that the years of tobacco and substance abuse have left her voice unpleasantly raw. Gone are those high notes she was once noted for; in its place is a noticeable rasp. Whereas such vocal deterioration actually WORKED for Billie Holiday, due partly to such fine choice of material, it only serves to play up the realization that Houston is far, FAR from the top of her game. There isn't a single stand-out track on this collection, though the finale, \\"Joy To The World\\", comes close; her daughter is charming on the beginning verse of \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" but then Whitney charges her way in and ruins it with that damn scale-sliding (melisma is the term for it) she, Mariah, Christina and countless other singers practice. Perhaps once Whitney gets over whatever drugs she's on, and wakes up in the real world, perhaps there will be another - BETTER - album, holiday or otherwise, in her; for now...well, the less said, the better.
B00008LDPU|4.0|There's only one reason that this doesn't get 5/5 and that's because of Program and World Record.  Other than those two, this is perfect.  It's unforgetable.   <br /> <br />Final Flight of the Osiris 4/5 <br />This is the bridge between The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded.  The Osiris descovers the machines drilling to Zion, and all hell breaks loose.  The animation is top notch, and the voice acting is good too.  This is animated by those who did Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and it's kicked up a couple of notches. <br /> <br />Second Renaissance Part I 4.5/5 <br />This is the story of the events that lead up to the war against the machines.  Robots are mistreated slaves.  They are disrespected and ridiculed.  When one robot rebells and kills his owners he is tried, and destroyed by the humans, thus causing an upriding and an enormous riot, which leads to a short fight with rebelling machines.  The riots are stopped, and dead robots are buried. <br /> <br />Second Renaissance Part II 5/5 <br />This IMO is the best of the entire 9 shorts in The Animatrix.  After the riots, machines create their own city called \\"01\\".  There they manufacture robotics and weaponry, along with other technological advancments.  Of course, humans are feeling uneasy against the machines, and when they send embassadors ro make peace, they aren't accepted.  Huamns decide to bomb 01 causing a war.  They blacken the skies to cut off the machines' main source of power.  What happens next is a truly horrific portrayal of humanity's last desperate stand against the machines on a scale that goes beyond any world war.  Humans don't get any second chance and are used as an alternate power source, since the sun is cut off. <br /> <br />Kid's Story 4/5 <br />This is the story of how The Kid comes to know of the matrix.  He is then found out by the agents and has to escape.  The animation is truly visionary due to the fact that The Kid beleives he feels more in real when he dreams than when he is awake. <br /> <br />Program 2/5 <br />This short doesn't seem to fit in at all and plays better as an episode of a long running TV show.  Most basic and bland animation. <br /> <br />World Record 2/5 <br />This one really needed some extra time to explain more in-depth what is really going on.  The animation makes it seem like a moving comic book, which isn't bad. <br /> <br />Beyond 3.5/5 <br />A girl loses her cat and follows some kids into a \\"haunted house\\" where she finds her cat.  The whole thing is a glitch in the matrix, allowing these kids to fly around the house and perform amazing stunts.  In the end the agents ultimately find out about the house's discovery and correct the glitch. <br /> <br />A Detective Story 4/5 <br />Mr. Ash, a private investigator is sent to find Trinity by an un-named man over the phone.  Ash discovers that three others have been assigned on this wild goose chase and have all failed in different ways.  Featuring the voice of Carrie Ann Moss, this has probably some of the most interesting and unique animation of them all.      <br /> <br />Matriculated 4/5 <br />This is about a group of humans who are disconnected from all the conflicts involving Zion, and simply live at a small outpost \\"converting\\" machines to fight for humanity.  It starts out gloomy, but then ends up in a wild world of color and imagination where the humans do their strange ritual of convertion. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed The Matrix Trilogy, than you'll probably like Second Renaissance.  I can't really guarantee that you'll like the others, but you probably will.  Enjoy.
0060594888|5.0|In thirty-five years of studying success, I have to admit that Jack Canfield's The Success Principles may be the most engaging, cogent, readable, and complete description I've ever seen of how to create a successful and happy life.<br /><br />Not only does Jack admirably deal with the \\"how-to\\" of success, he also outlines how to deal with underlying emotional blocks that frequently keep us from taking the action we know we need to take, or keep us from enjoying whatever success we do achieve.<br /><br />The Success Principles has to be the best book on creating what you want in life since Napoleon Hill's classic Think and Grow Rich.<br /><br />As CEO of a multi-million dollar company that teaches people all over the world how to be create what they want in life, I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know about success. In spite of this, I found myself experiencing one ah-ha after another as I read this engaging and well thought-out book.<br /><br />I've had the good fortune to personally know and collaborate with Jack Canfield in various ways over the last several years. I'm continually impressed with Jack's uncanny ability to successfully teach others the secrets of success and happiness. Even more, I've admired how--in a sea of pretenders--Jack really does walk his talk and live what he teaches.<br /><br />Success is generally associated with having money, but success also includes the development of personal qualities such as peace of mind, a labor of love, a willingness to share one's blessings with others, a positive mental attitude, harmony in human relationships, freedom from fear, the capacity for faith, and a number of other similar qualities. For those who sincerely want to develop these qualities--and create financial abundance--I can think of no better teacher than Jack Canfield.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Bill Harris<br /><br />CEO, Centerpointe Research Institute
B000089CJI|4.0|I agree with everybody that this is an extremely interesting and fun album. However, if you are looking for good lyrics, do not buy this album!! Frankly, the lyrics are not their strongpoint, and in my opinion, they ruin a couple of the songs. If you are the type of person, however, that doest not mind bad lyrics, then by all means buy this album. Extremely interesting rythems, electronic sounds, and pretty cool melodies. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. Such Great Heights, Brand New Colony, and Natural Anthem are completely awesome too.
B0002XDODU|5.0|First off, let me say that I love the album. Rammstein's been my favorite band since Sehnsucht came out in the States, and although Reise, Reise is DIFFERENT, it is no less brilliant. It is, in my opinion, the most EPIC music they've ever put out. But there's nothing really I can say about it that hasn't already been said, except for two points about two of the songs: <br /> <br />Moskau: The two Russian girls singing in the background are, in fact, TATU, the band that made censors cringe in the States a while back by releasing a music video of \\"All The Things She Said\\" that featured the two girls kissing in the rain. If you're like me, and enjoy TATU's music as well, this will be a treat. <br /> <br />Ohne Dich: This is, in fact, one of Rammstein's earliest songs, (written before Herzeleid!) but was never released. The band reworked the song a bit in order to fit in more with their newer style, but apparently the lyrics are the same. I was excited to find out that this song was on the album.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|I'm a big fan of the classics, and The Adventures of Robin Hood is a fantastic movie, directed with flair by the legendary Michael Curtiz (Captain Blood). Errol Flyyn was one of the best actors of his time, and the film still holds up well today, with it's frenetic swordfights, effortless charm and brilliant actors, all combining to make a true classic and one of my all-time favorites. The DVD extras accompany the film well, with documentaries, featurettes, trailers, blooper reels and the digital restoration is perfect. A must-have for fans of the genre and for movie lovers everywhere.
0451191153|3.0|Personally, Objectivism as a philosophy is attractive on the outset because Ayn Rand gave voice to the rebellious character in all of us. But if you go beyond the obvious, we can see the problems with Objectivism.  <br /> <br />I am not suggesting an alternative philosophy to Objectivism. In fact, I admire the works of Ayn Rand as much as any other serious reader, but the problem lies in the practicality of her philosophy.  <br /> <br />I must concede that individualism appeals to me just as to most other Americans. America being the citadel of individual enterprise, needless to say, all the innovations were made possible because of the unrelenting spirit of some individual who refused to be chained down by the fetters of a utilitarian philosophy. But objectivism persuades us to goes far beyond that spirit. There lies the problem.  <br /> <br />I can understand that Ms. Rand has exaggerated the characters to bring forth her point but still that doesn't justify it. To say \\"I don't cooperate with anyone\\" presupposes the fact that every individual is right in his or her own way. So what if the President and Vice President of a company or a country were to say this? What if every individual insisted on having his or her own creative way in every endeavor of theirs? <br /> <br />I agree with Ms. Rand when she says that to feel sorry for someone is bad, because there is a subconscious and embedded malicious delight in other's misfortunes when we feel sorry for someone...kind of a good feeling that it's not happening to me. But \\"altruism\\" is not the word for it. I guess, it could be because Rand's mother tongue was not English that her choice of words were flawed. It almost gives me the impression that she was trying to say something but ended up choosing poor substitutes for the right words.  <br /> <br />But where I disagree with her is the concept of \\"second-hander.\\" What if someone did offer oneself to serve others just because he or she wanted to do it and not becauseothers wanted it? What if I loved serving others because of the innate pleasure it gives me? What if I donated my time and resources to help others in whatever small way, because I wanted to do it because of my intrinsic need to do it? You could be an altruist but still be not a \\"second-hander.\\" <br /> <br />Now, take the example of Mother Teresa. She was altruistic in the true sense of the word. I refuse to accept such people are second-handers. What if she was doing what she was doing, just for of her sole self, just because she found joy in doing it, a selfish joy? <br /> <br />Now, there is no way I can have my creative way in everything in life. What if every CEO of this world said that he wouldn't listen to anyone and would have the company run the way he wants. What if a scientist said that he would refuse to allow any modification to his innovation? What if a doctor said he would carry out a medical procedure only the way he thought was right?  <br /> <br />I wish I could extol the virtues of Rand's philosophy but whichever way you look at it, a world conceived by Ms. Rand is not possible in any walk of life. However, I don't suggest that Collectivism is the answer either. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the novel, she praises the virtues of the vanguards of capitalism. But most of the stalwarts of capitalism of the 20th century do not fit Rand's description of a creative genius. Agreed that, all of them believed in going by their instinct and designing their life in their very own way. But they had one more thing in common...they knew that even THEIR ideas might be flawed and needed cooperation by the fellow members of their species to make it work unlike Howard Roark.  <br /> <br />I would find it disgusting to live in a world where every guy raped every other girl just because \\"I\\" wanted it that way like Roark did to Dominique.  <br /> <br />As I stated before, I admire Rand as a writer but I can hardly agree to the premises of her philosophy. For a student with an academic interest in Objectivism, this is recommended. However, to adopt her philosophy as a way of life, is not a healthy choice. I give 3 stars for the quality of the literature (though, as I said, I don't agree with her philosophy). <br />
0064407667|5.0|In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. This is because not very many things happened in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children, and they were charming, and resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were extremely unlucky, and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. This book is about the three kids who find out that their parents are killed in a fire. They are left with nothing but there parents' fortune. Count Olaf claims he's their distant relative and takes them as his own. He treats them horrible and the children come to find out that he's only out for their money. The children find out what he's all about, and try to stop him, but everything seemed impossible. In the end he doesn't get their fortune but escaped from the police and the children become orphans again looking for another home. This is a fantastic fiction book to read. <br /> This was an interesting book to read. It made you wonder what was going to happen. It also explained the big words if you were clueless to what they mean, which was awesome. I definitely recommend this book because they're good and mysterious. They make you want to read it more and more. I believe kids that are interested in mystery books of the ages 9 and up would like this book. It's definitely a page turner because every second your wondering what's going to happen next. The authors style of writing was awesome because not only was it easy but when he used big words he actually told you what it meant in that specific type of situation. This book had many surprises, one was when Count Olaf stole the youngest and put her in a cage to hang from his tower until he had gotten what he'd wanted. Almost every ending of each chapter had cliff hangers. An example of one was when they left you wondering if Count Olaf's evil plan wasgoing to work out for him. I think kids of all ages would love this book I know many of my friends older and younger enjoy this book and the whole entire series. <br />
1401301010|5.0|I thought I had mixed feeling about the book. The writing is sometimes very cheesy, I hope due more to Lomas than to A.K., however the little window it opens into the 80's and 90's LA music scene is pretty cool. He's lived one of the craziest lifes I've ever heard of and, in comparison, what I used to call my wild years seem pretty stablishment now. This book has also been the trigger to a 180 degree change in my life, nothing to do with the book itself or with the author, it just opened my eyes to certain things (again no direct connection, but who cares) and now I'm finishing up a chapter of my own life and opening a totally different one, so cheers A.K. I'll be very curious to read if this has been the case for anyone else.  <br />So all in all, the book is very entertaining and easy to read, and, as for A.K. I think, good on him, he's lived the life and can still write about it, I'll have him over for tea any day.

B000002UB6|3.0|Actually the very last thing the Beatles recorded was George Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" in early 1970.  They were in the process of finishing the soundtrack album for the \\"Let It Be\\" film about a year after the original recording sessions, and decided they should add a brand new song to go with the \\"oldies\\" they'd recorded in early 1969.  They were in the process of breaking up at the time, and the lyric to this song is certainly George's comment on what was going in Beatledom in 1970! (lawyers and fighting.)  John wasn't even present the day they recorded \\"I Me Mine\\" -- it's just the other three playing. <br /> <br />It was when Paul found out that John had hired Phil Spector to overdub strings & choirs on to his songs (\\"The Long & Winding Road\\" in particular) that he decided to quit the group and that was the end of the Beatles.  Ironically, it had been Paul's idea to get \\"back to basics\\" for these sessions and NOT do any orchestral overdubbing!  (Of course Paul was the one who was most guilty of that kind of indulgent over-arrangement on past albums.) <br /> <br />One of the Beatles' most flawed records (even the two best songs here, \\"Get Back\\" & the title track, aren't as good as the original single mixes of those songs which you can get on \\"Past Masters 2\\"), but it's still THE BEATLES and there's something rewarding in even their most mediocre work.  So this is still an important chapter from their later period.
0385608136|5.0|an 18 year old uneducated waiter from bombay wins the largest ever prize-money awarded in a \\"who wants to be a billionaire?\\" quiz show. naturally, the organisers suspect foul play. did he have insider information about the questions? or did someone in the audience tip him off using signs? how could a person of such low socail standing know the answers to these difficult questions? vikas swarup's protagonist, tells his life story through each question. it just so happens that through a series of enormous coincidences, incidents in his life have provided him the answers to justthese 12 questions. as he narrates his life story question by question and answer by answer, we discover a plucky hero who has fought ahead in life through sheer courage and mental strength. <br /> <br />although, the stories start off bleak dealing with such weighty topics as pedophilia, homosexuality, incest, child abuse, the underworld .. the overall effect of the novel is sprightly and enjoyable. while this might not be for the squeamish, it is bound to provide good payoffs for those who stick by it.  <br /> <br />i was lucky to be able to lay my hands on an advance copy of this book. i am normally very skeptical of indian writers in english, but vikas swarup offers us a polished debut that showcases good storytelling skills. <br /> <br />i would recommend this novel for people interested in a ripping yarn, and not for those interested in reading about the underbelly of indian metropolis life. this is a story with liberal license used by the author, thatstretches ones believability at points, but when the plotting is as interesting as this, one can indulge the author in his fancies. <br />
1564029654|5.0|It is one of the best babybooks ever. The story is very well presented and is not boring for parents to read out to their children. The illustrations are very beautifully done.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|wow, 10 discs!! This set is definitely complete, enough to \\"reload\\" my 5 disc carousel twice, haha. Ok, I'm a matrix fan that owned all 3 movies already on DVD. I immediately sold them upon hearing news of this set. I'm very happy to hear of the new digital transfers.<br /><br />I keep hearing a lot of ppl complain about both reloaded & revolutions. I don't know why they complain at all, I thought they were great. The visual effects and music are top notch. Maybe it's just cuz I'm a fan or maybe it's because I don't over analyze it and think I could've made it better. Respect the directors and THEIR vision for how it progresses. I agree though, it does kinda suck how production companies release a movie then a year or two or three down the road offer a new better more complete version or a longer unrated directors cut, but what can you do?  There's no way to really know for sure what they someday will release to the public. That is just a sneaky little industry trick to boost their profits and unfortunately happens far too often. Anyways, to all fans of The Matrix, get this set... it's loaded!!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I love this CD, so does my husband. I like reading the one to two star reviews about certain CDs but the handful of negative reviews are not fair representation of this CD. Take my word, go out and buy this one and take a listen.

B0002ZDVEU|1.0|The story does not make sense and is nothing like Robert Ludlum's novel.  The hard to follow story is further complicated by the director's jerky and fast panning camera action that almost gives a person motion sickness.  Both the director, Paul Greengrass and the screen writer should go back to grade school or find another line of work.<br /><br />After becoming a great fan of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, both the new release with Matt Damon and the earlier one with Richard Chamberlain, The BOURNE SUPREMACY was a big disappointment.  If it were not for great acting by Matt Damon, I would have given this movie a negative one star rating.  If Matt Damon had read the script in advance of signing the contract, I am surprised that he agreed to do such a poorly writen script.  The plot had many unexplained subplots and logic gaps and jumped around almost as much as the camera did.<br /><br />Prior to seeing the Bourne Supremacy, I was in high hopes that the Bourne series would become a popular ongoing series like the James Bond series.  However, if they do not get a much better writter and director the prospect for a long running series has no hope of success.<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is physically difficult to watch and should get an award for the worst cinematography of the year (or decade).

068987474X|3.0|This book was taken out of an episode of Sex and the City, but that's not the reason why I gave it a whirl. This magazine-like book is an attempt to open the eyes of all deluded single women out there who find every excuse in the book to justify men's reasons for not calling them or for avoiding them when the simple answer all along is... you've guessed it! They are just not that into them. This book will facilitate things for us single gals, right? Wrong! We will always torture ourselves by overanalyzing things. And there are exceptions to every rule, and I am the walking proof of that. The book does discuss possible exceptions to that strong piece of advice. Some of those letters made me laugh. I marvel at the way we women analyze everything. Anyway, this was a fun, no-fuss book to read. I didn't take it seriously and neither should you. I did enjoy the bold honesty though.
B0000024YL|1.0|While the artistic quality of Simon and Garfunkel's music on this CD is not in dispute, this must rank as one of the worst re-releases on record. <br /> <br />Not only is it a re-issue of the first CD Greatest Hits collection, from the medium's mid-1980s infancy, but it's a re-issue of the original vinyl LP, from 1972. Everything identical - sleeve, tracklisting, order, running time of 44 mins 30 secs. <br /> <br />There are much better retrospectives of their work around, more comprehensive and better value despite the higher outlay. I cannot imagine why they have decided to re-issue this now, or who they're aiming it at, other than conoisseurs of blue jeans, flat caps and moustaches, perhaps.
B000000WA4|5.0|To clear any confusion that one may feel when listening to clips of songs they've heard before on this page, such as myself, the clips are switched. What you hear on the first disc really should be the same number on the opposite disc, and vice versa. (I.e., If you were to click on Bullet with Butterfly wings, you wouldn't hear that song. It'd be the OTHER number six song.) If you figured that out already, then nevermind. This is just for people who CAN but DON'T think on a regular basis, like me. Oh, and, uh, Smashing Pumpkins rock... Sure....
B000008GVG|4.0|Iron Maiden's 1980 debut full-length LP is our first glimpse at the powerhouse and ultra-successful band it would become, albeit with an almost completely new version of the band than who is present on this album. Only guitarist Dave Murray and founder bassist Steve Harris remain in the band to this day from the players on this album. And while it may not contain any major hit songs or be voiced by the legendary Bruce Dickinson, it is no less an awesome album that if you haven't heard it by now, you must indeed be living under that proverbial rock. <br /> <br />I was first introduced to this album by my friend's brother, about 4 years ago, who owns pretty much EVERY album Iron Maiden has ever released, including hard to find imports and out of print albums. Up until this point I had only been into late '80s-early '90s Iron Maiden. And at first it took me some time to get around that this was Paul Di'Anno on vocals, and he has a significantly different voice than Bruce, not only that but the approach to the songs and the entire album is far different, it has a noticeable punk edge and also serves up some tender crooning from Di'Anno (check out the verses to \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and \\"Strange World\\"), just the whole package is very raw and untamed with no real overproduction and it fits Di'Anno's rugged vocals perfectly.  <br /> <br />If you are already a fan of Iron Maiden you probably own this or are on your way to buying it, and if you're thinking of buying it then you might want to do that. IRON MADIEN gives you your first glimpse of Eddie, it's a great cover too, simple, just him standing on the empty streets in the dead of night, most likely a reference to the opening track \\"Prowler\\", awesome tune. (Eddie also has hair here, guess even zombie's can lose thier hair over the years!) and don't forget \\"Running Free\\", the original and BEST version of this song. Bruce just can't do Di'Anno's songs as well..and who could? This album may not be a classic but it's a greatdebut that most already own. You can be one too.  7/9
B0006284JQ|5.0|I just want to say that this album is REALLY good and features some really fun, energetic songs!  This song really has some HITS, and while some aren't hits, all of Britney's songs have really made quite an impact on the music world.  Having said that, I want to address some of the reviews attacking Britney.   <br /> <br />As far as I'm concerned, Britney is still THE most popular entertainer around and whether or not she is talented (in your eyes) does not change the fact that a lot of people love her.  It's obvious that Britney does not have a great voice, but the songs on her album still sound amazing.  Britney CAN write music and that is evident on her fourth album, In The Zone, where she co-wrote a 7 of the 13 tracks, including the SUPERB Touch Of My Hand and of course, the lovely Everytime.  She actually came up with the music for Everytime.  And how can you say that Britney can't dance?  She is first and foremost an amazing dancer and performer.  How is she atrocious?  Her concerts consistently sell very well and her Onyx Hotel Tour sold WAY better than the combined likes of Beyonce, Alicia Keys, and Missy Elliot.  And how is she \\"stealing\\" stage sets?  Can people no longer dance using the same sets and props?  Britney has had some VERY unique settings.  Again, this is supposed to be a review for her ALBUM not her life?  Why are you bringing up Britney's \\"contradictions\\" when people buy the album to listen to Britney's music, not to hear her life story.  And people CAN make comebacks after having children or taking a break!  Anyone remember Shania?  She came back and had stellar first week sales for Up!  I doubt many of the \\"legendary\\" bands couldn't even make a comeback to the degree that Shania did.  And how is the public tired of her?  Whether or not she's looking like hell, she's still the one being followed around 24/7!  The media thrives on ANY news about Britney even though she wants to be out of the spotlight.  There's pics of her everywhere she goes,for goodness sake!  And why the heck would you compare Pink Floyd, a band that's been out for over 30, almost 40 years to a girl that's been out for 6 tears?  And it's personal preference for people to decide what's solid gold and what's foil!  Who's to say one cannot like Britney more than Madonna?  And as for Echoes selling better than GH:MP, ummmm....they've been building up hits for 30-40 years and hadn't released a studio album in quite a while.  I'm not saying Pink Floyd and Madonna aren't legends or anything (because they ARE and rightly so), but it's very unfair to be saying their more \\"legendary\\" than Britney.  And if Madonna can compare herself to Britney and praise her for being a great artist, why can't others?  As far as I'm concerned, I think Britney is the closest thing to Madonna that's come along in a LONG while.  That is my opinion and if you disagree, then fine.  Just don't say that it's WRONG to think so.   <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|1.0|*stabs Avril voodoo doll several times with kitchen knife* <br /> <br />Now THAT'S fun. <br /> <br />This is a pop album, not rock. Deluded fans take note! I would call it humorous but it just annoys me. Can't sing, her voice is whingy and beyond tuneful. The main reason im going to this fuss to write a review though is because I have seen her in interviews and she comes across as rude, stuck up and generally vile in every possibly way. Has NOBODY noticed this? <br /> <br />The songs are horrid and cringeful. Who would call a song sk8er boi with serious face? The lack of dignity is shocking. <br /> <br />Though I must praise Avril for starting the craze of long straight hair and tomboy clothing for teenage girls, it means I can wear my fairy clothes without embarassment. I love my fairy clothes. <br /> <br />A girl living opposite my house loves this album, or her other album I dont know. Whatever. She plays it loud sometimes. Pity me please.
B000002BSG|5.0|Jamiroquai's best album ever. Everything before was a little too loose and a bit jazzy. Everything afterwards is a little too commercial-funk for the masses. Travelling hits the perfect balance. <br />Great bass licks and some superb drumming (Derrik Mackenzie is one hot drummer) mould perfectly with Jay's voice to create some of the bands best tunes. <br />Highlights include Use the force, High Times, Alright and Travelling without moving which starts with an accelerating Diablo. A very cool song to drive to, puts me into a racing mood everytime. <br /> <br />This album is a must for any cd collection and a highlight from the 1990's. If you want to get into Jamiroquai, start with this album! <br /> <br />
B00005JN0T|4.0|A very pleasant surprise, I Robot, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: Robots-and lots of them! <br />But that is not the only thing that there is plenty of; it combines action, adventure and comedy, making this movie definitely worth watching. <br />Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, though Will Smith does overdo it with his character's \\"attitude problem\\"/ \\"Chip on his shoulder\\"etc; it gets tiring after a while, not to mention unrealistic (e.g. being sarcastic and giving the billionaire owner of the robot company a \\"hard time\\").   <br />Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, and the special effects are all wonderful, not to mention the ending, which is great.   <br />Therefore, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel! <br />

B0002DKCMG|4.0|Definitely a good movie, Eurotrip, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of four kids just out of high school who end up travelling to Europe in an effort to reach one of the guy's girlfriend so that he can let her know that he loves her.  Along the way, they get into all sorts of trouble resulting in one of the best comedies in recent years! <br />To a certain extent it does bring to mind Chevy Chase's European Vacation, but it falls way short of reaching the level of that classic. <br />In addition, the unrated version is without doubt STRONGLY recommended as the ladies are truly AMAZING (with the exception of Michelle Trachtenberg, playing the leading female character).  <br />On the negative side, the main actors are rather mediocre to say the least, though they do seem to have put into the movie the maximum of what they are capable of.  The cast from Road Trip or American Pie would have been PERFECT as the film is indeed very well written and very well presented.  Eurotrip is simple enough, nevertheless, it is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.   <br />Recommended along with Road Trip, Old School, the Girl Next Door and of course (!!!) the American Pie trilogy.   <br />
0385508417|1.0|This story starts out hokey, remains hokey and ends hokey.  In our modern world, neighbors don't even know each other's names, let alone care about whether or not they decorate their houses for Christmas or decide to take a trip to the islands.  I know this book was intended to be fun, but it never even made me smile.  I just thought it was stupid and a waste of time.  From the reviews of the movie that just came out based on this book \\"Christmas with the Kranks,\\" the movie is just as bad as the book.
B000002H70|4.0|In my opinion this is the best Cure album.  The writing, music and production are all fantastic and it all seems to come together seamlessly.  Most of all, this album has loads of passion and desire so it comes across as very genuine to the listener.  It's almost always in my cd player and never seems to get boring. There are no real low points but for me, Pictures of you has to be one the greatest songs of all time.  The extended version on the album is soooo much better than the radio mix it's almost a completely different song.     To sum it up, it's a great listen for Cure and non Cure fans alike.

I give the film five stars. <br /> <br />However, I give these cheap prints of the film one star, and so my score of three is a reminder to potential buyers that you get what you pay for.  I have one of the cheap $6 DVDs of this film, and will not make this mistake again.  The transfer on these cheap versions is simply terrible.  Invest in the more expensive version if you want to purchase this; the cheap ones are murky and somewhat trying to watch.  Since a major part of this film is the innovative interplay of light and shadow used to create the mood, a crisp transfer (as much can be expected from such an old film) is paramount.  What else is paramount is being able to see what's going on and which character is which, issues that aren't always easy with the cheap versions.  Spend the extra $10, buy the good version, and save yourself the frustration of trying to figure out what's going on in almost every scene.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|The fantastic Ray Charles sounds frail, even accompanied by the great orchestrations, in this dynamic set of duets but it won't hamper your enjoyment of this wonderful CD.  It's all the more poignant since it was released posthumously, garnering him 7 Grammy nominations, too.<br /><br />It is a strange collection of song choices and match ups, seemingly drawn out of a hat.  Johnny Mathis and OVER THE RAINBOW?  Willie Nelson and WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN?  Even so, Charles is the champion of soulful song, and this belongs in every music lover's library.
B0006399FS|1.0|Let's not mince words - there hasn't been a good U2 album in years, and it appears there never will be again after this lame release.
B00063EMJ6|2.0|I am a longgggg time fan of Neil Youngs, back to the days before he didn't write Horse With No Name. But this collection is sooo uninteresting. Each song has it's merits, (despite the fact I personally hate Southern Man and Ohio). But Mr. Young's music is about feelings and attitude and revolution and this set is so predictable and contrived. Buy the original album collections or wait until a box set does justice to the depth of his work. (Or buy Decade if you need just some of these songs, (for your iPod?).) This is too much like what the first Jackson Browne greatest hits collection was, quick money for non-fans.
B000002KHH|4.0|Great album with many of black sabbaths greatest songs. The music on here is very catchy and addicting. This is a cd that everyone should own metal fan or not. The only song I don't realy listen to that much is \\"iron man\\" because I hear it so god dam much that it is starting to piss me off! It is still a good song though,but the other tracks are better. A LANDMARK IN METAL! GET IT NOW!  JESUS AS$ RAPING CHRIST NOW I HAVE THAT IRON MAN SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD!  ALSO RECOMENDED:MASTERS OF REALITY,BLACK SABBATH,AND SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH
0312305060|4.0|Michael Cunningham has written a beautiful modern version of Virginia Woolf's classic \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" managing to capture the complexities of the original and add a few of his own. <br /> <br />Clarissa Vaughn begins her day searching for flowers for a party she will throw to celebrate an award her writer friend, Richard, has won. It is Richard who compares Clarissa to the famous literary character \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" As Clarissa goes about her day we are taken back in time to meet Virginia Woolf as she begins to write her classic story. And as we read Virginia's beginning words another of Cunningham's characters, Mrs. Brown, picks up the book to read....\\"Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.\\" Cunningham weaves the story of three women into one, all suffer from melancholy, and all struggle with an aspect of her day as they each deal with their own hours in circumstantial and age related ways. Mrs. Brown fails at baking a cake, Clarissa fails as a friend, and Virginia wonders how she failed in life but all the while lurks \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" going about her day hoping to extinguish her own emptiness.  <br /> <br />Cunningham has managed something quite extraordinary with his re-written modern version of \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" In his version the famous character is free to experience her true heart with the freedoms that modern society has provided. Clarissa and Sally have carried their infatuation from the original story into a committed lesbian relationship here. Richard, a tortured and reluctant soul, finds himself a character confronting AIDS and pondering the direction of his life while still seemingly obsessed with Clarissa. Clarissa's daughter is again pursued for her youth and vitality by both old and angry lesbians seeking her energy. The party begins the day but in Cunningham's novel the ending arrives quite differently. Cunningham writes beautifully and captures a whisper of Woolf as he goes along to reveal how \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" may have went about herday had she experienced this age. Cunningham guides us between his three stories always sure to connect them in some seemingly insignificant way that is actually hauntingly real. <br /> <br />While I fully believe Cunningham's work here can stand on its own I also believe it is enhanced with a familiarity to Virginia Woolf's original story. As a reader I did not grasp all of the intricacies of Cunningham's novel until I had read Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" and then re-read Cunningham, only then was I able to understand just where Cunningham's ideas stemmed from and fully marveled at his talent. But no matter how you read between the lines this novel is well worth the hours spent within its pages. <br />
0385335482|4.0|This book sure will not become a classic or even be remembered by most people 20 years from now...as is going to be the fate of many Bridget Jones rip-offs. <br />That aside however, this is a fun read and a perfect escapist novel...even if it is a bit predictable. The characters are very well developed, which is one thing that I probably most appreciate in a book. Becky is an interesting character. I found myself empathizing with some of her problems, but at the same time appalled by her overdelveloped shallowness and irresponsibility. I guess that's what makes the scrapes she gets into so enjoyable...you know she deserves it. She's like the spoiled rich popular girl in highschool/college that you just wanted to slap and scream \\"Real life is not so easy!\\"  <br />It is also a bit unbelievable how much she got away with. She goes 6 months without paying her bills before they shut off her credit cards. Maybe they work differently in the UK, but I know in the US, if I go ONE WEEK over my due date, I can just forget about using that card...not that that ever happens to me *cough cough* :) <br />And wouldn't it be nice if creditors actually believed our pitiful excuses and wrote us personal letters sending their sympathies about our broken legs/dead aunts/etc. <br /> <br />Yeah, some of it may be a bit ludacris but there were parts where I laughed outloud. I read it very quickly because I wanted to see what trouble she was going to get into next.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's not Keats, but who wants Keats every day? A fun quick read that will make you laugh. And I hear that laughter adds time onto your life.  <br />Read this book and live longer.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Stephen Sommers has quickly proven himself to be a hack director with zero talent and zero respect for his subject matter, or his audience for that matter. I cannot recall a film as bad and as offensive as this since the last Star Wars film. I'm a huge horror and fantasy film fan, but this movie had nothing. Once again, as has become the norm for films in this genre today, an over dependance on CGI effects in lieu of a good script. Nothing like human beings bouncing off stone walls like rubber balls or flying through the air to sustain belief. Hugh Jackman must have been high on goofballs when he read this script. 2 hours of uninspired, unemotional dreck. A true insult to the films it supposedly pays tribute to, and proof positive that $148 million, cheezy computer effects, or wooden acting does not guarantee entertainment.  <br /> <br />Somebody put Sommers down like a wounded horse, please!
B00005JMUL|5.0|I totally loved this movie!!! I don't understand why people say they found it boring and useless!!! It's such a great movie and so perfect for christmas! It's about believing in the spirit of christmas and never losing your childish image of santa claus.  <br /> <br />Yeah, all of us don't believe in santa anymore. But after watching this flick, you guys are totally gonna expect santa to come down your chimney on Christmas eve. :) This movie is filled with touching scenes and little christmas miracles we never even believed possible. And the special effects were totally awesome! The scenes were so beautiful and the colors were all so vibrant and lively :)  <br /> <br />This is a story about a boy who has doubts about believing in Santa Claus but then on Christmas Eve, the polar express suddenly stopped over his house and invited him to go on the journey to the Polar Express. As the journey continues, he makes new friends, witnesses little Christmas miracles, realizes important lessons and little by little, he starts to believe. <br /> <br />The main message of the movie is that the Christmas spirit really lies inside those who truly believe. Those who truly want Christmas to be beautiful no matter what. Like what the train director once said in the movie, \\"Seeing may be believing. But sometimes, the most real things in this world are the things we cannot see.\\" It goes something like that. So as long as the true spirit of christmas lies in your heart, you'll always find a way to believe.  <br /> <br />\\"The thing about trains... It doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is deciding to get on.\\" -The Polar Express  <br /> <br />If the Polar Express stops over your house one day, would you decide to get on? :) See this movie and find out.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I, like many others, was excited to know that this footage was going to be released, especially since all prior information stated that this stuff would NEVER be released or seen again. <br />Sound and video quality are good, typical for a mid '80s live event.  <br />My personal highlight is the clip of Sade performing \\"Your Love Is King\\". Early footage of this band is hard to come by, I just wish their other performances were available as well. <br />Hard to believe it's been nearly 20 years! <br />Enjoy!
B000660UN0|5.0|I chase all albums of Clapton, especially starting with Mayall and Cream. Jack Bruce of Cream is my superstar and Clapton was a \\"star\\" that needed pop hits to survive. His LPs in 80s are a crap and LP Pilgrim is just a suicide. When Clapton starts playing blues, real blues, he becomes himself again, real guitar player with the real message. This cd/dvd is in my opinion his \\"excuse me for what I did before to make money and let me tell you something real...\\" I got the message and I do love hime again. This cd/dvd is his number 1 so far in his solo carrier. Even if he is going to make more cash.
0316666343|5.0|Why polarizing? I have found that people tend to love or despise this book. I find myself much more on the \\"love\\" side of the fence, if for no other reason than for the daring, unique viewpoint of the main character. She is dead, and is in heaven, describing things as she sees them on earth as well as describing her death. It was somewhat like passing a car wreck on the highway-- you stare, both compelled to look and repelled by what you see.<br /><br />This book is bound to be a classic, and I think it deserves that fate. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it has weak spots, especially toward the end, but who said books have to be perfect?
B00005JM02|4.0|This animated pixar film has been the best Disney movie in years. Full of humor and sadness a clownfish named Marlin goes looking for his stolen son Nemo. With vegetarion sharks, a deep sea fish that has a glowing light on an attena, and a nightmare named Darla. This is movie is a kid favorite.
B00008977N|5.0|If you are a \\"purist\\" who does not wish to listen to a concert DVD with any studio overdubbing, then you should not buy this.  If you want to have a wonderful time watching an excellent \\"performance\\" (which I do almost once a week)then this is among the best concert DVD's you could buy.  Yes, the vocals are overdubbed, and yes it certainly appears as if Tony Levin is playing a bass with frets, but sounds like most of the recording is done on a fretless.  However, if you can \\"forgive\\" these anomalies you will experience an extraordinary concert DVD.  The bass work of Levin is alone worth the price of admission, the drumming is excellent, and the energy is overwhelming.  My girlfriend, my kids, her kids, are no particular fans of Gabriel but everyone likes this DVD.  $15 couldn't be better spent.
B000006TRV|5.0|People always say DSOTM is the best Floyd record. I know what they're on about, but I disagree. The Wall, like DSOTM, perfectly captures the state of mind of the band at the time. Where in 1972 they were dreaming of stardom and musing about the state of mankind and whether or not humans could be humane, The Wall finds them paranoid, burnt out by fame and tortured by childhood demons (admittedly, mostly those of Roger Waters). In that sense, I think the albums are equal. I also think they're peers in creating and sustaining a mood and in developing themes that they revisit throughout the piece, something Floyd was expert at.  <br /> <br />What tips the scales in favor of The Wall, for me, is the utter madness and despair explored over the course of 80 minutes. It's cinematic in scope, meticulous in arrangement and absolutely compelling in execution. To this day I can listen to the whole record front to back and be drawn in. Earlier reviewers talk about how there's no jamming, and Rick Wright's role is minimal, but I love the fact that Roger Waters had by this point completed usurped control of the band, awful though it must have been for the other members. His paranoia is manifest in the concept of the album, and his control over the project permeates the tone and performances. I only recently marveled at how exact the drums are - it sounds completely orchestrated.  <br /> <br />And what about David Gilmour? My god, there's no better showcase for this genius than this record. Acoustic, electric, arpeggiated chords, solos, tone of the gods - it's all here. Gilmour's never been better than on this album, and although I'm still pissed that they carried on without Waters and, to my mind, became a pale shadow of their former selves, I can't dispute the fact that he rules on The Wall. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the jammy, dreamlike Floyd stuff, DSOTM, Obscured by Clouds or Meddle would be better albums to get. But for a bleak, dystopian worldview spread out over two discs and 80 minutes, The Wall is it, baby.
B0002UM1E6|5.0|Lady & The Tramp was my favorite movie as a child, and it continues to be one of my favorites as an adult. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. As a mother of six young children I highly recomend it.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Other than the end, where I felt this movie got a little weak, it was an enjoyable movie, and I feel like watching it again (something I can hardly ever say). <br /> <br />Cruise plays a heartless hitman, and does a believable job at it. Just as I was thinking \\"There is something wrong with this guy - his upbringing must have been crap or some genetic psychological problem.\\" Max, the cab driver, pointed out pretty much the same thing. <br /> <br />Anyway, I found the movie quite enjoyable. It's a simple plot, so one should know that going in, but it kept my attention better than most.
B00030590I|5.0|I was mesmerized through the entire film. It is one of the most beautifully filmed, scripted and acted piece of artwork I have ever seen.<br /><br />It is different and predictably not everyone liked it but I thought that it was brilliant.<br /><br />Jet Li stars as the Namesless Hero who in service to his King killed the three assasins: Sky, Flying Snow and Master Broken Sword, who had been attempted to kill the King of Qin; revenge for his soldiers killing their families in the Kings quest to unify the seven warring states of ancient China.<br /><br />This is a typical Chinese legend told in beautiful Chinese style. I have loved the old Chinese legends from my experience with the martial arts and felt very \\"connected\\" to the characters.<br /><br />It is timeless epic of love, honor, duty, sacrifice, loyalty and revenge told with the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. Better even in that regard the the Last Samurai ( another brilliant piece of art)<br /><br />The movie is essentially a series of re-tellings of events surrounding Namesless' quest to kill the assaisins, Nameless telling his version of the killing of the assasins for the kings benefit. The king being paranoid about the attempts on his life requires Nameless to initially drink and speak from 100 paces. As the story is told the king permits Nameless to advance closer and closer.<br /><br />Probably due to my familiarity with Chinese legends I knew what was coming, but others who watched it with me never guessed until it was tacitly revealed by the King and Nameless.<br /><br />The directing, acting fight choreography and script were beautiful beyond my abilty to describe. There is more than one version of events told and as each is revealed the whole truth finally comes out.<br /><br />It is not necessary to agree or disagree with the \\"message\\" that unification of the warring states but the end result is based on historical fact of the beginning of the unification and China's first Dynasty.<br /><br />This movie gave me goosebumps.<br /><br />Buy this movie and enjoy it over and over.<br /><br />Watch it in Madarin once without the subtitles. It is a spiritual experience in its native language. The subtitles distract you fomr seeing all the fine nuances of the actors faces and motions as well as the extraordinary scenery.<br /><br />One note about the wire stunts. These stunts are popular in Chinese films and do add a ballet-like flair to the sword fighting scenes. Many in the US seem to be down on the \\"flying\\" of the fighters saying it is over the top and makes the scenes look silly.<br /><br />I come here to defend the flying on several counts. First, who are we to say that it is impossible? Because we can't do it or understand it? If that is the standard then the \\"impossible\\" is done every day of our lives. How many things that we have always said was impossible turn out to be very possible and maybe even simple? Think about that.<br /><br />Also - if anyone is familar with the ancient \\"kungs\\" they are themselves almost unbelievable yet many of the masters have demonstrated accomplishment in these kungs that defy modern scientific explanation. Jumping, iron broom, basket and red sand kungs are still being performed today in parts of China and can be witnessed.<br /><br />China has a long history of learning and knowledge. The Chinese were making wine in 7,000 BC! The Chinese had thousands of years to practice and study and perfect these kungs. In some cases there were a hundred generations of masters who practiced a single kung their entire lives and did nothing but that! You don't do anything for that long unless you have results.<br /><br />Think of acupuncture as one example. Previously dismissed as \\"voodoo\\" by western medicine yet the Chinese have been practicing it for 4000 years! Who would do something for 4000 years if it didn't work? Now acupuncture is done is frequently western medicine. They still can't explain it but they have to admit that it works.<br /><br />I think it is very presumnptuos to think that we educated and \\"modern\\" westerners know it all and can so easily pronounce things as being impossible, especially things from such an ancient civilization. The Chinese were writing, learning and exploring their world ( and space ) when we Eurpoeans were still living in trees and hitting each other with clubs. Folks, we don't know it all.<br /><br />I have seen myself red sand kung, jumping and wall climbing kungs. I have seen a master of basket kung walk along the edge of a wicker basket so soft and light I could move it with a breath yet I saw master balance and run along the edge without distorting the weave. There was no trick.I saw with my own eyes the red sand kung and it was not a trick.<br /><br />Simple jumping like these scenes depicted. I can give it the benefit of the doubt. Not only that they lend a beauty to the scenes that is stunning in its impact.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece. Buy it and enjoy it.xplain it but they have to admit that it works. <br /> <br />I think it is very presumnptuos to think that we educated and \\"modern\\" westerners know it all and can so easily pronounce things as being impossible, especially things from such an ancient civilization.

B00005JMAH|3.0|Unlike most of the reviewers I don't think this is the best of the three.  In fact I think the other two were way better.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately I don't think the new Dumbledore has as great of a presence like Richard Harris.  Maybe they should have looked towards Ian McKellen, although it is sad that they had to find the replacement in the first place. <br /> <br />The movie was ok but I felt like a lot of the core content from the book was left out leaving me feeling a little empty.  A good example is they never really explained the relationship between the rat, the teacher and Sirius. <br /> <br />
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|I moved my TV onto my deck that day so I could better my tan for a date that night. I had a garden hose next to me to cool me down when it got too hot.  I recorded every minute of the concert on VHS that day and still have it. It's not HD quality but it's sure fun to watch in it's entirety. I couldn't dream of releasing this concert on DVD without all the bands that played that day. Man, it was history in so many respects. It was a happening. When Led Zepplin came out with Phil Collins on drums, I thought I had died and gone to rock heaven. How can a band not allow its footage to be included in this DVD? It just kills the spirit of the whole concert. IT\\"S ABOUT GIVING STUPID!!!!!!
B00005JMXX|3.0|My wife and I watched this movie two nights ago. While \\"so wrong on so many levels\\" was how she described it, we thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a movie that was made to be seen at home so that you can laugh and snicker at all of the appropriate times.  That said, it's a hoot!  If you want a serious or just semi-believable movie about the consequences of global warming, this isn't the one.  If you merely want two hours of fairly absurd unintentional comedy, this works.
014118213X|5.0|A surprisingly entertaining book. It is simply and elegantly written, and easy to understand and appreciate. There are also more issues than I can begin to discuss simmering beneath the surface. However, one way to read it is a chronicle of the changing culture of England in the early 20th century. It's much more interesting than you heard. I generally don't like recommending books to everyone, but if you are considering this book of your own free will (I assume so since you are reading this review), you will enjoy it.
B0000033OZ|5.0|Sure, Lake's 'Lucky Man' was the single - - too bad they couldn't get away with such a thing today.  And not only does Emerson outdo anything he ever did with The Nice in 'Take A Pebble' ('Hang On To A Dream' notwithstanding), he also outdoes almost everything he did subsequently with ELP in terms of piano-playing alone, and in theory the song wasn't even his.  'Knife Edge' is perfectly and darkly menacing and desperate; 'The Barbarian' sounds like a troglodyte's ballet - - simply awesome- - and in 'Tank' Carl Palmer showcases his chops as he never did with Atomic Rooster.  I won't even go into 'The Three Fates'; it's unimpeachable.  What an album.
1591840562|5.0|I've been involved with many more than 250 start-ups as an employee, service provider and coach. Remember the U.S. Robotics 2400 Courier modem? Launching it was my first deal as employee #72 at my first venture, USR. Most of the lessons I learned were from the College of Hard Knocks. They came at significant personal expense: money + time. The money is easy to replace. The time... well, that's irreplaceable.  <br /> <br />Guy's book, The Art of the Start, sums up many important elements. Two of my favorites: 1)Pg 85: Start as a Service Business to generate immediate cash flow AND to gain personal experience with the product you've built. How novel, a supplier who actually uses their own product; 2) Pg 89: Go Direct and bypass the [idiotic] thinking that selling through some distribution channel is going to build revenue faster. False hope. No way to develop customer intimacy! <br /> <br />If you are thinking about starting a business or if you are already well on your way, you need to read this book. It will save you money. Period.  <br /> <br />John M. Fox, Venture Marketing
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|What can I say: I'm obsessed with The Gilmore Girls. I simply can't get enough. Too bad Stars Hollow is fictional; otherwise I'd probably move there next week (and try to steal Luke away from Lorelai....but I digress). Simply put: this is good, quality TV. It is unique and fresh. And that's because it's got great writing and great casting/acting and that's something that is hard to find these days. And by the way it's about time those Emmy/Golden Globe people give Lauren Graham her much overdue awards -- there are comedic actresses...and then there is Lauren. She's phenomenal.<br /><br />This second season has some fun bonus features and my personal fave is the guide to Gilmore-isms handbook to help the less-informed decipher those quick asides they regulary toss the viewers' way. Half of the challenge is to catch them since the dialog moves so fast, but even the most informed person will be stumped time to time since the \\"isms\\" are so random/diverse.<br /><br />This DVD set is worth the small investment because I guarantee you will watch it time and time again, just like the first season. And speaking of seasons...when is season three making its appearance? I'm greedy for more!
0553275976|5.0|I was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film, but, finally decided to give it a go (despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover...) This book is an example of what a meticulous, fearless and talented writer of prose can come up with in response to the world around him. While being a great 'page-turner' as far as plot goes, Wolfe manages, through a complex web of ironies and double ironies, to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place. He deals so breath-takingly honestly with his characters that many readers might blanche, and want to point fingers at the author, something Wolfe is couragous enough to bear, obviously. He does not set himself up as a prophet - like many modern 'social-awareness' authors - and I am sure does not absolve himself from many of the 'vanities' that are examined in this book. He tries to be honest, deal honestly with his characters and, thus, his readers, which is perhaps so strange in this literary day and age that it is considered reactionary. It is not. It is a novelist. I will certainly be reading more Wolfe, who has now become my favourite living American author.
0802130208|2.0|I read bits and pieces of this book and what i read wasnt good. The people in the book are weird with strange ideas. Whats up with furtuna? Who is that ? Jones is full of himself and doesn't care about society. He tries to get on a woman on the bus. santa is a ols woman who tries to be young. it wasn't my type of book.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|A few years ago, I remember hearing Johnny Cash on TV singing and playing the song \\"Hurt\\" all by himself on an acustic guitar, a song that I'd never heard before but which they said in introducing Mr. Cash was a Nine Inch Nails song.  Prior to that one moment, I was of the opinion that country music was absolute garbage and that only insane, tone deaf people could possibly stand to listen to it (my parents were a shining example of that).  With that one song, Johnny Cash made me reevaluate! <br /> <br />Incidentally, I still think that the vast majority of country music is absolute garbage and that only insane, tone deaf people could possibly stand to listen to it, but I know that there are some real jewels there as well, as much as I hate to admit it.  Cash's cover of \\"Hurt\\" actually made me tear up, it was so heart-felt and, well amazing! <br /> <br />Well, I figured that, if that one song was so amazing, I should check out a few albums.  Of course this is one of the ones, since it had that song!  I was *so* looking forward to hearing it again! <br /> <br />And, OH GOD WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  What insane, tone deaf chimpanzee mixed this album?!?  I mean, how can you possibly justify playing piano over the song \\"Hurt\\" so that it becomes basically impossible to hear Cash's voice in some places?!?  Grrrrrrrr...  And, the accompanying vocals on some of the songs...  What in the world made them think that was a good idea? <br /> <br />*sigh*  I write this review in the hopes that this album *was* actually mixed, or that, somewhere, there exist pure Cash versions of the great songs on this album, and that someone reads it and understands that Cash diserves more then the harsh treatment this album has given his memory. <br /> <br />Despite my disappointment at how this album was produced, I have to say that, where the studio didn't screw things up, Cash sounds unbelievable!  Some of the songs just made me cry, and that's a pretty big deal for me, especially where \\"country music\\" is concerned.
B00004XONN|5.0|I just wanted to make a few comments, this is almost my favorite radiohead album, of course OK Computer is my favorite, but they are essentailly all my favorite one because it seems like they are a differnt band each time. Well I read a review saying that the downfall is that there are no singles, and here is my advice, if a single is what you are looking for you probably shouldn't pick this up, because it isn't about a single, it isn't about air play at all, this needs to be taken as a whole, as does ok, but once that is realized and accepted, nothing will compare to what comes out of your cd player.
B000148KK2|5.0|I can not understand people who complain of quite a different approach of Diana Krall on this CD. Why should she only take old songs and sing and play them? Sure, she gives new life to all the standards and i like most of the songs she did mor ethan the originals for her exquisite voice and her own style. Yet this new album with her own music and texts based on her own thoughts and life makes listening more personal, more intimate...  <br /> <br />Anyway, this CD still is  a jazz cd. It may be more open to the mainstream listener, but thats a good thing. Good jazz should not be available only to a small group of elitist listeners. DK can open the doors for many people. <br /> <br />The sound of the CD is well rounded, it can not beat live performance which will always have more energy and rawness into it, but its great to listen to with your girlfriend prefferably in front of a burning fireplace <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|So here it is - fully four years after ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND, U2 returns to the shelves (and, presumably, the charts) with HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB. That's quite a mouthful of title from a band long known for applying single-word, sometimes monosyllabic labels to much of its catalogue; but the real question, of course, is whether the music matches the moniker.     Alas, in the case of BOMB (a title I'd actually prefer), the answer is no.     It hurts to say this, folks, after two decades and more as an avowed fan of U2's music, but the fact is there's simply nothing (well, almost nothing) here: no subjects, no ideas, no observations and precious little art or energy. For the first time in its career, this band seems content to rest on its laurels with an album which, no matter how you slice it, really is U2 in name only. And if the \\"bomb\\" in question is the astonishing quarter-century of music which preceded it, then perhaps the title is in fact a very deliberate joke, for never has U2 sounded more dismantled.     \\"Vertigo,\\" BOMB's opener, initial single and currently the Jingle of the Month thanks to a silly iPod commercial, is a fairly strong song. It rocks appealingly, with a punky guitar line from the Edge and a chorus memorable enough to drive you nuts for some time after you've heard it. The nightclubber's reverie of the lyrics may seem slight, but it's the closest thing to a genuine story - or a genuine personality - BOMB has to offer.     From there, however, it's really just one long mumble, as a man who once enunciated emotions and commented on headlines with turns of phrase that could've left Bob Dylan weeping with envy tosses off the sort of prosaic patter you'd expect to overhear on a bus. The absurd rhyming of \\"tortoise\\" with \\"choice\\" is about the wittiest moment here; for the rest, well, let's just say I'm far more appalled at the status of Bono's insight than I am at the status of his voice.     Part - but only part - of the problem with this album is its overt effort to sequel ATYCLB. From the grainy, black-and-white band photos adorning the booklet to the unimaginative song titles (several of which are almost identical to those of their counterparts on the previous album) to the generally staid ambience of the whole mishmosh, BOMB is U2's first-ever attempt to cash in on an earlier release without improving on it in any way. Remarkably, the group seems to have misread its own success. What made ATYCLB work so well was precisely the fact that no one expected such a market-friendly, traditional pop album (let alone such a good one) from a band long since written off - or embraced - as unrepentant, Enoized experimentalists. With BOMB, however, we not only get the expected; we get less of it.      From \\"Miracle Drug\\" - an ironic title indeed on an album so desperately in need of one - through \\"All Because of You,\\" I can only agree with the earlier reviewer who claimed an inability to tell where one song ended and another began. Even Adam Clayton's nice bluesy bass walk on \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" can't keep the listener alert - the sad truth is, no one instrument is going to save the day, and only material this weak could make you wish for such a thing.     While many U2 albums start to deflate in their latter halves, this is actually where BOMB burns up what little juice it has left. \\"A Man and a Woman\\" pricks the ears up a bit, if only because the Edge has switched to an acoustic guitar for it; and \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" would be a genuinely good song had Bono troubled himself to do more with it than simply reiterate the same calcified moan of abstract dissatisfaction he'd already employed on every other track save the opener. After that, however, it's right back to nowhere, the mildly intriguing arrangement of the first part of \\"Original of the Species\\" providing the only bump along the way.     Had \\"Vertigo\\" been used as a blueprint for even some of the forty-six minutes that follow it,BOMB might have a fuse. As it stands, however, the song appears to serve as a teaser - a lone moment of inspiration blown up into an album for lack of anything better to record. I'll admit that my third listen (with headphones) revealed a few engaging moments; but by moments I mean just that - a tasteful bit of drumming from Larry Mullen here, an unforeseen chord change there, and so forth. As far as whole songs are concerned, only \\"Vertigo\\" and possibly \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" make the grade, and it's hardly an A+. As noted before, I've been a U2 fan for a long time, and I truly believe I could not only accept but thoroughly enjoy anything the band chose to release, provided it bore the stamp of its personality. BOMB, to these ears at least, does not. It merely sounds like a group of songs made by a group of musicians to fulfill the terms of a contract and so satisfy a group of executives. So while I'm heartwarmed and glad to see so many people writing nice things about this album, in the end I must respectfully disagree.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have had this collection for a very long time now and yet I continue to watch each episode over and over again. These episodes - for whatever reason - have great \\"re-watchability\\". 12 episodes! Gahaad! I don't know why they made only 12 of these gems, but there ain't nothin' I can do about it, I guess. This collection is superb! The only complaint I have is that the \\"case\\" that houses these 3 disks is ungainly and one is forced to lay the thing down flat to unfold it fully. Also dust and dirt can get in from the top and bottom when fully closed. I would have preferred 3 independent fully-protective cases.<br /><br />Update August 19, 2005:<br /><br />I just purchased another one of these sets for my mother and she absolutely loves it!
B0002O7XWC|5.0|If you already have the 30th anniversary edition don't buy this one. It's a rip off !! it's the same exact thing that the previous version same menu and same extras. You get a cd SONGtrack not SOUNDtrack so you don't have all the movie's songs and the short book by Lee.<BR>So if you don't have a dvd version of Easy Rider go for it you won't regret it and if you already have the 30th version then wait till the 40 th maybe we will have the three full hours uncut or at list part of it.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I loved this movie.  When I first saw the title I thought \\"not another Peter Pan movie, please\\".  Well it's not just a Peter Pan movie - it's the creation of the Peter Pan story.  Very well written, very well acted.  There are places for laughter and places for tears.  Johnny Depp plays the part of a wonderfully warm, common sensical dreamer.  All four boys are good in their parts, but the one that Peter is fashioned after (besides Johnny Depp) is particularly terrific.  Definitely one I will add to my DVD collection.
0385513755|3.0|Da VInci Code was a good quick read for a fast paced thriller.  As far as \\"facts\\" go, not too many.  Brown was grasping for straws when he opened the book with several \\"facts\\".  The statements are not facts and are really nothing more than fuel for conspiracy theories, which for the most part have been disproved by scholars.  But for a novel, a good read.
B0002S947K|5.0|This guy makes everything else we've ever listened to before sound like amateur hour. Where does one learn this? Makes me want to cry and make love and hold someone close. Thank you to the local radio station for playing this and opening my ears. You won't EVER be sorry to have this in your CD collection. And you'll sound hella cool for turning your friends on to him before it gets trendy.
0316666343|3.0|I'm still trying to figure out if I liked the book or not.    Some parts were exceptionally well developed, like the family dianamics after Suzie's death, the reaction each individual person had to the tragedy and, finally, what brought closure to her death.  What left me wanting was the description of heaven.  I felt that the way Alice Sebold described it was uninviting and, more than anything else, a place that offered all sorts of pampering of the physical body (but, of course, Suzie was dead, so she didn't have a physical body), but no comfort for the soul, thus, it made it seem a lonely, cold place to which I would not like to go to when I leave this world.  The book starts quite well and evolves into a good story.  As I said, the characters are well developed and the plot grips the reader.  3/4 into it, however, it loses momentum and it makes you feel like the author really ran out of ideas or got distracted from the main subject.  How the family turns around, the children's concern about their parents, the parent's relationship, etc., are described in detail and in a touching way.  What happened to the killer was very much a turn-off, although plausible, and it just didn't seem to fit the story well.  All in all, it's an enjoyable read; it just irritated me a little.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Distortions, half truths and innuendo. Moore could have easily given same treatment to Roosevelt and WW2 to make them look bad.<br /><br />The movie insults our intelligence and even the most apolitical among us can't help feeling manipulated. Though presented as a documentary, it's nothing more than a political hack job. The world according to Moore. And the worst sin of all, its incredibly boring.
B000059T00|5.0|Good lord these are powerful jams.  I think this is the one to turn up on a long fast drive.  Had to Cry Today is just out of this world.  These guys just knew how to improvise like nothing you've ever heard.  Truly a supergroup.  I think this is a good companion piece to live works of The Cream for obvious reasons.  Presence of the Lord and Can't Find My Way Home lend a very medieval English sound to this album, like listening to the Knights of the Round Table had they discovered rock and roll.   Ginger Baker's tune Do What You Like is the last one on the album and it is just a wild rhythmic masterpiece.  There is definitely a style to these songs, but it's a loose unity.  It feels like what it is: the hybrid of The Cream and Traffic.  The songs are all quite different from each other, but with one thing in common, once they get back to improvising, which they do in practically every tune, they go wild and you get to listen to talented musical stylists at their best.  It's like listening to jazz but amped up quite a few notches.  I could have this wrong, but I think Clapton used some pugilistic little pignose amp on this thing without any reverb half the time and it's just perfect and punchy.
B00006J3WH|5.0|First off, I love that the title of the musical is \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Besides the Buffy DVD sets series 1-7, this CD is the essential Buffy fan's must have item. I love to listen to this in my car and sing-it makes driving a lot more fun and less stressful. Joss and Buffy Co. should have gotten AWARDS GALORE for Buffy The Musical but unfortunately people prefer things like the show Frasier or whatever. Anyway, I'm just going to say it, I love Joss for having the guts and talent to pull off not only the show, but this AWESOME art form-the musical(and on TV!). You rock Joss! And Joss, if you ever read this-please please please don't let this be the end of the Buffyverse. Okay, enough groveling. If you don't already have the soundtrack-BUY IT!
B000002ITW|4.0|It's impossible not to notice the different directions that tug at CSNY and no surprise that Neil Young split while CSN lasted.  His dissonance is so powerful within the band that at times, when listening to Graham Nash songs, it's hard to believe these guys could be in the same band.  That said, often rock is at it's greatest when you have opposing musical forces tugging at eachother and just managing to put all their energy into working in concert.  The title is emblematic of what this collection is - a very interesting intersection of musical talent and styles.  But my favorite, is the long version of Southern Man.  Neil Young never played it better, because in this one, he's got Steve Stills working the rhythm guitar, and that son of a bitch can play.  Listening to those two guys dance around in and out of eachother in that extended jam is just one of the best jams ever kicked out during that time by any band.  Stills's rhythm guitar in this album makes Richie Havens look slow.  It's just a a terrific collection the tugs in every direction, but hell, that's the kind of forces that keep the damned planets moving, and you'll know it when you hear that Southern Man.
B00009MGQL|4.0|I bought this CD after finishing the latest book on the Yardbirds, one of my childhood favorites. Once again, I was reminded of the 'guitar heroes' of my youth (yes, I play guitar, 30+ years myself). His musical contributions are still relevant and sound great after all these years. This latest, \\"Jeff,\\" just kicked me in the gut when I put it on! I was laughing out loud. I had to pick up my guitar and try to follow along; it was awesome indeed. The two guys I really give a 'thumbs-up' to for lifetime achievement, continual new and fresh innovation and in fact 'youthful/playfulness' - regardless of their 'chronological age' - are Iggy Pop and Jeff Beck. Anyway, I think you should buy it, and the CRANK UP your stereo.
B000002KCC|5.0|I'm so glad to see all the other reviews on this album.  I remember picking up a copy of this album in a used record store for a buck back in the eighties.  I already owned all the really popular Young albums, and on first listen, like a lot of new Young fans, I didn't respond.  Then I came home one night a few months later and turned it on really late at night and laid down in bed.  There were lots of crackles and the album was a little scratched. On the cover he's wearing a seersucker jacket and huge aviator sunglasses.  He looks like he hasn't lifted his nose off the mirror in a year.  You can smell the tequila on him.  And it's just pure poetry.  Every bit the road-weary troubadour.  The lonesome hitchhiker poet.  It got to Tired Eyes that night as I was falling asleep, just such a wonderful weary tune.  And even now years later, I hear this album, the most sublime, raw thing that ever came out of the desert southwest and sigh in satisfaction.  I listened to this thing until I couldn't take it anymore.  It's a very unified album, not for sissies.  One gets the feeling that a few more Tonight's the Nights would have killed the guy.  He embodied a kind of rock and roll martyr at that point, a guy who watches his friends die and dies a little each day so we don't have to.  Great stuff.  The cover is in black and white and some of the songs have little stories that as he sings I always picture happening -- in black and white, and at night time.  Save this one for after midnight -- hell -- save it for after 2:30...
B00063MBU8|5.0|Who would've thought Simple Plan could've followed up to such an amazing debut album like that.  Well, they did and I think it's awesome!!  How could a CD not be good with a song like &quot;Welcome To My Life&quot; on it?  Simple Plan have definetly matched their first release, &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot;, they may have leaned towards a new sound for the new album &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; but, it is a great album none the less.  5 STARS!!
B00006879E|4.0|nice music!!!!! <br />I gave it 4 stars b/c most of the songs are good but not all, <br /> <br />best songs are: <br /> <br />harder to breathe(1st single) <br />this love(2nd single) <br />she will be loved(3rd single) <br />sunday morning(4th single) <br /> <br />You should get this cd
B0002XVQNU|4.0|I don't write a whole lot of these reviews, but this one I had to get off my chest.  If you, like many people, were disappointed with the theatrical release, GET THIS RELEASE NOW!!  The director obviously loved this project, and what you get here is his original vision.  This is not the kind of \\"director's cut\\" where they just add more screen minutes.  Whole scenes that were in the theatrical release are gone, and good riddance.  I have always hated the \\"must work in a love scene\\" mentality, whether the story being told needs it or not.  Of course Elektra is an important part of the story, history, and legend of what makes Daredevil who he is, but good lord, do I HAVE to see 'em smooching and stuff???  I digress...this version has what anybody going to see a superhero movie wants and expects: action, a respect for the traditions of the characters involved, and action.  Did I mention action?  And I haven't even told you about my favorite part yet!  That would be the Studio Schmuck that not only insisted on the version ultimately released (remember, this \\"director's cut\\" version was actually in the bag), but to compound his stupidity, he STILL insists (in the bonus featurette interview on the disc) that the theatrically released version is the better one!  Laughable!! You, sir (yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' to you, Mr. Studio Schmuck), are a MORON! <br />If you like your Hornhead gritty...buy. Now. Basta.
B00005JN0T|4.0|The special effects are wonderfully orchestrated in this film and the adapted storyline is refreshing and intruiging. However, Smith's character becomes increasingly annoying as the film progresses. His constant \\"I told you so\\" attitude is tiring and distracts from the story itself. Worth watching, but by no means a masterpiece.
B00003CXIP|4.0|Stand By Me was the first of three great movies made from Stephen King's collection of four novellas--Different Seasons. My favorite movie of all time, The Shawshank Redemption, was made from the story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It is the only movie ever made from a piece of King's fiction that transcends and is greater than the written original.<br /><br />Stand By Me was the first of the three movies to be made (the other being Apt Pupil). It is a great coming of age movie in its own right. Featuring a first-class cast of child actors (oh, the wasted potential now seen in their later years breaks the heart!), this movie may not transcend the story, but it certainly delivers the goods in a way that few movies made from King's works have done (The Green Mile springs to mind, but after it, Apt Pupil, and Shawshank, the drop-off is considerable).<br /><br />C.S. Lewis often spoke of Sensucht: the painful longing that itself is a joy. This movie, with its warts and all retelling a journey in the golden-hued past, powerfully evokes a feeling of sensucht. This feeling is eerily matched and accentuated while watching a young River Phoenix turn in one of his most powerful performances.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder if the fourth story of Different Seasons--The Breathing Method--will ever be made into a film. Its ending may ward off the faint of heart, but anyone who has ever heard the audio recording by Frank Muller could easily see its possibilities as a movie.<br /><br />I give Stand By Me my heartfelt recommendation.
0060594888|5.0|I have been a student of Jack Canfield for over a decade and have used the principles he teaches in this book to accelerate my own success and the success of the people I train and manage at the Henry Ford Museum.  This book has my highest recommendation. It will change your life.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I tend to avoid any movie labled a \\"SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER!\\" before it is even released. Hence, I have just now stumbled into a pleasant surprise upon my first viewing of Van Helsing. For what it is, this movie does its job quite well.<br /><br />I even wish I'd caught it at the theater (the effects and landscapes are something to behold).<br /><br />Hugh Jackman has yet to convert me from a bystander to a fan, but this movie is one of his better performances. The three brides of Dracula are excellent eye-candy. The Monster and Mr. Hyde are two of the film's highlights.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale has never impressed me--either as an actress or as a beauty (does she ever speak in more than a whisper in real life?), yet she pulls off a fun turn of bad horror-flick acting as a transylvanian princess/monster-slaying-broad. She makes a decent foil to Jackman.<br /><br />One could dismiss the attractions of this film as being the celluloid equivalent of watching ladies mudwrestle. The movie does hold that attraction. But in its cheap, tawdry, yet eye-popping way, this movie attains a perfection of its form (not mudwrestling, but as an ill-concieved, underwritten monster flick).<br /><br />Jackman and Richard Roxburgh lend the film if not gravitas, then a certain pathos.<br /><br />All this is to say that Van Helsing ends up being more than the sum of its parts. And the redheaded bride is cute.<br /><br />I give Van Helsing a surprised \\"it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.\\"
B0002EXFNI|4.0|This film's parent is the Tom Cruise cult classic, Risky Business.  The soundtrack in the opening scenes of The Girl Next Door was used in Risky Business, and the plot similarities are there as well.  Once again, we have a young man, in this case more precocious than the Cruise character, who encounters the sex industry before he actually enjoys sex.  Emile Hirsch has aspirations of attending Georgetown, where the good Jesuits would frown on his forays into the porn industry, and is swept away by a vision of an \\"angel,\\" as he refers to her, in the form of the Elisha Cuthbert, house-sitting at the neighbors.  Despite Hirsch's obvious intellectual talents, Cuthbert's character is wiser in the ways of the world, having earned a prominent position as a star in the closed world of porn.  So, Hirsch's character falls in love with Cuthbert's character, and then incurs the wrath of her porn pimp, Timothy Olyphant.  Olyphant's performance is nothing short of brilliant. Hirsch on ectasy during the dinner in which he is a speaker competing with other speakers for a scholarship to GU is almost funny, until at the pivotal moment of his speech Hirsch is no longer looped, but instantly profound and serious. At any rate, this is a fun film and audiences who are not uncomfortable with sex in the cinema will find much here to enjoy.  Once again, as if we didn't get the message the first time, Hollywood is telling us that, whatever else one accomplishes in youth, sexual maturity is the sine qua non of wisdom.  Why it has to involve \\"industrial sex,\\" in the form of prostitution or the porn business is not clear to me, but it seems to work as theatre.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is a great set of disc. Episode IV-VI are reenhanced and have some new digital and CG. I liked it the first time I watched it and I will always like it. The new Emporer CG is also good. Ian does the voice and is the image. Just they forgot to credit him for it. But the movie flows better and Geogre is a Genuis. I am looking forward to Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. It will complete the saga and we will know everything that George wants us to know about the Star Wars Universe.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris courageously tackles one of the last taboos of \\"modern\\" society -- faith -- and he does so unflinchingly and convincingly.  We pride ourselves on being a civilized society, yet we have a blind spot when it comes to the question of faith.  Although we resoundingly reject other \\"myths\\" of 2000 years ago -- such as the earth is flat -- we embrace the superstitions and myths of an ignorant and primitive civilization.<br /><br />There are things we know:  that Christ was born in March, not December 25, but his birthday was changed to make the religion more palatable to a pagan sector of society.  We know that Christ was likely crucified on a stake, not a cross.  And we know that the rabbis of the day were referred to as \\"Sons of God\\".  Yet we ignore even the simplest of details and continue to believe in a fairy tale of a virgin (how do we know this?) giving birth to the son of a Deity.  And, incidentally, this is a myth that has been perpetuated in pagan societies as well...a virtuous woman being impregnated by a God such as Zeus.<br /><br />Harris goes on to correctly state that the fundamental problem with Islam is its very core beliefs (which he quotes directly from the Koran).  Islam is like Christianity in the 14th century.  It is a religion out of control.  We now see what can occur when primitive beliefs coincide with weapons of mass destruction.  The outlook is scary unless we decide to question our beliefs instead of simply aping what our forefathers have believed.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I am a very serious fan of Alan Parsons since the Project Started with I Robot a long time ago this is the best SOLO work of Alan since the Project ended. I must admit i have a bend for electronica and Alan is experimenting with this media here, i also always prefered his instrumental works, there are quite a few on this album and those with lyrics are good too. Mammagamma o4 and a Recurring Dream within a Dream bring back memories that are nearly 30 years old what a nice gift for a devoted fan like me. All in all a must have CD for real Parsons fans
B00004THAY|4.0|This is a very good album that didn't quite reach my expectations (which were probably unrealistically high). Half the album are classic BB songs and the other half are blues covers. Highlights are an acoustic version of \\"Key To The Highway\\" and the King classic \\"Three O'clock Blues\\". Awesome talent behind these two legends as well, including Joe Sample, Andy Fairweather Low, Doyle Bramhall, Steve Gadd and Jimmy Vaughn joins them on a song.
B00003CXI1|5.0|When I watched this film it reminded me in spirit of films like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the original Wizard of Oz. Some of the cinematics, such as when they first arrive at Diagon Alley, are almost  breathtaking, at least IMO.<br /><br />Book purists may not be quite so fond of the film but if you love watching a good film, I recommend it.<br /><br />I remember thinking, the first time I saw it, that we had another holiday classic on our hands. ;-) This film takes us through Harry's adventures during his first year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We get to meet Albus Dumbledore, the Dean of the school, very reminiscent in some ways of Gandalf the White but with more of a sense of humor; Rubeus Hagrid, the half-giant, great big teddy bear (with a fondness and a blind spot towards dangerous magical creatures such as dragons); and the dark and mysterious Severus Snape, Potions Master at the school.<br /><br />Harry Potter, raised by muggles (non-wizarding folk) known as the Dursleys -- Vernon, Petunia and their son, Harry's cousin, Dudley, finds himself drawninto this adventure when he receives an acceptance letter from Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns things about himself, The Boy Who Lived, the only one to survive the dread Dark Lord Voldemort whose power was broken and who vanished with no trace on the night he tried to use a killing curse on Harry Potter. He learns that his parents did not die in an automobile accident, which is what Mr. and Mrs. Dursley had always told him.<br /><br />The school year is full of adventure and wonder and a quest to find and keep the Wizard's Stone (called 'Philosopher's Stone' in the book's British edition) from someone who's trying to steal it in order to gain the Elixir of Life. In this quest Harry and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, wrack their brains trying to figure out, with little information, how they can manage to help protect the stone from whoever's trying to steal it.<br /><br />Definitely worth the watch.ever's trying to steal it. <br /> <br />Definitely worth the watch.
B00005AFVR|5.0|If Bruce Springsteen was John Lennon than The E Street Band would be Paul McCartney. That's how much they compliment each other. It was a truly wonderful and moving experience to see and hear all these guys together again. Let's hope it happens in the studio as well so we can have Abbey Road instead of silly love songs.

B0006284JQ|5.0|WHY THE HECK ARE PEOPLE STILL BRINGING UP BRITNEY'S LIFE INTO A REVIEW ABOUT AN ALBUM?  Why are people still bringing her down and talking crap about her when people come her to see if her album is worth buying?  If supposely the public doesn't CARE about her life anymore, why the heck is EVERYONE including HATERS talking about her?  Hahaha!  SO ironic!  Britney was just at the Billboard Music Awards like a little while (aka an hour or so) ago and she looked SIMPLY AMAZING!  Did you hear ALL the crazy cheering for her?  It was INSANE!  This proves that TONS of people still love and support her.  Britney has not made a public appearance in like FOREVER and the fans STILL LOVE AND RESPECT HER!  I also agree with those who think that Britney being a \\"legend\\" (I'm not saying she is...yet) has absolutely NOTHING to do with how she lives her life!  MJ anyone?  Totally freaky and way CRAZIER than Brit!  And she DID NOT stage her knee injury...Why the heck would you even SAY that?  That's just mean and uncalled for!  There was audio of her during her concert when she had to cancel a few dates on the early leg of the Onyx Hotel Tour and you could hear she WAS IN PAIN!  Britney's also had history of a bad knee and there's simply no reason anyone should start accusing her of faking it!  And for those who are saying My Prerogative is bad...it's YOUR freakin' opinion!  I for one think it's MUCH better than Bobby's version.  It's true that I wasn't around when his version was popular, but I LOVE Britney's version of it, even if Rolling Stones hates it!  Actually I know tons of people who like it! <br /> <br />As for the album (had to defend Brit before praising her album!), it's really just (almost) all the singles she's released from day one including smash hits like BOMT, OIDIA, Slave, Toxic, and the like!  So basically if you've ever liked some of Britney's singles and didn't go for the albums because you thought they were filler (trust me...they're NOT!), PICK THIS UP!  I'm sure most fans of pop music will enjoy this album also!  Some people think the bonus CD is bad...but what exactly DO you expect from a bonus remix disc?  I actually think it's really good with tons of awesome remixes!  Love the Toxic and Outrageous mixes and the upbeat Everytime mix!  The Breathe On Me remix is aight, but you should definitely check out the original of In The Zone.  The megamix of Britney's hits ROCKS and is better IMO than megamixes I've heard of Madonna and Janet!  So all in all, this album really sums up the AWESOME music that Britney's released in the few years she's been a pop phenom!  Some really great stuff! <br /> <br />
B0002234LS|3.0|The Secret Window is a horror tale based on a Stephen King novel.  This is however, one of the better adaptations of a King novel.  Nonetheless, it is not unique in its presentation as it carries much similarity with films such as Brian de Palma's Raising Cain (1992) and the more recent Identity (2003).<br /><br />The second opening of the film has suggestive undercurrents to the theme of the film, as it cues the audience into the story.  The audience follows the camera lens in over a lake as it depicts a small rural house toward which the audience smoothly moves.  The audience moves in closer toward the house and in through a window as it finally faces a mirror through which the audience can see the main character sleeping on a coach.  The person sleeping is Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), a successful writer who has escaped his wife and divorce after having discovered her cheating on him six months ago in a local motel.<br /><br />When Mort wakes up from one of his afternoon naps a southern man by the name of John Shooter (John Turturro), demands justice as he insinuates that Mort has stolen his story.  Shooter gives Mort three days to rectify what he has done wrong, as he demands justice.  On the second day, Shooter kills Mort's dog.  Mort contacts the police, but the local police do not seem interested in his case, and in turn, he seeks help from a private agency that he has used in the past.  Nevertheless, the help Mort hired seems to be incapable to providing the help that he requested, as Shooter threatens him once more, this time inside his house, while the deadline draws nearer.<br /><br />David Koepp who wrote the screenplay for Spider-Man (2002) directs Secret Window, which brings a similar suspense that can be experienced in his other film Stir of Echoes (1999).  Johnny Depp as well as John Turturro enhance the cinematic experience through their great performances, as a well performing cast supports their parts.  As the end credit roll before the eyes of the audience they will have experienced a well-made film with the lesson of not trusting what one sees.experienced a well-made film with the lesson of not trusting what one sees.
B0002B15WE|4.0|John McTiernan was only in his mid thirties when he directed this fantastic film. He had just finished work on PREDATOR (1987). He has directed the two sequels, and they also were commercial successes. Presently he is wrapping work on DH4.<br /><br />The film was based on the novel, NOTHING LASTS FOREVER, by Richard Thorp. He also wrote THE DETECTIVE. The screenplay was by Stephen De Souza, and it originally was intended to be a sequel to his success with COMMANDO, but when Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped out of the project it all went a new direction. Jan De Bont did the cinematography, and as well as being a creative energetic lenser, he is a pretty good director; as in SPEED (1994), and TWISTER (1996).<br /><br />For Bruce Willis, this was only his third film, and he was trying hard to break out of his comedic mold, influenced by his success on MOONLIGHTING. This film was a breakthrough for him. He muscled his way into the testosterone ranks of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, and he has outlasted them, maintaining his status of action star for over 20 years. Playing New York cop, John McClane, he was the epitomy of the average guy who was thrown into a dangerous situation and had to rise to the occasion. The plot hook of this cop flying to LA over Christmas to try and reconcile with his wife set into motion a whole new genre. No longer did action heroes have to be super-trained Navy seals, or secret service assassins. They could be normal guys who happen to be tough and resolute when push comes to shove.<br /><br />As good as Willis was, much of the credit for the film's success had to go to Alan Rickman, who played charming intelligent villian, Hans Gruber. He was excellent. He seemed to pioneer the notion that an antagonist can be witty, smart, and well mannered, as well as lethal. Rickman, a fine actor, went on to do other brilliant turns as villians in QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER (1990), and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991). Of course, he is enjoying great success these days as Professor Snape in the HARRY POTTER series.<br /><br />The supporting cast were quite good as well. Bonnie Bedelia played McClane's estranged wife, Holly. 90% of her career has been in TV films, but she is very effective in this part. I also loved her as Shirley Muldowney in HEART LIKE A WHEEL (1983). Reginald Veljohnson was fine as Sgt. Al Powell of the LAPD. He became the touchstone for McClane throughout the picture, keeping a running conversation going with him. There were some overdone rah-rah Brotherhood of the Badge moments, but generally their relationship worked. Alexander Godunov played Gruber's main henchman, Karl. His portrayal was a bit one-note, all snarl and not much inner conflict, but he looked the part, and as a great ballet dancer he moved well in the fight scenes. Paul Gleason played the deputy Chief of Police, and his role was thankless. There was a kind of dumb subplot to establish the ineptness of the LAPD, and he was a front man for all the foolishness. Sometimes this ploy slowed down the thrust of the action. William Atherton played a ruthless TV reporter, and we got to dislike him before the story wound down. As an actor, he specializes in cads and misfits. Robert Davi, usually a film heavy, did a comic relief turn as a dumb FBI agent; one of a pair, both named Johnson.<br /><br />I liked this film. It established a new kind of action movie; one that comes at us at pile driver speed, complete with pyrotechnics, comedy, and wicked gunbattles. It is like as two hour ride on a roller coaster.ess these days as Professor Snape in the HARRY POTTER series.  <br /> <br />The supporting cast were quite good as well.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|Looking into ones own past and recognizing the mistakes that have been made is a sign of wisdom.  The director Errol Morris intelligently devises ways to share this wisdom of Robert Strange McNamara, who willingly shares his life lessons with a higher purpose, which is to educate younger generations.  McNamara shares 11 of his lessons through verbal recollection and archived films.  This cinematic enlightenment covers the time from McNamara's birth to the time of the shooting of the film.  However, the film focuses on the time from World War II to his leave of office as United States Secretary of Defense.<br /><br />Errol Morris, a diligent documentary filmmaker, has made films such as Thin Blue Line (1988), Cheap, Fast, and Out of Control (1997), and Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. (1999).  These films depict stories regarding death row inmates, corrupt systems, eccentric characters, and the electric chair designer.  Robert S. McNamara, on the other hand, is known as the former General Manager for the Ford Motor Company, the Vietnam War architect, and the World Bank president. McNamara, well educated and intellectually gifted, approached all the jobs given to him with a strong methodological approach, which he supported from lessons he had learned previously in life.  Thus, Morris who often portrayed people's lives becomes a perfect match for McNamara who appears to want to share his lessons with the world in order to create an ever-growing source of enlightenment without causing further tribulations.<br /><br />The documentary is organized in such manner that the objective of the lesson is evident, which is an essential tool for all teachers.  All lessons begin with a black screen with white text that states the lesson, for example, \\"No. 1 Empathize with your enemy\\", \\"No. 5 Proportionality should be a guideline of war\\", and \\"No. 10 Never say never\\".  From the objective screen, the film transitions to McNamara who begins to narrate directly to the audience about what he wants to have said, as he teaches the viewers from his mistakes.  Through the eyes of McNamara, the audience gets to see how he reacts as he discloses choices he's made in his past and how he remembered people.  This becomes very poignant as McNamara tells his story, especially when his eyes turn full of tears. Morris capture this moment through Interrotron, which is technology that captures the moment in first person.<br /><br />The lessons shared dive into the history of World War II and the bombing of Japan, which was a result of research made by McNamara and others.  The many bombs dropped on Japanese soil led to the death of several hundred thousand people along with fire and atomic bombs.  McNamara also shares his lessons learned while advancing within the hierarchy of the Ford Motor Company.  McNamara's time at the Ford Motor Company led him into getting the job as United States Secretary of Defense, which forced him to face the Cuban missile crisis.  He then reflects on how near the United States and the world was to a nuclear war.  The simple deduction by McNamara was that they avoided a nuclear conflict by the chance of luck. In the back of McNamara's head were the results of World War II and the Cuban Crisis, as he had to deal with the looming Vietnam conflict.  The Kennedy assassination might have changed the course of the Vietnam conflict as McNamara recalls, as his eyes slowly fill with tears.<br /><br />The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara offers a truly spectacular cinematic experience as it becomes a personal experience through the camera work of the film.  McNamara's past, right or wrong, offers many important lessons, which the audience should ponder, as there is a real nuclear threat in the world.  In conclusion, McNamara tries his personal best to make the world a better place, as he observes it with his own life long experiences.y to the audience about what he wants to have said, as he teaches the viewers from his mistakes.

B000696PWC|5.0|It sounds like the negative reviews were written by complete non-fans, so their opinions don't really justify this body of work.    Disc #2 is a gem--Pretty much every single on here is golden, with standouts being \\"Confide In Me\\", \\"Did It Again\\", \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow\\", \\"Kids\\", \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", \\"Slow\\", and \\"Chocolate\\". If you are from the USA, you may only know about 2 or 3 songs on this CD. I therefore recommend that you buy this immediately so you can see what Americans have been missing.    Disc #1? Well, let's just say Kylie was still a pop-puppet/novice then; I wouldn't bother playing it except to listen to some cheesy, fun 80's dance music, and to see how much Kylie has grown.    Overall, Ultimate Kylie is the definitive Minogue collection. It is set to be released in the USA on 2/1/05: don't miss out on it.
B0002S94OS|3.0|Average Slayer influenced metal.  Nothing special, not bad and not great either.  I don't care for the generic singer, he sounds way too nu metal for my tastes.  The band are pretty good musicians if unoriginal.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Let me start by saying that I have not read the book so I can not comment on the Difference.  That said, this is a very good movie.  One of the best action/Spy movies I have ever seen.  And yes, Matt does a great job!  The only thing I can say is that I am glad I saw the movie first, because acording to everyone there seems to be some major differences.  But still great Movie.  Go see it.
B0006UFZNQ|2.0|The video quality of this _King Kong_ (1933) DVD from Cheezy Flicks Entertainment is about the same as the NTSC VHS source from which it appears to have been copied. The DVD has a pasty looking picture which suffers from a total lack of contrast and there are occasional VHS-style video dropouts. The picture is off centered to the left and has excessive overscan. The \\"deleted\\" scenes are all way too dark. The crude cover art is composed of fuzzy screen shots. The ONLY advantage to the Cheezy Flicks _King Kong_ DVD is that it has reasonably good audio and the movie is presented in its original, 100-minute length, not the 96-minute length of sped up PAL versions. This alone makes the DVD worth keeping. <br /> <br />This Region 1 NTSC disc was made on a DVD burner. It has an English soundtrack, no subtitles and comes with a printed label. The package is an Amaray-style case with an insert sheet that lists the 13 chapters, but the chapters are not numbered. <br /> <br />There are persistent rumors that Warner Bros. will be releasing a superduper Region 1 DVD of the original _King Kong_ (1933) by the end of the decade. In the meantime, this Cheezy Flicks NTSC version sounds better than a sped up PAL version and, for those who really love Fay Wray, it is definitely better than no _King Kong_ at all. Hearing Fay Wray scream on key is what it's all about.
B000007489|5.0|If you dig punk rock there are no dissapointments here! This truely is a MUST HAVE for any punk fan. It's not \\"Old School\\" it's TIMELESS.  If you dig Pennywise, System of a Down or Bad Religion. You'll dig this. It's not as polished as those bands, but that just makes the raw energy feel so real. You can hear Suicidal's influence in new artists, tho no one ever mentions them. Listen to Slipknot's new disc, you'll hear Suicidal on there. <br /> <br />Another must have to check out is \\"DRI - Dealing with it\\"   <br /> <br />If your into the pop rock music currently being marketed as punk rock, you'll be pleasantly rewarded with the truth when you listen to this CD. I would give it 10 stars!! <br />
B000002JNJ|5.0|I just heard that Dimebag was murdered at a Damageplan concert tonight, and I wanted to come and pay my respects.  Dimebag was an amazing musician, and a really cool guy.  It makes me so sick that stuff like this has to happen.  Rest in peace, man.  We'll miss you, and we'll never forget you. :(
B0006399FS|3.0|It started out with a bang, and then fizzled. The music on this CD is amazing. The vocals are boring and uninspired with the exception of \\"Vertigo\\" and one other track. I am glad I borrowed it from a friend and sat down for a listen before making the purchase. This is just my opinion and maybe I had too high of expectations based on the strength of \\"Vertigo\\". I gave it three stars because the band put together some really interesting music for the songs.
0743424425|5.0|this is one of the best book I have ever read. Stephen King does a wonderful job.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The band tightened up all the way around for this CD, yet they still retain the appocolyptic rage of their roots. The slow songs are sung with skill and feeling, the lyrics are tite, the audio quality is off the hook. Excellent effort!! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|It is meant to be background music, but it is still good music.  It is very relaxing.
B000001F3C|5.0|If your looking back at U2's old releases because you bought the new one with Vertigo on it, buy this one, it is the inspired version of the band, this CD is excellent.
B0006399FS|2.0|On this latest U2 recording Onob still sounds like he still hasn't found what he's looking for.  Boring rehashed music with trite lyrical themes alot of which seem like Hallmark card versions of something Bob Dylan could do much better.  Overrated, Overdramatic, Overproduced Weepy music for Babies!
B00005JNEI|5.0|As a a devout Christian, patriotic American, filmmaker, and artist... I am proud of Michael Moore for creating such an important source of fact-checked, accurate information to educate the next generation.  Thank you Michael - America owes you a great debt of gratitude!
B000000W6F|5.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i dont up in the same category either. <br /> <br />If you have no problem with distortion then Gish may seem like an endless land of pure artistry. First, you need the proper pieces. James Iha is one of my favorite guitarists of the '90s. the solos scream louder and his colouring is beuatiful in the soft parts. Billy Corgan's voice is so antiithesis. He screams but his voice is so soft it very much overrun by the distortion, very appealing in a shy sort of way. And finally Jimmy Chamberlain, what he does with ghost notes and just ruffing places is beautiful, one of the greatest alternative drummers ever. put it all together and you get something fantastic. Unlike the other pumpkins' albums, gish just jams out the tracks. The artists are free to do as they please and they have a lot of room. They put everything together nicely, almost like mind candy. The one big thing you might notice about this album is dynamics, gish played around with dynamics way more than many bands do, very notceable in \\"Bury Me\\". the first two songs sort of jam out rock music, the main thing is how loose all the players are. iha's solos, chamberlain's little fills colour the songs. but the first two are only an introduction to the masterpieces they lay ahead. \\"Snail\\", \\"Suffer\\", \\"Crush\\", and \\"Window Paine\\" clearly seem to be the heart of the album. each song multi layered with painstakingly good riffs, solos, and stories. They all seemed like journeys started humbly and leading to a climax then coming back down. \\"Rhinoceros\\" which is the single from the CD is a clear precursor to the big four. \\"Rhinoceros\\" first appeared on the lull EP and showed the beginning to such beuatiful music. \\"daydream\\" seemed to be an artistic statement in itself with just an acoustic and simple riff and the bonus track is just band having fun. The song structure was excellent, the complexity was about right, the vocals were too unique. this is what a rock band is about, i would buy this album before delving into any deeper Pumpkins.
B0006399FS|1.0|I echo the sentiments of many longtime U2 fans here. I've been around since the early days when the music had passion. I stayed thru the glizty electronic phase, and even appreciated POP. But I felt that they were losing it. When ATYCLB came out, I had hope that the U2 that we all knew were coming back. <br /> <br />I was in Scotland a few months back and read an interview in a UK magazine where Bono said this record was \\"the record they've been wanting to make for the last 15 years\\" or so. I got excited. Then I heard Vertigo. Over. And Over. And Over. Disappointing and discouraging. Memories of the K-Mart POP marketing campaign came back. Then the rest of this CD comes out. It's garbage. I'm all for bands trying new things and new directions, but they don't sound like they are even trying anymore. And where's the passion? Where's the fire? In this time of political turmoil, doesn't U2 have something to say? Bono seems to do it alone in front of the UN, but then leaves the music bland and tasteless. <br /> <br />Skip it. Its better to ignore this than to let it taint your perspective on what was, and really should still be, one of the best bands of the last 30 years.
B000067J1H|5.0|The best description of the movie I can think of is this: \\"Walter Mitty meets Apocalypse Now\\". Superbly acted by some greats- Norton, Pitt, and the the always wonderful Helena Bonham Carter (who is quite believable in her difficult role). Everybody has already said that it's great, and why, so I'll just say, buy it.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Not only great music.. Live in Concert in Bucharest is NOT to be overlooked.<br /><br />The DVD included with this 5 disc set is beyond anything you could ever imagine. It's wonderfully bizzare and feels very personal. I can't say I've ever seen anyone act so enraptured, just over taken in ecstasy by the songs and by the pouring adoration of the crowd as Michael acts throughout this concert. During 'Human Nature' he most literally seems as if he's getting off on the whole experience. It's beautiful and possibly as close to full fledged unstrained emotion we will ever see from him as the public. When I say \\"bizzare\\" I... I mean bizzare -and as a general description that covers every aspect of the concert, but it's a GOOD bizzare. It's deeply appealing and not like anything you'll ever see.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|Right up front, let me say that I am NOT a fan of this movie.  But I know lots of people are, and I'm not about to start tearing it apart because I find it too treacly...much more than a spoonful of sugar in this flick.  BUt, there's no sense reviewing it.  I'm a 40 year old man, my opinion of this film is not terribly important.  Nor can I comment on whether kids will still like it...neither of mine can be coerced into watching it. <br /> <br />But the DVD CANNOT BE FAULTED. It's packed full of features that will make any fan of the movie drool.  Looks and sounds great! If you like Mary Poppins, then I highly recommend this DVD.  Some recent Disney DVD releases felt a bit thrown together, and the \\"special edition\\" label was a stretch.  But this one reminds me of the SNOW WHITE release. Lots of truly meaty and entertaing stuff for the lover of the movie..the definitive edition.
B000002G7G|5.0|Sure drug addiction is a very sad subject, but the Velvets made it seem more so horrifying on their first 2 albums than it was sad. This was in large part due to John Cale, and his avant garde background. After those first 2 monumental albums, it seemed the Velvets sang about drug addiction,  S&M, and other dark topics, over loud guitars, violas, pounding drums, and screeching feedback, and that was about it. But then something happened to the band, besides the departure of John Cale. I don't know what it was, maybe Lou had his drug ruined heart broken by some beauty, but I am not the one to ask. No matter what the circumstances, this is a beatufiul album. There is no feedback, or violas, or anything experimental(well maybe the Murder Mystery) on this album. They really seemed to become a POP BAND on this album. But of course not in the strictest sense of the word. They were still the Velvets, but they had lost one of their guiding forces, and gained Doug Yule, who proobably had a big part to do with the toning down of the bands noise. Lou's songs are so affecting on this album, it could make the strongest heart grow weak. Candy Says, Some Kind of Love, Pale Blue Eyes(one of the best songs ever recorded), Jesus, and I'm Set Free are some of the most moving ballads you are ever destined to hear, while they still show their ability to play a rock n roll song, twice i might mention, in What Goes On, and Beginning to See the Light. These aren't your Sister Ray type of rockers. Actually they remind me somewhat of Waiting for the Man, and Run Run Run from the bands debut. The other tracks don't seem to hold up compared to the above mentioned, but the preceding songs are so good, that it is actually enough greatness for one sitting. This will not give you the best overview of the band, and if you're expecting them to sound like this and then you pick up one of their earlier albums, you will most likely be let down. You need to start with the debut, because it is one of themost historic recordings in music history, then get White Light/White Heat because it is yet another look into the bands more avant garde days(which didn't last long i should say), THEN you need to get Loaded, because of course you have to have Sweet Jane and Rock n Roll in your record collection somewhere, even though the album is much better than those 2 songs. This is actually the last Velvets album you should purchase, because after the noise of the first 2, and the rock n roll of the last one, this let's you come down from the musical high you are floating upon from experiencing THE GREATEST American band ever.
B0000541AM|5.0|The Warriors are a mixed-race street gang from Coney Island.  They travel 'far' to the Bronx to attend a sort of gang 'conference' arranged by one group that wants to consolidate gang power in New York and run the city.  (Yeah, this was NYC in the 70s, not Guiliani-era.)  But one gang member decides to just blow away the new leader and then pin the blame on the Warriors, for 'no reason'.  The Warriors have to fight their way back to Coney Island all night, encountering gang after gang and avoiding the (totally inept) NYPD.<br /><br />Great photography, great characters, tons of style and color make this a fun movie and a cult favorite.  Apparently it provoked gang violence in movie theaters in 1979, yet it comes off as being truly from another time completely.  And of course, there are plans to remake it.  How thoughtful.  Based loosely on Sol Yurick's novel.<br /><br />The DVD looks pretty good, though I have a suspicion that with the impending remake (and Yurick's book back in print) we may well see a Deluxe version in the future.  The Warriors deserve it, after all.  The film hasn't looked better.  There are some great scenes of the various gangs gearing up for the night to hunt down The Warriors.  Lots of subway action, and the film takes place almost entirely at night, with dark blacks, and rich colors for the motley gangs.<br /><br />David Patrick Kelly is brilliant as Luther, the crazed Rogue gang member who looks frighteningly like Geddy Lee of Rush on a bender.  He has the famous 'Waaarriors...come out to plaaay-ay!' sequence where he clinks bottles together on his fingers over and over.'  That's acting.  The film also features another enduring quote, namely 'Can you diiiiiiiig it?!'<br /><br />The Warriors is a lot of fun.  It's colorful theater, and most of the extras were dancers and were able to pull off the fluid fight scenes.  Also, the gangs are fun.  The Baseball Furies look like a cross between KISS and the NY Yankees.  And what's with the bee-colored gang with the roller-skating leader?  You know you're in 1979...<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Make sure to have three empty beer bottles ready for the ending...the bee-colored gang with the roller-skating leader?

B0002F6AZC|5.0|Three stories of terror introduced by the Creep (in animation form) who appears to have the same sense of macabre humor as the Crypt Keeper from Tales from the Crypt. The stories even begin the same way as match shots from comic-book to film. The first story is called 'Old Chief Woodenhead'. George Kennedy stars as an old convenience store owner who is robbed and killed by a bunch of 80's punks. His Indian statue comes alive and avenges his death. This story is probably the least entertaining and takes a while to get going.<br /><br />Story number 2 is called 'The Raft' focuses on 4 teenagers out to have a good time at a secluded lake. But a huge sludge monster is out to eat them all up. This is probably the best story as it is very fast-paced and engaging.<br /><br />The last, and longest story is 'The Hitchhiker' in which a rich, cheater (Lois Chiles) runs over the titular character and is haunted by his corpse all the way home until she loses her mind. This is quite a cool story with some interesting direction. Stephen King has a cameo as a trucker. Tom Savini (seriously) appears as the live action Creep and the beginning and end of the movie.<br /><br />As part of Anchor Bay's Divimax series the image and sound of Creepshow 2 is top-notch. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is surprisingly beautiful and free of anything remotely resembling dirt, artifacts or pixalization. Black levels and fleshtones are suspiciously natural and color fidelity is superb. One wonders how such and old, and little seen, film can look so good. And although the soundtrack is remastered from plain and simple Mono it is still an above average presentation when compared to modern sound mixes. The sound is clear and crisp and is free of hiss or distortion. Kudos to Anchor Bay on this transfer.<br /><br />For extras we get a commentary from director Michael Gornick, a documentary called 'Nightmares in Foam Rubber' about the creation of the make-up effects (rather boring), two trailers, a photo gallery with shots of behind the scenes activity and the script is in PDF form when inserted into a DVD-ROM drive. Nice menus too.<br /><br />A must have for horror fans and Steven King affectionados. Even if you haven't seen the first film (like me) this is still a must have and a definite keeper. Very few people are likely to feel shortchanged after watching this movie.a photo gallery with shots of behind the scenes activity and the script is in PDF form when inserted into a DVD-ROM drive.

B0001611DI|5.0|The divimax edition is the best(and practically only) dvd for anyone who wants Dawn of the Dead, but doesn't need three extra discs of extras, along with the extra price, to see it.<br /><br />It has the original theatrical release. You don't get however many extra minutes from the director's cut, but to me that's alright, I'm usually happy when the movie ends. If it was any longer, I don't know that I could sit through it. Not that it's too gory or super boring, it's just a bit slow. Not much really happens. It's great to watch the people interact, and I don't need any extra footage to get the point.<br /><br />The extras are decent. Commentary with Romero and his wife and Savini. Radio spots. Enough for anyone who just needs the movie, not all the details.<br /><br />That's basically it. If you're not enough of a fan to want the Ultimate Edition, this is a fine edition to get instead.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|La peor pelicula de Tom Cruise, lo cual es mucho decir (cual ha sido buena?).
B0006399FS|2.0|There were only 522 reviews by the time I got here. I felt a 523rd was warranted.   <br />I've been a U2 fan since I first listened to a tape of their live album Under a Blood Red Sky. Since then I've witnessed a series of marvelous albums, followed in recent years by signs of a band in decline (a few years of dilly-dallying post-Zooropa, then the sub-par Pop, and then the safe and overall solid 'All that...'). <br />I have to say that compared to the work U2 have done in the past, this album sorely lacks quality at all levels-  lyrics, riffs, rhythms, melodies, hooks, ambience, attitude.  'Bomb' has very little of these, and I don't think this is an album that will \\"grow on\\" me like many other reviewers suggest.  Most of the songs sound tepid, and Bono sounds like he's trying too hard to find a melody that's just not coming to him.  For the first time, Edge's guitar sounds tired and out of ideas.  No solos such as the glittering 'Streets', the expressively minimalist 'Love is Blindness', or even the driving 'Do you feel loved?'.  It honestly sounds like \\"B-sides, Volume II\\".  After a  <br />promising 'comeback' with 'All that...', this album is a huge disappointment for me.  The string of poor U2 songs of late (the boring 'Hands that Built America' from Gangs of New York soundtrack; the very unelectric and static 'Electrical Storm' from the most recent Best-of CD;  the terrible songs from the even more terrible movie 'Million Dollar Hotel') and now this weak effort are signs of a content band lacking creativity, riding on their past laurels.  I still have faith that if U2 really want to, that they can make another great album.  This one definitely isn't IT.
B0002Z0EYA|1.0|Absurda y ridicula version de lo que fue Troya, que pena botar el dinero de esa manera.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania time and time again has made my day a little brighter with her albums and now I can hear all the songs I liked from older records on one.  Only a true fan could appreciate the work she has done for so many us with her music.  I must admit her looks played a part in it when I was a teen ager but now I am older and smarter and enjoy her music along with her looks
B000002513|5.0|THE WILD, THE INNOCENT, & THE E STREET SHUFFLE is a great early album by Bruce Springsteen, although he got even better when he ditched the story songs for gritty realism with the follow-ups, BORN TO RUN, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, and THE RIVER. This album does, however contain the immortal \\"Rosalita\\", plus several other wonderful numbers that have been, sadly, forgotten over the years. You should buy this one if you can find it.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem. Singer, actress, and the lastest soap-opera star turned singer. When I first got hold of Innocent Eyes to review, I was doubtful that there would be any substance in this album, and that, the album would like other actress-singer ones, full of cliques and inconsistencies. <br /> <br />However, whe I first heard Innocent Eyes, I was blown away. Nearly all of the songs were piano-based, yet all had a slightly different style to it. Being a professional CD reviewer for the last 3 years, and being around the music industry for a long time, this album blew me away. With a Alicia Keys-esque style to her music, Delta Goodrem will become the next BIG THING from Down Under, and she is almost there, with 5 number hits from THIS ALBUM ALONE, 1 million copies sold alone in Australia, and 9 ARIA Awards (the Australian version of the Grammys). <br /> <br />1. Born To Try: The opener of this album, and one of the most utterly most inspirational songs on this album. Delta mixes her talented piano-playing with her choral mistress-esque vocals together, leaving us with Born To Try. With uplifting major chords and a slight acoustic guitar in the background, Delta pulls this song off very well! <br /> <br />2. Innocent Eyes: The second track. This piece of music is very autobiographical, and Delta wears her heart on her sleeve. The piece itself is a little darker, and edgier, with electric guitars being added in the arrangements. With edgy vocals and a catchy chorus, Delta pulls off this song very well. <br /> <br />3. Not Me, Not I: After the edgy Innocent Eyes, Delta slows things down with a song about heartbreak. With a starting off with a simple piano and very emotional tone-of-voice, Delta leads the song through a series of changes, eventually gearing it up to a huge crescendo, full of her soaring vocals and a heartfelt orchestral arrangement. <br /> <br />4. Throw It Away: With Not Me, Not I still resonating in your mind, Delta picks the pace up again with Throw ItAway. A piece driven solely by acoustic guitar. However, my only two complaints with this song is that one: it is sometimes hard to tell what Delta is trying to sings, as a few of her words are blurred into others, and two: this song borderlines on a very ordinary pop tune, with parts os it sounding like something Kylie Minogue may have sung in the past. <br /> <br />5. Lost Without You: Lost Without You leads listeners back into the darker and edgier side of Delta's debut album. With very heartfelt vocals, and an edgy sound, Delta seems to soar through this piece with ease. With a song about losing someone you love, Delta conveys a heartfelt message into a very catchy song. <br /> <br />6. Predictable: Straight after Lost Without You, Delta keeps her edgy sound intact with Predictable. A rocky ballad full of Delta's (once again) edgier vocals, haunting piano and abrasive electric guitar. With the message of this piece about saying no to a boy, because she knows that he is too predictable, and will break her heart, Delta shows a different side to her. <br /> <br />7. Butterfly: Once again, Delta loses her edgier side to her album, to instead being you a very beautiful ballad. With the piano arrangment echoing in the background, Delta sings her heart out, backed in the chorus, with what seems like a choir. <br /> <br />8. In My Own Time: A very original song about writers block, Delta and her piano soar through this hauntingly beautiful piece. <br /> <br />9. My Big Mistake: With this song about a relationship, Delta, piano and a very pop-esque backing track go through this piece with the results, being, well...a little bland. <br /> <br />10. This Is Not Me: Unfortunately, with this song, Delta is doing basically the same thing with what she did with My Big Mistake. And, unfortunately, the results are...bland. <br /> <br />11. Running Away: The second guitar driven song on the album, Delta gets back into form by singing a truely wonderful song, with mid-tempo driving guitar and edgy vocals. With a Corrs-esque feel to this song, Delta proves that she is more than just a pretty face. <br /> <br />12. A Year Ago Today: A very emotional piece with Delta singing about a dearly departed friend. Accompanied by simple minor chords, Delta adds her emotional vocals on top to get a result that can put chills up spines and get people reaching for the paper tissues because they are overcome with emotion. <br /> <br />13. Longer: A interesting piece that once again borders on the edge of being something that maybe Kylie could have sang. <br /> <br />14. In My Own Time: The last piece of this stunning debut album. Instead of going out with a bang, Delta chooses the subtle way out, with a very heartfelt song about love. With angelic vocals and simple piano, the song resonates in your head for a long time afterwards.  <br /> <br />All in all, this debut album proves that Delta has talent, and I congratulate her for that! This album is an autobiography, one we should be listening to!
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|RAY CHARLES <br />Genius Loves Company <br />And what company the legendary Charles keeps on his (sadly) final recording: Norah Jones, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor, Elton John, Van Morrison. Ray's voice may be a little rough around the edges, but the results are still pure magic. If you don't own a Ray Charles disc, this is a good place to start. When he sings \\"You Don't Know Me\\" with Diana Krall, it's a poignant passing of the torch. See the movie! Buy the CD! You won't regret either choice.
B00004W510|5.0|To quote Graham Nash (among others), The Band was \\"the greatest group ever!\\". Eric Clapton says that the Band's first album, \\"Big Pink\\" changed his life, but the second album is even better. <br /> <br />Amidst the psychedelia of the late 60's, The Band's work holds up as fresh and original now as it did then. Big Pink was a great debut record, but the \\"brown album\\" put The Band on the cover of Time magazine. <br /> <br />Every song on the album is great. The Band pulled from blues, gospel, country, New Orleans jazz, and rock 'n roll, so the music itself defies easy labeling. <br /> <br />The Band had three great singers - Richard Manuel, Levon Helm and Rick Danko - each of whom had their own distinctive styles. They traded off vocals as well as harmonized, but not in the traditional Beach Boys or Beatles style. <br /> <br />The album itself opens up with Across The Great Divide, sung by Maunel, which paints a picture of a lost time in America, but is also funny and hopeful. Every song is great.  <br /> <br />The musicianship is unparalled. Between them, The Band commanded almost 20 instruments. Levon Helm, for my money the best drummer ever, gave up his drum stool on almost half the album to Richard Manuel. Helm played electric guitar (Jemima Surrender), mandolin (Rag Mama Rag, Rockin Chair and Unfaithful Servant)and harmonica. Danko played bass, violin and trombone! Garth played almost everything. <br /> <br />The most noted tracks are Up On Cripple Creek, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down and Rag Mama Rag, but I don't have a favorite. If I could only listen to one album therest of my life, this would be it - and I wouldn't be bored. Still number one on my stereo after 35 years. <br /> <br />10 out of 10! Buy this album!!!! <br />
B00018D44U|5.0|Forget the hype. Forget the Grammys. Forget that damn sweet-as-it-is-I-sure-as-hell-wish-they'd-play-something-else song \\"Dont Know Why.\\" Norah is back a little wiser, a little bluesier and a whole lot richer. If you couldnt get enough of her debut release \\"Come Away With Me,\\" you'll soon find out why her new disc truly \\"Feels Like Home.\\" And if you still can't get enough of Miss Jones, check out her guest appearance on \\"Remembering Patsy Cline.\\" Memo to Janet and Brittany: there's a difference between sexy and seXXX-y. And guess which sells more records?
B0002IQHY8|3.0|OK Alan, you know I blindly buy anything you produce. And like Time Machine, A Valid Path required a few listens before I came to the conclusion that I bought something good. But I've been a fan since Turn Of A Friendly Card (easily your best offering) and I even loved Vulture Culture despite the critics trashing it. For the very first time, I like the \\"airplay\\" tune (More Lost Without You) as the best cut on an APP album. The fade out of Tijuaniac and lead into L'Arc En Ciel is nothing short of genius. Anyone who can turn dripping water into a fantastic beat is one hell of a producer and the clarity is amazing. Everything else kind of rambles on. But in all fairness, the sound quality is awesome and the special effects make this an album I will listen to over and over again. The first time I cranked it up on my 750 Watt Onkyo 6.1 system was when I realized that this is a keeper. Not like any other APP albums and certainly not among my top 5. But it's one of those \\"mood albums\\" that you can easily listen to from end to end and is as crisp as it gets. I was never a \\"techno\\" fan but this album definately pushes the envelope in the right direction. Despite the 3 star rating I give it, this is buy. But this could have easily been a 5 star if Alan had put a little more effort into it and as a long time fan, I know he's capable of much better.
B0002MPU1K|3.0|If jazz artists improve with age, 21-year-old Peter Cincotti might by a legend by the time he hits 30. On his sophomore disc, he proves he's more than just Harry Connick: The Next Generation. He's not afraid to take risks (imagine Rodgers & Hammerstein \\"Bali Ha'i\\" with a funky blues groove), walking the finest line between pop and jazz. His take on \\"You Don't Know Me\\" is equal parts Ray Charles and Billy Joel, but his rendition of Carole King's \\"Up On the Roof\\" is far more optimistic and romantic than any of its previous incarnations. And his original composition, \\"On the Moon,\\" has Meg Ryan romantic comedy theme song written all over it. \\" This song alone is worth the price of the CD.
B00005R62N|5.0|Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East is a great live album which had very few overdubs and has killer versions of The Ripper, Sinner, Victim of Changes and Hell Bent for Leather. Duran Duran's Arena, on the other hand, was a studio album disguised as a live album as you had little girls going ga-ga over those lousy Roxy Music come David Bowie facsimiles named after a stinking Jane Fonda flick! Long live Priest!
B000002JK2|5.0|Absolutely essential to fans of rock or rock n roll. Highly recommended!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I am a fan of all types of music, and before \\"Fallen\\" I really didn't have a FAVORITE.  But Evanescence quickly changed all that.  The band is simply amazing.  I don't know how else to describe them.  Amy Lee has the MOST gorgeous voice I have ever heard on the radio.  My favorite songs on the album are \\"Taking Over Me\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" <br /> <br />I've read several of the other reviews, and I must say that I am simply appalled by some of them.  It is all well and good to dislike a band or a certain style of music, but let's be mature about our critiques, shall we?  To say that Amy is \\"talentless\\" is completely and utterly UNTRUE.  You may not like her, you may not like her voice, but you cannot honestly say to me or to anyone else who TRULY LISTENED TO THE ENTIRE ALBUM as well as their older works, that Amy cannot sing.  Her pitch is perfect, her tone is crystal clear, and you can FEEL the emotion radiating from her when she opens her mouth.  Do you think just ANYBODY can hit those notes?  Because if so, well, then, we'd all be very rich wouldn't we? <br /> <br />If you are a fan of beautiful vocals and gorgeous musical arrangements that range from classical to rockin', then you will enjoy Evanescence and you will love \\"Fallen.\\"
B00003CXXP|4.0|[Contains slight spoilers.] First of all, this is not a movie for kids. It is too deep and the underlying themes are for adults.  <br /> <br />Second, this is an odd production, because it was worked on by both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Spielberg took over the project when Kubrik died. I was excited when I heard a Kubrick movie was coming out that wasn't a strong R, but then I was disappointed to see what Spielberg did to it. Spielberg spoiled the movie wherever he touched it. Kubrick's and Spielberg's styles are like oil and water - they don't mix. Kubrick created a deep, original movie with great sci-fi elements. But then Spielberg added in some of his worst characteristics as a director - goofy cartoons, a sappy ending, etc. (Sort of like `Spartacus' meets `Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.) <br /> <br />Having said all that, I still recommend you see this movie at least once - just try to ignore the Spielberg elements. If you stop watching after the scene near the end when the kid is talking to the statue of a woman (you'll know what I mean when you see it) it will be a better and more profound experience.  <br /> <br />This was a very thought-provoking movie for me. How do we really view others around us? Would we treat them any differently if they were (perfectly created) robots? What does it mean to be human? <br /> <br />I also skipped over the robot torture scene in the middle of the movie. It was too disturbing, and I didn't want to watch it. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Let's start this review with a critique of the negative critiques here.  True, professional critics and the market can affect an album's success, but we're talking about a band that has existed (in the same lineup) since their high school days in the late 70's!  You're either a fan of the band, the genre, or the particular work.  There's also something to be said about the growth of the band and their fans and listeners.  For my part, I've always loved U2 since I first got into them 20 years ago, but I could not dig their 90's work, so I enjoyed the albums that I loved and anticipated the punch line to the 90's schtick.  Sho'nuf, All That You Can't Leave Behind was that moment, and 9/11 seemed to provide the climactic Moment that Bono couldn't \\"get out of.\\"   <br /> <br />We all should know by now that U2/Bono have made their music and fame a vehicle for their message.  Even the MacPhisto and Fly acts were part of a perverse statement about perversity -- it's art, okay!!??  If you have a close relationship with someone, and they do things that anger you or turn you off, are you shallow enough to break off the relationship or judge their character?  I'm one of legions who have related to U2 in a personal way (though not emotionally, I do have a life), and that is what has made them the megaband that they are!  There's none of this has-been, use-to-be-a-great-band crap that the more fickle reviewers whine about. <br /> <br />I admit, that I have to let this album grow on me, but it's a pleasant experience of familiarity -- like that friend who went wayward is ready to do his part to rekindle the sparks that made your friendship so rich and enjoyable.  I'm not particularly impressed with the Target-style, I-Pod marketing of \\"Vertigo\\", and that makes that track the hardest to like.  \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is the biggest pleasant surprise musically, with the bluesy feel -- which is ironic, because U2, at least The Edge, avoided any bluesy hints when they collaberated with B.B. King on \\"When Love Comes to Town.\\"  I have to admit the desire to know the overtly spiritual titles due to my own desire to know Yahweh more closely. <br /> <br />I don't buy the aspersions of the band's purported cartharsis, because it is just a sign of maturity.  Do people prefer 50- and 60-something relics like Aerosmith and the Stones to continue their perverted antics on stage?  I don't even favor younger bands who revel in debauchery as part of their act or persona.  I'm glad U2 is continuing to develop, and I'm speaking as an AOR-type music fan, as opposed to finicky listeners who expect instant, chart-topping gratification or whatever suits their fancy.  The good bands are the ones who do their own thing despite the whims of the masses.  U2 has proven that they're a great band, despite what I always thought was a cheesy response to their megastardom by mocking the vices and debauchery expected of huge stars.  I guess that the fans who tell me that I just didn't get the point with the 90's material should try figuring out the New Century material and grow up with the band.  And remember to enjoy your favorites -- that's what music is about, isn't it?
B0006FO9J2|5.0|Leave it up to Maiden to put out such a superb DVD loaded with old live concerts, and a documentery of how it all began. Maiden has always given their fans there moneys worth, but with this DVD they just blew me away. Other bands should take note this is how it should be done. 5+ hours of concert footage and history on the beginning of Maiden, plus many other extras, and this is only part 1. Most bands I believe shy away from this sort of thing because of how silly they may have looked back then, or maybe how amatuer they may have been in early footage as musicians, but a release like this really makes you appreciate what the band has been through to get where they're at. I paid $15.00 for this DVD . Amazon must have some sort of error since they have a release date of Dec. 28, it was actually released on Nov.23. Part 2 is supposed to have more history of the band, and also the whole \\"Live After Death\\" show which to this point has only been available on VHS. CAN'T WAIT FOR PART 2!!!UP THE IRONS!!!
B00003CWPR|1.0|The movie is slow, plodding, glacial, superficial and dull. <br />The celebrated \\"orgy\\" scene is cold and clinical at best. <br />Cruise and Kidman are both quite wooden/flat in their roles. <br />It just all goes on and on and on ad nauseum - with no point. <br />Final note: WHY WHY WHY is it the only America is forced to watch a CENSORED version of Kubrick's final film?  If the director's original intent was to show explicit SEX during the film's central set piece, WHY can't WE as Americans who are blessed with \\"FREE SPEECH\\" be allowed make up our own minds? <br />This is why the MPAA is totally OUT OF TOUCH with today's culture and sensiblities - they should definitely re-release this on DVD so at least we can finally see the \\"naughty bits\\"!
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God continue to prove they are the new force to be reckoned with in metal with their latest album.  Something I have always appreciated about this band is they never cut away from an excellent groove too soon, as was frequently the case on early Slayer albums, and this album is no exception.  Even better, they often take an already crushing riff or breakdown and one-up themselves with the next one, so there isn't any need to start tracks over because the good stuff is often still to come.  And don't forget guest solo appearances from Chris Poland and Alex Skolnick on the title track--excellent work from 80's metal heroes. <br /> <br />Essential tracks for me are \\"Hourglass\\", \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\" and \\"The Faded Line\\".  This song cycle, conveniently located in sequence on tracks 2, 3 and 4, gets me to and from work just about every day, serving as a morning wake-up call and then a tension release before getting home at night.  Previously mentioned killer riffs contained at 1:03 and in the outro from track 2; 1:41 and 2:22 through outro on track 3, and all over track 4, especially the \\"gallop\\" starting at 1:20.  Guitar tone is unbelievable, and the drums sound the way they're supposed to, especially the kick drums, which aren't mixed too high to try and show off how fast he can play.   <br /> <br />See previous review of As The Palaces Burn for thoughts about folks bagging on these guys because they aren't into the vocals.  This album is a must-have for any fan of metal.  They have improved with each album so looking forward to what comes next.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|First, this movie is hilarious.  Simply put.  You will laugh...very loudly. <br /> <br />Second, the filming of this movie is perhaps one of the best viewings of puppetry I've ever seen.  It had Bill Pope from the three Matrix movies, so you know there was a lot of talent on this.  After 5 minutes you will forget that they are puppets...how they landed many of the expressions is beyond me! <br /> <br />Third, this movie will not \\"change\\" your political leanings in any sense.  I'm a fairly liberal guy, and very much an active discusser of global warming and things that I feel there is much to think about.  But even I can laugh at the absurdity with which Hollywood and politics in general presents issues like candy being fed to the masses.  Matt and Trey do a great job of handling this, and handling the emotions we've all gone through (those of us in the USA) in the past few years. <br /> <br />Finally, I have to say this movie was a breath of fresh air in comparison to the once great \\"South Park\\", for many years my favorite show, which has become so muddled in lack of plot and heavy-handed libertarian leanings (which I generally agree with) that, with the exception of certain new episodes, has nearly driven me away.  Why can't South Park be more like Team America!?
B00005JMEW|5.0|All of my friends told me that I had to go and see this movie so I did.  I was so impressed that I had to buy it right as it came out.  The battles are amazing, the shooting is amazing.  The story cant be beat.  There is just to much to say.  If you love action movies and you don't have this in your collection you cant call it a collection.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|How long I have waited for film such as the matrix films, but I never thought that the films would take on quite so many philosophical/social/psychological/mythical/religious positions into three films and to have done it so magnificently! I still marvel that the films got made at all! But, the commentaries were highly helpful especially from the brilliant philosophers Dr. Cornell West and Ken Wilbur. Their interpretation of the films was more than I had hoped for, very insightful and enlightening; my only wish would be that they should have been given a dvd unto themselves to discuss The Matrix films! However, the critics, apart from their comments on style and camera work, I found simply humorous. I mean these guys were just clueless. The basic concepts which they should have understood in the first films they were still wondering about in the third. But even though the critics were clearly not up to the intellectual challenge of the films (as I suppose is always the case when artists are more intelligent than their critics)their comments about film, in general, were entertaining. But I did feel listening to the critics that The matrix films have become, to the critics, simply films to jeer at because they simply do not understand it. And that is unfortunate because the Matrix films are not only propelled by camera work, music, action, etc. but by the ideas that the films present, and if you cannot understand the ideas then you are missing out on the very driving force that moves the plot forward. Overall, the presentaion of the dvd collection is great. I would definately reccomend it to all the hardcore fans (and you know who you are). The Matrix trilogy is simply a work of art and even the Star Wars/Lord of the Rings films cannot compare to it intellectually. The Matrix has mangaed to show in narrative the very paths that humanity must follow or make if they want to survive the next couple of thousand of years. It is the bold blueprint of tomorrow, and of courseit is complex as the truth always is. As long as their are mindful people of high capacity there will always be the matrix films there for others to enjoy and learn from.
B0002EQ7E2|4.0|When evaluating already released music, especially music you already own (on vinyl and CD), the determining factor on whether to buy comes down to those extras.  The extras on this Grammy-laden package are OK, and certainly do not diminish the album. If you don't already own Graceland, buy this.  If you do own Graceland, buy this only if you are a completist.  What WOULD have made it more worthwhile is if it had included the  6 minute version of Boy in the Bubble that was only briefly available on 12'' vinyl, something I've NEVER seen on CD, despite all of the repackaging of Paul's works.
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|AS you can see in the video, Jimi was on fire at Berkeley, he certainly was not burnt out by touring. If he was, it doesnt show. I was never fond of the song 'Straigh Ahead' until I listened to this version, totally smokes. This was a show with a nice balance between old songs and new songs, and you can tell that Jimi is even enjoying playing some of his old hits. The best way to enjoy these shows is to go back in time and remember how a live concert was staged back then. Just a guitar, some pedals and the amps. Nothing like all the technial gizmos available today for guitar players. So you hear Hendrix tuning, getting out of tune, tunning again, having guitar problems, amps problems... It was all part of the gig back then. Do people sit around and complain how much better the Mona Lisa would be if Leonardo would have used photoshop? People taking out stars of this stellar release because of 'amp problems' and such just makes me mad. Now, why complaining about releasing only the second show? There is nothing wrong with that! This is a complete, unedited, never before released Hendrix show people! Stop complaining.  Five stars.
B000002JOH|5.0|This cd rocks!I got this when it first came out and it still rocks today.Phil.Dimebag(R.I.P. You'll be missed and remembered always!)vinnie and co. are perfect examples of what metal is and should be all about.Forget Limp Bizkit(referring to previous reviewer who called them metal(poseurs!)Pantera is real metal.This cd is powerful from start to finish.If you have never heard Vulgar,I suggest you pick this one up.Metal at its finest.Long live Dimebag!
B0000ADY9I|4.0|Dont be fooled by a previous reviewer; this is not a complete show.  All of these material has been previously released, and comes from different shows. Sometimes, the performances are edited/faded as they were originally issued. Love the packaging as with most Deluxe editions, the linear notes are not so great. I was not impressed by the sound, to my ears it sounds just the same as the earlier one disc released from Capricorn. There is so much material in the vaults from these shows, that this just doesnt cut it. Now, If you DONT own the Fillmore Concerts, this is still the best version available and the one you should get.
B00005JLXE|5.0|THEY DIDN'T JUST ADD A FEW MINUTES OF FOOTAGE. THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT, AND BETTER, CUT OF THE FILM WITH MORE STORY AND MORE INTENSITY.
0790731983|5.0|The Music and Dancing are outstanding. The 1931 Berlin Kit Kat Club comes alive. This 25th Anniversary video has an interesting documentary presentation prior to the actual film. The movie plot is only average but all of the musical aspects of the film are outstanding earning it 8 academy awards in 1972 - a real treat. One of the best musicals of all time.
B00063MBU8|1.0|not another one...dont they have enough money and time to stop ruining the music industry? i guess not...anyways, again we get one hundred percent pure crap from one of the worst bands in history. for all you kiddies who disagree, shut up because you really dont know anything, unless you can at least say one bad thing about this album, because then i see you are not as ignorant as you are precived to be. I happen to be in high school as probably many of the kids are that reviewed this, i am a sophmore, and i also happen to stay as far away from music like this as possible. you fans of this say its \\"punk\\" and the songs are \\"catchy\\" and \\"help\\" you. you obviously havent heard much. Bad Religion, Rise Against, Strung Out, NoFx, and Descendents are all \\"catchy\\" punk bands with real talent. please do yourself and everyone else a favor and spend your money on the bands that deserve it, not Simple Plan.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|I was finally able to view this movie on DVD. It only had a limited theatre release.Although it was based on a novel; It is based on real situations.I personally knew a college Instructor who was let go for failing an afro-american who did not come to classes.Being involved in relationships with the baggage of violence by exspouses are practicly a daily occurance anymore.I would hoghly reccomend this for a must rent or buy. Anthony Hopkins is a great Actor and Nicole Kidman is a good actress.This movie could have as a subtitle \\"a history of 20th/21st century america.
B00008H2LB|1.0|well i think id rather buy a rap cd.....wait nvm, they rap in thier music anyways!! yes!!! thats like, a double-crap all packaged up and ready for me to waste 13 bucks on...totally awesome
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I was really looking forward to the sequel to the Bourne Identity, but what I didn't realize was I was going to relive the \\"Blair Witch Project\\" again.  The story is good and I really enjoyed Matt Damon in the sequel, but I left the movie with a really big headache--stop moving the camera!
B00005CDNJ|5.0|One of my fondest memories of childhood is waking on Summer Saturday mornings with the sun streaming through the windows, the North Atlantic ocean crashing against the rugged coast and the music of ABBA on the stereo. This before I could even dress myself. 1976. Greatest Hits (North American Release)-VINYL. Agnetha was sitting under the autumn leaves on a park bench wearing suede boots with the toes pointed inward. The ever amorous Frida was kissing Benny. Mamma Mia, their first Canadian Hit. S.O.S. Fernando. We ate it up and wore out the grooves. Next up, CBC Television Special -ABBA's Canadian TV Debut featuring Frida and Agnetha singing \\"Mamma Mia\\" in front of a haystack on a Farm outside Edmonton, Alberta. Low budget TV. LOL! (I was a child and I remember everything in vivid detail!) 1976-Knowing Me, Knowing You. Early Summer Evenings. I can hear the Jukebox at the Local Pool Hall from the yard \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You; There is Nothing We Can Do\\" and the equally catchy B Side \\"Happy Hawaii\\" (one of my all time favorites, an early version of the inferior \\"Why Did It Have to Be Me\\" included on \\"Arrival\\"). 1977-The Album. 8 TRACK - Big Mistake. Told Sister, no more 8 Tracks! (\\"Oh and there's another 8 Track at the store with ABBA in a helicopter. What's that? Don't get it, it's probably 2 Years old!!!\\" LOL!) \\"Take a Chance On Me\\", \\"The Name of the Game\\", and another of my all time favorites \\"Move On\\" (later used in Canada for \\"Halo\\" Shampoo Commercials). ABBA had taken over the world - or so it seemed. 1978 Dryspell. And then they came back. New York City. Winter 1979. Concert for Unicef, United Nations General Assembly. CBC TV. A Wednesday Night. 10:30 PM North Atlantic time. Waiting for an eternity. Suffering through CBC schlock like \\"Music Camera\\" and \\"The Nature of Things\\". Way, way past my bedtime. Sick with the flu. Refusing to go to bed. Fighting with Mother. Swearing at the CBC (in my head). And then it started. Rod Stewart. Bee Gees. Donna Summer. OliviaNewton John. And Gilda Radner introducing \\"Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn, Ani-Frid or to put it another way, \\"ABBA\\"\\". Agnetha and Frida in skin tight matching catsuits. Pre-pubescent. And frankly confused by the fuss. And the world heard the first chords of \\"Chiquitita\\" LIVE. Flashforward. Alexandra Disco in Stockholm, Sweden. Cover Shot for \\"Voulez Vous\\". Back to VINYL - 8 TRACK is for the birds! Older sister (Much older. LOL!) getting ready to go out with \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" blaring in the background. And a favorite non-Single \\"As Good as New\\". CJON Radio. Playing B Side to \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Lovelight\\" (between Bette Midler \\"The Rose\\" and Donna Summer \\"Hot Stuff\\") Sent us scrambling to find out what Album that song was from (the song surfaced in 1997 when ABBA's Canadian Label Remastered all of their CDs and included all of the B Sides as Bonus Tracks on the Remastered CDs). CBC Special from Switzerland Ski resort with Canadian Disco Duo -\\"The Raes\\" (\\"Que Sera, Sera\\", \\"Don't Turn Around\\") and their special guests, \\"ABBA\\". ABBA performs Chiquitita in the snow. And then it happens. ABBA comes to Canada! 1979 North American Tour kicks of in Edmonton, Alberta. Now in Toronto. And coming further East and ever closer...MONTREAL! The Forum. Agnetha performs with a Fever. And South they go and forever out of reach. Christmas 1979. ABBA - Greatest Hits, Vol. II. \\"Rock Me\\"? Where did that come from? \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\" another favorite. \\"Dancing Queen\\"? - missed that one the first time around. Yes, REALLY! Maybe that 8 TRACK with ABBA in a helicopter on the cover was worth checking out after all! LOL! 1980. American Top 40 with Casey Casem. \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" become ABBA's last U.S. Top Ten. \\"Our Last Summer\\", \\"The Way Old Friends Do\\". 1981. \\"The Visitors\\". \\"One of Us\\" and \\"When All is Said and Done\\" and a chapter closes in Music History and in one life. <br />And the world moves on. Flashforward. 2004. Dutch born, New York City resident and Recording Artist AMBER releases \\"My Kind of World\\". Sounds nothing like ABBA. But this person who loves ABBA, loves this CD and maybe you will too! Check it out: AMBER - MY Kind of World! <br /> <br />  <br />
0345452577|3.0|Jonathan Kellerman, a hit-or-miss writer with more misses in recent years, has something in the middle with the Conspiracy Club, a rather average thriller that takes a break from series character Alex Delaware to present a similar character named Jeremy Carrier.  Carrier is a psychologist who is recovering from the murder of his girlfriend, a death that is more devastating because he is a suspect in the crime.  He is drawn out of his funk by two people:  Arthur Chess, a retired pathologist whose mysterious actions start to point Carrier towards the real killer, and Angela Rios, a doctor who he starts dating.<br /><br />As if working a puzzle, Carrier is presented piece by piece the solution to the murder.  This is not a whodunit:  there is no way the reader can figure out the killer before Carrier does.  In addition, the reason behind Carrier's manipulation is not that plausible; there are easier ways to do things that seem to escape the characters.<br /><br />I have said for a while that Alex Delaware has become more and more of a nondescript, boring character (although there has been a little improvement in recent books).  Carrier seems to be Kellerman's attempt to recreate Delaware under a new name.  There is even a cop in this story named Doresh who has a similar gruffness to Milo Sturgis, although Doresh and Carrier have a more antagonistic relationship.<br /><br />The last time Kellerman did a non-Delaware novel, he excelled with Billy Straight; this effort is okay, but not as successful.  Although it does have its problems, this book is a generally entertaining read, neither exceptionally good or bad.  It is strictly a three star work, of more interest to Kellerman fans than to mystery fans in general.
B000696PWC|5.0|I have followed Kylie since the beginning.  She has a unique vision and anyone who has seen her performances or music videos will know how creative she is.  To all Americans from an Irish fan. What is wrong with you people? Kylie is a better artist than Madonna these days. Here in Europe she has outsold her.  From I should be so lucky to I Believe in you this is an excellent collection.  A few omissions were very wrongly made like 95's Where is the feeling and 97's Some Kind Of Bliss. The top five on disc one are. What do I have to do, Better the devil you know, Shocked, Got to be certain and Tears on my pillow. On disc two. Can't get you out of my head, I believe in you, spinning around, slow, and confide in me.  This is genious. If you are unfamiliar with Kylie and want to start buy this. People on four continents can't be wrong.  America catch up. Kylie is here to stay!
B000056VJ7|5.0|Honestly, the first time I truly listened to Meatloaf was on VH1. I was watching a movie based on him and some of the songs I heard was excellent and I remembered when my brother gave me a Meatloaf CD. I searched around and, wouldn't you know it, I came across his debut album. <br /> <br />After listening to a few tracks, I knew I was on to something special. I have honestly never heard a rock album quite like this before. It was sarcastic, sad, and has got THE best rock music I've heard to this day. You can not name another rock artist that I like more than Meatloaf. <br /> <br />What is really special about this album is the years it can last. I mean, when I first listen to it, I absolutely loved it. However, after years of listening, I begin to notice things that I didn't before. For example, there is A LOT of sexual connotations. There's also two levels to all of these songs, a sincere level and an insincere level. <br /> <br />I mean, really, just listen to some of the lyrics closely. Here is a line from Paradise By The Dashboard Light. <br /> <br />\\"Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night, I can see paradise by the dashboard light.\\" <br /> <br />I didn't notice myself for a long time, but then I realized it. \\"I can see paradise by the dashboard light\\"? Now ask yourself, what do you normally see by the dashboard light? This makes it even worse when you include the fact that a woman is singing this song with Meatloaf. <br /> <br />Honestly, you can listen to this album on so many levels, and like many have said, it has excellent music! I highly HIGHLY recommend this album to all rock fans!
0060573775|5.0|I've always loved this book, and except for the author's narration, could never imagine who might pull off a convincing reading. The George Roy Hill movie had Glenn Gould's music and good intentions, but was God-awful.  Then, as now, the storyteller's voice needs to be a talent that can transcend time and shift with the narrator's ever-changing age,, and that's what Ethan Hawkes' sardonic, sensitive reading achieves. <br /> <br />It takes a few minutes for Hawke's approach to grow on you, but once Vonnegut opens Billy Pilgrim's story and begins to expostulate on war and the horrors of war, on time and relativity on Tralfamadore, Hawke's voice merges perfectly with the narrative.  <br /> <br />This is a good deal for an unabridged recording, and while the disks are cheaply packed in paper slots, none were scratched or marred.  The recording was crisp and clean with a flat, natural balance to the voice.  Take this one with you for the ride.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|there is no freakin way to get all the best together at the same time. but this comes VERY close. Tha's awl fowkes!!!
0803729227|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is a classic tale with a friendship reminiscent of Wilbur and Charlotte, though expressed in much fewer words. This is an exceptional book with beautiful illustrations and a wonderful story - perfect for all ages. The adventurous spirit and courage of our tiny hero is remarkable, proving that even the smallest of us can make a huge difference in the world. This is truly a prize book for my collection, and one I will enjoy reading again and again for years to come.    J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles
0767817729|5.0|The reason (and I dare anyone to dispute me on this) that this movie did not receive more fanfare is because politically correct WIMPS refused to give it the attention it deserves. Due to the brutal way in which Quinn's character treats his wife upon learning of her infidelity, the politically correct critics and moviegoers alike simply did not want to be perceived, in their idiotic minds, as being pro-violence towards women. \\"If we say this is a good movie, then we would be saying that violence towards women must be good too, right?\\"  <br /> <br />Lunacy. <br /> <br />But this IS a good movie and a good DVD: Great sound, excellent quality picture, well acted, interesting characters and great locations.
0803723865|5.0|What an incredible magical combination of author and artist, and what an outstanding set of books this collaboration has produced.  The Gruffalo is an amazing tale that reminds me of many stories I read as a child:  It has a wonderful combination of characters like The Little Red Hen, a sequence of events similar to The Old Woman and Her Pig, and the magical elements of many fairy tales.  I believe Julia Donaldson is every bit as talented in creating rhyme as the great Dr. Seuss.  The language has exceptional flow and makes this a fantastic read aloud book.  Both children and adults will marvel at the ingenuity of our tiny hero on his journey, as well as his charm.  The artwork is brilliant, and the story is superb.  I recommend The Gruffalo for everyone who loves great stories and beautiful children's books. <br /> <br />J.H. Sweet, author of The Fairy Chronicles
068987474X|5.0|Let me tell you, single or not this book is fantastic.  While I was reading it even my boyfriend was TRIPPIN!  He kept asking if he was ok and worried he would get the axe.  I swear I wish I had this book 10 years ago.  It's so funny and informative.  Greg is the man!  I have already passed it to the girls at work and buying more for my single girlfriends. It points out why settle and how we are above putting up with the crap men shovel out so freely.  It also tells W H Y hard to get is such a hard yet great method.
0060989157|5.0|I've always been a Crue fan since I was 10,but lost interest after they fired Vince,or when he quit,whatever. But if you want to read about a decadent band that really rocks,pick this book. It's brutally honest. The chapter that got the most of me is when Vince talked about his daughter's death,since I am a father of a little girl as well. Very poignant stuff!!! I just wish that the original KISS memebers put out a book like this.
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary Of A Madman along with it's predecessor \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" are genre defining records that stand the test of time some 23 years after their original releases. Of note: <br /> <br />1] Randy was quoted as not being entirely happy with this record because they were rushed out of the studio to tour America. He felt some giuitar parts were unfinished or not quite where he wanted them to be. <br /> <br />2] In spite of this, I feel that one of Randy's best pieces of work is the outro of the song \\"Tonight\\". While the song itself is a mildly entertaining cut, the work Randy does on the end of it is simply amazing. Put the 'phones on and turn up the volume as the song fades and be amazed and left wanting for the tape to never end... <br /> <br />3] Although it was recorded almost immediately after \\"Blizzard\\", to me the production sounds a little glossier, although I can't put a finger on why. Probably the mix. <br /> <br />4] As others have stated, buy the '95 remasters or the original issue - used. The recent versions re-released by Sharon with Trujillo and Bordin replacing Daisley and Kerslake are nothing short of a greed driven attempt to rewrite history. The insult of this act is pure sacrilege.
0792165020|1.0|Don't buy this movie.  If you've seen it, than remedy that problem by seeing Plein Soleil: Purple Noon (1960, directed by Rene Clement), the original Talented Mr. Ripley movie, and reading the book by Patricia Highsmith.    First of all, this version undermines the greatness of the original film.  Just on an asthetic (sp?) note, Seeing Matt Damon in the role of Tom after seeing Alain Delon in the same role is tragic.  Jude Law in the role of Dickie doesn't live up to Maurice Ronet's acting.  Law's Dickie is not nearly as commanding a personality.  He has no edge.  He isn't distant enough with Marge.  Where Ronet seems to be playing a cruel game with Marge, Law seems to actually love her.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to kill Law, wheras Ronet comes off as a complete arse.  As for Tom, Damon's Tom is more needy and soppy than Delon's Tom.  Then there's still the fact that the likes of Damon was cast in a role once graced by a gorgeous actor.  Clement's Purple Noon is supensful and the cinematography is beautiful.  I found myself fast-forwarding through this version.      Secondly, the director of this version doesn't just not stick to the book, he destroys the book.  Highsmith's novel is excellent and it pains me to think that some people have seen this movie and think it's actually a representation of what they'd get if they read the book.  Clement's version doesn't exactly follow the book word for word either, but it sticks to the story (except for the end, keep in mind that this film was made in 1960)pretty well.  It's still a wonderful movie.  I usually hate film adaptations of books I like...  This director, Minghella, adds way too many things and scenes that have nothing to do with the original story or the original characters.  I also hate the way he's changed the characters, especially Tom.  To begin with, the Tom in this movie is a pianist who apparently went to Princeton... Princeton?  A pianist?!  This does not seem the sort of man you'd find in seedy bars, trying to avoid cops or the type who'd make money by forging signitures or defrauding the government.  The real Tom wouldn't bring Shakespeare with him to Italy either.  Minghella's Tom is too distinguished and cultured.  Also, I remember in one scene, Tom is hesitant to spend Greenleaf's money.  The \\"real\\" Tom wouldn't care.  The real Tom would love spending someone else's money!  The worst thing about this Tom is that he seems to develop a sort of love for Dickie.  When he kills Dickie, it's because they've gotten into a fight.  It seems like a crime of passion, not a premeditated act of murder for money.      Overall, this movie is a horrible remake of a fantastic book and a great movie.  I have to admit that I gave up after a while out of disgust, but I saw what I needed to see in order to write this review.      Please, don't waste your time.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I would have to say this is just another piece of Hayao Miyazakis great work, and it's interesting seing this story from the main charector being a pig, from how he made Spirited Away look with those pigs.I'm sure you will like this movie, and knowing, Hayao Miyazaki never lets you down when it comes to great movies.
B0006399FS|1.0|After U2's last stellar effort, I was expecting more from one of the world's last great rock and roll bands.  I have and still throughly enjoy the bands previous efforts but was very disappointed after multiple listenings to this album.  I am sure Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry still have a lot to say, but they did not do it on this album.  My advice to U2 fans - if you do not have previous U2 album's - spend your money there not on this effort.  Hopefully the band's next collection of material will be back to their previous standard.
B000001DYY|5.0|With the recent Tears for Fears tour, a lot of people are going to revisit the incredible talent of Roland Orzabal.  I only thought I was a fan until I started checking out the backlog of what I had missed.  And Elemental is the pinnacle.  The layered beauty of the sounds, is only surpassed by the amazing power and suppleness of his voice.(Check out 'Cold'. How does one get so many sounds out of the 2 syllable word guru?) The 3 opening cuts are powerhouses, Elemental, Cold, and (the deservedly well known) Break it Down Again. Everything else on this CD is equally worthy. Do yourself a favor. Buy this. Its one of those soul soaring creations that makes it feel good to be alive.
0345457684|5.0|Snow Crash (another more famous \\"cyberpunk\\" novel) is like a kids cartoon compared to this gritty, sexual and violent novel. R. M. sets the world, the year 25K, alive. Don't look for pandering descriptions of the world of tomorrow though. The future unravels slowly with only the bits necessary for the story shown. The plot on the other hand doesn't unravel as much as bowl you over. This is one of the only books I've read, other than ghost stories, which have the main character die within the first three pages. The gunfight on the first pages sets the pace for the rest of the book and Morgan's descriptions are amazing. <br /> <br />This is not for anyone who is easily offended by violence or sexual situations. But don't let that hinder your enjoyment of the novel, the V and S fit perfectly into the world Morgan has crafted. Look at our tendencies as a society now and you may see our future printed in this book. <br /> <br />If you do decide to read Altered Carbon it would be my advice to remember all of the names referenced early on. My memory is bad to say the least and I wish someone had warned me to pay closer attention. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves great sci-fi with a believable cohesive future and tons of action (oh yeah, the mystery is pretty slick to). <br /> <br />PS. Don't get me wrong, I loved Snow Crash too.
B000002U82|5.0|For the longest time, I refused to buy into the hype and legend that surrounded this 1973 LP. Too much was written about it, the songs and their meanings were speculated and debated on by everyone I knew and the fact that it stayed on the Billboard Charts for a million years made it easy for me to dismiss it, after all, what do the masses know? But on Thanksgiving Day, just two weeks ago, I finally picked up a copy and gave it a listen, hmmm...relaxing, nice arrangements, excellent playing and great vocal harmonies throughout, not bad! \\"Us & Them\\" is my current fave and I now understand why so many millions have fallen under the spell of \\"Darkside....\\". The sounds and textures truly envelope and soothe you, creating a warm, calming effect that lingers long after the album ends. Roger Waters is one of the most underrated bassists in rock and his playing here ties everything together, truly unifying the disparate parts of this work. I'm a new convert.
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|The box set is incomplete through and through. I would've thought that since Sony came out with it, that it would include all of his hits from his early days in Jackson 5 all the way up to now; it doesn't. It doesn't include all of the duets he did as part of the Jackson 5 and solo such as \\"Say Say Say\\", \\"Muscles\\" which he wrote and \\"Somebody is Watching Me\\" which he also co wrote. It doesn't include more of the Jackson 5 hits which is pretty much disrespectful since he had more hits in that group than solo, it briefly skims over the Jacksons hits which is a bit of a save since the Jacksons was just a stopping point for Michael. Its good that they have all that unreleased stuff but at this point in time, it doesnt matter unless Epic/Sony is telling us something that we don't know; Is Michael's career over?. It doesn't include \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Lady of My Life\\" which are important soul tracks. It doesn't include \\"Scream\\" the only duet he did with Janet which also makes the Box fall short. It doesn't include any of the songs in their Moonwalker versions which is another issue since we all grew up watching that. It would've been a complete box if they also gave us more that we remember from Michael as well as the unreleased material which really was used to fill in the discs in my opinion. Michael deserves way more respect than that when it comes to a box set.
B00005JLWN|5.0|My mate let me borrow this and it's sat on my DVD player for weeks. I have to say that like almost everyone else i thought it'd be a Matrix rip-off. It's nothing like the Matrix. <br /> <br />Man has survived WWIII...just, and society comes up with a plan that emotions are the cause of man's downfall. If we had no emotions, there would be not jealousy, no greed, no anger, hate or war. So, the 'Father' (kinda goverment thing) brainwashes what's left of mankind into taking a drug to prevent all emotion and ultimately prevent another war. <br /> <br />Despite this 'perfect' hate free society, it's actually one messed up place. There are considerable parallels between the city Equilibrium and the Third Reich...the state flag looking almost like an inverted Swastika. The use of brute force to promote this 'perfect' society are at times sickening. I honestly thought I was going to throw up when Mary O'Brian was sentanced to combustion for resising the drug. But then...cremation scares the hell out of me anyway so being cremated alive.... *whimper* :/ <br /> <br />The cast are excellent in their roles, in particular the lovely Angus Mcfadgen(Braveheart's Robert the Bruce...where's your Scottish accent gone mate?!) Like everyone mentions the gun kata kicks some serious ass.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a fantastic film. I'm not going to decide whether it's better than the Matrix or not because they're nothing like each other. Get this film...it'll make you realise that a society with murder may just be slightly better than a controlled society without.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Nick cave is perhaps the most brilliant rock poet of our day. I was less fond of Nocturama than previous releases mainly due to relatively weak lyrics. These two discs are as lyrically deep as they are musically. Nick is really a modern straggler from the romantic period. His words look as beautiful on paper as they do in song. The sound of these 2 cds is very mature...not to mean it's not still raw and experimental at times. Two very different albums in one package. Abattoir Blues simply rocks! This is powerful stuff. The only song I can't really digest is \\"Breathless\\". It rather amused me the first time I heard it, but now it's grown to be more of an annoyance. I don't think the reggae tinge works. That's just me though. I've seen others point to \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" and \\"The Fable of the Brown Ape\\" as weak points and those are favorites of mine. But everyone seems to agree that it's a damn fine release. Cheers Nick!
B000007492|5.0|CONSUMER ALERT: A prior review by Terrence J Reardon claimed that this compilatation has the full length versions of the songs. THIS IS NOT TRUE ON ALL VERSIONS, that is there are at least TWO BEST OF's on the market. I purchase a copy from E-Shops on Amazon and received a South American printing. The tracks are the same as on the the 25th Anniversary classics edition. Goodbye Stranger still has a whole verse missing and the outro is dramaticly shorter. Same is true on Take The Long Way Home as the end fades out much too soon. All the other tracks run the same time as the albums they originally appear on. Only the US printing seems to have the full length versions. Both printings include includes School, a good track but you wouldn't miss it. If you don't have any Supertramp recordings, then you should defenitely get this (you really should have \\"Crime Of The Century\\" and \\"Breakfast In America\\" anyway as they should be heard in their entirety, truly classics). If you have the 25th A&M Anniversary copy of Supertramp Classic, then it's worth replacing. Just make sure you're getting the right version of  The Very Best Of Supertramp. If the timing on \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" is under five minutes, then it's the bad one (It should run 5:40). \\"Cannonball\\" should be over 7 minutes too.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|First of all, I must qualify this review: I am a hardcore fan of Bruce Springsteen's. I find quality in almost all of his work, yes, even in albums like 'Human Touch' and 'Lucky Town.'  That said, I consider myself to have the ability for objectivity when it comes to the Boss and his music. <br /> <br />'The Essential Bruce Springsteen' spans the Boss' entire musical career.  It does a fairly decent job.  All of the songs on the CD have merit of some kind.  To qualify this collection as an \\"essential\\" collection is just terribly misleading, however. <br /> <br />When I think of an \\"essential\\" collection, I think of a collection of songs by an artist that will attract the casual fans of said artist.  In my opinion, an \\"essential\\" collection should introduce the casual fan to the songs that longtime fans immediately associate with the artist.  This CD does that, but only to an extent. <br /> <br />First, let's start with the most glaring absence on the CD, a song that, since it didn't make it onto the 'Greatest Hits' CD, I thought for certain would be on the Essential Collection: 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out.'  'Tenth Avenue' is a song that most long-time fans almost immediately associate with Bruce and the E-Street band.  This should have absolutely been on this collection. <br /> <br />Other songs missing from the early years that should've been on this set include \\"It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City.\\"  I would've put it in the place of \\"For You,\\" off the same original album.  While \\"For You\\" is an enjoyable song, \\"Saint\\" is mroe representative of Springsteen's early struggles in the business. <br /> <br />To be quite honest, I don't really consider much of Disc 3 as essential.  I love the hard-to-find outtakes and alternative versions, but out of Disc 3, the only one that should be considered \\"essential\\" is Springsteen's version of 'Trapped.'  Other songs like \\"From Small Things\\" and \\"Viva Las Vages\\" probably should've been a part of the 4-Disc 'Tracks' released backin 1998. <br /> <br />Other truly essential songs that should've been part of this collection are: \\"E-Street Shuffle,\\" \\"Incident on 57th Street,\\" \\"Jungleland,\\" \\"Racing in the Streets,\\" \\"Ramrod,\\" \\"Cadillac Ranch,\\" \\"Two Hearts,\\" \\"Reason to Believe,\\" \\"I'm Going Down,\\" \\"My Hometwon,\\" \\"Walk Like a Man.\\" <br /> <br />While one of the best albums of the post 9-11 days, I'm not sure that songs from 'The Rising' belong on this collection.  If it does, then I think you should replace \\"Mary's Place\\" with \\"My City of Ruins.\\" <br /> <br />Obviously, this is a matter of personal taste.  And generally-speaking, the songs on this collection are all good songs.  The title, as I mentioned, is misleading. The songs on Disc 3 are hardly essential.  \\"From Small Things\\" and \\"Held Up\\" are fun sings, but essential?  Not nearly as much as \\"Jungleland\\" or \\"Racing in the Street.\\" <br /> <br />A great collection of (mostly) great songs.  \\"Essential?\\"  I'm not too sure.
B000002JR8|5.0|Yeah, as everyone knows, Dimebag Darrell's life was taken abruptly last night by some crazy fan that blamed him for breaking up Pantera (or so I've read). Damageplan were just warming up when this gunman leaped up on stage and took Darrell's life (and the lives of several other fans). Right now, I am at a loss of words for what I've just heard this morning. <br /> <br />\\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott was truly one of the greatest guitarists the metal world has ever seen and heard. He pulled off riffs like no other guitarist I've heard. And it was this album that truly made me a metal fan. <br /> <br />Sure, Slipknot got me into \\"nu\\" metal, but it was Pantera's \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" that opened my eyes to a better view of heavy metal. I still remember when I first listened to this album. I heard it back in my freshman years of high school. And, yeah, Slipknot were my favorite... but not until a friend loaned me a copy of this album. I put it in my CD player... and I was just in complete awe. \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" was the harshest song I've heard (at the time). The music was loud and the band played at a fast pace. The lyric \\"F*** you and your college dream! Fact is we're stronger than all!\\" really stuck into my head. Phil sings angrily about certain economical issues like drugs. And Dimebag comes in with an eerie guitar sound. \\"Hail! King! The new... king! Stronger than all!\\" Phil immediately growls when Dimebag finishes his haunting solo. Yes... hail Pantera. Hearing that line immediately made me a newcoming fan of Pantera. <br /> <br />Just hearing that first track catipulted me into the real heavy metal world. No nu-metal like Slipknot. The absolute harshness and darkness that heavy metal is. This album is downright brutal only to still be bested by \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\" It sure packs a hell lot of great and kickass heavy metal music. Phil growls unlike anything before with lyrics that give a glimpse of the American Southwest and being born again with snake's eyes. Rex on the bass is still kick ass, sounding like a reincarnated Cliff Burton. And Vinnie Paul (Darrell's brother) on the drums is equally as good as John Bonham (former Led Zeppelin drummer that passed on). Pantera truly were a great heavy metal band, and I always considered them to be the best. <br /> <br />And Dimebag played the guitar like no other that I've heard... at the time. He played fast and relentlessly. His guitar screeched to the point where you feel as if you're going to go deaf or make your ears bleed. And his solos are simply amazing as each song progressed. He is no Hendrix, Page, or Kirk Hammett... no he isn't any of them. He's better than all of them. That's what I think. That's what I've always thought ever since first I heard this album and discovered Pantera. <br /> <br />Dimebag Darrell will truly be missed by this fan, as well as his millions of other headbanging fanatics. From Pantera to Damageplan, Dimebag Darrell still kicked ass on the guitar. It's so sad that he left this world so soon. But nevertheless, his music will continue to live on for the years to come. His legacy will never be forgotten. <br /> <br />Because my friend, \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott will always be stronger than all. <br /> <br />May he rest in peace and my condolences go out to the familes of the victims who's lives were taken abruptly last night.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|My favorite author is Robert Ludlum, and I especially loved his Jason Bourne books.  I was looking forward to this movie, but after seeing it, I wondered why didn't they stick to the story line?  The books are great.  The movie was a disappointment because it had nothing to do with the book.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie has an unfair advantage over most movies: it's British. For some reason, the British are just a whole lot funnier than us Americans. One might argue that comparing the difference between British and American humor is like comparing apples and oranges. I say, there isn't much difference between apples and oranges: they are both fruit, they are both sort of spherical, they are both sweet, they both make a popular juice, hell, they both grow on trees! One is definitely superior to the other. Okay, I am digressing from the point...    Shaun of the Dead is a fine example of dead-on (excuse the pun) British wit. Both main characters are too blitheringly British to take notice of what is going on around them, and when they do realize, they aren't all that affected by the situation.     A fair amount of people didn't find this movie \\"laugh out loud\\" funny. Sure, there is a lack of farting jokes, but then again, I never found those very funny anyway. Shaun of the Dead is more situation funny. And some jokes are just flat out esoteric. For example, when Ed was tossing records at the zombies he asked Shaun if he could throw the Stone Roses album. Shaun said no. Ed then said \\"It's Second Coming.\\" To get this joke you have to know that the Stone Roses are only respected for their first album and NOT their second, Second Coming, which is collectively agreed as a pretty lousy album (though Shaun sadly admitted to liking it - which is also funny). Most Americans aren't that fimiliar with the Stone Roses, so this joke would go right over their head. Other jokes are just inherently British, they rely entirely on the anti-dramatic execution that made shows/movies like Monty Python, Mr. Bean, The Office and others so very popular and gut-wrenchingly funny.    Do not watch this film as a zombie film. Yes, it does have zombies in it, but it is really just another great British comedy...with a whole lot of gore.
0688163173|2.0|I'm not reviewing Dennis Lehane's book.  I'm reviewing Robert Hazelwood's review of Dennis Lehane's book.  His is the best and funniest I've read by any of your customers - or by any of your editors for that matter.  This is exactly how I felt about this book but Robert said it so much more cleverly than I could.
B000669GAI|4.0|Bravo,Bravo!Pearl Jam is my all time favorite rock band,there is simply no other band that is as talented as this Seattle quintet!I must say im pretty impressed with the track listing,im surprised that songs like \\"once\\" and \\"i got id\\"were included..they are two of my favorites.There are still several hits missing and the big question is where the heck is \\"Crazy Mary\\",the one song im sure all us die hard Pearl Jam fans adore!I dont understand why \\"Last Kiss\\" made it ,it's just a friggin cover...I cant stand that song!!!Anyways the single \\"State of Love and Trust\\"is ok,however they are nothing special,but significant since it was the first single put out by the band.Personally I would've left off \\"Man of the Hour\\" and \\"Breath\\"...they are both boring to me and I just dont see why they are on here(thumbs down)for Sony doing that!...What do the words \\"greatest hits\\"really mean?...Some commercial,some not is what it should stand for.They shoudld've taken the time to add a few non mainstream tracks,the really good ones like \\"rats\\",\\"faithfull\\", and \\"smile\\".Hell with a great band like PJ you could even get away with putting out a killer 3 CD Greatest Hits with no problem,because they have soooo many awesome songs it's hard to cram all their hits on 2 cd's.I wonder what the future has in store for the band since their contract is up with Sony? Here's some songs I would've loved to have seen make the cut <br /> <br />Ten-why go,oceans,porch,garden <br /> <br />VS.-rats,leash,glorified g <br /> <br />Vitalogy-tremor christ,satan's bed <br /> <br />No Code-mankind,smile,in my tree,present tense <br /> <br />Yield-faithfull,in hiding <br /> <br />Binaural-insignificance,thin air <br /> <br />Riot Act-love boat captain,you are,get right <br /> <br />Other-crazy mary <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />am i leaving any out??? <br /> <br />All in all one of the better greatest hits collections in a long time!!!It's in the high 4 stars...nearly a 5 by all means!
B00012QKSI|4.0|Love actually, is one of the funniest romantic comedy's i ever seen. But the funniest thing that stuck out the most in the movie was the song 'Christmas  Is All Around.' I never laughed so hard at a song. This is the only track i like, and listen to, so to me the soundtrack is worth the buy.
068987474X|1.0|Ok, men are simple. Mixed messages mean that \\"they're just not that into you.\\" Ok, 176 pages later... the same thing. Read the product description. Save yourself some time. Do or read something productive (maybe then men will actually be into you and you won't need a book to decipher your inadequacy and failure) It sums it up nicely. Or, God forbid, watch the \\"Sex in the City\\" Episode. Cary Bradshaw probably types it on her laptop in the form of a horribly trite and insipid rhetorical question. She's a writer!!! It's cute... Buy this book with The Da Vinci Code and The South Beach Diet if you are completely retarded.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan from the start, and I appreciate pretty much all of their music. However, the main reason I'm writing this is to set things straight from the clueless people who claim Green Day has sold out, or lost the spark.    Let me start by saying... uh, no. Haha, really though, think about it, let's say, for example, that each member of the band recieved a single dollar for each album sold out of the total of 11 million Dookie albums sold. That's 11 million EACH, now add merchandise, tours, music videos, two compilation albums, and finally FIVE other original albums (not including this one). Who on earth would need more money than that? C'mon, get real, sell out? My foot.    As for the 'lost' spark, I'm afraid to say that those who accuse Green Day of this are the ones that are lost... in the past. Dookie, without a doubt, was a phenomenon. It was as revolutionary and inspiring to the punk scene as Nirvana's Nevermind was to the grunge scene. But those songs came from young men, songs about teenage-angst, like smoking up, whacking off, utter boredom, inside jokes, etc. These guys are now all well into adulthood and parenthood, so is it impossible to conceive the fact that their morals and views on life have matured along with them? Green Day have changed, they have gone from artists to composers, and by that I mean that they aren't the only ones playing on the album. Apart from the usual 3 piece set of the guitar, bass, and drums, you have a piano, lead guitar, saxophone, additional vocals... to name a few. Dookie, Dookie, Dookie... it's over, that was 10 years ago! How could anybody expect a band not to change over a 10 year period? Green Day have done something truly different, their album actually MAKES a statement, and they are not affraid to show their concern with current issues. Like a fine wine, Green Day developed a richer and more mature taste over time. They have blossomed as a band, and we should appreciate this album and the effort ittook to create it.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Live Aid on TV back when it occurred (had taped it on BETA then- how times have changed) It is a good transfer to DVD. I miss Power Station and Led Zepplin not being on, but if you are a fan of 80's music like me, you should enjoy this. My fave track is the Paul Young/Alison Moyet duet \\"That's the Way Love Is\\" Hope this is helpful.
077106506X|5.0|When recommending a book to someone, I try to keep in mind what theyre interested in.  The joy of Munros books is that you dont have to do thistheyre really about any and everything and the writing is so accessible and intelligent that anyone can pick these up and like them.  If you enjoyed Jackson McCraes THE CHILDRENS CORNER or David Eggers HOW WE ARE HUNGRY, then youll love Munros latest collection.  Of all the stories in this staggering little bunch, Powers was, for me, the most riveting.  Dealing with a young woman who has the ability to read the future, her escapades start the ball rolling (not always in a good direction) for family and friends.  Munro is a Canadian, and one might suspect she would be somewhat limited in her material.  Not so.  These stories are filled with insight that cuts across geography and time.  If you enjoy good writing that takes its time to work its charm on you, then I strongly suggest you try RUNAWAY.  If you havent read the Eggers or the McCrae yet, those are musts.  With the short story form coming back into vogue, these are all winners.
6305308659|5.0|This is it. This is what filmmaking is all about. Make a movie ABOUT filmmaking. This is the premise behind \\"Pleasantville\\", a very pleasant movie focusing on a very pleasant town with very pleasant people. Reese Witherspoon and the excellent Tobey Maguire are brother and sister. They are thrown into the real-life world of their favorite TV show, and they are the stars! In this town, everyone is happy, the temperature is always 72 degrees, and the basketball team can't miss a shot! That is, until the two teens get wrapped up in this strange world, where very unpleasant things begin to happen. Most notably, some of the town gains color, and so do some of the people. In a hint of real-life racism, the \\"colored\\" people are discriminated against and are hated because of their superiority. People begin to have affairs, and the town becomes a mess. A terrific cast and a very \\"pleasant\\" film, this wonderful achievement is not to be missed!
B0006284JQ|5.0|The girl has done it again!!! Britney enlightens people with her Greatest Hits album, &quot;My Prerogative.&quot; This album truly shows how Britney has grown from the age of 17 with her 1999 hit, &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; to a beautiful, sophisticated, young woman with her latest, &quot;My Prerogative&quot;. You can definitely see Britneys growth and transition from a girl to a woman, and if someone can do that, then they are what I like to call a REAL ARTIST! She has captured our hearts, attention, and she strived to what she became to be known as the biggest female artist in the world. Out of all the singles on this album, some that are a highlight include: Overprotected, Lucky, Slave 4 U, Toxic, Me Against The Music, Stronger and Outrageous. As you can see, it is mostly the upbeat tempos that attract people. Other unreleased songs that made it to this album include: &quot;Just Begun (Having My Fun)&quot; which is honestly a fun song to listen to, especially when you are driving and can jam to it. &quot;Do Something&quot; is another interesting song from Britney, something you wouldn't expect. You can see that her direction has changed. Britney's greatest hits is to allow people to realize that she is going to take some time off away from the business and fulfill her role as being a wife and the woman that she is, that she doesn't get to be when in the public eye 24/7. If you ask me, she has worked hard enough, she earned a break. This definitely makes a great album and a great gift to someone you know! For a limited time, the limited edition cd includes special remixes to &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; (One of my favourites), &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;Everytime&quot; and many more.
B000002UAU|5.0|I hope I can put into words what this album meant to me, and probably to others that hasn't been explained.  This album became way more than the sum of its parts.  It started as an idea by Paul McCartney.  The Beatles had a lot of material that they weren't sure would be accepted by their fans.  So Paul's idea was to present the entire album as if it was a show being put on by an alter-ego band, i.e. Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  When you listen to the individual songs, they are all brilliant gems, (well, I could live without \\"She's Leaving Home\\").  But they all fit together in an explosive way that encapsulated the times they were in, in a way even the Beatles seem to have no knowledge of what they had done.  Yes, the songs SOUND peppy, lighthearted, trippy, etc.  But underneath it all is a layer of nihilism and hopelessness, that was a reflection of the hippie revolution that was going south, the increasingly bad drug trips, the endless Vietnam War, the breakdown of families, worldwide revolutions and assasinations.  Side One begins with \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" which all sing and set the stage, getting the audience ready for a fabulous, upbeat show and introduces the band in a lively rocked-out manner. \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" gives Ringo a chance and introduces the drug theme. John in  \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" reinforces the drug theme with beautiful images and exciting music. Paul says it's \\"Getting Better\\", sounding hopeful but they admit \\"it can't get no worse.\\" John confesses a severe fault and deep regret, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved.\\" In \\"Fixing a Hole\\", Paul tries to keep things together and even improve as a person.  \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is sad song that expresses the breakdown of the family as young girls struck out on their own (usually too early and thus getting into plenty of trouble). \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" is John brilliantly making-something-out of nothing,theme and lyrics from a circus poster in his possession, very trippy sounding. All these songs are very different, excellently and innovatively done.  But there is something spiritually wrong under the surface.  Side Two opens with George's \\"Within You Without You\\", a fabulously complex song exploring deep concepts - but, at the end, inexplicably, laughter is heard.  People are actually laughing (!) at deep thoughts like \\"With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew\\", and at \\"And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you\\"! The audience is not getting it!  They think it's still a show, when it's LIFE.  To keep them happy, Paul sings \\"When I'm 64\\", a lighthearted song he delivers in the style of vaudeville, crowd pleaser.  \\"Lovely Rita\\" is Paul's ironic look at a thwarted seduction.  Then John takes over, and things start to fall apart fast.  \\"Good Morning\\" is a negative look at ordinarily (drug-free) life which he sees as pointless: \\"nothing to say\\", \\"nothing to do\\" of any importance, so to make life interesting this married man starts looking for other women. After this, the \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" song is reprised, faster now and trying to get away from the hopelessness which has popped out all over, and was not ostensibly the original intent.  It's just about over, then slowly, John starts \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  His mind is just about fried now, people are dying but he can't feel anything.  He drops some acid, \\"I'd love to turn you on.\\" The orchestra starts on a low note, in a nerve shredding climb to the top note.  An alarm clock rings, taking us back to reality.  Paul jumps in to save the day, gets up quickly and ready for work, but even he had a smoke and \\"went into a dream.\\"  Paul and John actually moan in seeming agony for several bars, followed by an orchestra of doom.  Then John sings again, he is now talking completely senseless, he is so far out, and he wants everyone else to be there with him:  \\"I'd love to turn you on.\\"  The orchestra begins again the nerve-shredding, heart-poundingly slow ascent to the top, and ends with an endless, end-of-the-world chord which trails off into the sound of the Universe, the OM.  The ultimate in nihilism, the end of the album is the opposite of what they set out to do.  That is the sixties, folks!  If anyone wants to comment on this they can e-mail me at jcarterwc@aol.com  Thanks.  Oh, and P.S., let's not forget that George Martin polished almost all the Beatles music into the art forms they became.
0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot takes us on a journey through quantum mechanics and its parallels with metaphysics.  The theory that everything is interconnected at a fundamental level goes a long way towards rationalising the many strange aspects of our world.      This book is the closest and most concise explanation of a \\"theory of everything\\" that I have ever read.  A truly mind expanding and challenging book.      A must read.
B000002H2H|5.0|One could make a strong argument for any of Metallica's first five albums to be considered their greatest. But in the next few paragraphs I will do my best to convince you that \\"Ride the Lightning\\" surpasses them all with a track-by-track analysis. <br />1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10- Actually took me a long time to get into, but quickly rose up the list of favorite Metallica songs. The classic guitar solo intro somehow gets my adreniline flowing, getting me ready for Hetfield's relentless riffs. A song about nuclear war, also has a great two-part guitar solo. A masterpiece of the speed metal genre. <br />2. Ride the Lightning 10/10- Slightly slower than \\"Fight\\" but just as heavy, this song brings out Metallica's progressive influences, paving the way for the progressive metal genre. This song has top-notch singing (or growling) and numerous great riffs by Hetfield. In the middle is Hammett's GREATEST solo ever, it is truly incredible! This is always decribed as one of Metallica's greatest songs, but I'm making a statement; this IS Metallica's best song ever. Another astonishing masterpiece. <br />3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10/10- The music is slowed down somewhat more, but again is just as heavy. Has thoughful lyrics by Hetfield as well as an unforgettable riff. The haunting bell at the end seals another masterpiece for Metallica's catalogue. <br />4. Fade to Black 10/10- A song about suicide, has an acoustic guitar riff that becomes etched in the listener's mind. The acoustic guitar fades away to a heavy, wordless chorus. Incredible lyrics and a remarkable thrashy ending. Once again, a masterpiece. <br />5. Trapped Under Ice 10/10- Is not as monumental as the first four, but has a lightning-fast riff and THREE solos by Hammett. <br />6. Escape 9/10- Much slower but still different from the first five songs. Many fans consider this a filler song, but has a great solo and is ironically the song that is played the most on the radio from this album. <br />7. CreepingDeath 7/10- A favorite at concerts, this song is about Moses and the plagues that he brought on the Pharoah. A good solo is in the middle, but the chorus is kind of annoying. <br />8. Call of Ktulu 9/10- An instrumental of which I have no idea what this is about. More good solos and riffs sprinkled throughout, but the drumming is a nuisance because all Ulrich does is clash the cymbols, which sound grand and epic at first, but gets old fast. A great instrumental even at nine minutes but is a poor song to close the album. <br />This album does something that few other thrash albums could boast in the 80's; have the lyrics be a strongpoint in the songs instead of a neccessity. While most other bands were writing about witchcraft, evil, and Satan; Metallica writes an album about many different ways to die, but in a way that never glorifies it. The lyrics are an art as much as the music is. While this is definitely not the best production of Metallica's career, I love the way both Hetfield and Hammett sound on guitar as well as how the vocals sound. What else makes this album so great is that every song is different, none of the cookie-cutter song structures of their later albums. I've nearly run out of words so I will end in saying that I hope that you enjoy this album as much as I do.
B000075BFK|1.0|How else could he be coming out with new, not unreleased, music? You have to be ALIVE, although Pac supposedly isn't. If Pac ain't dead, he should tell the world, instead of pretending like he is to get attention. Overall, this album with NEW(?!?!) material is very lackluster, and hurts 2Pac's name. Don't get this junk. Wait to be proven that Tupac really IS dead.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|Thats all, the car chase is barely better, and there is no other action sequence in the whole damn movie, acid trippin camera movements DONT COUNT AS ACTION SCENES, in fact they can ruin the only fight and car cahse you have (which they did), i guess they spent all their budget on all the cocaine they gave the camera guy instead of buying him a stand.  The performances are average at best, the story is predictable and routine (the framing someon for a murder as been done, to death), there is humor, drama, suspense, nothing.  1 out of a 10 for the improved car chase, but it still isnt even remotly comparible to the one in Matrix Reloaded (the best car chase ever), no visual effects isnt really something to be proud of, dont make a third there cant possibly be a market left for this, but i guess since they are still making damn chucky movies, anything is possible.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Since I was given the Firefly DVD set last Christmas, I have watched every single episode no less than five times, and several of them more often than that. The jokes, even the ones I quote, continue to make me laugh as soon as the actors utter them. The non-verbal acting done by the cast is some of the *best* to have ever appeared on network TV. The writing is flawless, the world is believable, and the story is entrhalling.<br /><br />Often, when my husband and I have company over, we bring out Firefly so we can bring a few more people into the fan club. Almost always, our friends want to see more than what we've shown them--and this goes for those who have seen the whole series.<br /><br />While it's sad that Firefly's run was short-lived, fans can be relieved that their favorite actors and characters will reappear in the movie \\"sequel\\" to the series, Serenity, which will be in theaters in April, 2005. Until then, the series as it currently stands can be watched again and again.
B000002HPV|5.0|After two very eclectic albums filled with experiments in sound and vocals, Bjork bounced back with this perfect gem, `Homogenic'.  The saying `third times the charm' is entirely true; this is the first Bjork album with a definitive musical style, which carries throughout.  Gone are the upbeat techno beats of `Debut' and the flair of `Post'.  `Homogenic' is very dark, raw, powerful and completely timeless.  Touching on universal issues of life, love, revelations and hurt, Bjork delves deeper than ever before.  Again, Bjork is experimenting, but it's obvious she feels at home here.  The music is very creative; it's like she took her native hymns and songs and added techno beats.  It's very modern, and lovely. <br /> <br />This is probably my favorite Bjork album as a whole.  All of them are wonderful, but `Homogenic' seems to flow the best.  There are light moments, but they are few and far between.  Get ready for a whole lot of pain and power to get thrown at you; Bjork's voice is gorgeous as she sings, growls and teases with enthusiasm. <br /> <br />Hunter: At first, I wasn't excited about this.  But after a while, this track seems to grow on you.  Subtly aggressive, Bjork sings as if she's searching for answers, and she won't give up until she finds them.  I'm always inspired to push myself more after hearing this.  The drum rolls give the song a marching feel filled with persistence, and the constant `ooohs' and `ahhhs' are enchanting.  One of Bjork's best lyrics is in this song: `I thought I could organize freedom, how Scandinavian of me'.  I admire Bjork's courage to throw an accordion in, and the organization of this song is fantastic! (5/5) <br /> <br />Joga: The first time I heard this song, I was completely blown away.  It opens with a gorgeous string arrangement, joined by Bjork's tender vocals (yes, she actually sings sweeter here).  Later, warped drumbeats join the warm strings.  The lyrical arrangement here is spectacular; it's wonderful to sing!  I'm not entirely sure what this song is about.  Regardless, it subtly rips your heart out hearing it (which is, as all true Bjork fans know, an awesome feeling with her music).  The end is one of her most beautiful moments; her vocals fade out into what seems like another dimension of floating music.  The strings begin to echo beyond all boundaries of time and space and her Icelandic vocals soar.  The time signature changes in the chorus are innovative and impressive. (6/5) &#60;- this is valid for Bjork songs :) <br /> <br />Unravel: I was captivated while listening to this.  Bjork is waiting for her lover to return, and while she's waiting, she's going through a whole range of emotions, perfectly portrayed here.  The soft saxophones and gentle drumbeats are spellbinding, and the playful electronic piano slides add a hint of optimism.  Toward the end, a church organ takes over the chord progressions.  This song almost brings me to tears: it's like Bjork is reaching out with all the strength she has left to get her love back.  This is simply fantastic! (6/5) <br /> <br />Bachelorette: The power here is breathtaking!  Right off the bat, the song opens with soaring strings (clearly her main instrument of choice on this album) and a demanding drumbeat.  I absolutely love the piano; it's not often she uses it in any of her work, and it's a nice arrangement here.  The lyrics are phenomenal and thought provoking.  Amazingly, it took me a few listens to really enjoy this song, but I have grown to adore it.  It's almost joyfully depressing, which of course doesn't make sense, but this is Bjork, so it works (and Bjork fans know what exactly what I mean). (6/5) <br /> <br />All Neon Like: I've been trying to decipher this song for weeks now.  My thought is that it's about being born.  It's very odd, very drawn out and altogether gorgeous.  The glossy chords make me think of a room full of glass.  It's very melodic and dreamlike.  There isn't much to this song musically; the glass-like echoes, a simple beat and several electronic blips.  Bjork creates the effect of random explosions well here (which she strives to do for the whole album). (5/5) <br /> <br />5 Years: Okay, several other listeners haven't been too impressed with this.  I can't seem to get enough of it!  It's completely catchy, and it just hooks you.  The playful chords, the syncopated beats (just awesome here!) and the heavenly strings which come in later; it's divine!  Bjork's vocals are filled with so much aggression and power.  Every time she sings the refrain, she pours out more emotion and drama.  Whether or not she overdid it here doesn't matter; this is a fantastic song!  It's a real stress reducer in a way, and makes you feel like you've got the power in a relationship.  The strings build higher and higher until the end, and it's just breathtaking. (6/5) <br /> <br />Immature: `5 Years' ends abruptly, and right away this takes over.  It's very seductive in a way, warm and quiet.  Once in a while, Bjork belts out some very clear notes, adding emotional flavor.  Similar to `Unravel', there's an echoing chord sound that glides through the whole song, which I just can't describe.  It's very captivating!  This is a revelation for Bjork; she's realized how silly she was to think a guy could change her world.  It's so typical of most of us, and I think she portrays it beautifully here. (5/5) <br /> <br />Alarm Call: I love it, I love it!  This reminds me of some of Bjork's older tunes; it's very danceable, it has an infectious beat, and it's definitely the most upbeat and positive song on the album.  There's almost a jazzy feel here, and it's very enjoyable.  The baseline in particular is real fun!  Throughout the song, you hear the recording of Bjork singing `it doesn't scare me at all'.  She's trying to save the world with music, and I love that idea.  This is a very likable song, and probably the most accessible on `Homogenic': it would appeal to a wide range of listeners.The `beep, beeps' toward the end are so awesome!  I just love the catchiness here! (6/5) <br /> <br />Pluto: I won't lie; you have to be in a particular mood to like this song.  I love it sometimes, and can't stand it other times.  It's very much an electronic tune; it doesn't have any melodies in it to speak of, and it's a whole lot of noise.  Regardless, it's the climax of the album.  It's like all of Bjork's emotions have been amplified ten times and played back with a ton of distortion.  Her lyrics `I just have to explode now' fit perfectly.  She does a lot of screaming here, so if you can't stand loud yelling, you might want to skip this.  I get a spooky feeling listening to this; it's like I'm being watched or something.  It's a neat sensation, as all emotions are when listening to Bjork. (4/5) <br /> <br />All Is Full Of Love: This is one of Bjork's best songs ever!  I can't stress that enough.  Though the video version is much better than this, there's a charm and a lightheartedness here that is profound and absolutely stunning.  What makes this song so fantastic is it's like the sun after a rainstorm: after `Pluto' it's nice to have such a beautiful tune playing.  With no percussion, amplified gentle sweep effects, a gorgeous sitar and a playful clarinet, this song puts you in a trance.  This is one of the most sensual songs I've ever heard by any artist (although the video version is much more sensual than this).  It just makes you feel affectionate, warm, fuzzy and lovable! (6/5) <br /> <br />This is the most complete collection of songs Bjork ever put together.  What's disappointing is that there are only 10 tracks on the album.  That's my one complaint.  I would have loved to hear more of Bjork's rendition of Icelandic-techno-pop.  She outdid herself in every possible way as an artist here.  Though the songs are more often than not heartbreaking and pessimistic, there's an incredible amount of hope.  I adore this album!  Bjork's emotional conviction isbest displayed here.  If you have any of her other albums and you find them enjoyable, I highly recommend this!  However, beware: this album is very unique, and if you haven't heard any Bjork before, this probably isn't the best choice to ease into her style (`Post' is the perfect Bjork beginner's album).  But, if you're adventurous and just waiting for something awesome and powerful to enter your ears, you might as well get `Homogenic'.

B00002E23E|5.0|Im 17, so i have not had the chance, and will never, to see this legendary band play live, but at least i can watch their unbelivable performances on dvd.  Personally i think Page is the best guitar player who ever, and will ever live, and getting to see him solo with a violin bow for 20 mins is a blessing.  Plant's vocals are mesmerizing, Bonham's drumming is undeniably some of the best, if not the best, and he also gets his 20 min solo in between Pages constant masterful guitar work, and Jones shows us he can carry rythm, while Page displays his skill.  Have i mentioned Page is the best guitar player ever, yeah thats right i said he was better then Hendrix, what are you gonna do about it?  Hendrix is defintly  a true master, but unfortunatly he didnt write material worthy of his skill, but i mean how many guys do you know that can set their guitar on fire and play it with their teeth, and more, but i like Pages music better.  The fantasy scenes were wierd, didnt make sense, but what do you expect from potheads, at least they keep playin kick ass music throughout, and the opening when Bonham shoots the guy and his head falls of and skittles spurt out was funny.  10 out of a 10 for the best band ever, playin the best music ever, cant wait to get the complete studio recordings box set, i just need the $100.  RAP SUCKS, if you have taste listen to ROCK, if you want to hear black guys talk about drugs and shootin white people watch cops, dont give them millions for ruining music.
068987474X|1.0|Women, don't buy this book.  If you don't know what the authors are saying then 1) you're seriously naive; 2) you're in complete denial; 3) you're seriously retarded or perhaps you're all three.  Yes, men aren't usually straightforward and instead of just \\"I'm not feelin's you\\" they have to do all kinds of bs to let you know that.  However, this is not rocket science nor some new, startling revelation.  You do not need to spend $19.95 to find this out (and I'm glad I didn't...skimming is great!).  What would be a great revelation (and what Greg conviniently leaves out) is why most men act like scared little mice when they're not into a girl and just don't come forward with the truth.  Then again I guess that not too hard to figure out either although I'm sure someone will unforunately write a book on that too.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Had I watched Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or Sorcerer's for the American version, see the book review for this) without the sequels, I'd probably give it a 5 becuase for 11-year-olds the acting didn't seem that bad. The sequels are superior in both acting and directing. <br /> <br />Becuase this movie is derived from a book, I'm not going to write a summary but instead focus on the caliber of the film-making. <br /> <br />Chris Columbus did a very good job on the first Harry Potter. The storyline is rather basic, though, becuase of the need to introduce all the characters. Cinematography is decient (it's no \\"2001\\" or \\"The Matrix\\" but, you get what I mean). In acting, we have many famous English actors joining the trio of then-newbies. The now-deceased Richard Harris (Resquiescant in Pace) does a fabulous job as the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Other famous actors and actresses include: Maggie Smith, Robbie Cultrane, and Alan Rickman (his role as Serverus Snape is underused for his talent at being villainous, like in Die Hard)  <br /> <br />Overall, good for the family (except the fight scene which is a little grim for a children's movie) and quite entertaining. Four stars.
0060934913|2.0|Anthony Bourdain is the (abeit less-witty less-varied) Howard Marks of the culinary world. And he knows how bad he is. And will tell you over and over again because you are expected to be entralled by 300+ pages of this. <br /> <br />He is so happy to remind you of the amount of drugs he has taken and his love of kitchen chaos, and this work comes to serve little actual purpose outside of a self-indulgent recount of his numbing adventures. Honestly, this piece could have easily been condensed to a chapter on his misadventures and a chapter for the rest. <br /> <br />There are very few tips, even fewer stories worth recounting and the work is framed around an incoherant chronology. <br /> <br />I do give Bourdain complete credit for his writing, which is actually wonderfully varied, intelligent and impressive. This is possibly the only positive to this dullish piece.

0451457994|5.0|2001: A Space Odyssey is the first book in the four part series written by the visionary Arthur C. Clarke. The other three books in the series being 2010, 2061, and 3001. This book of imaginative ideas paints word pictures inside the readers' head.  <br />The book begins in late B.C. with the journey of a band of apes. The apes encounter a strange rectangular \\"box\\". The box, which will later be referred to as the Monolith, always shows up to change the world's way of thing. The Monolith is the alpha and the omega, it created the world and it can rebuild the world as it wishes. The main character and his crew search for the Monolith and find much more then they ever bargained for. <br />2001 really was ahead of its time when it was written (Clarke was writing about space and its travels before the first NASA space shuttle was ever launched.) The book really makes the reader think about creation and what happened to create the world and why the world changes like it does. It tests the boundaries of which normal people think. It may change the readers mind on many subjects including the way people are born, grow, age and die.  <br />By reading this book, the reader will gain new knowledge about life. The reader will be compelled to read it again, as I was. Nothing could stop me from reading the other three books, all as imaginative (but not really as good) as 2001. I did see the movie directed by the late Stanley Kubrick before I read the book, but I feel that the book has more impact. (Though the movie is one of the best I have ever seen.) I strongly recommend watching the movie after reading the book; it will connect many things that may not have been as clear.   <br />I loved this book, and if the reader enjoyed it as much as I did, the reader will want to read again and again. <br />This book will blow your mind. <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|The movie is pretty good for the most part but has some glaring problems. First of all is the terrible casting. This is a greek epic-with no greeks! I realize the move was made in America but come on! Brendan Gleeson &#60;the big red headed Irish guy from gangs of  new york&#62; as a Greek king? Laughable. Brad Pitt as Achilles? I like Pitt but he should be playing Sigfried not Achilles. The main bright spot to this movie is Eric Bana as Hector. Bana comes off as truely heroic, and the most likable character of the film. He fights for his country, his family , and because he has to. That is a stark contrast to Achilles vain quest for personal glory and fame. The moves suffers badly after Hectors death. Once<br /><br />he gets killed by the vain peacock achilles I did not have anyone to cheer for and lost total interest. But its not all bad, the action sequences are spectacular and make this DVD worth owning by themselves.

B0000024RB|5.0|My LP copy of this album is a hand-me-down. It was also a hand-me-down when my late grandparents owned it. My uncle got it at a garage sale with many other record albums in late 1979. Here,Andy Williams,although he never had a film career,goes Hollywood with twelve awesome movie themes from films theatrically released in the 40's,50's and 60's. This album was originally released in 1962 in stereo and mono. My copy was stereo(just how I like it). I first heard LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING on the GREASE movie soundtrack. It was recorded by an unknown artist(there were unknown voices but no words). A SUMMER PLACE was a hit in 1960 for Percy Faith. MARIA is so beautiful. I also love the \\"la-la-la-la's\\" on NEVER ON SUNDAY. The title track,co-written by Johnny Mercer and the late Henry Mancini is from 1961's BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY's starring the late Audrey Hepburn. All the other songs are good. Like THE ANDY WILLIAMS CHRISTMAS ALBUM,Williams sports a tuxedo in the cover photo.
B00005YXZH|5.0|YHF blends the traditional Wilco countty feel with soft rock to create a never-before heard sound. It is unique and highly enticing. \\"Jesus, etc\\" is one of the most underated songs of our time. The violin opening brings a new level to Wilco's music. Combined with the slow and gentle rhythm and perfect lyrics. <br /> <br />Whereas \\"Poor Places\\" builds up for a minute and a half and then explodes gently into musical enchantment. This contrasts pleasently with the raring intro to \\"I'm The Man That Loves You\\". <br /> <br />Once you have listen to this once, you will be listening to it for the rest of your life. The most intricate album of the past decade!

B000002HJA|4.0|My initial impression this cd was of slight dissapointment, especially considering the amazingly high quality of past kyuss releases. However, after listening to the album several more times, it is apparent that And the Circus Leaves Town is a fine release. <br /> <br />It is often difficult to not compare an band's effort to their other efforts. The problem with Kyuss is that their past records are often held in such high esteem that one believes that anything coming from the band must be of exceptional quality as well. However, this does tend to lead to bias, since it is impossible to expect a band to release the same record over and over again. As such, each record that a band releases must be considered independently. <br /> <br />Compositions on And the Circus Leaves Town tend to be a shorter than those found on the band's previous efforts. As such, the listening tends to over much faster than other records. Several of the band's cuts off this one are shimmering with genious, such as Catamaran, Hurricane and Spaceship Landing. Most of the cuts, however, will not sink un immediatley. It will take considerable time for this album to sink. Therein lies the irony: Despite having shorter songs and somewhat less structure, And the Circus Leaves Town is not an accessible album. That in itself lends credence to why many fans do not care for it. <br /> <br />However, those who have patience with this one discover that is indeed an amazing album. The desert feeling of loneliness is preserved, making this album a definite hit with me. And the Circus Leaves town is not album will you will love immediatley. This is also not another Welcome to Sky Valley. For what it is, And the Circus Leaves Town is reminder of one of the greatest artists to have ever walked the Earth.
B000002MJ0|4.0|So many people trip over the beauty, genius, and hype of \\"Loveless\\" and never bothers to dig further. \\"Isn't Anything\\" is not the complete wall of perfect guitar noise that we are blessed with on Loveless. However, the seeds of genius are there. This album is not to be ignored as just \\"Less-Than-Loveless;\\" it is Kevin Shields in the midst of honing his skills and vision. Taken on its own, this is a unique, stylish, guitar rock album that stands up well with almost anything that reared it's head in the late eighties.
B0000A118M|5.0|December 9th 1964 was the very day that this classic was recorded at the legendary Englewood Cliffs studios and recorded by the legendary Rudy Van Gelder.Since then it has gone on to be one of the best selling best loved jazz recordings of all time.It has also ( like Miles Davis' 'Kind Of Blue' and Eric Dolphy's 'Out To Lunch')a huge influence on rock music.The playing between Coltrane,Tyner,Garrison and the late great Elvin Jones is outstanding throughout.I have already have this as part of the complete classic Coltrane quintet box set.It still the classic masterpeice as when it was first recorded 40 years ago and has not dated.
B00005R23S|5.0|For a long time, I was skeptical of Bruce Springsteen. I never gave him a chance because I just had in my mind the typical caricature that's been conjured up of him: one-dimensional, anthemic and elementary songwriter, and average guitar player. After buying this DVD on a whim, I found myself kicking myself for not getting into his music much earlier. To put it simply, this is one of the finest concert DVD's I have seen. A friend of mine saw Bruce on the Born In The USA Tour in the 80's, and he described the show this way: \\"I've never been in a place where there was more happiness on such a large scale.\\" This DVD perfectly conveys that \\"happiness\\" on the part of the crowd. You can see it on the faces in the crowd: 50 year old men who are probably accountants or executives, looking up at Bruce with an expression of awe and joy, thanking him for the years of happiness and companionship he's provided through his music. It is so obvious that Bruce loves what he does, and he can't seem to get enough of the crowd interaction. The opener, \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\" is a song that was only recently released on the box set \\"Tracks,\\" and it starts things off right. Bruce's exuberance from the first song is infectious, and the quality is so good that you honestly feel like you're right there. \\"Atlantic City\\" is rearranged perfectly, and the buildup at the end is breathtaking. \\"Youngstown\\" is transformed from an acoustic ballad into a heart-pounding, exclamation-inducing powerhouse, thanks to Bruce's impervious vocal chords and Nils Lofgren's brilliant guitar solo (it will leave you speechless). The highlight for me is \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,\\" the E Street anthem. From Bruce's acrobatics at the beginning to the band introductions to the perfection of the band's backing and Bruce's antics, this performance is priceless. Disc One, despite being culled from two shows, flows extraordinarily well as a \\"single show.\\" Disc Two has some great performances of classics, and a nice extra with interviews. It is obvious how much fun Bruce and the band are having, and as Danny Federici said in an interview on Disc 2, \\"We enjoy being together more now than we did before, because when you're young, you don't know what you have.\\" What they have here is a remarkable testament to the strength and integrity of one man and his band. All I can say is that this DVD turned a former Bruce-skeptic/disliker into a fanatic. The 3-CD live set \\"Live 1975-1985\\" is a great companion, as is Dave Marsh's book \\"Two Hearts: The Definitive Biography.\\" Bruce, as I've learned, is quite a bit more than most think. And one helluva performer!extra with interviews.

0694003611|5.0|I bought this book as a special present for my son for his first Christmas, and I was very happy I did. My son enjoys hearing this book read to him before he goes to bed, and the words always seem to calm him more than any other book he reads. Even when he is boisterous, this book lulls him, and I begin to hear his breathing steady as I proceed through the book. This book has also served us well for a long time because there is a lot to look at in the pictures and a changing story in the illustrations that isn't necessarily reflected in the narrative, so he finds something new to look at and comment upon each time we read the book. Because there are not a lot of words per page, the pages go quickly, so a toddler isn't likely to get impatient, and the repetition of the phrases is very soothing.<br /><br />I read an article where a mother used Goodnight Moon to teach her son to say good night to all the things around him, which gave them an excellent routine for getting him to go to bed easily. They would say good night to the moon outside, and then his toys, his clothes, and the light as it was turned off.
B0000024JA|5.0|As one of the Wu-Tang frontmen, Ticallion Stallion, Johhny Blaze, Mr. Mef, Iron Lungs drops a solid debut, and the first solo release from one of the Clansmen. Packed with 13 nicely produced songs from the RZA, the Chinky Eyed-Snot Nosed MC drops some fire. With only 1 track I skip, and 1 classic (the rest being very good songs) it is a very good album. Only 3 of the songs have other rappers on them so you get a lot of Meth on this one (unlike his next 2 albums). His best solo project so far (slightly edging his: T 2000 Judgement Day\\"). A must have rap album for all rap fans.    #1 - 8  #2 - 9  #3 - 9.5 (f/ booster)  #4 - 9 (remix w/ Mary J.

B0002EXH4K|4.0|Countdown To Extinction is Megadeth's fifth album and their most successful album to date. Following Metallica's lead on the Black Album, Megadeth toned down their sound slightly, cutting back on the fury of their previous works. Although this album would spawn their biggest single in \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" and would bring the band into their mainstream, it's not their best work although it's better than their more recent albums.<br /><br />Most of the tracks here are very good with the aforementioned \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" and the nasty \\"Sweating Bullets\\" among their best work. Dave Mustaine's guitar work is still wicked and his lyrics continue to be one of the band's strong suits often speaking of personal demons, perhaps his own at the time, and the political climate. The killer riffs that made them famous are still here in the strong tracks \\"High Speed Dirt\\", \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\", and \\"Architecture of Aggression.\\" The title track and \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" focus more on melody than intensity and work very well. Other strong tracks include \\"This Is My Life\\" and the closing riff heavy \\"Ashes In Your Mouth.\\" The remaining tracks \\"Captive Honour\\" and especially \\"Psychotron\\" aren't up to par. One of their better albums but not great from beginning to end like Peace Sells... or Rust In Peace.
B000025XDU|5.0|When you talk about albums that have made history, Hello is certainly at the top of my list!  This is the album that sets Status Quo apart and has left behind all of the others for me.  This band has defined real, fun, true and honest rock''n'roll.  They basically have taken Chuck Berry's original rockin blues sound, and have polished and refined it with a heavier South London sound.  Caroline should be up there with God Save the Queen as the British national anthem!  Every year, millions attend the annual Status Quo Winter Tour covering Britain almost every night in November and December.  Adolescents and Senior Citizens alike jump up and down, sing their heart out and, especially, smile and laugh for two hours.  Quo (as they are called) have reliably delivered a simple message for 40 years: Let's Rock!  It's too bad America has not really experienced this phenomena - it's worth the plane ticket to the UK! Besides Hello, I would recommend Piledriver, Quo, On the Level, Blue For You, and the more recent Heavy Traffic albums.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|OK, first of all, about the shaky cam thing, listen to most peeps in here, it does hurt and maybe even make you fuzzy... while only watching it IN THEATER! especially if you are sitting in the front rows while the big screen merely fit inisde your eye size, and yes it did make me feel fuzzy after watching it like 1/2 an hour. BUt seriously, seriously! while watching it on DVD at home, all those problems was not only gone, what exchange was the superior feeling watching a 1 1/2 relatively short film with awesome sense of speed pace film! especailly the last car chase scene, omg, i was entirely blown away,  simply ask yourself when did u ever see such wildly car run and clash anywhere in film making? there were so many car scenes out there, but as long as I can remember, none really give that kindda impression like this one, that 10 mins long scene was comprehene in a way merely words can describe how impressive it is, you really need to look for yourself so you can believe, also the bg music catch it just right to make that emotional climax, this is the best action motion picture in 2004. On a personal note, I think the shaky cam thing will get more popular in the future whether some close minds like it not. It's not a trick, it serve a true nature as how we human eyes see things when it involves action. Realize this, start from day 1 when we watch movie, camera stay static is standard for 99% of flims, but none actually ask the question does really serve the real nature of how we look at things, while you are playing ball, or simply doing any sport, looking things staticly is the last thing would happen, while things run in high speed, they looked shaky, period, just because the history of film making never bothered to put that into the equation and somewhat so we people were educated to look at films with static camera shots cannot take away the logic of how we look at things normally, you just need to be more open in this movie, it doesnt even shake on every second, it only happen while there r actions involved if you look carefully. watch it with Identity it wont go wrong.

B0006A9FMI|4.0|Like most, \\"Ghost in the shell\\" alongside \\"Akira\\" were the movies that got me interested in Anime to begin with.    I thought the original had great characters, and an interesting, yet weird, storyline. I also thought the animation was great for its time - The way they blended traditional animation with computer generated images worked great and gave it a mixed 2D/3D feel.    9 years later, a sequal is available, but unfortunately its not quite as good.  One disappointment to me (Being a Dub fan) is that this DVD doesn't have one! The DVD only has the original Japanese language with English Subtitles - And for a release this big (The sequal to one of the most well known anime's ever made) to not have a dub, its kind of shocking. That's simply a personal gripe though. With a movie this weird yet beautiful, I found it hard to follow the storyline while trying to keep up with the animation.    My other disappointment is that this movie simply revolves are Batou and his new partner, opposed to Batou and Motoko from the first film (Who was my favorite character by far).    With those aside, its a beautiful movie. The Computer Generated work on it looks fantastic, and the traditional anime style looks amazing as well.    Fortunately, this DVD does have a few extra features, them being:  *  Commentary by Director Mamoru Oshii  * The Making of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence  * Theatrical Trailer    Not much, especially considering the great special-editions this movie has received in japan, but its better than nothing.    If you enjoyed the original Ghost in the Shell or just want to get into it, I'd recommend this movie. It's not quite as good as the original, but its a more than decent sequal.    It is also very well worth noting the subtitles on the DVD.    Apparently these arent true Subtitles, but actually Closed Captioned subtitles.    This means besides the typical lines of text, you also will see:  [Helicopter Approaching]  [Battou [offscreen]: \\"We've gotta get outof here!\\"]  [Music plays]
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Everything in the director's cut fits the pieces of the thaetrical together. I hafta admit, I only liked the movie for Elektra, cuz she's da bomb. But when I bought the directors cut (to see Elektra's extended fight scenes... Do i sound obsessed) I really got into the new movie. Without the whole \\"PG-13\\" thing, they can really show the dark side of Daredevil and thats what it's about. In Spiderman, the villains end up in jail or unconsious. You know they're just gonna come back. In Daredevil, the people DIE, blood, gore, violence! **Spoilers*** in SPiderman, would they literally gut Mary jane with a sai and then kiss her while the villain stabbed her, holdign her up by her throat as she slowly suffovates only to throw her off a building? ***end spoilers*** no! plus, evanescence (the band that plays during elektra's training) is pretty cool. They have the gothic thing goin on. Listen to the words and it really soudns like what Elektra is feeling. \\"Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold.\\" IF U LOVED THEATRICAL RELEASE, GET DIRECTORS CUT. IF U HATED THEATRIACL, GET DIRECTORS CUT.

I'm looking forward to hearing more music from these guys [in the future].

B00004Z4SD|5.0|My husband insisted I watch this movie, and he pretty much had to cajole me into it. You see, as soon as I heard it was directed by David Lynch, I didn't want to watch it. All of those bad undergraduate memories of gothed-out, late-night \\"Blue Velvet\\" movie get-togethers, having to hear people babble endlessly on about \\"Twin Peaks\\" in the early 90's, and high school \\"Eraserhead\\" days all combined throughout time to make me hate David Lynch. Then I heard \\"The Straight Story\\" was about some guy on a lawn mower. I thought it was going to be pointlessly weird and annoying.<br /><br />I was wrong, thank goodness! This was a hypnotic film that really touches your heart. I never cry when I watch a movie, but this one got the waterworks flowing (I'm embarassed to say). There was nothing weird or pointlessly strange about it (I'm glad!). The musical score was wonderful, and the performances luminous. The storyline is highly creative, while still being a believable slice-of-life at the same time.<br /><br />In an odd way, this film reminded me of \\"Slingblade\\". Pretty much, if you liked \\"Slingblade\\", you'll like this movie. Although this movie is not as dark as \\"Slingblade\\" (in fact, I was surprised to learn after seeing it that \\"The Straight Story\\" is rated G -- usually I dislike movies rates G -- but this is an exception to the rule).<br /><br />This movie is worth buying. Take it from me -- I was prepared to hate this movie, but came away delighted instead!
B0002Y4T92|4.0|What happen to Neal Schon! He had one of the greatest guitar albums of all time (Voice)! Where is he? <br />I hope they release more individual artists sets especially those who \\"didn't make the cut\\" on these 2 DVDs.

B0006J28BO|5.0|Another great work from Studio Ghibli! I was fortunate enough to see the film on the big screen, in Japanese with subtitles, in a crowded theater with children, adults, and teen anime fans. All were enthralled and delighted. I cannot speak to the quality of the English-language dub, but if it's anything like the other Disney/Ghibli DVDs released so far, you'll be able to watch the film either in English or the original Japanese with subtitles, and the English-language version will be pretty good. <br />A bit of background. Ghibli is the animation studio founded by Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away) and Isao Takahata (Graveyard of the Fireflies). Neither directed The Cat Returns, although Miyazaki did have a minor supervisory role in it. The film is also a \\"sequel\\" of sorts to an earlier film, Whispers of the Heart, but not really. Ghibli has never done an all-out sequel, but sometimes characters from one film appear in another (The soot sprites from Totoro make a guest appearance in Spirited Away, the old man in the clock tower in Kiki's Delivery Service returns in Whispers of the Heart, etc.) <br />You do not need to see Whispers of the Heart to \\"get\\" The Cat Returns - it stands on its own. (However, I strongly recommend all of Ghibli's stuff.) In Whispers, a young woman who wants to be a writer creates a fantasy story, and incorporates some elements of the world around her into her tale. Thus, a fat stray cat she meets becomes the villain, while another cat - a lanky, dapperly dressed statue she sees in a curiosity shop - becomes the hero. But these are only minor characters in the overall film, which centers on the young woman, the story she's writing, and her everyday struggles. <br />The Cat Returns, meanwhile, is a delightful fantasy, and the two cats from Whispers of the Heart are at the center of the action. In this film, a young woman saves a cat from being run over in the street. Unbeknownst to her, she has just rescued the son of the King of Cats, and soon her entire life is turned upside down. She's presented with gifts of mice - much to her annoyance - and hundreds of cats follow her to school. Then, she's kidnapped and taken to the land of cats, where she will be \\"honored\\" with marrying the young cat prince she had rescued. It's up to The Baron (the heroic cat statue from the earlier film) and Muta (the fat cat from the earlier film) to rescue her - but the longer she stays, the more cat-like she becomes. <br />I recommend this film for everyone - it's not just for kids or a teen anime fans. Like most of Ghibli's work, it's appropriate for youngsters without being cloying. And it's also a lot of fun.
0671027387|5.0|I have not read any other Dan Brown books prior to this one, but I definately will if this one is an indictor of his writing style.  I was pleasantly thrilled at the fast-paced read of this book.  I literally could not put this book down and found myself reading much too late into the evening, and reading while fixing dinner, and reading while eating dinner, and, well, you get the jist!  Even though the \\"find\\" was not introduced until well into the book, I never even noticed as the build-up was so intense.  I didn't care whether or not all of the logistics were right on the money or not, the speed of this book in throwing on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot twists kept me from worrying about whether or not the F14 flight was really plausible or not, or whether the creature that made the fossil could have really existed.  This was just a very, very good read and that's what I wanted - and more than received.
0439101336|5.0|This book is one of the most meaningful of all time and one I think should be read more often than just watched on television during the Christmas season. It is a tale of a small, cruel, and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul. He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change. <br />  After the spirits visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonymously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.  <br />  I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old. <br />
0676974120|5.0|I disagree with the first reviewer. The book is aptly titled &quot;Feast&quot;, meaning just that. Nigella not only presents traditional feast menus from different cultures, she educates the reader on the diverse customs and traditions, and in doing so rekindles the readers own memories. Throughout the ages, celebrations were always marked by serving meat, and rich and elaborate dishes both sweet and savoury. Such feasts were always indicative of abundance, affluence and celebration!<br />If you're looking for a book with low-cal/fat/sugar, vegetarian recipes, you've missed the whole point of this book.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Since Roger Friedman of Fox New's wrote an article (not entirely true), reviewers are so easily fed into what they hear, have come on here. <br /> <br />Its sad to think what aspects affect people's choices. A reviewer says they can't buy this because of legal ordeals. That should not affect your choice of purchasing an item. Though a man can be easily extorted, you should not beleive everything you hear. <br /> <br />Think about this: He is the biggest selling artist of all time, captivated us with his unbeleivable music, and set world records that no one could beat: neither Elvis nor the Beatles.  <br /> <br />So to say that legal woes will keep you from buying a masterpiece, then I feel sorry for you. Until then, gain some common sense: he's innocent!
B000000W5L|5.0|This is the Stones' best album because it is the best reflection of what they can do musically. Namely, it has some hit singles (\\"Tumblin' Dice,\\" \\"Rocks Off,\\" etc.), but the rest of it -- yes, the filler -- is nasty also. I would say the only exception to that would be \\"Just Wanna See His Face.\\" This album sounds like a bunch of young junkies who are musical geniuses playing on Saturday night in a dirty club somewhere, then playing again the morning after recovering from their hangovers. <br /> <br />Most Stones fans prefer LET IT BLEED or STICKY FINGERS. Just think about that for a second: How many good songs are there on LET IT BLEED? \\"Gimme Shelter\\" shook the world, okay? \\"Monkey Man\\" and \\"Live with Me\\" were great too. But \\"Country Honk?\\" The version of \\"Midnight Rambler\\" on that album was terrible! And as for STICKY FINGERS, \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Bitch\\" were earth shakers, so was \\"Wild Horses,\\" but \\"Sister Morphine?\\" \\"I got the Blues?\\" \\"You Gotta Move?\\" Please! There are no such excuses for songs on EXILE. Just listen to the burning lead guitar on \\"All Down The Line?\\" How about \\"Rip this Joint,\\" \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" \\"Shine a Light?\\" It is all solid, and thus has my vote for the Stones' best album.
B00001OH7U|5.0|An album fueled by cocaine paranoia, Station to Station is just crazy, but brilliant. The epic title track  is one of my Bowie favourites, switching gears from hard rock ( check out the almost frightening opening, where what sounds like a train approaches, growing louder and faster, almost like it's coming toward you )  to disco about halfway through, announced  with the lyrics \\" It's not the side effects of the cocaine, I'm thinking that it must be love.\\" YES! \\"Golden Years\\" was the pop hit from this album, deservedly so. I really love the \\"wah - wah - wah\\" part  in the chorus. Incredibly catchy, put not  pablum pop like most of the songs you hear from the seventies. This album has held up very well indeed , as it is almost 30 years old and still sounds great to my ears. Bonus points for the awesome production work by Bowie and Harry Maslin. Very accesible, but  every bit as avant garde as the famous Berlin trilogy that followed it, Station to Station is classic Bowie.

B00001OH7O|5.0|As I delved deeper and deeper into Bowie's back catalogue I found this excellent album. I have never been a big fan of the hit single \\"Changes\\", which is admittedly a great song, perhaps a little overplayed, but there is so much more here. \\"Life on Mars\\" is perhaps Bowie's best song ever ( and check out the Mick Rock directed video of this song if you  get a chance - it is just  stunning, a wonderful visual  compliment to an incredible song.)\\"Andy Warhol\\" is gentle folk rocker with twisted lyrics and a hilarious spoken intro. \\"Queen Bitch\\" is a great glam rocker, its lyrics a pointed barb at those who try too hard to dress up but totally miss the point of doing it. ( \\" God, I could do better than that!!\\" Bowie sings ... great lyrics on this one!) Overall this one covers many bases, from folk to rock to string enhanced ballads. ( Rick Wakeman, soon to join British  prog rockers  Yes, plays piano on a few songs on this album, and Bowie's guitarist, the criminally under-rated  and incredibly versatile Mick Ronson, had a hand in the string arrangements.) If all you know of Bowie is his 80's hits like \\"Let's Dance\\" this album might come as a bit of a shock to you. But it's a great place to start digging into David.

B00005YJMX|4.0|\\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" is director Werner Herzog's tribute to F. W. Murnau, whom he considers to be Germany's greatest filmmaker, as well as a haunting gothic horror tale in its own right. It is a remake of Murnau's 1922 film \\"Nosferatu\\", which is the earliest surviving cinematic adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel \\"Dracula\\". Herzog has combined ideas from Murnau's film, Bram Stoker's novel, and his own imagination in creating a film that is, if anything, even more expressionistic and romanticist than the 1922 masterpiece. It is also more languid and pathetic than other \\"Dracula\\" adaptations.<br /><br />This version of the Dracula tale, like 1922's \\"Nosferatu\\", takes place in Germany and Transylvania. Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) is a real estate agent employed by a madman named Renfield (Roland Topor) to deliver a contract to Count Dracula in Transylvania, who wishes to purchase property in Wismar, Germany. When he reaches his destination, Jonathan finds a hideous, predatory Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) eager to sign the deed to his new home. Several days later, ill and traumatized by horrors that he experienced at Dracula's castle, Jonathan understands that his young wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) will be in grave danger if Dracula reaches Wismar and sets out to save her. Count Dracula's arrival in Wismar coincides with the Plague. The city is overrun with rats and its population decimated by disease. Only Lucy comprehends the nature of the evil that has befallen the city and understands what she must do to stop it.<br /><br />\\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" adheres pretty closely to Murnau's storyline, rather than Stoker's, except for the ending. The characters and actions have been embellished, however, sometimes with inspiration from the \\"Dracula\\" novel. Herzog's film moves slowly but steadily and spends more time with the characters than any previous \\"Dracula\\" adaptation. Count Dracula closely resembles Murnau's vampire but is even more grotesque and the least aristocratic of any cinematic Dracula. He is rodent-like and closely associated with rats and the Plague. But he departs from other Dracula interpretations in lamenting his permanent un-dead existence without light or love for centuries, which makes him a slightly tragic character. Although Count Dracula is the force that drives the narrative, the first half of the film is about Jonathan, and the second half concentrates on Lucy. Lucy Harker takes much inspiration from the character of Mina Harker in the novel \\"Dracula\\". The film's Lucy is more mystical and less methodical than the book's Mina. But, like Mina, she is stronger and smarter than the characters who surround her, and she tries her best to save everyone in spite of their blindness. Isabelle Adjani's Lucy Harker is the strongest heroine of any \\"Dracula\\" film.<br /><br />Like Murnau's 1922 film, \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" is visually expressionistic and romanticist. More of the film takes place outdoors than in other adaptations. There are lots of wide open spaces which are brightly lit, lending the outdoor scenes an airy feel, while scenes indoors tend to be dark and oppressive. This is clearly taken from the Murnau film, with its seaside scenes and bright sunshine. But the color cinematography and superior technology creates a sense of space that Murnau's film doesn't have. Colored lighting is lifted directly from Murnau's film, however. 1922's \\"Nosferatu\\" was filmed in black-and-white and tinted several colors to communicate time and mood. \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\"'s night scenes are bathed in blue light, and the inside of Dracula's castle is close to sepia, producing much the same effects as Murnau's toning.<br /><br />English and German versions of \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" were filmed concurrently. Werner Herzog shot the scenes with dialogue twice -once in German, once in English. The two versions differ by only seconds in length, but they are edited slightly differently. Whichever one you see, \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\"is one of the most interesting adaptations of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", even if it is an indirect adaptation. It is also the slowest paced and highly expressionistic, which somewhat narrow its appeal.Vampyre\\" is one of the most interesting adaptations of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", even if it is an indirect adaptation.

B0002SROT0|5.0|This is Elliott Smith's best album by a long mile and sadly it's definitely the last album that he meant to release.I am sure over the coming years the archives will be plundered by vultures and we will be able to hear some of the songs that Elliott considered too poor to release in the first place. <br /> <br />To put it mildly, this album is a suicide note set to music.Every grievance that Elliott felt in life is here-painfully,painfully honest stuff. <br /> <br />Anyway, I have to say that whenever I listen to 'From A Basement On A Hill', it makes me feel very sad indeed.The lyrical content of each song is an insight in to the mind of a man who doesn't want to live any more.I find 'Shooting Star' and 'Twilight' particularly distressing because the lyrics make it clear that he was going through a very rough patch with his girlfriend and he was addicted to drugs (\\"I'm already someone else's baby\\").I honestly have cried a few times while listening to 'Twilight'.I can hear how unhappy poor Elliott was but it is of course too late now to help him... <br />Even the song titles are very distressing  e.g. King's Crossing,A Fond Farewell etc.There is a definite pointer to suicide. <br />My own personal favourite song is 'Pretty(Ugly Before)'.I just love the melody, the gorgeous piano and the superb guitar solo in it. <br />I also love the distorted guitars and vocals on 'Coast To Coast' and 'Don't Go Down'. God bless him, he could rock out when he felt like it as well as being a brilliant acoustic guitarist. <br /> <br />I read an article in a British magazine recently that describes this album perfectly : <br />There is some doubt over whether Elliott Smith killed himself or was murdered but it's obvious from the album that he didn't want to live anymore. <br /> <br />God Bless Elliott Smith wherever he is.RIP. <br />
B0000584V3|5.0|This is THE Opeth album that has the power to convert non-metallers to death metal. At least, it happened for me and a few friends. When I first got this album, the only songs I heard were \\"Harvest\\" and \\"Patterns in the Ivy,\\" yeah, the two songs that have absolutely no hint of death metal in them. I didn't like death metal when I got this CD. The only death-vocals I had heard at that point were Cannibal Corpse - what a horrible first impression of death metal. I thought most death metal would be similar - wow, how naïve of me. But it seemed like Opeth was being worshipped by everyone I observed, and I had to know what the deal was, so, I bought it without hearing any of the actual heavy songs Opeth are known for. Actually, I got Morningrise shortly before this, but I was barely interested in it, again, I liked only the song without any death-growls, \\"To Bid You Farewell.\\" Boy was I in for a treat.<br /><br />I gave the album many listens when I first got it. It grew on me very slowly. At first, I specifically only liked the acoustic parts in the songs. Then, I started to tolerate the heavier parts, still shunning away the growls however. Then I began to tolerate the death vocals, and finally, after many listens, I actually enjoyed them and appreciated them, and realized the vocal style is just another tool in music just like anything else, having its own unique qualities. What an album to be introduced to death vocals. The newer-style (MAYH and after) growls of Mikael Akerfeldt remain the best death-vocals I've ever heard. They are a truly demonic sounding, lower-pitched, frightening experience. Not to mention, the lyrics of Opeth are some of the most poetic and contain great imagery.<br /><br />Just an idea how this album inspired an enormous ongoing chain reaction in my music collection: I had about 50 CDs when I bought this in February 2002, now I have over 325 and that number is steadily rising. Around 140 of them are metal of some form or another, probably 99% I would have never heard of, or never gave a chance if I hadn't liked this first. Trust me I'm not bragging, I know there are people with way bigger collections, I'm just saying, in a way, it all started here.<br /><br />Anyway, for those of you already into metal, my little story is irrelevant. We've all got to start somewhere. Compared to other metal bands, Opeth isn't usually as heavy overall. Some parts of this album and most others have some very heavy, aggressive parts, but it is generally not consistent all the way through any song. Their songs are long, winding, progressive journeys with still the best contrast of heavy and soft parts compared to any other band (excluding \\"Damnation\\" of course). Actually this album has slightly more traditional song structures, compared mostly to their first two albums.<br /><br />I think this is Opeth's most \\"Autumny\\" sounding album. \\"Harvest,\\" another word for the season, really accentuates this feeling, but most of the folksy parts in the songs do also. It starts out with \\"The Leper Affinity,\\" with a slow, suspenseful ambient sound that quickly goes into the main song. A good portion of this song is very aggressive, with a barrage of brilliant riffs one after another. After a good 4 minutes, the song settles down a little for a short instrumental heavy part, and then suddenly turns into beautiful acoustic playing for no more than a minute, then returning to the heaviness. And when I said suddenly, it is kind of unexpected, but in a good way. It flows very well in the song and fits perfectly, just at the right time. The song does another musical backflip at the end, slowly fading into a dark, sparse piano melody. \\"Bleak\\" is my favorite song here. It starts off with a little acoustic playing above the distorted wall of sound. The vocals here are truly magnificent. After a few \\"choruses,\\" it goes into an amazing heavy riff with Steven Wilson singing, it couldn't sound more perfect. After that it calms down into an autumny,calmer, a little jazzy part, once again returning to the heaviness, same as the clean vocal part before. The song fades out into a messy distorted noise until the warm, welcoming strumming of \\"Harvest\\" starts. This song is has one of the most traditional song structures for the band, but it's one of those songs that are so good, it doesn't matter if it's a little repetitive. It's not too long, and contains perfect harmonized vocals, and a great solo.<br /><br />\\"The Drapery Falls\\" starts kind of the same, but quickly adds one of the best distorted guitar riffs I've ever heard. This next part switches from a softer strumming and calmer vocals to a heavy, melodic riff with more powerful, yet still clean vocals. Then the death vocals begin, they go on for a while, and later stop quite suddenly for an intensely contrasted part, awesome strumming that keeps switching to ultra-aggressive drumming and heavy guitars. This is probably my second favorite song here. Next is \\"Dirge for November.\\" This starts out with the softest part of the album, almost balladic with a prog-rock feeling that would later be fully explored on \\"Damnation\\", and then very suddenly goes into the middle section which is some of the heaviest stuff on the CD. Then it goes back to a very soft, instrumental jazzy part. This part goes on for slightly too long though without changing and is my single, tiny complaint on this album. Next is \\"The Funeral Portrait\\" which starts with a suspenseful acoustic playing then beginning one of the best riffs in the universe with perfect aggressive vocals to go along with it. All this song's riffs are some of the best I've ever heard. Near the end has a few clean vocals, but other than that there is no clam part, and there is no need for one. \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" reverts back to the other side of the spectrum. It's a gorgeous 2-minute very soft instrumental piece with acoustics and piano. \\"Blackwater Park\\" opens with a heart-pounding riff and goes into a very heavy, mostly instrumental heavy part, then goes into a good 3-minute very atmospheric, ambient instrumental part. The rest of the song is some of the heaviest material here, containing nothing but impressive riffs, and no clean vocals in this song, ending the album with a monumental finishing scream, riff, and tiny little acoustic outro.<br /><br />Give this album a really honest chance if you haven't heard metal before. It's VERY much an acquired taste. Try to listen without distractions. Their whole discography is brilliant so far. They turned out to be much deeper than anything I've heard before. My favorite band at the time was Tool and I thought they were deep - they still are, but a mere pond compared to Opeth which was now a mighty ocean in my eyes.almer, a little jazzy part, once again returning to the heaviness, same as the clean vocal part before.

B000002UY5|5.0|this is the best album ever made...and yes, i am serious. so just go buy it, it will change your life.
B00030590I|4.0|Firstly , I've read alot of the reviews for this film. In my opinion , most reviewers , reveal waaaaay too much. Half of the fun is watching this film reveal itself. So , I'm not going to be long winded. I also notice that there's always comprisons to \\" Croutching Tiger , Hidden Dragon \\". And the reason is because it's in the same league. But you'll never hear or read that it's better than \\"Croutching Tiger\\"...and that's because it's not. However, \\" Hero\\" is just as entertaining and luckily makes some new breakthrough's in it's fighting sequences and stretches the artistic symbolism of film making. If \\"Croutching Tiger , Hidden Dragon\\" was a living person...then \\" Hero \\" would be a favorite, 1st cousin. The cinematography , for \\"Hero\\" is simply too mesmerizing , for any words that I can use to describe it. The plot is basic but also very touching and not predictable. The acting was impressively believable. Especially , during some of the fight sequences.Honestly , alot of the flying stuff , was so absurd that it would be hard to suspend my belief , had it not been for the actors, making me believe, that they could really do that stuff. Top notch directing , with a top knotch cast endures this film to me and ensures that this will be one of those films that become a cult classic. Just like , \\"Enter the Dragon\\" , and \\"Croutching Tiger\\" have become.  Sometimes , it takes an authentic director , with an authentic vision , to create such an authentic film. Although , \\" Hero \\" over saturated the media with previews , and it's reputation for being one of the most thrilling films of the year , proceeded the film itself......I found it to be atleast 90 percent of what it claimed to be. I highly recommend this film and can honestly say that this is another staple film. Movies, like \\" Hero\\", not only keep the martial arts genre alive....but take all films...to a higher level.
0385513755|3.0|I was just sent a copy of this book by a friend of mine who highly recommended it: The Esau Swindle, by Gerald Rothberg. Book about a New York art dealer that gets caught up in the shady dealings of his twin brother in Argentina. Couldn't put it down!! Great stocking stuffer for thriller fans. I went through the whole thing in 48 hours, while recovering from T-day. If I were fifteen years older, the lead would make a great movie part for me. This would have been great for Harrison Ford during his Patriot Games years. Also recommended: The Esau Swindle, Da Vinci Code
6305882592|5.0|This is a movie that I always forget about, and then it pops up every couple of years.  It's a timeless classic that just gets better with age.
0780631684|4.0|The first thing I would like to say about \\"Final Destination\\" is that it's not \\"Final Destination 2.\\" For those of us who saw both films, you know what I'm talking about. If not, I am referring to the first ten minutes of the second film, which surely ranks as one of the finest, most breathtaking ballets of gory mayhem in American horror in the last ten years. That said, I thought the first \\"Final Destination\\" a good, not great film. Perhaps the best thing going for this film is its originality. While \\"Final Destination\\" and its sequel borrow several elements from the tried and true slasher formula, both do something quite different with this tired genre. And a tired genre it is considering the number of straight to video slashers arriving in a video store near you number roughly a couple of billion a month. Many horror fans worry that the rapid increase in the amount of by the numbers horror movies threatens the future of the genre. This concern is understandable yet premature. As long as somewhat original films like \\"Final Destination\\" come along from time to time, I don't think we have much to worry about. At least I hope so.<br /><br />\\"Final Destination\\" begins by introducing us to Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), your typical All-American kid getting ready for a trip to Paris sponsored by his high school French club. But something doesn't seem right. Sinister warnings pointing toward an imminent disaster keep popping up. For example, the digital clock in his bedroom flashes the number of his impending flight. Once he arrives at the airport with his classmates and chaperones, it's a bit disconcerting to notice that the word \\"terminated\\" appears next to his flight number on the arrival/departure board. Coincidence? Maybe, but things soon get much, much worse once the kids get on the airplane and it takes off. Something horrible happens to the plane soon after lifting off the runway, namely the rapid disintegration of the aircraft into a ball of fire. We see people sucked out of a rift in the side of the plane, flames roaring through the passenger cabin, and people screaming as they burn up. Talk about seeing something that will soak you in sweat! These opening scenes successfully play on the fear most of us have about perishing in an airplane disaster. We almost feel cheated when Alex suddenly wakes up, and realizes that the disaster was nothing more than a bad dream. Or was it?<br /><br />Unfortunately, what Alex Browning saw in his nightmare unfolds right before his very eyes. The same conversations occur on the plane, as do the same events. He's so alarmed by the similarities between his dream and reality that he begins panicking, starting a ruckus on the plane that embroils him in a confrontation with class jerk Carter Horton (Kerr Smith). The result of this yelling match is the immediate removal of Browning, class loner Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), Horton, Horton's girlfriend, and one of Alex's friends from the plane. While the authorities severely reprimand the kids for their atrocious behavior, the plane takes off and promptly blows up over the runway, killing everyone on board including the rest of Browning's classmates. Now the authorities express real interest in Browning's dream. But in the interim the survivors of the explosion assume different attitudes toward Alex Browning. Horton's hostility increases exponentially. A teacher left behind because of the fracas also expresses real suspicion about her clairvoyant student. Clear Rivers, however, becomes quite interested in Alex Browning.  What's more interesting is what happens soon after the accident. Browning's friends begin to die in horrific ways. Why? Because his dream thwarted \\"death's design.\\"<br /><br />Alex and all of the survivors were supposed to perish in that plane crash. Since they lived through the catastrophe, their lives imperil the future. At least I think that's the reason. The greatest strength of \\"Final Destination\\" is how death must go to extraordinary measures to make sure these survivors meet their doom. In this respect the grim reaper, although never physically actualized, stands in for the typical slasher maniac. Instead of dispatching various characters with such boring and unimaginative devices as sharp farm implements, something more baroque is in order. The torturous path water takes in a bathroom results in Alex's friend slipping and falling into the shower whereupon he expires from a nasty strangulation. The best atrocity by far happens in a very sudden and unexpected encounter between a bus and Horton's girlfriend. Needless to say, the other survivors drop off one by one in extremely imaginative and painful ways. Fortunately, there is nothing painful about the production values, special effects, and acting in \\"Final Destination.\\" Most of the actors do a good enough job with their roles, even \\"Dawson's Creek\\" refugee Kerr Smith. No one is going to win any awards for their performance here, but the acting is better than most of the histrionics we see in horror movies. Be sure and look for veteran horror actor Tony Todd in a small role as a creepy mortician.<br /><br />I ultimately enjoyed \\"Final Destination,\\" although not as much as I liked the sequel. In the second installment of what looks like an enduring series (there are plans to make a third entry), the filmmakers cleverly linked the two films together while at the same time ramping up the gore to horrific levels. As a big fan of sauce heavy films, I appreciated the extra effort. The second film's DVD also contains a lot more extras than this one. Still, you do get a few trailers, behind the scenes stuff, and a couple of commentary tracks on the \\"Final Destination\\" disc. Give this one a watch--there are worse ways to pass a couple of hours.traordinary measures to make sure these survivors meet their doom.

B00005LOUP|1.0|It's hard to say what's worse: having all your Christmas decorations and gifts stolen on Christmas Eve night, or having to sit through this horrible adaptation of a classic Christmas story. It's hard to believe talented people like Ron Howard and Jim Carrey could take such excellent source material and turn it into one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br />Jim Carrey's performance as the Grinch is nothing more than a rehash of his performance in \\"The Mask,\\" except in this case it completely destroys a classic character. The Grinch is mean, sniveling, and pathetic, not an insane, bouncing-off-the-walls lunatic. <br /> <br />Visually, the movie is very dark, which fits during the scenes at the Grinch's lair, but this presentation continues during scenes showcasing what should be a bright, cheerful Whoville. <br /> <br />Another flaw is that the movie constantly makes references to pop-culture and the real world. This only serves to take you out of this fantasy world and destroy what should be an immersive experience. <br /> <br />But perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the humor, which is crude and disgusting. The movie is filled with \\"funny\\" bits like the Grinch making a sleeping character kiss his dog's rear end, or the Grinch being forced to eat too much and drooling pudding out of his mouth, or a scene in which he falls into a female character's breasts. This movie should heart-warming, not disgusting. <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is an abomination to Christmas, an abomination to Dr. Seuss, and an abomination to the film industry. Instead of serving as a heart-warming reminder of the Christmas spirit, this movie is more like a cold shower for the Holiday season. Do yourself a favor and watch the far superior animated version.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Ok.  I admit it.  I downloaded this album on mp3 a few years back and I did not like it.   <br />I was curious about the sacd version.  As on previous sacds, the improved quality improved the album. <br />And this cd with the surround 5.1 is awesome.  I'm suprised others have not reviews this album.
B00068IOWM|5.0|I love this new album. They have succeded again to reinvent themselves and grow in all the fans hearts. <br />I reccomend this limited collector edition, it has a great 48 page book with drawings and hand written texts. <br />Also you shoud give it time and not rate it at the first audition. It's too subtle for the average listner so you should open your ears more than usual ;)
B000002JNJ|5.0|I'm making this review at 6 AM....I too just realized of what happened to Dimebag, RIP dude, you and Pantera helped me transition through some tough phases in my life, thank you.  This was the album that has influenced my life the most.
B00004ZD69|5.0|This album is among one of my top 10 in my collection as being one of the best - a true gem in any artists' personal collection if you're looking for inspiration for your next piece. Each song carries you into highs and lows that take you from the land which surrounds you, to thinking of those you love (or love to hate), to the political turmoil that affects us all. Godspeed!You Black Emperor have succeeded in creating music which one can be moved by in opposing extremes, making one think, feel and be impressed upon in different ways upon each listen. This is an aural masterpiece.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Two downtrodden gringos (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt), living in the hot dirty streets of 1920s Mexico, tire of waiting around for opportunity to come their way.  In a cheap hangout for down-and-outers, they encounter an old, grizzled prospector full of stories of glorious scores found by brotherhoods of adventurous men set on trying to separate the most precious metals from the earth.  The old man (played by director John Huston's own father, Walter) delivers sermons about the true value of gold and the inevitable turmoil that follows discoveries of pay dirt.  \\"When the piles of gold begin to grown,\\" the prospector says, \\"that's when the trouble starts.\\" <br /> <br />From the moment he appears, Walter Huston steals the movie (remarkable considering many believe this to be Bogart's finest performance).   Gold is his White Whale and his Maltese Falcon.  While at once drawn to it with a lifelong thirst that could not be quenched by huge scores in the past (they only financed future digs), the old man also fears the darkness unearthed with its riches.  He knows how gold can change a man's soul and has seen noble, steady miners become dangerous madmen once bags of gold dust came their way.   Believing riches will not affect them in ways other than by solving their problems, the two men ask the prospector to take them on a dig, as the three of them set out to find The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.   <br />  <br />The story that follows rivals anything ever captured on film, as the action becomes both adventurous and thought provoking.  As their bags of gold accumulate, the three men must face the dangers of other prospectors, bandits and the evil lurking in each other.   Along with Apocalypse Now's Colonel Kurtz, Bogey's character represents one of the greatest depictions of one man's spiral into irrationality.  Every man has his breaking point, and Bogart clearly reaches his.   <br /> <br />Although its legacy will be as a powerful metaphor on the corruptive influenceof wealth, The Treasure of the Sierra Madres also features many irresistible elements that just make the film fun to watch.   Viewers get a thorough crash-course in gold-mining (and will dream about trying it), a young Robert Blake makes an appearance as an adorable street urchin and a Mexican bandit delivers one of those \\"To be or not to be\\", \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn\\" lines that has become part of American culture.    <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is many things at once.  It is violent, disturbing, sweet, sad, funny, horrifying, redemptive, and touching.  It is also a badly flawed gem that hints at being a masterpiece in screaming need of a story editor.    First, the best news about this unique sci-fi story (the science in this case being medical science).  Ashton Kucher, co-producer, is surprisingly believable as Evan, the young man inflicted with a congenital brain disorder that causes him to black out at stressful moments.  This early part of his life is played by two other younger actors, both of whom are equally credible.  This disorder also, as Evan finds later in life, allows him to be transported back in time to embody the younger versions of himself during those stressful moments, so that he can take a different action than he originally did, thereby changing his history and that of those around him.    If Evan hadn't had such a quasi-Dickensian life, this would never come to the forefront, apparently.  But his father \\"ain't quite right,\\" as we learn in the first scene when he's told that his daddy can't come to parents day at school because \\"it would be too dangerous for him.\\"  Add the influence of the equally dysfunctional family that includes his friends Tommy, Kayleigh (adult version played nicely by Amy Smart in four or five different alternate realities), and their dad (an appropriately warped Eric Stolz), and Evan and his friends are scarred for life in several unpleasant ways during their Wonder Years.  When this all leads to one character's suicide, Evan decides to go back and change things and set it all right.    Thus the story shows us repeatedly that the Shakespearean cliche is true about the best laid plans of mice and men oftimes going astray.  By the time Evan figures out how to really make it all right for everybody, he realizes that, in so doing, he must make a sacrifice that he didn't see coming.    Overall the story is a real winner, despite the unpleasantness that turned off so many viewers.  For me, the unpleasantness never become overly oppressive because there's always a sense of hope, thanks to Kucher's energetic (but not too hammy) performance.  Aside from the brutal language and violence, the monstrously gaping holes in story logic are what puts me off from considering this to be a legit favorite.  For instance, in each alternative reality Evan's journals are there, the touchstone he uses to transport himself back into his blackouts.  What, multiple changes of reality didn't change his journals?!  I'll not go into detail about some of the other goofy lapses in common sense that are here, but suffice to say the film suffers by making the viewer frequently frown and say \\"What?!\\"    As for the ending, there are at least four.  The PPV version of the film I saw on DirectTV showed three, and I understand the \\"director's cut\\" ending is much more depressing than any of these three.  Personally I'm glad I didn't see that one.  The ending that features two major characters walking away from each other is perfect, and was presented on PPV as being THE ending (I understand this is the ending shown in theaters).  The alternative endings included one where one character follows the other (yeah, but what happens when the other turns around?) and the other features the two characters meeting and agreeing to go somewhere together (with one of the worst lines of dialogue I've heard this year).  I don't have any desire to see the director's cut ending, wherein Evan goes back to the womb and kills himself, thus ensuring that he never has to experience the pain he goes through in his life but leaving everyone else to their own misery.  What a depressing, selfish copout.    This film is obviously a matter of taste, more so than most are.  I give it 4 stars because it ultimately is vividly imaginative, hopeful, thoughtful, and memorable.  It just doesn't think you're smart enough to see that the writers are trying to pour four hours' worth of ideas into two hours with shortcuts that make no sense.  Rent it before you decide to buy, if the description of the film is interesting to you at all.
B00005JLR8|4.0|A couple of young parents bring their two daughters with them to America partially as a way to escape the death of a loved one.  Surviving in New York City proves to be a challenge, as sweltering heat and dead-end jobs seem to be the city's only consistencies.    Displaying a strong family unit, however, the young parents try to turn NYC into the children's own giant playground (and show the magic that can be created by parents who care).   <br /> <br />Gritty and sometimes hard to watch, this film does not romanticize the immigrant experience, laying America open to all just criticism. However, as an American, I felt proud that I finally saw a film made in the past twenty years that depicted America for what it is to the rest of the world, the land where dreams are born.  <br /> <br />The acting is brilliant (the little girls are unbelievable), the photography makes viewers feel like they are sweating with the suffering residents of New York, and the writing is moving.  While not a film that will stagger viewers with revelations and commentary, the depiction of this little family's new life In America will stay with most people forever.  <br />
6304779607|3.0|Sly manages to parody himself in this over the top cop horror drama that concerns a cult gang that hangs around sewers and clinks axes all day. Sly plays a runaway, foul mouthed and rule breaking cop who says, \\"If a thug aint dead, he aint worth living\\". Make sense of that if you can. It's especially funny to watch Nielson pass off as a credible actress, she was awful in everything else she did, why not here? Yup, you guessed it, bad too! If you get over the tag line then you can savor this for it's rather absurd moments, Sly chewing on a match for one.
0783233477|2.0|Meet Joe Black was a highly anticipated film remake of the 1940's film: Death Takes a Holiday. The similarities should end there. The 1940's film was no great film to begin with, but it is leaps and bounds a better film than this one. <br /> <br />The first reel provides us with a shocking scene that caused me to continue watching this exceedingly long movie for some additional excitement.  It doesn't ever come to fruition. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt plays a wonderful young man who meets an untimely and grisley death in a hit and run accident. In comes the plot device that should make the film engaging and interesting: Death - the actual entity - takes over his body and challenges (more or less) Anthony Hopkins to show me why human life is worth living and why death is so tragic. <br /> <br />This should be able to be done in two hours of less. But, Oh no, intrepid viewers, the producers felt that they had to string us along for three hours to tell this story. (Frankly, the whole thing could have been told in 30 minutes with the same feeling and emotion). <br /> <br />Brad Pitt is playing a romantic lead and he doesn't appear to be comfortable doing it. Anthony Hopkins proves that his talent is hit or miss at best. Claire Forlani - well she just proves that she's just another pretty face who can act reasonably well. <br /> <br />This is a big budget chick flick that really doesn't merit the good reviews it received here. It was widely panned at the theaters (and rightly so). It's a Lifetime movie if I ever saw one. <br /> <br />As someone who would watch Brad Pitt read the newspaper, I was sorely disappointed. <br /> <br />Sorry, I can't rate it any better.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I have read with interest the varying opinions on this CD..and I can understand the wide range of views from outright raves to strong dislike. However, I have been an Alan Parsons fan since my youth (a radio background hasn't hurt, either)..and in my opinion, this is a very well done, if not brilliant, piece of work on Alan's part. He has always dabbled with electronica-sounding instrumentals on past work, but this time he went into it both barrels, and did it well. The thing I like about it is that he was able to capture the spirit of electronica but retain musical structure. Not just a bunch of repetitious noises over loud bass and drums as a lot of techno/electronica is..but instead, there's real music underneath all the production effects.  <br /> <br />I also note with interest that Alan took lead vocals for the first time on one track - \\"We Play The Game\\", and it makes me wonder why he waited 30 years to let us hear him, as he has a very pleasant voice reminiscent of his ex-APP partner, Eric Woolfson. I hope it's not the last time. His production and engineering, as always, is top notch and state of the art.  <br /> <br />Much has been made over the simplistic lyrics, but for a project like this, it doesn't call for Keats or Leo Tolstoy. This was, I think, in the spirit of having fun and staying current, and I think it was largely achieved. I also like it because it shows that even people nearing 60 years of age can still \\"stomp it up\\" with their younger peers in the industry if need be...and even do it better. No generation gap here.  <br /> <br />If I had a down side to the album, I would have liked to see another radio friendly track added in addition to \\"Lost Without You\\" and \\"We Play The Game\\" (the track where Alan sings lead). It's sad current top 40 radio seems so hostile to the classic rock generation. I fear most PDs and music directors won't even give this a listen, in fear of the wrath of their \\"consultants.\\"  <br /> <br />All in all, worth adding to the Parsons collection, even though electronica isn't my general cup of tea.
B00063MBU8|5.0|It's simple really. If you're a fan of Simple Plan, you will appreciate how they have grown musically and lyrically, and you will love this album. If you didn't like Simple Plan before, you're probably not going to like them now. I think this album is amazing, definitely as good as their sophomore album, but better in some ways. I think this album is more punk/rock then the previous album, which was very pop punk.  <br /> <br />1. Shut Up! - This is the song that you will be singing for weeks after you hear it. The chorus is simple yet incredibly catchy. I really like this song because of the upbeat music, and the feel-good lyrics. It's a good song to listen to if you are dealing with people who think they're better then you. <br /> <br />2. Welcome To My Life - This is the first single off of this c.d., and a well chosen one. It's slightly edgier then what we've heard from Simple Plan before, yet familiar enough that Simple Plan fans aren't going to feel the band has totally changed. I love this song. I think that so many people can relate to it. And although some people seem to be of the opinion that teenagers have only artificial problems to deal with, some of us have had to deal with the real issues. This song really reaches out to those of us who have literally been alone and left out. <br /> <br />3. Perfect World - Very nice song, not one of my favourites, though I'm not sure why. Good lyrics though, and very well sung. A little harder then most S.P songs, but in a very good way.  <br /> <br />4. Thank You - This is very familiar territory. This song reminds me a lot of songs from S.P's first c.d., but again with a bit more edge.  <br /> <br />5. Me Against The World - This is one of the songs on the album that I didn't particularly like. The music didn't really appeal to me. However, I think this song will really appeal to those who feel that they have to prove something to the world. <br /> <br />6. Crazy - I absolutely love this song. This is definitely one of the best songs on the album. I really agree with the lyrics of the song. This is why I love Simple Plan, because they often sing about real issues in the world that people, especially teenagers, can relate to (Perfect, Welcome To My Life, Crazy) <br /> <br />7. Jump - This is just a very upbeat feel-good song. It's just one of those songs that makes you want to do exactly what it says, jump. If you don't like S.P, you'll probably want to puke...but then that's your problem.  <br /> <br />8. Everytime - This is my favourite song on this album. I think it's a really beautiful song, very emo like. I really hope this becomes a single, because I think it will be very successful. If you're not sure about this album, I would definitely recommend listening to this song. Even if you don't like S.P you will probably enjoy this song. <br /> <br />9. Promise - This is another upbeat feel-good song. I like it, but I don't listen to it too much. <br /> <br />10. One - This is another really good song on this album. The music and the lyrics are (in my opinion) inspirational and motivational. Very good song, could be another good single, I'd love to see a video for this song. <br /> <br />11. Untitled - This is an amazing song. I love this song, it seems a shame that it's untitled. It's very emotional, and a very powerful song. I would rank it up there with Something Corporate's \\"Konstantine\\", and that is saying something for me because that song is hands down the best emo song ever in existence.  <br /> <br />So, to sum up. Buy this album if you're an S.P fan. If you're not, give a listen to \\"Everytime, One, Crazy, and/or Untitled. Check it out and see if you like it. The boys have definitely grown with this album.
0385335482|2.0|Unless you read this as total fiction, or you have no sense of decency, you'll absolutely loathe the main character. Becky starts out being kinda funny with all her justifications. She does try to be nice, but at her core, she's vacuous and self-centred: only child, presumably shielded from having to learn from her mistakes in youth, she just keeps doing stupid things. If you read it a bit at a time, it doesn't get too much, and you can feel sorry for her and kinda like her. If you read this book quickly or in big chunks, you'll just end up thinking that she's an enormous jerk who deserves to be sent to prison and beaten to death with an inexpensive plimsole for having no sense of responsibility, no sense that she's making other peoples' lives harder, utter arrogance, and utter lack of remorse. If you knew her in real life, you'd want to push her off a building, but if you look at her as a characature, she's more bearable.
B00066J1RG|2.0|Kylie Monogue is one of those artists that make you a bit fearful to admit you're Australian. Depending on the company you keep, you'll either be - <br />a. Forced into a discussion on her work which the person you're talking to thinks is magnificnet, or <br />b. laughed at. <br /> <br />So let's cut to the chase. Kylie is a former soap-star who has had a far longer musical career than she has deserved, and thirty-three tracks is a little too much to stomach. There are some okay moments on here, but they're few and far between, and in all honesty even they aren't all that crash hot. The only standout I would be able to pick is \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow\\" (what did you expect?) and that's more due to Nick Cave's participation, so... <br /> <br />Kylie Monogue has a good voice. It's a pity that the majority of songs on this massive retrospective fail to utilise it. And that the majority of them are actually just crap songs. Consider this an amazing look back on a career of wasted potential. By all means, if you're a Kylie fan or like manufactured pop, then knock yourself out. But I think Kylie's probably past the point where she's going to earn herslef any new fans.
B00068IOWC|5.0|Although I have read a few reviews stating \\"atomic bomb\\" is not what was expected, this is a very clever piece of work. I especially enjoyed \\"sometimes you can't make it on your own\\" after watching the documentary and learning the origin of the song. It hit pretty close to home.  Also, \\"city of blinding lights\\" is a fantastic song.  All in all, I am very pleased with the CD and am looking forward to seeing U2 in concert promoting this CD.
B000687M48|5.0|As it is Evanescence's 1st DVD, I found it very good, and I really enjoyed the live show, but it's kind of boring, because the stage is too simple, and there isn't any exciting moment in the show, and I gave it 5 stars because of the concert and the special features, all combinated, because it has very nice special features; all the videos, a 57min. behind-the-scenes footage and a hidden preformance of \\"Bring Me To Life\\", that I discovered about 1 month after I bought the DVD, and it is so cool, and it's very exciting and fun to look for it, and if you haven't found it yet, it's in one of the menus...<br />And I also gave it 5 stars because of the CD, and the 14 track \\"Missing\\". BUT one thing I didn't like was that it only has 13 live songs, and they didn't even sang all the songs from the album, but they missed just one: \\"Hello\\".<br />If you are Evanescence super fan, buy it. But if you're starting to be one, you'd better like to wait.
068987474X|5.0|I'm in a relationship, but bought this book anyways because my mom saw it on Oprah and was raving about it. I think it's best to read this book when you are completely single and not dating anyone. Because if you are dating, then this book can be kind of sad because you may realize that he's just not that into you. But if you read it when you are single, then you will see the signs as they come and won't invest so many feelings. This book is an eye opener and has some really funny, yet enpowering lines. I am really enjoying it. It's an easy read. I highly recommend it.
0446677450|5.0|In the last two years I have read 20 or so books about money and this one, even with its cheesy cover art and lack of specific advice, is the most important. <br /> <br />It is the only book about money I have lent to non-financially minded friends that has been read. This book can set the financial layman on a path to financial literacy. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki, unlike any other author, has a gift for changing the way people think about money. I am 27 years old now and have been acquiring assets for about 3 years. I don't make alot of money but thanks to Kiyosaki, I am on my way to becoming financially independent well before I am an old man. <br /> <br />The book gives the #1 secret of the rich: They know the difference between an asset and a liability and acquire assets. You may recognize the wisdom of that statement but don't deprive yourself the experience of reading this book and completely understanding how profound this truth is!
B000669GAI|5.0|Obviously this is only my humble opinion, but, YOU ARE A HUGE NERD.  Obviously you have no musical sense whatsoever and feel it is ok to praise that garbage you listed, while knocking arguably the best band of the last 15 years.  Pearl Jam has outlasted Nirvana and Creed and will outlast all those other cheap Pearl Jam knock-offs you chose to include as part of your review.  You wouldn't know good music if it skeeted on your face.  With the exception of Nirvana (which is still extremely overrated in my opinion), you have probably the worst music taste I could imagine.  You should probably start listening to Li'l John and the Yin-Yang Twins if you wish to cover the worst of both rock and rap.  Take it sleazy. <br /> <br />P.S. For the real Pearl Jam fans who like rap too, check out M.F. Doom.  He's the best rapper I've ever heard.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|_Van Helsing_ is a decent action/horror movie about a monster hunter who must travel to Transylvania to meet Dracula and his minions.  If you enjoyed _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ you might enjoy this, because both feature the same Mr. Hyde character (who appears briefly at the beginning of this movie).  Kate Beckinsale, as always, is just swell as the Transylvanian princess.  The movie isn't anything heady but it is good fun.  Enjoy!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Enter Franz Ferdinand, part indie rock like the Strokes and Interpol, part New Wave like Talking Heads and Blondie.  Franz Ferdinand have managed to create some extremely catchy and fun music.  They have rediscoverd the power of a driving bass line and simple guitar leads, delivering hooks, sometimes more than one in a single song, that leave you dancing in front of your bedroom mirror and strumming your air guitar.   <br /> <br />But like I said, it still has its flaws.  Front man Alex Kaprano's vocals don't really stick out.  Many times his vocals and the music don't compliment each other, well they go well together, but the music will over power the vocals when they should just be complimenting each other.  The lyrics are somewhat lacking as well.  Yes they deliver emotion, and they are somewhat insightful, but they are very repetitive.  But I guess this is a good thing if you want radio play, after listening to \\"Take Me Out\\" of \\"40 ft\\" you'll catch yourself singing the same line over and over and over. <br /> <br />So pretty much Franz Ferdinand has all the tools it takes to make a catchy album; great hooks, driving bass, simple melodic guitars, and lyrics that bore themselves into your head.  If you purchase this cd you won't regret it, you'll probably put it into constant rotation in you cd player.  And it will probably stay there for at least as long as all this indie-rock hype is still around.  I'm excited to see if this album will survive the test of time, and even more interested in what the next Franz Ferdinand release could bring.
0671015206|3.0|Thomas Stanley and William Danko teach the average American about the elusive habits of the wealthy upper-class in The Millionaire Next Door.   Although they didn't tell me anything I felt like I didn't already know, I appreciated that they conducted research and presented hard data that backup up the intuition about the wealthy.   <br /> <br />You should guess that small business owners compose the largest group of millionaires in America.  Also, it has always been obvious to me that the people who save and invest their money are far wealthier than those who consume.  Stanley and Danko over-simplify that assumption.  The perception that big spenders are also rich isn't wrong, as Stanley and Danko somewhat mildly point out.  When anyone understands the difference between income and wealth-not too difficult of a concept-then a clear springboard is that people who spend their money on consumable goods are not consistently wealthy.   That is, of course, unless they make ridiculous amounts of income and can still save a significant amount while spending more in one year than I will make in a lifetime.  This point shouldn't be undervalued.  There are significant amounts of millionaires that do spend their money - they have high income, high wealth, and high consumption.  Stanley and Danko do explain the majority of millionaire's habits, as an average.  But remember that there still are 46% of millionaires who drive a car newer than two years old.   <br /> <br />I have been interested in personal finance for years, which is why I appreciated reading a book full of reputable data extracted from university research projects.   While working as an intern financial advisor for UBS (the large Swiss bank) I was able to look into a few of the habits of the wealthy (one million or more of net worth excluding real estate).  And  I found that they were heavy savers and not necessarily big income earners.   <br /> <br />The book is insightful, and it has reiterated and confirmed some important concepts that I have thought about in the past.  One concept that was new to me was how damaging \\"economic outpatient care\\" is to families and the financial independence of rich kids.  It seems a good idea for parents to help their kids out, but it usually is damaging.  Rich kids need to learn to live within their means before getting economic outpatient care.  In addition, I didn't know what careers wealthy parents push their kids into.  It makes sense after Stanley and Danko explain it, but it was still surprising that they tell them to be Accountants, Dentists, Lawyers, Doctors, etc.  It seems like wealthy parents would want to encourage their kids to be entrepreneurs instead, which is where the \\"real money\\" is.  But because the risk of earning real money is high, they want their kids to have consistent streams of income.  Especially considering the ability the parents have to pay for expensive graduate education. <br /> <br />I grew up in a wealthy area of Orange County, California.  Many of my friends' parents were big spenders.  But I learned important lessons when I found that some of the seemingly more wealthy families turned out to be in financial distress.  Big spending doesn't mean big bank accounts-they are inversely proportional. <br />
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing Yo Yo Ma in concert here in the U.S. when he was a relative newcomer in the classical world. I was a little girl and I sat in that symphony hall and cried as I watched a man and his instrument become one.  <br /> <br />I have not had that sort of emotional response to anything Ma has done since that time, no matter how wonderful and perfect his playing is. That being said, this album made me cry like a baby. In the store. Yes, in public. The level of emotional perfection and purity in Ma's intonality - the gentle caress of each note is simply unmatched. And as other reviewers have already stated, the entire album is consistent.  <br /> <br />Yo Yo Ma aside for a moment, I was already fan of some of the pieces on this album before hearing Ma's interpretation. Being familiar with them, I really wondered about their adaptibility to cello performance. What surprised me is that not only does every piece chosen work - but they outdo their original and marvelous construction. Yo Yo Ma has raised the level of Morricone's compositions to heights that a Morricone fan would not have ever believed possible. As a result, you will appreciate both of these artists more for what each has done for the other. <br /> <br />If I could only own one album by Yo Yo Ma, this, folks, would be it.
0060730552|3.0|Twenty years ago in the Peruvian Andes two men set out to conquer a seemingly unconquerable foe.  The West Face of Siula Grande had never before been climbed; Joe Simpson and Simon Yates planned to rectify that.   The details of their adventure are well documented in Joe's book, Touching the Void.  As its cliches title implies, Joe Simpson found himself in a hopeless death trap, the belly of a glacier chasm starving and injured.  What follows you will have to find out for yourself.    The main problem with books of survival stories is that the protagonists are not experienced writers.  So the survivor has two options: either learn how to write or hire a biographer.  Joe decided to learn how to write.  It is obvious that Touching the Void is Simpson's first book-with simple sentences, cliches and forced character development.  But emotional connection is the advantage of having an author-protagonist writing autobiographical events.  Joe is able to relate his passion and fear better than a hired author would.  Emotionally realistic and rough around the edges, that is what Joe's first book became.      One more inherently difficult task that Joe faced was to express in words the very technical, sticky predicaments he crawled out of.  It is hard to explain how traversing one cornice was extraordinary difficult or why a particular 15-foot section of ice climbing taxed his body more than any others.  It takes way too many words to properly describe the terrain; the reader has a hard time following what really is happening.  I found this problem when I wrote a miniature survival story of my own (a 17-year old climbing quandary with a young friend).  It took me hours to accurately describe the climb and why one particular rock face was more perilous than the others-and then in the revision I took it out because others told me the description was too confusing and superfluous.  Joe had a hard task.    It is this intrinsic pitfall that leads me to recommend the movie over thebook.  The documentary from IFC with the same name reenacts most of the scenes with complicated climbing dangers, and leaves you gasping for breath at the end.
0375507256|5.0|While awards are for some guides as to which books to read, for others they can serve as a warning that the novels are \\"too literary\\", all art and artifice and no story.  Witness the recent dust-up over the National Book Awards.  It's easy to see how some might think the same of Cloud Atlas.  Nominated for several awards, including  the heavyweight Booker prize, written by an author known for his \\"literariness\\", and constructed in a non-linear fashion, the novel runs the risk of being ruled out at the outset by many.  That would be too bad, however, for the book is a perfect example of how craft and storytelling are not mutually exclusive. <br />   The structure, as mentioned, is unusual, taking the form of six stories linked mostly if not solely by theme and told in chronological order.  That isn't all, however.  Each story is abruptly interrupted by the one following, until one reaches the middle of the book and the sixth story, after which the stories are completed in reverse order.  The form sounds much more gimmicky than it reads (and serves a purpose beyond the gimmicky) and is not at all difficult to follow.    The structure is part of the book's pleasure, offering up the simple pleasures of varied story/style and cliffhanger endings, along with the more complex pleasure involved in tracing the connections wending between all the stories. <br />  The stories span centuries, styles, and genres.  They are told as diaries, as letters, as interrogation; they are set in the 19th, 20th, and 22nd centuries; they mimic the style of mystery, science-fiction, travelogue.  They all share strong characters, strong voices, a sense of humor and one of sorrow.  They can be equally funny and poignant.  As one might expect when there are six separate stories, some are perhaps stronger than others, but that is more testament to any single story's strength rather than indictment of any story's weakness. Even then, the differences between them are slight and it wouldn't surprise me if readers disagreed about which are the better ones.  Each is in its own right a compelling, well-told story, though all are improved upon and deepened by the connections between them. If there is any slowing in the book, it probably will come in the most futuristic story, which is told in a stylized slang that simply because of its unfamiliarity will cause more reading difficulty than the previous stories.  That said, it is not all that difficult (there is, for instance, no need of a glossary as in Clockwork Orange) to follow, it gets easier as one reads it, and the story shares the same strengths of character and plot with the others, making the extra work (little as it is) well worth it. <br />  Cloud Atlas is a thoroughly enjoyable read on many, many levels.  People who pick it up for its pedigree of awards and past authorial history might be surprised by the genre aspect (\\"how did I end up reading science fiction?\\").  People who pick it up despite rather than because of its pedigree might be surprised by its accessibility, by the compelling nature of the various plots.  In either case, it will be a pleasant surprise for both. Highly and strongly recommended.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2's latest effort appears to be heading in a new direction.  Whether that's good or not, we don't yet know.  After their last several releases, they seemed to be floundering without direction.  No, \\"How to Dismantle . . .\\" is NOT the old U2.  How many of us are the same way we were in the 70's and 80's?  After listening to this album many times, I am beginning to hear something new and different.  It still sounds like U2, but there are fresh ideas, new riffs, and a new kind of writing that I hope will continue in future recordings.  I'm sure glad they're doing more than touring around the country playing \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" over and over and over.
B0000041LL|3.0|As you wend your way through the tangled forest of reviews concerning the various Beethoven String Quartet recordings, your head is undoubtably spinning like a rotisserie as you read this.<br /><br />  Don't worry, I have the answers.  There is NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, who has logged more time comparing Beethoven quartet performances than I have, and here are the results in a nutshell.<br /><br />  There are 2 opposite ends of the spectrum: On one end there is the Quartetto Italiano, which tends towards slower tempos, and consequently their slow movements come off as deeply moving (the cavatina, Opus 130 is exquisite). Their polar opposite is the Emerson Quartet, which plays way too fast, but for movements that call for lightning speed they are unmatched in excitement. Although each quartet has it's strengths, overall they fall short. There are a lot of quartets that fall somewhere in the middle, and are worth checking out.<br /><br />  Try the Cleveland Quartet for a happy medium. Excitement and depth work hand in hand.  But for the the very best recording available, on the whole, try the Berg Quartet. They nearly equal the Italians in depth of feeling and likewise throw down a serious challenge to the Emerson for sheer hair-raising excitement. You can buy their complete Beethoven set for only $25, which is an added bonus.<br /><br />Of course, ideally you  should have several versions, and for this reason I recommend the Quartetto Italiano, even though it's not the best version, in my opinion. Try their Debussy and Ravel string quartets to really hear them shine.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|I really went into this movie expecting to like it a lot more than I actually did. I am such a huge fan of Will Ferrell from his \\"SNL\\" days. And I just happen to love Christmas movies! I even like Jon Favreau, who directed the movie. But watching it, I began to realize that the movie is just simply \\"missing\\" something. Ferrell is funny enough, but just so. There are a few scenes that made me laugh out loud, but I was expecting to laugh a lot more often. Some of the situations just feel \\"forced\\". Plus, I just never cared about some of the characters in the movie. Overall, I was left feeling a bit let-down after viewing this one, especially since I'm such a big fan of the star and director.
B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie is funny as hell. It wasn't meant to be a comedy, and I went to Ryder's house as a comic fan expecting to see a serious adaptation of the comic books. What I got instead was a 1950s B-Movie mockery of a riddle. There's a scene in this movie where Hulk is locked up and talking to his dad. His dad all of a sudden starts ranting about how the military is conquering everything in its path, which had nothing to do with anything. While he's talking, Banner starts screaming for no apparent reason. I laughed my ass off during that scene. It was funny man. Not as funny as when me and Ryder tried to copy the scene from Spiderman, but all we had was silly string, and Ryder fell down and smashed up his XBOX, I was laughing my ass off, and his head was bleeding all over. Damn, that was a funny day. <br />
B0000DJZA5|5.0|With the Beatles catalog being recycled in so many ways, this was bound to happen.  Too bad it took so long.  I am a huge fan and always found the Let It Be album to feel somehow out if place in the Beatles catalog.  Somehow the sound and feel of it wasn't right.  Now, placing this in the order where it belongs - before Abbey Road - it fits and it feels good.    Another reason this CD is worthwhile is the remixing and remastering.  Like Yellow Submarine before it (which also sounds great), the update adds new life to the songs.  PLEASE remix the rest of the catalog!  And give us real stereo versions of the first four albums, my British LP's are wearing out (maybe the Capitol versions will work?).    Now let's get the movie out on DVD.  Hopefully there will be added scenes.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Ok. My \\"review\\" probably won't sound as intelligent as other's, but this is why I'm not a writer. Pitchfork did in fact give it a 9.7 rating, and I can clearly see why. This band has to be my new favorite. Every time I listen to the album, it seems to get better and better. I saw them perform live two days ago, and I'm still on a high. They burst to life and give it their all on stage. Even with broken guitar strings and drum sticks, they continue playing. It was really intense. Everyone, do yourself a favor and listen to them.
0440238609|2.0|I am an avid teenage reader, and any time I get ahold of a new fantasy book that I have not read, I snap it up.  That being said, I will mention that I am also a Christian....and I am enjoying J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series immensely.  <br /> <br />Mr. Pullman creates a very intriguing world.  His armored bears, alternate universes and daemons are intriguing.  The alethiometer, the dust, the subtle knife are all fascinating and original in a world weary of Tolkin re-makes.  The main characters, Lyra and Will, are for the most part well written.  The story itself seems creative:  Lyra is a young girl who lives in Jordan College in the Oxford of an alternate universe that is both like and unlike our own.  She accidentally gets caught up in the exploration and research of \\"dust\\", a strange substance that does even stranger things, when her best friend is kidnapped by the very people somehow involved with the dust.  From there, the books go on to chronicle the adventures of herself and Will, a boy from our own dimension who gets caught up in the plot, and who is the bearer of the Subtle Knife, a knife that can cut through the very fabric of different worlds and into others.   <br /> <br />When I first started the series, I noticed a possible anti-Christian slant, but I didn't pay it too much attention, because I was really enjoying the books, and I didn't have anything else to read.  This slant became more apparent in the second book, but again I shrugged it off.  In the third book, I kept thinking that surely Mr. Pullman was not saying what it appeared that he was saying, and that some last minute twist would change the direction that the series appeared to be careening headlong into.  As I read the final page, I found this wasn't the case.  I don't know exactly what Mr. Pullman has against Christianity, but I have trouble with his disguising it in children's literature.  If I went by his opinions, the church would be a terrible, evil oppressor of all that is good,sin would be a hallucination of the church, and God Himself would be a decrepit old man who is too weak to even take care of Himself.  Anyone with a Christian perspective is likely to find this beyond offensive. <br /> <br />If you don't have a problem with any of this, you are likely to enjoy this series very much.  It is original and well-written.  It is also going to remain on my bookshelf, gathering dust and cobwebs until kingdom come.  Will you read it?  The choice is yours to make.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I already own the trilogy and won't be buying this one even though the trasnfer suppose to be much better. The next version I'm buying will the the HD version that will be released in a couple of years. Why waste money on this one when it obviously can't measure up to HD?<br /><br />Take my advice, if you already own the original discs, save your money for the HD version.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What makes a person decide to rave about an album 7 years after buying it. I have not just started to like this...although I hated it first time around, and that is sometimes a good sign. If something is so different and leftfield you probably wont like it until a few listens. Umpteen billion listens later it gets better and better every time. Layers and layers of strings, synths, backbeats, clicks and whirrs and Thom Yorke's joyous/painful voice render the 12 songs here as essential in my house as a stove and water. This is the best music can be: emotional, enjoyable and 53 minutes and 27 seconds of escape. If you dont like it nobody cares. If you have not heard it - and I guess that is why you would be reading a review - I envy you because you have at least 7 years of listening bliss ahead of you.
0064471837|5.0|I am a big fan of fantasy and read a lot of it. After a while, so many of them run together; they all seem to have a similar plot line, similar magical insturments ect... Not so with Sabriel. Garth Nix weaves an entirely original tale set in an entirely original land. I thouroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend the entire series.
0440238609|5.0|Amazingly, each book is better than the last. His characters are so rich and complex, that they almost become real. I haven't been this deeply moved by a book in a long time.
0972169504|5.0|Piled Higher and Deeper helped me get through graduate school. They say depressed people make the best comedians -- and who is more depressed than the average grad student? <br /> <br />There are many rolling-on-the-floor hilarious moments, but for the most part Ph.D. is more of a gentle tease on grad school, which is often just the sort of thing you need when you start taking the difficulties of grad school a little too seriously. <br /> <br />(Oh, and yes, I did finish my Ph.D., in philosophy, and am now happily employed. I still read Ph.D. every week.)
B00005JN4O|5.0|I have never cried as many times watching a movie as I did tonight.  I left the movie's feeling almost revived - and thankful.  See this movie, please.  I can truely say that I have a new outlook on life following viewing such a masterpiece.
B0002CTQYW|4.0|I first became acquainted with this movie a year or two ago by randomly picking the first movie I saw in the store, renting it, and running out. Judging by the title (\\"The Dinner Game in the English edition, but \\"Diner de cons\\" in French, meaning something along the lines of \\"Dinner of the Asses\\") it sounded like something that would turn out to be mildly funny and realatively plotless. I'm still not sure if I was right or not, either way. The general idea is that a group of friends gets together weekly to make fun of an idiot they invite. The main character throws out his back and his wife runs away, all immediately before his chosen idiot shows up. Pignon, the idiot, makes sometimes funny mistakes, but still doesn't manage to find out that he is the idiot. I won't tell you the end, though it's not some huge thing.. But one must watch at least the scene when they add vinegar to the wine.
B00064AM6C|5.0|this is a great concert from the white stripes.

B00006690G|2.0|There's nothing wrong with a spot of harmless debate about such casual issues as animal molestation and the odd bit of homophobia!  <br /> <br />Only problem listening to this Eminem lad, is he started off somewhat sensible, and then proceeded to warble on incoherently about why it is that we should all **** off.  <br /> <br />He's a right old BUNDLE of fun...
0312335164|2.0|Give Dan Brown a B plus for this effort.  Pretty interesting premise:  The National Security Agency (NSA) controls all the top-secret national data from sub launch codes to NASA satellite control systems.  Somehow this data must be safeguarded, and the NSA has put Commander Strathmore on the front line of defense.  His ingeniously built TRANSLTR system is housed in a high-tech atrium of Hollywood proportions, and runs day and night unencrypting messages from the bad guys.  Is it also right that these mysterious feds snoop into the emails and bank accounts of law abiding citizens?  Some groups like the Electronics Frontier Foundation (EFF) don't think so.  Neither does brilliant Japanese programer Ensei Tankado who concocts an involved plan to counteract TRANSLTR and free the world of \\"Big Brother.\\"  Thereby  enabling safer communications for all drug lords, terrorists and other global evil doers.  (Written pre-9/11, there are no references to more current evil doers.)<br /><br />Into the breach step hero and heroine, David Becker and Susan Fletcher, a mild mannered Lord Jeff of a college language professor and his brilliant cryptographer girlfriend.  If they don't somehow escape near death on every page to foil the bad guys and save the world, who will?<br /><br />Therein is the chief shortcoming.  We already know the ending.  The yarn has good potential, but drags along through B-movie chase sequences and ho-hum plot twists that are pretty obvious.  Will the black hat catch the white hat? (And naturally our hero IS wearing a white jacket.)  Will she believe this good guy or that bad guy (or vice versa)?  \\"HE did it!\\"  \\"No, HE did it!\\" Yawn.  Both DAVINCI CODE and DECEPTION POINT were better.<br /><br />Of course, it beats watching old NHL reruns. And we learn how to write in secret code!  (...)
B00000I8UK|5.0|I have to admit my jazz collection is quite slim and most of it predates the 1950's but I love the music on 'Out To Lunch'. Like others have contested, this is not free-jazz, much of the music opens with a melody line no matter how angular and dissonant before each member gets a chance to improvise. The opening 'Hat and Beard' (a tribute to Thelonious Monk) sets the tone for the rest of the album, the track roots itself in its synchopated beginning before leaping off into some interesting solos including a great one by vibist Bobby Hutcherson. Rhythm section Davis and Williams aren't so 'free' here maintaining an elegant groove. On 'Something Sweet, Something Tender', Hubbard sounds almost conservative, his playing evoking memories of 50's bop. There's some wonderful improvised bass by Richard Davis (also heard on Van Morrison's criticaly acclaimed 'Astral Weeks') and then Dolphy enters flouting all his exhuberance on clarinet. 'Gazzelloni' begins like the movie theme from an architypal 60's film, with a foot-tapping rhythm that again challenges the notion that this is a free-jazz album. There's some remarkable interplay between Hutcherson and Williams as they flow behind Dolphy's flute and Hubbard's trumpet. Hubbard comes to the fore again on 'Out To Lunch' where his trumpet runs like a bumble bee after Dolphy's bird-flying alto-sax solo. For a moment the rhythm breaks into a pounding monotone, then a bass flourish before the drums take us back to the original melody. Then comes the final drunken swagger of 'Straight Up And Down' where Hubbard's playing is almost conventional above the rhythm section indulging themselves, while Hutcherson goes on another flamboyant run, demonstrating what this album encapsulates most, an unrestrained sense of playfulness.
0679720200|5.0|If some of the other reviews metion this work as \\"Masterful\\" and as \\"a character study\\", that is true. The first thing you could think of after completing this book is: \\"What a character!\\"  Meursault is quiet a creation. He begins and remains a man unaffected by life and the genius of Camus lies in presenting this authentically. Even as he is enjoying a holiday at a beach nothing, beyond the fulfillment of the moment, can give Meursault any satisfaction, nothing seems to affect him. Reading this I am reminded of Dostoevsky's Underground man and Kafka's K., from his  \\"the trial\\". With this story Camus takes a step further from Dostoevsky and Franz Kafka. Unlike K., Meursault is prosecuted for a crime that is clear, but the feeling of a man against the system remains. You do feel that he has been given a raw deal but even so somehow his fate seems for the better. Meursault himself shows some affectedness towards the end, but quickly reconciles himself. Here we have a glimpse of the process of his character formation, someone who looks at death as an inevitable consequence and hence reconciles to his fate without complaining. This is novel at its best as an art form, it is interesting and it is food for thought. You are interested in his fate as the judge hands out his sentence to Meursault and then later, much  <br />later, you wonder about the person, his philosophy and its effect.
6305882592|5.0|Harold is a strange young man. He is obssessed with death and dark things, reacting to his mother's attempts to socialize him and get him dates through a bizarre series of faked suicide attempts. He goes to funerals for fun, and he seems the original goth, dressing in black at all times and driving a hearse. <br /> <br />Maude is in her early 80s, a concentration camp survivor, and a woman who embraces each day as though it were her last. She has a positive philosophy about life, and one that thumbs its nose at the establishment, unoriginal thinking, and permanence. <br /> <br />The two are a very unlikely pair, but Harold and Maude somehow find one another and share a very real and pure romance that brings the 19 year old out of his dark shell and shows him how to live. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is all Cat Stevens and awesome. The scenes involving Harold and his mother are hilarious. The the looks they exchange are enough to get a person rolling on the floor. The chemistry between this young man and older woman challenges any in Hollywood before or since.  <br /> <br />This movie is a must see for anyone that likes a more cerebral dark comedy, and Maude's life lessons can be a benefit to anyone that bothers to look deeply enough into them.
068987474X|4.0|I think this book is very insightful. It also confirms many ideas and thoughts with what I learned from Dr. John Gray's books. I think they both have been very helpful. However, I'm still curious about how guys will review this book and how they feel. Any guys who read this book? Please raise up your hands. Thank you.  <br /> <br />
B00003CX95|3.0|I like this movie. The acting was superb, the battle scenes were graphic without being overly grotesque, and the story itself was compelling.  <br /> <br />But it would have been more compelling if it were based more closely on the true William Wallace's struggle for Scottish independence and the events surrounding him in his time and place. After all, the true historical events are like a movie in themselves. <br /> <br />Inaccuracy can be forgiven in cinema on certain levels. This is a long movie that has a lot to relate to the viewer about the people that were there to play out this drama centuries ago. There is a lot of build up, from the death of Wallace's wife at the hands of the British, to the wiping out of his village, and the abuses that the Scots were suffering from their neighbors to the south. There is also a lot of political intrigue, and it is difficult to put that on the screen because political intrigue, especially in medieval Europe, was a complicated business. So in this, inaccuracies that spell out the plight of the Scots and build up to the actual events and battles would be forgivable, and they are. <br /> <br />However, one glaring and unecessary inaccuracy dropped this movie down to the 3 star rating all on its own.  William Wallace never - I repeat, NEVER, slept with Queen Isabela. He probably never actually even stood in the same room with her. Yes, she had lovers, and one in particular actually later helped her murder her gay husband in grisly fashion with a red hot poker in a certain orifice. But she never even knew Wallace, and chances are that if she had, she would never give it up to an unwashed Scot.  <br /> <br />It was totally needless and it did nothing for the plot. It also serves to confuse the viewer that expects this movie to be more historically accurate. Little flaws are all right if they are helping to move the movie along and do not compromise the story.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, this is a great movie, and if you take it asbeing a Hollywood account with only minimal basis in reality, you would give it a 5 star rating. If you are a history buff, you wouldn't give it a 5 and keep a clear conscience. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Ok, so can anyone picture anyone else playing Napoleon?  Nope, I can't either.  The man deserves a nod for Best Actor.  I'm not joking.  Johnny Depp can act like Keith Richards and get a nod then why can't John Heder act totally out of it and get a nod.  This is truly a piece of actors work here.  Some may laugh it off, but can you see anyone else being able to pull that off?  Nope.  <br /> <br />Best actor.
B000002JPA|5.0|What is with these kids saying \\"OMG Avril Lavigne is best guitar playa eva!\\" learn the fact. SHE DIDN'T EVEN LEARN HOW TO READ MUSIC. Can you say stupid? Hell, I'm a better guitarist than her. And I know how to read music. Just because Dream Theater is too complicated and the songs are too long for your attention span does not give you the right to knock them off as no-talent losers. Go back and listen to your mainstream music. <br /> <br />As for this album, it is definitely one of Dream Theater's best albums, next to Scenes From A Memory. <br /> <br />Pull Me Under: 9/10 <br />This is a dark song, with an equally dark video. BIG MTV hit, which helped them become famous. Without it, this band might have never gotten to the highest of prog-rock masters. Though the song is not the best (close though), it is good. <br /> <br />Another Day: 9/10 <br />Little to much \\"cheese\\" factor on this one. The lyrics are good, kinda girly, but the music is so good. The saxophone or whatever here is awesome. Song is one of the best, but ruined by cheese factor. <br /> <br />Take The Time: 8/10 <br />This was my favorite song on first listen, but after a few listens it quickly loses its luster. The beat grows tiresome and the lyrics are kind of wierd. Good song though. <br /> <br />Surrounded: 9/10 <br />This song, like Another Day, suffers from cheesy lyrics and James LaBrie's girly voice. However, I find myself listening to this one a little too often. <br /> <br />Metropolis Pt. 1: 10/10 <br />I give this song a 10/10 alone because it spawned the best Dream Theater album ever, \\"Scenes From A Memory\\". One or two minutes too long, but it is such a complex and beautiful song. <br /> <br />Under A Glass Moon: 6/10 <br />Pales in comparison to the other songs. It is very good indeed, but I don't find myself listening to this one a lot. One of their heavier ones on the album. <br /> <br />Wait For Sleep: 8/10 <br />2:31 seconds long is kind of a bummer, but it's just a filler really. <br /> <br />Learning To Live: 9/10 <br />An epic song that lasts eleven and a half minutes. Heavy, melodic and just an overall good song. It ends the album with a giant bang. People with no patience and/or critics of self-indulgence should look elsewhere. Go away Linkin park fans. <br /> <br />Total: 68/80 <br /> <br />OVERALL: 9/10 :::: 4.5/10 <br /> <br />Great album, some of the best prog-rock/metal you can find. If you are new to Dream Theater, I think this and Scenes From A Memory are the albums to start out with. It's just so good.
B000002UA0|5.0|TAKE UP THY ACID PILL AND TRIP!!! THIS IS A GREAT ESCAPE ALBUM BECAUSE IT GETS AWAY FROM THE BS OF THE REAL WORLD. IT'S LIKE YOU ARE HIGH ON LSD BUT YOUR IN NO DANGER BECAUSE IT JUST COMES THROUGH THE MUSIC. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FLOYD FAN..TRUST ME IT'S ONE OF THE BEST!
0385486804|5.0|Having read \\"Into Thin Air\\" last year, I was eager to embark on another journey from Jon Krakauer.  His recounting of an adverturer's ill-fated Alaskan quest is well-researched and beautifully written.  Krakauer is captivating in the way he describes every aspect of McCanless' travels, mindset, and survival through journals and conversations with his family and travel counterparts.  One easily experiences the physical and emotional ebbs and flows he must have encountered along the way.  This book properly unfolds the story and thoughtfully weaves together the many facets of this young man's life.
B000002UAU|4.0|I would like to say that this album is spectacular and has some wonderful songs and can probably be considered the first SUCCESSFUL concept album. I would just like to point to out that at the time The Beatles were working in the studio on this album, Abbey Lane Studios had the originator's of the concept album and the king's of progressive rock in the recording booth over. That band is of course Pink Floyd and at the time, they were most likely recording there debut album on a big label, Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Seeing as the Floyd were about the most psychedelic thing around at the time and that this is right when the Beatles music started to get downright loopy, I'm guessing the friendly bandmates at one time presented The Beatles with the idea of a concept album. I didn't mean to steal any thunder, this is an excellent album and a wise choice to buy. However, when people say it's the best of all time, it scares me. As great as it is, I'd recommend getting Led Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO), The Wall by Pink Floy, or why not even Rumours by Fleetwood Mac before buying Sgt. Pepper. If you are a beginning listner of the band, I would reccomend buying The Beatles 1 before buying this. It might be a little too trippy for the beginner and it might turn you off to the Beatles, why not buy what they are best known for?
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This is a great concert, well produced and filmed, great sound and everything.<BR>But the first disk set I recieved had a defective disk 2, all the tracks played until the last 4 tracks started and then the DVD player froze. This happened on all the DVD players I tried even our computer. Amazon did send a replacement and they were really fast in getting the new disks to us. But the replacement had the same defect in the same spot. I don't think it is just one bad disk, I suspect it is the whole run of disks. I can say - yes get this DVD but only when they fix/ship disks that aren't defective
B0000203Y5|4.0|This is a documentary about the famous musicians who played at the Buena Vista Social Club, which has long disappeared, in pre-revolutionary Havana. Apparently guitarist Ry Cooder decided to execute his plan in the late 90's, what he had conceived while visiting Cuba in the 70's, to make an album with these long forgotten folk artists.      Why were these men (and one woman) forgotten? I suppose the U.S.led effort to isolate Cuba since 1959 has played a role in that which has given the regime an excuse for most of its history to frown upon and repress artistic expression that goes beyond its narrow parameters. The regime has placed supreme emphasis on building an economy separate from the U.S. led capitalist world and attempting to survive in a hostile world instead of encouraging artists.      The film displays the picturesque streets of Havana and their denizens watching the scenery from balconies or doorways, playing dominoes, riding in old cars, busses and motorcycles, with lots of stray dogs, including one defecating in the street. But most of all it shows the Cuban musicians reflecting on their life and, of course, playing their charming folk music.      The climax of the film is the group playing at Carnegie Hall in New York. It is certainly moving to see the look on the face of the old vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer as he gets a standing ovation. Several of them are followed through New York as they tour the sites and express enchantment at the great splendor of the city (\\"Wait till they get mugged,\\" my dad said).      A movie like this is good for it shows the human face of Cuba, instead of Cuba viewed through abstract discussions on socio-political or geo-political theories or through the prism of South Florida half-wits who admire Luis Posada Carrilles and Orlando Bosch. The old men (and the one woman) in it are very charming. Compay Segundo is the oldest one in the movie, about 90, at the time of the shooting. He is also probably the most colorful; he discourses on his cure for hangovers, his love of women and his desire to add a sixth to his five children before he dies. As Anne Louise Bardach mentions in her fine new book \\"Cuba Confidential\\" Segundo tried to play a concert in South Florida in the late 90's but it was disrupted by the usual riots and bomb threats stimulated by talk radio demagogues that happen every time a Cuban musician tries to play in Florida and refuses to defect. As I was impressed with during my visit to the island in January 2004, Cuba is full of people who live, work, play, cry, make love, just like everybody else. It's regime is brutal but it is not North Korea.      The regime seems to have gotten past its cultural Puritanism that devastated Cuba's artistic world during the \\"cultural revolution\\" of the 60's. Hip hop clothing and rap are flourishing in the country; one can see them and all the latest pop music from Latin America at the night clubs. There is more leeway for artists to express themselves.  When I was in Cuba on a school trip, we visited a \\"special\\" high school, a training school for \\"teachers of culture.\\" I can't remember exactly where it was located, but it was full of serious young people. We were treated to a solo vocalist or two and an excellent guitar duet. We saw several excellent music performances from different groups in the rest of our trip. Cuban music is alive and well.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Well, you can really tell who is really informed about the issues in the reviews I have read. The fact is that most people who have bashed this film, have made up their minds without seeing the film first. Sort of like the people who voted for this president. They made up their minds without thinking about the issues. I think this film raises more questions than it does answers. What if Moore is right about Bush? What is the appropriate thing to do? I always love reading the stupid comments made by the Limbaugh idiots, and the right wing religious nut cases, who have no clue, or don't want to look at the real issues. Moore has been a great example of courage! May God keep Michael Moore!
B00005A1VH|5.0|This is one of the nicest film's I have ever seen.  I have no idea why the studios have not put this on DVD given it is likely one of the best creations ever in Hollywood.  Hollywood studios seem almost totally detached from the market they serve.
0375422307|3.0|This is the case of the emperor's new clothes. Personal stories from the Middle East are comparatively few in the U.S. and as this one is in an \\"accessible\\" graphic novel form, everyone is gushing over it. However, the visual storytelling staggers forward and the primitive graphic style makes it hard to distinguish characters and to form a connection with them, especially the girls. If you want to read a compelling, heart-wrenching, as well as educational graphic novel about the Middle East, go to \\"Palestine\\" by Joe Sacco instead.
B000255LNE|5.0|If you're looking for a greatest hits album of Phil Collins, this is not it.  Check out his 1998 \\"Hits\\" album...it has nearly all of them.  However, if you're looking for a compilation of great songs (by Collins and others), check this album out.      Only seven of the 25 tracks presented on this album also appear on \\"Hits\\"...and two of those appear here as live recordings.  The recording of \\"True Colors\\" alone is reason enough to buy this album.  Recorded during Collins' 2004 tour, it is performed with a new arrangement and impressive soprano sax work from Gerald Albright.  A very minor complaint is that a new live recording of \\"One More Night\\" with Albright wasn't included.     Other highlights include a live performance of the classic \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and the single version of \\"Least You Can Do\\", a great ballad from Collins' 2002 album \\"Testify\\".  This album is a little heavy on material from \\"Both Sides\\", but tracks from Collins' first two solo albums provide balance, including the very underappreciated \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\".  The newest track, \\"Tearing and Breaking\\", may seem unimpressive on first listen (it did to me anyway), but the song manages to take hold with a few more listens.    A great collection of tunes for fans of songwriting.
B0006399FS|3.0|Albeit Everything You Can't Leave Behind is a bit pop, it sure is killer pop.  And what's wrong with that?  There isn't a really catchy tune on \\"Bomb\\"...  \\"All that you can't...\\" was a treasure chest of memorable tunes.  You can say what you want about a band's right to artistic license but I'm the one shelling out the bucks for every album and DVD put out and I just don't like it!  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|After releasing several solo albums during the last 25 years, some better than others, Tony Banks has at last found his voice outside of Genesis.  Seven orchestral works of varying moods and tempo are presented here and each track draws on unique melodies, a quality that made Banks a favorite among Genesis fans for so many years.  The musical depth of this suite as a whole was very impressive for a first effort.  Hopefully, this suite will mark a new beginning for a very overlooked songwriter and composer.
068987474X|5.0|This book is great. It's funny, short, sweet, and to the point. It provides information about men that we (women) should already know, but don't really like to acknowledge. I highly recommend this to any woman who is on the dating scene. It's a really quick read and provides some laughs as well. <br />
B00006HAZG|5.0|The first half of David Copperfield was good enough, I think, to please Dickens himself.  This is due in part to the excellent portrayal of young David by Daniel Radcliffe, who provides just the right amount of spunk and vulnerability to do justice to the character.  Treavor Eve is also excellent as David's nemesis, his stepfather, Murdstone.  Just a look from Eve's Murdstone is enough to frighten David first into silence and then, as he is being savagely beaten for failing his lessons,  into instinctive rebellion, biting Murdstone's hand.  For this crime David is sent to Murstone's blacking factory in London.  The blacking factory is a dreadful place and would certainly have broken David's spirit and ruined his life if it were not for the introduction of Mr. Micawber, his guardian in London, exceptionally well played by the talented Bob Hoskins.<br /><br />This great novel is filled with a variety of subplots, many of which are included in the film.  Three that are worth mentioning are David's flight from the blacking factory and his journey to his Aunt Betsey Trotwood, beautifully performed by the great English actress Maggie Smith.  Aunt Betsey takes David in and champions his cause in a dramatic scene where she throws out Murdstone and his sister Jane from her home.  Aunt Betsey then takes David to live with a lawyer and his daughter Agnes and the lawyer's evil clerk Uriah Heep, who pretends to be humble yet never stops scheming to steal everything the lawyer owns.  In another great scene, Macawber, now working for Heap, confronts the villain as a Heap of infamy.  This dramatic encounter is the climax of the film.  Lastly, another story worth mentioning concerns David's nanny Peggotty.  She and her family are betrayed by Steerforth, a boy that befriended David in his first school and who saved him from the dreadful headmaster Mr. Creakle, wonderfully played by Ian McKellen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when David grows up the story loses some of its force and energy.  The adult David, Ciaran McMenamin, is the weakest actor in the cast.  Even so, the story is so well dramatized that I found myself engaged from beginning to end.<br /><br />David Copperfield is a long book and four hours is not quite enough time to do it justice, but what the producers have included is done well and will certainly give viewers a good sense of the exceptionally varied and entertaining cast of characters in a story, somewhat autobiographical, that Dickens himself considered his favorite and best work.  This film is family entertainment of a high order.  Highly recommended.David, Ciaran McMenamin, is the weakest actor in the cast.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is an amazing adult fairy tale filmed by the ever impressive imagination of Tim Burton with several great messages contained within the disguise of an old man's dreams. <br /> <br />Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying but he refuses to leave behind his tall tales about all of the situations he has encountered in his life. His wife (Jessica Lange) remains humored by her husband's fantasy life but is troubled that her son cannot seem to warm up to this extraordinary man. Edward's son Will Bloom (Billy Cudrup) has grown weary of his father's inability to deal with reality and is sick of hearing about oversized fish, perfect Southern towns, spectacular circuses, Siamese twins, glass eyes that see the future, haunted forests and gentle giants who don't exist. But upon returning home for his father's final days Will warms up to the possibility of his father's life as he sees it. With flash backs to Edward's youth (played by Ewan McGregor) all the tales seem come to new life.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful movie that brings an intimacy back to a family torn apart by false hopes and scattered communication. It shows the despair a child experiences when shadowed from the truth and the distance a father creates by telling tall tales hoping to make himself appear more than he seems. But it also shows the ties of a family never quite severed and so close to the core. With brilliant imaginative scenes Tim Burton has created an adult fairy tale for the ages that can appeal to children as well. This is Burton's most mature venture and he rises to the occasion managing to combine sentiment beside fantasy with great ability. At times touching this film also contains a touch of horror and moments of comical relief while maintaining integrity to the original book written by Daniel Wallace. Only Tim Burton could have managed to bring this book to life. For anyone who has experienced that bedside chat with a dying loved one or anyone who wished for those precious moments thismovie will tug at your heart strings and leave you weeping. But in the end what is a tall tale? In a world of differences trying to understand another's reality may seem blurry at times but imagine the possibilities if we allow others to envision our most precious dreams.....Tim Burton opens up that other world so grab your pole and go fishing!   <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 has solidified their place in Music History, this is a fact.  Also, how they continue to evolve and stay a viable force within the ever changing world of music is astounding.  This album will not dissapoint those who have listened to U2 before and it will not dissapoint those who are newly discovering U2. <br /> <br />This album receives 4 stars simply because it is not quite on the scale as \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\".  These are the essential U2 albums that have defined U2 to this point.  However, this album would easily be 5 stars if it were anyone else.  There is a great mixture of fast and slow, hard and soft in this album.  The bottom line is, this album will not dissapoint and I expect the following songs to be on U2's \\"Best of 2000-2010\\" one day: Vertigo, Miracle Drug, Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own and City of Blinding Lights.
0767819659|4.0|Every little girl has wanted to become the incorrigibly adventurous Madeline as introduced by children's writer Ludwig Bemelman and this movie brings her to new life. <br /> <br />Madeline (Hatty Jones) resides in a French orphanage, wears a little blue suit and cap and creates havoc wherever she goes. Help is only a step away with Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) at hand and she rescues little Madeline often and with good cheer. But the orphanage is scheduled to be sold by the owner Lord \\"Cucuface\\" Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) and the girls who live with Madeline devise a plan to save their home. All sorts of antics take place against the backdrop of the beautiful Parisian scenery that surrounds the worried little orphans. <br /> <br />Hatty Jones is really superb as the classically mischievous orphan in blue, Madeline. Hatty has the perfect button nose and red hair to pull off the look but she also manages to capture the impish thoughts of the little character as well. Frances McDormand is highly likable as the Sister who adores her home full of orphans. Nigel Hawthorne pulls off the uppity roll of a wealthy property owner who could care less about the future of a few bratty orphans. But it is the beautiful city of Paris that steals the show, with glimpses of perfection at every corner how could an orphan in Paris ever be sad. No wonder little Madeline has remained such a happy sight for generations of children and adults.     <br />

0743454529|5.0|I thought this book was interesting and thought provoking.  I, too, am the mother of three (thankfully healthy) children and found myself wondering what would I do.  I have read everyone of Jodi Picoults books and found this to be one of the best. I, personally, loved the ending.  Jodi Picoult is known for her unusual twist and turns.  I believe those who critized it missed the point.  In the end, we never really have total control of our bodies.  It is up to God and God alone.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Wow, who'd have thought that after only six years in the business Britney Spears would have enough hit singles to release her first Greatest Hits? Well, okay, I kinda knew it was gonna happen because in those six years I have been a non-stop Britney fan and carefully followed the release of all her songs. After some time they all pile up and you have a pretty impressive list on your hands. Some say the release of this Greatest Hits is a bit premature, and I agree and disagree. On one hand I think it would have been wise to wait another three or four years, but then again you only have to take a look at the amount of world No.1 singles she's racked up and the release of this album doesn't seem so pointless after all.<br /><br />So, Britney Spears. Just the name is enough to bring about feelings of love or hate amongst possibly every single person on the planet. The woman is a worldwide brand. No one else of this decade so far has been as heavily documented, scrutinised or analysed. You can be famous, really famous and then famous on an unparalleled level. Britney belongs in the latter category. Christina could only wish for the exposure that Britney has. Then again, that exposure isn't always a good thing. It can't be healthy when the whole world is talking about your life every single day, but hey, the world is full of jealous people. With about $140 million in the bank at the age of 23 and a gorgeous body, it makes Britney an easy target.<br /><br />What has become lost amongst all of the media fodder that is splashed across the celeb magazines every week is that Britney Spears has released some pretty damn good pop songs. She's not Whitney, Mariah or Aretha, but then she's not meant to be. She is definitely the Madonna of the 21st Century whether you like her or not, it's just a fact that you'll have to live with. She may not be as smart or savvy, but she is an entertainment genius pure and simple. She brings joy to a lot of people and it's not just because of her on-stage presence.<br /><br />This Greatest Hits comprises of all the hits from Britney's four studio albums \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" \\"Britney\\" and \\"In The Zone.\\" The tracks are not in chronological order, and this is evident because the first ten songs are all the best. The European version has 20 tracks whilst the US only has 17. This 2-disc set also has a Limited Edition Bonus Remix disc which features some cool remixes of some of her sexier hits. Her classic debut single \\"Baby One More Time\\" ripped through the music industry in 1999 like a ferocious storm making her the ultimate pin-up of the late 90's. The other two big hits from that debut album were \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" both of which feature here. Britney's second UK No.1 single \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" is also lodged towards the end of the album.<br /><br />That debut album sold a staggering 25 million copies worldwide and became the biggest selling teen pop album in history. The follow-up, \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" was released in May 2000 and sold something mammoth like 4 million worldwide in seven days. All the four singles from that album are on this Greatest Hits - the pop perfection that is \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" the cheesy but addictive \\"Lucky,\\" the powerful and punchy \\"Stronger\\" and the Shania-penned ballad \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know.\\"<br /><br />Britney mania had swept the world for the past three years and in 2001 Britney released her self-titled third album. The album spawned five huge worldwide hits, but they were significantly less popular than her earlier material. However, she had undergone a noticeable growth, musically, which resulted in more R'n'B influenced material. The funky \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" was an unexpected treat that divided fans but has ultimately stood up well since it's release, whilst \\"Overprotected\\" is pure pop fun. \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" was a big No.2 worldwide hit despite being one of Britney's more average ballads. \\"Boys (CO-ED Remix)\\" was a return to the R'n'B of Slave, but was less successful, whilst Britney's terrible cover of \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" didn't do as well.<br /><br />She returned in 2003 with \\"In The Zone\\" which spawned four big hits, all of which feature on here. The Madonna-duet \\"Me Against The Music\\" and \\"Outrageous\\" are both rather average songs, but the classic pop perfection of the zany \\"Toxic\\" and the beauty of the emotional ballad \\"Everytime\\" stand up as two of her best songs to date - and two massive UK No.1 singles. This Greatest Hits also features three 'new' songs. The first is Britney's cover of \\"My Prerogative,\\" which I do like but don't regard as one of her best songs. \\"Do Somethin'\\" is similar to Toxic whilst \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" was an ITZ outtake, sounding very similar to No Doubt's Hella Good.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />When you can sell 65 million albums in six years, you must be doing something right. That's quite an achievement that no one of the past ten years has achieved and when you consider her passion for her job, you know Britney isn't going away any time soon. The girl will be in this for life. I mean by the time she's 30 she'll have sold 100 million records and be set in stone as the dominant figure of popular culture even more than she already is. What can I say, she's a legend in the making.

B000002UB6|5.0|For any other band in the world this is a greatest hits album. ( 3 #1 hits )For the Beatles its a bland over produced piece of mediocrity that Phil Spector got his hands on . The \\"hits\\" on the album, Let It Be , Get Back and The Long and Winding Road are all ok - but not quite up to Beatle standards . Thats the bad news - now the good news : There's some great stuff on here. Two of Us , I've Got A Feeling ,One After 909 and Across The Universe, are all great. I Dig a Pony is a killer John Lennon tune. Even the little ditty Dig It is great. If this were a Stones , Nirvana, Velvet Underground or Clash album , the critics would be creamimg over it... but its a Beatles album so its held to a higher standard and therefore doesnt get its place on anyones \\" list \\" .
B00001NFCY|5.0|After \\"My Own Prison,\\" Creed was hard-pressed to come up with something just as good. They didn't. In my mind, they surpassed their debut release with what I consider to be the best rock album of our generation. Hauntingly passionate, powerfully driven, this album delivers everything one could want in a rock CD. Definitely a solid release.    Creed's debut \\"My Own Prison\\" was one of the best rock albums released; however, it was not the album for which Creed is credited with having made a huge mark on rock history. This is definitely the one. Creed kicks off the album by asking the listener, \\"Are you ready for what's to come?\\" We thought we were. We definitely weren't.    No song has ever moved me like \\"Higher\\" did. But it's hard to pick a favorite from this album. All the songs fit perfectly together and flow from one to the other with unparalled ease. The album has a great blend of Creed's driving heavy rock and their lighter, inspirational tone. No album has captured my heart as this one has.
B0002IU988|5.0|While I do miss Creed (partially because I'm a singer, and I believe that Scott Stapp has a superb voice), I must admit that \\"One Day Remains has almost all of Creed's best elements and then some. Although it lacks some of the introspective lyrics and passion that dominated Creed's albums, it maintains a very positive outlook on life. When I first heard \\"Open Your Eyes\\" on Madden, I instantly fell in love with the music. And when I discovered that it was Mark Tremonti's new band, I was hooked.    Don't get me wrong; I am in no way calling Alter Bridge the next Creed. However, since three of the four members of Alter Bridge were former members of Creed, I think it's fair to make judgments and comparisons based on Creed. If you're looking for a band that carries that driving rock style that was iconic for Creed, this is it. Bear in mind, however, that there are several differences (uh...it's a new band...). Most notably, Myles Kennedy. In my opinion, he doesn't have the voice quality nor the passion that Scott Stapp has. Stapp is a much more powerful singer, but that's not to say that he fits better with these guys than Kennedy does. Frankly, I think it's an excellent change.    Secondly, this is not the singer's band. Stapp was the frontman for Creed in more ways than one. Kennedy is nothing more than the lead vocalist. The true heart of Alter Bridge is Mark Tremonti. And it shows. Songs like \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"Down to My Last\\" really showcase Tremonti's talent as a guitarist. In recent years, Tremonti was being called \\"the best guitarist of the early 21st century.\\" It was debatable while he was with Creed. Now that debate has been laid to rest. Mark Tremonti is more than an amazing guitarist.    Again, this has got to be one of the best rock albums I've heard. I highly recommend this. And if you've got the change, pick up the new 12 Stones album \\"Potter's Field\\" and Submersed \\"In Due Time.\\" Two more great albums in the wake of Creed's breakup.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Can't Take Me Home is probably a collection of Pink's greatest output of talent ever. This was the very first CD that she made when she first got into Hollywood, and in my opinion, it was the best CD that she ever made. This CD was from when she was fairly new to the market and thus wasn't bold enough to try out different genre of music. The collection of the songs in this CD were fairly mainstream and catchy. I gradually fell in love with this CD as I listened to it over and over again. All of the songs complement each other ver well and give the CD a very well-rounded outlook as a whole.  <br /> <br />However, Pink's next two CDs were surprisingly disappointing. She seemed to get bolder each time at trying new type of music such as rock. Now she became this punk rock crazy chick. All of a sudden she wasn't the Pink that I used to like anymore. So, obviously, her songs aren't that great to me anymore.  <br /> <br />How artist positions his/her own image in Hollywood is important to the audience. Pink's change of image, well, and attitude, kind of pushed me away from her music. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I still strongly recommend this CD. It's great.  <br />
0452282152|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about this book, I mean, who wants to read about 17th century Holland??  I'm glad I picked it up because it was a great book!  One thing that I love in a book is the author's ability to paint a picture, so to speak, in my head.  This was definitely the case here.  You can even picture the exotic mixture of colors that the painter uses.  It's a wonderful book!
067940581X|3.0|This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world. This book is a bit boring and dry in the sense that everything is just always so beautifully fitting. Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one.
B000000XBC|5.0|Vol. 1 may have had all those songs you can sing along to even if you don't know who CCR is. Vol 2 is not as accessable, but I would probably say it is better than Vol. 1 because you haven't heard all these songs over and over again. Listening to this, you realize how amazing CCR is. Nearly any one of these songs could have been a hit song, and the reason people dismiss them is because they never heard these songs before. You need this comp if you like CCR at all!
B000003AEB|5.0|First up, to the dumb b-tch who wants to be flappin her mouth about how shi-ty this album is, stick to your own sht. I dont go up in the arty guitarists forums and trash talk even though it sounds like trembly pu$$y-a$$ whiteboys cryin about their problems to me. Stick to your own. You aint gotta like the music i listen to. nobodys tryina force it on you so why you talkin like its a thorn in yo'side? You got no reason to take up a problem with music u dont even listen to so why u wastin your time to write a review that dont help anyone whose actually triyina decide to buy the album or not by reading opinions about the production and merit and the qualities of the songs. your review dont even actually tell why u hate it u basically just sht-talkin about it cause you dont like rap.  <br /> <br />the facts that it exists shouldnt bother u that much. chill out girl. I dont like your music either but i can repect that choice that u made to listen to it cause thats YOUR taste and we all do our own thang so nobody here is sayin u must listen to Snoop. and u got nothin better to do than hate on something u know nothing about. youre wack <br /> <br />Aight now onto the review, peoples basically already said it. No value far as \\"real issues\\" are concerned, (\\"da chronic\\" got a leg up on this joint in that area) but its aight cuz doggystyle is just a day in the life of the endo smokin tanqueray sippin Dogg. hes washed up nowadays but this piece here is a slice of snoop at his prime, chill, smooth, and fly. The way im ratin it is simple: content aint a question cause it aint about the words. the only question is does it put \\"a glide in yo stride and a dip in yo hip?\\" yeah it do. if you cant git a groove on when this is playin you either aint got rhythm or you too dam white. just playin. <br /> <br />Anyway the beats is bangin the samples dope the rhymes get u laughin and its easy to get with the flow. Yall know snoop dont give a sht about it all as long as the album gets you movin to the beat and makes him the loot. Rating: slim wit da tilted brim (recomended)

078322799X|5.0|This is one entertaining horror flick, the performance of Michael J. Fox is great as usual. The plot is far from bored and shallow. We can be terrified and entertained from the beginning til the end of the film.<br /><br />I've seen the movie more than couples time but I just bought the DVD from Amazon. Too bad the cover I've received is different from the one shown on the web :(

B0006399FS|5.0|No band on the planet looks as unflinchingly into those old questions we ask when we're callow and we ask when we're about to check out permanently -- why are we here? what is God? what's next? -- as U2 has been doing for the better part of a quarter century.  They appreciate complexity and mystery as much as beauty and their music consistently celebrates all three.  Celebrates all three with wonderful rock and roll and, despite the occasional clunker of a line (try \\"always pain before the child is born\\" on Yahweh) without dumbing down to its audience.  How To is no exception.  Of the eleven cuts, only A Man and A Woman falls slightly below excellence.  Everything else, for me at least, is flat out superb, most similar in sound and quality to Joshua Tree.  Favorite four cuts:  Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own, City of Blinding Lights, One Step Closer, and Original of the Species.  To listen to U2 is to feel at once challenged and renewed -- always has been that way and I'm betting it always will.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I bought this cd because I liked a lot the Time is running out video. But when I started to hear it I realized that Muse has a great variety of songs on this cd. It has great slow and melodic songs and it also has great powerful songs like The end of the world or Buterflies and hurricanes. This CD can be described as crazy but beatiful. Muse's best CD
B00014NE62|5.0|I remember seeing parts of Maurice on TV when I was a kid and the whole gay thing was so forbidden--I had to turn the channel when I heard my parents coming.  I have always wondered what it was about, so when I saw it on DVD, I ordered it.  What a surprising treasure.  Although sensual at times, it is in no way a skin-flick.  It is such a great story told in a colorfully rich, genuine way.  Classically acted, it is full of integrity, honest struggles without being clich&eacute; or angst ridden, and true to relationships of lovers, friends, and family.  It moves at a slow pace, but a very enjoyable one.  It is like watching a novel.  Art. Beauty.  Joy.  It is a film that represents what gay cinema and story telling could and should be; actually, what any cinema could and should be.  I believe this film can have universal appeal beyond gay or straight.  I am proud to have this film in my DVD library.  The extra features are very good as well, definitely watch them last, as they will alter the way you view the film.  Get it, enjoy it!
B0001WTWCO|1.0|What a snore fest this movie was!  I watched this with my sister-in-law and she was transfixed.  This movie went on and on with these dream sequences (or memories?) that made no sense.  After an hour and half of these unrelated boring sequences (with WWII in the background) I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave.  Even the music couldn't make up for it.  I personally hated this movie but my sister-in-law loved it.  She watches soap operas and Oprah, so maybe she posesses a sensitivity and understanding of  something in the movie I didn't get.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never heard of this series until it came out on DVD and was recommended by Netflix... I rented the first dvd and after watching it I cancelled the rest and promptly bought the series. It is second only to Space Above and Beyond for quality writing and characterization. I LOVED this show... I wish TV executives would encourage this type of Sci-Fi instead of the brainless crap they usually push on us. Expand you mind, buy this DVD Set for your self, then buy it for all of your friends
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|The second season of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" is when a lot of things did not happen to Lorelai Gilmore.  It started with Lorelai not marrying Max (\\"Red Light on the Wedding Night\\") and ended with her not marrying Christopher (\\"I Can't Get Started\\"), but Sookie got married so at least there was some progress in that area, although the duo's plan to open an inn together hits a major roadblock (\\"The Ins and Outs of Inns\\").  Of course, the most important thing that did not happen to Lorelai was that she manages to really notice Luke despite the fact he is pretty much there in front of her every morning at the diner.  Clearly the creators of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" remember what happened to \\"Moonlighting\\" once Dave and Maddie stopped bantering and started kissing and other things, so the agenda is to put off the inevitable for as long as possible.  So even if it is obvious to everyone else in Stars Hollow (to wit, Emily), does not mean that Lorelai has a clue.<br /><br />As for Rory, her junior year at Chilton has its ups and downs. and not just because of Paris.  The ups would be \\"The Road Trip to Harvard\\" and making her society debut (\\"Presenting Lorelai Gilmore\\"), while the downside would be the rift between her and her grandfather because of Dean (\\"Sadie, Sadie\\") and the problems with Dean because of Jess (\\"There's the Rub\\" and \\"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\\").  If anything, the common denominator is to make sure that none of the Gilmore women are happy, which means Rory is mad at Lorelai for blaming Jess for the accident (\\"Help Wanted,\\" Lorelai is mad at Emily for arranging their going to a spa together (\\"There's the Rub\\") and Emily is mad at Richard for quitting his job without consulting here (\\"The Bracebridge Dinner\\").  What?  You thought Emily was going to be mad at Rory?  Are you kidding?  Have you not been watching this show?<br /><br />For me the fascinating part is watching the yang of Lorelai and Emily's relationship compared to the yin of the Lorelai and Rory dynamic.  For me some of the most memorable moments from season two are when Emily orders Richard to make up with Rory because if their granddaughter ever gets married she to know about it (Lorelai did not tell her parents about her engagement to Max) and the look on her parent's face with Lorelai gets her business school diploma (\\"Lorelai's Graduation Day\\").  But then a good rule of thumb is anytime we see a chink in Emily's armor it is a moment that will be hard to forget.  I am still trying to make up my mind as to whether or not Lorelai has an even more strained relationship with her father than her mother, given his visit to her place of work (\\"Richard in Stars Hollow\\") and her visit to his new office (\\"Help Wanted\\").  I am certainly leaning in that direction, but it is still open to debate.<br /><br />But overall the two emotional highpoints of the second season finding Lorelai giving and then receiving as good as she gets.  The giving happens in \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" when a totally distraught Lorelai goes after Luke because of the car accident where Rory gets hurt (slightly hurt, but hurt is hurt, and there is a cast on her arm, mister), creating a serious rift in their relationship.  The receiving is two episodes later in \\"Lorelai's Graduation Day\\" when Rory misses the big event and offers the most high speed combined heartfelt apology and verbal self-flagellation in television history (I agree with her, I think she had a stroke or something).<br /><br />My strong affection for high-speed dialogue can be traced from \\"Gilmore Girls\\" back to \\"Moonlight\\" and beyond to \\"The Thing From Another World\\" and any movie starring Groucho Marx.  Equally as strong is my enjoyment of gratuitous pop culture references, especially as manifested in \\"The Simpsons\\" and \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\"  So to have a series that combines both of these elements and provides deleted scenes on the DVD is one of those absolute joys you hear so much about (although my wife is tired of me explaining all of the references, allusions, and impromptu name dropping).  Then again, while I knew from the start that Carole King was singing the show's theme song \\"Where You Lead\\" with her daughter Louis Goffin, I only recently figure out they had re-recorded the song with some of the lines changed to better fit the show (No, I do not fast forward through the title sequence; I always listen to the song).<br /><br />I am also pleased to see that the \\"Gilmore Girls\\" is being seen around the world, although I have to wonder how the pop culture references translate into out cultures (I have no doubt people can speak real fast in any language).  But you can see \\"Gilmore Girls\\" now from Argentina (the current season is on the Warner Channel Thursdays at 21:00 with past seasons shown weekdays at 11:30 and 16:30) to the United Kingdom (Sundays at 18:00 on Nickeloden U.K.).  It is nice to think that Stars Hollow's madonna and child have gone international.of the references, allusions, and impromptu name dropping).

B0000DJZA5|4.0|There ought to be two internets: One for normal people and one for fanatics. Internet A would be the internet we know today minus all the stuff for ultra zealous fanatics-Trekkies, people who collect Beanie Babies, Dead Heads...and Beatlemaniacs. Internet B would strictly be for their wares.  <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with hobbies and enthusiasm. What is wrong is Capitol/Apple Corp dumping more Fab Four product on an unsuspecting public. I thought we'd seen the definitive and ultimate Mop Top stuff when the \\"Anthology\\" anthologies came about. Expansive, interesting peek into the evolution of the Beatles as writers and recording artists. Great. Then came \\"Beatles 1\\". Alright. Nice, tight way to remind everyone who the Beatles were (did we need to?) and what they did(and to push the latest Elvis repackaging off the top of the charts). Now comes \\"Let it Be...Naked.\\" I'm sorry, but what the devil is the point if not simply to sell more records. Don't think they've sold enough units? Ask Paul McCartney for a glance at his bank statement. The only folks who would be truly interested in this \\"alternate and original vision\\" by the group would be Beatlemaniacs...and they've probably already got several bootleg versions. <br /> <br />Peoria doesn't need such statements and I frankly doubt if they care. Does it really bother Gladys in Boring, Oregon that there are strings and women's voices on \\"The Long and Winding Road?\\" I mean, she's been singing along with it in her car for 34 years already. Does Stan in Orchard Park, NY care that George Harrison has added a second harmony to the chorus of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" that isn't on the single? And how many versions of the title track are there? I lost count at around 23.  <br /> <br />One of the wonderful things about the Beatles is that their music is so timeless, so universal, and so influential that it doesn't need any help. There's a reason that every decade a new generation of kids discovers the Beatles. Perhaps it was from hearing a parent sing \\"Golden Slumbers\\" to them, perhaps it was hearing someone cover \\"Revolution\\" in a club, perhaps it was seeing a cool poster or photo of the band. Whatever it took, that's all it takes for a person to begin their own journey of curiosity, research, exploration, and wonder. That's organic, natural, and fun. If anything the appearance of \\"new\\" Beatle product waters down the brilliance of the pieces that Mssr.Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr intended to release. The only thing saving discs like \\"Let it Be...Naked\\" from being utter crap is the guys who made the record. They were the Beatles, after all.
B00005221M|2.0|I don't mind expansion nearly as much as I mind all the deletions from this version.  I love this film, but the DVD expanded edition is awful.  What is with these directors?  It's like George Lucas saying Star Wars films are his and he can do what he likes with them.  I'm sorry, but these films become part of our lives.  Mess with them if you must, but at least give us the choice.  I've been replacing my vhs with DVD, but back to the vhs version for me.
B00000K3CM|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie, but almost every event in it has a parallel from the first movie.  Kevin, still disgruntled over being made the family scapegoat, hates his family's guts and wishes them away.  Through a mishap at the airport, his wish comes true again!  Unfortunately, his old friends, the Wet Bandits, are back and are out for revenge, big time.  Still, even though this movie is a rehash, it improves over the first.  Kevin uses a gangster movie to scare away uninvited guests, like in the first.  Kevin encounters an eccentric outcast who scares him at first, but ends up teaching him an important life lesson and comes to his rescue when the bad guys finally catch him.  Again, like the first HA.  And of course, what Home Alone movie would be complete without a house full of booby traps to tear the bandits to pieces? <br />My one complaint is that HA2 is much darker and grittier than HA1.  This time, the bad guys don't merely want to hurt Kevin, they actually intend to kill him.  The scene where Harry pulls a gun on Kevin went beyond bad taste for me.  Also, the traps Kevin sets this time are much more dangerous (and funny), and would easily kill someone in real life. <br />Still, it's worth your time watching this holiday season.
B000001DTM|5.0|It seems that all of the great bands have a magnum opus to point to that solidified their music careers. The Beatles have Abbey Road, The Who has Who's Next, The Rolling Stones have Beggars Banquet, Radiohead has OK Computer ... alright, I think you get my drift. There are two U2 albums in my mind that stand out, 1987's The Joshua Tree and 1991's Achtung Baby. While The Joshua Tree is a very good piece of music, there is no comparison for what U2 has done before or since Achtung was released. I know it's been beaten like a drum, but U2 really did redefine themselves with AB. U2 will not get any better than this. Ever. The single U2 musician that shines above all others is The Edge. The guy is simply in a zone from the opening rift of Zoo Station to the very end of Love is Blindness. The guitar parts on Until the End of the World, The Fly and Acrobat are immensely impressive. He plays like some kind of guitar god. The lyrics by Bono are very good and his singing is even better (than the real thing ... sorry, couldn't resist!). The backbeat by Larry and Adam keep AB on a steady course. The production by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno and Steve Lillywhite is first rate. Yes, I admit that I'm a big U2 fan, but for those of you who are not, this is is an excellent piece of music! Buy it.
0064400557|5.0|Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is an awesome book to read no matter what age you are.  This Newberry Honor Book tells us about two extraordinary friendships.  These friendships are Wilbur and Fern's and Wilbur and Charlotte's.  The first friendship White writes for us is of Fern and Wilbur's love for each other.  Fern saved Wilbur from being killed because he was a runt and because of that, the two became best friends and inseparable.  As life goes on and Fern grows older, Wilbur finds him a new best friend in the barn of which he lives.  Her name is Charlotte and she, like Fern, also saved Wilbur's life. <br /> This was one of my favorite books in elementary school and it is still one of my favorites to this day.  Children are able to read this book and feel connections through this book with the relationships of the characters.  Not only the best friends of Fern, Wilbur, and Charlotte, but also the other relationships such as Templeton helping Charlotte save Wilbur's life.  Without Templeton, Charlotte wouldn't have had the lettering to weave into her web.  This teaches children that you may not always want to do something, but if it's for the better of someone else, you probably should.  Templeton was greedy with his food and life but he put aside (grumpily) his greed for a few moments to find these words for Charlotte and Wilbur. <br /> When I become a teacher, I thought about reading this book to my classes so they can listen to such a wonderful book.  I started thinking about some lessons to tie in with reading the book aloud and I thought of a social studies lesson with the types of occupations when the book takes place.  Farming was a big occupation in these days and I want my students to know that all the jobs available now were not available during the setting of the book.  I also thought of reviewing different farm animals and letting students pick a farm animal to do a mini project on.  I think students would have so much fun researching this stuffon the computer, and while they do not know it, they will be learning how to use the internet to search their topics.  When we are finished reading the book, I will have my students write a story about their favorite farm animal in the book or write a story about how they would save their best friends life.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I know I'm probably older (35) than most of you fellow music lovers, but I haven't been so impressed with a cd in a long time. <br />I caught \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" on Billboard Music Awards last night and ran to the first store that was open so I could have \\"American Idiot\\" in my cd player for the morning commute.  It was great chuckling at the oh-so-cynical lyrics on the bus and the funny looks from my fellow bus passengers only added to the delight.  It was really hard to refrain from singing along to \\"Holiday\\", but I managed. <br />I think the reason I love Green Day so much is they are obviously influenced by the greats like the Beatles but still have a fresh sound. I plan to force my hip-hop loving teen to listen to this as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Buy this cd now if you love music at all! <br /> <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|Before I bought this cd the only other cd I owned from radiohead was Pablo Honey,which in my opinion was a good record.After listening to OK computer,I gradually found myself obsessing about certain nuances which make it unique from any other records made in the mid to late 1990's.OK computer is a throwback to the concept records of the 1970's (Dark side of the moon or other Floydian 70's albums).Its album cover being pale white with the only a blurred outline of a human figure suggesting the whiting out of human expession to the benign sterile existence of the present technological age.The music is itself a dark rambling through the consciousness of the modern age which is at once angry as well as very depressing.The beauty of certain melodies in some of the songs (No surprises,Let down, are strong examples)shows the powerfulness of radioheads' creativity as musicians. I found that this was the type of album that you could listen to all the way through ( one of the nice things about albums that are conceptual)and there really isn't a poor song on the album.Since my puchase of OK computer, I have bought all of radiohead's records but this is by far their best effort .I found Kid A and Amneseiac to be too unsound musically.Another album of interest that I liked was The Bends.Hail to The Thief wasn't bad either but misses again because too much of this record is like the two previous records before it.I doubt radiohead will return with another record like this for fear of becoming too commercialized! The real irony is other than the song Karma Poilce,you almost never hear anything from this album on the radio or Mtv.To me this album will stand the test of time and will be recognized as a masterpiece,one of the few that truly deserves this title.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|Shania Twain's first album is the one to get.  She was (pretty much) a country artist at the time.  I imagine the lure of pop-country paychecks proved too much to resist.  I hope that the next trend is a retro-country sound influenced by the likes of Alan Jackson and George Strait.  I'd really like to see Shania take a chance here and there in her career.  \\"You might say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one....\\"  You should buy this CD if you want a collection of the tunes that maked me turn the country dial whenever they come on the air.  Gimme some Merle Travis any day of the week over this collection of essentially teen centered pop.  Where's the heartache?  Where's the pain?
B0002OERI0|4.0|this is something i have been waiting for since 1994.  Sure, Green Day has been consistent with ctachy music, but not since Dookie have i been completely knocked off my chair by a pwoerful sound that i heard in 'american ideot'.  The album starts off wit a bang with the title track 'American Ideot', and takes us through a journey of music, politics and powerful lyrics from then on.  The song really does set the tone for the rest of the album.  As much as i do enjoy 'Boulevard of broken dreams', my next pic has got to be 'Jesus of Suburbia'.  It reminds me of when iw as younger having to stand through about 5 different hymns with no break, just a 2 second progression into the next one.  This song, with 5 differnt songs within it, is a montage of catchy beats and good melody-music.  Finally, St. Jimmy.  This brings back the old sound of Green Day.  A fast paced, pure-punk sounding song.  Enough said.  I would recommend this too any music fan, not just another punk-listnener, but any one person who enjoys music that means something, grab this album as fast as you can!
B00006AG5N|5.0|How time flies by!  My current 2 CD compilation of Elvis Presley's biggest hits was issued way back in 1988.  And to put it mildly the sound quality on that collection leaves much to be desired.  Recently, I borrowed RCA's 2002 release \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" from my local library and gave it a listen.  The difference in the sound quality was astounding!  It goes without saying that the technology has come a long way in the past 16 years.<br /><br />In my view, \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" has got to be the finest collection ever assembled of the much beloved \\"King of Rock & Roll\\".  All 30 tunes included on this single disc collection were #1 songs either here in the USA or in England where Elvis' remains incredibly popular even to this day. And there is such a wide variety of styles included here covering every phase of Elvis Presley's remarkable career at RCA records. You are sure to enjoy old favorites like \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"One Night\\" and \\"It's Now Or Never\\" all digitally remastered and crystal clear. Amazing!  Younger fans might recall hits from the early 1970's like \\"Suspicious Minds\\" and the hard driving \\"Burning Love\\" from the Fall of 1972.  I was also pleased to find a couple of tunes I do not currently own including \\"Wooden Heart\\" and \\"Way Down\\" both of which made it to the top of the charts in England.  And as an added bonus, RCA has included the 2002 worldwide smash \\"A Little Less Conversation\\".  This remix of the original recording helped introduce Elvis to a whole new generation of fans.  Listen to it a few times and you will find that this tune will grow on you too.<br /><br />If you are at all like me you like to see some decent liner notes when you purchasing a collection like this. RCA has included a nicely done 24 page booklet with this set. And best of all the price is extremely attractive.  While I am not ordinarily in the habit of replacing CD's in my collection I am going to make an exception in this case.  As soon as I stop typing, I am going to order \\"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits\\" and toss out my old collection from 1988.  It is that much of an upgrade.  Very highly recommended!!!#1 Hits\\" and toss out my old collection from 1988.  It is that much of an upgrade.  Very highly recommended!!!

Dawn of the Dead was the long awaited sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead and is one of the few examples where a sequel is as good as or even better than the predecessor.  It is a strange mixture of horror and satire. <br /> <br />Romero's story is a clever one.  Four people hide in a suburbian shopping mall from a canabalistic Zombie Apocolypse.  At first they believe they are living in a shelter of paradise, but as time goes by thier lives become more and more empty.  The film climax's with a battle between the film's heroes, a renegade motorcycle gang, and of course the zombies!!!  The film contains gore at a level never seen before on the big screen.  The audience becomes almost immune to it by the end of the film.  Infact, the violence becomes one of the film's many charms.  Romero is able to combine humor with horror and makes a point about society's obbession over commercial items.  Though the film may not be appreciated with its first viewing, it is truly a horror masterpiece.  Dawn is a film that has grown in popularity over the decades, and will continue to do so.
B000002NC4|2.0|I recently purchased this cd because of reviews on amazon and I'am really glad that I got it for 5 dollars because I would be very upset if I would have spent anymore it is worth one listen for something different but I won't be reaching for it anytime soon nothing at all like modest mouse like the one reveiew said the one reveiew got it really good just boring and just drags it isn't so bad that you take it out just not worth a second listen.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I bought her first CD and love it. Now I bought this one too but got disappointed. What I love is amazing rock. As for lyrics, I prefer DIDO. No doubt some songs are good in this CD but it is not even close to the level of the first CD.
B000005GYI|5.0|As a young jazz musician I grew up hearing Milton on Wayne Shorter's fine album.  I loved Milton's tunes and his voice, listening to them over and over, and they became etched in my memory.      But little did I know about these early albums!!!  I happened to find out about them because I've been revisiting Brazilian music lately, having made some Brazilian friends.  I was delighted to hear songs that I already knew, but in their earlier forms, such as Cravo E Canela, O Trem Azul, Nada Sera Como Antes, etc.  I'm afraid I'm going to pile on like everybody else and extol the the gold mine of delights of this album.  I can't help it, as I feel like I've discovered buried treasure.  The \\"Beatlesque\\" things are cool, too.  Back when I was buying Milton vinyl there just wasn't that good a selection in the U.S., and then I just moved onto other things, blissfully ignorant of all these other albums.      I've already added Cravo to my guitar set, and will probably do 2 or 3 more.  I'm even going to try to learn Portuguese so I can sing a couple of these.  I want to thank everybody for writing these helpful reviews!    While praising Milton, I should also mention that Lo Borges also has a very prominent role on this album, and contributes some really good songs.      Muito obrigado, Milton!!!!
0694003611|5.0|Goodnight Moon is as fresh and poignant as the day it was first published more than 50 years ago.  The author taps into a child's world and gives us a perfectly crafted accompaniment to bedtime in words and pictures.  This little story told through a child's eyes is in tune with the experience of any child safely in their bedroom at night time.    I came late to Goodnight Moon, having been brought up in England where it isn't well known.  But now I have a daughter and our bedtime routine is all the better for Goodnight Moon.  I'm now reading it to her from memory every night.  The rhythm of the words and phrases is like a piece of music: it's a complete and satisfying bedtime lullaby in words.  And you can pick up something different every time you read it.    The sense of warmth and security coming through the pictures and sounds in Goodnight Moon is unmistakeable.  A word to those adults whose own childhood experiences of bedtime were not so sweet -- watch out: reading this book to your child can be a healing experience for you!

B00007LTIA|5.0|I was going to write a brilliant review of this great album until I read Jeff Salters review and I thought that sums it up perfectly.   <br /> <br />I will say though that as a music lover especially of Rock music I find myself disheartened by today's musical landscape.  It doesn't have to be this way, what went wrong?  Even the bands that are supposed to be amoung the best of today, Rem, U2 just are not on the same level as the great bands of the 70's.  As I listen back to the classic Yes records, The Yes Album through Going For THe One I am astounded that a band like this ever even existed. <br /> <br />One suggestion I have for listening to this album.  DO it alone turn down the lights and block everything else out of your life.  In other words enter into this world completely surrender to it and then and only then can it work its magic.  If you give it the right effort you will be rewarded!! YES FOREVER!!
068987474X|3.0|When I first heard about this book, I was sure it would be chock full of answers to the mysteries of men.  In truth, this book is funny, but only a good place to start understanding how to handle yourself in relationships.  I think that like any advice you get, about half of it is applicable.  Not every situation is quite so cut and dried, but there is some good advice in the book.  If you're a single female, it's worth reading, but be smart about what you take away from the book.
B00005JMCW|5.0|this movie is about a mom and her daughter who dont understand each other. they soon figure it out though, they switch bodies and have to live each others lives.  this is a great movie for the whole family.  i love the movie, the point of the movie, and the music in the movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Out of no where, out of oblivion, Green Day have become my new obsession and \\"American Idiot\\" my definite favourite album of 2004. It's as simple as that. I knew who the band were but couldn't name one of their albums a couple of months ago. Then I heard the new album's first single, and I was bowled over. I bought the album two weeks after it came out and was at No.1 in the US and UK, and what I discovered was a total revelation. I'm a fan of rock music from bands such as Oasis, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana, but Green Day are seriously up there amongst the best with this new album.  <br /> <br />It is obvious that a lot of time and effort has been put into this album - it's flawless. I was particularly intrigued by the two 9-minute songs on the album, because it portrayed a confident approach to the music - that a band of this status could pull something off without falling flat on their faces. People have criticised this album for attacking George Bush and his decisions in a post-September 11th world where terrorism is a daily crisis. However, references towards this are made subtly and work extremely well - they have the facts and public opinion to back up their statements, and they are saying that they do love America as a nation, but not what it has become over the past three years.  <br /> <br />American Idiot opens with the lead single, \\"American Idiot.\\" This is a heavy and upbeat rock song that will no doubt become an anthem over the next year or so. It really does deserve it, because it's a fantastic song to capture people's attention. The video is great too - Billie Joe looks so hot...the only man I've ever found sexy in mascara! Up next is \\"Jesus Of Suburbia,\\" the first of the two 9-minute masterpieces. This is the best of the two and is made up of five smaller songs, the first being \\"Jesus Of Suburbia,\\" followed by \\"City Of The Damned\\" which is a brilliant mid-tempo rocker, followed by the upbeat \\"I Don't Care\\" which is even heavier. Thesong then slows down for the awesome \\"Dearly Beloved,\\" which is SO catchy! This in then followed by \\"Tales Of Another Broken Home,\\" which is the final 'song' on this epic, and it's just as good as what has gone before it. \\"Holiday\\" is the third track and has a brilliant beat, disturbingly 'happy' lyrics sung in an obvious ironic tone and a wicked rap that totally rips Bush apart. \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is probably the best song on the whole album, because it has a real anthemic feel to it of open spaces and a grand perspective not matched by anything else on the album.  <br /> <br />\\"Are We The Waiting\\" was one of my favourites to begin with, but I don't like it as much now - it has a real opera-rock feel to it, and reminds me of a Queen song. \\"St. Jimmy\\" is an up-tempo number with some great riffs, whilst \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" is a brilliant mid-tempo song with a very harmonised chorus. The song has an almost Caribbean flair to it, which is a nice change. This is followed by the brilliant \\"She's A Rebel,\\" another one of my favourites on the album. The song's lyrics are also interesting because they relate to the album cover, \\"She's the symbol of resistance, and she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade.\\" The song is hardly two minutes long before the next song plays it. It's called \\"Extraordinary Girl,\\" and is one of my favourites on the whole album. Not many people like this song from reviews that I have read, but I like it because it dares to be experimental and the results are rather pleasing. The Oriental-theme works very well, and the chorus is very memorable, especially the lyrics, \\"She gets so sick of crying.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Letterbomb\\" is not one of my favourites, but this is such an amazing album that overall it's still good. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is another one of my favourites on the album here, and I think it's highly unlikely that this song was made TRACK 11 by coincidence! The song itself is a very mid-tempo and heartfelt song witha slow guitar that works brilliantly. The drums build the song up very well, and I guess you could say this is Billie Joe's softer side shining through. The second and final of the album's two 9-minute epics comes in the form of \\"Homecoming.\\" This too has five smaller songs all blended into one, the first being \\"The Death Of St. Jimmy\\" which is a hook-laden song that is followed by \\"East 12th St.\\" This song asks many questions and has a brilliant middle section. \\"Nobody Likes You\\" is sung in a distrubingly lullaby style with soldier-like drums and church bells, whilst \\"Rock And Roll Girlfriend\\" continues the pace but isn't really one of my favourites - the trumpet sounds really out of place. \\"We're Coming Home Again\\" closes the song overall and I couldn't think of anything better - it really is wicked! \\"Whatsername\\" closes the album overall, after almost an hour. The song itself is fairly upbeat and works well to close this masterpiece epic.  <br /> <br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10  <br /> <br />I would definitely say that this is my favourite album of 2004, because it's fresh and new and exciting for me, and most importantly, it has a theme. It has a real message that Green Day weren't afraid to express, because they knew the music was good enough to shine through and that people would see the album's genius. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone interested in Green Day, because this is sure to be a big starting point for many newcomers. The guys have surpassed all expectations here - buy it.
6305949980|3.0|Tim Burton's name is above the title, and it was \\"his\\" film, even though he didn't direct it. He had his old pal, Henry Selick, whom he had gone to school with at Cal Arts, and worked with at Disney, direct it. Burton came up with the idea, while at Disney. He wrote at epic poem, and made some sketchs. Disney shot the idea down, but they filed it away as their property. Many years later, after Tim Burton had achieved success as a director, when he reapproached them with the concept, they were only too happy to finance it; to the tune of $20 million bucks.<br /><br />Selick and Burton had collaborated in 1982, on Burton's stop-action short, VINCENT. Stop action animation, owing a lot to pioneers Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen, is very time consuming. This film took three years to complete. With a crew of over 400, Selick could only produce one minute of finished film for every weeks work. The film was 76 minutes when it was released. They were influenced by the films done in the 1920's, called German Expressionism; like NOSFERATU, and THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.<br /><br />NIGHTMARE is really more a musical, than most Disney animated films that contained musical interludes. Danny Elfman, used by Burton for BATMAN and SCISSORHANDS, did the music. Most of his tunes were quite pedestrian; almost Gilbert and Sullivan operetta stuff. It needed the hand of say an Alan Menkin, or Elton John. Elfman sang all the songs for the main character, Jack Skellington. Chris Sarandon voiced the small amount of dialogue not sung.<br /><br />What has emerged is a wonderfully wicked and twisted fairy tale. It was like letting Playboy's cartoonist, Gahan Wilson, reconfigure the Brothers Grimm. And it owed a lot to Dr. Seuss. There was the tone of the Grinch here and there. Fairy tales in their original form, were somewhat dark, bloody and heavy-handed. Over the centuries we have let Walt Disney and Madison Avenue douse them with saccharine, and blunt many their lovely barbs and thorns.<br /><br />Catherine O'Hara did the voice work for Sally, Jack's patchwork girlfriend. William Hickey voiced the wicked Dr. Finkelstein, and he was inspired in his interpretation. Paul Reubens did the voice for one of Jack's henchmen; the one called Lock. Ken Page voiced Mr. Oogie Boogie, who was fairly scary, and Ed Ivory did St. Nick.<br /><br />I liked this film better during the second viewing, but its dark vision still left the bitter taste of rusty metal in my mouth. I prefer my Christmas films a bit sweeter, I guess. Some might argue the this film is more a Halloween film than a Christmas film. Whatever it is labeled, it remains creative, unique, twisted, and delightful.and thorns. <br /> <br />Catherine O'Hara did the voice work for Sally, Jack's patchwork girlfriend.

B00065GX64|5.0|\\"M\\" is one of the greatest German films ever made. Hitchcock had deep admiration for it and it is easy to see how this film influenced him as much as it did. The film operates on several different levels: a suspense film about a serial killer of children; a psychological study of a deviant; a stunning directorial work of style; a probing look at free will vs. compulsion. There are many scenes here that are brilliantly framed and filmed. Lang arranges the scenery and the actors for full compositional effect. Peter Lorre gives a great performance as the deviant. The ending frame is of a hand descending from above on Peter Lorre as if saying that perfect justice is only possible with God. This is a film full of intelligence and skill. It shouldn't be missed.
B000021Y77|5.0|I borrowed this movie from my friend to kill some time at work and though he had explain the plot; I still loved it! What he told me didn't exactly tell me what to expect.  Espeically how well the music is cordniated with the film.  The speical features include a great video; which is of the lead actress's song. The other features didn't interest me so I didn't check them out.  If you liked the books that you can choose the outcome like go to page 8 or 16 you'll love this movie. I intially watched it in English Dub audio but the lips were totally off and the voices sounded so weird, so I watched in German with English subtitles.  I didn't mind the subtitles. I do enjoy forgein films, so if you like them too, buying this DVD would be a great addition.
068484267X|5.0|I love family dramas and reading this book made me feel like one of the family. McCourt includes all the joys and miseries that a <br />family goes through, and I was right there along with them through it all. <br /> <br />           The location switches between the US and Ireland. <br />Angela and Malachy first try to build their family, and finally <br />wind up with four boys. Frank is the oldest, and soon it is time  <br />for him to be the man of the family. The book follows as he looks for ways to bring home the bacon. <br /> <br />                   I'm telling and recommending everyone to <br />read this book. If you do, I'm quite positive that you won't <br />regret it. It might even make you feel lucky. I loved this book <br />and can't wait to read Frank McCourt's Tis. Anyway, I give this <br />book my highest rating of 5 stars:)
B0000CAXIC|5.0|I have huge respect for Dave. He is most probably the best drummer of the 90's, he can really scream (listen to Monkey Wrench and I think you'll agree) and he knows what makes a good album. He makes albums so well that none of his projects (Foo Fighters, Probot) have any bad songs. You can listen to all four Foo Fighters albums all the way through. Especially this one. In my opinion this is the epitome of pop-rock. It pains me to say this because of the sad state that pop-rock is in today. All these crappy MTV darling bands (Good Charlotte, Simple Plan)have ruined the genre and could learn more than a thing or two from Dave and co. That is, if they had any talent. What sets this band apart from the rest is the fact that they know the formula for a perfect pop-rock song but know how to modify it to keep the listener interested, not just churning out 3 power chords endlessly and spitting out \\"I'm 25 and my parents don't understand me\\" lyrics. So go ahead and listen to crappy bands if you please, but just bear in mind that when you do, you kill the hopes of another good band. And when you grow out of your pop phase you will regret not listening to good bands like this and wish there were more of them around
B00004Y7SF|3.0|There are both pros and cons to Christina's first and presumably last attempt at a holiday album. Firstly, if you're expecting this CD to be as good as \\"Stripped\\" or her self-titled, you need to lower those expectations before you even consider buying this. If you are not a Christina fan, and are just looking for some Christmas music, look elsewhere. This is definitely a CD for diehard fans. In addition, it doesn't really sound like a Christmas album, so it's not really going to get you into the spirit of the season. However, for the diehard fan, it's a nice addition to your collection because while none of the songs on this CD match her best work, they all are perfectly good in their own right. Some may not like Christina's take on certain holiday classics, but if you don't mind an artist taking some liberty with older songs, you might find yourself enjoying these holiday songs in a whole new way. It's also true that Christina does need to show a little restraint at times on this album. We all realize she's a very talented singer, but she just seems a little too anxious to prove it here. Finally, keep in mind that while this doesn't live up to the rest of Christina's work, even at her worst, Christina is more talented than many of the other artists out there.

B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Eminem side project where Marshall Mathers returns to the Detroit group that helped launch his fame, teaming up again with cohorts Kon Artis, Bizarre, Swifty (who replaces the murdered Bugz), and Kuniva.  The twenty-one songs on D12 World are essentially exercises in sexism, homophobia, and shoot-em'-up fantasy.  There's no need to call the PC police--D12 can sing what they wish--but on this CD the b&*#!-slapping, gay-bashing (complete with Elton John joke), and gangsta dreams, although meant as jokes, just aren't very funny, even if Eminem and company find this s%@# hilarious.  Eminem's own homophobia and sexism could be (somewhat) ignored on The Marshall Mathers LP because his rants were essentially push-button verbal javelins aimed at white middle-class parents and the media; thus, the cursing, the gay baiting, the woman abusing, all added up to a giant \\"f-you\\" to his critics.  (Note: the second half of The Marshall Mathers LP becomes tiresome because Em's rage and humor fizzles, forcing one to confront the unmasked reality of MM's bigotry).  Only on the TRL-ready \\"My Band\\" does D12 nail its comedic target: Eminem's fame.    Standout Tracks: \\"My Band,\\" \\"Good Die Young\\"    [...]

B0001NBMBC|1.0|Forget the Halloween masks, the paranoid themes (fear of society, fear of women), the inscrutable lyrics (Sample Dumb Lyric #1: \\"She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities / So fragile, yet so devious - she continues to see / Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest / Enter the night that she came home - Forever.\\"  Sample Dumb Lyric #2: \\"All that I wanted are things I had before / All that I needed I've never needed more / All of my questions are answers to my sins / All of my endings are waiting to begin\\")--forget all of that.  Slipknot maggots will greet this record as a masterpiece, so there's little I can say to persuade them otherwise.  For those who feel that I am biased against metal, check out my Probot review where you can read my passionate defense of metal, as well as my listing of its flaws.  Really, I can ignore the shock metal, the theatrics, the stage aliases, and, yes, even those dumb, dumb lyrics.  What I can't ignore is \\"experimentalism\\" mistaken as \\"progress\\".  What I can't ignore are the schizophrenic musical shifts and Corey Taylor's schizophrenic guttural phrasings.   What I can't ignore--and what hurts my review of this band the most--is the CD's snooze factor.  Should crunchy metal really induce an afternoon nap?    For more reviews, visit [...]

B000008HZB|5.0|Just can't say enough about Jeff Lynne. When I first heard the Face The Music album, I was hooked on the ELO sound. When I bought my first serious stereo system, I took Face The Music along with me to the store and played Poker through several amps before making my final choice. On Armchair Theater, you won't find much of the loud ELO of earlier days as Jeff has mellowed with age. The tunes however are mesmerizing. It's one of those rare albums that can be listened to end to end (well, not rare for an ELO album). Jeff is truly a genius and it's an automatic buy for anything he appears on. Two of my more recent purchases with Jeff on them and my two favorite DVD's are the Zoom DVD and the Tribute to George (Harrison) DVD. Jeff is easily the star of both of these gems. On a remotely related note, my 3 favorite bands of all time are ELO, Steely Dan and Alan Parsons Project. When Jeff came out with Zoom a few years ago, I actually knew who Rosie Vela (female singer on Zoom) was as I have an old album of hers called Zazu that was produced by Walter Becker of Steely Dan!
B0001AP12G|5.0|In October 2002, Kanye West, behind-the-scenes master of hits for Jay-z, Alicia Keys, and Talib Kweli, suffered a terrible automobile accident in Los Angeles.  The near-death incident left West with several injuries and his jaw fractured in three places.  Two years later, with the release of his first in-front-of-the-mic debut College Dropout, you won't hear West grumble. On \\"Never Let You Down, West sings,\\"But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye / Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye / First Aaliyah now Romeo must die / I know I got angels watchin me from the other side.\\"  On \\"Through the Wire,\\" a track cut only weeks after the accident, West delivers a clenched-teeth spit, his jaw literally wired shut: \\"In the blink of an eye / his whole life changed / If you could feel how my face felt  / you would know how mace felt / Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt.\\"  Elsewhere, West jokes about near death; he may be man enough to wear his seat belt, but he's also cool enough to rap, \\"I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert / Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp.\\"  And on \\"School Spirit\\": \\"Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead / If I could go through all that and still be breathing / B---- bend over, I'm here for a reason.\\"  In fact, humor runs throughout College Dropout, from wicked skits featuring old fogy teachers and anal retentive young academics to several jibes about women's weaves.  College Dropout will have you laughing, but West's debut is also surprisingly wise and introspective.  On \\"Jesus Walks,\\" West pays glory to God, pointing out the irony that a religious song won't get any airplay, but a rap about b------ and hoes will: \\"So here go my single dawg, radio needs this / They said they could rap about anything except for Jesus / That means guns, sex, lies, videotape / But if I talk about God my record wont get played, huh?\\"  \\"All Falls Down\\" is an honest criticism (West indicts himself as well) of those obsessed with materialism: \\"I say f--- the police, that's how I treat em / We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom / We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em / Things we buy to cover up what's inside.\\"  Other highlights include \\"We Don't Care,\\" an apathetic anthem that celebrates street smarts over school smarts, \\"Family Business,\\" a valentine to an incarcerated relative, and \\"Spaceship,\\" a rapper's dream of escaping a demeaning job at The Gap and hit it big.  Musically, West builds his rap upon old school soul samples, usually sped up with plenty of added beats, although a more recent Lauryn Hill sample is used as the base for \\"All Falls Down.\\"  Guest artists are plenty; Jay-Z, Ludacris, Twista, Mos Def, and others step forward to play second fiddle to West, the star for once.  The only negative about College Dropout is that some of its tracks feel overly long.  \\"The New Workout Plan,\\" \\"Get Em High\\" and \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\" all have their moments, but they also seem to drag.  The album's finale, however, \\"Last Call,\\" stretches well beyond its limits, a four-minute song forced to continue past its natural ending as West narrates (talking, not rapping) every step he took on his path to fame.

B000002URV|4.0|I must have been living under a rock, because I was unaware of any controversy surrounding this CD.  But then again, I rarely pay attention to what anyone says about music, because as an art form it is highly personal and each of us will have likes and dislikes, and regardless of whether the music has minimal originality or is repetitive, as some reviewers seem to think, I enjoy this music.<br /><br />I enjoy the pretentious opening, \\"The Voice of Enigma.\\"  Sultry, sexy Sandra entices you to let yourself fall into the music, to give yourself over to the rhythm and the feeling.  The result of this music is a bit more basic than what Jon Anderson attempted in much of his music where words became part of the music, but it is effective.  This music is best listened to when you want to feel the music and prefer not to think anything more than the emotions of the music.  One minor complaint, the version I have is about 40 minutes long, and the introduction references \\"the next hour.\\"<br /><br />The transition from \\"The Voice of Enigma\\" to the multi-part \\"Principles of Lust\\" is accompanied by Gregorian chants that provide an interesting enhancement of the feeling of Michael Cretu's music.  The beat is repetitive and provides a framework for counterpoints throughout.  The repetition allows exploration of a theme in multiple facets, much like a quilt has a pattern, but the choices made for each element in the pattern provides variety within the pattern.  \\"Sadeness,\\" which has enjoyed air play, is but one part of this interesting composition, and \\"Find Love\\" that is the second part has a much different theme and framework as compared to \\"Sadeness.\\"  The tapestry closes with a reprise to \\"Sadeness\\" that combines elements of the first part and the second part to generate yet more variety to the tapestry.<br /><br />The third selection, \\"Callas Went Away,\\" opens with electronic birds accompanied by other pseudo natural noises.  The music is soothingly mellow and pleasant, but interestingly the pretentiousness that accompanied the introduction and to a certain extent the \\"Principles of Lust\\" does not filter into this selection, and the selection, while great music to fall asleep by or to contemplate the stars, has much less power than some of the other selections.<br /><br />The following track, \\"Mea Culpa,\\" opens with Gregorian chants and drums transitioning into much more power than the previous track.  The beat is much faster and the counterpoint much more pronounced than in any of the previous tracks.  Sandra's French(?) vocals intermixed with Gregorian chants and new age electronica is an interesting mix that works and makes this song one of the highlights of the CD, even better than \\"Sadeness.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Voice and the Snake\\" is a short, experimental number that may vaguely remind you of disturbing chants in horror movies.  While the initial concept is intriguing, the track's only salvation is its brevity, because I find the result disturbing and a touch unpleasant.<br /><br />The previous track has a smooth transition into this track, \\"Knocking on Forbidden Doors,\\" which is reminiscent of the second and third track, yet with some differences.  Perhaps the biggest problem with this track is that it adds little to what was done earlier and starts to sound somewhat repetitive if you listen too closely.<br /><br />I like the introduction to \\"Back to the Rivers of Belief,\\" which has the same tones used in the movie \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\\"  The tones are coupled with electronic sound effects and then Gregorian chants in an interesting way that is consistent with the movie \\"Close Encounters.\\"  The overlong introduction, \\"Way to Eternity,\\" yields to the faster-paced second part, \\"Hallelujah.\\"  The third and final part, \\"The Rivers of Belief\\" is more powerful and finally provides relief to the too long \\"Hallelujah.\\"  The third part of this song could have been longer and the first two parts shorter to have created a stronger composition.<br /><br />This music is interesting and enjoyable, but Cretu sometimes explores ideas too long and when I am focused on the music I start to wonder why he waited so long to advance the theme.  However, regardless of my complaints, it is the novelty of the music and its high moments that make this a good selection for people with eclectic tastes that include progressive rock and new age.  Even with the occasional weak point, this music is great background music for the office, and perhaps when you are out staring at the stars.e, but Cretu sometimes explores ideas too long and when I am focused on the music I start to wonder why he waited so long to advance the theme.

B0001UL7RY|2.0|Anti-Britney, Anti-Christina, whatever.  Avril Lavigne, the new Alanis Morrissette (someone check the water up there in Canada), is as much pop product as Spears/Aguilera-though, as the father of a four-month-old girl (at time of writing), sure, I'd prefer that my daughter listen to Avril (actually, truth be told, I'd prefer that my daughter listen to PJ Harvey, Bikini Kill, Liz Phair, or the Donnas). Lavigne lacks Morrissette's wit, however, and the lyrics on Under My Skin read like angry diary doodles.  Sometimes the doodles are-and I mean not to sound patronizing here-awfully cute, such as when Lavigne sings, \\"I'll sit on my bed alone / Staring at the phone...This is when I start to bite my nails / And clean my room when all else fails.\\"  One can imagine Avril's teenage fans sitting on their beds, listening to Under My Skin, waiting for their boyfriends to call, and when they don't, turning the stereo volume knob just a tad higher.  Overall, though, the lyrics lack focus and depth, but Lavigne's phrasing is surprisingly natural, so as soon as she matures (read: as soon as she experiences the pain of adult relationships), she may very well demand the attention of all thinking people.     On this sophomore CD, Lavigne ditches the Matrix, the hit making duo who penned the songs for her debut, instead turning to fellow Canadians Chantal Kreviazuk and Raine Maida.  Is there a difference?  Not really.  \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" the CD's obvious standout, features the same gooey hooks, sweeping keybs, echoed vocals, and sawing, layered guitars that the Matrix favored on Lavigne's \\"Let Go\\" and Liz Phair's self-titled effort.  \\"He Wasn't\\" is a popish Ramones-and-thus-Donnas-inspired rocker.  Sadly, though, the CD starts strong (\\"Take Me Away,\\" \\"Don't Tell Me,\\"  \\"He Wasn't\\") and ends strong (\\"Freak Out,\\" \\"Slipped Away,\\") but in between the songs sound like filler, filler that will make your toes tap on second or third listen, but filler nonetheless.  Still, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" should be required listening for all teenage girls and boys.  Maybe we should petition to have the song become a public school learning requirement: \\"Don't think that you're charming / the fact that your arm is now around my neck / Got you in my pants / I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget / I'm gonna ask you to stop / Thought I liked you a lot / But I'm really upset, really upset / Get outta my head, get off of my bed / Yeah that's what I said / Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl / The one who throws it all away?\\"    Standout Tracks: \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" \\"He Wasn't.\\"    For more reviews, visit [...]
B0000A118M|5.0|Seriously, how someone can listen to this album and not hear that it is an achievement that soars above what musicians are usually capable of is beyond me.  Simpy put, this is transcedence.  This is true religious experience. <br /> <br />By religious, I am implying that this music does no less than summon the presence of god himself.  No, obviously I don't mean religious in the sense of organized religion (joke).  This is religion in that all of the contradictions of god, man, crisis, joy, reflection and emotion are fused together in the ultimate praise of existence.  Despite all the misery and suffering in the world, one can fall to one's knees and simply be thankful that there is joy at all, and become thankful to simpy live.  This music is both the acknowledgment of this and the catalyst of this feeling in the listener.  It simply is thankfulness. <br /> <br />As such, it is more than just music.  The beauty of such raw power and expression is SPIRITUAL in its nature.  Listening to this album, a man who is caught in the absurdity of life may suddenly find his reason to continue going on. <br /> <br />In regard of technical skill, Coltrane, Tyner, Garisson and Jones were second to none at the time, and even if other muscians have since surpassed individual members of this group in musical technicality, they have also fallen short of producing a similar spiritual experience.  This is right up there with the greatest compositions of all time, from any genre of music.   <br /> <br />If you do not know this album, you are ignorant.  Go and get thee to a record store! <br /> <br />I know I come off like a snob, but I just feel this strongly about the extraordinary achievement of A Love Supreme.
B0001LJCMK|3.0|A word to the wary: The Eagles of Death Metal are not a metal band, so breathe easily; the name is a joke, much like this side project from Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, former front man of Kyuss, legendary hard rock stoner band.  Homme, a guitarist, sets the six-string aside to hit the skins for this record, drumming under his alter ego, Carlo Von Sexron.  \\"I am so lucky to be playing with this drummer right now,\\" Sexron/Homme jokes, admiring Sexron/himself.  Later, when \\"Stacks O' Money\\" begins to fade out, Sexron/Homme tells Sexron/himself, \\"Carlo, drop it again\\" and Sexron obliges by beating away and swift-kicking the song into gear again.  Funny stuff!     Who knows if the band's name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to those real Eagles (I'm reminded of the Warren Zevon quote where Warren described his music as the acoustic Metallica), but Homme certainly aims for 70's FM grooves, although TEODM sound more like a cross between Neil Young and the White Stripes than anything Henley, Frey, & Associates ever wrote.    Surprisingly, despite the gags, TEODM produce some fun (and funny) rock songs, the kind of tunes that conjure up a nostalgia for summer, albeit a summer spent in a smoke-filled van.    Standout Tracks: \\"San Berdoo Sunburn,\\" \\"Whoreboppin\\"    For more reviews, visit [...]
B00030590I|5.0|I think it's one of the best movies to come out in a long time--way, way better than the tripe (mostly) that Hollywood is doing these days. <br /> <br />There are problems, however, with Miramax and their distribution. The US version is edited and dumbed-down from the director's original vision for the film. <br /> <br />So, unfortunately, if you buy the DVD here, or even view the movie in a US theatre, you're not seeing what the director intended. <br /> <br />Please consider hunting down and purchasing the extended Chinese release instead. (It is completely legal.) <br /> <br />Read more here: <br /> <br />[...] <br />[...]
B0001LJC2K|2.0|This English trio is a Radiohead imitator--which is fine, of course.  There's room on the bus for groups that can mimic another's sound if they can pull it off (ELO's Beatlesesque pop and the Feelies' Velvet Underground-charged tunes come to mind).  However, Muse, unlike Radiohead, doesn't temper their progressive rock obsession with art school know-how.  Whereas Thom Yorke and company believe--whether it's true or not is another question--that they are reinventing progressive rock for a post-punk generation, the guys from Muse define retrogradation.  Not recommended.    For more reviews, visit [...]
068987474X|5.0|I put this book into action this week. The guy I've been seeing for the last few months kept telling me he was into me, said he wanted to get to know me, keep seeing me, but I was often left wondering why I felt confused. This book helped me to realize that his actions were not supporting his words. Asking *me* to call *him*, hanging out more as friends, disappearing for a week: I made excuses for all these things because I really, really liked him and genuinely felt that he liked me too. I think he did, but after I read this book I confronted him and told him I couldn't do this anymore. He confessed he wasn't ready for a relationship. <br /> <br />To all the angry reviewers here, I do agree that in hindsight you can see that a guy isn't into you. But when you truly feel there's a connection, when you really like the guy, it can be damn hard to see the signs that it's really not going to work when you're in the middle of it. <br /> <br />Granted, some of the advice I didn't like. I think a girl making the first move is fine. Why put all the pressure on the guy? And I don't want to sit around waiting for a guy to ask me out. Give me a break. I also agree with a male reviewer who said that any guy that pursues a girl with a high level of intensity that leaves no doubt as to whether he likes the girl probably has problems, or may be needy. There's so much in the beginning of a relationship that isn't clear cut and people make mistakes so a little ambiguity in the beginning of dating is probably ok. <br /> <br />But overall, this book reinforced for me that my time is precious, I am worth affectionate attention, and that I don't have to let a guy work out his issues on my time if I don't want him too. . . . This week I left that all behind and that was *well worth* the price of this book.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The book was by far my favorite of the Harry Potter series so I was so excited to see the movie, but I was sadly disappointed.  The film makers left out a HUGE part that was in the book that I was most excited about seeing.  (For those who are have not read the 3rd book I don't want to ruin it for you)  I can though understand that the movie would have ended up being 4 hours long, but Gone With the Wind is 4 hours long, and people could have definitely sat through Harry Potter for that long.   <br />Aside from what I didn't like about the movie, I love seeing how all the actors have grown up as compared to the first movie.  Even Draco Malfoy is looking pretty cute. lol :)
B000031WYP|5.0|I think the story of this famous opera needs no telling. It is very accessible and very exciting....and it's short. All in all, a brilliant package.    The singers, however, are paired with one of my favourite conductors of all time. Herbert von Karajan has been criticised for making his music \\"too beautiful\\". Well, for me there can be no such thing. His conducting here is typically sensitive and his devotion to the singers was just pure genius. The chorus is excellent and their hymn with Santuzza goes the full way in making the audience sympathetic to the circumstances leading to her drastic actions.    So we come to Santuzza. Fiorenza Cossotto is one of those singers who give it her all. You hear it in her voice. She can rise, soar and float her notes like a warm current as well as stop your world with her chest register. Naturally, she excels in both mezzo and soprano roles. Not to eclipse her esteemed art, I would concur that she is every bit as astounding as the great Simionato.    Allegri's Mama Lucia seems an improvement over all the others I've heard. Not a wobbly, fruity note in sight, yet not the sort of melo-drama to leave you feeling overindulged. Her \\"Aiutateci noi...\\" for example, feels genuinely 'winded'- like someone who has heard the sort of new to make her quietly sit down. To complete the female protagonists, Martino's Lola made me applaud the CD-player as if it were a live performance! There she came along, singing sweetly, only to be caught unawares...in other words, the vocal acting and singing were excellent. BUT it get's better. The exchange with Santuzza (and here Cossoto deserves even more high praise) builds to an electrifying tension that gets released in sheer genius: Martino's \\"Io me ne vado\\"! I dare you not to laugh at the cat-fight metaphor when you listen to it!!    Bergonzi has always been a reliable tenor for me...in fact, perhaps more than that. While I can't claim that he was particularly amazing, he was amazing nonetheless. HisTurridu is faultless...I only wish I hadn't heard Bjorling! But these should not be reasons to under-rate a great singer. Once again, Bergonzi gives a wholly Italian and aesthetically appealing performance. Nowhere is this more apparent than the cavatina at the beginning.    Finally, Guelfi's Alfio, with his resonant, secure baritone, is simply dashing. He colours his voice superbly (e.g., \\"Io me ne vado\\").    This is for me a first choice.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Quit being bitter because you're private little punk band got better.  I have been listening to blink for seven years and they have only progressed.  Personally i think this album is the best they have, but not by much because they are all genius.  This cd should be played loud and straight through.
B000002JOH|4.0|An essential album in any collection.....one of 'metals' finest moments.  <br /> <br />Devastatingly heavy and remorseless for the most, 'Vulgar...' does contain rich melodic moments to give you time to breathe. The rhythm section displays some of the finest grooves that would get the sleepiest of corpses moshing. The only word to describe the outcome of this four piece during this time in their career is POWER! <br /> <br />Vocally, Phil Anselmo blends growling angst with surprisingly sharp and intellegent lyrics.  He mixes this amoungst his last truly melodic vocal effort with Pantera on emotional tracks such as 'Hollow'.  <br /> <br />'Vular Display Of Power' is the first album to contain a true and consistant tradmark sound from Pantera and unlike all releases before or after, has no weak tracks or mediocre moments. <br /> <br />Inlight of the tragic events that prematurely took the genius guitarist who graces this album from our world, (Dimebag Darrell R.I.P.), it is a testament to music in general that his magic was captured here on 'Vulgar...' and will be perminant forever more. His physical form may have passed over but his brutal tone, flowing notes and uninhibited musical attitude will remain immortal.  <br /> <br />Godspeed buddy and thanks for the soundtrack to my teen years.
B000002JOH|5.0|I can still remember when i 1st heard Pantera! they were supporting megadeth!  I was totally blown away with them and i bought vulgar display of power the next day!  the power of the record is awsome. songs such as this love , walk, f**king hostile are still amazing! Its funky and it rocks so hard!  Its my favorite Pantera cd and one of my favorite metal cds ever! <br />RIP Dimebag! You won't be forgoten!!! <br />
6301334345|4.0|One producer stated that this movie was the best of its decade.  I agreed.  The subject matter was explosive, but not as much as in the book Mary Winstead wrote almost a decade after the movie was released.  In it, she searches for the truth of what happen in her father's homestate of Mississippi. <br />     <br />She simplifies the location of this horrific crime which happened on June 21, 1964, because as she said, 'the nation had ignored what was happening there for more than a century.' \\"Ever since the Civil War, the South has had people pointing fingers at them and telling them they're wrong and there's naturally resentment. Nobody likes that.\\"  <br /> <br />She claims that her fidelity to her Southern heritage allowed her to \\"explore the roots of hatred, fear, and ignorance which caused people to commit the unthinkable in the context of a family, a community and even a nation that didn't want to admit it was happening.\\" She feels guilty in a way, writing \\"If I could, I'd erase all the painful things discovered in my family.\\" Her assertion that the residents there in Meridian believed that the whole thing was a \\"hoax,\\" is interesting.  <br /> <br />Her father's secretiveness about his past and family in Mississippi was a necessary evil, even though he had left that area in 1940. She'd visited her relatives there first when she was thirteen years old; fourteen years later, she returns with her young children. This time, they came through Memphis, TN, in 1982 when Knoxville had the World's Fair. <br /> <br />Her father, coming from rural Mississippi, had an unsatisfied wanderlust and gambled to cover his restlessness and feeling of being unanchored, so far away from his life on the farm a thousand miles south if you follow the map through Louisiana. She tells the family history of her father in fragments, visualizing photographs, and using a selective memory behind the wall of consciousness hiding pertinent secret facts. The cover photo shows a typical small townin the South. It could be many places but, with the railroad track beside the main part of town, I think of Tullahoma, TN, where they have the same phenomenon for several blocks in the middle of town. <br /> <br />The obsolete places where you could order all the fried catfish (there's nothing better!) you could eat are still alive and thriving in North Alabama, just across the TN line. Of course, the price is no longer just a dollar! Her description of a long gone roadhouse without a name, just the word CAFE stenciled in big letters across the side could be in Middlesboro, KY, today. <br /> <br />Like me, she had the false impression that antebellum meant a big Southern plantation house with tall white pillars across the front. After all, that's the way the South was presented in the movie, 'Gone With the Wind.' In Knoxville, an old brick building downtown (no pillars anywhere) is being renovated to its original shape, and I was told it was one of the few existing antebellum houses left standing in this town. I couldn't believe it, as it was as far from a plantation home as anything could be. My source, a history researcher, explained that antebellum means \\"before the (Civil) war.\\" How foolish I felt. But that's the image her father drew with his comment, \\"The closest we ever got to antebellum.\\" <br /> <br />Since I am a KAT bus rider, I could appreciate her version of how her mother got around her hometown (when the father was not playing Chauffeur): the #6 bus would take her north to her mother's in Linden Hills, or on downtown to the doctor's office and other places she frequented; southward, it went to a Mall in Edina, where her father worked. <br /> <br />She speaks of living on the right side of the tracks and described one of the racial demarcation lines, separating the whites from the blacks. Even though Knoxville is in the South, I too grew up in a segregated environment not so different from hers. She grew up in Minneapolis in the 1950-60s, and recalls \\"I'd had no firsthand contact with anyone of color.\\" Her awareness of racial issues was limited to what she saw on television. But Mississippi apparently was different. <br /> <br />She relates how bootlegging was under the control of the sheriff's office for decades, delivering liquor to the roadhouses in the trunks of patrol cars -- and how rapes, murders and other crimes were ignored or not investigated. If local history is correct, this town where I lived almost drown in the liquor industry in those early years. Now, it seems to be getting legal again as many drinking places are on the main street of town and the drinkers sit out on the sidewalk to partake of their favorite beverage. <br /> <br />She had to delve deeply and cause bad feelings in her search for the truth, a truth better left hidden. In 1997, researching her heritage, she discovers 'parts of the family history that everyone would just as soon forget.' When delving too deeply, she learned secrets about the civil rights murder which had happened thirty years earlier, she was snubbed by her father's family. So why did she persist? What is right about revealing injustices from a personal viewpoint with embarrassing family secrets? What's the purpose of airing 'dirty laundry' in public -- most families have if you look deep enough.  <br />  <br />This memoir written by an English teacher in her hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, is disturbing as she looks back at her paternal roots in Mississippi and considers the South as being the same as the homeplace of her father. <br /> <br />To show that the turbulent times as depicted in this movie still existed much later in time, I have used this means to fulfill a goal.
B000002UZ1|5.0|The good thing about this album is it has wonderful, wonderful songs. The problem is some are still missing. It simply does not work to make a Beatles collection.Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE NO(or very, very few)BAD BEATLES SONGS!None the less this is a great album, but I would recommend buying the seprate Beatles album.That way you wont miss out on any great songs. <br />              A great album none the less......
B00000JNO1|5.0|NUTHIN' FANCY is in a tie with SECOND HELPING, STREET SURVIVORS, ONE MORE FROM THE ROAD, the boxed set, THE ESSENTIAL LYNYRD SKYNYRD, GIMME BACK MY BULLETS, PRONOUNCED, FREEBIRD: THE MOVIE, ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS, GOLD & PLATINUM, and SKYNYRD'S FIRST for the group's best album. The album opens with \\"Saturday Night Special\\", a song that probably did more for gun control than any Sarah Brady speech ever could. Other gems include the riff-rockers \\"On The Hunt\\", which describes for me how I've sometimes felt when I've seen old friends from school at the mall; \\"I'm A Country Boy\\", which extols the values of rural living; and \\"Whiskey Rock-A-Roller\\", which emphasizes that music is good for the soul. Another song here that means a lot to me is \\"Am I Losin'\\", which cuts to the heart of how some fellow alumni have treated me differently since I prioritized my physical-fitness goals above attending food-related functions at my old school. This is an essential Lynyrd Skynyrd purchase, along with the other seven aforementioned albums.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|the only thing that's good about this album is the fact that i can use the hole in the CD for pleasureable purposes.
B00030590I|4.0|Hero is a good movie. People compare it to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. but its better. This movie still could have been better. It was not what I expected.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|In that rare occasion, which actually seems to be happening a lot more, the sequel lives up to the thrill of the first movie. <br /> <br />Very rarely do we see movies where the sequel is an honest continuation of the first movie.  Only in movies like the Matrix and Lord of Rings, where we know there will be a third before we even go see the second.   <br /> <br />In this case, we have an episode in the Jason Bourne character's chronicles.  Living a peaceful life in India, he suddenly realizes he is being chased again.  This is in direct conflict with the agreement he made with his pursuers in the first movie. <br /> <br />He wastes no time in showing them that coming after him is a huge mistake.  Plots twists abound as he uncovers the reason someone is suddenly trying to kill him again.  The action is intense, the story moves fast and we always left guessing. <br /> <br />There isn't a lot to do as far as intense acting goes, but all actors make the most of what they have.  Brian Cox is always good and he is no different here.  Joan Allen, also reliable in all roles, makes a strong and commanding presence as the woman determined to find out more about Bourne.  Damon is great, always with a look of determination mixed with a bit of confusion. <br /> <br />This is a great spy/action thriller with great performances and enough action to leave you exhausted.  Highly recommended.

B00067BBQE|2.0|When is a live show not a live show? When the editor is an ADHD sufferer who forgets to take his ritalin. After 15 minutes of watching this dvd I gave up the forlorn hope of seeing at least 3 consecutive seconds of guitar playing, singing or drumming. After 20 minutes I was in danger of having a seizure. After 25 minutes I turned off the TV, put on the cd, closed my eyes and imagined I was watching them. Hard to give a proper score because there are two products. So I'd give the cd 3 and the dvd 0.

B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a great movie!  Many people say that there is to much love in this movie. And they say this love ruens the film.   This is not true.  The love is just beautifully done.   When I first saw this movie, I was blown away by it. Not only by the lovescenes (which are beautiful!), but also by the battlesequens (perfectly done), the emotion and the actors.    Ben Affleck does a good job playing Rafe. Also Josh Hartnett does a great job as Rafe's best friend Danny. You can really feel that there is a connection between the two during the movie.    Kate Beckinsale (wow) is  just perfect for this rol. She plays it with much sweetness and emotion.      And then, the battlesequences.   ILM (Industrial Light + Magic) has done a maqnificent job by creating the visual effects. But not all is done by the visual department. Also real explosions, real planes, and (believe it or not) a real capsicing of a ship are in this movie.     Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have done just a fantastic job! Many people say that this movie has failed.  But I think it didn't.   This is still one of the greatest movies I have seen. When I see it standing between the other DvDs, I am proud to own it.   Two thumbs up.
B00005A46T|3.0|I have never owned this album, but I have over the course of the album's existence came across listening to every song on the album. I have listened to their previous album and the one after this and can safely say that this is their best album, as their debut is like Korn worship with some Limp Bizkit-esque elements thrown in and Vol. 3 (and all I heard of their most recent) is inconsistent and tries to be like Corey and Jim's Stone Sour mixed in with tracks that slightly resemble the aggression of their past works.    \\"People=$h!t,\\" the first actual song on the album, begins with a death metal tremolo picking riff and fast, agressive drumming. It wouldn't sound out of place to hear a voice as aggressive as Frank Mullen or Barney Greenway's to just come in and assault the track, but with the title of the song and the fact that it's Slipknot, you know it's going to have some ridiculous vocals. When the 1st verse comes in, you begin to hear the downtuned groove riff reminiscent of Korn and some of Corey's hilariously ridiculous lyrics. Overall the rest of the song is pure aggression in the same speed as \\"(sic)\\" from their debut.     The next song, \\"Disasterpiece,\\" starts off thrashing until Corey comes in with one of the most wannabe terrifying lyrics in his entire discography. Then we reach the chorus with Corey chanting \\"Noises Noises people make noises\\" which at that point I had to skip because it is so ridiculous.    \\"My Plague\\" is practically typical self-titled insturmentation with more aggressive vocals from Corey and the typical sing-along chorus that Corey typically presents in the previous album.    \\"Heretic Anthem\\" has hilariously bad lyrics such as \\"if you're 555 than i'm 666.\\" Has a good intro though with typical pseudo-thrash.    The next track is a typical Slipknot angst teen anthem, but \\"Gently\\" is creepy, long, and at times unneccessary. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention that it's repetitive.    \\"Left Behind\\" is the radio-friendly track on this album,with all of the aggression watered down from the previous tracks and more clean singing presented.    \\"Shape\\" has a typical Slipknot song repetition, beginning with guitars with a little high hat with Corey coming in screaming \\"Destroy!\\" Then it goes into that same riff with more drumming equipped. Then it goes into a clean verse and then a very aggressive chorus and then another verse and chorus. And then we have the most hilariously funny bridge with Corey screaming \\"I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE! EVERYTHING'S $H!T!\\" followed by nu-metal styled vocals.    \\"I Am Hated\\" can be described using two words that are hyphenated together: nu-metal. For the most part it's short and at times reminds me of a more heavier version of \\"Spit it Out.\\"    \\"Skin Ticket\\" is doomy to sum it all up in one word. It's extremely slow at parts and just sounds creepy. Not really that great.    \\"New Abortion\\" is in the same vein as all the other heavy tracks on this album. So is \\"Metabolic.\\" And finally \\"Iowa\\" is the epically long closer that includes some of Corey's most \\"meaningful\\" lyrics and therefore the album ends with that.    Most of the songs have the same exact layout to them and have the same exact style bridge.    Overall, it's not that great. The only highlight of the entire album is Joey's drumming. Everything else is mediocre or pure suck. I used to appreciate this years ago, but then I discovered that there are better bands out there. Also, I know this is kind of a late review, but I decided to review it just to look back at something that was once amazing to me. If you want something that sounds angry, has occassional clean vocals, and doesn't suck, then go and check out some of Strapping Young Lad's albums or better yet, listen to some Slayer.
0321146530|5.0|This is a short and fast read. You regret it that the book is already finished. <br /> <br />This is one of the few books where you read about the authors' misconceptions and mistakes - not about the glorious final elegant solution at the end. Usually this is pretty annoying, not with this author (and also not with Martin Fowler). It is pure enjoyment to be taken along the intellectual journeys of writing a program with Kent Beck.  <br /> <br />So read it and have fun. <br />
0441003257|1.0|I can't understand all the great reviews for this novel!?  I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan, so I was expecting a lot when he teamed up with his well reputed friend, Pratchett.  Prachett is very well known for his \\"Discworld\\" series, which I was planning on getting to eventually, but I'm not so certain now.<br /><br />This book tries way too hard to be \\"wacky\\".  There is no naturalness to the flow of the humor.  Speaking of which, there is no naturalness to the pivotal character, \\"the anti-christ\\".<br /><br />They write \\"Adam\\" and his three friends extremely poorly.  They write them as how adults, who haven't seen a kid since they were one, think a wacky pack of seven year olds might act (they are eleven, but the authors put them at the maturity level of seven year olds).<br /><br />I'll give the first \\"Discworld\\" novel a chance, but if starts off with the same tone as this book, I'll put it down very quickly.<br /><br />BTW, some people are comparing the humor in this book to Douglas Adams???  I don't see where.  It doesn't even resemble poorly done Douglas Adams work.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Well, however much I will say that I think Britney Spears is very attractive when she has on her make up and cute outfits, I have to say it is so pathetic that she would come out with a greatest hits album so soon in her \\"career\\". <br /> <br />I wont lie and say that I dont like to listen to Britney when I am wanting to hear something that wont make me think.  With tracks like \\"TOXIC\\" and \\"BREATHE ON ME\\" I dont mind listening to when Im about to roll, or get hyped up because it really is mindless silly music.    <br /> <br />The fact that Britney cant sing doesnt seem to matter in the industry that is based only on image!  No one seems to care that Britney can never hold a real vocal ability.   At least when Madonna was doing it she sang about real issues and her music was witty and intelligent.   The songs on this \\"GREATEST HITS\\" album is completely shallow and mindless. <br /> <br />While I will admit that she has a pretty good hustle going on, and cant say I wouldnt have done the same thing to her fans that she has done, which is exploit them...  I will say that she has no real talent, no singing ability, basic dance moves, bad taste in clothes most of the time, and tends to let her white trash behavoir show through WAY TO MUCH!... <br /> <br />I would recommend downloading these songs because its not worth the money, and certainly not worth giving her any support!
B0002G2B2M|5.0|The brilliant, creative mind of writer Charlie Kaufman and the able direction of Michel Gondry guided an all star cast in a totally unique type of romantic dramatic comedy.<br /><br />Jim Carey, again proves his versatility in portraying Joel Barish, a shy introverted guy who falls for a flaky extroverted gal Clementine who he meets on the beach in Montauk.  Kate Winslet does a terrific job playing the often times out of control wacko Clementine, who appears to be the diametric opposite of Barish.<br /><br />The fun starts when Winslet, tiring of their rocky relationship undergoes an experimental procedure to totally erase Carey from her memory.  Carey freaks out and in spite also seeks out Dr. Mierzwiak, the inventor of this technology, well played by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson.  He desires to have Winslet also purged from his memory.  During the procedure, Carey gets second thoughts and while bit by bit of his memory is being erased, he starts changing his mind about doing it.  Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are hysterical as Dr. M's technical associates. While reliving memories about to be expunged, Carey decides that he deeply cares for Winslet.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" was an exhilirating movie experience.  I particularly enjoy the effect of having Carey's character come out from behind the camera to observe the plot of the movie within the movie.  This appears to be a staple of Kaufman plots as in his also fabulous flick \\"Adaptation\\"

B0000B1OE7|5.0|Anyone who has anything bad to say about this is just plain dumb. Too much violence, sex?  blah blah blah, Who ever said anime was for kids? Only western people would think this way watching bugs bunny and crap, and even then there's violence in american cartoons like blowing characters up and such, they just don't show blood or make it realistic.  Anyhow, most western people would not understand the ideas and stories from asia for obvious reasons, they're not asian! They're raised in a white western culture. Just the same, people in asia wouldn't understand things about western folks.  Anyhow, the great thing about anime is they're for mature audiences, these kind of movies, they ain't no  Disney so don't be expecting that.  Most are beyond the comprehension of younger audiences.  But in any case, take it for what it is and that's entertainment. Ninja scroll has nonstop action and excitement. So if you looking for a cool anime to watch this is the ticket.
B000268QB2|5.0|I really loved this CD.  I believe it's one of the best music purchases I've made in years.  Their music is fresh and unique to them.  I really couldn't compare them with anyone.  I'd even like to the be the first person to say that I don't see the big similarity between Keane & Coldplay.  I have CDs from them both and I've found Coldplay to be lacking in Energy.  So if I were to compare the two bands, I'd put Keane several notches above.  The songwriting is more creative and holds my interest so much better.  Also the vocals for Keane are much smoother and have such an honestly about them.  With Coldplay, even though I do like them, I feel like the CD is just one big long song without enough difference in sound from one to the next.  For me it gets monotonic after while.  Keane on the other hand has made each song unique and as impressise as the last.  It's one of the few CD's that I own that I enjoy listening to from start to finish.  That is hard to find in any CD today.  So I would absolutey recommend this CD.

0440237688|5.0|I read Lois Lowry's The Giver because my son, a fifth grader, will be reading it in his Language Arts class.  I was not expecting much, but I was completely surprised--It was captivating.  Ms. Lowry has written a book that tackles the issues of diversity, responsibility, and honesty for all readers--young and old. <br /> <br />The book's setting is a socially engineered village where outward uniformity, discipline, and manners are the overriding virtues.  Different colors are not visible or understood to the villagers because they underscore diversity.  Although there is a stated concern for precise and polite speech, euphemisms are used abundantly by the villagers and their leaders to hide the less attractive truths of the their society.  Children do not celebrate individual birthdays, but each year a proscribed set of responsibilities and privileges are granted to the children of an age group in the Ceremony.  In the twelfth year, children begin their training for adult jobs selected for them by the Elders.  The village's surface is calm, but Jonas, the protagonist, has to decide if he should shatter the community's society by using what he has been given in his training for adulthood. <br /> <br />I am anticipating interesting discussions at our family dinner table when my son begins to read this book for class.
1558908382|4.0|Grosse Point Blank is a must for anyone into alternative stylish witty satire.  John Cusack (Blank) is a hitman back for his 10th high school reunion and to reunite with Minnie Driver, the girl he deserted.  Alan Arkin is has a role as Blank's therapist.  This is chock full of off-the-wall humor that take Tarantino's over-the-top methods to the next level.<br /><br />  Dan Akroyd also lends his high-level comic skill as Blank's rival, waiting for him to get his next target, so Akroyd can get him.
B000002J20|3.0|Most of the reviewrs here seem to either love this album or hate it. I fall somewhere in between. <br /> <br />This album is imaginative, beatifully played and richly complex. <br /> <br />All 4 of the songs are over long and sound as if they have been padded, most especially the middle 2 which should probably be about 2/3 the length.  <br /> <br />This album was produced in the days of vinyl and I have a strong suspicion that the limitations of the format may have influenced the outcome of this album and forced compromises which hurt it. Specifically, they had an idea for an album made of 4 long pieces and a total of about an hours good music of varying lengths. But vinyl won't support that. Anything less than 15 minutes a side seems like a rip-off and anything more than 20 has to be compressed (and can't be much compressed) and hurts sound quality. So the songs were padded out to make them even lengths that fit a double album. <br /> <br />That's just my opinion - but it would explain why some of the songs seem to have disjointed and inappropriate passages in them surrounded passages of sometime spectacularly beautiful music. <br /> <br />Even given that; you have to understand that this is Yes at their most typical. Jon Anderson said he wanted to create a band that was a cross between Bach and the Beach Boys and this album is the realization of that dream. If you don't have the ear, the patience or the open mindedness to listen to what is essentially classical music played on and written for modern instruments - with complex vocal harmonies used as additional instruments layered into the sound (instead of sitting on top of it) then you're not going to like this album.  <br /> <br />There may be some Yes material you'll enjoy, just as popular music fans will often enjoy some \\"pop classical\\" tunes, but this ain't one of them. This album requires requires work and patience and a good musical ear to appreciate and even then is flawed. <br /> <br />Flawed, but not worthless. And quite possibly still worth the effort. <br /> <br />I think this album is worth having, worth the effort of enjoying and is mostly beatiful with some moments of sublime genious and some passages of disappointing indulgence. If it were reworked to remove the fluff and tighten some of the bridges it could be one of the greatest musical works of all time (not excluding the rennaissance). <br /> <br />
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I would listen to Ken Wilber and Cornel West riff on philosophy, mythology, religion, sociology, psychology, biology and the rest if the DVDs were nothing more than watching the kitchen paint dry.   <br /> <br />The fact that they have a fantastic story to work with is gravy. It's like sitting on the couch watching great movies with your two best friends who also just happen to be two of the most fascinating minds of the past 50 years. <br /> <br />Next time you are in the mood to take in a mind-blowing lecture, save yourself some time and money and pop one of these puppies in, then hang on for a wild ride.  The movies are only part of the adventure! <br /> <br />
1572814349|5.0|What additional well-deserved praise can I lavish on this lovely Tarot?  Even within the Suits themselves, no two cards are alike -- not even remotely.   <br /> <br />Each card is a unique work of art. <br /> <br />I purchased this deck (my 9th, since beginning reading Tarot 13 years ago) last week.  I still have not done an actual reading because I am taking my time studying, absorbing and just plain ENJOYING each card.  Frankly, the entire deck is so brilliantly gorgeous I'm not sure I can bring myself to actually fanning and shuffling them!  But of course I will. <br /> <br />And rest assured the deck stays true to traditional Tarot.   <br /> <br />This is well worth the price -- and that is an understatement.   <br /> <br />My only \\"nitpicks\\" are the Queen of Cups (no blue or blue-green?) card, and in the 2 of Cups the infant has what seems a genuinely peevish expression towards the older child who is reading a book.  Generally traditional Tarot images for the 2 of Cups (in my experience anyway) show children absorbed in their own easy tasks or gently regarding one another.   <br /> <br />Am looking forward to working with this Tarot.

This is the real essence of the genius : his contemporary style<br /><br />Blue Sunday is a smooth ballad filled of memories .<br /><br />The spy is lyrical blues loaded with reminiscences<br /><br />Indian Summer stamps as any other theme the rapture state produced for those promised land devices .<br /><br />Good choice for any listener really interested in those golden years!
B0000VCZKM|3.0|If your in a musical moode this will do. However Its a little long. This was a huge movie in 1982 in terms of cost. Rumors had the production at $60,000,000 today that would be almost over $200,000,000 in production cost alone.  The movie might have been a bigger hit but that summer belong to \\"ET\\".  That movie took the family audience & then \\"The Best Little WHorehouse in Texas\\" when that was released a month later took the musical auidence! For a much better version watch the Disney Version. That one is over  a 1/2 hour shorter and was directed by the same man who did the movie \\"Chicago\\"
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|This is not your typical and smarmy, sickly-sweet Christmas album. Rather, with this CD Jethro Tull have managed to capture in both verse and melody the spirit of giving, sharing, and perfunctory overindulgence that ostensibly goes with the Christmas season, contrasted with the melancholy and flat-out destitution that the less-fortunate among us may actually experience during this time of year. This interplay of content and style are presented against a backdrop of earthly Pagan solstice symbolism, all of which Jethro Tull have managed to integrate as a kind of ecumenical \\"Birthday Card at Christmas,\\" which not incidentally is the title of the introductory track. This combination is daring and bold, if not outright brilliant, and in my estimation they have pulled it off strikingly well. The musicianship, vocals, lyrics, production and overall execution (not to mention outstanding packaging) are commensurate with and at times exceed even Tull's impeccably high standards, showing this to be a band at the top of it's craft. Anderson's vocals, in particular, complete the album by sounding as warmly weathered as the bearded red-suit uncle himself. It's a decidedly Tull exploration of the seasonal space -- an effort that starts strong and improves with subsequent listens. May it continue to play well for you during the holiday season and throughout the year. <br />
B000003TAW|5.0|Unfortunately I was still a country loving bumpkin back when this album first came out (a fact that I rue greatly).  I missed the whole Weezer craze that hit in the mid-90's.  When Pinkerton came out and Weezer fell off the map is when I discovered them.  A kid was selling the Blue Album for $5 and I thought it would be a great way to start a collection of CDs other than Clint Black and so on.  What an eye opener!  The CD was full of upbeat songs with a pop element that I'd never experienced.  Each song was catchy, slightly different, and unique in the fact the band didn't care that they were a bunch of nerds (\\"I've got a twelve sided die\\").  Yet, Weezer wasn't the standard run-of-the-mill pop/alternative band that everyone might paint them as.  The background vocals were very different (Matt Sharp's falcetto is almost hilarious).  The bass lines were unique to the genre.  Songs changed dynamics and the words were relatable.  This is the album to use as a map to how pop albums should be, regardless if it's pop-punk, pop-rock, pop-country, whatever.  It was ground breaking then and remains a staple for those who venture into the waters of the flawless rhythmic band.  Just try to hate it!  You can't, suckers!
B00030590I|5.0|Director Zhan Yimou is a great director of drama. But he has never directed an action film before. So I went into this with some trepidation. But he has shown with 'Hero', that he is an overall great director. This movie was very well cast and directed.<br /><br />Jet Li plays a nameless warrior who presents to the Emperor of Qin the weapons of the three greatest assassins. All of who had sworn to kill him. We are taken on a trip through the stories of the Nameless and how he killed the three assassins. And then once again when the emperor tells us his interpretation of what he perceives happen. Ever perception of the story has its on emotions, visually displayed by its own primary color. The filming is also epic; they were able to use the Chinese army to fill in as extras for the emperor's army.<br /><br />The conflict shows us the emotions involved with what that emperor was trying to do; unite the seven provinces under one rule. It does delve into both side's reasons and how one person's assassin is another's hero. And what we learn is both sides of any conflict have its heroes. But the main theme this movie tries to get across is that it is a great hero who thinks of his land before his own desires.<br /><br />For the martial artist we are treated to Jet Li and Donnie Yen fighting each other. It is a wonderful fight. And I hope we do not have to wait years to see them paired up again. This fight alone is worth watching the movie for.
B00005R2EY|5.0|I am a diehard Radiohead fan and if I had to pick one RH cd to own, it would be this ep.  It is absolutely facinating, the best live stuff I've ever heard.  It is truely amazing how RH took seemingly unperformable songs from Kid A and Amnesiac and adapted them for the stage.  Every song on here actually rivals it's album counterpart, and that's quite a feat considering the songs we're talking about. <br /> <br />The National Anthem breaks in at the beginning, resulting in the most kick ass Radiohead song I've ever heard.  It is followed by the title track I Might Be Wrong, which comes off a strangely hypnotic, head bounce inducing beauty.  Next is a fantastic version of Morning Bell, with haunting, screaming guitars and that perfect snare drum we've all come to love.  Like Spinning Plates is a melancholy masterpiece, trading in the album versions backward samples for a lovely solo piano.  The live version of Idioteque is next, and it is truely one of the most moving RH recordings I've heard.  You can feel the desparation in Thom's voice, and you really get a more solid idea of what he's talking about.  Everything In It's Right Place, a Kid A favorite, is transformed here into a great bass song with endless echoes of voice sampling.  And it's all done live.  Dollars and Cents is amazing here too, much angrier and more solidified than on Amnesiac.  The ep ends with the acoustic song True Love Waits, one of RH's few truely personal and emotional songs, and arguably the best. <br /> <br />Buy this ep!  You will not regret it.
B00004XONN|5.0|What is there to say about this album that hasn't been said already.  If you are a music fan and you want to listen to an ecclectic cd for a long night where you can't sleep or a rainy day this is the CD for you. Oh, and I would pay 15 dollars just to hear  \\"How to Disappear Completely\\".  People said they couldn't beat Ok Computer, well they did.  This CD is simply magical.

B0002YLC24|5.0|I saw this after seeing Before Sunrise, and I'm glad. Gosh, it's beautiful. At some level I really feel like the Julie Delpy character could be me - I guess that's one of the reasons it got to me so much. Don't think I've ever been this moved by a movie. <br /> <br />It's really surprising how 80 minutes of conversation can be so engrossing. The dialogue is extremely well done, I must say. Very natural. <br /> <br />The staircase shot is really one of the most amazing things I've ever seen on film. I feel like I've walked up those stairs. You really feel the tension between the characters - what now? <br />And this isn't cheesy touristy Paris, this is just narrow cobblestone streets bathed in the most beautiful light.  <br /> <br />I think this is the most heartfelt 5 stars I've ever given. Go ahead, see it.
B000001FTA|5.0|Next to Johnny The Fox and Thunder & Lightning this is one of my favorite Thin Lizzy albums. It contains gems like Soldier Of Fortune, Southbound, Dancing In The Moonlight, Dear Lord, and the title track (Downey's drums on fire!). Phil's songwriting is superb and the guitar playing of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson is excellent (I still think Another Perfect Day w/ Brian is Motorhead's best album). Thin Lizzy was a band that put out a string of great albums but unfortunately is only remembered for a couple songs (just like Blue Oyster Cult). Get this great album and enjoy some good music!
B000060K4O|3.0|He really wasn't that big an actor (still isn't to this day) to be billed as one of the top three ghostbusters of this movie. We got a lot of him and not enough of Ackroyd (who was and still is) in this horror comedy caper. Not quite Abott and Costello as this film is highy suggestive in it's humor but that's another point.
B00005QXDD|5.0|\\"Dude, we gotta f***ing write something dude. Come on.\\" starts the funniest album in the history of mankind. If you are a fan of Jack Black then you must buy this. It's funnier then any of his movie roles (which is not easy to do). Along with him is the magnificantly hilarious Kyle Gass, who plays the \\"straight man\\" to Black's over the top performances. <br /> <br />I guarantee you will be hurting from laughing so hard from this album. I literally can repeat this album verbatim, start to finish. It's that great. The humor is a mix of irreverence, silliness and smart satire. The album is packed full of jokes, some you might not catch the first few listens. <br /> <br />Not only is this album funny, the songs are great too. JB and KG could have just put humor first and music second but they put them both up front. The songs are very Dio-esque and a lot of '80s metal influences which goes along perfectly with the humor.  <br /> <br />Buy it. Worship it. Love it. Then burn it and trade it in for 3 bucks at your local record store. Seriously, if you don't think this album is one of the funniest things you've ever heard, I will personally pay for it.

B00009ATIX|5.0|First for the caveats to this review: I haven't read Lem's story, I haven't seen the original Russian film of it, and I haven't read the 264 other reviews currently shown here (though I might work through some of them later), I won't begin to try to summarize the plot, I'm not a particular fan of Lem or science fiction or of the director or any of the actors, and I'm writing this after having watched the film 3 times (very rare for me) over the past 6 months. So with that all out of the way... <br /> <br />I find this film to be excellent for several reasons: a moving and thought provoking story is probably the most obvious, but also excellent understated direction and straightforward, sincere acting are others. Good casting, too, I'd have to say -- you don't spend the movie thinking, oh, I'm watching (actor's name) playing (description of character). Good on-screen chemistry between Clooney and McElhone would be essential to this film, and that comes through, along with the director's interesting treatment of them. It helps that it's also definitely different from the vast majority of other sci-fi or non-sci-fi movies out there in its level of emotion. Part of that difference, and perhaps another reason for its quality, is its ambiguity. If there's one warning that should go out to those considering seeing it, it's that they shouldn't see it if they enjoy clearly defined outcomes.   <br /> <br />The movie grapples courageously with LOSS, which is essentially what it's about, and you forget it's sci-fi almost throughout, except when the occasional unavoidable scene/line reminds you. But you're enveloped in a story about connections between people, how they relate to each other, the sometimes unavoidable selfishness of everyone in their perspectives on the world, and what that can cost. It has gotten richer to me through the subsequent viewings, perhaps because you see more or perhaps because you just have more time to sink into these themes.  <br /> <br />I really cannot understand why people would DISlike this film (unless again they're just searching for something much more straightforward), but I think many would like it, even if they don't normally like science fiction in general, because of the degree of emotion and though and humanity in the story.
B000002JOH|5.0|But I heard one guy say something positive. <br /> <br />Bon Scott, John Bonham, Cliff Burton... now Dime. You guys got one f***ing hell of a supergroup over there... Shake God off of his throne and raise some hell ;)
B0000027RL|5.0|This is really good music <br />great debut from one of the best bands ever!!! <br />from \\"once\\" to \\"release\\" there are no weak moments. <br />This is the kind of album everybody that likes rock must have <br />They have made great records after this one, but this stuff is perfect. <br />Vedder's voice is amazing and the rest of the band did it excellent. <br />Maybe new rockers know PJ because of Riot act and they don't like it, but go out and get \\"Ten\\" and discover this rock treasure Seattle gave us in the early 90's.
0517220784|5.0|The adventures of Sherlock Holmes are as exiting as they are mysterious. This collection of them is nicely packaged into two volumes. The first volume of this collection contains \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", \\"The Sign of Four\\", \\"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\", and \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\". All of these parts contain many plot twists and ingenious observations by Sherlock Holmes. Alongside him is Dr. Watson who catalogues these accounts in first person. The books go through the introduction of Watson and Holmes, to the revealing of Holmes' drug addiction, ending with Watson's marriage, while solving what seems to be the smallest, least important crimes. These grow into the most insidious plots. This is a great read that could be read again and again. It is a must have in any collection.
1401301010|2.0|Very disappointing read.  The book needed a good editor to cut down on the number of times Kiedis describes the tedious process of waiting to cop, copping, drugging and nodding off.  Only broken up by stories about his myriad sexual escapades with women (only under the age of 25 and/or of the model/actress/fashion designer variety except for one patronising paragraph about a fat girl). Don't be expecting any eloquent turns of phrase either. He's selfish, a bit sexist but still very charasmatic.  Save your money and buy his CDs instead.
B0000931OG|5.0|Let me make this clear....I think Graham Coxon is one of the most talented guitarists in a generation. I think without him Blur would have been dead long ago. That said, I cant help but think that 'Think Tank' might be the best Blur album ever. My previous favorite had always been 'Blur' which is the album that Coxen exerted maybe his most influence following his disappointment with the Damon Albarn controlled 'Great Escape'.    'Think Tank' exploded every conception of Albarn that I previously had, that he was maniacal, pop-obsessed, and without soul (compared with Graham). That conception is completely false. This album has more soul than I ever thought Blur was capable of. While yet remaining absolutely accessible (true to Damon) ,there is a kernal of brilliance running throughout the entire length of the record. But the mood and feel of the music is what truly sets it apart. It sounds like an inspirational journey towards happiness. It has an almost Zen-like quality to it that cannot help but calm your senses and create some positivity with you. Even the last track, though dark and somber, it does not detract from the impression of hope  planted throughout the rest of the record.    The musicianship is also astounding, and the guitar sounds, though subtle in most cases, are absolutely original and amazing (played by Damon!). I feel that the band was given some freedom to do something completely different with Coxon's departure and what resulted was visionary and inspired.    Many die-hard Blur fans may disagree, but this album is Blur at their peak.
B000002JOH|5.0|Everyone knows that this is a metal classic so I am not going to say more to the subject.    My main reason for writting this review is to honour Dimebag Darrell for what he has achieved in his life as a musician.  You were an inspiration for many an will sorely be missed.    R.I.P. Dimebag Darrell - I will smoke a fat one for you; in honour and respect!
0312263120|1.0|For all of you who enjoyed Dan Brown's books, \\"even though some of the facts were wrong\\"--Just wait until he writes a novel about your profession.  You'll be just as frustrated at his lies, as were the computer experts, cryptographers, Christians, historians, art experts, etc.   <br /> <br />Imagine if he wrote, \\"The professor pulled the key out of the deep fryer and put it in his pocket.  He then set to the nearly impossible task of deciphering the symbols on the cash register.  If only he could make it through the maze of the ordering line in time...the deep secret of M*Donalds would be exposed.\\" <br /> <br />Then tell me how believable it was.  Any school teacher would flunk this author for poor research, plagarism, and fabrication.   <br /> <br />
0316926345|5.0|In his classic novel \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", British author Evelyn Waugh offers an intimate view of English family life during World War II.  His story revolves around a dying patriarch, Lord Marchmain, and is narrated by his elder daughter Julia's lover, Charles Ryder.  A man notably detached from his emotions, Ryder experiences a dramatic turn-around by novel's end.<br /><br />Ryder's change of heart comes about during the final months of Marchmain's life.  The patriarch himself is not overly concerned with his latest round of failing health and confidently expects to recover.  His son Lord Brideshead (Bridey), however, sees otherwise and summons the local priest Father Mackay to anoint his father.  Not even pretending hospitality, Marchmain has his younger daughter Cordelia spirit the priest out the door.  In the words of his Venetian mistress Cara, Marchmain is a scoffer who disdains the Church.<br /><br />Marchmain's shabby dismissal of Father Mackay sets a negative tone.  Ryder himself chimes in with the sarcastic remark, \\"The witch-doctor has gone.\\"  Skepticism like this, however, provides little comfort to the dying aristocrat.  Even his personal physician can do nothing more than to try to keep his patient alive from day to day.<br /><br />Both Cordelia and Bridey are away when their father's condition takes a sharp turn for the worse.  Julia, on the other hand, is at the estate and promptly goes out to call for Father Mackay.  After she and the priest return, Mackay gets an update from Marchmain's doctor: the patriarch is now semi-comatose.  The priest then goes in to see the dying man and asks him to acknowledge remorse.<br /><br />At first Marchmain does nothing.  Father Mackay anoints him anyway and as he gives him the final blessing, the dying aristocrat surprises everyone by motioning with the sign of the cross.  Marchmain thus makes his peace with God and dies reconciled to the Church.  For Ryder this is like the \\"veil of the temple being rent from top to bottom.\\"  From then on, both he and Julia know instinctively that their affair is over and that they would be leading separate lives.<br />Dennis J.

B000002JNJ|5.0|Darrel Lance Abbott, better known as \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell, was sadly murdered on December 8, 2004, and will be forever remembered. This is the best Pantera album ever, and you should buy it to support Vinnie, the ex-Pantera/Damageplan drummer and Dimebag's brother, as well as Rex Brown, Pat Lachman, Bob Zilla, and Phil Anselmo. After reading this review, please take a moment of silence to remember this guitar god. Listen to \\"Cowboys From Hell,\\" \\"Primal Concrete Sledge,\\" \\"Psycho Holiday,\\" \\"Cemetery Gates,\\" \\"Medicine Man,\\" \\"Art of Shredding,\\" and all the other phenomenal tracks from this album. Goodnight.
B0000797IO|1.0|The beginning of this film gives you hope that it might turn out interesting and thought-provoking.  However, it loses ground about half-way through.   Jennifer Aniston proves once again that she is not a serious actress.  She fails to engage us in her character, Justine.   Even John C. Reilly (usually a very good character actor), who plays Justine's stoner husband, falls flat as he has little to work with.  Jake Gyllenhal is alright as Holden, but they take that character too far out.  The plot is thin and the filmaker leaves us with unanswered questions that seem rather pointless.  The most entertaining parts of this film I found to be the dead-panned announcements over the PA in the discount store where Justine works.
B000025SJ8|5.0|Burzum is in my opinion the best black metal act of all time(although his last two albums are a bit under-par but he did them in jail)I find when I listen to vargs work it almost puts me in a trance it stirs up all kinds of emotions. And vargs vocals can only be described as pure agony. Burzum is dark,violent and above all beautiful.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I hope Good Charlotte and Simple Plan are paying attention. The boys who delivered \\"Dookie\\" are back with their best ever, \\"American Idiot.\\" It addresses the ills found in America today, most notably war and President Bush. It also creates characters and worlds that tie in to the main theme of the album. Simply put, this is the best punk album to come out this year. It demostrates what punk rock should be, but sadly, not what it is. Bands like Good Charlotte are the ones who make me listen to rap, which is MUCH better than rock these days. Green Day has restored everyone's faith in punk with this album.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|I am an avid fan of the Harry Potter series. I own all the books, I've watched all the movies, and I watch anything that just mentions Harry Potter. I know almost everything there is to know about the series that has been released thus far, and I can say in all honesty, do not under any circumstance read the book and then watch the movie. I've read dozens of fanfictions that butcher the story line and not one of those do it to the extent that this movie does. The details are followed closely, but still don't hold up to the original story line. It just doesn't hold a candle to the book. <br /> <br />Now, don't get me wrong. The movie is excellent on it's own. I highly recommend watching it, just not if you've read the book and are incapable of not making comparisons between what's happening on-screen and what happened in the book. The actors are all getting much better as they grow up, the new characters are brilliant, the chemistry is perfect, the characters are portrayed wonderfully, and the new Dumbledore is just as good as the old, (though I'll forever see Dumbledore as Richard Harris. Sorry Sir Micheal.) The movie is a little too fast paced at times. It jumps from one thing to the next so fast at times that the audience is left wondering what just happened. Overall, good movie, just DON'T read the book first, or learn to separate the two.

B0002LU8OU|5.0|Lloyd Cole and the Commotions were formed in Glasgow in 1982 and released \\"Rattlesnakes\\", their debut album, two years later. Despite being praised wildly by the UK's 'indie' music press from the outset, it also proved to be an excellent album. Cleverly written, \\"Rattlesnakes\\" also features more catchy tunes than a debut album is generally entitled to. <br /> <br />For this 20th Anniversary release, the \\"main\\" album has been remastered - though the track listing remains the same. It opens with \\"Perfect Skin\\", one of the band's best known and most fondly remembered songs. (It even merits a mention in \\"The Crow Road\\", by Ian Banks). It's followed directly by the album's title track - a lively number that namechecks Eve Marie Saint and Simone de Beauvoir. It's also one of the songs that benefits hugely from Anne Dudley's superb string arrangements. \\"Mission Street\\" and \\"2cv\\" are a little more introspective, while \\"Forest Fire\\" (I'm reliably informed) features a Bo Diddly drumbeat. \\"Four Flights Up\\" just about makes it as my favorite song on the album - another lively track, the lyrics always make me smile. (\\"Must you tell me all your secrets when it's hard enough to love you knowing nothing ?\\"). <br /> <br />The bonus disc contains 18 tracks, is nearly an hour long and is made up of demos, live tracks, radio sessions, b-sides and an out-take. Only three tracks from the 'main' CD (\\"Down on Mission Street\\", \\"Charlotte Street\\" and \\"Forest Fire\\") don't make a second appearance here. However, the out-take is a track called \\"Beautiful City\\" which was recorded for the original album but dropped. To make up for the oversight, the version that would've made the album and a live version feature. Two of the other live tracks were recorded at Glasgow's Barrowlands - the crowd's reaction to \\"2cv\\" gives some indication to how popular the band were at the time.  <br /> <br />For anyone who's a fan of the band or album, I would definitely recommend picking this up. As well as the bonus CD, it comes with a small booklet the band have put together covering their memories of the songs and recording sessions. (There's even mention of tennis matches against the Sisters of Mercy - who'd have pictured that !?!). However, with or without the extras, \\"Rattlesnakes is simply a must-have album : it doesn't sound twenty years old !
