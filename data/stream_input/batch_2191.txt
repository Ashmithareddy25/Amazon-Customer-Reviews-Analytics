1892005034|5.0|Dr. Rosenberg offers very rich and compelling ideas about our world and how we choose to walk in it among eachother.  He shares touching stories and gives very real examples of human interactions that help the reader to see and better understand how to be more successful in communication and getting ours and others needs met in a cooperative way that could change the world for the better.  I think this book should be required reading in high school!  Thank you, Dr. Rosenberg, for being willing to do the work required to share your insights with the world.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Over the years I've enjoyed watching the 1984 version of THE KARATE KID, but let's be honest, it's just a tad syrupy.  And of course, with its poodle hair-dos and bubblegum musical score, the original is definitely showing its age.  And my indifference, upon learning actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith were going to produce a remake, was acute; after all, don't we all know the story?  So I ran across the 2010 KARATE KID the other night on cable, and pulled up a chair.  The story of a gangly youth in a new environment trying to adjust to his surroundings, being mentored by a caring, yet flawed, senior gentleman, hits the mark as portrayed by Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.  This version takes place in China, where Dre Parker and his mother, Sherry (I love Taraji P. Henson), have just moved from the US.  So what's in store for Dre?  A major cultural adjustment.  And on Dre's first day there, on the playgrounds outside his apartment, he encounters first a romantic interest in Meiying (Wenwen Han), and then a gang of bullies, led by a snarling Cheng (Zhenwei Wang).  Following a handful of profound arse kickings (and the violence is pretty graphic), Dre receives aid from maintenance man Han (Chan), who teaches Dre how to protect himself by mastering kung fu; yet his training regimen, to say the least, is unorthodox.<br /><br />Jaden Smith has inherited the acting chops from his gifted parents, and he delivers a most believable performance as a tormented, beleaguered youth only trying to fit in.  Not to mention his athleticism is staggering; I still can't believe some of the moves I witnessed.  And Jackie Chan turns in, in my opinion, the performance of his career, playing soft-spoken, kindly Han--a man haunted by a most unpleasant past.  Chan's character, even when smiling, reflects a constant pain and sadness, and it's compelling and utterly believable.  The supporting cast is solid, and the story moves swiftly to the climactic martial arts tournament, where the action, for lack of a better word, is astounding.  If Smith doesn't go into acting he darn sure needs to pursue a career in MMA. And with the championship match, between Dre and Cheng--even though we all know what is going to happen--you'll find yourself cheering aloud from your chair. Remakes are often bland and contrived--and this remake does meander at times--yet in this instance, the 2010 version of THE KARATE KID outshines the original.  Jacket on, jacket off.<br />--D.

B00AB0Z88S|5.0|There're lots of 3D movies, and lots of movies with great story lines on the market nowadays. But if you combine the two, most of them either don't have a very terrific story, or have poor 3D technology or the scenes are not so fantastic that you really want 3D for it.<br />So Life of Pi is one of those which you want the 3D version because of the beautiful scenes, and the collector's edition because of the great story.<br />Different from others who focus on which story is true in the movie, I personally don't think that matters. The title of the movie is \\"Life\\" of Pi. I read it as a movie of the life of an Indian boy, also the life of any ordinary person. We were on the big ship with our parents when we were children, and went on our own boat when we grew up. There were many obstacles and dangers in life. And we are fighting with our own fear and sloth all the time. If you don't give up, you will arrive at the shore, which in Buddhism is the metaphor of wisdom and fulfillment of life.<br />I love the story. I love the scenes. And I love Richard Parker (as I am a cat lover!). This is the first movie I will buy the 3D blue-ray collector's edition of.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book!<br />It is now my favorite.<br />I am going to get the second ASAP<br />I recommend this book to everybody.
0240815807|5.0|This book was a great book well written by an author with a quirky sense of humor. Which I like.<br /><br />That being said; there were quite a few typos that were never remedied, but overall I don't think that they comprimised the book's content in any way. Although there were some funny sounding typos here and there.<br /><br />I guess one important factor is to make sure that you know how to track before you try to mix. Unless you have someone tracking for you,  that is. In my instance I had to buy another book immediately afterward regarding the recording engineer's side of the task. And for the record, there are also other books for mastering engineers. But this book is more than adequate for getting the mixing part of recording down to a science. Very helpful.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I really liked the show, but I would suggest for people to wait until all three movies are available and maybe an extended edition. This is considering the Hobbit movies are already extended to begin with.<br /> Gandalf the brown on the cover, instead of Gandalf the grey. The person making the cover must have thought of mixing Radagast and Gandalf together. The movie is a great lead up to Lord of the Rings, I just did not like the idea of the story being told in a flashback style, as one already knows Bilbo Baggins succeeded. The nice thing is you still get lost in the way the story is told and forget about the flashback temporarily. It just seems odd how Peter Jackson is putting so many characters in Lord the Rings into this series. I am guessing it is to have the fans of the show to stay familiar to them, but it is still unnecessary.<br /><br /> If Peter Jackson ever gets the rights to make the Silmarillion, then that one would need more than three movies. The book is about 500 plus pages told in historical writing compared to the around 300 pages of the Hobbit used to have many interactions to develop characters.
B007THA4FI|3.0|AN OK READ!  The book was a little hard to get involved in. Some of the language used was hard to understand, the British slang and wording took away from the storyline.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Although I had DVDs of the trilogy, I am very happy that I purchased the DVD Restoration. It is much clearer in the darker sections and the audio is higher quality throughout.

B009PJXY3M|4.0|My favorite songs were those where Bridgit sang in her natural voice. There were several where she sounded unnatural, like she was trying to do her Brittney Spears impersonation. I think her voice is too beautiful to have to resort to that artificial nonsense. Thankfully, I liked many more of her songs than the ones I disliked. She used a nice variety of styles too so that every song didn't sound the same.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I love it and will add to my costume perfectly. I've never thought myself to be a huge Hello Kitty fan, but I'm starting to really love her!
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Once you accept that Peter Jackson's movie is not faithful to the book, it is not that bad.  It's not great either.  Some of the visual effects are good, but The Hobbit pales next to Lord Of The Rings.  What was Jackson thinking with Radagast the Brown?  On a sled pulled by rabbits no less!  The troll sneezing in the cooking pot and then on Bilbo is just disgusting & adds nothing to the film.  The goblin king is another miss.  The dwarves (dwarfs?) do not look anything like Tolkein's description.  The movie goes on way too long.  The book is around 300 pages & the film covers about 100 pages!  The addition of the prologue showing the arrival of the dragon is good, but on the whole it really is an endurance test.  Imagine if Jackson decided to film War And Peace or Gone With the Wind?  Would he ever complete the film?  Would anyone live long to see the entire film?  Maybe history will eventually treat Jackson  as another Abel Gance or Erich Von Stroheim, but today he is just excessive.  The Hobbit is a good example of what might have been.

0385742886|5.0|The Kill Order is the prequel to the Maze Runner series written by James Dashner.  I have purchased the whole series, and personally think that the Kill Order is the best book of the series.  The Kill Order is about how the disease called the Flare came to be and how it became a bio-weapon used by the group who call themselves WICKED.<br />With The Kill Order, I think Dashner totally accomplished his goal which was to explain and give background information for the questions left unanswered in the first three books. Dashner provides the reader with that ah-ha moment when it is revealed why Thomas was put in the Glade as well as why the Flare was created and how it became the bio-weapon talked about in The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure.  It had a great storyline with several new characters.  Not only did he use new characters, but he executed their roles perfectly by using them as a bridge to the purpose of the \\"munies\\" in possibly finding a cure.<br />The book does have some weaknesses as does any book.  For example, even though it is a prequel, you cannot read The Kill Order before the rest of the trilogy and still understand the plot. There are too many references to the first three books which the reader must have knowledge of before completely understanding the plot. For example, The Kill order references the original \\"gladers\\" and there time in the maze.  Without having read the Maze Runner, the reader would not understand these references. Another thing that disappointed me was that I was hoping to learn more about Thomas and Teresa's past, but that was not explained in this prequel.<br />  However, all its strengths totally make up for its weaknesses. I liked that it clearly explained why the characters Thomas and Teresa were put in the Glade in the first place and put in control of the trials. I also thought it was helpful that the story gave background information about the beginnings of WICKED and the details about the Flare.  For example, in The DeathCure the reader is led to believe that the release of the Flare was accidental, but it in The Kill Order it is discovered that the disease was released on purpose.<br />I rate the book a 9 out of a 10. I would recommend the book to anyone who loves science fiction and lots of action scenes. Dashner does a great job of keeping the reader interested through his use of suspense and by having the characters in constant danger and on the move.  There are \\"Cranks\\" behind every corner and in every cave!
B005URRCUY|5.0|I actually bought this Cd for the second time just to keep it un openned and save it for my collection;  this band has expand my mind on the music field and with this cd they just showed that there are still very talented artist out there working in real &#34;music&#34; not just a industry icon that with cute faces and lame songs can be on the charts.<br />Love the whole cd there is not a song to skip and one of the favs  is Gold on the ceiling!

0399160450|1.0|Reading this book was an effort, a slog through 888 pages (per my Kindle) of unbelievable Cowboy and Indian stuff about a brilliant Chinese hacker who called himself Center who was the evil,  mastermind at the center of a Chinese program to hack into and  paralyze and/or destroy all important American computer programs  to the end that the China could have its way with Taiwan, the South China Sea and American power in the Pacific if not the world. But Center hadn't counted on the skill and bravery of  a few American warriors who would have none of this and particularly on the skill, bravery and unbelievable luck of three or four of them who are apparently well known to Tom Clancy readers and who almost single handily not only took out Center's entire establishment but also succeeded in assassinating the leader of the Chinese military effort as he was riding in his \\"victory\\" parade in the middle of Beijing.<br /><br /> So, you might well ask, why did you read it if it was such a slog? Well, the answer demands an explanation - which is that having read Clancy's Hunt for Red October when it came out nearly thirty years ago I got the impression that he had access to some American Intelligence denied to the general public - namely the mutiny on the ship and more importantly Red October's new propulsion system which eliminated propeller noise, a development which, if true, represented a huge - really huge - advantage to the submarine in anti-submarine warfare (this reader's particular field in WWII). So I thought if Clancy still has that same intelligence access maybe he'll give something away in this book on Chinese hacking of American systems. So I read every page looking for what if anything he might give away. Sorry, there was nothing that we couldn't guess about from the current press reports - yes, our counter measures are a bit behind; yes, our domestic grids might be subject to failure in a worst case scenario; and, yes, there is the suspicion that the Chinese maywell have hacked into some or most sensitive systems. But it was all basically a waste of time and I don't recommend that you try it .<br /><br /> Clancy is not the writer he was 30 years ago. Now he's a hack, a disappointment, a waste or time, still committed to  Cold War themes with China in the place of the Soviets, using ghost writers and content to imposes on his reading public badly written impossible fantasy which belongs in the waste basket rather than on our library shelves.

B00A2BTCXI|3.0|This review is on the DTS surround mix only and for those of you who already know the original album well. The video with illustrations is a nice touch actually, but I will only review the sound mix.<br /><br />I was excited to check out the 5.1 surround mix of 2112, well aware that this type of mix sometimes adds new dimensions and life to old recordings, but sometimes also mean that the music loses \\"Punch\\" and power when the surround mix just separates the instruments in more channels.<br /><br />I actually first checked out the new remastered stereo mix which is awesome with better dynamic and depth than my really old CD. Then I put in the blu-ray and switched audio set up to DTS (as other reviewers have commented, this is not default on the disc for some reason). The intro synth floats around the room nicely with good depth in the sound and I start to look forward to the point when the drums, guitar and bass come in with the classic odd meter riff. But I get utterly disappointed - the bass and kick drums are so weak and thin in the mix that I have to check if my sub woofer is turned on and then switch back to the remastered stereo mix to make sure I am hearing right. Unfortunately, I am. There is simply very little punch to the opening of the Overture in this DTS 5.1 mix. The new stereo mix is so much better. Strangely, this is worst on the Overture and less of an issue in the other parts of 2112. The bass guitar becomes more prominent and has more depth in the other tracks, and even during the other parts of the long title track. You even start hearing the bass better further out in the Overture but the kick drums still lack proper depth and punch.<br /><br />There are some cool and nice use of the 5.1 channels on the guitars and background sound effects throughout the different parts of \\"2112\\". The mellow parts like \\"Discovery\\", \\"Oracle, the Dream\\" and thebeginning of \\"Soliloquy\\" do benefit from the surround mix and greater separation of guitars, vocals and \\"running water effects\\", but the DTS 5.1 mix on the title track is quite a let-down for me.<br /><br />Moving on to the \\"old side 2\\" (for those of you who grew up with vinyl):<br />\\"A passage to Bangkok\\" is better off than 2112 in the surround mix and the bass and kick drums have depth and the song keeps its punch, while the \\"airy atmosphere\\" of this classic piece is enhanced nicely by the surround mix.<br /><br />\\"Twilight Zone\\" also works well in surround, and the mellow chorus in particular where the background whispered voice comes out really nice in the final part of the song.<br /><br />\\"Lessons\\" has a nice combination of electric and acoustic guitars on the verses that come out even better with surround mix and more separation of the different guitar tracks.<br /><br />\\"Tears\\"... WOW! The new surround mix really adds new dimensions to this beautiful and mellow song. Geddy's voice floats in a perfect balance with the different guitars, bass, keyboard and drums. The keyboard strings compliments the song better in this mix, and the mix of the guitars is exquisite. As goes the DTS 5.1 version - this is a real highlight on the album.<br /><br />\\"Something for Nothing\\" opens with the acoustic guitar riff behind you in the surround speakers, then the bass comes in from the front/centre and gets \\"surrounded\\" by the drums - also mainly in the front and centre speakers. It works well and the song keeps its punch.<br /><br />All in all, I have mixed feelings with this surround mix. There are some cool and really nice effects with the suround mix that adds to the enjoyment of this classic, and some songs do benefit a lot from this mix, but the weak and thin bass and kick drums during the Overture is a huge disappointment that took the punch out of the monumental opening of 2112.<br /><br />My three stars is for this DTS HD mix only - needless to say, the original classic album and the remastered stereo mix of the masterpiece 2112 would get the full 5 stars fom me!

My husband kept asking how it was, to which I replied, &#34;not as good as the first one&#34;.  BUT!!!!  Then there was a shocking plot twist, and it ended up being GREAT.  By the end, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the 3rd and final book in the series!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|60s Memphis soul with minimalist arrangements, a stripped-down, tight band, and a real emotor of a female vocal lead.  They’ve lifted whole riffs from Otis, Booker T, et al.  And bits of Amy Winehouse and Brit soul shouters.  Are all the songs originals?  If they are, they are tied to deep roots.  Compared to the Bonnie Raitt album that came out at about the same time, is scrappy better than classy?  I think so!
1596680296|4.0|This book was very helpful in a variety of ways like the heel flap the different ways to join in the round, different ribbing options and so forth.  However, it focused on knitting in with DPNs. Although circulars were mentioned there were no instructions on how to use the circulars. I do love the fact that I can create my own patterns using the basics you are given here. It's a great resource for the sock knitter.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I will not lie; I got this solely because of Journey. Not having great access to the Internet with my PS3 I was ecstatic when I heard about this edition. The bonus features (Making of Journey, Art Galleries, Soundtrack downloads, Commentary) were just further incentive. thatgamecompany has exemplified Art as Game (or perhaps the reverse) with their latest title. It doesn't quite do to go into very much depth here as that would virtually defeat the point of these titles so I'd just say if you're at all interested stop reading this and get it. I mean seriously.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stumbled across this during my free trial of Prime (and this was one of the freebies).  I had never even heard of this book, but it had great reviews, so I tried it.  I LOVED THIS BOOK, and ended up reading all 3 in the series over the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Note:  I don't like &#34;scary&#34; books, and once I got far enough into this book to realize the basic plot, I almost stopped reading because I thought it was going to be gory.  But somehow, the author managed to take a deplorable event (the Hunger Games themselves) and describe it all in vivid detail...without it being scary or gory.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|I get chills, repeatedly, from the start and throughout.  Everything but the Girl leaps back to life in these quiet, wistful, gray and cream pastel portraits of a hopeful but lonely, world-wise voice.  Simple, spare, mainly acoustic folk-pop settings vary, all placing her instantly recognizable and distinctive voice dominantly center stage.  Most are high-quality, memorable songs.  It includes only one standard; only a couple of treacly, seasonal, pop throw-aways.

B005LAII8K|5.0|As stated above, this film blew EVERYTHING out of the water in terms of visual media for me last year. I don't particularly feel like writing out a full critical review here, but suffice it to say my admiration of it could not be higher. All I have to say is that if you want to see what people can do with the medium of film who actually understand what they're working with then this is a worthy choice in my book to check out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book as much as the first two.  It was highly suspenseful, with a crazy plot twist near the end.  I'm so sad that it's the final in the series...I WANT MORE!
B009S2U77C|4.0|A hot, thuggish, steady thrum brings X right back, but the vocals have a softer edge.  Brooding energy churns deep, always threatening to overturn the sliver-thin, calm surface.  Pirate Jennie comes to mind—the turning storm waits just over the horizon.  Jefferson Airplane comes back in the communal Sprechtstimme of dull, gray, hunkering anthems.  Songs are succinct with tight, taut chops throughout.  This album is tougher than my typical fare these days, but it grows on me with every spin.  Adult punks indeed.
B00999DFP0|5.0|The very first episode on the first DVD proved it was a good purchase it had  two scenes that are not shown on syndication that made it worth owning.  Other episodes also have deleted scenes, that explain a lot.
B007HLIUN4|5.0|Everyone should read this - a very interesting read, presents a perspective of what has happened and why some countries are more effective than others with their governance and economies but does not get caught up in political theories. Makes a lot of sense.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Clever, funny, touching and overall bittersweet. The relationship is believable, the characters feel real and there is a streak of dark, gallows in all of the ill characters humour through the whole book, which along with the relationships and love (familial, platonic and romantic) which adds the warm fuzzies to a story otherwise with a dark cloud over it, as must be felt by all cancer survivors and sufferers.
B008C401YG|4.0|At the core is a deep bass voice with raw, quiet, deep emotion.  It can float in a psychic well of solitude, calling out and calling in.  Rowe's voice carries strong hints of Greg Brown, but is smoother and somehow more penetrating (!).  He somehow always feels honest and unselfconscious.  Some songs *demand* attention.  One minute, Rowe is an old soul man, the next a 1950s pop singer, the next a man raging against the storm.  Perhaps he is more a voice of the earth than a singer-songwriter.  Around the voice are varied, simple, apt pop and folk arrangements, from voice+guitar or piano to cheery Jersey power pop to subtle chamber folk.
B005KR6NS6|5.0|Great movie!  I had seen it once before and wanted to be able to watch it again.  Beautiful and inspired.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading Bared to You I had to continue on with the story. Can't wait to see what Gideon and Eva have planned in the next book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much cooler and more addicting than the last temple run. Great graphics, really detailed, and larger monkey!! There is a underground railroad thing that is really tricky, though. You need to get this app!! :)
B002VX0A40|4.0|I like it for it's variety of textures, yet wished it was still set up a little different.  I ordered it for a child who is visually impaired and he doesn't seem to like it as much as I do.  It's a good size.  it has a loop to attach it to other things and it's colorful.
0439023521|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic, I read the whole thing in one day. The writing is well-done, the characters are developed and interesting and the story line is original without feeling forced and overdone.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film shows an amazing and unbelievalble greed among men or people in important positions of the American world of finance.<br />You will understand how the financial world &#34;works&#34; – and I think most people who will understand that will get chocked – and more aware of how to watch out – and perhaps also take part in struggling for different conditions in &#34;running big companies and banks&#34;, an essential part in our daily lives.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I wanted to watch Ain't nobody got time for that but I couldn't search for it or anything.I don't care that it's free.I honestly hate it.Listen to the other guy and don't bother even downloading it. Never mind the one that cost money.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|One word: MASTERPIECE. If you are a Quentin Tarantino movie fan, you will love this film. If you are not a Quentin Tarantino movie fan, you will love this film. If you are a movie fan in any way, you will love this film. The love/revenge story, the historical subject (the truly dark chapter of American history), the superb acting, the superb selection of music (another classic staple of Tarantino), this movie has it all. The critics don't lie, the Academy Awards didn't lie, this film is must see for everyone and worth adding to your collection.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Ordered in November as a Christmas gift, as of feb 15th it no longer works and the return time has expired.  The original Ps3 controller that came with our console works great, so could this one be a fake?
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I had the old X12 headphones that one of my young children unfortunately stepped on, so for my birthday my wife and kids got me this PX21 headset as a replacement and upgrade. Except it wasn't at all. The headphones are smaller and don't cover your ears completely, so you can forget trying to damping surrounding noise. Since they don't actually cover your ears and instead rest on them if you have ear piercings as well they end up pressing them against your ears and head, causing discomfort. The band on top is thinner as well, which means the weight of the phones is getting distributed across a smaller area as well. The quality of the sound isn't any better either. They don't feel sturdy either.
0765325950|4.0|Much anticipated. Disappointing end. Expected more. First book still stands out for me. James Rigney (aka Robert Jordan) is a legend!
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|In typical Quentin Tarantino fashion, you get a masterpiece soundtrack to a masterpiece movie. Tarantino hand selects every song for his movies and he does not believe in creating scores. He always cherry picks the best classics and mixes it with some modern goodies. This soundtrack is no different. I think I played it 100 times the first month I owned it. Well worth the 10 bucks.
B005LAII12|4.0|Ted was a very funny movie. Due to sexual scenes and language throughout I would not recommend kids watching this movie
B000RLKCMI|5.0|Robocop has caught my imagination and kept it over many viewings. From the satirical commercials to the deep questions about what makes a person a person, this movie gives us a good deal to play with. There is violence and action enough for anyone, and maybe a bit too much for some people in spots. We have a hero so great that death didn't take him off the job. We have a dystopian future society that looks a bit too much like ours nowadays - a Detroit that has come true in some ways. The sequels may fall off into nonsense, especially after they lost Peter Weller, but this is one for the ages, if you like sci-fi action.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was ok I didn't know what the best way go to the word hope but anyway it was ok
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love it! My husband too :) oh, I use it, and my husband enjoys the results , lol ! I used to go to gym before, but after having baby, there is no time to leave the house. So only opportunity is exercise at home. Only after first week using the DVD my hubby said that my butt got firmer , LOL! I'm using second level now and I feel my body is getting stronger and leaner.<br />I got this DVD only to get my body stronger and leaner, because 6 month ago I gave birth to my baby and I lost the baby weight already :)<br />Overall, great DVD, but I am not sure if it is possible to lose all the weight it says, because I'm 5'7 and weight 122 lb ( same as pre-baby), so I don't need to loose too much weight, only to gain strength and get my belly and bottom back in shape....<br />Good luck!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game love it... would recommend for any horse lover.. could use more competition levels though that would make it better or even a part 2
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome Addiction...can't get enough of this game. I have family and friends playing against one another (fun) Great game !!!!
B008393Q2O|4.0|very helpful if you forget stuff very easily like i do. Also you don't have to waste paper if you use it!!
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Not the best for details but none are.  Has enough to get you going.  Planning is over rated,  do something.  That seem  to be the bottom line of this book.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book is good read. Classic storytelling and a great look in tort lawsuits and courtroom drama.<br />I would definitely recommend this book
B0084HJE0S|5.0|One can't complain, since it is free (unless it has misinformation, which I don't think is the case). It is worth reading if you're on the fence about whether to learn JavaScript or you want to learn what HTML 5 is about. This could have been made into a blog post, actually.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|A OK game so far just started playing it about 15 minutes ago so far so good going to keep playing it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I gave this book a full 5 stars. It is very rare for me to give a novel all fives but this, this, was a remarkable read. I want to read it over and over again. I do not quite want to tell you any details, but this really shows the meaning of unconditional love. This novel is a drama and the author really gets into the characters. I just could not put this book down. A must read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  Very different style of writing.  Fast paced - you stay up much too late with this book.
157421327X|3.0|This book is too basic for me, I like the other Zentangle book I purchased better-it is more illlustrated and detailed!
B00AESN8XY|1.0|well I would give this pos no stars at all  if I could, but it didn't work plain and simple. every time I opened it I got a message saying unfortunately plague inc stopped working. I downloaded it off google play, for free, and I have been killing the worlds population ever since...... basically amazon app store is trash.... well amazon is trash considering the majority of merchandise sold here is knock off boot legged junk from china.....
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|Its an ok album and certainly not as good as 'EndGame'. I think there's far too many guitar solos on 'Thirteen'...yes, musicians can over-do the guitar solos and lose overall song structure. Its certainly not as heavy as previous few albums. Lets hope the next one is in the same vein as 'EndGame'
B0027MJU00|4.0|I thought Gone Girl moved along faster, but Dark Places is definitely holding my interest.  I recommend it if you like twisted family stories!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great but the Rome upgrade has the Easter egg hunt yeah that is way too hard to get the eggs on the roof of the tunnels but I love that game app much when I bored I get out my kindle and start to play and bammm I'm not bored nomore;)
B007SGM084|5.0|Not just sex but storyline as well. I highly recommend this book. Will probably read again next time to my other half. LOL
0756686970|5.0|My son loves these books.  He is always looking at them and dreaming of being in Star Wars land!  If you have a Star Wars fan, you can't lose with this book.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Finally a film worth watching. It never sagged nor missed a beat, the viewer is engaged from the opening shot to the last take and its a wonderful snippet of the life of Hitchcock that seems to span his whole world. The casting was perfect (Hopkins) except for that of Johansson who never quite convinced me she could exude even a smidgen of Janet Leigh. All I can think to ask is why wasn't this film nominated and a winner of an Oscar? But that's life. Hitchcock would appreciate the irony.
B004XQYBA2|1.0|I really like the app.  HOWEVER, I just found out when waiting in the doctor's office that it requires internet to use.  Why?  I honestly think it's a 5-star app as far as the gameplay goes, but if I can't use it (I usually only play Sudoku to pass the time) then that all means nothing.  1-star
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app for monitoring your battery. Highly recommended! A+++++ Don't hesitate to download as you certainly won't be disappointed with its ease of use and performance!
B001HN6918|5.0|This movie is one of my kids' favorites.  It has a great adoption story in it too, and I like that.
B00008MOD6|3.0|The SACD Hybrid quality sound is good but the packaging is the inexpensive cardboard folding case, if you could even call it a case. Its scraps the cover each time I take it out or return it to my CD wall rack. Most of the new SACD cases are built better than the old plastic CD cases. When purchasing the high end quality SACD and spend the additional money you exspect the case to be of high quality, not a cardboard case.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE getting on Pinterest and this app makes it super easy!!! I also have an ipad and maneuvering around on Pinterest on that is a royal pain!! I just LOVE it with this Kindle app!!! If you have a Kindle and enjoy Pinterest, this app is a must!!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|This app just woke me up.  I don't know how many times I must uncheck the notifications box so I don't get amber alerts from the other side of the state.  They alerts are annoying and not at all useful.  I wouldn't mind the notifications if they were useful.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I highly recommend this true depiction of a really dark time in our history.  We have watched it numerous time, and most enjoyed it after a trip to Gettysburg, PA touring the battlefield.  The acting is superb.
0679720200|1.0|^That pretty much sums things up. I enjoy a lot of books that many think are \\"dry,\\" but this one was just far too much.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great Bond movie. Very suspenseful and action packed. I loved the little glimpse into 007's life before being a secret agent.
B009P13RQY|3.0|If you like The Sword's previous stoner-metal/Sabbath tribute efforts, you'll enjoy this one as well... especially since the better songs on &#34;Apocyphon&#34; recycle the riffs from the better songs on the previous albums.  The Sword pretty much said all they had to say on &#34;The Age of Winters&#34;, in my opinion, and this album doesn't change that opinion.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I highly recommend this true depiction of events that happened in WWII.  You will be surpised and uplifted at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It won't let me get subway surfers Rome . If anyone can give me advice on how to get it let me know!!!!!!! :(

1400069807|5.0|I first read a rather long excerpt of this book at the NY Times website and found it so intriguing I couldn't wait to read the entire book. And boy, was it worth reading - although you might think such a topic would be somewhat dull and boring, Moss makes his vital information into a real page-turner. Although my diet is far away from SAD (the Standard American Diet), I didn't really give much thought to those few processed products I do eat.  Now I feel like I have the ammunition I need to REALLY check labels and not succumb to advertising and misleading labels.<br /><br />Moss gives great, unprecedented entry to the hallowed halls of industrial food processing, with intriguing and enlightening stories about the invention and marketing of some of the most beloved icons of American food production:  Coke, Oreos, Lunchables, Tang, Grape Nuts, etc., etc. ... you will never put any of these questionable 'foods' in your mouth in the future without thinking about the irreparable harm you might be doing to yourself.<br /><br />Perhaps this book will generate enough outrage in the American public to help turn around the obesity/diabetes epidemic and the literally BILLIONS in health care costs we will all need to cough up for - one can only hope.  If you eat - you NEED to read this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Best Masterpiece Classic ever.  Best series on TV.  Great picture and sound on DVD, worth every penny. Be sure to have all three seasons.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|got this for my 6yr old daughter, she loved playing it (and i occasional too!) however after you pass a certain level, to check off the assignments, you will have to buy coins, or hearts or whatever, because the only other way to collect them is to visit &#34; online friends&#34; who also play this game. so we got stuck and i ended up deleting the game from my device. but it was good while it lasted

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham always pleases his readers. When is his next one? Let me know when & what it is called. Thank you.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love this idea of someone traveling backwards and forward in time. So many stories to be told. Hope this has a long run.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.<br />I think that you will enjoy it too.<br />May the odds ever be in your favor! :)
B004J09ONG|5.0|The movie is a really touching one in a way they bring up the cubs with so much love. And they way the cubs reciprocated their love was something amazing...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Gave this as a gift.  Now they have joined in the following!!  Would recommend this series heartily. Acting is superb.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|After viewing the original DVD version, the improved video and audio quality make this a good investment if you like Terminator films and don't want to spend your whole paycheck on some collector's edition.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is a good bingo game, but the action runs slow. If you like bingo...it is good. Would recommend to the bingo lovers

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I am a fan of the matching games, and quick actions. This is a great game for that. I would definitely recommend for fun
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Andrea's new album has a great variety of songs in several different languages. Being familiar with at least a few romance languages will greatly enhance the listening experience; if you only speak English, or only Italian, or only Spanish, you're missing out!<br /><br />Knowing the history of the traditional pop songs that were selected is half the fun. I googled several of the tracks on the album to find out where they originated from, who composed them, who popularized them, etc. I actually discovered a few new artists, whose CDs I also purchased, by following this process. I figure that any artist who is doing an honest rendition of &#34;Perfiida&#34; or &#34;Malafemmena&#34; is likely going to be right in my genre.<br /><br />One of the best things about this album is how it takes old traditional pop songs and breathes new life into them by combining a world-renowned vocal talent in Andrea Bocelli, with 2013-quality professional studio equipment. So if you really liked &#34;La Vie En Rose&#34; as recorded by Edith Piaf (I did, long before listening to this album), you'll love the enriched fidelity of Andrea's duet with Edith.<br /><br />Honestly, Andrea could sing the alphabet and I'd give it 5 stars. But with this album, there is feeling and meaning and history in every song. I'm not going to review every song, but I'll cherry pick my favorites:<br /><br />Perfidia: This is a classic song that has been a part of many cultural building blocks, such as the movie Casablanca, and the founding song of Princeton University's a capella group, the Princeton Nassoons. Bocelli's rendition is... darker than most, with a certain counterpoint levity in the early verses that darkens leading up to the chorus. I also like how the bridge ambles around a bit before repeating the chorus. Being fluent in Spanish really helps enrich the experience; a translation isn't quite the same. You can tell that reverb and careful recording are being used to enhance Bocelli's voice, but that's fine with me -- it sounds great, and not at all artificial.<br /><br />Malafemmena: This one piques my interest because it's only the second song in the Neapolitan language (dialect?) that I know (the other being 'O Sole Mio). I don't know Neapolitan directly, but I am using this song as a means of learning the language, and drawing parallels between it and Spanish (and Italian). The musical arrangement is deep and complex. Definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />Corcovado: A delightful medley in Portuguese (and English!) that evokes deep emotion. Starts slow and picks up a good rhythm. This just demonstrates the lingual range of Bocelli, going from French to Italian to Spanish to Neapolitan to Portuguese to English on the same album.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Eh. It's a dictionary. It's boring. But useful . Hate having to search for certain words. But like I said. It's ok
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I am looking forward to the second book and h as have already pre ordered the second one. The male character is super hot.  In my head anyways.
B009MO5G90|4.0|Lots of action and fight scenes. Well work the buy, especially if you are considering the 3D Blu-Ray which comes with a digital copy.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I have about all of their C.D.s. I really love the selection of songs on this one. I think it is my favorite so far.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This was a well written story that allows the reader to see things from Soong's point of view.  Loved it
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this book! Stayed up late trying to finish Beautiful Disaster till the early morning because it was so addicting like Pigeon And Travis's love. I think its great to watch a character grow through out a book and you could see the changes within Travis. It took him a while and he almost lost Pigeon but the love between them is hard to break. Now with Abby AkA Pigeon you see her trust issues and how hard it is for her to open up to people but she puts her faith in Travis, finally letting someone in and making her believe in love. Seriously loved the ups and downs within the story and cannot wait to read Travis' POV.
B007XF0X6G|3.0|Wrath of the Titans is better than the remake of Clash of the Titans but still just an Okay movie. Better as a rental if you just want to see it but I wanted the 3D version as I'm building out my collection again but with only 3D movies and boxed sets, as well as upgrading some prime movies from DVD.
0307744434|5.0|I received this book as a gift.  It sat unopened for 5 weeks. I would not have bought it myself as it is not in the normal genre of reading I \\"enjoy\\".  From \\"The circus arrives without warning.\\" to \\"You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is the dream.\\", I was a most pleased and excited captive of \\"The Night Circus\\" magic. What a brilliant and enticing journey through the Circus!! I didn't want to put it down, and I didn't want it to end. I was spellbound by each tent, each room I was taken to.  I wanted to open more bottles as Bailey carefully led me through 'Bedtime Stories'.  I so wanted to climb higher in 'Cloud Maze'. I wanted Celia to continue her perfomances. And, so much more!! I find myself wanting to find where the circus is currently located in hopes that I, too, may stand in line at the gate as the sun takes seemingly forever to drop below the horizon.  I will enjoy revisiting this story many times.  5 Stars is easy.  Thank you, Ms Morgenstern!  And thank you to the friend who gifted me this book.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|The DVD's were in good shape, as well as the case. It was a Christmas present for my mother and she has been enjoying the gift immensely!
1616550414|5.0|Got this for the wife, she is a big zelda fan.  She loves it.  And as an old school gamer it brought up things I had long since forgotten, like Zelda was not originality blonde...
B000XJ5TOK|4.0|The original Resident Evil movie play enough homage to the game that it satisfied the gamer in me and was enough of a departure to make it a really interesting movie. From the third movie forward it feel more like the movies influenced the games more so than the other way around. After &#34;Afterlife&#34; these movies are great action movies that seamlessly roll from one into the other.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been playing Minecraft for ever, &amp; when I heard it was available on my device I had to have it. At first it's a little wierd to play but after awhial I was hooked. I would recommend this app to any one who enjoys building, zombies, &amp; blowing yourself up with a creeper.
B000000XBC|5.0|It was in great shape when it finally came just in time for Christmas Day. It was a gift for my father, and he loves it!
1452110581|5.0|Cat poetry is so honest!  If you're a cat lover you will really enjoy reading this adorable book.  Gorgeous color photographs of cats and kittens made me burst with joy.  My cat just stared at me from her spot on the couch.  I think she was jealous I was looking at other cats.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|We just really like BONES! Just glad we could get a complete season reasonably priced! We couldn't find the 5th season in stores anywhere.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's good to search naked girls. I love naked girls. So hot. And naked man. Soooo hot. And naughty. Buy this
B009O07NDY|5.0|I've been listening to this soundtrack a lot since it arrived in the mail. Nothing wrong could be found with it. A great purchase!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|best way to kill time and makes you think too. its a great example of problem solving with out getting a headache.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I'am waiting for third season (I hope).<br /><br />Las actuaciones son excelentes particularmente la del protagonista. Las locaciones y la ambientación es maravillosa. Espero que hagan una tercera parte.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|it is a good help in having a fast sight of the emails, it is good to have it in my kindlefire
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Yes. It was good. The last parts were confusing but the last page was worth it's loved the first and second parts. I will be a better writer for having read this. Thanks to you mr. Pressfield. I am glad you fought resistance and gave us ths book.
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie was bad and they should feel bad. The only good part was the sexy men, especially Alex pettyfer. Other than that it is just awful. No plot at all. Unfortunately the hotness of the cast does not make up for the lack of plot. If you want to see these guys shirtless, YouTube it.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|Amazon shipping SUCKS however.  Took 10 days to get this.  So much for this nonsense &#34;super saver&#34; shipping.  Should be &#34;Super slow&#34; shipping.  I will use normal shipping next time & not worry about buying a quota of $ value to get this &#34;deal&#34;.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|After a long day, my kids wanted to watch something different and I was not about to drive anywhere! NeFlix streaming does not have this title but you did! THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I had 2 of the first ones that came out and loved them because I hate to drag out the vacumn just for a few crumbs or a little dirt-these 2 work even better!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game. There are so many beautiful pictures to chose from. Thank you for chosing this game for us.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was an interesting series. It was a good interpretation of classic myth that was carried forward into an entertaining story.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book is a masterpiece and adventurous, great for pastimes or just to read for fun,<br /> but when you start reading you don't want to stop.
1439181780|4.0|Though inside packaging could have been more supportive, I enjoyed this purchase so much I wanted to share it with others. Amazon was  clearly one of my best options.
B0055S348W|5.0|This app works very well.  If you have WiFi then you'll love this app.  I print from my tablet. It's worth the money.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I never knew such cruelty existed, when I found out how recent it was I was stunned and appalled! The book was slow at first but I'm so glad I stayed with it.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think this app is very well put together. It is a nice minecraft clone but has bigger maps and they are still adding updates to it. The only downside of the demo is the time limit (only like 15 minutes ), you can't change the skins and the fact you can't play multiplayer but the fact of the new community content is a nice touch. I hope this review helped you desire if you are going to get the full version or demo. I'd recommend the full version. Like if you agree to my comment
1451673442|4.0|Although packaging could have been more supportive, I am happy to add this book to my hands on library. Nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has great graphics. Highly entertaining and addictive game play. If you like temple run you need to try this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's cool how you can go to different places.I just want to play it all day long. Subway Surfers Rules!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I am so happy I purchased this book. The twists and turns were delightfully unexpected and intriguing. The surprise ending made me cry.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Love this movie. I was going to rent this movie on just the normal x box app that lets you rent them but it was going to be the same price so I decided to just buy it. It is great quality and a super cute movie.

0321885112|5.0|I love the concept of taking better notes, and seeing Mike's and many other sketch noters is eye opening and inspiring.  I found the Video edition useful, especially watching the live sketch noting session.  You actually get to see how Mike puts the concepts down on the page (and in a REALLY small notebook!  I am amazed at the detail he is able to capture) as the speaker is saying the words.  Fascinating clip which I intend to watch many times.
0596007124|3.0|Plenty of people have commented about the teaching style, and I do not have much to add in that regard. I bought this book as an adjunct to the GoF book, and it serves nicely for me. To put this in context, my favorite chapter in GoF is the second chapter, where they provide the design for an hypothetical editor. Learning and remembering is easier for me when it is tied to something concrete. Like many others, I could do with about 1/2 as much material, but it is easy enough to start skimming when they repeat themselves.<br /><br />Where I feel this book seriously goes astray is in the problems they choose to use. For reasons I don't understand, they choose to illustrate several design patterns for a problem domain they should not be applied to.<br /><br />For example, they illustrate the decorator pattern by designing a solution for calculating the prices for a coffee shop. They start out well, showing a naive explosion of classes (HouseBlendWithWhipAndSoy, DecafWithSteamedMilk, and so on), which is clearly a bad approach. Yet, they still implement a number of classes - 4 different classes for each beverage type, and then a decorator for every additive you might want (mocha, soy, milk, whip, etc). This is clearly silly; can you imagine telling a company that every time they want to add a new drink or drink additive you have to modify code?<br /><br />In the very next chapter we are introduced to the Factory pattern. Before long we are once again writing specialized classes to deal with composition: You have the Pizza class, then the ClamPizza class, a CheezePizza class, a VeggiePizza, and so on. You deal with that with composition (covered in the very first chapter!), not types. What is particularly distressing about this example is that they rightly showed what a maintenance nightmare it would be to have to write a NYStyleCheesePizza, ChicagoStyleCheezePizza, and so on. Again, imagine telling a restaurant owner that every time he wants to introduce a new pizza on the menu that you need to write code and deliver a new application to him. Madness.<br /><br />I anticipate a retort that these are toy problems meant to illustrate the idea. But we use decorator patterns all of the time in the real world, on real problems. Why not use one of those problems in the book? Again, I recall chapter 2 of GoF; their example problem (a text editor) is very real world, very understandable, and yet is no more complicated than the toy problems in this book. This form of OO, where inheritance and types are used as the main tool in the toolbox is what we see out of junior programmers every day, and it just makes for unmaintainable code.<br /><br />I do like the exposition style, but loathe (some of) the examples. I guess that averages out to 3 stars? I dunno. I would not hand this book to a junior programmer for fear of them being led astray. I would hand it to an intermediate programmer whose skills I know with strong caveats about the quality of the examples.<br /><br />class VeggiePizza.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Excellent series!  Emerse yourself into the lives of characters in Lark Rise/Candleford, you won't be sorry.  Lessons of life learned.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I prime borrowed this book to see what all the fuss was about. Turns out Collins is an amazing storyteller. I am immediately reading the next in the series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great Bingo game for all ages..lots of fun, lots of power-ups, can chat while playing with members of FB  from all over the world!
1616550414|5.0|A must have for all the Zelda fans. Good delivery and solid packaging. The first third of the book is about Skyward sword but it is quite interesting to see the conception of the characters.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones are lightweight and get great volume. I had been searching for some that for this criteria and was pleasantly surprised.<br />I ordered two just in case one broke and I'm still on the first pair!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game was really fun. It wasn't so hard that I got mad and Got rid of it but still was a challenge.
B00BESM14U|2.0|Good cast, interesting lowkey sets and lighting, everybody in place, now... nothing. Much. Shy, nerdy guy gets pulled into 'adventure' by hanging around with outcasts. None of it credible, main character is a bore. Everybody mumbles or screams or speaks too fast. Not the worst, but I found it a chore to finish or care. The supporting gay character is much more interesting, a rewrite could make him the main interest, and then you might have something. I guess Hollywood is not ready to think that could be profitable. Dig up and watch 'Moonlight Mile' instead. Now there's a story. [[ASIN:B0087YNJ3G Moonlight Mile]]
B005R2PDL2|5.0|I originally encountered her music at a new massage therapists office.  I found it so relaxing that I have now bought several of her CD's.  This one, however, is still my favorite.  It is one of my standard bedtime relaxation soundtracks!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very sweet love story with a twist of suspense. Not as much of a tear jerked as some of his other works.<br />Enjoyable read :)
B006KX3GXO|1.0|All I was able to do on it was edit other peoples pictures and download some off the Internet. It is a good thing that it was for free.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Star Trek TNG is perfect television.  Solid characters, smart dialog and enjoyable episodes with a morale to each story.  It's too bad that there is not currently a Star Trek series on television to fill this gap.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Excellent quality picture. No problem down streaming. Enjoyed it. A must watch with your family. Not sure where most of it filmed.
0385342063|5.0|Cleverly written and delightfully imagined. Keeps the reader reading. (Footnotes a bit distracting, but fun, and added to the main character's personality.)

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Starting this series wasn't sure if I would like it, but became addicting. I couldn't stop watching. I would watch all day and all night.
1601254679|3.0|Love the binding , if taken care of will last a long long time.<br /><br />This book gives awesome examples of npcs and rules. Makes DM's life easier when trying to pull a story out of thin air.<br /><br />Will recommend to those looking to increase their pathfinder library.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|great,fun game...good job.keep up the tour. i'm loving this spectacular game.also i kinda want the prince character, maybe a reunion would do it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a awesome game I have fun playing it and sometime it's addicting but there is only one problem I don't know how to update it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once again, Suzanne Collins did not dissapoint her readers!  Not only have I read the book, but so has my husband and all four of my kids!
1612191290|5.0|It took me over a month to read this, and I am usually a fast reader. Every few pages I had to stop for a day or more to think about it. It takes time to completely re-order your entire paradigm at the age of 60! Now I feel like I am bursting with creativity and energy and new ideas to promulgate and new approaches to the ever present problem of fixing this messed-up world. I want everyone with a brain to read this book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I got this as a backup for the cable that came with the kindle.  It works as advertised and let's me power up my kindle as required.

055380684X|5.0|if you are a coach or any person who wants to bring out the best in people. you have to read this book and understand that greatness is not born it is develpoed

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very addictive.I love it.On my kindle fire it has the updates on time.I have it on my smart phone too they get the updates at the same time.Now to go rome Rome.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Takes fine pictures but is very glitchy.  Often it can't find my previously taken pics and says file is empty and then I'll go back in another day and pics are there. Odd
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie about an autistic young woman who is inspired to greatness by a devoted mother and exceptional teachers!  This is a true-story and will make you look at autism in a whole new way.
B00992CF6W|1.0|the game was a rip off blockstory is deter a more fun  game it is nothing like the Pc version do not bye
B008220C38|2.0|I saw this film and I was highly disappointed.  The acting was good.  The choreography seemed a bit overly contrived.  The costumes were good, but those were the only good things about this film.<br />This film is about a married woman, Anna, who falls in love with a soldier, Count Vronsky.  Anna  divorces her first husband and he becomes a priest.  But Anna can't handle the constant worry that she goes through while Vronsky is away at battle.  Ultimately she kills herself and her ex-husband, who is a very good man ends up raising the daughter that she had with Vronsky and the son that they had together as if they were both his own children.<br />This movie's plot is nothing more than an exercise in depressing melodrama.  If a person likes that kind of thing then I would highly recommend this film to them.  But, if they don't care for melodrama in general I would recommend that they never watch this film.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I was expecting way better based off of all the fab reviews.  I did t make it past the third chapter because I dislike the writing style of every single chapter of being in letter format. Your just stuck reading a letter the whole time. Movie is probably better
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Season 3 is no disappointment and full of surprises. Keeps ones interest and extremely well acted. Can't wait for season 4.
B00A757EFW|4.0|haven't used it yet but I'm sure it will be a great game.  Use to play this game all the time as a youngster and it will bring back memories.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I plan to teach this to my 7 and 6 year old.<br />Fortunately, there is a PC demo, which I downloaded<br />which will help me to learn the game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Simple easy to use and does its job. Has lots of different options as far as multiple alarms, sounds, sounds, snooze.  Like that it has a few tones that are a gentle wake up rather than a heart pounding awakening
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This period series is like a great book. Once you start it you will want to keep viewing. The characters are well  defined and the look we get into their lives is uncanny. I can't decide which character I enjoy most, but the widow dowager comes close.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|great service,great movie,very prompt.i was very pleased with the turn around after the cash changed hands. i would mos def buy again
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good read. The ending felt to abrupt for me though hence 3 stars. Other than that it was a good book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Fabulous easy reading. It was a great escape and I was always looking forward to getting into bed at night to read. I read the book pretty quickly. Not the book for you if you like deep took s thought. Just a light read
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a great story, on every level, in every way!  Hope for humanity if such as Ender exist amongst us.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Just another great CD from the Black Keys.  Although not as heavy bluesey like their earlier albums (actually a little more poppy and accessible to the mainstream), it's still a great listen and good for running to.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so I was thrilled when this program came out.  I enjoy the modern spin.
0345803507|5.0|Enjoyable reading- It only took me one week to read all three novels,  Recommended to ladies who are open minded.
B00821OX98|5.0|I read some of the other reviews and boy did some people get it wrong!  This program was WONDERFUL!!!  I found it so thoroughly exciting that I had trouble turning it off to go to bed.........I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400069807|5.0|Such an in depth look at the TRUTH about the food industry! A must-read for anyone concerned about their health along with anyone they care about!!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  Will Smith's comedic timing and easy going approach to his is a[ways entertaining.  I  was especially blown away by Josh Brolin's performance.  His mannerisms and likeness to Tommy Lee Jones are uncanny.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I'll keep it short. I was very impressed. I've been a fan for decades. I've seen & heard the great stuff & the lesser performances. This is a stand out performance. Jason Bonham brought forth his dad's drum work with power and took it beyond in a way that strongly adds to the legend of the family name. John Paul Jones put his name on the map of legends in an even stronger way than it ever was (if that is possible!). He's much more front and center than I've ever seen him too. Robert Plant found a place of power and style to add new life into the songs, while still holding the legendary core of what made him who he is to the world. Jimmy Page is Jimmy Page! No one has the touch and feel upon the strings of a guitar in that same way. Often immitated. Never duplicated. The versions are shorter than in the old days, espcially the guitar solos and jams, probably because those were developed over long tours, which they just don't do now. This version of Ramble On just pounds you in the choruses. Awesome. In my time of Dying is just Zep at their absolute best. No Quarter & Kashmir were also high points. A fine example of what Led Zeppelin is all about.
B004XZR63M|1.0|This book was largely disappointing to me. I bought it because it was a bestseller and so many people have given it a high rating. The book was confusing, especially in the beginning, and can be summarized as follows: quit your corporate job, go to all seminars you see advertised, start investing in real estate, etc. All of that may have worked well for the author but cannot work for all of us.
1609611543|5.0|Everyone should read this book because food just isn't what it used to be. There are so many issues that stem from diet and the gut it is unreal!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|what more can I say? Great. More sounds would be grand and looking forward to new ones.  In the meantime, I lovr it.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|My title says it all, but at the same time I expected something different. First, the mix is muffled and I expected them so sound as clear and open as on the Crossroads DVD performances (which had some line up variations). Oteal's bass needs to be clearer. That's the first thing that stood out to me. From there, keep going. I hear too much of the room and definition throughout the band is lost. The second thing is that I think the band is at its best on upbeat material and they often bring things down for extended periods of time. I want to hear jamming, slide and other solos. I want to hear that soulful drive and freedom that is so present in the Crossroads performances.<br /><br />Now, the great stuff. I just can't say enough about the talent present here and the passion that these people are able to bring up from their individual places. Susan's voice is amazing. No one plays slide like that! Each piece of the band is so relevant. It's impressive.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I chose this rating because it arrived quickly, was in perfect condition as expected,and the game is very challenging. I purchased this for my 12 year old nephew and he loves the challenge. It really makes you have to think and plan carefully and strategically!
1401923127|5.0|This book is very well written! It provides a different approach to how we work than what most people are used to! Great read!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|This series is set in an imaginary world but it touches on real world behavior both pass and present and it pulls no punches with the gritty reality of life.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Great Show. I can't stop watching and I am so glad that there are so many more seasons. I am a little sad about what happened to Ford near the end.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Works good and if you do not play often, then it is fine.  But, you do still have the ads
034553154X|5.0|Nice and interesting. Arrived on time. Reasonably priced.<br />I gave this calendar as a present and my nephew liked it very much.
0792164903|5.0|Nothing beats a good old classic movei with some good acting and great one punch lines. Over all i am very happy with what i got
0345803507|4.0|All kinky sex aside, which is fine by me, but this trilogy is so similar to Twilight even some of it is a carbon copy. I appreciate reading something in my age bracket, I just would've liked it to be more original. Most women will appreciate the falling in love with a \\"bad boy\\", and the detailed sexual escapades are awesome. So read, and read over again. But it doesn't take more than ten pages to start invisioning sexy sparkly vampires.

B008220DGE|1.0|Lousy.  Extremely distasteful movie.  Made little sense and used nudity excessively and unnecessarily for what end?  Acting by Hoffman good.  Didn't like other characters much.
0780622650|5.0|Yeah nothing but good things to say about this movie love it watch it over and over, was a great find on here for a great price
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|Solid Funk, a new side of playing by Joe!<br />The first listen left me wondering what was going on. The second listen, I joined the GROOVE!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Enjoyed the movie in the 70s, and glad to see it again. Sound and video were good given that the movie is from the 70s.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Affleck at his best both as producer/director and actor.  Liked role by Canadian Ambassador.  Story developed well with many tensioned filled moments and just in time solutions.  First rate drama based on true life story.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This movie has it all extremely funny and can be watched over and over as i do each week on thursdays my &#34;Tropic Thunder Thursdays&#34; love this movie
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I decided to buy it after had listened to only one song in the youtube... The CD is brilliant! The songs have nice tunes and lyrics. And the entire album is like that. I loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Every now and then I need a calculator and this one fits the bill well as it's intuitive to use and easy to read.
B007SGM084|5.0|WHAT AN AMAZING LOVE STORY. I. WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE CHARACTERS AND HOW THEY DEVELOPED INTO AN AMAZING STORY OF LOVE HONOR AND LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER.
6305428042|5.0|Found this movie on here and my wife was always talkign about how she loves this movie, glad i came on here for it cant find it in stores

B008K8VDPU|1.0|an update  came out an i lost everything i got diamond  version  and is gone im so mad the need to fix this!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I have a very open mind about NDEs, but I don't see where this book provides the &#34;proof.&#34; I thought it was way too easy to get mired down in the medical detail of what happened to him. In my perspective, that portion of the book over-shadowed any message he may have been trying to relay. With that said, I didn't feel that he explained his NDE so that it would be meaningful to others. As other readers have noted...what information did he learn...what did God have to say other than &#34;love&#34; and &#34;do not fear&#34;?<br /><br />I am very happy for Dr. Alexander and his family that he recovered from his illness, but I walk away from this book with an emptiness. I felt that the book was written to his medical peers and not so much the lay person who would be interested in his experience in &#34;Heaven.&#34; As for me, I found the  concept of the earthworm view to be very depressing, not at all how I pictured life after death in God's kingdom.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A trip through time. Thought provoking read and a reminder of the evils that exist in human nature.  A book for any book lover.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|You cannot go wrong buying this bag for your first DSLR camera. It's got tons of pockets, removable inside velcro straps that help secure your camera and pockets galore. The inside easily accommodates my Pentax K-5 DSLR WITH the lens hood attached.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Libby was a young girl when she ran out of her house and contracted frost bite in toes and fingers as she hid during the murders of her sisters and mother.  Living for 20+ years believing her brother committed the murders, she finds herself being confronted with her past and examining a fear that has always haunted her, was her testimony against her brother the truth? Is her brother spending life in jail because she didn't really see and hear what she said?<br /><br />I choose to read this book after reading \\"Gone Girl\\" which I thought was wonderful.  Gillian Flinn has an extraordinary talent for  twists and turns that keep the reader guessing.  There were times I couldn't put this book down, but there were also times I had to put the book down due to how depressing and dark it became. The pain so many of the characters lived with became almost too real for me.  I hurt to know that these people had lived with lies and  judgements for so long and had problems that were much deeper than the pains of loss and loneliness.<br /><br />I praise Flinn's ability to get the reader so involved with the characters, and to keep the reader involved. Even though \\"Gone Girl\\" did not have a happy ever after ending, it was intriguing. \\"Dark Places\\" takes you so far into the psych of the characters that even though some questions are resolved, you know the characters will never rise from the dark.
859037985X|5.0|Great book with a lot of good examples. You'll learn everything about Lua! The book explain all features of Lua and my favorite part is the C API for extending your application. I recommend it for anyone intersted in the language.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Boy was I ever slammed ,slammed with emotions,crying,laughing,sadness,and swooning and happiness.  I love this book  Colleen Hoover is an artist with . Pen and paper I recommend this book to you
0060254920|4.0|It is a darker story than I remember. I bought it for my children as I loved it when I was a child, but at 4yo and 2yo it will be a few years before they are ready for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I . Liked this book a lot. I highly recommend it. I had a great time reading this book and it definitely was a cliff hanger at the end. I hope y'all enjoy it like I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, but I wish the diamonds were easier to get... but its a fun game :) FUN!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game slot . I wonder how much money it would total out to .<br />I also enjoy prize claw.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|It was exciting! Even though I knew the movie could be paused at any time, I couldn't walk away from it!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|My daughter and I are playing this on our kindle fire. Loads well, responds well and is a lot of fun to unravel the mystery. Spot on for challenges for us.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game! I am playing it on the Fire. A lot of hidden object games are hard to see. All the objects in this game are bright enough and big enough to find. I also like how the game developers have provided measurements of success in the puzzles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The most amazing game ever I love this game...this game is my life.I love the game.I play it every day.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|I'm complex, you're complex, we are complex. Higgs it's simple. Difficult was to explain it. Carroll did it. Great reading
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As always, he comes through with detail and historical data that intertwines with a story that hits close to all US citizens these days.  It took awhile for the action but the plot had to be properly set for the reader.  Do read!!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved this program. Better late then never as they say. Wish it was still on the air. Love the interaction between communities.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Abused wife of police officer (Erin/Katie) plans & executes escape from abusive husband. Meets Alex and children. Starts New life, chased down by husband who plans to kill her &  new found love's, plan backfires, he dies instead. Saw movie today, recommend reading book first for some background info before seeing movie, it makes more sense that way.
B004APVI1G|5.0|This is regarding the 3D in this movie, I have the Blue Ray version already.  I sent the my version of DVD to my grandson, I had that one already.  DVD is not included in this set.  The 3D is really good in this movie, enhances the experience even better than some other remake 3D movies released (this being released in 3D for Theaters).  The owls flying is terrific, and the water beautiful.  The story of the movie is very good also, I have already seen it, but watched it again in the 3D with as much if not more enjoyment.  Beautifully made movie with great animation.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|SW is an artist that is totally committed to his solitary mission. All of his solo releases in my opinion  are interconnected creating a wonderful sonic canvas. Great job on this one Steven and keep bringing memorable music!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has really been a blessing. #'s are big &amp; easy to hit.  especially like that it has a running total at the bottom.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|This is a story of true love, the joy, the heart break, grief, forgiveness, the gift of ever lasting hope for those who need and deserve another chance at life no matter the cost for the donor. A must read for a romantic at heart.
B006WWTKQ0|5.0|This is about the 3D only.  I have the movie in blue ray already.  I like having the 3D version, it just enhances the already beautiful effects of the movie.  Their are not allot of pop outs in the movie, but that can be a good thing.  I find that too many can give you headaches.  The picture quality is so much nicer in 3D, even with the great animation that looks 3D in quality.  Worth adding to my library of movies.  The story was really cute and Brad Pit as the Krill was really cute.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Although with my camera I don't use flash much I decided to buy the SB-700 for the little times that I do use it indoors. I am new to the DSLR world but after a little research I went with this.<br />It has no doubt met my expectations. It lights up my subjects beautifully. I am still learning the ins and outs of it because I'm a newbie. So far it is a great addition to the start of my arsenal.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I choose this book after reading what it was about. I thought that it would be a good read, it didn't disappoint me.<br />A very compasionate book.
B000AXWV40|5.0|Maggot Brain remastered and with 3 bonus songs.This cd is worth any cost.All I can say is WOW WOW WOW. Early 70's rock n roll n funk, at its best.This cd along with Funkadelic and Free Your Mind is all you need.........support your favorite artists
0345803485|1.0|This author is laughing all the way to the bank. I could not finish this awful book. The story is unbelievable and the writing is an insult to true authors out there.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I liked it a lot.<br />Safe for the entire family.<br />Emotional in certain places.<br />Good, clean, family entertainment.<br />Two thumbs up!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Since I started playing this game I have been very entertained by the multiple levels. I have a problem when it comes to putting this game down and going to bed. So enjoy!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Well, it's not perfect, but beats the current versions of Docs To Go and QuickOffice, in my experience. Overall I'm satisfied with this software suite.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have read all of the Lee Child (Jack Reacher) novels and enjoy them very much.  I paid to read this one but i now can borrow books.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|It came within a couple of days, way ahead of projected schedule and I wish that I would have ordered 2 of them!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love the movie and this 3D version is good. Great in some scene to add the the comic book feel.
B00340ESIS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not only is the information relevant and clear, the writing and approach have a nice sense of fun and playfulness that hit the right buttons for me.<br /><br />I had several 'ah ha' moments that crystallized things I'd seen, read, and noticed about movies and even what's worked in my own writing. While I am focusing more on novels than on screenplays, many of these points will serve me well in those endeavors. But I *will* have a chance to try out these ideas and techniques as I work with a videographer friend to put together the screenplay for an upcoming short film.<br /><br />While I do disagree with the author on some of the films he shows as NOT working, I totally understand why he highlighted them and I get his points as something to watch out for in my own writing.<br /><br />Highly recommended. This is not the \\"same old\\" approach that every other book offers.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I was really loving this game... had all the charecters then the game reset itself.  Very frusterating.  And support website is not working
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is addicting very fun and is not easy to put down my girls even help with the hands
B00AA7O22U|3.0|A decent mindless action flick. When Jean Claude is one of the best actors in your line-up,  don't expect an oscar nomination...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me so sad, but it will be one of my favorite books now. I originally bought the ebook but I am going to buy it in paperback so it can sit on my shelf and mean that much more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Make it a movie! I couldn't stop reading! I recommend to all readers. Perfect beach read! Definitely five stars! Good job!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I especially appreciated this author's perspective and ability to humble himself and recognize some truths about these experiences.  Loved this book!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|long game play. Not difficult but challenging enough to keep you engaged in the game while having a fun, relaxing time. Beautiful graphics.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book!! But I actually watched the movie first then decided to read the book, and honestly, I liked the movie better for once!! I was hoping for more descriptive details in the book but found sort of just random, unimportant ones. However, I still enjoyed reading the book and have a special place in my heart for Charlie...I always want to reach out and hold kids like him that just have so much pain and am so glad he found special people (wallflowers!) in his life to do that for him. I do wish more of the moments between him and his sister or him and his mom had made it into the movie, and that great scene when Bill tells him he's \\"special\\". I'm really interested in reading \\"The Fountainhead\\" now though.....
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is a GREAT James Bond, however, most of the situations he gets into have &#34;gaps&#34; and require you to have a good imagination to understand how he survives!
B00B8PMWJI|1.0|COULD NOT MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST 35 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. I GAVE IT ONE STAR B/C I COULDN'T LEAVE THE COLUMN BLANK LIKE I WANTED TO. I SINCERELY TRIED TO MUSCLE DOWN THIS AWFUL EXCUSE FOR A FILM BUT THE GAG REFLEX KICKED IN. I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN JUMPED ON BY SOMEONE WEARING BASEBALL CLEATS THAN TO WATCH THIS LOADED DIAPER OF A MOVIE AGAIN. IT'S LIKE A HORRIBLE VERSION OF 1000 WAYS TO DIE EXCEPT WITH NO STORY BUILD UP, NO GOOD ACTING, AND THE ABSCENSE OF ANYTHING VAGUELY ENTERTAINING.... THIS MOVIE KILLED ITSELF.. UGH BARF. GOOD IDEA+BAD EXECUTION.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Loads super fast so you can check in on your pals or see if any of your pals have made comments on what you posted.
0375423877|5.0|The story was interesting, wholesome and funny.  I'm reading the entire series now and can't wait to get to the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fun and addictive. I could play this game forever. I love the world tour. That is what makes it so addictive.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Use it on my kindle fire when I'm at the doc's or somewhere that's I'm waiting for. Waiting time doesn't seem so long using this app.
B00913DPW2|2.0|You've Got To Be Kidding . I'm sorry but I need some sort of guide lines. They have absolutely no instructions on the games or any hints on what to do so unless you are a gamer who likes to guess everything then don't buy this game. I hate games with no instructions. It takes the fun out of playing when you have no clue on what you're doing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's good; I cant stop playing and I should be asleep because work tomorrow lol and now I am going back to the game.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Great New Alternative Music from Canada. I've liked these women since they came out with their first CD a couple of years ago.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Trip advisor is a great way to check on your trip prior to spending all that money. Learn what's good<br />and what's better. I've posted a lot from my trip and have been told my suggestion help the people ;-)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Like it a lot.kids love it too. It is fun to play with everyone. Thanks, we enjoy it! My four year old is the one who called.it awesome!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have at least half a dozen keyboards, but with the addition of \\"flow\\" this is now the only keyboard you'll ever need. Type, swipe or predict - it's the best. I will admit that \\"flow\\" is not always reliable, but it will improve with time just a the app as a whole has.
B00BESM14U|2.0|The teen angst movie has been done many, many times- and done better. The kids have problems. They're confused. Life is so EMOTIONAL. I get it. I've gotten it many times in the past, and it was done in way more entertaining ways. Probably great for tweens watching a movie like this for the first time.....personally, I was underwhelmed.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I've been a Josh Groban fan for years, so of course I pre-ordered his new album. I ended up watching a video he posted listing all of the tracks and a little bit about each one, and I was impressed that he wrote a lot of the music. everything he touches is gold and the album is lovely, but I do wish he had done maybe one or two more classical pieces. whatever he does, though, I'll always be a fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|when I got the game I could not stop playing it. it is so much fun. I love it so much
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Just love it, another English series to enjoy<br />Do not have anything else to say but need 12 more words, stupid way of evaluating products
B00BHMF578|5.0|This was truly an amazing dramatization of an event in US history that many lived through & remember vividly. I love how this movie took actual pictures of the Iranian hostage crisis and re-created those images EXACTLY as they were in real life. The attention to detail was fantastic and the way the movie truly pulls you into the anxiety and strain and terror the hostages must have felt during that time really impacts you emotionally as you watch it. In addition, I really liked the intro, which outlines the events which led up to the hostage situation-- you understand the motivation behind the event and, most importantly, you understand how the US's desire for oil pitched an entire country into an age of oppression & terror. You fully understand why things unfolded the way they did, but you still feel sorry for the individuals who get caught in the cross-fire....on both sides.
B006RXQ27O|1.0|I am not very happy about the instant video version not being available. I run into movies like this all the time. If you are going to have it listed as being an instant video, it might help actually having it availabe
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a very interesting game I recommend it to anyone who loves to tend horses it is pretty
1401938906|5.0|Gold. 6 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />You know those movies, or concerts, that are just so fab that time disappears and it seems like they only last for ten minutes and you just wish they would never stop?<br /><br />Well this was the book version of that. If I have one criticism it's that it is not long enough.<br /><br />The book?<br /><br />'E-squared: Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments that Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality'<br /><br />The author?<br /><br />Pam Grout: [...]<br /><br />What's it about?<br /><br />In a nutshell.....the law of attraction baby! And yes, I KNOW we have heard so much about this recently, and there are SO many books on the topic that all started to get popular due to that infamous little title The Secret. But if the law of attraction is such an easy concept to master, wouldn't we would all be manifesting millions and have lives of our dreams? well I don't know about you, but for the majority of people, this just isn't happening.<br /><br />Why not?<br /><br />Well, for a start, it's because deep down inside, we really don't believe that it's possible. And this disbelief is preventing what we say we want from forming a place in reality. We put out messages that we want, say, a pony, but then at the same time we are thinking that it's probably not going to happen. And thus the net result is NOTHING.<br /><br />Pam Grout takes this disbelief and helps you shove it to the side for enough time to show you that the law of attraction works. Like, seriously. And in a pretty neat way too. She has a way of taking complicated concepts and explaining them in a humorous, totally easy to understand manner.  Works for me, especially with the attention-span of a child with ADD...<br /><br />The key to the success of this book are that there are actual real-life experiments to do, to not only get some of the stuff you really want, but to prove to YOURSELF that this whole thoughts becoming reality stuff works. Of course, I was skeptical to startwith... I always thought that this stuff only happened sometimes, and more for other people (you know, the rich, successful ones featured in The Secret) than for me.<br /><br />But. Enter experiment number One: The Dude Abides Principle. Basically here - after Pam has not only convinced you to give it a try but really really got you wanting to very very badly - you ask the energy force for a blessing, just to let you know it is actually there. Yes I got one! Of course I did....<br /><br />Well, you say, this could just be coincidence. But time after time, experiment after experiment, she pulled me in and the energy force delivered. I got ACTUAL REAL-LIFE things that I asked for.<br /><br />If you have any inclination toward this at all, or if you are a massive skeptic, or if you just want to laugh out loud,... I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />And uh - be careful what you wish for!!<br /><br />FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for this review. The opinion in this review is unbiased and reflects my honest judgment of the product.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hard to put this book down once started! So many emotions come into play while reading! Love. Trust. Faith. Hope. Strength. Courage.
B008N9AASC|4.0|Not as good as Baraka, but still a powerful and provocative piece. Fricke's camera work is, of course, first rate. This film is vastly superior to most of the excrement leaking out of Hollywood these days--essential viewing. Buy it, watch it, share it with your loved ones!
B000ZP8174|5.0|As a chef that has broken both feet in an accident unrelated to my profession I can't waer conventional shoes/clogs. Crocs works good for me, especially when they developed non-skid Crocs. I have used Crocs for approximately ten years; I tried all of the others and Crocs are the only ones that work for me. I wear out 2-3 pairs a year. About the price for a single pair of quality leather clogs, which I only use for professional competitions.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is the best movie overall I have seen in years. The fact that it is based on a true story makes the intensity and suspense of the movie that much more real. The screenplay was genius and witty. The acting impeccable. And all with relatively minimal cursing and no vulgarity. Worth every bit of the 5 stars!!
B00127RAJY|2.0|Twas the Jillian Michaels workout disc #2 that killed my back.  It hurt last week after I did it, but this time it has killed it dead.  A massage would be ever so nice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very very good and it has a lot of action and romantic love.<br />I like the book you should read it.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love that it has many puzzles some hard some easy. it is hours of entertainment for a low price. it has many colorful pictures and it challanges you with speed rounds.<br /><br />-
0345803485|5.0|I love to read. Never have read an erotic book but these ones are the best. I love them! But my favorite is Part 2.
1439153663|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and never let me go.  I had to force myself to put it down to go to bed.  Loved it.  If you are looking for a feel-good, uplifting read...this is not it.  It's shocking and quite torturous at times, but each pages leaves you begging for more.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Kind of predictable but that's what I wanted.  Nothing to write home about but it's a good way to spend the evening.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I read anything this author writes because she makes me care about the characters.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for the footnotes.  The author has written instructions at the beginning of the Kindle book on how to access the footnotes and I did this for the first ten.  After that, I just skipped them because I didn't think they added anything to the book.  The footnotes looked to me like a compromise between the author and editor (the editor thinking the book was better without the text and the author wanting to retain it.)  I would recommend the book.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|I used them to be 24 hours walking in the hospital and they are amazing. My foots didn't hurt. I totally love them.
1451695195|5.0|WELL WORTH YOUR TIME. YOU WILL SHARE THIS WITH MANY OTHERS. THE ONE PERSON THAT PROFESSIONALLY KNOWS HOW A BRAIN WORKS SHARES WHAT HAPPED TO HIM WHEN HE WAS &#34;DEAD&#34;. IT'S INTERESDTING TO EXPERIENCE HIS SURPRISE TO THIS EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HE CONCLUDES HAPPENED.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was told that I would want to throw it at a wall, and I did, but I would break my kindle. I cried. Real.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very addictive. Had just the right amount of tragic pull and blissful resolutions. I loved it!
0345803493|5.0|I love to read. Never have read an erotic book but these ones are the best. I love them! But my favorite is Part 2.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I have had this app 7 months and just now deloped problems updating, so I contacted Customer Service.  &quot;Kat&quot; responded and said they couldn't reproduce the problem.  No sugestions.  No concern.<br /><br />Uninstalled.  Wasted THIS relationship!
B001NS7J02|5.0|Very solid album by the band.  This was their third release which saw the band move into more of a gothic sound (as it has been described before).  Album has some long, intricate songs which keeps the album interesting and mixes up the song structures.  All the songs are about love (as Peter Steele has said of ALL Type O Negative material).  Highly recommend album.
B007Z5LBE2|5.0|There is nothing more you love they love, this movie was very healing as it brought back all the feelings, the boarding of the plane as you watched your baby daughter weep not knowing if you would ever see her again. Your wife trying to be strong with the look of dread. The long lost love that hardened you into a warrior... The cosmic return which you will look upon only as a gift given to you by God. I cannot say enough how true this film is.
0345803507|5.0|I love to read. Never have read an erotic book but these ones are the best. I love them! But my favorite is Part 2.
B00065MDRW|5.0|PThere are very few albums i call masterpieces but i have to call this one that,if anyone new is into weird rock classics start with this,the opening track is the best gem in the album bunch,the influences of jazz fushion,art rock,progressive rock are in here ,its just a must have
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing seemed very sophomoric to me.  I ended up not caring about either character due to the poor writing.  Won't continue with this series.
0375842209|3.0|I read this book a few years ago, and last night on a flight home i read it again. i had no idea how i understood what was going on! The book is narrated weird, by like a ghost or something and the author gets so caught up in imagery and details, that the book had a very small story line. I would have liked the book SO MUCH better if Lisel herself narrated it! Things happen too quickly in the book, Zusak makes way too many annoying historical errors. My family is from Germany, and i know for a fact that if a little girl was at a book burning she would be jailed, people generally wouldnt watch the burnings, guards made people stand 5 ft away from the fire, and the books Lisel did steal would be very deep, political book that she would not enjoy.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Simple, clean interface.  Lots of customizability.  Been hoping I could find a good, free sudoku to replace the one I lost when I updated my Nook Tab from stock OS.  Worth the full price - grab it fast while it's free.  And tell your friends!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator plus free is wonderful.The numbers are bold and big.Scientific calculations s are too intense. This is just what I need when I need it. My grandchildren can use it as well.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Great story lines, mid level acting. Overall, very entertaining. Akin to BSG in this respect. If you enjoy SciFi this will satisfy.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's addictive.  l did have some problems with getting the stats to show up but other than that it is great!

B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really like this book and i think it was good<br />Also everyone said they like it is a really good book to they
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|Even though Pierce Brosnan, and Rene' Russo did a good job as the remake, it doesn't have the sophistication and charm as the original movie with Steve McQueen.
0312382464|5.0|The equally brilliant second novel in the trilogy. I found that Simon Montfort's tale was heart breaking. Read all; three books; well worth the cost.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers at sometimes glitches but then it fixes so you know it is a super fun game and it is fun to play in a boring class like Mr.Clark's fat self class because he never teaches just like Mrs.Tillman
1401941893|5.0|I love this book, it made me feel more positive and helped me relief stress. I feel like I can now acheive my dreams with this inspiring dream! :) Love it!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Very Easy to Use.  Makes great digital images of slides.  Saves directly to SD Card.<br /><br />I was charged with the task of saving my family's slides to digital images.  I purchased this product because you can use it without a computer.  The slide gets inserted into the top, then you push the button and it automatically saves the image to the SD card.  Super easy and the images turned out great.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I love this series....this season was just as exciting as the first one. If you like dark reality with a twist around every corner, this is a must.  One of the best series on TV to date.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is very useful because of its features and what it has to offer. I use it to know how much battery % i have.it also helps me so that i dont overcharge it for very long.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Hey whats not to love,a brand name battery pack,at a great price that I got! I saved at least $6.00 at retail.Plus the batteries work great and have some for the next time I need to change batteries.Thanks for the great buy.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I like the shows a lot, sometimes the story line sticks to the same schtick, and sometimes it surprises you. It's a nice, no brain required, kind of tv show.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|A love story that is repeated every day and the hurt that follows are inescapable.  It is a heart rendering story at best..
1401207529|5.0|One of the best comics I ever read, the cover and everything was very good shipped on time too :D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much and I can't wait to see what the next stop is. Kiloo games made a really awesome game and I am so glad I found this game!!!
B002BGCCZC|4.0|I cannot believe the amount of energy from these guys! Can you hear the sounds of 'Queen' in their music? (Duh!)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I liked this game much more of a challange than some.  I have been playing a while like the diffrent types of games so it is new all the time.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|loved this book, couldn't stop reading it. it's a great choice for AR points also! In love with Nicholas Sparks :)
B0063M22QO|3.0|this is good for a start but i have been playing a while- So i needed something more of a challange
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft the only thing I do not like is that there is no lava and you can not collect redstone. minecraft is awesome.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This FPS is simply impressive, the graphics are exceptional. The user interface takes a while to get used to. The game is a must play.
B003QSEYQY|1.0|You do not support Dolby Digital Plus for movie sound.<br />Netflix does this. Vudu does. Your sound quality is horrible.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. It's big enough where I can see it without my glasses.. It also has all the functions. I give it 5stars. No problems with the app at all on my Kindle Fire.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|You do not support Dolby Digital Plus for movie sound.<br />Netflix does this. Vudu does. Your sound quality is horrible.
B002VWNID6|1.0|Bought this DVD and went to play it like you normally would. Halfway through the film stops and suddenly returns to the DVD menu. Proceeded to search the scene selections and see that the DVD does in fact stop at that point with no subsequent scenes. Very frustrated and annoyed, I eject the disc and try flipping it and playing the other side. The rest of the film is in fact on the other side, but whoever thought it was necessary to split a 2 hour movie without any extra features between two sides of a disc is a total moron.
B005P4PAVK|1.0|You do not support Dolby Digital Plus for movie sound.<br />Netflix does this. Vudu does. Your sound quality is horrible.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I expect the product to be as awesome as the movie.  While I do not have blue-ray or 3D viewing at my house I will most likely get this to keep and have when I upgrade to a home theater system.  The movie was awesome!  I would see it again any time I could because I feel I missed a lot.  I have the Lord Of The Rings collection and watch them at least once a year.  I guess I have Hobbitmania. (My word if you use it you can quote me.)  There are so many good reviews here.  You can add mine to it.<br />I am hoping for a part 2 to the incredible journey!  It will be awesome to have more.
B00899F0G8|1.0|You do not support Dolby Digital Plus for movie sound.<br />Netflix does this. Vudu does. Your sound quality is horrible.
B000068FUS|5.0|This was my third copy.  I keep giving them to friends.  I also own it on vinyl.  fascinating story telling.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. It is incredible!!!! It shows how incredibly strong the human spirit is. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Thank you Colleen Hoover for another spectacular book!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|You do not support Dolby Digital Plus for movie sound.<br />Netflix does this. Vudu does. Your sound quality is horrible.
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|This is a great CD, especially if you are an EWF fan who can listen to their music over and over again!!
B005NFW0U0|1.0|You do not support Dolby Digital Plus for movie sound.<br />Netflix does this. Vudu does. Your sound quality is horrible.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book was amazing. I saw  the movie but now that I have read the book I am in awe. The book really is better.
1416575464|4.0|I cannot believe how bad some of these rooms are. And they were professionally done. Remember that nauseating avocado green from the '70s? Remember it was everywhere, the fridge, the shag carpet... Well I know where it went. Every page of this book features that color prominently. Yuck! And that baby &#34;feces&#34; yellow? That's on every page too. I can't believe models and designers live in those rooms. They look like flop houses on the lower east side. My home is SO much nicer and I'm a nobody.<br /><br />However, there's tons of info in here. I like the way they dissect a room and show you why it works. Of course I dissect them too and can tell you why they don't. Those two hideous colors take over every single space for one. White walls and ceilings look too industrial and cheap. Like an insane asylum. Or a gas station. Hideous. I mean seriously HIDEOUS! Also I'm all for cash (as in casual) but these rooms need a housekeeper, pronto! Way too cluttered and messy, like a furniture store. A used furniture store.<br /><br />Still, for the info and the info alone, I like it. The cover is the prettiest page in the book though, in my brazen opinion. And I now know for sure that avocado green and baby &#34;feces&#34; yellow are most definitely NOT for me. :Q
B003I55BIA|4.0|I feel this book deserves four stars because of its great romance. The way the main characters describe one's  feelings and love for one another is just phenomenal. However, I did not like some of the transitions throughout their the book. It seemed a little rushed. Other than that it was a well written book and keeps you on your toes for what happens next.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth Hart can do anything... she is a force and I've always admired her talent and versatility. This album just proves she has more to offer.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I love this movie! My best friend and I used to watch it all the time when we were younger. Definitely a Cinderella story =)
B00979CS50|5.0|This album has nice long guitar solos, just like in days of yore, Excellent album. I can't stop listening to it.
0525958002|5.0|What a great book! It's so fun to have a look into the life of an icon that has been in my life for so long.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I can't decide between this and Sudoku4ever (by the same company) as the BEST sudoku game out there for Android. If you like Sudoku programs, get it. It has a wonderful interface and tons of useful features.
0307352153|5.0|I was enjoying this book very much and was about halfway through when my daughter, visiting from college, picked it up and wouldn't put it down! So I sent it back to school with her. It is the highest of recommendations when a college student does extracurricular reading. But I look forward to getting it back to finish it myself. The author thoroughly and expertly explores the introverted personality dynamic and its unrecognized value in our culture.
B009LHFYNG|5.0|I got this for my husband who has an earlier version.  He thinks this version has much new information and he is finding it very valuable.  It was also great how we could put it on both his computer and his Ipad.
1600242405|5.0|I had checked this out from the library and found myself loving it. It's read by Johnny Depp as well as another great voice, and Keith Richards pops in to say hello. After renewing at the library at halfway through, I decided I needed to buy it. I wanted to listen from the beginning again anyway. I came away really liking Keith Richards, who knew he was such a nice and honest guy? I was blown away by his songwriting talent. It's a fun long listen with 20 discs.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My kids have watched this movie non stop for the last 3 months, I have thneeds coming out my pores. Still, I like watching with the kids as the moral never I know all the words to all the songs only having listened to the movie while driving and the kids watching.<br /><br /> old.
B005K17RU0|5.0|.Great weather very handy. Use it dailey to plan job site work and projects ,pouring concrete ,laying pipe ,installation of underground utilities
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling Sky was interesting with some surprising twists.  Would recommend for anyone who likes sci-fi.  Probably won't be another season though.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have a Logitech G500. My friend wanted the Anker due to price and he liked the looks of it.<br />After using it for a month now, I can say that it is on par with G500. We didn't do any FPS gaming, so I can't comment on that part. But for Starcraft, Warcraft, DDO and Skyrim it worked perfectly. Nice fit and it moves perfectly on the desk.<br />If you don't want to overpay for a gaming mouse, I suggest you to try this one.
0062060562|1.0|I couldnt get into this book. I think I read about 60 pages before giving up. Not only does the story keep going back and forth, it's kind of boring. What a waste of money!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy and accurate.  I can quickly check the weather on my kindle without having to turn on my computer.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|My husband loves Harry Potter, so we purchased this set. We put in the first DVD, excited to see the film, and we could barely distinguish one word from another, even with the sound turned way up. The words are not crisp and clear as they are in most films. We were so very disappointed! And every one of these is the same...we have a relatively new SONY TV, and we can hear other films perfectly, so we don't think the problem lies on this side.<br /><br />If you are thinking of purchasing this set, be aware that the same thing may happen to you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The kids love this game from 12 year old to our 3 year old they all play it even my husband plays to let them know who's boss in high scores
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Being a student of international relations and a love for Asia, I have always been fascinated by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or North Korea. This book is mainly interviews with North Korean refugees that either fled to China or South Korea. The author outlines, horrible living conditions, a police state, and crippling poverty, save for only the top echelon of North Korean society. Those things I was aware of, what I wasn't aware of was the struggle to find even the most meager of meals, and how life is so cheap. People die of malnutrition on the streets and elementary teachers watch in horror as their students literally die before their eyes, do to lack of sanitary home conditions and the ever present non-existent food. It is a pity a regime so obsessed with building nuclear weapons cannot even feed it's own populace. Given the grim stories, the book is actual a fairly fast read. Highly recommended to anyone curious about &#34;Hermit Kingdom&#34;.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I liked it<br />Funny and cute.  I would recommend this as a family night movie.<br /><br />I like the fact I don't have to worry about returning the movie to a machine, fee's, just download and watch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My tired eyes make no mistakes with this APP! I can handle any equation, especially my checkbook easily, faster and with less squinting and having to wonder, 8 or 3, 6 or 9. I'm loving it!!!<br /><br />Now if only I could get it on my PC at work :)
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I have to say this movie was funny, a little corny at times but it kept my attention and entertained me while it tickled my funny bone.<br /><br />I approve this movie
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|First, let me say that I love all the incarnations of the Voyager headset.  I am currently on my fifth one, a Voyager Pro+, and I would never go back to any other headset.  However, my single complaint about the Voyagers is that they can be fragile.  I lost one after placing in in my shirt pocket, and to this day I'm not sure what I did to cause the neck to fail.<br /><br />That started me looking for a case for my headset, and looking on Amazon brought me to this case.  I now own 4 of them, and even the headset on my desk sits in one when not is use.  I have not lost another Voyager headset since I started using them.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. The case fits the Voyager like a glove, with the long necked microphone fitting behind a piece of leather.<br />2. The headset is easy to slide in and easy to remove, even while driving.<br />3. The magnetic latching cover stays put, but is easy to open.<br /><br />CONS<br />1. The belt clip absolutely sucks, and I no longer even try to use it.  Instead, I bought an extra large keyring which I hook onto the belt clip, and then I use a D ring to keep the whole thing attached to my laptop bag.<br />2. The case is not really rigid, so someone stepping on the case would still probably destroy the headset.  However, with just a little care, the case is plenty strong enough to protect the headset when it is tossed in a pocket or bag.<br /><br />All in all, I consider this to be damned cheap insurance to safeguard my Voyager headset, and I will keep buying these things as long as they keep making them.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It is more of the same but it gives background into will smith's character.<br />The story is good and there is enough action to keep you interested.<br /><br />I would recommend for family night with teens.
B00908DDZM|5.0|refreshingly fun and meaningful hip hop.  in a world of weezy's, drakes, 2 chainz and 'ye, ryan and mack give you 15 tracks of some of the best hip hop you'll find going back a few years.  can be a bit on the poppy side at points but it helps to balance out the rest of this rather eclecticly themed album.  if you only know of same love and thrift shop, you are in for quite the surprise.  while these two tracks provide perfect bookends for the album; thrift shop playing the whimsical mock-the-rap-game role and same love taking a strong stand on one of the biggest social topics of our time, don't think that it ends there.  These two take it where many others are afraid to go, either from lack of courage or fear of lost album sales.  You can't help but shake your ass thanks to ryan and macklemore.  2 minutes later you might be laughing at lyrics or stopping to actually think about them.
1476734941|4.0|it really helped me choosing the right ingredients in order not to be bloated at the end of my meals
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun and super addicting. And after a while, you get bored with it. But the new settings of the subways are cool. (Examples: Rio and New York.)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An awesome game.its perf for when u r bored and just wanna hag fun. I would totes recommend this to everyone of all ages:)
1451695195|5.0|I am on my second time for reading this book.  So far I have given away 3 copies of this book.  I belong to a very poor church and buying a book is frivolous for many people.  I gave one copy to a woman whose daughter had committed suicide.  After reading the book, this woman is going to give a copy to her nephew.<br /><br />Now I know Who God is and where He is.  I am looking forward to getting the second book Eben writes.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Functional and lets you choose days for your alarms, in case you get up at differnt times on different days...you don't have a million alarms, just one set for the same time on different days.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app it lets me know how much battery I have left and it is super simple to understand
B007W1BLN0|5.0|This is a very touching movie but also sad to see such a young person's struggle with life. Definitely a &#34;Food For Thought&#34; movie.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|We loved watching this show so we bought the complete set.  Nice to have and be able to watch whenever we choose.<br />My only complaint is the packaging.  Discs not in individual sleeves or marked by espisode on the disc.  Hard to use on the spindle holders.
B0036UW09U|5.0|I had seen this movie when it was in theaters and was happy to have the opportunity to watch it again. Great music!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We've been enjoying Indiana Jones movies since they started coming out and have moved on with each media type... However, the new Blu-Ray release is brilliant quality and it's great to watch these movies in such detail. Fantastic...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft but I would prefer the Pc version because it has a ton more stuff but it costs 27dollars
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|perchè io amo loro e mi è piaciuto questo nuovo album. Lo adoro e lo sento ogni giorno in continuazione
B004JRVQX0|1.0|I received this product with purchase of Avid MBox Mini and ProTools LE. The iLok worked for 7 days after installation. Then the error messages started everytime I tried to start ProTools. iLok does not provide phone support. So for the next 7 days I traded email with a gracious support representative working through possibilities that would have taken maybe an hour if we had been on the phone or chat. After 7 days I was requested to return the product so they could send me a new one. oh and....that'll cost you $49.95 plus shipping for the administrative cost of moving your licenses.<br /><br />Unless of course you would like to pay: Zero Down Time, (Insurance)$30.00, plus License Recovery with iLok$49.95, plus Courtesy iLok  $0.00 ( they don't charge you for replacing the piece of garbage) AND Expediency Fee of  $100.00 plus Sales Tax:  $4.43  plus Shipping estimate:  $12.05(estimate because if you want it quick you'll pay more...what was the Expediency Fee for?) Subtotal:$196.43<br /><br />What a scam! The technology is ridiculous. The customer service is ridiculous. Why are ProTools and other vendors subjecting their customers to this? My next move is to find a different software vendor if the replacement iLok doesn't work.<br /><br />Nicely played AVID - ProTools - PACE iLok.<br /><br />Yikes!<br /><br />Peace
B0089EHWQE|5.0|That girl was so special!  She thought herself as very little in value, when she was extremely intuitive and resourceful.  She treated Will as a real person, not a quad.  I could see her falling in love with him...but he was right in his decision not to want her to fall in love with him.  I once loved a quad, and I felt her pain.  The romance of the castle made me want to see it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome wonderful fabulous I love it. But I hate that I lost all my achievements when Rome update happened...not happy bout that!!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|A feel good story that is true.  We have watched this over a few times and always enjoy it every time.
B0001I55OC|5.0|Timeline is a fun suspend-belief-and-enjoy-it movie.  It even has a clever twist at the end, which I will not reveal here.  If you like a smart adventure, you'll enjoy this.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Since we are in the cattle industry it was great seeing this story. Temple is an amazing woman and the actress played her well.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|What else is there to say?  This is the collection every ABBA fan really needs. This includes some great tracks I had never heard before -- apparently not on any of the popular album releases.  If you're too young to remember ABBA, then you probably won't understand.
B007712XAU|5.0|Great entertainment for a long weekend during calving time at the ranch.  Loved the characters in this series.  Great ending on the second season.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|2013-03-01
B0055PGUYU|5.0|If you struggle with what you think are constantly the same mistakes then this book will put it into perspective. I can relate to the changing of habits as I've lost 70lbs because of exactly what this book described. Read it so you can find out why you've made good changes in your life or how you can.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|: ) Great book I would highly suggest this as a read. I am very interested to watch the rest of the series unfold.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|this has always been a favorite in our house. we laugh through all of it. it's alot of fun! the characters are great and the kids learn a little something about being a part of a family.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is a timeless classic for me.  Gary Cooper nailed this character.  Black and white but one to watch over and over...
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game needs updates to choose your skin and needs flint and steel and just be like the Xbox edition<br /> Seriously!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|1.0|i was unhappy with Part One, finding the motivations and actions impossible and the characters flat and one-dimensional.<br />Part Two started off nicely rectifying Part One but quickly settled into The Plot Device which wags the tail of this tale.<br />the characters switch and then become cliche and i mentally kept looking at my watch.<br />finally after laboring The Plot Device far too long the book fizzles out to an unsatisfying conclusion.<br />i didn't like any of the nasty characters and found myself sorry for wasting my time.<br />reader beware, it's a book version of a lifetime network movie.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|Great item  My Kindle is secure and easy to carry.  Looks great.  Just what I wanted. Recommend it to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished this book at 2 AM last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It made me happy. It made my sad. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It me proud. It made me empathize. It made me excited. It made me hope. It made me believe in fate and it made me feel true love and forgiveness.<br /><br />Every emotion Sky went through, I went through. The conversation she had with herself was so beautiful and heartbreaking and therapeutic for her.<br /><br />Holder's ability to know exactly what to say and do at the moment that she needs it most is proof positive that what happened in their lives up until the grocery store was meant to happen that exact same way because it made them who they are and brought them together.<br /><br />The memories will keep coming - good and bad. But they, Sky & Holder will get through it together, forever.<br /><br />I will be 39 next week and I got the reading bug when I was 16 with Flowers in the Attic by VC Andrews and I have never, ever read a book that effected me so strongly. It has been almost 12 hours since finishing and I am still crying. Crying because my heart breaks for that little girl and my heart swells for the women that she is and the unconditional love that now envelopes her.<br /><br />***disclaimer*** Although this book's main characters are 17-19 years old, as a mother of a 13 yr old girl, it should not be read by those younger than 18. Anything younger than that, would be way too much emotion for them to handle.
B005C5A6C0|2.0|I've loved the past two albums by Machine Head, and was hoping for either more of the same, or better.  The actual music was decent enough, nothing groundbreaking, but the lyrics and vocals just ruined all other aspects of the album.  He sings a lot more clean vocals on this album, along with cringe inducing self harmonies.  I'm not sure if they knew who their target audience was with this one, or if they were just trying something new.
B008OOYALE|3.0|whenever I try to move a habitat the camera moves me to the ocean and you cant scrull back to your island.  Please update
B003G4W49C|5.0|I got this book as my introduction to &#34;classic&#34; sci-fi.  I've heard a lot of people complain about how unrealistic the children are in this book, but I'd have to disagree.  There are several peices to this that most of those people tend to ignore.  This kids are the top tier, best of the best, so of course they're not going to be like &#34;average&#34; kids.  Next, it's the future and educational programs are vastly different than that of today, and children will act how you raise them to.  If you expect them to be &#34;childish&#34; and encourage it, they will be.  You only have to look at children of other nations to see how vastly the environment can affect them.<br /><br />Getting back to the point, the book is very well written, the characters have clear motivations and personalities.  Though it's not entirely original, it's still a joy to go on this journey.
0064431274|2.0|It seems that the paperback version is a picture book and the hard covered version has the words written. It did not state that anywhere, it took two tries and speaking to an amazon representative to finally understand what was happening. I don't know why anyone would want a book with mo words while they can have the written version. Amazon was great and kind enough to take care of the problem. I appreciate that but the fact that there are two different types of books should be clearly stated.
B00867GHS8|5.0|We really enjoy 3D movies but have been disappointed by many that were orginically 2D and adapted to 3D after the fact and felt we wasted our money buying the 3D version. However, Finding Nemo was worth it. The 3D is nicely done and does add to the movie. That being said, don't expect the same kind of &#34;wow factor&#34; you would have gotten if it were originally intended to be 3D but overall, nicely done.
0307474259|5.0|Obesity is epidemic in the United States in spite of our adherence for the past forty years to a low fat, high carbohydrate diet. Taubes skillfully reports the facts. The medical community and the nutritional community rationalized that the hypothesis that ingesting fat leads to clogged arteries; that the obese are lazy and eat too much; that eating too much protein will also lead to clogged arteries and will harm us in myriad ways; that a calorie is a calorie is a calorie and it doesn't matter what type of food it comes from (except, if it is from fat, it is bad)---all without proof.<br /><br />The take-home lesson is we must pay attention to the role that insulin plays in our bodies. We will all be more healthy if we eat as though we have diabetes.
1616550414|5.0|Love this book. I highly recommend this book to every Zelda fan out there. Very well put together, I learned a lot about the games
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven was &#34;ok&#34; for me.  It's well written and I liked the characters but the ending left me feeling kinda empty.  I think I was expecting to much.
B0000DJZ8R|2.0|I didn't think the story followed the book very well.  It concentrated on Tom and Ma Joad and most of the other<br />characters were either not well acted or nearly non-existent.  The preacher acted as though he was mentally<br />deficient.  I much prefer the play and the book!
B005PK56TA|4.0|This series is creepy and even disturbing at times but also very entertaining. Different from any other television show that I've ever seen. If you like twists and turns...this one's for you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is very much like the bridges game.  I really liked it wished it lasted longer.  It is relaxing but makes you think.
B0040I09RM|5.0|My husband wanted to watch this show but I wasn't sure I'd like a show about a motor cycle gang. Well I was pleasantly surprised...And hooked after the first episode. By the end of the season you'll feel like you really know and care about the characters.<br />Great show. I recommend you give it a shot.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Just a great relaxing mindless activity.  I've played other angry bird games and found this one a bit harder but still fun.
0425263916|5.0|This series had me captured.  It's erotica with class.  Too long of a wait for the third installment to the series.
B007N9FKCY|2.0|I didn't like this game very much  because it seemed difficult to control the movement of the character.But the graphics are cute.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|This was great read.  One of Stephen King`s WELL WRITTEN stories.  I recommend this book as a really good read.  It proved to be a page turner for me.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I like the idea of this game alot but there is little instruction or direction on what you need to do.  There is no place to get help when you can't determine the next place or challenge to undertake.  So, you reach a point you just can't play anymore due to lack of information.  If there were better directions it would be really fun.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Very pleased with the whole series.. the characters just keep getting better, even the ones you love to hate. Can't wait for the next one, although I know I'll have to...
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is awesome.  Its a great place for sharing all kinds of things. The only problem is there is so many tihngs to look at to pique your interest you might get nothing else done!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I enjoy listening to this while I'm driving .It fits the Tempo of Miami's traffic, it seems to keep my dogs on alert as well.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen!  She is so funny so this book was an uplifting easy read.Sure to make you laugh a lot.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|A brilliant game with so much to do. I'd recommend it to everyone. It does get a bit glitchy now and then but still pretty perfect
B0086700CM|2.0|For me, I did not like this game very well.  I felt it was difficult to control the character at a high speed.  Because of this I really haven't played it.
B003VOP7J6|5.0|This albums sounds a lot warmer than I remember it, probably because of the format.  Sounds like California, for sure dude!
B003B02PEU|4.0|Good read i dont read much grisham but i enjoyed this novel if you are a fan of grisham im sure ull like it
B000VXJYFI|5.0|There's no accounting for taste.  Even Jimi apparently churned this out just to escape a contract?  I'll be damned, though, I like this album better than any of the Experience stuff.  Not sure why, it just sounds more raw to my ears, with some serious groove going on.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game!  And now it is even more fun since I found I can play it on my Kindle Fire!
B0001AP158|5.0|At first I didn't like it, but as I played it over and over, it gave me a different outlook on the lyrics.  Amazing how Bon Jovi can go from rock to soothing music.  What talent!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This one's addicting! This fantastic game by SuperSolid is absolutely amazing. It is almost exactly like the Temple Run series, but with a cool twist.<br />It has the same functions:<br />-tilting your device to turn<br />-tapping to jump<br /><br />But it also has a variety of new opportunities:<br />-you are able to earn new characters (&quot;runners&quot;) as you advance and collect fish instead of coins.<br />-you play out as a penguin, but as said above, you can switch to different penguin types...<br />-better graphics than the Temple Run series, this is only what I believe!<br />-the penguin are MUCH cuter than the random guy you play as in Temple Run..<br /><br />You can read other 4 to five star reviews for more information about this five star game, I discourage the reading of the other 1-3 star ratings because there is most likely something wrong with their device, or something wrong with them themselves... Sorry for the low-raters!<br />SUPER PENGUINS IS THE FUNNEST* GAME IN THE WORLD, even though I probably say that with every new game I get, BUT IT'S FREE AND TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Get this app people!!<br />******by the way,  know &quot;funnest&quot; isn't a word, but you know what it means and its the best way to describe this game!
B00271HAK8|4.0|You've got to love Ferris Bueller ,and root for he and his friends to score a successful day off (  or to get away with his 10th unexcused absence !! ) He's almost got everyone fooled ! ALMOST !
B003O86FMW|5.0|As the first book, The Hunger Games.  Surprising twists.  Kept my attention.  Can't wait to read the last book in the series.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Well ,actually the grand children made me get this wildly popular and highly addictive Angry Bird app. I just hate those Smart - Aleck piggies . Kids had me playing with some success almost ,fairly ,nearly right away !!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book from beginning to end! There were parts that made me laugh,get teary eyed and I never wanted to put the book down! I read it in one day.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I Loved it and I am not a huge Once Upon a Time Fan. However, I just love Michael Raymond James and he was absolutely fascinating!  Yet, I do not want to downplay the other cast members and the story lines.  This episode would almost make me want to watch more.  Now if they definitely want me to watch religiously, Michael needs to be in every episode.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED EVER THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS GAME, HEY THE NEXT UPDATE, CAN YOU MAKE IT IN TOKYO JAPAN??? I WOULD PLAY THIS FOREVER IF IT WAS IN TOKYO JAPAN. PLEASE MAKE IT TOKYO JAPAN!!!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good thriller but not my favorite Baldacci book. I will look for more of his to read though. When is the next new book coming out?
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game.The first time I played it I didn't want to put it down. Great game for adults and wonderful for kids
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|This game is awesome and the graphic style reminds me of DOOM but the gameplay is amazing and I hope more games will come that are like this one.
1616550414|5.0|I love this book. The amount of details and secret things Aonuma and Miyamoto never talked about before is incredible! I really recommand it for any Zelda fan. The only problem (minor) I got with the book it self is the cover. The corners of the book were &#34;ruined&#34; by the delivery.
B001O3B2M2|5.0|This is some of her best work, just love the variety and the powerful lyrics in these songs.  Would definitely recommend it.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is great! Fast paced but still well developed character arc that makes you care about what happens as the two Judges go though hell<br />Looks super sharp on Blu Ray too, which helps with all the beautiful slow motion sequences
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Taken was good from the first scene & never lost momentum. Liam truly excelled in this role as a dedicated & protective dad. Taken was non-stop action. I highly recommend this movie.
B00280LYHS|4.0|Well it was pretty good. It was amazing, really. It just wasn't that special or anything. I liked the battle scene a lot though.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It is very fun but it just erased all my work! I just deleted it. I reccomened to all if you get it now.
B00908DDZM|1.0|This is explict! Buyer beware! Bought this supposedly clean version to be heard by tweens & it is not \\"clean\\"! Amazon not has another version listed, not available when I made my purchase. To be clear this review is NOT about content, it is about it not be label EXPLICIT! It still is not labeled as EXPLICIT.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it, my sister recommended it to me and i was dreading it at first but then i loved it
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book.  A little technical, but Dr. Davis explains everything well.  The information about wheat is amazing (and scary) but fits right in with everything I have observed in my own experience.  The book explains a lot of things that I had experienced but did not know why.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|its a good game.I like all the befrent fighters. but it is vary hard to ster. that macse its  hard to het the target.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Definitely a must have for anyone looking for a few hours of wasted time. Kind of like Paradise Island. Option to purchase diamonds.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Just received this in the mail today. Currently one of my favorites in my collection, right up there with flash thompson venom, and days of future past wolverine. unlike those two figures which are fairly pre-posed, deadpool is quite heavily articulated, yes hes missing the abcrunch (which frankly is pointless on most figures) and some flexibility on arm postioning (makes holding the assault rifle in any natural way near impossible). but never the less he can be contorted into quite a few cool poses. Also one hell of a paintjob on this figure. To sum up diamond select knocked it out of the park again, i was lucky enough to find this below retail on amazon thru a third party but honestly would have paid twice retail for the quality of product (especially when compared to other highly overpriced deadpool figures, im looking at you marvel legends)
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Very educational and entertaining. This book was a delightful read and changed my thinking about meal preparation as well as team leadership as a whole. Fun for anyone!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book It is a great read. I kept picking it up to read so i could see how it turned out .
B0094K1MH2|5.0|this movie was very well written and looked great. It took me a couple of times to watch it because it seems a little long. I still liked the movie though.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The game came along way from the original<br />Recommend this game to everyone fun for whole family and anyone else you know
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Forget about reality, this is an explosive title about the board game Battleship.  I found it very cool and loved.  You will read tons of reviews talking about how it sucked because the aliens invade the ocean and not the city.  Why they started a war with the Navy... and stuff like that... Hey, this is not a documentary, this is a movie!!! design to entertain.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because u are running away from the po po and how it updates so  u are in rio or new york
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I use this app got when my neighbors are a little to loud and my mornings a little too early.  Also great for when I want to hear the sounds of the country in my city apartment.<br />My favorite sounds are the rains, wind chimes, the night sounds, and the river.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I chose this rating because it gave me all the information I needed. And I did like all the information that that category had. I would recommend this book to everyone on earth I guess.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|i really liked this movie, because it had great atmosphere. the soundtrack, actors and story are very good. its got just few action, but when mma superstar cung le starts to rock, its fun to see someone who knows his stuff. this movie tells you a lot of details and i felt i had to losten much more closely compared to avatar or other sci-fi movies. since the movie came out with litle marketing, i was lucky to see the movie at theatre and now own the bluray. lets hope we get to see the trilogy, as it was ment to be.<br /><br />Soundtrack: 5 Stars<br />Picture & Soundquality: 4 Stars<br />Movie: 5 stars
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Went right from the 1st book to the 2nd couldn't keep my hands off it.<br />Very good story as well
0316228532|5.0|Yes, this is by the author of the Harry Potter series.  No, this is NOT IN ANY WAY a book for children or young adults.<br />Let me start with a little background.  J.K. Rowling may be a multimillionaire now, but it is a very recent change in her condition.  While she has not said it outright, she grew up in at least a volatile home, if not an abusive one.  When she wrote the first Harry Potter she was \\"as poor as it is possible to be in Britain and not be homeless.\\"  So when she writes about the harsh reality that her characters live in, she probably has seen it in real life.<br />A Casual Vacancy was billed as a dark comedy, but it is more of a tragedy written in the form of a character study.  The story is not so much action driven, as a snapshot of a town and it's inhabitants at a certain moment in time.  Many people will not like the book just because of these two things.<br />Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Parrish (town) council in Pagford, drops dead of an aneurysm in the golf club parking lot on his wedding anniversary.  After a brief mourning period people in the town begin to scheme and plan as to who should fill his seat on the council, as the council is about to decide on a controversial matter.  Pagford is trying to shuffle off the responsibility for The Fields (the local ghetto neighborhood)to Yarvile, the larger town in the district.  Along with with this, they are trying to evict the methadone clinic in the fields from their current building, which the Parish owns.  The lines are clearly divided, and it will be a close vote.  As the election moves closer accusations against various council members and candidates appear on the council website under the name \\"The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother,\\" and tensions in the town are flying high.  But there is more at stake than anyone really understands.  Ms. Rowling is very blunt about the reality that her characters live in.  This book portrays spousal and child abuse, both physical and mental, drug usage, rape, bullying, self-mutilation, and  death without blinking an eye.  She gives the reader no quarter.<br />Ms. Rowling uses this situation to show exactly how damaging the current movement of austerity is, and how far reaching the ramifications are.  What you may see as \\"common sense politics\\" may be the difference between life and death, food and hunger, abuse and safety, for someone else.  These decisions have real-life consequences that go far beyond your own pocketbook.  This book is very, very good, and it is utterly heartbreaking.  As I finished the last chapters of the book, with tears running down my cheeks, I had one phrase running through my mind.  Comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book with all the bad publicity.<br />I am very glad that I bought it 1
B002S9DRA6|5.0|I like it very much. It does the job it was made to do. I use it almost every day.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Sad that the story ended...I actually enjoyed reading all 3 books.<br />Wasn't sure with all the sexual items...but glad I did.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I bought these to use for educational podcasts and two-hour classes I teach online. (Web-based seminars) That means I do most of the talking. Before I review the quality of each aspect of this product you MUST know about autoshutoff:<br /><br />This headset has a built-in feature called &#34;Autoshutoff&#34; which is not listed in the product description or any of the reviews. I found out about this defect the hard way: I was teaching a class two days ago and my students kept complaining about the sound cutting out. I had thought it was my Internet connection or GoToWebinar, but it turned out that the G930 was shutting itself off with no warning (no beep, no blink). I kept talking and never knew that no one could hear me. I spent two hours researching the problem and found a two-year old (2011) forum thread on Logitech's community forum where several people had complained about this and been told by Logitech that this is a design function and that there was no solution. If you do not continually keep noise pumping through the headphones the unit will shut off in a few minutes. It doesn't matter how much you speak--the only variable is whether there is sound coming through the headphones (someone else is speaking).<br /><br />Then I found a new post from Logitech (Feb 2013) in response to brand new complaints about this very problem. The post was a copy/paste job of the original &#34;official statement&#34; two years prior. Needless to say many customers posted their complaints in response. So, beware that these may cut out on you every few minutes. That said, here is my review of the material workmanship and the quality--when the thing is on. Also, please see my &#34;customer images.&#34;<br /><br />The headphone sound is stunning. For a stereo (&#34;two speaker&#34;) set-up it functions as a surround system, and with surround sound controls. This is easily Logitech's flagship headset. For gaming (where you are assaulted with noise) this is top-notch. The sound coming from the microphone is very good as well. The product works.<br /><br />As to the manufacture. I liked the calibrated metal slide (adjustable height for different sized heads). This was extremely well crafted and the markings were a nice touch. I never caught my hair in the slide either. Very important that you can take your headset off quickly and not have hair yanked out of your skull. The ear covers fully and completely cover your ears--and I have some big ears. They enclose your entire ear and shut out a lot of the outside world. Once you turn up the volume to 11, everything else fades away. The mic is repositionable, so you can have it close to your face or far away. Also, the ear covers (I don't want to say muffs, as you can tell by the images that they are foam encased speakers) BOTH rotate 15 or so (left/right, not a spinning rotation) degrees to allow you greater adjustment. These are extremely comfortable for short periods. After about 20 minutes they do get hot on your head.<br /><br />They have a solid weight to them but since they rest on your head that is not much of an issue. The head strap is cushy and soft--a real plus. The microphone does not hit your face, so that is not an issue, but it does rotate up, and at the point where it stops rotating (up) it has a nifty auto-mute function.<br /><br />The buttons are all on one side, which is a bit annoying, but I can see why. You have to learn teh feel. The rolling slider raises and lowers the volume very slowly (lots of spin for small adjustments), allowing you a fine-tune precision on incoming volume. The mic volume is adjustable by software. There are just so many buttons (mute, off/on, and the three &#34;G&#34; buttons) that it takes some serious getting used to. I had no use for the various pre-programmed voice changers, but then again I am neither a stalker, nor am I 8 years old. This might be a selling point to some customers.<br /><br />All in all I liked the product, but the autoshutoff whichis hard-coded into the product and NOT able to be disabled, combined with the complete lack of support, made me return them. But you will have to pry my Logitech K800 lighted keyboard, with it's extra squishy keys, from my cold-dead hands. Logitech screwed the pooch on this one. They could have easily had the go-to headset that saves people hundreds of dollars on professional-level gaming and studio-headsets, but that damned autoshutoff cannot be turned off.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game has me stumped on several levels, a little more challenging and a lot more frustrating. I like it.
B003VANOFY|1.0|After reviewing multiple headsets, I thought the Logitech G930 was &#34;the ONE&#34;.  It's an awesome headset when it actually works.  I'm on my 2nd replacement headset and have had to send back 2 already (the one originally purchased from Amazon and a replacement that Logitech had sent out).<br /><br />Both times, the headset battery failed to charge.  Logitech should come up with a solution or get rid of the line of headsets and come out with a new one.  Don't bother buying this, it's well documented--just Google it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun way to waste the hours away.  Once I defeated all the levels I have gone back to get better scores.  It is fun and easy mindless distraction on a boring day.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|It takes 21 days to create a habit. Why not create an amazing life from the habit of positive thought found in The Magic? All things are possible if you believe. This book helped fine tune my thought process.  It's all good!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay  (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)<br />  The Hunger Games trilogy is written for a teen age audience but both young and old will both enjoy.  Many surprising and unexpected turn of events will keep everyone waiting to see what will happen next, and although the outcome is not what you may expect the author leads the reader wanting to read more. I'll be forever waiting for books four,five and six of a trilogy.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|I wanted some new workout music and this fit the bill perfectly.  I have never owned any GNR albums even though I have heard almost all of their songs, so I am really excited to have bought this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this trilogy.  Can't wait to read the next one.  I don't know what I will do when I finish the trilogy.
B009Z5BPZK|3.0|USPS is such a joke. I never received this item; had to re-order it and thankfully it was delivered by UPS which gets things right. The last season of gossip girl is over-priced since you only get half a season but everyone has to complete their collection so we pay the price. I loved the evolution of gossip girl and have watched every episode. Don't buy this unless you have all the other seasons.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Exactly what you would get if you walked into a movie store to purchase this DVD. Great condition, priced low, but shipping was a little slow.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Perhaps the best Grisham I've read in a while.  Complex characters.  Complex plot with many twists.  I was about to give up on Grisham but this book has kept me a fan of his.  You'll love this one!
B004J2TPSI|1.0|Needs to stay tethered to work, doesn't work as advertised.<br />Connects BT easily to Bose system though, transmits clearly.<br />A shame it's not charging...
B002L3ARRU|5.0|The title says it all: This movie is a classic.  The principal is incredibly funny-- and Ferris is incredibly &#34;slick.&#34;  What a hoot!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like the fact that it is very 3D.  It makes it a little more challenging than a standard match game.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Clearly, this cd is not just for Twilight fans (if you are willing to be open-minded).  I love Alternative Rock, and this compilation is really great.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp.<br /><br />Fun romp with the Dark Shadows clan.  Especially enjoyed seeing members of the original cast in their cameo,  entering the party as towns people.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love Zooey Deschanel and her unique voice.  The sound of She & Him is so quirky, alternative and fun.  Great cd!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Original UK Version Season 2<br /><br />Masterful acting with style and substance. Great period piece with current themes throughout.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I love this band ever since the beginning. In this CD, they discover new ways of expressing themselves musically.  I think the cd is just as good as the others (even if Rihanna sings in one of the songs).
B004YCKK46|5.0|A friend had told me this was one of her favorite movies & now it's one of mine!! Deniro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric & Brad Pitt weave a tale you won't forget. If you haven't seen it, buy it, you'll want this movie in your library.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Obviously I am a fan, but I really love this movie and the dynamics between the three main characters in this story.  Thanks, Amazon for such a speedy delivery.
B0000CAXID|5.0|Almost like listening to recordings of the Beatles in Hamburg: the early recordings of a band destined for greatness and the Hall of Fame. Dave Grohl will go down in history as one of the great American rockers!
B003CFBQBW|4.0|Good compilation for the movie.  Once again, great Alternative Rock bands supplied catchy, unique songs for the soundtrack.  I would suggest the product to any alt rock lover.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Can't go wrong with Dylan and Scorcese! I love Dylan and this is a fascinating look at his private side and his own thoughts about himself.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This extension was just the trick. It got my usb wireless receiver closer to the router and now the signal is great! Plugged it in and it worked.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This film is a classic: very unsettling, believable and raises a lot of questions. An all-time favorite on my personal best list!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Very fun and challenging.  You can excel without using $$ but you have to play a lot.  Multiplayer is slow at times for the joining member.  Sometimes your attacks don't register at all.  It takes some getting used to.  Beautiful and enjoyable game nonetheless.  4.5.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Okay first of all, very seldom do I ever leave a review, but when I do it is because the book captivated me and I couldnt put it down. This was one of those books. I loved it and I am kind of mad at the writer. Some of us have to get up and go to work and I found my self reading until three in the morning because I I couldn't put it down. I read this book in like three days, something that I never do. Good job...keep writing you have a unique talent. I will be reading more from this author for sure.

B001TOD92C|5.0|This is the very best movie I have ever seen on wrestling, professional or otherwise. This is my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Not to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but a one time star of professional wrestling, cannot retire. Wrestling is all that he knows, although he tries to supplement his income between Indy shows, by working at a grocery store. He tries to retire after a near fatal heart attack and rekindle a relationship with the only family he has left. But one night of partying causes him to lose the family, the job and then ultimately his life, which in the end is truly all he had left to lose. Sad, but brilliantly honest, for a piece that could have been a real life true story.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|I was confused yet liked the story line. The actors were wonderful great job by all. A deff tear jerker...
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I am so glad.  I would recommend this to anyone but especially for those who think a loved one is headed in the direction of Alzheimer's. a quick and compelling read!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|If you do not &#34;get&#34; Tim Burton, this movie may not thrill you, but the art is incredible. You have to consider the pain-stacking stop-motion work despite the odd story-line. This is art at its best. I was only sad that he didn't work with Johny Depp on this one.
B00BHMEALA|2.0|a restricted stripe . refused to replay - a border that kept popping up - a 2 inch black stripe top and bottom of screen - sound too faint to hear - no problem at all with netflix on my system (an Imac with latest OS and 27 inch screen - plays DVDs and Netflix flawlessly<br /><br />The above comments were my negative feedback, but it refused to submit them - it thought I was playing 2 at once, but wasn't - during play, a 2 inch black stripe top and bottom - a border that kept popping into those areas - very distracting - sound too faint to hear - overall, a bad viewing experience<br /><br />I'm off to get a refund - Amazon instant video not there yet.
B005LAIISA|3.0|Why did this do another version of this movie? It's all the same. This version was just more violent and when you thought it could have a really nice ending, they robbed us of that too. Hint, tiger have a mate. Ug.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Richard Thompson is a true artist, he has written songs that hold up to any other<br />songwriter, one could argue that it was he who birthed the genre of &#34;Folk Rock&#34;.<br />Rolling Stone magazine erroneously placed him at 27th(?) in the top 100 guitarists<br />&#34;ever&#34;. He created a sophisticated style of playing that is instantly recognizable and<br />few others can even attempt to recreate without sounding second rate. Lyrically his<br />songs are contemporary adaptations of British Isles folk traditions--William Blake with<br />an incendiary guitar. Few other songwriters at his age can boast that their skills are still<br />on the ascent (Robyn Hitchcock, Tom Waits, Dylan with his second wind, Rikki Lee Jones,<br />David Olney and of course Leonard Cohen all spring to mind), enough praise.<br />  After repeated listening this double disc collection of songs seems to this fan to<br />be right up there with his best. I have to listen to the songs Stoney Ground and Straight<br />And Narrow twice each time I put this CD on (every day) as I am a sucker for his scorching<br />rockers. The Snow Goose, Salford Sunday, Another Small Thing In Her Favour and Saving<br />The Good Stuff For You are all great ballads--the only songs that don't do it for me are<br />Where's Home and Good Things Happen To Bad People--16 out of 18 winners is quite impressive.<br />  It angered me to see Mumford & Sons at the Grammy Awards this year knowing that RT invented<br />the style of music that they play and that M&S will probably never write or play with the chops<br />that Mr. Thompson exhibits. RT's last twenty CDs should win him some fame and fortune, but the<br />awards always seem to go to some mediocre upstarts--there seems to be no justice in this pop culture.
B008Y1YKE4|3.0|Seller was great, but this tale of Christmas was awful in many ways. If you don't want a spoiler, don't read, but Christmas now comes from an &#34;alien&#34; sort of ship delivered by thousands of odd looking elves and Santa is just &#34;in charge&#34; - an old sort of &#34;out of it&#34; guy. It is not a classic I will want to watch again. There were terrible moments that made me want to cry. How is that a happy Christmas?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing.....Love the ending, brought tears and chills all at once. Nicholas Sparks never ceases to amaze me! Makes me smile.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|They rock.  Also did I mention that they rock.  If you like music that rocks then you should check them out, because they rock.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie was thrilling as it was terrifying! When the six \\"Canidi-cans\\" are walking through the market area, you could feel the fear they must have been feeling. Argo crescendos to an on-the-edge-of-your-seat depiction of true events that have just been de-classified after 17 years. I know my heart was beating faster all the way to the climatic end!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I love this game but it restarted three times, lost all of my progress. THREE TIMES. had to start from scratch THREE TIMES.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Their permissions are ridiculous.  I love that Amazon forces companies to list their &quot;privacy invasions&quot;.  But I wish they would go further insisting that each and every permission request also detail in nontechnical terms what it means and why they specifically need it.  it would force them to come clean and a lot of the sleeze would be cleaned up.  They should also have to list their &quot;in app &quot; purchases up front stating the cost and what it gets you.  Thank you to all of you who did make this purchase and took the time to warn the rest of us. I'm desperately seeking an app that would be compatible with my MAC AND KIndle and perhaps this would fit the bill,  but I will keep looking.  Thanks again reviewers for preventing others from wasting our money and having to go through what you did
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Basically Subway Sufers is a great game except for one problem.. its not updating. I heard about the update and eagerly wanted to play but it was still Rio. It gave me the option the download it which I did both with browser and Appstore. Any ideas on what's up?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Excellent--fun to read in parts, sad in other parts but the author made the most of his subject.  Would highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This by far one of the most amazing books I've read. It passion, love, pain, and sacrifice all in 3 amazing books. You'll be trapped by this amazing love story!!!
B000JMKNV0|2.0|Not my style--wanted to see what the local author had to offer--not a very pleasant subject and told told in an upsetting manner.  Writing style ok though.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of the first season of Game of Thrones, as well as the entire book series. I waited almost 2 years to order this as I no longer got HBO. I have watched season one at least, and not kidding, 50 times since I bought it. I recommend it to EVERYONE, gushing about the amazing story lines and characters and the genius of George R R Martin as a writer.<br /><br />HOWEVER, season 2 SUCKED. Not nearly the depth of the first season, and even the actors that stayed are not as true to life. The story line is choppy, with soooo many IMPORTANT scenes missing from the books as well as adding long, boring scenes that weren't in them and make no lasting impression. Leaving out important secondary characters and missing whole scenes that I feel were necessary to the the tale was a mistake. That kept this season from being as full and rich and complete as the first.<br /><br />Sorely disappointed. If I could send a movie back because I didn't like it, I would.<br /><br />CORRECTION: I HAVE WATCHED THIS SEVERAL TIMES NOW, AND SEPARATED MY FEELINGS FOR THE BOOK FROM MY FEELINGS FROM THE MOVIES. THIS ACTUALLY IS A GREAT SEASON, IT JUST INCLUDES SEVERAL LONG AND BORING EXTRA SCENES AND IGNORES OTHER ACTUAL IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE STORY. I CHANGE MY RATING TO 4.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved it.  Ben Affleck is a total bamf.  Even though I knew the ending I was still on the edge of my chair.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|excellent book describing his tours in the middle east, what it was like to live and become a navy seal, fight in war then come back and try to integrate into society.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|The only problem this is too close to the true world of politics. FRIGHTENING! Not for anyone who believes that politicians are there for anyone but themselves.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have never really been a Nicholas Sparks fan, but I loved this book. I thought the characters were interesting, the story kept me turning pages into the wee hours of the night, and the ending was a total surprise! I would definitely recommend this book to both NS lovers as well as others (like me) whose Sparks-knowledge stops at The Notebook. Great read!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I absolutely enjoy this. Sleep has never been better. Sweet sleep and rest indeed. I use this almost every night. Instant winner in my book. No if ands or buts about it. A must have.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This wasn't a very good movie because the plot was so disorganized, depressing, and contained too many redundant flashbacks. Most of the characters were annoying and pretentious. The sub-plot with the little boy and mother who have magical powers was interesting but that didn't save this movie from being really boring. Another disappointing aspect is that for a science fiction movie there wasn't a lot of science fiction. This isn't a classic like Blade Runner or Star Wars. Grade: C-
B008PZ69RU|4.0|This movie is very good. I enjoyed it very much,i think each character was perfect in the roll they played. Its one I will enjoy over and over.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great game, 'nuff said. I've installed this on all my devices and computers. A must have for any puzzle style game lover.
B00594XOZU|5.0|15/f/bi. looking for a nice girl or boy to talk too. NO nudes. im cool af to talk to and keep a conversation going too! kik me! user name up top ^^^^^&hellip; no boring people either and must have a profile picture as well : ))
B001QVFDA4|5.0|I thought this was good fun. This was fast moving.  . The mix of action and comedy was really great.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|Excellent depth in the character development.  Snyder really hit the mark with this story.  Looking forward to reading more on this storyline.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|I felt this movie had the right mix of a serious story of a family in conflict and action scenes.
B00445RHKI|5.0|I love this show! I came to it late so I like that I can watch prior seasons.  The whole family makes me laugh.  I love the absurd situations Phil often finds himself in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun and addicting. Being able go change boards and your character is a cool feature. Having it change from New York then Rio then Rome is cool It keeps it fresh and not boring.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I really liked reading this book.  It was difficult to put down and was very entertaining.  It's a definite recommendation for anyone wishing to read a classic novel.

B000JMLFLW|2.0|I like to read and I try to catch up on the classics.  I purchased this book because I knew it was considered a classic, but I couldn't get into it and put it down before finishing the second chapter.  It's not for men.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Just like I remembered! So great! Such a classic. I had forgotten how good Space Jam really is. MJ is awesome.
B0063IH60K|3.0|We all know solitaire.  This game is just like so many others, but helps pass the time away when one is looking for a non-complicated game to pass the time away.
0767834739|5.0|The entire time of being a Resident Evil fan, I had never watched this one for some reason.  I'm glad I bought it!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|It's simply a great album performed by a great artist.  She's a great song writer who will be cherished for a long time.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the whole series!  I even downloaded songs from the soundtrack.  Anyone who is a faithful Resident Evil fan will enjoy it.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|As with many classics, this is a book many should read.  It's not complicated and the stories are intriguing, even if a little far fetched as to the deductive reasoning of Mr. Holmes.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|I think this was a close best for Milla Jovovich out of all of the series.  Again, fans will love this movie.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this product. Actually I have to order more now as I have nearly used the entire contents of the syringe in performing laptop repairs. Great product and superior performance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the whole concept of the game! almost a mix of free running and fancy ninja skills. :) needs more levels and variety of obstacles.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|These films are a few of my favorites and they look even better on blu-ray!!! Just awesome!!!<br /><br />This collection is highly recommended!!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Or at least what my nephews thought. They loved these (Epic and Rookie) so much that they took them to bed with them and when they got up on Saturday morning, they played with these instead of watching cartoons. That has never happened!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|One of the greatest book I have ever read.<br />The best way to end the saga.is worth the money.<br />FANTASTIC job..
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent cast.  Excellent writing.  Julian Fellowses never fails to entertain us with the characters that make up the world of Downton.  I am so happy that PBS puts out the UK edition, since what is shown here in on our local channels is condensed.  I also enjoy all the extra's that come on the DVD's.
1451629192|5.0|Intense story, left me in shock for weeks, read it in one sitting - I think it's important to know this story - so many lessons learned from reading it
B00992CF6W|2.0|I downloaded the game but it would not install it even charged me! my friend.played the game and it loooked fun but I.cant get it know
B000VNMMQG|3.0|Based on the raves of a number of my friends, I expected to love this film.  It was okay, quite well done, but it wasn't my taste.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book! Hooked after first page and could not stop reading until the end was forced upon me.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|And season 3 was just as intense and inventive as I expected.  Can't wait for Season 4 to be released.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|The book was dull and boring. It was recommended to me so I read the entire novel and it just never took off. Oh well I am certain the author is a pleasant person but had deep connections in publishing!
0307748995|5.0|This compelling novel is read by Toni Morrison - whose writing and voice brings intimacy, warmth and just the right tone.  I have a very long commute and I was sad when the CDs ended.  It's not often I find everything I want in one package.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend! Man he didn't disappoint! This book has a lot of twists and turns. Some you think you are right about and then she throws a curve ball. If you like happy endings though, this is  not your writer. Great read!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this game is so fun and challenging that I just got it about ten minutes ago and I entirelly forgot i had work!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second offering from Mr. Martin is so good! I loved the characters! I keep rooting for the Stark's but something tells me that I am going to be a little saddened at the end of the series. He gives you characters that you love to hate and ones that you root for and read faster to get to their chapters!
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|at first i was like &quot;oh boy a new HO game!&quot;, but i really don't like this one. the HO scenes are just too junky for my taste. like another reviewer mentioned there is nothing to this game but collect and then go to another HO. just not my cup of tea!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I first heard about this series a couple years ago from my cubbie buddy at work. I didn't pay attention to his geeky ways until the series came out. This book is so awesome! And for once the show was right on track with the book! The one that started it all and it was so good!!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The story line is not bad and the characters are reasonably developed.  The coverage of history is generally adequate, even though Follett paints all liberals as enlightened heroes to humanity and conservatives as corrupt, cigar-chomping war mongers.  Still, i am starting to feel like I am trapped in bed with the flu and the only channel that comes in is the artist teaching how to paint a formulaic landscape in a 30-minute show.  Though I love historical novels (and have read most of Follett's works), not sure I will read the third book of this trilogy.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've only been playing this game since Jan 2013 (2 months). And I'm loving the challenge very much! It has actually improved my very bad memory. I am forgeting things less! :) Would be nice to play against others. I am now trying to get all my times AT OR UNDER 3 min.! ;) MY personal goal. Thanks. Looking forward to more more more levels! :)
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|A perfect Christmas gift.  We have given this four times, and got profuse thanks from the recipients.  A wonderful show, it has become part of our family Christmas tradition.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|What i did not like was once the game updated it self it froze and now wont work anymore other wise i love the game i still wish it worked for me
1616550414|5.0|It was worth every penny! As an loz fan I enjoyed reading how the creators did what they had to do to make the amazing games! If you love the legend of zelda then I totally recommend it for you :D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Play it on my kindle all the time and I love it and it is addicting. Good game to play when your bored as well
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The product is addictiong and very enjoyable and I regimens N'djamena bdjdjndniwq njxjjd dhpp you enjoy it thanks hdn mdncr
B005LAIH5O|4.0|A great sequel.  I liked it better than the first movie.  Great special effects, action and the ending was also better than the first.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Omg I fell in love with this game when I played it. its so fun!!! I got the lite one which was free buy it its fun and when your bored play this totally worth it
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A classic comedy about how families, no matter how dysfunctional, can pull together for each other. The actors portrayed the characters so well and the laughs were heart felt.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's definitely the best game I have downloaded on my kindle fire. I love the missions, and how the game always goes to different cities, so it makes the game fun and doesn't get boring, like most games.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This was just as good or not better than the first Sherlock done by Guy Richie.  Love Jude Law and can't give enough kudos to Robert Downey Jr.  What a hoot.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse looks great and the design is nice but it is a little big.  If you are a palm grip person then it may not bother you but as a claw grip person it just didn't feel right.  There are almost too many DPI settings as well.  I tried all of the default settings and none of them quite worked right but if you are the type of person who likes to spend a good amount of time experimenting and getting the DPI exactly right then I am sure you won't mind.  There are definitely a lot of settings options.  I am sure this would be a great mouse for certain people but it isn't right for me.  Sending it back.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I liked it and was glad I finished it, but it was a bit of a struggle and I did consider not finishing it. The last quarter of the book began to come together so that I wanted to know the ending and it was good,  I wasn't drawn it at the beginning as I had been with her other work and it really dragged through the middle.  So the 3 stars was all I could do for this one.  OK, but not great.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Good to know that this program is available for Kindles since most Doc's and books are in this format. Works great!
B0014JKJHK|1.0|worst pair of crocs i have EVER purchased.  Will stick to other styles in the future. Maybe ok for some....not for me
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I play tons of sudoku on android and iphone and so far best ive seen on both system, hands down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! My and my partner spend hours playing this trying to beat each other's score! And the added bonus of trying to beat friends on facebook too is great! Would recommend this game to everyone!!! And the best bit is that it's FREE :D
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Geeked out on this book, music, tv, movies, dnd and videogames all in one excellent adventure story. Thanks for the fun ride!
B008X6N1OA|5.0|What a deal for a great movie~I paid like 10 dollars and its great in blu-ray!! cant beat the price.
B007WKEM8C|2.0|I don't know if it's me but the amounts of butter and salt seem off... Way to high!!<br /> I do love the pictures and ideas though.<br />I also think that the commentary goes on for too long...  making it seem more important than the recipes sometimes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy this app and was very excited to see the new Rome upgrade but I am unable to get it to download and am afraid I will have to uninstall and redownload but I don't want to lose my high score or coins hope its not a ploy to make me purchase coins :(
B00005N5S2|3.0|Movie is a hollywood version of the facts. The major events were accurate but the facts about the man were less then accurate. His true contributions to history were the post war establishment of a government in Japan and the Inchan landing. He was caught unprepared in the Philappines and Korea but unlike other high ranking personnel was never held accountable.
B009XWD02G|5.0|It halls to have this therefore I installed it. I wave n.o foible getting what I need when I need it
B008JFUUIA|3.0|You saw all the funny parts in the trailer. A few gross parts, and Fat Amy stole the show, in a good way.
B0009UC810|5.0|Looks great. We enjoyed watching it together. We haven't seen this movie in a long time, so it was a fun 'date night' for us.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I liked the first one. Not for the story line. Only the action. Couldn't get into this movie at all. Only good part was with Mr A.S.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Bought this to share with my 4 year old grand son.  He loves Lion King and it is a special time for us to watch it together.
B000YGIIQI|5.0|I love Chef Ramsay but I never imagined what this man has been through and the things he has overcome.  Funny guy, amazing chef, absolute inspiration.  Must read for everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I tried to figure out $20 divided by $3 and it gave me 6.6666666! And it took me a while to find the amount! But in sometimes it helps me with simple problems such as 247 added to 319.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I was skeptical knowing it was about a dog, but it was excellent and now I recommend it to others!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun &amp; totally addicting! I lose time when I'm playing this game.  I totally recommend this app!!!!!'
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Following up to Beautiful Creatures, this was a good sequel. Parts were repetitive and a bit predictable but still a solid read.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My toddler loves this app. She asks for it every day. We did upgrade to the pay version so she could get more pictures.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I'm a physical therapist who sees home health patients, mostly seniors, mostly deaf or half-deaf.  Do they wear their hearing aids? No they don't.  I was weary of getting a sore throat every day from having to scream at them and my friends always asking me why I talk so loud, so I went on a mission to find a solution.  I tried 3 different products and settled on this one. Not only am I impressed with how well it works, so are my colleagues and my patients.  It's lightweight, portable, requires only one small battery and works astronishingly well.  Problem solved.
1419701533|4.0|This series is excellent and funny. My kids love these stories and this hard cover set is perfect for them. These books are durable and the box they came in is great. We will get many years of use out these.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|it was great i loved sharing this time with the kids, hudband mother in law, and brother in law!!! great family movie!!!
B0064NTZKI|5.0|If you're a Woody Allen fan, this documentary is a must have. There's lots of great information about his life and career. The DVD is entertaining and very funny in parts. I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|A lot better than the prequel, but I still prefer Running Fred. Temple Run 2 is much nicer in terms of graphics, the effects are somewhat improved and there is a lot more variation to it.<br /><br />Still, it's pretty much the same lane-browser as the original (and that is one of the reason because I like more Running Fred type of games). The animations were improved and there is a new part in the game where you are on a mine cart.<br /><br />I'd say, if you liked the original Temple Run, you're surely going to enjoy the sequel. Otherwise, there's plenty of far more interesting options out there.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is a really good CD. I love this band and listen to it while I work. It is great Massage Music!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to navigate. It Works great on my Kindle Fire. Great way to keep up with my family & friends.

0525478817|2.0|then it becomes silly and unconvincing. Where is an Editor when the writer needs one? Please try again, John green.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This  as a good purchase. I highly recommend it. Works great on my kindle fire despite what some negative reviews say.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|bought it for my daughter and it was good up until its first drop! the corner of the case busted and came off? weird for a lifeproof case to be dropped and then chip the corner. honestly this must be a knock off of a lifeproof case. dont waste the time or money on this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its fun for horse lovers. I think lots of kids will love this game its really cool so get it its free
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Powerful, moving, suspenseful, and life affirming.  Argo has it all!  The CIA agent and the six Americans he rescued are all heros and amazingly brave.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is addicting and fun. Better then temple run. Good concept and love it. Only thing I would like to get is for things like boards and people to cost less.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Not much else to say. Got it so my grandson and I could enjoy it and he did.  Just as much as I did.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Epic game. Would be worth 3.99. It's FREEEEE. Only thing Is, lots of glitches, I rate a four. OTHER THAN glitches, it's epic.
0547848412|5.0|So, I saw the movie first and I really enjoyed it and decided to read the book after watching it. This book evoked so many emotions while I was reading it.  I got so pissed at that stupid hyena. I think I hate hyenas now, lol...Pi's journey was so extreme I just kept putting myself in his shoes and I felt like I was totally there. It was definitely worth reading. The writer did tend to ramble on and on when describing things sometimes but other then that it was a very well writen book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this to keep in my kitchen drawer to sharpen my EDC folder when needed.  The sharpener does a fair job on knives and gives them a decent edge.  There are better systems out there for this task, but this one is tiny, can fit into your pocket if needed and is inexpensive.  I've discovered that not only do I use it for my EDC folder, but it has become my go to kitchen knife sharpener as well.  I give my kitchen chef's knife a go over before any big chopping job and my onions slice up like a dream.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The miscro USB cable works well. Cord arrived quickly and in the pristine condition promised. Very happy! A great find.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|Works exactly as it should. We have CaseMate Tough Extreme cases on our iphone 5's and have not had to remove the case to charge the phone. The car charger fits very tightly into my vehicles charging port - I had to use force to shove it in. I hope it loosens with time.
B005EKIYS6|5.0|I wrote awesome plastic toy because I can't even begin to think of how much money I've spent over the years on stupid plastic toys.  This toy was purchased for my 12 year old son for Christmas.  He loves it!  My 16 year old and my 9 year old love it also!  You've gotta love when a toy gets this much use. I believe that is the true sign of a quality  toy.<br /><br />oh my gosh - update - a year later!<br />yep they still love it!
B00AHJXRS6|5.0|Kingcrow has got stronger with each new album, with the last album being so strong , I didn't expect them to out do it, but that's just what they did with the best album to date, and sure to be one of the best releases of the year.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I love this book so so so so so so so so so ss so so so so much!!!!
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|Yes, Riverside has taken another step forward in creating their own unique style, and getting stronger with each new release. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game needs boats and mine carts. This game is not worth the money. If it had boats and mine carts it would be.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works great to access your other computers remotely. I haven't tried accessing completely off my network, but using it from a different router posed no problems. I love that I'm able to watch my shows off my media PC in bed since I don't have a television in my bedroom.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent author & choices of books from this author. My husband has enjoyed this author for years & now on his Kindle
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I definitely recommend reading this book. It help guide my thinking and opened up doors to more information that I could have ever imagined.  I guess that in and of itself proved that what u focus on u will bring more of that into your life. This book is simply amazing!

B008VBYN80|3.0|I don't think you should have to do quests that make you interact with people online or pay a gem. They should be optional. And don't make it so hard to regenerate or earn energy.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I enjoyed aprox 60% of this book. That sounds like it should be less than 3 stars but, the good parts are really good. I just thought sometimes it was too much to keep my attention. But still, the good parts are good. So, in order for you to make your choice, you should buy it and prove me wrong.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Its a pretty awesome game. of course its a little challenging but its a fun game to pass the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing. i like how it speeds up the farther you get. i also like how they travel around the world. it's pretty cool
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Saw CHASING MAVERICKS in the theaters.  BRAVO!  Best yet, they shot it in my old High School ...<br /><br />OCEANA HIGH SCHOOL<br />Pacifica, California<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me, is I wanted to be the first to shoot there.  Alas, I waited too long.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Puss in Boots is a classic.Its great watched over and over.  Wonderful to own it and thanks for the great service
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a great story, full of action, surprises, humor and a great main character who manages to keep you very interested in everything that is going on with him and Mars.  Need a weekend read, this is it.  Enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. Completely appropriate and great for kids. I love this game and cant say enough a bout it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow can not describe this book. It is a great read for anyone who likes to read young adult romance books. I would recommend this book to everyone. It also really makes you appreciate what you have in your life and the obstacles that people face.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game.  I have played similar games on my app.  Colors are bright.  Recommend this game for any age even above 60.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book it was so unbelievably amazing. I'm so excited to read walking disaster I'm counting down the days and I already have it preorder. :)
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Suzanne, I really loved all of the hunger games. Until this. I don't like it, at all. Everyone is saying Katniss breaks down, I'm saying why didn't she break down more? I'm not giving away spoilers, but when that bomb dropped, I started hating this book. I know this isn't Harry Potter, or Twilight, it's a lot better than that. But no. I really don't like this book at all. I might think different if I read it again but I doubt it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was by far my favorite ever. By the end of a book or a series I'm always left with questions or wonders but this amazing author answered everything and addressed everything I thought of (and I have read well over 200 books, and it is quite difficult for me to find an author such as James)!James is the first author I have come across that leaves the reader feeling completely fulfilled. I mean if James wrote another book I would read it in a heart because I can't stand when an author leaves you with questions or like you are missing a piece of the story at the end of the series.  Read all three books in three and a half days, Only stopping to shower. This series is a must read for anyone and everyone! =)
B005R32L66|5.0|I have used this app in the USA, as well as when I am overseas.  And it always works great.  It even works on a 3G connection.
B000GB775E|5.0|my girls love this movie and have watched it over and over. they lost it so this was a replacement
B004S5C8WG|5.0|This book had me intrigued from the first chapter, and I found it hard to put it down.  It is a book I would like to read again someday as I know that I would find more in it next6 time I read it.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|As always, the adventures of Tinkerbell and her friends was delightful!  Sweet and sassy at the same time - perfect for my four daughters!
B003IDMUT0|5.0|This book gives a really good description of living life as a missionary among the people in the forests of Brazil, while, also having connections with the world of crime in America.  I found it really good and enjoyed it very much.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Stargate Universe is a fantastic show. Season 1 is full of interesting characters and stories.  While not the original, it is still a very good show.
B003IDMUVI|5.0|Although John Grisham writes well about courtroom procedures, this has a greater depth of understanding into the minds of prisoners and the minds of decent men.  I found this a very intruguing book.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|It constantly has pop ups to buy the full version which my 2 year old tapped away at until he ended up buying the app on his own.  Not that good of an app in the first place.  Even after involuntarily paying for it, I still get pop ups to buy it again!  It's a scam.<br /><br />If you have one-click ordering on, you better disable it or you'll be paying for this app a dozen or more times if you have a little one that fearlessly can operate a Kindle.
B0051GY0LS|4.0|If you want intrigue with poor parenting, drugs and mystery combined you will find this book quite gripping. with good and bad all mixed in together.  I believe this book is suitable for all in today's world.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.As an avid reader I'm always hoping ,the book I'm starting will be one of those delights the Un putdownable one.Story takes lots of twists and turns,keeps you entralled to the last page
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Another very enjoytab le book by John Grisham.  At times it seemed that it was getting dlightly over-cookied, but thern an event would grab one's attention again resulting in making me wanting to read more urgently.  I think it gives a good insight of what happens in the American civil justice system and the way in which firms seek litigation, sometimes not quite with the best of results, but at other times with very worth-while results being obtasined.  I have al;ways enjoyed books by this author, and this was no exception
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They've been really stepping it up lately with the World Tour. The different scenes are so refreshing! So far Rio was my favorite.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting this release since I first heard read about it several months ago.  My expectations were high since I consider Justin to be one of the great songwriters of his generation.  It is hard for me to put into words the feeling his music gives me, but I can say his songs have taken me to places no one else can.  The album starts out with  a very Moody Blues sounding In Your Blue Eyes which is a nice mid-tempo rocker.  This is followed by \\"One Day, Someday\\", \\"The Western Sky\\" and \\"The Eastern Sun\\".  These 3 songs are the highlight of this release.  All three songs are acoustic driven ballads that are amazingly beautiful, each one a classic.  This is the strongest opening 4 songs Justin has put onto a recording and I am  including  View From a Hill which I thought was great.  On the Road to Love, co-written by Kenny Loggins rocks along nicely.  My only comment is after the peaceful trance the prior  3 songs had put me in the electric guitar sounded a bit jarring (and believe me I love to hear Justin play).  Perhaps it should have been placed elsewhere on the album.  The 3 bluegrass driven selections really change the tone of the CD but I thought they sounded good, with nice vocals and instrumentation.  The ending 3 songs dive into electronica.  Not really my thing but interesting to hear and certainly nice to include.  The only song I have doubts about was Captivated By You.  It sounded like two separate songs joined together.  The verses were smooth and softly rocking, while the chorus sounded a bit ominous.  The overall effect just didn't win me over -yet.  All in all just a great listening experience, we can only hope Justin keeps writing and releasing new material.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|Very well told story. Complex characters and times and circumstances. I have loved every book by Ian Mcewan I hae read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great book as usual from this author.  Gives a real feeling for police work.  Cops have to sift through seemingly unconnected data to find the ones responsible for a crime.
B0000640SA|5.0|I purchased this as a gift,  but the recipient was happy.  DVD set claims to come with all sorts of extras and Easter eggs, but I do not know how or if they were enjoyed.  The packaging is very creative.  Very nice.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Bought it for my wife. She drives home from work after midnight. Sings to this cd all the way home. It keeps her awake and she is in a great mood when she gets home.
0345803485|1.0|I have found this entertaining illustrated REVIEW which reflects perfectly how I feel and think about it - especially the conclusion:<br /><br />goodreads.com/review/show/340987215 (or just enter on Internet: \\"katrina's review 50\\" and it will come up)<br /><br />As of today, there are 6,730 negative (1 & 2 star) Amazon reviews for 7,674 five-star reviews, which is a good proportion of negative ones, but because of the hype people will go on buying it.<br /><br />Pity even young girls will feel they have to read this book because of the hype, curiosity and it having become a centre of conversation - they won't be able to unread this book.<br />This book will have a sad influence, after the possible 'enjoyment' (if any. Not for me) of reading has passed.<br />People think of protecting their bodies but not their minds or souls.<br /><br />For a year now pics & links of this trilogy were on my default Amazon page (not my choice, and I don't appreciate it of Amazon!), contributing to the hype and free advertising; people think they are free thinkers but just look what publicity can do.<br />(I admit btw that I only read parts of it, from a borrowed copy - not going to give more money to this woman).<br /><br />Personally, spiritual forms of sex such as TANTRIC SEX do more for me.<br /><br />(Example: [[ASIN:1903816378 Heart Tantric Sex Diana Richardson]] - Use the \\"Look Inside\\" feature, and scroll down to mid Page 49-50 for a good excerpt. Note: the selection is different on Amazon.com, no page 49).
B0076DELIG|3.0|I like Bosch and his daughter.  Will definitely read more books with him as main character...Very believable...and a great story
0871404133|5.0|This is an amazing work.  It seeks to understand and explain how one species, in a relative blink in the life of the earth, has come to achieve such dominion over the planet that we now threaten the very biosphere that gives us life.  It covers the evolutionary development of almost every aspect of human life, from art and religion to sex and war.  It compares humans to other socially advanced social species to try to explain our acquisition of the tools that have made our success possible.  It is the best work I have ever read in providing a broad perspective on the history of our species.  It is an extraordinary achievement of scientific research, scholarship, and writing--a crowing achievement in the work of one of the great minds of our time.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have watched the movie since I was a kid. The book let you know more about the characters and their adventures.
0805209999|5.0|Resistance to reading Kafka's most emblematic unfinished novel was largely the result of a suspicion on my part of any novelist who wilfully betrayed a reader's understandable desire to know what's Really Going On. If frustration were to be the only reward for having committed to reading the novel, then I didn't wish to join the Kafka reading club. Added to what was my suspicion of committing to an already clearly-stated intent to deceive was the fact that the novel is termed `unfinished'. So not only was Kafka determined from the outset to not allow his reader to rest on any easy ground of recognition, he also had the temerity to further undermine any desire to interpret by refusing to `finish' his novel. Oy vey! For over thirty years I've wanted nothing to do with him.<br /><br />I'm not proud of this stance; and to rectify matters I put aside my childish need for certitudes and I purchased a copy of the new translation of The Trial. I'm very glad that I did. It's a difficult novel to pin down and this may be why it has had such an enduring hold on our imaginations over the decades. Kafka's refusal to clearly articulate the subject matter of his novel places the reader in the same position as Josef K. The reader and the hero become one. This results in an almost compulsive desire on the part of the reader to find out what's going on; but where the one-to-one mapping breaks down is that Josef K. at many points in the novel won't ask obvious questions - questions that a reader would deem essential. He confounds his own need to know. Or perhaps it might be more productive to say that he betrays his need to know. If Knowledge is Power then Josef K. is the ultimate Helpless Man. As indeed are all the characters in the novel. Those on the `inside' of the Law are perfectly explicit in positing a hierarchy of Knowledge to which they have no access. They too are in some senses powerless. They cannot act in any other way. They are bound to the Guilty as the Guilty are bound to their `crimes'.<br /><br />The interpretive compulsion goes into high gear on reading The Trial and this is why so much has been allowed to be read `into' the novel. It's about Bureaucracy (in some Weberian way)! It's about Totalitarianism! It's about Existentialism! Is it? I honestly don't know. I do know that it's about a very ordinary, bourgeois man caught in a system that may very well be of his own making. How so? Because his route to redemption is travelled on the path of acceptance. He walks willingly, obligingly to his sacrificial death much as Isaac allowed himself to be placed on the altar by Abraham. Echoes of Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith abound. Submission to The Law is very much more than any legalistic Code. The Law is deeply religious in its presentation and symbolism in the novel.<br /><br />One can't help speculating on Josef K's guilt. It resides, for me, in his refusal in the course of his life to acknowledge or contemplate anything outside himself. He is a very small, petty, self-contained man who's crime and subsequent guilt forces him to confront, acknowledge, come-to-know and forgive, The Other. It's a marvellous novel and I'm so very glad that I read it. Finally.to their `crimes'.<br /><br />The interpretive compulsion goes into high gear on reading The Trial and this is why so much has been allowed to be read `into' the novel.

B008Q0AZVK|3.0|At first glance Bel Ami is a romp through 1890's Paris presenting  accomplished men and women and their flirtations and seductions.  It is that to be certain but beneath the obvious lie complicated  human emotions and behavior driving the characters to their ultimate end.  The women of the circle who pass Robert Patterson's character from one to another suffer emotional deficiencies that only he can soothe.  He himself is driven to use them with little remorse to achieve HIS ultimate goal.  The settings are pleasurable, lovely drawing rooms, costumes and some tasteful flesh on flesh scenes.  Watching the movie was time well spent.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Book sucks crap!! I hate it! Do not waste all your money on this crappy book!! Make another book I can complain on!! Gosh!
B001J1S4F2|4.0|Take a 17th century setting of beautiful villas, interiors and costumes, add a twisting plot full of manipulative characters acted by actors well up to the challenge  and you will not be able  to look away from Dangerous Liaisons.  Glenn Close and John Malkovich play their parts to perfection.  Spite, cruelty and insincerity challenge innocence and trust in the characters of Michelle Pffiefer and Kyanu Reeves.  John Malkovich's performance alone keeps me coming back to this movie time and time again.
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|the beginning did not attract the attention of the viewer and when they travel into the future the Earth looked exactly the same.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|I absolutely loved this movie, until I saw Fracknation.  When I saw Fracknation my first thought was what a bunch of right wing bullcrap.  Then after doing some research and actually fact checking Gasland I've discovered while Fox might have had good intent in his heart he filled a movie with lies, deceit, and downright harmful information.  Unfortunately thousands of people's lives will suffer b/c of this movie.  On top of that Russia will still have a stranglehold on the eastern world.<br /><br />Plus most of the farmers where this would take place are living month to month trying not to sell the family farm.  Many, too many, of them have had to sell.  This farmland and forest is now being developed into neighborhoods and complexes.  That sounds even worse for the environment!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great free app! Easy to read and use.  My only kindle fire calculator and have recommended it to others in my family.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I've been a MJ fan since I was 4 and this deluxe edition is awesome! The way it was put together is incredible! I love the unreleased tracks especially I'm So Blue and Al Capone. The Wembley DVD is great too. This is the perfect anniversary tribute to one of the greatest albums ever made!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague Inc is a very slick game with solid basic play and subtle strategic changes required to win while changing from pathogen to pathogen.  It's become quite popular (and stress relieving) at the pharmaceutical plant I work at.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|It is my intention to purchase every season before the end of 2013. I must say this though, this is one series that ended too soon. I will miss this show immensely!! It could have held it's longevity like Star Trek Next Generation or The X-Files!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie has such inspiration and feeling - dogs are precious, a man's best friend, I look at Hachi from time to time
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved this game! I liked that it was pretty long. Worth the money definitely. A lot of different hidden object scenes and fun mini games.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|You like strange type films? This one is a must see then... If you can rent it or Netflix it, I'd recommend that over buying, but if you do buy, I don't think you'll be dissapointed. Great movie to watch if you're some kind of a psychology major and you're looking to write a pesky term paper about people with a strange hardwire setup in their brain. No characters portrayed here are &#34;bad&#34; people, just people who are wired for something that isn't &#34;normal&#34; in order to &#34;feel&#34; normal. Good movie. Deep subjects. I liked.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I purchased this product for myself since I'm a huge P&P fan. The quality is great, the Blu-ray is fantastic and the digital copy makes sure you don't wear out your disks too soon. Perfect gift for a P&P fan.
B0091REZMW|4.0|First Kindle compatible game that was worth the time to download. Easy to play and fun to boot! Fun for any gamer who likes hidden object games and mystery.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This movie was amazing! It's one of those life changers! Really makes you appreciate his music so much more and respect him for everything he did and stood for! For all you reggae fans, this is a MUST WATCH. Bob Marley is truly legend and this documentary tells it all.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think this is a Awesome app. I like that it has slot of free puzzles. I would recommend with no problem.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|There are so many people giving this book bad ratings, their reason being that it's nothing new in the world of literature. To these people I must say, that ideas are never original creations and that they have been &#34;recycled&#34; since the first stories were told by mouth. The evolution of ideas has changed, yes and ideas get more complex, refined--some just never make it there. There are by far worse books out there and it must be the good luck of the people who rated this book one star that they have never read such drivel.<br /><br />As far as The City of Bones is concerned, I found it an extremely easy read, which when it comes to fiction--I adore--fiction should be an outlet, something that can take you out of your world momentarily to somewhere extraordinary. Cassandra Clare did that for me and I should be so lucky to write a book that is as successful as this in the future. I got through this book in a total of about  five or six solid hours (over the course of a few days) and was glad to begin reading the second. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed supernatural themes in literature.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, though, when you read books--don't compare them to every other book you have ever read. Take them as stand-alone ideas, or at least give them a chance to immerse you in something new. If you want to compare this book to Harry Potter and say that it's too similar, go ahead. I think that would actually be a compliment to the author, to say that you thought of such a wonderful series when you read her work. On the other hand, if you're throwing around such accusations in the attempt to say every book in the world needs to originate from a brand new idea, then you're clearly never satisfied when reading fiction.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is an amazing book and i think all would enjoy,mostly women of course...lol<br />Please just check this out you will love it.

B009X01GJ2|5.0|This is a nice choice to protect your Kindle.  I like the strap that keeps it closed.  But what I really like is the way you can switch from horizontal to vertical viewing and still use the stand.  My Kindle is quite heavy and I'm glad I can set it down and use it hands free.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Just love the different styles she brings out; not something you expect to hear from a violin. Awesome music to blair while working out or cleaning or great to have on for background while curled up with a good book.

B004UIOUHC|2.0|I have always wanted to use Opera products...rooting for the underdog... but just like their desktop browser is of no use to me (doesn't work with Amazon), their mobile product came up lacking.  Sorry guys, I know you are sticking to your guns of developing to the standards, but the web sites aren't adhering to them, so your product doesn't work on lots of prominent sites.  Some of the stuff you do is really innovative(like the rewind button etc), but if I can't &#34;Proceed to Checkout&#34; on Amazon using your browser, then I am not going to use your browser.  Your browser displays a blank page when I click the yellow &#34;Proceed to Checkout&#34; button and thus, this app has been removed.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome game! Very addictive and fun. A great game for when you need something to do while waiting or for in the car.
0385535147|3.0|This book excited me for around 160 pages and then I felt like there where too many things going on at the same time. I got confused and I felt like some of the exciting stuff I was looking forward to just let to another event.<br />In the end I was kind of dissapointed. A hardcover book for a married man who is a student and who live in South Korea, is not a cheap experience.<br />Some people will love this book and for some people this book just not connect. Maybe that is what makes a good book?? Just thinking aloud<br /><br />Emil Lavsen
B0090X4HES|4.0|The thing I enjoyed most about this album is that Kendrick Lamar is revisiting the lost art of story telling, something that only Drake and Eminem have done well in the last generation of rap phenoms. I believe this young man, if careful in selecting his collaborators, should have a successful sophomore effort as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a awesome<br />I love it and if you don't like it then you are crazy. AWESOME!!!!!!!<br />My whole family loves it
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|My husband discovered this game 20 years ago.  He has never been on the internet and does not own a cell phone. My son's friends played it and loved it so I bought it for them.  Who knew??  Makes me want to dig out my Atari.

B000YADE04|5.0|One of my personal favorite movies and I couldnt find it in the stores.<br />I LOVE IT great vendor I would use them again
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Cool graphics and storyline!!! Puzzles aren't overly hard like some other games g5 has. I would recommend to friends and family.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Though I do get occasional innacurate readings I realize this is not the fault of the app itself.  Mostly accurate and easily read forecasts are all I need.  Radar is a nice extra and I like that the map is large.  Good price, too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally addictive game i have to play it everyday ive fallen asleep many times palying this I highly recomend this game!!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Whenever a band's first album goes monster we can say good luck with the second one. Seems to be a 'pay your dues' sort of thing, start off slow and grow. Mumford's first album was great, my son got me into them. I like the folk influence with acoustic instruments like a banjo.<br />This new album, Babel, I loved even more, it is better on so many levels. Greater variation in the melody, stronger lyrics. I liked it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I finished this book several weeks ago but the characters and the story stays with me.  Difficult situations revealed real responses from all the characters - not sugar-coated or wrapped in a nice pretty ribbon.  Loved the book!
B004LWZW42|5.0|Marvel has always done something different with their heroes. They don't all have great and fruitful lives as protectors of mankind. Spiderman had everyone against them powered by The Daily Bugle, Fantastic 4 were always arguing, Thor had his problems with family and girlfriends then there's The Hulk!!!<br />Xmen have this problem with mankind being suspicious of mutants, they don't seem to have the same degree of problems with the other guys but....anyway. What the heck.<br /> I have loved all the X-Men series, even 3 couldn't dampen my enthusiasm for the best group of super heroes ever, well..... until The Avengers came along.<br />As an origin story this is great fun, very exciting and with a clever bit of intertwining an existing piece of history, the Cuban missile crisis, with the story. I'm not going to mention special effects or direction. I can't be bothered. I just enjoyed it and felt emotions for the characters and their relationships as they went through the stresses caused by their opposing methods and opinions.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome!  A must read can't wait for the.movies:)  can't be soon enough for me,'this defiantly peaked my interest in my husband lol
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Have enjoyed this extremely well done series immensely! Great acting, interesting plot lines, like really following the family through the years.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I just got a Kindle and the first item I downloaded was Wonder Zoo! I immediately got hooked on it! I play this game daily. So much fun!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backpack for a trip to Mexico for a family wedding on the beach. One big concern was safely transporting my gear there and back (plane, taxi, ferry, Mexican customs, US customs, airport security, etc.)  I looked at several backpacks and chose this one based on the positive reviews and the price.  It was not an easy choice, mainly because this bag is not very attractive.  Other contenders (Tamrac, Lowepro, etc.) are much sexier, but at a higher cost.<br /><br />As many people here have testified, this is a very functional backpack.  I loaded it up with 2 DSLR's, 3 large lenses and tons of accessories.  Anything without it's own case, I wrapped in a microfiber cloth for additional protection.  I carried it on the plane and stowed it overhead for the flights.  It performed perfectly!  I didn't feel safe leaving my gear in the hotel, so I carried the backpack everywhere with no problems at all.  The waist strap is pretty silly and is positioned for either a small child or a large leprechaun.  Otherwise, for the price, this bag is great!<br /><br />The price for this bag tends to fluctuate from reasonable to ridiculously cheap!  It's been featured in Gold Box deals, so if you're patient, you can get it for a steal.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This movie definitely showed a different side to pilots that I wasn't aware existed.  Wasn't an uplifting movie but at the same time, was entertaining.  It came packaged appropriately without any issues.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|Good but not great movie. Totally predictable but still fun to watch...once. You won't find this a movie you keep going back to but watch it for what it is.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't wait to find out what happens, but now I miss the characters - which is always a sign of a good book.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I was surprised to re-read and read for the first time some of these stories. I have seen many played on the television. They are wonderful stories even after all these years and it's great to read the originals and see the author's vision.
0756990696|5.0|I first read Sophie's World in 1996. A friend suggested I read it. I bought a copy at Auckland Interntional Airport and took it with to New Caledonia. I could not put it down. I decided then I wanted to read all the philosophers covered and to teach philosophy, and I would even name my first daughter Sophie (actually I didn't). It is to me a book about the power and comfort of ideas and reason. It is also about how complicated notions can be communicated simply and clearly. It is a democratisation of philosophy in the same league as the Khan Academy.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Loved every second of it.. took my mind off some bad times I was having and focused on the book. Love super recommend!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game, never get bored of it, love the updates, fuunnnnnnnnnn and addicting, keep up the good work and thankkkkks for this game especially cause its freee, yaaay (:
0679809015|5.0|This is a terrific selection for a curious, learning to comunicate, baby.  He loves opening the flaps and trying to make the animal noises.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Not one of my favorite by Kate, but a good book.  It dragged a little, think it could have been a little shorter and it would have been a little better. A little Confusing, 100+ years in the book.  Hard to keep track of all the jumping from early 1900's to present day. Once you get to know the characters the confusion with the jumping subsides. Very dark book, sad, yet happy at the same time. Overall I would recommend it, but make sure you have a quiet place to read it.  I had to retread a few chapters, with so much detail and so many years to cover, if it was not quiet, I would get lost. That does not typically happen with me and books!
067144901X|4.0|My nine month old grandson is still a bit young for this book.  For him it's not quite interactive enough.  I suspect, as he matures, it will become a favorite.
B000H2GS6Q|5.0|i think every one must see this classic about clint eastwood in pail rider,it reminds me of my childhood and how a good classic western movie should be.....
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This was an excellent read.  Chris is a good story teller and a good writer.<br /><br />I really enjoyed everything about the book. The stats and background info was fascinating. Learning so much about ultra marathoning, some of its legends, and the Tarahumara was great.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever been any kind of runner or anyone who might want to be.
B000L212HC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that looks and sounds fantastic on blu ray. If you're into a really interesting story that keeps you guessing all the way through this is it. There's a couple of pretty cool extras too. This might be my favorite Nolan flick.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Unbelievable, lives up to the anime series and keeps all the important things we know and love intact. Highly recommended to any anime fan!
140120841X|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  Alan Moore creates a cinematic experience. This book will have you questioning your ideals. V for Vendetta is a better read then his other work Watchmen. The sketches on the back pages is a nice little bonus. The book is put together well.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|At first, I wasn't going to download it but I saw some positive reviews so I gave it a whirl. Let me say, the controls are a little confusing but it won't take you longer than 1 minute to figure it out. My first game got me so hooked, I actually ran late for work... opps. Love the game it is a great time killer. Also note, you should have a few games that you can play during the times you don't have internet service. I could have used this a week ago while in the dentist chair.<br /><br />Simple game, great quality, I will keep an eye out for this game developer.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Not a great case! There is a echo and no one can hear me. The case covers the camera too!
B006LSZECO|5.0|An excellent read, fast paced, exciting and well written.  Very interesting story.  I have recommended the book to friends and family.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is fantastic, my boys and I saw it in the theatre and loved it. As soon as Blu-ray came out we bought it and have seen it at least a dozen times. As for the disc itself picture and sound is excellent as any new Blu-ray should be. I haven't checked out any extras so I cannot comment on that.
B004W2V254|5.0|Great Survival story!!!<br />It's a miracle they both survive, no wonder nobody else has try to climb the mountain ever since!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I think that this is a very good app...I would like them to come out with more but I would still play this one the most be queen it is the best drawing app that anyone has ever createld ... please click like if you have enjoyed this post or just click picnic because u like the game...and if u just dont like the game at all then still click like because I want more reviwes..!!!!!<br />  Thank you....
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a quick but powerful read.  Well written and incredibly meaningful.  This book will make you stop and think about how to value the life you're living and the people in it.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game, I recommend people download it. It is really an marvel of action, exciting moves, boss battles and multiplayer. You can't beat that!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I have ever played on its like temple run but better run is awesome too but not as good as subway surfers!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is good( especially on big screen) but sometimes it keeps on running when you swipe to turn but other than that it is great.
B0000252YK|5.0|it`s a great album, and everything ozzy has made ,always the greatest heavy metal  singer. great price as well. looking forward to hes new stuff.
B00280LYIC|5.0|100000000% great!<br />Just loved it!<br />How about you should read it sometime. BUT IF YOU ALREADY READ IT, SPREAD the word!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I'm going to the dam snack bar
B000002IQW|4.0|I always wanted to own the skid row cd with the song get the f out on it, they did a great job in sending this.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Took a while to pick up but, got better... didn't think the ending flowed with the story line very well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the bomb it's even better than the first one if you download this you are making the right choice trust me
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really love this game but there is a lot of errors with the game itself.  For example, this game freezes sooooo much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game reinvented!!if you want action get subway surfers it's free and has lots of bonuses. Trust me, subway surfer is a game worth dying for......(:
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I can't reclaim my kindle from her until she's finished the entire book.... what more can i say.<br /><br />I rest my case. :)
184657918X|5.0|A bit about Terry Prachett's Discworld series, Diskworld, for those of you whom have not experianced it, is a vivid mix of Python, Tolkin, T Brookes, with some Shakespere, And even LeCarre thrown in. A rollicking fantastic oragy of Humanity, Dwarfs, Witch's, Wizzards, Troll's and other species co-existing on a flat world, Like a comic opera, staged on a old fashioned LP record album.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was an excellent seventh addition to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and kids will love it.
B000RJO578|5.0|The dynamic duo of Sean of the Dead is back in a fantastically funny movie.  Yes, like Sean of the Dead, the movie, and many of the images, are twisted and not for the young or faint of heart - but they are done with great effect, with humor, and in support of a very good story.  Great supporting cast too.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I can read this story a million times and it feels like New! I would love to see a movie.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|Maybe it was mocking american people - perhaps Simon Pegg just can't do that - but his characterizations and most of the movie is just - not funny.  Greatest sin of a comedy is being unfunny and mean.  I am a big fan of Hot Fuzz and Sean of the Dead - both of which are very funny because they retain just a bit of warmth.  This one is cold and silly in an unfunny way.  The treatment of american religion is grotesque.
1451638450|5.0|I have long been a fan of the Miles Vorkosigan series (or really, ANYthing by Bujold), and if you share that enthusiasm this is an easy book to recommend. I admit that I was a little unsure about a story about Miles' cousin Ivan -- I think it was all those books in which everyone referred to him as \\"Ivan, you idiot!\\" -- but Ivan turns out to be rather clever in his own right (\\"merely\\" in the 95th percentile of IQ, rather than Miles 99.999). And, I think, kind of a cutie.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to summarize a Bujold book without giving something away. This all starts when a friend in ImpSec (that's the spy organization) asks Ivan to check out a woman they have their eye on, and Byerly doesn't know or say much about her. She's gorgeous, so this isn't a hardship. But it doesn't take long for the mystery to change from \\"Who is this woman and why does anyone care?\\" to something else entirely, and I will NOT spoil your fun by telling you anything about it.<br /><br />Nominally you could read this book on its own, without having read any of the previous Vorkosigan novels, but I think you'd miss a lot of the historical references. I won't insist that you read all of them first, however. In fact, this book might be great if you read a few of the books and then sort of lost touch with Miles (or, as one friend did, lose interest in him), and you want something in the same universe but not Miles-dominated. ESPECIALLY if your favorites in the series were the books that were largely love stories, such as [[ASIN:0671877496 Cordelia's Honor]]. (Because I'm a fool for SF/F that's also romance.)<br /><br />The bottom line: I stayed up WAY past my bedtime reading this. It's great.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Yes, it is a zombie movie, twisted and graphic, and not for the young of faint of heart.  But it is extremely funny, very well executed, with high drama when warranted and funny when it needs to be.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It showed a different side of the the famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.  This told of his very controversial affair with Mayah Cheney from her point of view.  Even though he was a genius when it came to designing buildings, his personal life was filled with problems, not only with women, but also financial.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|addicting buttttt not my every day game its really fun wen it goes really fast oh and I'm just doing this for coins!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00499NHLC|4.0|Very nice retelling of the Sherlock Holmes story in a very up to date way. Can't wait for season 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game play's very well ! Great graffic's crazy fun! Only problem is that it studders on the kindal fire once in awhile. I still give it a five! !!
B0081336FO|4.0|Bad ass telling of the Doyle stories and it leaves you wanting more. Cant wait for season 3 but I will.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This app fun and great I like atom but I have to buy him so I play with anybody u create your own robot for 99&cent; but when you buy u get it forever
B008F5YDRI|5.0|The acting is amazing (every role, well cast) but beyond that is the story.  I prefer feeling happy at the end of my movies and this movie delivered that for me.  I am a fan of Ewan McGregor but I felt he never really made a movie where his fans could see him at his romantic best (even Moulin Rouge and Down With Love -- did not hit the mark for me).  Salmon Fishing in Yemen (despite the strange title), was wonderful, romantic, and worth seeing again and again.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I loved this book and all that was happening and I thought that Jonas bringing Gabriel was so nice but the sad part is that he can't return to the giver.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Without being a political treatise, Wool takes you into another world of a tightly controlled culture, yet one quite familiar. There's suspense, intrigue, betrayal, love, and mystery bundled into a tale that will hold you till the end. Just when you think you have it all figured out, you discover another layer that you did not anticipate. A fun read that will capture your imagination, and leave the door open for future novels. Give Hugh a try. You won't be sorry.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Definitely the best first kiss scene,  but it reminded me of all the jitters, butterflies and trembling of my youth. Delightful!<br />The book develop into a much deeper story filled with tradegy, true love, loss, an  of course, hope.
B0002JJBZE|3.0|I haven't watched the last disc yet, but the first disc had two badly scratched episodes. Most of the rest were fine, so it was well worth the price.
1401923127|4.0|This book was quite enjoyable, and I found it very refreshing to see a biological and scientific basis for what many new agers have been touting all these years. (that your thoughts have a profound impact on your reality) Although I've found those truths to feel right in my heart, reading that biological and scientific experiments have also discovered the same thing- was reassuring, and uplifting. His writing style was easy on the brain, and it was a relatively quick read, it doesn't tie you up for too long, yet it imparts some very titillating tidbits.<br /><br />I agree that the author kind of left us hanging about how to CHANGE negative thought patterns, and seeing the recommendation for the PSYCH-K method at the end was somewhat disappointing. (I hear about TRUE gurus who don't require payment for their services, and I wish I could stumble on one of them!) Lately, I've seen this PSYCH-K method, which is a 2 day workshop for @$450, the Transcendental Meditation thing, which is a whopping $1500 for the course, and Neale Donald Walsch's workshops, which are always few hundred bucks. Is writing a book just an overzealous advertisement for self-help service-sales in the future? Why can't anyone just write a book which helps you fix yourself, without the subsequent methods and workshops which cost a lot more $ and take up your time or require you to travel? People shouldn't HAVE to spend a bunch of $ to get info to improve themselves. That is just morally WRONG.<br /><br />Back to the book, I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in some of the pioneering discoveries in cell biology of late, and how they dovetail in with the New Spirituality which is becoming quite prevalent. It's a great addition!
B00AQ2KLEM|5.0|I have fallen deeply in love with this movie. Watched it 20+ times in the last two months. I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack and I'm glad to have it for the car but.......the CD is all studio versions of the songs, not the same as the ones used in the movie and not as good in my mind. Still, better than nothing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it!!...Watched the entire season in a weekend.....So thankful for Amazon Instant video....i got caught up just in time to see season 3...I am now a fan....
0670026603|5.0|This was a wonderful read and story.  Very thought provoking and it certainly stayed with me long after I finished.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like this game and the sounds are crazy. I will pass this on to the grandkids so they can enjoy it.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This seems like a great game that my kids really enjoy but in all reality you can only go so far before you either delete the game and forget it or spend a lot and I mean a lot of real cash to buy the rest of the available animals.  After drawing the line at the amount of real cash invested which didn't even scratch the surface of what would have to be spent to complete the game children are bored with it and ready to move on. So I believe to truly be a five star app you should have some type of conversion capability. Perhaps exchange in game earned cash for peanuts which would then keep people interested far beyond the standard animals you can earn in game.  At this point from what I can tell you have two options. 1. To aimlessly continue playing the game and even if you were awarded a peanut a day would take you literally decades to earn enough peanuts to acquire the animals left available.  Or 2. Let the kids spend approximately a grand or more of real cash to even attempt to enjoy the rest of the animals. I've even played the game a little and it does seem fun to run a zoo and capture and breed and search for different animals to add.  Kids always lit up when a new animal was rescued.  So don't get me wrong Gameloft did a great job on the game just seems they are maybe a tiny bit greedy. Obviously the aim of any service offered is profit but honestly it's a kids game I don't believe anyone would pay that much real cash for in game purchases.  And maybe I am possibly missing some available option to earn peanuts faster. If there is such a thing would someone be able to help me so I can enlighten my kids and keep them excited about the game they thoroughly enjoy.  Hopefully this is seen as an insightful review and not a rant. I just can't fork out the kind of cash my children keep asking for to stay interested in a game any longer. If all Gameloft games are like this I may have to steer clear of them so as not to eventually have to disappoint the kiddies.  Thanks.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It loaded at first try and worked as advertised. I'll be telling my daughter about it, I am sure she will use it.
B009HOU672|1.0|Most Amazon reviewers seem to like this recording. Different strokes for different folks. To me, listening to these interpretations of The Four Seasons felt like viewing a beautiful painting through a dirty window. To my ear, the arrangements added nothing of value to the originals and detracted considerably from their inherent beauty. Big thumbs down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this APP, I can track the weather at home and where the kids are before I go to visit them.
B008Y78M60|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic movie. I enjoy historical movies that make me question what I thought I knew. Definitely worth a watch.
0425263908|5.0|Similar to 50 shades, but liked this series better a lot better. I can't wait for the next book to arrive!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book!  Totally worth reading.  Although it doesnt seem like their will be a second book, somehow I hope there is a second book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the bomb!! I think this hake is for kids of all ages. this is what I think.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking for a case for their kindle. The fit is nice and snug so you don't have to worry about the kindle moving around and getting scratched up.Great Buy!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Its a good app, but it starts on phone start-up, and it runs in the background and you cant stop it. Other than that, its great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game<br /> it is fun to work hard to earn all the players and things I recommend that you get this game 5 stars
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book should be on anyone's reading list...as a matter of fact, i think it's required in most schools in the United States.
B00AOQ8MOQ|5.0|Well, see, he was nerdy. But in the end the cool kids learned to accept him. Because of the surfing.

B0002TJGQS|5.0|I chose these because they were the brand recommended by the maker of my garage door opener. Also, because the price was a very good deal, although I probably will never need all 5 of them, because this is the 1st time I've had to replace the battery in over 8 yrs. They were shipped out quickly and seem to be working just fine. I couldn't be any happier. Thank you!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|. CERTAINLY A THOUGHT PROVOKING MOVIE BUT  YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IF YOU MISSED IT.  AN EXCELLENT MOVIE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY.  IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE..
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Big Disappointment. Keira Knightley as Anna and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky had no chemistry together and \\"chewed up the scenery\\" throughout. The passion and obsession that these characters must have was \\"played at\\" and not believeably portrayed.  Ms. Knightley cried through her performance when she wasn't being plucky.  And Mr. Taylor-Johnson's work was as phoney as his mustache. His Vronsky seemed to be \\"charismatically challenged.\\"  Matthew Macfadyen is wonderful and savors every moment on screen. And Jude Law is perfect as the cuckolded husband.  The thematic concept of having the film use a theater as it's backdrop setting as a kind of \\"Life is a Stage\\" idea, didn't work for me.  I know it saved thousands of dollars in location shooting in Europe or Russia but it was more jarring than anything else and took me out of the moment, thinking how clever they were trying to be.  The costumes are stunning and certainly deserved an Oscar.  But overall, this movie is over-wrought.
B00838HRP2|1.0|The DVD was from the wrong region! So I couldn't watch the movie. I think the vendor should know where the product is going and if the product its going to be able to satisfy the necessities that the client is asking for.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|This was so boring but since I am a Harry Potter fan, I had to buy it and watch it.  It was like a camping trip.  Ugh.
B0081336FO|5.0|Do you like Sherlock Holmes? Then you'll love this. If the books were re-imagined today as a TV series, they might look like these episodes. Excellent.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|This was a must see versus Part I.  I always read the books and then watched the movie of the same title.

B006M9NJFG|3.0|Great canteens.. Hold more than the military version.. But not a fan at all of the cup... It is painted orange... Water has a funny tainted taste after boiling.. Also the heat &#34; resistant&#34; rubber coating for the handle melts easily...
1450419895|5.0|This is an excellent follow up to Delaviers Strength Training Anatomy I book. The two work well as a team each supporting the other. I particularly like the additional research and commentary the author provides regarding the science of strength training. The bottom line is it is a worthy addition to this author’s library. My only complaint, which is very minor, is I believe it is geared more for body building or sports specific lifting rather than powerlifting which is my focus.  Other than that I go back and review it regularly to make sure my training is not neglecting any other muscle groups. Balance is good.
B00486070K|5.0|Excellent as described. Hooked up to my Mac Mini and entered my network information. Worked instantly without any problems. Mac OS recognized.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Wonderful DVD on the life of Beatrix Potter. When compared to Wikipedia, it is a very true rendition, very accurate.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Not just for teenagers, but anyone who loves true blood or anything of that nature. Can't wait to read book 3!
630562285X|5.0|Sean Connery and Katherine Zeta-Jones at their finest in this DVD.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat, which makes this pure enjoyment!
B0000DIXLM|2.0|I love the album but one disc skips through half the songs. One discs works perfect, but it is disappointing to have one damaged.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|The movie Gran Torino was a recommendation from friends.  We are glad we purchased the DVD because it truly is a good story line, and Clint Eastwood is fantastic in this story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome! very good resolution, better than iPad,I bought it for my daughter<br />and I'm using it . it is excellent.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|It took me a long time to finally get around to watch this movie. I lost a dog to cancer the year prior, and I still haven't gotten over her loss. I feared this movie would make me cry, but I didn't think it would make me cry that much! Granted, a bit of wine...alright, a lot of wine may have uninhibited my emotions; however, this movie left me with a sense of serenity and gratuity for being lucky enough to have had a wonderful relationship with a canine companion for as long as I did.<br /><br />If you are suffering from dog obsession (like I do), then this film is an absolute must see.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The Mark of Athena continues the series following the action of our heroes Percy and Jason. It really brings in the mythology about the Romans while continuing to cover the familiar Greek. I didn't quite enjoy it as much as it's predecessors though. It had quite a few slow parts, the gods are a bit missing in action for the most part (though I guess that is part of the plot), the action of the Romans makes little sense (rather than trying to save the world they would rather work on revenging a grudge), and I found the humor to be a bit more over the top than the previous books. The book was also quite long, but I guess that means I got my money's worth. The ending didn't bother me as I think it is a great setup for the next novel, and as always it covers a huge amount of myth and various deities. All-in-all it kept me entertained and I look forward to the next novel (House of Hades) to see how our heroes end up.
B0031SCV46|3.0|i cant play it without my computer.  i thought i could just play it whenever, but i cant.  u better download fl studio or something: music producing software
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Horrible.  The only good thing I can say about this rendition of Conan is it makes the old 1980'a Arnold Schwarzenegger Conan's look like master pieces.  Have any of these writers, directors, etc. actually read the Robert E Howard books?  Pretty boy Conan falling in love with pretty girl?  Since when is Conan a love story?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of most addicting apps out there!! I can hardly stop playing it. I would recommend this app for all ages. My 4-year-old granddaughter loves it!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I purchased a pair of these headphones on Black Friday, primarily to use for online gaming.  Initially, the idea sounded great - No cords, simply flip-up boom mic, etc.<br /><br />When I got them, I was initially very happy - They seemed to do everything that I hoped they would with a few minor annoyances.<br /><br />As I've kept using them and the glamour has faded, I'm realizing that those minor annoyances have become much more of a pain and it's not really worth putting up with the hassles anymore.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The battery life is pretty decent - It seems like I was getting 5-6 hours of play time out of them on wireless<br />The sound is quite good - I was quite happy with how they sounded and had no problems with clarity, etc.  Maybe not quite as clear as I had hoped, but OK.<br />The range is exceptional - I could almost walk to the other end of our (large-ish) house and they kept working.<br />The G keys are very handy for listening to music - Being able to easily move between songs is quite nice, especially shuffling through a large music library.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Weight.  These things are very, very heavy and you feel it bearing down.<br />These 'phones are also very large - My kids can't use them at all.  If you have a small head, look elsewhere.<br />Reliability is poor - It seems like they often flake out on me - Sound goes away, they start to squeal loudly in my ears, etc.  This happens when wireless or plugged in.  Powering them off and back on usually works, but sometimes I have to hold the power button down to \\"reset\\" them.  (And, I'm like 2' from the transmitter with clear line-of-sight, so there isn't any interference)<br />The G-Key volume control works very sporattically - Not a biggie for me since I use a Logitech keyboard (which I LOVE!) and use it's volume controls.<br />When plugged in, the micro-USB plug on the supplied cord seems like it's very invasive and isn't placed well.  It gets in the way and feels like it makes the cord hang strangely.<br />Lack of an effective auto off - It seems that if I leave the headphones unplugged but turned on they will drain the battery down to nothing and die.  It's a hassle to have to to continually plug them in when I'm done.  It almost feels like I spend so much time plugging and unplugging that it's not worth it.<br /><br />All in all, not my best Black Friday purchase.  I've finally just switched back to my [[ASIN:B002DS4HTM Creative HS-800 Fatal1ty Gaming Headset]] that I've used for many years.  Sure, it doesn't have the convenience of wireless or G Keys, but they are comfortable, light, sound great and...  well..  Work!
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|very use full i love it everything fits correctly it don't get in the way easy to get in and out and comfort
0765325950|5.0|I have read all 14 books in the series and enjoyed them all. Hate to see the saga end. Robert Jordan was a gifted story teller.
B009ERK1T0|3.0|I grew up in Sacramento, California and remember seeing Deftones shows for $3.  Loved every one of their tapes and cds so far.  With that being said, I don't dislike this cd, but I think it's rather average and boring.  Without Chi Cheng, the Deftones are lacking something... their best albums were all with Chi.  The Deftones have become a one trick pony at this point playing their Morrissey/Cure impersonations while attempting a bit heavy rhythms.  I will always love Deftones, but if you go back and look at Adrenaline (1995) compared to Around the Fur (1997), two completely different albums.  Between Around the Fur (1997) and White Pony (2000), once again, different albums.  Koi No Yokan and Diamond Eyes sound so similar that you could barely tell them apart.  Deftones are THE band for the hipsters who pretend they are too cool for mainstream rock, but too lame to search for more underground or newer bands.  While this album is still better than most, it is sub standard work for Deftones and it is painfully obvious they are in artistic decline.  Pretty disappointing to be honest.  Mediocrity at its finest.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love having this app and love the new purple colors and displays!!!!  Love it on my galaxy 3 phone. Great
B0093URN4E|5.0|Jane Doe (2001) is arguably Converge's best album.  They have put out quite a few good albums since, but none is as good as this.  From beginning to end, every type of metal style is displayed.  Is it hardcore? Yes.  Is it Metalcore? Yes.  Its not easily defined into one category.  This album proves that Converge are still a force to be reckoned with and can still produce music of this caliber this late into their career.  If only Megadeth and Metallica could pull off what Converge does, the world would be a better place.  A masterpiece of sound.  Could go down as Converge's best album, and that's saying a lot!  Still one of the better metal bands in the world.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app it is great if you don't have a clock (which I don't) so I would reccomend this app to everyone!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very good. Few glitches and some unresponsive swipes though. Don't buy coins, you can get them easier and for free in the game. Still very fun and good graphics :D
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I found this game to be very addictive, and is great if you love animals. There are loads of different animals and can crossbreed animals to create very rare animals
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Lotsa fun and a real challenge on the higher levels to score big. Anyone who whines about this app needs to learn how to match items that look alike.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Sweet and awesome or swasome<br />It is ridiculous how many people have played that game<br />It is 'really fun as well
B00A757EFW|2.0|Doesn't work so well using a touchscreen. The App is fine but playing it on kindle fire HD just isn't working out too well.<br />I'll have to let the real pac-ers play this one. Those ghosts are too fast for me.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The perfect amount of challenging! Great story,  graphics and intrigue! It give you more bang for your buck. Really enjoyed this and cant wait for part 2!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|It's not an easy game to play but it sure is fun trying to get through the levels!<br />Keep trying and eventually you'll get the hang of it and remember..a light touch goes a long way!<br />Relaxing music and great graphics!
B001VW9SH2|5.0|love this song...has been a favorite since I first heard it.  Not usually a big fan of this group, but just love the beat and rhythm of this one.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Love this app. Wish I could play a piano better, but this app is a lotta fun and the sound is super.<br />Sounds just like a piano! Oh my! It is a piano and I can play Bach without all those expensive lessons!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love the new Batman movies. The Dark Knight is still my favorite, but TDKR is definitely up there on my list of faves.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I liked this one sooo much I just had to buy the paid version. Both versions works great on kindle fire HD.<br />One day in the distant future I will be playing on expert level!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|always love stephen king. this book did not disappoint me although in some chapters in dragged along somewhat. interesting topic revisited after so long
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love, love, love this series! Watched all three seasons within a few weeks and can not wait for season four!
B0060AY6FO|5.0|This is the first sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I have enjoyed! P.D. James has the talent and love of Austen that are prerequisite to writing about Elizabeth and Darcy. The book is captivating and the mystery and its twists kept me guessing. She even includes several characters from other Austen novels. Delightful! I recommend it to all fans of Jane Austen's novels!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is loads of fun; it is a bit addictive though.  I've already wasted an entire evening playing.  It's quite relaxing...so buy it and enjoy.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Despite it usually being panned I enjoyed it.  The story was a bit weak, but the alien ships were awesome--altho somewhat like transformers.  And I like the way the aliens got their but kicked.
B006MGDVIY|5.0|I followed Ayrton's career since the beginning, he's my favorite driver.<br />Simply amazing, not without faults like all of us but inside an F1 car no one will come close.  Some of his qualifying runs and especially wet races were beyond belief.  I must admit, I'm a biased fan of Ayrton as a driver and human being and I enjoyed the documentary immensely, but you need not be a fan to appreciate the insights and politics of F1 racing presented in the movie, during his time.  His expressed contempt of Balestre, the F1 chief at the time,  the suspicions he had that the Benetton team was cheating and other relevant events are covered.<br /><br />Not a lot of racing footage, but instead we get to see the man, not solely the driver.  I really liked it when we were taken back to his karting days and we also got to see him relax with family and friends.<br /><br />If you're a fan, much of what is shown in the movie you already know but it's super nice to have it presented all in one shot in chronological order.  For those of you with a passing interest:  watch the movie, you'll not waist your time, it's a great account of Ayrton's short but truly remarkable life.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|I down loaded this app out of curiosity more than anything. Not my cup of tea. I'm not much of a game player.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This was like... every kid's dream back in the days. The screen supports a full 1080p resolution, all current-gen consoles fit perfectly and the hard exterior protects everything properly. The screen alone costs more separately, so this is a great deal.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I have tried many of these types of games and did not disappoint ..I will continue to purchase these games from G5
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book pulled every emotion out of me and in a beautiful and gentle way. I am so not into high school romances (I prefer alpha male, erotica, etc.) but the overwhelming positive reviews of this book convinced me to try it. It was an absolute STEAL for $3.99. This was one of those books that would have been worth much much more...<br /><br />To start off, you know something isn't quite right with Sky by how she interacts with a guy in the first chapter. As you read through the chapters, more and more of Sky is revealed, but you still can't figure out what her deal is. When Holder enters the picture, it's a very believable start to a typical teenage romance...until the romance causes memories to begin surfacing.<br /><br />This book is about so much more than romance. It is about everything wrong with the world today---and everything that is right. The twists and turns keep you guessing as to what happened to Sky and the writing is absolutely incredible. I was caught up immediately in the story and literally laughed, cried, and sighed many times throughout the book. It was truly an emotional roller coaster and I finished the book with a smile on my face but still shocked by what had taken place and the truths that were revealed.<br /><br />This was a very well written, clever and beautiful story. Don't miss it--believe the positive reviews. Again, one of the absolute best books I have read in a long time. Well done, Colleen Hoover!  :)
B005K17RU0|1.0|While the information in the app is clear and accurate, it never stops running and drains the battery really quickly. About and hour after installing it, my battery went from 75% to 30%. Not really recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game superpowers and more traffic is tough but fun I want more challenges like the Easter egg hunt. Damien Danger Weller,
B000UE29SW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down once I started reading. Makes me want to live life to the fullest in every way possible!
B009POHHR6|5.0|This was an incredibly interesting take on the \\"what if?\\" of the Superman mythos. I was quite happy with the portrayal of Superman and everyone that he knew in this bizarre situation.
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|However, I was listening to it in my car, and got in an accident. The tow company still has it.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I've been dying to see this since I heard about it on NPR. Then after seeing the trailer and giggling like an idiot I couldn't wait to rent this film. This could easily have been a drama given the subject matter. But I loved the characters positive approach to his \\"challenges\\" he is brilliant with a quick wit and romantic flair. William H. Macy is hilarious as the cool Catholic priest. It's nice to see Hellen Hunt. I loved her in As Good As it Gets. And I've missed her on the big screen. She doesn't disappoint. Give it a watch. Laugh a little. Maybe cry a little too ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great for passing the time and keeping busy. Great buy! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B00999CZKG|4.0|Good fun! The boys celebrate their career. Very good efforts by the band re-creating their legacy. Well filmed. Good sound.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|Excellent material. The new discs are well worth the maoney, The legend in his prime and before. The early concert has great moments that can't be missed.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|All of Dickens books are 5 star and the supplier of this k version good job. I have downloaded the complete works of Dickens, my favorite author.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I really like action movies and this one had promise. The special effects were fairly good. The half naked bare breasted woman with not two, but three bare nipples showing all, was stupid. Definitely not family friendly and it seems that some movie makers believe that the general public actually find that a few hundred swear words in a movie must make it more stimulating. Funny how some of the most successful movies of all time didn't have to use any foul language. I will not watch this move again. Ever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Quick, easy, great game to play in lines and offices while waiting. No glitches that I've come across. Fast. Fun.
B00BBI9WD6|3.0|More war strategy than I like but still a good story.  It was also a very technical story, alot went over my head.

B00026ZG10|5.0|A classic Arnold movie that focuses on the ability of a housewife's ability to succeed in a male-dominated spy environment
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must confess that I saw all of the five star reviews and was intrigued.  However the subject of being confined in a silo gave me pause.  Made me think that the books would be too confining, too interior.  Let me say that this is throughly detailed and wonderful story.  Very dark, very subtle.  The Wool series are a fast read.  Stick with the First Shift of the Silo Series as the subject and tone changes.  However, everything ties together in the end.  It is well worth it.
1843793792|5.0|Having read and listened to a number of Georgette Heyer books, all in a row, now, I am happy to report that this abridged version of Venetia does very well in the capable hands of Naxos and in the excellent reading by Richard Armitage. The editing didn't take away from the charming story, Naxos used very tasteful musical interludes, and who, I ask you, could resist listening to that deep, sensual voice of heart-throb Armitage? What is not to like? Only problem I had was I kept visualizing Armitage (who does a superior job with all the characters) as the very desirable rake Lord Damerel, and wishing somehow that this was a movie. Armitage's agent has simply got to get him into more romantic roles--he would have been great in Jane Eyre or Pride & Prejudice, or another other brooding leading man role. Meanwhile, I'll rush out for the other Heyer audio book he's done. I think these are great books for audio production. Heyer was incredibly prolific, and the fact that every public library has dozens of her books circulating very nicely after all these years is a testament to this pedestrian housewife's talent for producing a good read. Naxos does an excellent job in translating the novel to audio. More please.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|First a word of warning for the faint of heart, or casual reader: This is a well-crafted work of literature.  It makes excellent and proper use of language. If you have never read a great work of literature you may feel overwhelmed. This is to be expected. What you should do, in this case, is sit back and let the story educate and enlighten your mind as well as entertain and enthrall your spirit.<br /><br />That said… Wow! I’m personally used to reading and writing books that are a bit grittier and dirtier in language/tone/subject matter than this. This is not a bubble gum read. The word choice and sentence structure used is truly inspired, and shows artistry that is lost to more than 90% of writers today, I'd wager. I was barely into this book and I felt that I was reading a work that had been published out of its era, as though it were a classic work, only discovered and released in the modern age. I would have believed this book was written in the time it was set in.<br /><br />As always, I will give no spoilers in a review, but I will speak to what you can expect from the work as a whole. The tale is set in 1930’s Europe, and shows us the lives, loves, fear, passions, and prejudices that effected and informed the lives of peoples who were impacted so greatly by Nazi Germany. Jew and Catholic alike, even Lutheran, no one was immune to the social implications of policies gaining traction at that time.<br /><br />The themes the author chose to addressed, from classism and anti-Semitism to religious bias, mental illness, and sexual orientation, were all well presented in plot, and nothing felt forced or even slightly out of place. I was, and still am amazed at the quality of craftsmanship shown in the storytelling.<br /><br />I started reading this book with expectations, based on its subject matter and the time period it as set in. Those expectations were shattered.<br /><br />I expected a work of fiction. This was a work of art.
B0027MJU00|2.0|This violence in this book was disturbing, and the characters were not likeable. At least it was a quick read.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it and can't wait for the last book to see what happens next with Eva and Gideon. Sigh. I simply adore them together and have to admit that I'm quite smitten with their relationship.<br /><br />Anyway, this book was the perfect continuation of Bared to you and I can't seem to find the words to describe how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Read it.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is the best sudoku app I'v ever used. The entry method is customizable &amp; it lets you enter all your possible numbers in each box. One tiny feature that made it the best in my opinion, was that when you enter a number in a box, it erases that number from any possibles you might have entered in its line, row &amp; box. Most other apps leave it up to you to go through &amp; erase those, which is time consuming &amp; annoying. Most every feature is customizable &amp; I think that one might be too, if you don't want it to do that. I also like that there are levels for each difficulty level. So it can be like your own personal tournament if you want. Which can give you a nice feeling of accomplishment. I'm keeping this one &amp; deleting my other sudoku app, its a good one, but this one is the best. I highly recommend this app to sudoku lovers. Just try it &amp; you'll see. I feel so lucky to get it for free.
B003O86FMW|5.0|and I think the book is better then the movie<br />and I do not want it to end never but I am so happy
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Very good to get this box set at the price - really good deal for blu-rays of a great TV series
044980691X|5.0|Interesting characters.  A couple of nice twists to the story.  Excellent writing.  Grisham is one of my favorite authors.  I recommend this book, either in audio or written.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|That was a fun read!  Should be made into a movie!!  Thanks Andy for a awesome break from the grind!!!
1400069289|5.0|This was a suggested read by my EVP and I found it very interesting.  In fact, I sat down and read it in a single day.  Anyone who is in sales or customer service will appreciate this book.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I decided to buy the trilogy after watching the movie and, as any reader will attest, the book far exceeds the film. I love the characters, am zipping through and finding it hard to put down... you know, to eat, work, go to sleep!
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|The OSX driver is kind of stupid-- it puts an extra icon in my menubar that gives me the option to power down the card while it's plugged in. Pretty much a waste of screen real estate.<br /><br />Also, I sometimes have to eject and re-insert the card reader itself before it recognizes an SD card.
B0053O89JM|4.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas in addition to the other seasons.  She has enjoyed watching them.  Very good price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game i have ever played i am addicted and got all my friends playing! The idea of going all around the world is really good and it keeps me wanting to keep playing.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Have to be honest... love this game but it crashes a lot, freezes up and now wont let me get into the game. Whenever I try to log into my Facebook account it force closes on me. I'm on level 23 and just breed a sun dragon.... so very disappointing!!!!!!!!!
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|El producto llegó en perfectas condiciones, y funciona muy bien, muy buen servicio. El envio demoró solamente 3 días y sin ningún inconveniente.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it this is a nice fun app do play with when there is nothing else to do but there could be a few more changes
030758836X|3.0|Ok, technically, I shouldn't write a review, as I didn't get through the full book. There are 8000+ reviews here---mostly favorable--- but I just couldn't get into this one. I made it about half-way through, and though the underlying story is intriguing, these characters didn't give me much to hold onto.<br /><br />The writing style in the book is interesting, as the author goes back and forth between past and present. I assume that in the end, the two story lines meet. The characters aren't particularly likable, but the author's approach does provide a window into how one relationship began and then seemingly disintegrated. The contrast between male and female perspectives on relationships was also illuminated (I didn't count, but I wonder what the gender breakdown is between those who five-starred the book versus those who did not).<br /><br />With the number of positive reviews this book has, I wouldn't discourage you from reading it. I am obviously in the minority opinion here. I just wish the book would have had more 'pull' than I found to be true.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|totally amazing<br />you guys rock. who ever invented this game is the best person in the whole wide world boo yah
B00AGE20ZI|4.0|It is a good movie. It is worth a watch. The streaming was fine. Overall this was a good viewing experience.
B0001I561E|1.0|Received the Aladdin DVD in the mail today. Not only was there a huge scratch, but we have reason to believe it is fake as well. The writing on the Disc 1 portion has a few typos, adding to the fact that it looks like someone slapped a DVD label made from a home label maker on there. Very disappointed. Called Amazon and will be receiving my money back!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Good book.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.  It contained a lot of interesting things about German WWII fighter pilots, their planes, and their misgivings about the Nazis.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so fun!<br />I would have to say this is one of the best game in the world!!!!!
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle's story is REMARKABLE! I'm an avid reader, and I must say this is by far one of my favorite books. I could not put it down and finished the entire book in just short of five days!<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|I really like Brandon Sanderson, so I purchased this short novel.  It was not my favorite Sanderson book, but it was still very interesting and I was not sorry I took the time to read the book.
B004DH8IK0|3.0|This is a third tier album for me having already obtained most of the first and second tier music I like.<br />I bought this album for one track, but I knew that fact going into it.<br />I'm trying to complete my physical collection before hard copies disappear.<br />I suspect the &#34;cloud&#34; will become a spotty access, virtual pay as you go nightmare.<br />There are a few other tracks that are ear-worthy on this album.<br />Certainly not for everybody.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I was not familiar with the Lumineers before buying the album, but I enjoyed the whole album.  I look forward to hearing more.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|As usual this was a good ride with Harry Bosch.  I love this character and have read all the books in order.  This book has a great twist.  Rachel and the FBI, two of Harry's favorite bug-a-boos!!  Enjoy!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Overall a good remaster of a classic. Much better than the 2004 reissue. Sounds crisper.<br />The live CD is a good addition if you are a Megadeath fan.<br />Packaging cool. Poster sweet. Good booklet with extra pics from the era.<br />Postcards o.k. but not anything special.<br /><br />Good price for a classic album. Dave is one angry redhead.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a Pinterest addict, the app is perfect for me. I wanted the app for use with my tablet. I love it!
B007PVHANM|4.0|There are still massive holes in the story that could have been better addressed and I got the impression that the maker inherited this project instead of actually wanting to do it from the beginning. I was however pleased with many new interviews and titbits of info and don`t feel I wasted my time or money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This sci-fi apocalyptic teen book pulled no punches about how happy endings aren't that happy. Scars are left but we carry on. It had an honest yet hopeful conclusion.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|Great book! Love reading her books. The book was a fast read and had a perfect mixture of laugher and adventure. Look forward to many more to come.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Very well written.  Keeps you interested all the way through.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  Don't let the size of the book deter you.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|He has the right type of ego with a go for it attitude, he does a great job of illustrating some very effective techniques that can be used to propagate success.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game is very fun when u first get it. After a few minutes you lose interest and is an okay time filler for road trips
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I have watched the sherlock holmes movies and tv shows so I order the books and I cant put it down. it great reading and it vary cool how the tv show of sherlock holmes fallow parts of the books. am glad I bought the books and I be reading them over again
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is a good time filler and I recommend it for children during a car trip to pass time
B00846REIS|4.0|Bared To You is a well-written erotic novel with well-developed characters.  It is a bit too similar to the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, but the plight of the characters is more interesting  and provacative.  Some situations are a bit pornograhic in nature, but the insatiable, obsessive passion is a real turn-on!.  Can't wait to read the continuation novel, Reflected In You!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. If u don't get it u r stupid. U travel the world in one cool game. U see and play in different cities about every month
0316228532|3.0|I was eager to read this book because Ms. Rowling is one of my favorite authors.  The first half of the story is very well written but there are a lot of characters to keep track of.  Unfortunately  I found myself skimming through the second half.  The central conflict was not dire enough to make me really care for the characters plight.  I do however enjoy her style and hope her next adult fiction book simply has a more interesting premise.
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|Really different.  Kind of Louisiana bluesy.  We both like it!  I would recommend it.  His voice really gets to you.
B004LWZWBU|3.0|I expected more photography of birds, birdwatching, and information on birds.  The names of birds is said so quickly I couldn't understand some of the names.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Came up as a free app of the day so I tried it out, I was not a fan of the angry birds knock-off with its lag and lack of creativity and deleted it immediately.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very cool game. It has everything I like in mystery games.  I'm really enjoying the game. The best part is the graphics. Excellent work. Looking forward to the  second part of game.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The app works great for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch. I use it in class. Would not be as good without a keyboard, though, so keep that in mind. I am using a Belkin bluetooth keyboard. All of the keyboard shortcuts from MS Office seem to work, too.
B00002DF4X|5.0|I enjoy all of these soundtrack songs for this  CD. I think ordering either the Julia Roberts Collection or the Trevor Jones collection you'll find very good and appealing. I did.
0783231032|5.0|This is a classic movie. Love Candy, Belushi & Ackroyd. I was 10 when this movie came out and remember enjoyning it then.
B000002H2Z|4.0|Unless you an were old enough (and a savvy enough) music afficionado, most fans of The Cure were introduced to the band well after their seminal, post-punk offerings on 'Boys Don't Cry' or 'Three Imaginary Boys'. Be it before or after the alt-rock explosion of the early 90's, it was more likely than not that, after discovering Goth's High Priest, there was an impressive back catalog of makeup and mope to explore.  From there, countless members of my generation began spending their hard earned fast food employee money and fell in love with at least one era of Robert's music, if not all of them.  One of the great joys of my adolescence was going to the local record store and digging through the used CD bin, hopeful that someone had discarded some ill-appreciated gem which would be added in alphabetical order to my woefully inadequate collection of the obscure.<br /><br />Such was the case with The Head On The Door.  For $7.99 plus applicable sales tax I acquired what would ultimately be regarded as a bit of doom-pop bliss; an album of uneasy tranquility that discourages joy with oppressive lyrics as it positively bleeds exhuberance. The radio ready \\"Inbetween Days\\" and \\"Close To Me\\", the later with its ridiculously engaging vocal melody in which Robert fools us into smiling as we sing along to: \\"But if I had your faith/Then I could make it safe and clean.  If only I was sure/That my head on the door was a dream\\", can be glossed over and misunderstood by the casual listener as little more than left-of-center pop tunes. But 'Push', a decidedly deep Cure track, is positively sinister in its ability to hook the listener with a triumphant, chiming guitar intro that hides a short, unnerving lyric about things better left unsaid.<br /><br />There is an uneven quality to this record that separates it from the other pre-Wish Cure albums.  In so far as the album opens with 'Inbetween Days', one of Robert's best un-pop songs, and closes with a precursor to Disintegration with the dreary, if not quite fully fleshed out 'Sinking', The Head On The Door comes across like a clash between Smith, the undisputed father of Goth, struggling with his inner Michael Jackson.  Of course there were earlier examples of Smith's pop sensibilities:  'Let's Go to Bed' and 'Caterpillar' come to mind.  Heck, Robert loved the title track from 'Boys Don't Cry' so much that he dressed it up and re-released it for a video seven years after the album's debut.  But the dreary 'Seventeen Seconds' or the absolutely vacant feel of 'Faith' are being drowned out by a happier (?) Smith who so clearly wanted to express an emotion other than misery.  The bounding, playful 'Six Different Ways' opens with: \\"This is stranger than I thought/Six different ways inside my heart\\"; not the words of a man lost in self-loathing at all. 'Kiss Me' would see a return of sorts of Robert's pop sensibilities and would arguably mark the last time he wrote a joyful song worth listening to.<br /><br />And so The Head On The Door gets to be the middle child, I suppose; an album that is a little bit of everything... except itself.  Head On The Door touches briefly on the goth of old on 'Kyoto Song' and 'Screw'; executes brilliantly pop with depth and death on both 'Push' and 'Close To Me'; and foreshadows by several years the ode to disconnect that would be Disintegration with 'Sinking'.  That being said, I've found this to be one of the easiest Cure records on the ears and an album so infused with Robert's singular understanding of pop as a platform for grief that repeat listens only serve to engage the listener in new, deceptively dark ways. Though not as catatonic as 'Faith', as expansive as 'Kiss Me' or as flawless as 'Disintegration', The Head On The Door is a richly rewarding listening experience.  Enjoy without caution.e dreary, if not quite fully fleshed out 'Sinking', The Head On The Door comes across like a clash between Smith, the undisputed father of Goth, struggling with his inner Michael Jackson.

B001L51RQE|4.0|At first I thought I would be slightly disappointed with this live version of The Police music since I was such a huge fan of Synchronicity Live in the 80's. I enjoyed the accompanying DVD as much as the concert. It really gives us an inside look of how real these guys are. Sure they are rock stars but they are perfectly normal people too.  Sometimes, it is hard to think of them from that perspective.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|My family was so excited when Season 2 arrived in our mailbox, but we were so disappointed when Castellano wasn't offered as a language option like the 1st season was! We are from Spain, and Castellano is the kind of Spanish spoken there, and it's very different than the Spanish spoken in Latin America! It doesn't sound as smooth or fluent as Castellano! I hope they'll add Castellano again to the 3rd season when it comes out on DVD!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I absolutely LUV this game ALOT!!!! Awesomest game ever only I had to delete it then I had to reload it but other than that it is great! &lt;3
0765325950|4.0|It has been a 24 year wait for this series to finally conclude but it has set the standard that others (Game of Thrones) will be measured by.  Brandon Sanderson has done a masterful job completing the series.
0312330863|5.0|Was recommended to me by a friend.  After reaidng, I gave it to a teenager who wants to be a vet when she grows up.  She loved it, too.  Great story !
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play survival and have iron and diamonds.My house is big but have armour or you might die when you hunt monsters
B000003CMC|5.0|I see that some of the average/negative reviews had to do with the 33 minute Mountain Jam .<br />It is understandable that some may not like it but to me it is like a great symphony . Very very moving .<br /><br />Particularly during a long drive or flight --fire up the Mountain jam and the next 33 minutes are taken care of .<br />After Berry takes over behind the drum solo and Duane or Gregg counts it off (at around 22:02) one, two, three, four and the rest of the band comes in returning to the theme --WOW -- goosebumps ---what a great band!<br /><br />And unfortunately as one rock reviewer said Duane's memorable sign-off --Berry Oakley, Dickey Betts, Butch Trucks , Jai Johnny Johnson, Gregg Allman and I'm Duane Allman  Thank you -- was like he was walking off his last stage forever.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is such a great author. I enjoy all this books.  This one I didn't want to put down.  Great read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed is a great game for adults and kids. I absolutely love this game. Easy to play. Great the way they go to different locations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game. You can do many things. Go on Facebook, get new boards, and new character
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series so far exceeds my descriptive ability that let me suffice it to say that I have not enjoyed a program this  well in thirty years.  I am not one who can normally watch a program more than once.  This series is part of my routine!.  Tremendous!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and so cool by the way I'm a black boy<br />Who loves this game so I can write as munch as I want so I shouldn't rate this game so I can write something that is awesome and so I can see u doin the American Dragon Jake long
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a blast!!! It's a lot more fun in my opinion than the Temple Run series. Running from the cops and collecting coins while jumping ducking and dodging trains and other obstacles. I also am amused at the gameplay when you hit an oncoming train. hahaha.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i liked BR and all the bonus material, videos...etc.etc.etc. :)<br />Spoofs were excellent, i enjoyed them solo much! lot of fun if u get this !!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My daughter is a big fan of My Little Pony so I got this app for her to play on the Kindle Fire and she loves it.... HOWEVER Learn from me! Disable one click purchases or wifi on your Kindle Fire if you let your kid play because it is very easy to buy gems and coins from Amazon on this game! I learned that the hard way when my email displayed the 3 orders I didn't know I placed on Amazon.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing. So heart felt and touching.<br />It's that kind of story where it's sad but so good at the same time.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|First let me say that I really enjoy the 007 series. I remember growing up and seeing Roger Moore as 007. Ever since I've been a fan. I wasn't impressed w/ Pierce Brosnan or Timothy Dalton as Bond, but I do like Daniel Craig. Skyfall is a great continuation of the 007 series and would recommend it to any 007 fans or those interested in a good entertaining movie.
1572816295|5.0|I adore these Tarot cards, they are my favorite ones and really the only ones i ever chose to use now.  the illustrations are beautiful and full of meaning and life.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun for everyone in the family from me and my wife down to my 2 year old. We love this game and enjoy slicing and dicing away!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game. So much fun to play. Love the horses and cleaning them and caring for them and brushing them.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|I love her voice and lyrics. It did take a while to ease into the songs on the album, however, it's a keeper!
0393327345|1.0|The &#34;person&#34; whose name appears on the cover, if it exists,  cannot write, which I always for some elitist reason find, should make individual & publisher shut up.But neither can B. E. Ellis, & look at what a role model dandy-dude we have! Plagiarism (BEE), men without a life (CP AND BEE) writing, dear readers, with the cynical detachment of the self-righteous psychopath. From both we get not fiction, not literature (sorry, style is appropriate, goodbye post-nihilism) but painfully tedious mind-porn, because there is no life of the mind here! This is what REALLY is going on, personally I do not find it funny, edifying, inspiring, OK, I couldn't go through all the pages because I don't have the time to waste, I do write as well. Whoever should read a bit.
B008Y73940|3.0|Not a bad movie, but not one of my favorites; moved a little slow for me, although I did enjoy the ending!
0800141660|5.0|Book was a gift for family in USA so have no idea how it was received or even if it was received.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Loved this movie -- especially the little scout -- laughed out loud so many times at the theatre I bought this for my grandkids.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|This movie may or may not be based on at least some truth--I don't really know,but Damon,Tutoro and Dinero are all top notch actors with a good script to work from and give great performances. Redmayne's is good too.His portrayal of a naive agent with poor judgement who almost marries a Soviet agent is plausible. This is a well crafted movie and I recommend it.
B005D6O0IY|5.0|nice and comfortable without losing a youthful and contemporary, is really a character and personality shoes very properly recommend, you can go to the beach or just walking casually with them.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|This movie is for grown ups who are still kids who watched the original Star Trek series. Everybody who's in it is good. If your an adult but still a kid you'll enjoy this movie.
B00322PK2G|5.0|excellent experience with these watches swatch, comfortable and pretty good machines, with contemporary and youthful appearance, recommended for all ages of girls
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|This kid reminds me of my son Luke.  It is just a \\"make you smile\\", movie that most parents can relate to if they have children in Middle School or have experienced that segment of your child's life.  Love the entire series of three movies and they could not have casted a better group of actors.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|After hearing everyone from my parents to friends rave about the show, I finally gave it a try. And was immediately addicted. I've never liked motorcycles -- and the best part is that you don't have to be a fan of them to love this show. Yes, they are a motorcycle club, and there's plenty of riding. But the plotlines, character development and suspense are THE SHOW. I learned about a society I knew nothing about -- and found myself liking and even rooting for these guys. Yes, they are outlaws, but they are some of the most loyal TV characters and they have a moral code that anyone could relate to. Great television. Katey Sagal is OUTSTANDING, and before this, I've never liked her in any other show.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Please change Flash...Please remove the OLDSCHOOL BOOMBOX and modernize him by adding either a backward cap embedded with \\"F\\" for Flash, \\"SS\\" for Subway Surfer or Maybe give him oversized HEADPHONES.Otherwise this game is GREAT. I have it on my Kindle and Android phone, if I could get it on my PS3 I would.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|Nice to listen to. It's not as good as her other CD,s. It takes some getting used to as she seems to be changing her musical direction. If you are a Melody Gardot fan you will enjoy the music.
B009E2U7L2|5.0|My kids loves this album.  They listened to it all the time on my Kindle Fire.  I bought the whole album for $5.00.  What a deal.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this E5 amp because I was having a hard time hearing my mp3 player while interstate cruising on my motorcycle. I have a pretty basic (cheap) mp3 player, & even with my Apple iPod earbuds I was still having a hard time hearing the tunes clearly over the sound of my engine & road noise (not to mention the lack of bass that I get from my mp3 player). The second I plugged this baby in my jaw dropped! What was once flat, slightly &#34;tinny&#34; sound instantly became a well-rounded, full-textured music sound. Highs, mids, & lows all represented clearly. The difference is like night & day. I have since bought myself a Garmin GPS w/mp3 built in, & the E5 greatly improves the sound quality from it as well. I use this amp on my computer's headphones as well.... it's simply amazing, especially for the price.<br /><br />As far as the VOLUME goes, this device absolutely increases the over-all volume output. Maybe not as much as I had expected, but all I needed was a slight boost to the volume, & this certainly does the trick. The battery life lasts me around 10 HOURS of continuous play while turned ALL THE WAY UP & with the &#34;Bass-booster&#34; ON. Charges completely in well under 2 hours. I LOVE THIS AMP & I rarely leave home without it. I have been a musician for over 25 years now & I know good audio when I hear it. Sounds great, boosts volume, charges quickly.... & all for around $25 bucks - this thing is a steal. I've used it daily now for over 3 months & it still works like it did the day I opened it.<br /><br />I def plan to order a second one soon to keep in my saddlebag on my bike. A MUST OWN for music lovers that just need a little boost to the ears. My music has never sounded better than it does when filtered through my FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier!<br /><br />(notes: 1. I generally listen to Metal, Hip-Hop, & Alternative music at very LOUD levels.  2. A very faint &#34;hum&#34; or &#34;buzz&#34; can be heard when plugged in or between songs, but it is totally un-noticable while the music is playing & not bothersome in the least. That is the ONLY negative thing that I can say about this product, & it is not even an issue when using it.)
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing series ever! I wish it could return, but season 3 ended up smashing it.  Please find a way back Gabriel Byrnes.  Please....
