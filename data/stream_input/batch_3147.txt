B001C4CI8U|5.0|Excellent show!!! Very addicting. The story line is great! I have to say that the first season is the best in the series.
1401917232|5.0|Great  book - if you are a spiritual person seeking answers to living in this world and still walking the spiritual path - this book can give you some valuable answers...
B005FISC52|5.0|I love this show... not going to lie; I bawled my eyes out with the last episode. I grew up with this show and when it ended, a small piece of me died :/ GREAT SHOW!!!!!
B00881PPTO|5.0|Always useful in finding the cheapest flights. I just wish it were easier when dates are very flexible it can be time consuming when you don't have a set date.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie! My family and I loved the story line and can't wait to purchase the other movies with the super heroes!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I truly enjoyed the majority of this book. I would love to be able to recommend it to others. But, sadly, I cannot. The Fault in Our Stars is a touching and captivating story about young teenagers facing the harsh cruelties cancer. The book is extremely popular with young teens, which is why I struggle with it so much. Had Mr. Green 's target audience not been teens, my opinion would be completely different. But since it is, I find it inexcusable to sabotage a great story with the  senseless chapter of the two teenage characters losing their virginity. This event is actually a proud/triumphant/certainly not a \\"what we're we thinking/we should not have done that!\\"/moment. With the constant peer pressure our young kids face every day, it sure would have been refreshing if Mr. Green had taken the high road and not encouraged teen sex. I, personally, am very disappointed in Mr. Green, and disappointed in this book. Had the one chapter with the \\"Venn diagram\\" been left out, it could be a great book for our young teens to enjoy. Instead, it's one more attempt to desensitize our kids to immoral and dangerous behavior that the media loves to do. Shame on you, Mr. Green.
B00AG51V8E|5.0|It did hold my attention for most of the movie. Fast paced action throughout. But the ending was predictable. All-in-all it was well written, but after so many recent movies it didn't hold any new twists. Though perhaps that's good.
B0000669JL|3.0|I owned the original Legend in the 80's and was expecting this to sound much the same, but unfortunately it doesn't. When they say remastered they mean it. Unless my memory is failing me, and that is a possibility, I didn't remember some of the songs being recorded at a concert. Why couldn't they just leave it alone, what's next, remastering Tapestry by Carole King? It is still worth listening to this cd but not what I expected.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Have been a Joe fan since the very beginning!! He, I feel, is a very under appreciated artist. This is a great body and quality of work from him. He never disappoints and this was no exception. A great buy!
B000001YOW|5.0|My all-time favorite Porcupine Tree record. Diverse progressive styles of music, that will definitely NOT put you to sleep, as some prog stuff has a habit of doing. As intense as it gets, without transcending into the realm of heavy metal. Top-notch recording of some excellent sounds and sound effects.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The game is a fun game I think it would be better if there was no energy thing so people could play for a long time.
B00006IU73|5.0|If you enjoy the heavier darkness of this era of Porcupine Tree, this is a must have. Excellent recording. Great sound.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|For .99&cent;.It is a great app. It lets you color correct sharpen,darken,lighten. Change the hue. It also lets you add special effects.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic!<br /><br />I've read all the great classic sci-go authors and Hugh is my new favorite. Gripping, moving, detailed yet well paced, wonderful character development. If you like Cory Doctorow, John Scalzi, Ernest Cline, or Orson Scott Card's writing style be prepared to enjoy Hugh Howey. I predict it's not long before he's joined there ranks in both accolades and readership!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best telling of any zombie story yet. Period.  Was a great concept to tell many different stories in one cohesive novel.  Also touched on many parts of a zombie apocalypse I had never read about or thought about. Very original in a genre where most just tell the same story over and over.<br /><br />On a side note, the movie was nothing like the book. In case you were wondering.
B00C1040TO|5.0|This is great for the beginner musician or even someone working on vocal notes. I recommend this app highly. It's easy to use and best of all I have my kindle with me most all the time, so it quite handy to have my tuner every where I go.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|its an app, what can i say, it works fine for what it is supposed to. friendly UI and smooth function
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app will keep you up to date on all the changing weather we now seem to have. It is accurate and gives parametric pressure which is important for this with weather related sensitivities. I love this app.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|good cd player<br />i guess linkin park they never get sick of making good music<br />good old linkin park classic rock and roll
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I use photo shop on my computer but this is a quick and easy tool to use for editing and sharing your photos with comments and added effects. Fun and easy to use. I highly recommend this app for anyone that likes easy editing.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|If you're wondering how carbs like flour, breads, pasta and all the other blood glucose raising foods contribute to obesity, diabetes and dementia, here's the author who can explain it. Taube covers the history of high glycemic grains as well as what those grains are doing to the body. He takes this complex subject and makes it understandable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone I know is hooked on this game. The girls at work even do tag team and try to see who can make it to next level. I'm only hoping I'm one that can put it down.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I have this on my iPhone and it's extremely fun and I'm excited to get it you should get if you like minecraft
0792839676|4.0|This movie is a classic and sets the bar for all others that followed. A must-see for horror fans and Stephen King fans.
0141345659|5.0|This book is great so far I'm almost done! It was delivered quickly and is a quick read. My father died of lung cancer and this was a story that even through the bad and good they have a great outlook and a sense of humor about the dreaded C word.
6305428042|5.0|This is a movie I have loved since it came out. It is entertaining, funny, and suitable for all ages. It's not just for Halloween!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Love the game but wants me to  update and there isn't a spot to update so I can't play. That's the only thing I don't like about it
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was a joy to read this Christmas story again.  I've seen many renditions of this story on many Christmas's but reading this original by Charles himself was a special treat.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's nice if your a Kindle lover cause that you have all the time. Need a calc  -<br />it's right there.
B00F35BV64|3.0|(2.5 stars)    This is what happens when people who don't know s*** about Star Trek make a Star Trek movie.    The story is Dumb with a capital \\"d\\". A blindfolded Sulu could fly the Enterprise through the plot holes. The acting is OK, although I did cringe once or twice. Pegg is a delight and Cumberbatch is brilliant [watch \\"Sherlock\\" if you haven't already]. The special effects are pretty good, but no attempt was made whatsoever to keep the pretend science even remotely grounded in pretend movie physics or medicine. Oh, and forget continuity: the movie is just one fast-paced sequence after another.    Look, an audience needs to see characters grow together before any strong emotional bonds are believable. Shatner & Nimoy's versions had a friendship established over 79 episodes, one movie and 15 years before a story like \\"Wrath of Khan\\" could expect to draw an emotional impact from the audience. The warp-speed bromance between Pine & Quinto is like the love story in a porno: empty, forced and hurried; merely an excuse to get the action going. You can't force an emotional payoff so quickly. That's Writing 101.    For a while I wrote term papers for cash. Even if I knew absolutely nothing about a given subject, with a little research I could fake a 20 page paper well enough to bulls*** an \\"A.\\" That's exactly what J.J. Abrams (who confirmed that he knew nothing about Star Trek before taking the job) has tried to do with Star Trek. Unfortunately for us Trekkies, a screenplay is a lot harder to write than a college thesis. The grade I give this film is a \\"gentleman's C.\\"
B005CGI4EG|3.0|Really poor quality video. I don’t know if the show was just compressed at the time because that was about the time (Heyday) of compression technology or if these are just cheap DVDs. I can tell you this, my DVDs of the Andy Griffith show and Sanford and Son are better quality video. I would be interested to see if anyone else has found better quality video for these. Kelly is hot. And I do NOT even like Blondes
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|It's How I Met Your Mother!  If you're on Season 9, you shouldn't really need encouragement.  You know the greatness of this show.  My only complaint is that Ted finding his Babies' Momma means no more HIMYM.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I think Henry Cavill makes a great Superman. Loved Russell Crowe as Jor-El. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner make great Kents. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, but she is a good actor, and pulled it off. Antje Trauein as Faoro, part of Zodd's team, was fantastic. I really enjoyed her scenes. The film looked great, and I think it was a good start in what is obviously supposed to (they hope) be a successful reboot of an eternally popular franchise. I'm sure they are hoping to make at least 3 or 4 of these new ones.<br /><br />I am definitely interested in the sequel, Batman vs. Superman. I think Ben Affleck will do just fine as Batman. I don't mind when movies stray from cannon and I don't compare this to the classic ones or comics. Obviously, no one can ultimately compare to Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, but I think Henry Cavill does just fine, and he is definitely easy on the eyes. ;) I have no issues with his portrayal, the writing, or the directing. I love all of these superhero movies (Avengers, X-men, etc.), and I'm not too critical.<br /><br />It was entertaining and that is all I ask out of a movie. I rented it on Amazon before buying because I wanted to make sure it would be worth purchasing, and I think it is.
B00ECLU346|1.0|I wanted to love this, but I couldn't even muster up enough positive energy to like it.  The franchise went south with this one. Just terrible.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|Love this movie. It is so cute. Alot like cars. I would recomend this one for any age. I will be watching it over and over.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This musical comedy was far more entertaining than I guessed it to be.  If you want a light-hearted movie, with a few laughs this works.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids love this game, so do I !!! It's  fun and the Minions are so cute.  Highly reccomend this game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I love this book.  I didn't realize it was a romance until the very end, which is a huge compliment.  It was not the usual predictable stuff.  It was super interesting with great characters and a unique situation.  It is about a girl who becomes a home care aid and all the issues she has with the interpersonal aspect of that relationship.  But no icky bodily functions stuff, so that is also a bonus.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I just downloaded this game on yesterday, and I haven't been able to stop playing it. It's hours of fun.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Amazingly visual and a delight to read.<br />Highly recommended if you are even only slightly interested in Nazi Germany.<br />This book was incredibly powerful
0399226907|5.0|My toddler daughter just loves this book.  It is a cute story and parents can expand beyond just the words in the book and help their kids learn colors, names of foods and counting.  She is almost two and now I catch her trying to read it on her own and saying &#34;Still Hungry!&#34; after each part.  LOL
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast device is well worth the money just for $35 you don't have to worry about having cables all over the floor
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|I missed out when these were originally released on DVD because they were insanely expensive.  Not about to miss out this time.  Just about have the collection complete.  Please please make DS9 next.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I LOVE this movie soo much!! Its my favorite John Hughes film. It came out when I was 19 and I loved it then and now. This particular DVD edition, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL SPECIAL COLLECTORS EDITION has along with the movie, some great extras. First is the commentary with the director, who happens to be married to Lea Thompson} ,which is very entertaining. Also there is a making of feature, that I enjoyed a lot. There is also a MEET THE CAST section that shows the actors in the film in interviews then & now and also John Hughes being interviewed that made me a little teary. Lastly, there is a John Hughes Time Capsule section. In conclusion, I would like to say this DVD is truly magical and WONDERFUL!! I would recommend to any John Hughes and or Eric Stoltz fan. This DVD really does this film justice & the music in this film is GREAT too! Oh, and DO NOT believe people who say this movie is a Pretty In Pink rip off!! They are sooooo wrong, John Hughes wrote both and he would NOT copy cat himself. All the charcters are really fleshed out and real in this film!!! I hope you purchase it, the experience will be WONDERFUL!!!  IMARIE
0064431622|5.0|I love all of Eric Carle books and my grandkids do too.  My 7 year old can read this whole book and he loves the colors and the changes the Chameleon goes through.  Great pictures.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Use this one to show off your system to your friends. The quality just doesn't get any better. This was one of the first to use the Panaglide (or Stedicam) system. The camera just smoothly glides through all of it's movements as in following the boy on his tricycle as he rides through the hotel hallways. The camera is at ground level! Also used for the chase at the end through the snow covered maze. Actually, it's used throughout the film. This is one of Stanley Kubrick's best films in my estimation. His last film (Eyes Wide Shut) is a really good film although it's content is certainly for adults only.
0399242864|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I read is constantly to my grandkids.  It is written so well and the pictures are so colorful.  Highly recommend this book.  My grandkids are 5 & 7.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's. The positive message for women is clear:  India.Arie says:  &#34; I know my Creator didn't make no mistakes on me!!&#34;<br />I actually bought this copy for a friend.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Takes a while to load the first few  times it's opened but It speed  up relatively quickly. Addictive. Level up at a decent rate I got 9 levels in 2 days.
159184617X|4.0|I've read a lot about Jonathan Ive in the last 5-10 years, and while this book didn't add a lot to what I knew about him, it adds a few more nuggets. The most interesting part of the book for me is the concept of a &#34;design story&#34;. It's mentioned several times in the book, and it's stated that Mr. Ive begins each project by thinking or saying, &#34;What is the design story?&#34; But sadly it's only glossed over, never discussed in detail. At about $15, I give this book four stars. If it was $25, I'd give it 2-3 stars.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Still listening to it again.  Kristen Chenoweth will always knock your socks off.  I need to see this to truly give the music its due.
B00005ASOC|5.0|If you're an author, or wannabe author, this is a great book. I've written three books, and I still turn it on whenever I need a little motivation. The line, &#34;I'm that one&#34;, is a classic.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this game! I play it all the time, and can't put it down. Can't wait for another one to come out.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app works pretty well and is fairly accurate.  The accuracy varies depending on the charger I use.  Overall  a fairly good estimate of play time left.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Iam The Great White HUNTERRR...and I never would have known without this App!!!  I'm very happy with this ....game ....with the Game in it!!!
B00FFHG6KQ|3.0|Ever heard the commentators say &#34;When this team plays well they play really good, but when they're bad, they're really bad!&#34;? That's how this game is. One game my team is making every shot, hell even my centers are making three's. Next game they're missing layups!<br /><br />It seems as if the game...I don't know has it set to automatically for your team to be hot one game and cold the next, no matter what you do.<br /><br />I started with the Bulls and lost my first game by 43!<br />Won second game by 57<br />Lost 3rd by 78!!!<br />Won by 52<br />lost by 36<br />Won by 45 (23 steals)<br />Now another loss Toronto -113 -Bulls-56 (3 steals)<br /><br />It's frustrating. After a big win you're like I got this game now finally, then you get blown out by low quality teams. Toronto is rated a 63 overall and I get killed? Because of whatever features or auto thing the system may have. I have to reduce two stars. it's freaking annoying.to see your team make every shot one game then miss free throws, open shot, layups etc. the next.
B00ESH04LQ|3.0|I was rather disappointed in this version of Much Ado.  The Brannagh version is one of my all-time favorite pieces of cinema and the play is my favorite of all of Shakespeare's works.  I've been quoting this play since I was in middle school.  I also adore Joss Whedon.  Firefly, Dollhouse, Buffy, Dr. Horrible - all works of writing and film genius.  So I had very high expectations going in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those expectations were not only not met, but they were exceedingly disappointed.  The first, and biggest, problem with this film, for me, was the leads.  Denisof and Acker have absolutely NO chemistry.  It sometimes feels like they're reciting lines to each other to practice for an upcoming performance, not actually performing.  The next problem is the pacing.  It's so frenetic that you don't get to appreciate any of the Bard's witticisms before you're haring off to the next one.  Last, the movie seems to pride itself on being sophisticated.  Yes, we get it, you're all very talented people who are doing Shakespeare! For fun! In secret!  You are the coolest of the cool.  Yawn.<br /><br />There are some bright spots.  Fran Kranz's turn as Claudio was both charming and infuriating.  Nathan Fillion's Dogberry was amusing with a hilarious Tom Lenk following on as Verges.  In fact, most of the supporting cast, with a few notable exceptions in Reed Diamond as Don Pedro and Emma Bates as a bland Margaret, were excellent in their roles.  Sean Maher made a deliciously vile Don John.<br /><br />Still, overall this was quite a disappointment to me.  It felt flat and claustrophobic.  I had hoped for much better.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|there was a problem with the he movie downloading it started and then stated it wasn't available at that time.  :( not happy paying for a movie and not being able to watch it.
B00422LESO|1.0|I really didn't care for the main character in this.  She's whiny, completely self-absorbed and most of the supporting characters are even worse.  They all seemed to be selfish, rotten people, none of whom I'd like to be around for as much as five minutes.  The author also clearly sneers at anyone who'd want to dress up and do living history in any form as someone with too much time on their hands and more money than sense.  As a reenactor that attitude certainly rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />I have hope for the movie as Keri Russell can light up pretty much anything she's in, but the fact that it was already released and I don't remember ever seeing it in theaters is a bad sign.  I will be waiting for it to stream on Netflix to catch it.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|Love this movie, I have a screen crush on Anne. But this offering is a standard blu-ray but I love the movie.
B00E21YOLO|4.0|Had to watch it twice to figure out the plot as it was so fast paced. It ties in with the original Star Trek about the orgin of Kahn, but with a twist as the new Star Trek movies follow an alternate future caused by a black hole in the first movie.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Get it all done at the same time. Not too many frills but I really just bought this for Wrath of Khan anyways.....
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was worried because didn't see how to angle this flash but got it because of the reviews and price. I couldn't be happier. The body of the flash does not tilt but the flash itself does tilt up so I was happy. My D3000 recognized it immediately. It will go into standby in case you forget to turn it off. I am really happy with this product. I use the Sony BCG34HRE4KN rechargable batteries with it.
034580404X|5.0|Bought for my wife and I.....Good value for the set. I like the size of each book too if that makes sense.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|Doesn't seem to work on the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  Does just fine on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  What's up with that?
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|The storyline was interesting at first but by halfway through the book I found myself skimming pages looking for \\"good parts\\". I gave the book two stars for the two characters who did impress me. Rose and the nun were one to love and one to loath.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far I have played this game a little each day using that day's energy.  I am playing another game at the same time that is one I bought from same company.  I like these so much and will continue buying them.  Thank you.  I also like the fact that I can play some games on my new Android phone.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I did enjoy the characters in this story very much. I hope there were lots of Hans and Rosas in Germany during those dark days in Germany. Loved their humanity.  Well written too. The author paints vivid pictures with his words. Different from what I generally read. Plenty of sadness but still uplifting.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Got here on time. Well packaged. Performs as advertised.Seems to be a good product for the price. Sturdy well made.
0061950726|5.0|I loved this book.  At first it was difficult to get into because it was written from 2 different time frames.  But once I got into it, it flowed nicely.  A true story.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Great story with a lot of deeper meaning that is not too complicated. Opens up the concept of a Higher power by accepting almost any religion as a vehicle to spiritualism. That also implies religious dogma is not even needed. Probably a strong Buddhist influence behind the writers thinking when it's all said and done. The power of GPU computing is on display in this movie. Most of the content is CG. Pretty well done. Computer generated content in movies will only get more pervasive and will improve greatly in the future. Watch the remaster of Lawrence of Arabia.on BLU-Ray as a benchmark. The old way was a great way to do it too. I don't think CG will ever surpass this masterpiece. If it does, then we will finally get those flying cars seen in old issues of Pop Sci.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I enjoyed the flow of the book , the unbiasedness and the scientific analysis is appreciated, especially that Reza is a muslim bible scholar (which drove fox news interviewer nuts). I noticed the use of heavy classical english words that could have been replaced by easier ones.<br />I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of religions ...
B00F35BV64|1.0|This was a waste of time, resource and effort.<br /><br />IT IS NOT ****STAR TREK**** - save you money, this thing is a REAL DOG.<br /><br />It is an insult to the memory of Gene Roddenberry. Like the other Abrams dog, it should NEVER have been made.
B00B2166BS|5.0|If you own a nexus 10, get this NOW.  Like everyone else has stated, no idea why they didn't include it from the get go.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|My first ever DJing Set.And Plus my name's D.J.Funny meant for me.But Ya have to have MUSIC on your device to Enjoy this Amazing App:)
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Excellent Movie - Love Chirs Pine - Tech is so Cool - Cannot wait for the Series to continue.  Need to see this movie
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Awesome game just wish the objective button and the ranking button worked. More maps too. I can't stop playing this game it's addictive.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is an absolutely great portrayal of Abraham Lincoln during his Presidency.  Daniel Day Lewis made a perfect Abraham Lincoln, and the story as told was compelling.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast does exactly what it says it will do and does it very well.<br /><br />I have a ROKU. It's a great device, but it doesn't support Youtube.<br />Bummer!<br /><br />Chromecast does have support for Youtube videos..<br />For $35 my problem is solved.<br />Simple!
1439102813|5.0|This book touchingly tells the story of a woman who is gradually falling into dementia.  It was beautifully told and helped me understand the challenges of dementia.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this app because not only do you get to experience the movie but also there is always something new. I love the challenges against friends.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Marvel is building a library of film classics. This one truly deserves to be among them. As often happens in the comic books, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has the hero part firmly in hand and the Hulk (CGI) snatches it away from him without actually trying. He's just being the Hulk. Hulk does this more than once. Kudos to Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson--would have liked to see the Wasp) and also to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo).
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all three books it was great from start to end. I was so interesting I read them in two weeks.  Hope u write more.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is so good I uninstalled the app that was SUPPOSED to free up memory and installed this one. It's faster, more effective, more communicative (tells you what it's done) and flexible (only deletes what you want cleaned not anything else) than the other app.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It is haunting and beautifully written. Such an awful topic delved into with much respect.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Finally something to manage downloads from email or the web. This is something that has frustrated me with Kindle Fire since the beginning. I had another file management app that I downloaded and it just fought with my KF. I would download (or even upload by USB) files and then wonder where they went. This gives everything a folder and it's either very clear or just plain intuitive as to where the folder/file is located. Moving it to somewhere else on the KF is also quite easy.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I'm enjoying the game so far just wish the energy would refill faster that's the only reason I tend to loose interest in games like this
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is my first review and the first book I felt like devoting my time to.  Mr Grisham shows us again, as he did in \\"A Time To Kill\\" his seemingly effortless writing skill.  He is descriptive without being wordy, his characters as real as your own family and his emotion-evoking plots so created  that you feel like a character from chapter one. You can smell the food cooking and taste the sour-mash as it trickles down your tongue.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham also has a knack for approaching the southern race issues and at the end, there is a better appreciation for each race.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|You'll be addicted when you start this truly fun-tastic game.  I've stayed away from any cheats, which I think makes it better.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. A true story of survival and the dedication our armed services show during war. A gripping account of a mission gone bad and what these brave men sacrificed. Outstanding, gripping and painful all at the same time. A must read for anyone who wants to know what a real hero it all about. Marcus is just one of several in this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The real life effect of this app is awesome. It would be good if the market was more affordable though...
B0091VTNZC|5.0|It is an instant classic - the character  lines are genius! Will Ferrell is both lovable and hilarious!  One of my favorite movies.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Enough said... this is one of those games that is very hard to put down. Once you start you cannot put it down.
0887307280|4.0|This is the right analysis of what are the short commings are ignored when one starts a small business. Good
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'm addicted now and won't miss taping an episode on TV. Love it! Love it! Even got my husband to watching it with me. This CD set got me started since I missed the show when it started. Now I'm up to date.
1476727651|2.0|Was expecting something that really incorporated elements of &#34;The Shining&#34; but, with the exception of Danny being the main character and a cheesy ending involving the spirit of Jack, it was pretty much a stand alone story- and not a good one.  Felt like King just phoned it in. I'd write more detail but it's not necessary.  I think you'll be disappointed.
0553807919|4.0|This is a very well conceived and executed book, and very worth your time.  The authors do a tremendous job of translating neurobiology and cognitive psychology into basic language for a general audience, for use in direct child interactions.  Through each of their 12 strategies for understanding and interacting with &#34;The Whole-Brained Child,&#34; the authors begin by describing in an unintimidating manner the portion of the brain and its function that will be subsequently discussed from a behavioral standpoint.  From here, they use that behavioral basis and give very detailed examples of how to handle child behavior stemming from the associated biology, referring back to the brain as a reference point rather than as the focus.<br /><br />The point of the book, all science aside, is in dealing with certain child developmental features and behaviors (such as implicit memory, tantrums, fear of failure) by connecting with children directly.  The science is used to serve as a backdrop but is a fascinating addition to what otherwise would be a simple behavioral book.  Instead of just saying HOW to interact with children, the authors show us WHY, which lends a much greater and more nuanced understanding to the how.  This book provides a unique opportunity to read about everyday situations with children and relate them quickly and easily to a neurobiological level.<br /><br />Though the authors say the book can be for direct childcare practitioners (such as teachers and daycare workers), the obvious target is parents.  Here there are some issues.  The book seems to be written for a white, suburban, middle class parent as opposed to the general population.  Additionally, the practicality of some of the strategies is not immediately apparent, and the amount of effort required for many parents will be substantial - a paradigm shift for some ways.  The illustrations are helpful in showing the dos and don'ts (not labelled as such, thankfully), but I found myself thinking the don'ts were many parent's default.  The strategies really are a shift in thinking and require a lot of skill and investment to execute, but they are definitely achievable.  In no way does this book alienate parents with over-expectations.<br /><br />I also felt some situations I felt were not addressed adequately.  Most of the examples of child behavior and parental involvement deal with more mundane, everyday occurrences from the 'average' child.  If you are interested in how to explain to your child what death is, this book doesn't venture into those dangerous waters.  Nor does it address more difficult children.  Additionally, the section of bringing implicit memories to the explicit is somewhat suspect in its claims and its basis, which some may find hypocritical.  If implicit memories are necessarily altered as the authors say, why would a parent with altered memories of an incident helping a child reconstruct the child's own altered memories of that same incident serve to help the child?  I wonder too about parental inconsistency when using these strategies.  Again, they are intensive and hard to do in the moment the behavior is being exhibited by the child.  I do believe these are not major issues, however. The authors' stress on underlying the importance of connection, integration of thought, and mindset make most of the above manageable simply by establishing a trusting baseline relationship with the child.<br /><br />Overall, I believe the pros of this book outweigh the negatives, though they should be noted.  The authors' ability to successfully and fluently translate incredibly intricate science to the common reader (no college degree seems necessary for reading, but a level of literacy is assumed) is no small feat.  It makes me wish more laboratory experiments that have real-world implications can be taken by researchers into the hands of the people that actually need and use them on a daily basis.  Parents will find the strategies difficult to implement and will certainly encounter situations not touched upon here, but this is well worth the read.  And it won't take you long...the writing style is easy to follow, the science unobtrusive and accessible, and the situations are often in dialogue-form and wonderfully vivid.  Along with the illustrations and a very helpful appendix at the end denoting in which age ranges a parent should expect certain behaviors to manifest in, this book is a win.ent and will certainly encounter situations not touched upon here, but this is well worth the read.

B00DQBWLSO|3.0|All of the music was pretty low key.  Good if you're looking something to just mellow out to (or nap to), but didn't have the energy or emotion that I've felt in previous CD's by John Mayer.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|ahhhhhhhh, BUY IT!!!! I've been an avid Eminem fan for the past decade. Lyrically, he is amazing. You will not be disappointed with this album. Em has grown up, but his whitty rhymes and crafty beats still remain. Not a bad song on the whole album.

B00EP7A446|5.0|What can you say about this icon singing iconic songs?  Fabulous.  And that’s actually an understatement.<br />In the past, I have noticed people commenting that the first version of a song they hear (the one they grew up with?) is the one they like the best, and anyone else’s version just doesn’t sound “as good.”  Not so with Cliff Richard.  First, there’s the voice.  Then there’s his arrangement.  He usually changes the song just enough that it sounds fresh and completely Cliff.  With these songs, he kept the flavor of the “old” rock and roll from the 50s but there are some changes (tempo? words?) that make the songs sound new.<br /><br />If I had to have one complaint it would be that, of the songs from his tour, Fabulous is included but Paralyzed is omitted, but I guess a CD can only be so long?  So, if you want to hear him sing that ‘medley’ you’ll have to see his DVD Still Reelin’ and A-Rockin’/Live in Sydney (which you might want to see anyway … 2 hours of some of his hits along with a few songs from this CD … I was there in Sydney and the DVD is also Fabulous!).<br /><br />Since the songs don’t seem to be listed here, they are: Rip It Up, Wake Up Little Susie, Poetry in Motion, Sealed with a Kiss, Stood Up, Such a Night, School Days, Teddy Bear & Too Much, Don’t Let Go, Dream Lover, Stuck on You, Fabulous, Rave On, Johnny B. Goode, One More Sunny Day
B00GOQ9M4O|3.0|I have read alot of the other reviews, and as I have also seen every episode aired I agree and disagree.  I love the show as a whole.  5 stars but this season so far is making me rethink even watching the show anymore.  If episodes 3 this season haven't been bad enough episode 4 has put the nail in the coffin.  Here's hoping episode 5 does something incredible to turn it around.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love the game but wish it would download on my pc.  Would recommend this game to everyone.  Good luck
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Way too self-indulgent. 771 pages. The length doesn’t bother me, so long as I’m engaged, a book can go on forever as far as I’m concerned. But when it’s 771 pages of meandering prose touching on everything in tremendous detail, it can get excruciating & sometimes desultory. TMI, as some would say.<br /><br />Donna Tartt’s writing is beautiful and evocative and she seems knowledgeable in a myriad of subjects. If you love New York, her descriptions of Manhattan will take you right there. You’ll learn about Rembrandt & his students – most notably the artist who painted The Goldfinch (who, interestingly, existed) & whose fate is shared tragic comedy style with his painting. You’ll also learn about drugs (both illegal & prescription), alcohol & their dependencies, antique furniture & the painstaking steps in their restoration… etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />About 80% through, the ball falls for me. Everything was hollow. The protagonist seemed the most self-absorbed character I had come across in a long time. Although his childhood friend was previously an engaging & favourite character, his antics become increasingly implausible. Leaving me cold. The end could not come sooner for me.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book as it centers around a very young boy, and I was worried it would be a story better suited for young readers. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the book contained very mature themes. It was an easy read, but not boring. I think especially the ending is very moving. I give it 4 stars because I think there were a few points in the book that dragged or seemed repetitive, but overall it was a very enjoyable story.
B007Z9QA8K|2.0|Not very good streaming quality. No high definition. But the movie and watched it but no high-quality us it was supposed to.
B00G70JQZC|2.0|I hardly ever write reviews. they are mostly pointless. Hugh Jackman played his character very well since day one, however this film seemed to have all the wrong people making it.  I may be ignorant, on some sort of historic comic back story, but to me, this was a let down for the most part, and I found myself thinking wtf, during many parts of this work of, something.  After x-men origin, the aim should have been much, much higher.  To sum it all down to a word, and also a question; Why?
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Readers don't like the ending.  IMHO that is when the book got back to why I loved Divergent and Insurgent.  I did not feel that the world at the airport was developed as well as the faction headquarters in the first two books.  I did not feel like I got to know the new characters as well either. But as much as I may have hoped it would have ended differently, that is when things finally made sense to me.

0345530578|4.0|A great read, entertaining and informative. Hard to put down. The plot develops before the reader's eyes. The dénoument comes as an entertaining surprise.
1476729085|2.0|I picked up this book because I liked the premise of the book and that it was offered as a comedy. I am always in the mood for a few good laughs. In the beginning I was laughing. The way that Don over analyzed everything. Then there was the big debate with his date over the difference between apricot and mango and peach ice cream. To Don you can sub mango or peach for apricot and to his date, there is a huge difference and apricot is apricot.<br /><br />However my fondness for Don quickly went away. I then found him very narrow minded and he came off mean. He was picking on everyone's qualities with a fine tooth comb. Yet, he was not Mr. Perfect by a long shot. I struggled to stick with this book. I even skipped a bunch of chapters to get to the middle hoping it would get better. While it did see to some with the appearance of Rosie, Don still at this point could not let loose. By then I was done with the book and did not care how it ended.

B000SINT52|5.0|In \\"Farenheit 9/11,\\" Michael Moore composed the finest, and to my knowledge the only, video documentary that explains the connections between the Bush Family and the House of Saud. While books have been written on this subject (such as [[ASIN:0743253396 House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties]]) seeing this illustrated in motion picture form is exceptionally hard-hitting and visceral. Not only does Moore show how this deep relationship affects US domestic and foreign policy, he also goes into the relationship between the Bush and Bin Laden families. This partnership has been rather lucrative for both sides, and caused the Bush Whitehouse a bit of trouble after 9/11; for which they edited out several sections of the Congressional Report which many believed contained information on these partnerships.<br /><br />Moore then deftly weaves the Saud/Bush strain with the growing frustration and despair on the part of the American troops in Iraq shortly after Saddam's regime was toppled. Along this line, he profiles the story of Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a soldier killed while serving in the invasion. Her story is powerful. In one scene she reads her son's last letter from Iraq, where he expresses anger at President Bush for putting he and fellow soldiers in that country. This was moving. The trials of this family no doubt reflect the turmoil of all families that have lost loved ones in battle. The various interviews Moore includes of soldiers in Iraq, and those who have returned wounded and are now at Walter Reed are enlightening. The youth of these soldiers is remarkable. They are kids in large part, and were inserted into a mission that required close, urban combat. The brutality of war hits the viewer in the face and will touch your heart.<br /><br />This documentary is the type of reporting Americans deserved to receive when these events were unfolding. Instead, major media outlets cheered the invasion of a sovereign country which had not attacked ours. Watching in hindsight, I'm amazed at our gullibility, and at the fact that voices of dissension were squelched and censored. Iraq is now a mess. A once stable country was turned inside out with wholesale slaughter, creating a power vacuum and sparking intra-Muslim violence throughout the region between various Sunni and Shia interests. This documentary is an earnest attempt to awaken Americans to this tragedy. The betrayal of trust by a government only interested in profits should be viewed by all. Bravo, Mr. Moore!a sovereign country which had not attacked ours. Watching in hindsight, I'm amazed at our gullibility, and at the fact that voices of dissension were squelched and censored.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey delivered this book just as expected. Funny and saying it like she just don't care. She was able to touch upon many issues and struggles that she faces in her life as a writer, producer, mother, wife, and her craft; with self-deprecating humor allowing her readers to identify with her struggles (though these struggles may not really be struggles like those affected by typhoons in Philippines - which she recognizes it herself). I laughed out loud at the many funny lines in book, imagining it being said like Liz Lemon.<br /><br />I am glad that we do have this book to refer back to one day if someone asked me in the future what it was like being a working woman in the millennial. The pop culture references which we are surrounded by everyday, her work on SNL as Sarah Palin, the choices she makes as a working mother, makes this book a great one to keep!

1593275080|5.0|This is a well done Lego book. The creations featured are perfect examples of adult built models, as most (if not all) do not include any mini figured themed builds. It has a diverse collection of sculptural builds of everyday things, such as food, animals, and vehicles, as well as big and small architecture builds with themes ranging from realistic to pure imagination. The level of detail within the builds allows you to look over it again and again and pick up something new each time. And despite the variety of builds and inclusion of many different builders and styles, everything is cohesive and beautifully laid out. It's the perfect coffee table book, as both kids and adults will be wowed by the content.<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*

I've found that the talent (or anyone) touching the metal cylinder that holds the batteries introduces a hum to the audio. If I make sure it is in a pocket or otherwise away from hands or anything that might provide a path to power or ground, it works and sounds great. It may be just my unit but I haven't had time to return it to find out.

B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Overall enjoyable movie.  The special effects and story of the movie was quite well.  The reason for the four star rating was because it just felt that there was something missing.  To me it seems that there could have been a better interaction between the characters.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Being and avid trekkie (so not ashamed to say it), I tend to go with the attitude that if it's not in line with the classics, it's a wannabe. I heard some &#34;iffy&#34; reviews, but I saw it, and I was surprised. I definitely has a young, updated feel, but it does follow the original series in many respects. The only thing I did have a problem with (but thankfully was subjected to for mere seconds at the end) was the romantic relationship between Spock and Uhura. I just couldn't buy it. But the movie itself was pretty good, and there was enough action, but not too much to make it just another blow things up movie. I recommend giving it a try, you may be surprised.
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|We're the Millers was hysterical!  I've never laughed so hard in my whole life.  Such a refreshing movie to see, on a cold winters evening.  The character's, Kenny, Casey, Rose, and David together make the greatest family ever! With their misadventures one after another.  It was pretty much non-stop laughter for me.  The movie also has a sweet message in the ending..With some cute bloopers. Most movies have a little punch of laughter every once in a while.  We're The Millers was non-stop!<br />While  I'm not a big Jennifer Aniston fan,  she really pulled her role off in, We're The Millers.<br />Great! Movie! The best I've seen all year!<br />You can't go wrong renting this hysterical movie.<br /> It's a movie worth your time..Get ready to be entertained.<br />You'll never look at a family traveling in an RV,  the same way ever again! I'd give this movie 10 stars if I could.

B00DXP7L88|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Dexter so when season 8 was about to be released on DVD and I saw the negative reviews on Amazon and elsewhere I was already prepared to be disappointed.  Don't believe any of the reviews - if you like this show, watch the last season and make your own judgment.  The last few seasons weren't as strong as the earlier ones, and I thought the last season fit right in with the last few.  It was almost as good as season 6 or 7 - I'd have to admit this was probably the weakest season overall.  But not nearly as bad or as weak as I was led to believe.  As I watched each episode I was entertained and surprised just like I'd always been with this show.  I liked everything about season 8 including the very end.  The story of Dr. Vogel alone was great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a amazing game thanks kulio rod making a great game a little like temple run but a better feel.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This, like the other books in the series was extremely well written - the story beautifully told. Having said that, there's a direction that the plot takes that I would have preferred that it did not (I liked how the Burn Notice TV series ended much better), but the story was still told extremely well. Having said that, now that I have read the entire series, I don't have a lot of motivation to re-read and re-experience the ending - maybe that will change with time. My greatest critisizm of the book is how the emotions of the two main characters are portrayed - their feelings were handled the same way. This makes sense when it comes to Tris, but not for Four. Overall, great series and book. Much better read than Hunger Games - huge difference in quality of writing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow from the first book, and leaves you with one of the WTF cliff hangers, good book, you should read it
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|One of the best Pendergast books yet!  Good action and believable drama.<br />Still somewhat loose on your chemistry of mercury and mercury compounds yet it probably passed muster with most non-professionals.<br />As a Sherlockian of many years I found the &#34;lost adventure&#34; to be a wonderful addition!<br />Good reintroduction of Corrie and mention of history and actions of past characters.<br />While we didn't really believe Corrie was roasted alive, the angst, sorrow and consequent actions of Pendergast were thrilling.<br />I greatly enjoyed your emotional Epilogue.<br />Good book!

B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I purchased this to run OpenELEC's XBMC and it runs like an absolute dream!  I tossed in a 4 GB stick of RAM I had lying around and use PXE network boot to run OpenELEC, so that was all I needed.  It runs absolutely silent and sits around 10% to 20% CPU usage in use, even playing back 1080p bluray rips in MKV format.  I'm told it draws only a minuscule amount of power which is a terrific benefit, so I just leave it on 24x7.<br /><br />I was a little concerned with the Celeron processor, thinking it might not be enough power, but it has proven to be overkill so I am thrilled with the purchase.<br /><br />I have been waiting for a device like this for many years, but boy has Intel nailed it!!<br /><br />The only con I have is that before I updated the firmware to the latest and greatest I had performance problems.  However, it was a cinch to update the firmware and it fixed all the issues.  You just toss the file on a USB stick and then boot up into the special firmware update mode off the BIOS boot menu.  That will find the file on the USB stick and complete the process within a few minutes and you are good to go.

Some good satire about tobacco, alcohol & gun PR, but they're such easy targets, even a hack like Buckley can make them look bad.<br /><br />According to Buckley,  the whole point of the book; the 'lesson' is, when you hear something in the media, always ask, &#34;Who says?&#34;<br /><br />That's not the question you should ask, because what's important is what is said, not who says it. Buckley is his dad's son, all right. All brilliant rationalization in the service of flawed ideas.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|It held my interest from beginning to end. I liked finding out how the relationships with all the main characters would turn out.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|Although The Book Thief is wordy, it lacks substance.  It is poorly written, and when you strip away the literary devices the author uses, there is little story left.  The characters are not developed, not believable, and not sympathetic.  The contrived narrator, Death, is allegedly telling a story it does not (and cannot) understand, namely of LIFE.<br /><br />Who was the book thief, really?  The author allowed us glimpses of her, but he never allowed us to know her.  The stories within the story are boring and plot-less, and they leave an intelligent reader wondering what purpose they serve. Throughout the book there is author intrusion--he does not trust his readers to get his point so he liberally (heavy-handedly)  punctuates the prose with bullet points and bolded summaries to make sure his audience gets it.  Instead of employing drama in a masterful way, he attempts to make this a &#34;page-turner&#34; by stating a fact and then saying &#34;but more about that later.&#34;  He offers what appear to be cunning made-up words and turns of phrases to make the novel seem poetic, deep, and meaningful, but they are not cunning, and it is not deep or meaningful.<br /><br />What, exactly, is the meaning of this book?  The topic--the Holocaust--is, on its own merits, heart-wrenching and disturbing. In writing this book, the author is not attempting to expose the unspeakable horrors of that shameful episode of history so that mankind will not forget.  Instead, he has used it to thrust himself into the limelight and reap in profits.  I suspect that this is one of those rare books that will be a better movie than it was a book--and isn't that where the profits really are?

161655164X|5.0|I'm very satisfied with the artbook, very detailed and extensive. Text's describing developer's challenges and decision-making is interesting aswell. As this is arguably one of the best console games of the generation, its worth buying for the sake of remembrance alone. 5/5

B00BD99JMW|4.0|This series was compelling and heartbreaking.  I began reading Allegiant wondering how all the loose ends could possibly be tired.  Despite my heartache, the ending was actually quite satisfying.  Roth stayed true to the world and characters that she created.  It was an emotional but enjoyable read.
0345530578|4.0|Another one of Grisham's greats !! The story line is so good the reader will just want to keep reading to find out what the characters are up to. And when you think you might have if figured out, a new element is tossed in to make you think again. It's a really good book to read and very thrilling. I suggest you get a copy and enjoy a very good mystery.

This story needs to be told in every drivers ed class. I'll be donating my copy after it makes the rounds in my family. I have met Lisa and can tell you she is an inspiration and a wonderful person! I hope to meet her children one day, and through her story I expect them to be awesome and inspirational as well. Thank you all for your willingness to share such a horrible tragedy.  Thank you Lisa for proving once again that a mother's love for her children can work miracles!

It's the best soul/R&B album that's been made in a long ass time.  Buy it now.  Redeem your shame.
1400082773|5.0|Not one for politicans but, this book is pretty good on the insight to Obama's personal life. From him being a member of the ethnic group Luo and a mother who is European,to stuggling to find his Afrakan identity in life. The read is straight forward and simple. Barack tackles challenges of life. Not having a father figure has to be a young males biggest foe, this to me is Barack's biggest hurdle he jumped and succeeded. Also, seeing racism or race based discrimation, from his mainly European family. The book will make you laugh if anything else at some of the things who goes through. This more than his politcs I would recommend reading.

However, I personally wish I would have just checked it out from the library instead of purchasing it.

B008JFUO36|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />In the U.S., 'Oblivion' grossed approximately $89 million. Overseas it was close to $197 million. What does this tell us? For all those non-English speaking people, the Oblivion narrative perhaps wasn't all that important--special effects and one action scene after another, were the key to the overseas success. Here perhaps word got out that this Tom Cruise vehicle was not as gripping in terms of narrative, as the Oblivion marketing people, led us to believe. There were possible reasons for this, mainly having to do with the nature of the story itself.<br /><br />As I found this sci-fi, action adventure film to be mediocre at best, I have no trepidations about giving away the main twist that the main plot rests its head on. So if you haven't seen the film, I strongly suggest you quit reading here and read some of the more critical reviews found at Metacritic, which don't give away the whole kit and caboodle.<br /><br />We're led to believe that Tom Cruises' 'Jack Harper', is a drone repairman in charge of servicing various sphere-shaped drones that emanate from a tetrahedral space station dubbed 'Tet', run by the 'good 'guys'--the surviving humans, represented by the mission commander, 'Sally', who it turns out is a computer generated entity, similar to the 'HAL' of 'A Space Odyssey'. Harper has been told that the drones service and protect fusion power generators on earth that are supposedly extracting the necessary energy for a plan to have the rest of humanity migrate to the Saturn moon, Titan. All this after an apocalypse on earth, caused by alien 'Scavengers'. Harper believes that humans defeated the 'Scavs' after they destroyed the moon, decimating earth due to the resulting gravitational shifts. Remnants of the Scavengers still remain on earth, attempting to destroy the drones which must keep the power generators operating.<br /><br />Before the break into the second act of the story, 'Oblivion' operates as a typical sci-fi action adventure flick. Harper's significant other, Victoria (aka Vika), has dramatically little to do, operating the computer console and assisting Harper keep track of the drones back at their house 'in the clouds'. At a certain point, Harper gets involved in a chase with the drones very reminiscent of the chase inside the death star in Star Wars. Finally, things get mildly interesting when Harper saves Julia, a human astronaut in stasis from before the apocalypse on earth. Harper has vague memories of Julia, despite having his memory 'wiped' by his overseers.<br /><br />When Harper discovers that he's a clone, he finally figures out that the 'Scavs' are actually the good guys as they are not aliens but humans who are battling the true aliens, represented by 'Sally' up in the 'mother ship'. So the second half has Harper joining forces with the Scavs, in their effort to destroy the aliens. It turns out that right before the alien invasion, there was a mission to Titan with the original Harper and Vika as the astronauts at the controls. Those two turn back to engage the aliens but before doing so, jettison the rest of the crew (including Julia), who turns out to be Jack's wife before the apocalypse. Harper and Vika are the prototypes used by the aliens to create the clones.<br /><br />'Oblivion' asks us to applaud the twists and turns in the plot, particularly the revelation that Harper is a clone and the Scavs are actually human. But it's not enough to make this compelling drama. The problem is that Cruise is not pitted against a well drawn out antagonist throughout the narrative. Before the 'big twist', Cruise as Harper battles the faceless 'Scavs', who look like rejects from the first Star Wars series. Even after it's revealed that Sally and her minions, are the true villains, Harper spends most of his time battling the antagonists' surrogates: the drones who are constantly trying to annihilate him. This is alsotrue of the first half of Act II--it's the opposition to the drones that basically fuels most of the conflict in the script. 'Oblivion' really is reduced to a standard sci-fi actioner for most of the time.<br /><br />'Oblivion' also feels like an amalgam of many sci-fi predecessors. We've already alluded to 'Star Wars' but one is also reminded of 'Planet of the Apes', in its scenes of a ruined New York City after the apocalypse (here it's the shell of the Empire State Building which triggers Harper's memories of meeting Julia for the first time)--of course in 'Planet', it's the 'Statue Liberty' that gets the end of the world treatment.<br /><br />Both 'Oblivion' and 'I, Robot' have similar antagonists--a female voice which represents an entire computer network. Both 'Sally' and 'VIKKI', serve similar functions and both Will Smith and Tom Cruise must destroy the network in order to save the day. 'I, Robot', however, is much more compelling since Will Smith's character has a complex ally to play off of ('Sonny' the robot). Not so for Cruise, whose strongest ally is Julia (who is hardly what you would call a foil at all).<br /><br />'Oblivion' just rates an average 2.5 out of 5.0 in my book. It's got some nice special effects and that one big aforementioned twist. But in the end, 'Oblivion' is nothing more than a glorified 'shoot em up', with Cruise playing his usual 'good guy' part. I certainly wouldn't discourage the first time viewer from watching it but it's not something I would want to take a peek at, on a second go-round at all.true of the first half of Act II--it's the opposition to the drones that basically fuels most of the conflict in the script.

B00G21YGKQ|5.0|&#34;Doctor Who At the Proms&#34; is an awesome version of this great concert, conducted by the wonderful Ben Foster, with very high video and audio quality even over streaming (the HD version is worth the extra  dollar). This version only edits out some of the talky bits, Orff's &#34;O Fortuna&#34; and the Oodish &#34;Song of Freedom&#34; from the original Radio 3 broadcast. As far as I can recall, all of the special appearances and hosting are intact in this 90 minute version.<br /><br />I personally find this to be the most enjoyable of the Doctor Who Proms (compared to 2008 and 2013) in terms of the Murray Gold compositions selected (heavy on Series 5), and the surprise appearances (NO SPOILERS!). This video and performance includes:<br />- &#34;Mad Man with a Box&#34;<br />- &#34;Fish Custard&#34;<br />- &#34;I Am the Doctor&#34;<br />- Gustav Holst's &#34;The Planets: Mars (Bringer of War)&#34;<br />- &#34;Battle in the Skies (Daleks vs Spitfire)&#34;<br />- &#34;Amy&#34;<br />- &#34;Liz, Lizards, Vampires and Vincent&#34;<br />- Richard Wagner's &#34;Die Walk&uuml;re – The Ride of the Valkyries&#34;<br />- &#34;This is Gallifrey&#34; / &#34;Vale Decem&#34;  ((( you will want to cheer and cry as you watch this marvelous segment )))<br />- &#34;Pandorica Suite&#34;<br />- &#34;Doctor Who Theme&#34;<br /><br />For those who watch this on a Kindle Fire that has X-Ray, this is a super feature with this video... real-time cast listings, trivia and song titles as it plays along. Although I have this video on one of my DVDs, I'm absolutely loving this version on my Knidle Fire HDX, and will certainly be looking for more Doctor Who specials for my collection.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover is my favorite author. All of her books are amazing... And Slammed is no different. This book deserves way more than only the 5 stars allotted to grade it. I absolutely fell for Will and Lake from the beginning. The hardships life has thrown them and how they somehow manage to look forward and just live and love is astounding. This is the first of her Slammed series and I am already swooning to read book 2 (&#34;Point Of Retreat&#34;)...can't wait for the continuation of this beautiful story.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Hauntingly real...and yet strangely heartwarming in the way that such disparate women can create loving communities and families within their peculiar prison culture. Kerman's book sheds an unsentimental but immensely human light on prison life. After reading the book, I had wanted to see the Netflix series of the same name. However, I stopped downloading mid-stream, because I didn't want my own images of the women and the settings to become blurred by someone else's vision. The story and people within it have stayed with me for several days. I consider that one if the highest kudos an author can achieve.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm so happy I finally read this, equally sad that I didn't read it earlier and devastated that I can't read it for the first time again. You can see why the author cites Neal Stephenson as an influence, but he feels like a Robert Galbraith.  It looks like these two books came out back to back in 2011, but I read Reamde as commanded because I'm a geek for Neal. You will experience the same themes and even some similar character types in each. Snow Crash is an obvious influence for both authors, but Ernest Cline gets it MORE right. He comes so much closer to the true form of the image flashing on the wall.  You must read this now, don't wait until this future is here.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I like it because it is a very good game and it is how I like it. This is a very good game for you if you like farming. I don't  FARM much but I love this app. I hope you enjoy playing the game.

B00DHBOQMM|5.0|More than once, Michael Connelly makes approving (justified) reference to the film version of 'the Lincoln Lawyer'.  Unlike the very sorry film version of 'Blood Work'.<br /><br />'The Lincoln Lawyer' features prominently in that one of Michael Haller's success stories from it, turns out not to have been a success.  The rehabilitation of the drug addict-prostitute Gloria Dayton turns out to have been short lived, with her appearing in the beginning as the murder victim of the client Haller spends the entire novel defending.<br /><br />Hieronymus Bosch also makes a brief appearance in a tangentially related case.<br /><br />An engrossing and satisfactory read.
148951418X|1.0|Not much useful info here. Save your money or spend it on an accessory. Half the book is taken up with photos of different mounting devices. You can find all that stuff for free at GoPro.Com. Was hoping to find more troubleshooting advice and technical information. You won't be finding it here. Lots of pages of bad photos with a couple of words. Written at a third grade level.

Every song on this CD is excellent. Mostly upbeat, great tunes, good lyrics. This will be a major group if their next release if even half as god as this one!

0307887448|5.0|In 1981 I remember sitting with my friends Jim  and Karl as they recorded and dubbed their own voices over top of Rutger Hauer speaking to Harrison Ford at the end of the movie “Blade Runner”. “I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe…”  This was all Betamax enabled.  Fast forward thirty years and with a few clicks you can find that same scene in under 10 seconds.  With a few more clicks, and the right software, Rutger Hauer can be made to sing, “What Does the Fox Say?”.  Fast forward another thirty years and your avatar from Second Life will enter any movie and interact with any scene you choose. You name it, “War Games”, “Ferris Beuller’s Day Off”, or “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”.  This is how far the on-line gaming community will have advanced the internet.  Oh yes, it will be our passion for online gaming that will turn the internet into our true second life.  At least through the creation of Ernest Cline’s first, and his (I can’t wait for the movie) best selling novel, “Ready Player One”.  It doesn’t end there.  Pick any computer game ever invented and tuck  it neatly into a consolidated worldwide virtual environment.  Inside the OASIS everything we consider to be society will be enabled.  Schools, commerce, entertainment, crime, our every need will be met.  In theory our only need outside of OASIS would be food  delivery and a functioning toilet nearby.  Add a true online quest for a $250 billion dollar prize and the ultimate game is on...Ready Player One...<br /><br />Ready Player One is a fascinating glimpse of the 1980’s that takes us 30 years into our own future asking us to go back 30 years in order to go forward.  Cline not only has an encyclopedic recollection of music, movies, computer games, and the 1980’s culture, he has a keen view of how our society  could emerge if we fail to solve some of our biggest problems with energy and the environment.  If you can envision people living in vertical trailer parks you will immediately get the idea.<br /><br />Epic in scale and as intimate as the text messages between two best friends who have never met in real life. Cline has documented several of our geek generations and invited us all to relish in our memories of music, movies, and technology, and to think about how important they will all still be in 2044...with new technology making it even easier to access everything ever recorded or printed. Throw in an absent government, a love story, the greed of an evil corporate empire, the quest for a copper, jade, and crystal key, with a touch of indentured servitude, and you will understand this book.  This is vintage future fiction.  I think Cline has invented a new genre. I’m giving it 5-Stars, and did I mention, I can’t wait for the movie.ler parks you will immediately get the idea.<br /><br />Epic in scale and as intimate as the text messages between two best friends who have never met in real life.

1905236042|5.0|TThis deck of cards is very useful when trying to do Yoga with kids. THere are pictures of kids doing the stance and that makes it motivating for my children to try to do the stance. There are also games.  The cards are larger than a deck of cards and bright and colorful and easy to use. They have fit into our homeschooling program and my children have enjoyed doing them.
B000URWYTS|5.0|A great love story and comment on the state of marriage back in the day and probably today.  No one has a perfect life even those we admire and revere in our culture.
0920668372|4.0|I think the idea of a mother sneaking into her grown son's room and rocking him while he sleeps is a bit creepy, but this book is a classic, and I bet 9 out of 10 mothers will cry at the end.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Everyone should read this very interesting account of dying.  It gives some insight into disease and makes one wonder as to whether our mental state has more to do with disease than any physical reasons.
0345511468|5.0|My husband loves this! It was a great gift for him - an uber-fan - and much more comprehensive than even he expected.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I play it on 3 different devices. Very addictive game that I can't put down. Need more lives.
0399159347|5.0|I started this book with trepidation; it looked a little too &#34;chick lit&#34; for my tastes. But my fears were unfounded. Top-notch writing and human, flawed characters make this a real page-turner. I particularly enjoyed the surprising and poignant epilogue; it added a lot to the story and really makes you think about &#34;what if.&#34; Highly recommended.
0312370849|1.0|I am entertaining myself by thinking of all the stories I would have preferred over this mishmosh:<br /><br />-- Sarah's story (all the way through):  A girl survives horrors in her native Paris, and goes on to a troubled life.<br /><br />-- Julia's story (better done):  A journalist with personal problems gets drawn into a story about a Jewish girl from long ago; gradually her obsession grows and her own life is ripped to shreds (or, possibly, remade better)<br /><br />--The policeman's story:  He had reasons for what he did.  Was he going along with the crowd?  Had his own kids to support and couldn't lose his job? terrified of being imprisoned for wartime treason if he didn't comply? Felt helpless and decided the Jews were dead anyway so he might as well save himself?  What conversations did he have with his fellow collaborators during that time?  How do people struggle to justify bad acts -- which is something we all do every day IMHO.  How does he justify himself now?  Perhaps he meets a slightly unstable French-American journalist who wants to interview him, and the two form a strange attachment.  It shatters his complacency.  Madness results?  Healing results?  Self-knowledge results?<br /><br />--The father-in-law's story:  At 12 he saw a child's corpse in his cupboard.  His father told him to keep it secret from his mother.  How horrified was he to go on living in that house and keeping that secret and sleeping in that bedroom?  What nightmarish questions did he have about his father's possible complicity in the little boy's death?<br /><br />--William's story:  As an adult, perhaps raising a child of his own, William stumbles across the diary of his long-dead mother.  She'd been a difficult and secretive woman.  He learns the truth about the past that she kept hidden - and he sees how the horror of WW2 echoed through his mother's life, and was passed on to him, and is now being passed on to his own child.<br /><br />-- The foster parents' story:  Why did they help these two Jewish runaways at the risk of their own lives?  How did they explain the sudden appearance of a new girl in their home?  How hard was it to raise her, love her, and not be able to \\"fix\\" her?  How did they deal with her emotional problems?  How have they changed because of her presence in their lives?<br /><br />The prose was so laughably bad that it was almost lovable.  My favorite quirk:  the 'exposition-by-dialogue' style used heavily in Julia's first few chapters.  Example:<br /><br />Julia:  I know nothing about the Vel d'Hiv roundup.<br />Respondent:  Oh!  Let me tell you all about that! Blah blah blah blah blah blah.....<br />Julia:  Really! Tell me more about it.  This novel's readers must be brought up to speed.  Immediately.<br />Respondent:  Certainly.  I will now help Ms. de Rosnay by expositing at length in the lamest possible way.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  Blah!<br />Julia:  Please tell the readers the answer to the following specific questions (produces list and starts ticking them off one by one)--<br />Respondent:  Yes, I will now vomit forth those answers.  Blahblahblahblahblah....<br /><br />Unlike many readers, I wasn't terribly bothered by the 'coincidence' of Sarah's home being the Tezac home.  de Rosnay was writing about sarah because she happened to be the former inhabitant of that apartment.  (It was obvious how the two stories were going to intertwine.)  Had the apartment belonged to - let's say - a Jewish pianist and her grandfather, de Rosnay would have left Sarah out and given us the pianist's story instead.  Of course, the contrivance would have only seemed natural if we could have met Julia first, and been introduced to Sarah only after Julia discovers the history of her in-laws' apartment.<br /><br />But the author had a pretty good reason for not structuring the plot that way.  She knew damn well that the chapter-one 'hook' of Sarah-in-the-roundup and Michel-in-the-cupboard was the only reason we all bought the book!

1401923119|5.0|It is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the invalidation of the standard of care in &#34;mainstream health care&#34;. The medical model has been broken for years as a way to become truly healthy. This Dr. has exceeded my expectations of what someone who taught in medical school could ever understand. He got it, then he went past anything I could have ever imagined him knowing.  Incredible man and great book.

B0035LMTZA|3.0|Could not watch when I tried because my ISP gave me crap equipment, since fixed! I had seen it before though and it is OK, not as good as the original and in some places just plain silly(driving at high speeds on the roof of some building). I also just bought a copy on DVD for five bucks a week before I could have gotten it for free just because I signed up for targettickets dot com where they give you ten free digital movies on VUDU, Awesome deal!!

B00FB029IU|5.0|This album delivered about what I thought it would and it, undoubtedly, taught Jake a few more lessons about the world of musical production.  After Rubin's attempt to capture the essence of Bugg, he gives us a Bugg-tinged album but not a Bugg album.  Jake will have to save this for himself, imo, until his third album comes out which he claims will be written only by him and will be acoustic. For that reason - I can't wait for album three.  But, because this album is still Jake Bugg and because Rick tried to capture Bugg's elusive quality, I still love it.<br />It is clear that Jake is very talented and, fortunately, a little stubborn.  If that wasn't the case this album would just be another drop in the bucket but Jake's writing and unusual melodic sense and lyrical ability still manages to creep through Ruben's limited scope.  Songs like Kitchen Table stand out.  I admit, Jake's voice is not the best for some of the productions but...there's nobody out there at the moment who is more fetching.  Buy the album.  I don't think most of you will regret it.  Bugg is going to become legend.  Then you can say you were there when it happened.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written, outstanding research and a very easy read.  I enjoyed Adam Makos' book tremendously and would recommend A Higher Call for any WW II aviation enthusiast who wishes to read about character development in lieu of aircraft performance parameters or individual statistics.  The hardware is certainly interesting but is by far a secondary consideration in this book.  I tend to enjoy (a few more or perhaps more thoroughly detailed) maps when an author is trying to geographically orient readers, but this is merely a personal preference.  This book will not disappoint.

B00FANXZL8|1.0|I haven't played any music so far, and already I am unimpressed!  Not sure whether this is a cheap knock-off of the original, but it looks tacky and unfinished.  It is virtually impossible yo distinguish what is what....and why the heck is there a blank booklet included?  I sure hope that the CDs are better than the packaging!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Great item with no problems and seems to be just what I thought it was when purchased. Would buy again if needed.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Best movie ever.  I'm not really sure what else to say.  Sure it's standard def, and there are no 3D objects flying at you, but it is still the best movie ever.  The extras are the best extras ever.  If you do not enjoy this you are a soulless shell of a human whom I never want to meet.  OK - maybe that was strong, but this is the best movie ever.

B00BSWMITK|4.0|I saw the unstoppable momentum tour, and the title track inspired me to buy the CD.  It's one of the best I've heard from Joe.  It still has the Satriani vibe, but I feel like he's pushing himself and less formulaic.  If you like instrumental rock (or Satriani), add this to your collection.  You will enjoy it.

B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I wanted to like this more.  I've been a fan for a long time, but they seem to be the John Petrucci band these days.  It sounds far too similar to the last slew of albums.  Maybe Portnoy was right & they needed a break, maybe not.  I like the new drumming, but they all feel like songs I've heard before.  I'll put it in the player once in a while, but Images, Scenes, Awake, When Dream & Day, and Change of Seasons remain far superior.  The musicianship is impressive, the songs are good, but I still feel unmoved, unlike their earlier work.

0307352153|5.0|I'm approaching retirement and I've struggled since I was five years old when I started school for an explanation of why I'm so different than the extroverts that seem to dominate the world.  They don't actually, and Susan explains why.  She provides real usable tools for an introvert to use to deal with the times that it’s essential to act like an extravert; I started using them the day after I read that chapter, and it’s amazingly easy.  All you really have to do is pretend long enough to get whatever task done that you need to do and then retreat to your Quiet self to recharge.  And there's nothing wrong with that, the best of the creative do it!  And you experiment with how long you can endure being a false extravert and respect your limit - stop when you've reached it.  With all of the experts we have, supposedly, I don't understand why I didn't have this book available to me when I was a teen in the 1960's.
0553386794|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire, better known as A Game of Thrones, has been “hailed as a classic,” despite being less than ten years old. “George R.R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.” I didn’t jump on the bandwagon immediately. In truth, I didn’t know about the books until HBO picked it up as a series. I’m so glad I discovered it.<br /><br />Imaginative fiction isn’t new and the bar has been set very high in the genre. Tolkien’s Middle Earth and C.S. Lewis’s Narnia were unparalleled until Rowling introduced us to the wizarding world. But in the background, Martin created the fictional world of A Song of Ice and Fire and his world building skills are among the best. The people and places found in A Game of Thrones are exceptional creations and the rules Martin established for guidance are extraordinary.<br /><br />I feared the multiple viewpoints would be hard to follow. But each thread stitches together a vast and fascinating patchwork story. The characters are diverse, intriguing, and at times their motives are unclear. There are those hungry for power, others who live for honor and still others forced along a path not of their choosing.<br /><br />I’m in it for the long haul now. I’m addicted and can’t wait to get my hands on the second book.
0062290797|5.0|The book was amazing to begin with. Adding what they have and having Chris's wife sign the book brings it that much closer to being human and hits home.
0062014536|5.0|I bought Requiem immediately upon its release, but for some reason I delayed reading it. I loved the first two books and was anxious to find out how Oliver would end the trilogy. Once I began reading, my reasoning became clear and hopefully I’ll be able to explain it in this review. Before I move ahead, I want to say that I truly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The surprise ending of book two, Pandemonium, was a factor in my hesitation to start reading this book. I’m not a fan of love triangles and it was evident one would be prevalent in the trilogy’s conclusion. While I found it tedious at times, it demonstrated the pitfalls that come with being allowed to make choices. Sometimes you make the wrong choices.<br /><br />Because I loved the first two books so much, I feared the third would disappoint me. At the heart of the overall story is individual freedom and with such freedoms comes really messy things. The government wants black and white, but with freedom comes shades of gray. I believe Lauren Oliver portrayed this concept exceptionally well.<br /><br />The characters grew throughout the series. Looking at them in Requiem and comparing them to their origin in Delirium is quite impressive. The story is filled with angst, the plot points are explosive and it ended as it should.<br /><br />I regret not reading this book immediately. It held my interest just as the previous two did. It’s definitely not a stand alone book. You must read Delirium and Pandemonium to understand what’s going on. Especially between the two narrators. If you’re looking for things to be tied up with a pretty bow, you won’t like the ending. If you expect to be left feeling hopeful and a little unsure, this is the perfect series for you.
0061122416|5.0|I love this book. I bought  this copy to replace mine that walked off... I don't even know how many copies of the alchemist I have bought, this one I got to read to my kids and they loved the message - there is nothing like reading the alchemist to stir up a little magic in your life - it really works!
006202406X|4.0|Placing a book on my all-time favorites list doesn’t happen every day, so telling you that the entire Divergent series has a spot on that list says a lot. It was a study in patience to wait for Allegiant to hit the bookstores. When the blurb revealed it was to be told from two points of view, I grew wary. That does not mean the book was a disappointment, but it wasn’t what I expected.<br /><br />I praise the portrayal of life as messy, confusing, ugly and beautiful. The love between Tobias and Tris goes through the normal ebbs and flows that make relationships worthwhile, worth fighting for. I commend Roth for not shying away from showing what can happen when government gains too much control.<br /><br />Veronica Roth does not disappoint. The world she created in the first book and began to dismantle in the second defies description. In Allegiant, she turns everything on its head and shakes the foundation she erected. All the elements that I loved in the first two books, the characters, the writing and the world building are still there, but...<br /><br />While I give Allegiant the highest marks, a part of me feels a bit cheated. From the beginning, it was Tris’s story to tell, but for some reason the final book is also told by Tobias. I can see the advantages of doing so, but it kind of feels like Roth took the easy way out.<br /><br />That being said, it’s an excellent finale to an incredible story and I highly recommend it.
0316228583|4.0|Not as interesting a book as many of J.K. Rowling's past editions. J. K. Rowling's books such as the Harry Potter series were very creative and enjoyable reading
B000W94FE6|3.0|I got bored halfway through the book. He paints the picture for why flow is necessary, but then spends FOREVER explaining in detail what it might look like in every possible facet of life rather than telling people how to get there, stay there, and enjoy it! I feel like he could have cut out 2/3 of the book and made it much better.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Amy Adams. Clint Eastwood are great actors. This movie is also about baseball, how the scouts find players and track them.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was fantastic. As someone who works with elderly and/or disabled people full-time, it gave me a lot of insight into the particular needs and challenges of a person with Alzheimer's Disease. Highly recommended.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It wont work for my kindle fire. Very dissapointing it only downloaded half way and I get error message. needs to be fixed.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Real STEEL is actually not that good I RELLY would rate this a 2 star because EVERYTHING IS AN IN APP PURCHASE and it dose not have multiplayer  but other wise it's ok but I'd recommend the free REAL steel over this one. Needs more stuff to.
006202406X|1.0|The last book ruined the entire series for me. I would not recommend these books; they are too depressing. The ending was not well written and did not serve a purpose. Plus, I felt like the entire last book was slightly repetitive.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I just wish you didn't have to pay such a high price so early on in the game to buy items and land
B0037VNX44|1.0|Pure rubbish!!! There is 2 hours of my life I can't take back. Whoever made this thought they were being artistic in the fashion of Clockwork Orange. Movie went on and on. No point. Just some guy who is pissed at the world. Well I'm sure there are many &#34;bronson's&#34; out there. Nothing special. I used to think Tom hardy was a good actor and now I see he is the same character in every movie. Outfits change but that's about it. Oh and another thing, Did we really have to see his &#34;stuff&#34; hanging out all the time? This movie is just ridiculous. I am so mad that others gave it high star rating. Please, Please, PLEASE, save yourselves from watching this.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Got to love this series and it's even better when you can watch them over and over again at your own convenience.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson has a knack for finding the interesting aspects of anything, and certainly 1927 gave him plenty of material.  When you combine this with his research diligence and his writing ability you have an excellent read.
B000SVZIOE|4.0|I am disappointed because i can only view this movie when I have WiFi. Can't watch it in the car or other traveling areas.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I actually like this version better then the one on Facebook. There is too much going on in the Facebook version. This one is very easy to understand and much more fun. I think the only problem I have with it is the draging to make things. Isn't easier to tap it? I don't know. I rather tap it then drag things.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Love my Dive housing for my Hero2. I know the housing that comes with the heros are good for any depth scuba can go, this housing make underwater shots so much better.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Just not the game for me. Hard for me to see whats coming up and not what I thought it was about.  Still had to try it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! Great story and turn of events. Well written and flows nicely. one of those books you keep thinking about...<br />Highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun easy game to play to pass the time.  Especially when tv stinks and there is nothing on but garbage to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who likes/loves match 3 games. The games start out easy and get harder as you progress. I don't buy lives or anything, I just wait until they refill!
B004G6009U|5.0|This is just such a great movie and is stunning on blu-ray.  I don't tire of watching it; in fact I watched it twice last night.
1451666179|5.0|This book is fun, funny, modern, and insightful. I couldn't get through it fast enough. As a dog owner, and someone who struggles with depression, Brosh found words for thoughts and feelings I can't explain. Even if you're not familiar with her blog, pick this book up for an incredibly enjoyable afternoon.
B00CHVJ4SO|4.0|This is a pretty good movie that I actually use in class for students to make connections to the stone age and the move in history from hunter-gatherers to farmers.  However, once I realized it was Nicholas Cage as Grug, I only see him as Nicholas Cage anymore and I don't like it.  I love the character that plays Thunk.  He was funny on The Office, too.
B00COO2D6O|3.0|Its a nice tower defence game, but to play well it requires in app purchasing to play to the fullest.  Fun but limited.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Too bad this has been discontinued.  I love Game of Thrones and this Blu-Ray was gorgeous.  I could not stop watching it.  In fact, I called in sick the next day and kept the marathon going.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it so much I like to just drive the dune buggy and the big truck and the 4&times;4 truck
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I order Blu-Ray Game of Thrones every year and then call in sick the day after it arrives to have my own GOT marathon.  It is the most amazing show, and the blu-ray makes it even more incredible.  I absolutely love it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This was to me a very unique way of looking at things. I highly recommend that it be read by people with an open mind.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love Kings games.  This game have problems need to be fix:  Moves from friends, I received but cannot use.  Hearts, No problem!  Unlock level gifts, I received but cannot use.

078322740X|4.0|This movie was hilarious! Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn really click and work well in the leads, and it was great from start to finish. This is a great comedy for anyone to watch, and Hawn especially is terrific. Great extras too.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Having loved, 'eat pray love' and 'Committed', I really looked forward to this one. Gilbert does not disappoint. This is an engaging story about science, women, being human, and making a meaningful life. It is rich and deep.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. The book club at school read it and although I wasn't able to read it on their time frame, I'm still glad I read it. I told my mother-in-law read it, too. She made a comment, 'people can be so cruel.' I laughed and I cried. It was a good read.
0453005071|5.0|I had these books before but I let someone else read.  Didn't get them back.  My books are like my children when they're not around<br /> I miss them.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very laggy even with computer within 6 feet of device.  Bought this to play home videos that are on my computer on the big screen tv.  That functionality has been disabled so device doesn't work for that purpose.  Even playing videos from youtube was very choppy and rendered device unusable.  Returned!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This was HUGE when it came out!  Almost too much.  I'm Glad Paul chose to re release it.  This was a remarkable record for what was left in: Richard Cory, Go Now, Soiley and other non studio album tracks, although why radio only plays Maybe I'm Amazed off this is hard to understand.  Macca did something unique with this version of Wings-he let them record their own songs (Wings at the Speed of Sound-which is also being remastered).  In 1978, wings would be down to 3 again, and after a stint as Suzy and the Redstripes, they'd release their most bubblegum album, London Town.  So, savor this.  Paul visits his old band's repertoire, what's their names, but also goes through a string of Wings hits.  After the bust in Japan, Wings came to a screeching halt.  Still waiting for those live impromptu concerts they were doing on various campuses in the early 70's.  Until then, this will do quite nicely.

B00A46H3J6|5.0|It's an impressive debut with songs that defined Pearl Jam's image and still get played on the radio and in concert today:  &#34;Alive,&#34; &#34;Jeremy,&#34; &#34;Even Flow,&#34; &#34;Black,&#34; and &#34;Once&#34; and more.
0743270754|5.0|Excellant book on The political genious of Abraham Lincoln. Even with an advanced degree in Civil War History, I even picked up a few things I did not know. The movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; is based on only a VERY small part of this book. To understand Lincoln's views on slavery throughout his life, you need to read this books as they were constantly changing. To see the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; you only get a view of Lincoln near the end of his life.
076115728X|5.0|I never thought I'd describe a children's book as beautiful, but this one just is. It was recommended to me, so I purchased it, and the second I opened it up and started looking through it, I thought &#34;wow!&#34;. It's my favorite of my daughter's books, and one of her go-to favorites too (she's 17 months now, and I know she'll enjoy it for awhile). Really solid well-done children's book. It'd make a great gift.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga returns with a creative, delicious array of tunes. Each song has a signature unique style which defies the current generation of music sounds, it breaks the rules of what is standard and breaks from the mold of a genre continually littered with the exact same songs with different names and for that reason alone Artpop is great, add in the fact that the unique sound is actually shockingly addicting and excellently sung and produced and it is even better. An absolutely amazing album, only song that is so-so to me is &#34;Swine&#34; and that is due to the fact it utilizes dubstep which I am not a fan of but I still like aspects about &#34;Swine&#34; just not the dubstep.<br /><br />Highlights are &#34;Applause&#34; &#34;Do What U Want&#34; &#34;Gypsy&#34; &#34;Dope&#34; and &#34;MANiCURE.&#34;

1623360277|5.0|From a practical standpoint this is the single most useful book on nutritional advice I have ever read. Since I first read the book a couple of years ago I have bought at least a half dozen copies for friends and family seeking a more healthful eating regimen, and the ones who have read it and followed its advice have had spectacular health results, as I did.<br /><br />Two years ago I was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (asymptomatic). I had never been overweight and had never smoked, and I had exercised regularly for decades. Nevertheless my cholesterol had remained persistently high. Within three weeks of beginning the dietary changes recommended in this book my cholesterol had dropped from 225 to 150; triglycerides from 150 to 75. Within another three weeks my waist size had dropped two full inches and it has stayed there for two years now. Ultrasound exams of my carotids suggest a substantial regression of plaque---from 20% a year and a half ago to virtually none now.<br /><br />A year ago a first cousin saw my results and embraced the McDougall eating plan as outlined in the text. He has lost over fifty pounds and has enjoyed commensurate improvements in cholesterol levels, orthopedic problems, attitude, and general health. A quick and easy read, the book convincingly debunks common myths about the nutritional value of milk, eggs, and meat and provides simple advice for following a plant-based eating regimen. I heartily recommend it. I also strongly suggest you look at Mike Anderson's \\"Eating\\" video (Third Edition) as an adjunct to McDougall's book.

B00CO52NLI|4.0|Overall, this is a pretty fun &#34;take care of the animals&#34; kind of game. You're working in a pet rescue place and your goal is to examine and take care of the animals and the end goal is to get them ready to be processed for adoption. The graphics were OK and the sound was nice. I really liked the fact that you can have up to four separate files so if you and your children (or whatever) want to play, each can have their own account in the game.<br /><br />In this free version, however, you can only care for rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. There is an option to purchase the other animals (a cost about $7 for all of them). There is a paid version of this game for $3.99, and (I think) that version has all the extra animals, so if you enjoy this game, I'd recommend to buy the paid version rather than in the free game.<br /><br />I didn't experience any issues with the game, which was nice. There are &#34;extra&#34; items (decorations) to buy with the stars you gain from achievements (like processing 5 rabbit adoptions) and that are placed automatically within the building. I noticed that you can also keep buying the items even if you run out of or don't have enough star points, which takes you into the negative. I think the game should have a stopping point with the spending, though it doesn't seem to do anything if you're in the negative (it just seems odd to be in the negative).<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who has children that love pet games and have them play around with it before looking to buy the paid version.

0385350864|5.0|This is my favorite Bridget Book!  She's funnier and sweeter in this book than the other two.  The loss of Darcy is quite sad, but I still feel that we, the readers, got a happy ending...They married and had two children.  In the bits where Bridget remembers their relationship, we see glimpses of two people who loved and cared for each other very deeply.  Even through her loss, Bridget is back out there, living life.  For all her insecurities and neurosis, she's also much more confident than she was in her 30's.  Reading this book I feel like I've had the opportunity to catch up with a long lost friend after 15 years.  She's the same, but better because life's challenges show us who we really are.  Thank you Fielding for writing another volume in the uproarious saga that is Bridget Jones.  I've been smiling since I first picked it up.

B00457X7XQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the plot of this book. It was very well written and the technical aspects and exploitation is a real consideration.<br /><br />My only concern for recommendation is the obvious continual focus on sexual descriptions. I understand it is what sells, but I thought it did not add anything to an excellent novel.
B000FC130E|4.0|Classic story with compelling characters and interesting ideas.  If you like Neil Gaiman this is definitely worth reading, but even if you're not a fan of the fantasy genre this is a satisfying read.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|We got this a week ago and my three year old has already spent an hour playing with it on three separate occasions.  She loves it.  My 20 month old also loves to play with it but needs more supervision.  We will be purchasing more like this.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best Nicholas Sparks yet!!! The characters were well developed and the reader was given time to get to know and empathize with them. The romance pushed the envelope a little more, in a good way (don't worry fans it was still sparkling clean). The ever building suspense aspect of the story was sensational, an unexpected twist for Sparks that he pulled off pretty well, if I may say so. I will not spoil it for anyone; you won't be disappointed.
B005HEEIMU|3.0|This is a review of a single episode, &#34;The Naked Time&#34;, from season 1.<br /><br />*****THIS REVIEW IS JUST FULL OF PLOT SPOILERS, FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.*****<br /><br />I want to start with disclaimers.  One, I'm a TOS fan from way back in the '70s, when I was a kid, probably ten or twelve years old or so.  I have some of the eps on DVD, but not all.  Though I am a viewer and I do like the show overall, I am not just simply in love love love with everything Trek just because it's Trek.  I think that the quality of the show is up and down -- they did good shows and they did bad ones.  So no, I'm not a Trek hater, but neither am I just simply smitten with all things Trek.<br /><br />Two, I write a less-than-glowing review of this episode because a) I think the world of Trek viewer reviews needs more contrary opinions and no more adulatory ones, and b) the story in this episode has so many things wrong with it I'd need Spock's help counting them.<br /><br />The story starts with, and revolves around, what is in my opinion the  whopper of the hour, a plot point which requires that the audience buy into a huge conceit: that Joe Tormolen, a trained officer, in the ship's Sciences Division mind you, violates hazardous materials (hazmat) protocols to scratch his nose.  I submit that the suits Tormolen and Spock are wearing during their landing are hazmat suits, for if they were to dress only for low temperatures, warm coats would do (I live in Buffalo, NY -- we know from cold and even we go out in it without  hats).  Also, it's obviously not very cold on planet Psi 2000, because Tormolen leaves the glove off and keeps working.  Without flinching, he even touches objects which have been long exposed to the conditions there.  In Buffalo in January, if you touch a piece of metal that's been outside for more than a few minutes, you know it, and you don't maintain direct contact with it if you don't really have to.  Tormolen leaves his hand on the furniture and machinery with no evident discomfort; it's plainly just not all that cold there.  So the landing party's suits aren't just for warmth, those have to be hazmat suits, and thus, Spock and Tormolen are under hazmat protocols.  This is borne out by the decontamination procedure on the transporter platform when the landing party beams back.<br /><br />From the production point of view, what kind of hazmat suits are those anyway?  They have loose hoods which enable a doofus like Tormolen to just reach up inside and scratch his nose.  The only reason I can think of for this costume design is so that the character can do this and set the story in motion.  Without Tormolen stupidly infecting himself with a careless scratch, there's no story.<br /><br />Of course when I first saw this episode when I was a small boy these things never crossed my mind, I just liked the ep because I thought Lieutenant Riley was funny.  It was only as an adult that I suddenly realized on one viewing, &#34;Wait a minute, are you kidding me?  Tormolen just takes off a glove of what is supposed to be a protective suit, scratches his nose under his protective suit, leaves the protective glove off and starts touching things, then scratches his nose again?&#34;  What happens afterward is exactly, precisely WHY people are trained in hazmat procedures -- to prevent a story like this from happening.  For a viewer to buy into Joe Tormolen's mistake is a great big giant huge enormous buy, and I don't buy it at all.  One of the show's producers, John D. F. Black, wrote this episode, and he shows a plain disregard for sense.  He decided he wanted to do a script about a disease infecting the crew and came up with a half-baked explanation for it.<br /><br />This is bad storytelling.  A story and its plot are two different things.  A story is a collection of events, told one-after-another.  A plot shows why these events must occur in the sequence they do.  The story is the events, the plot is what connects them in a cause-and-effect chain, moving the story forward.  This is because the universe works as events being causes for later events; it is a cause-and-effect universe.  Black wants us to believe in an unbelievable action as the cause for the entire rest of the story.  Without this huge buy, the rest of the story falls apart; this is the weak link in the chain.<br /><br />That's the biggest problem with this story, but there are other errors.<br /><br />Tormolen threatens Sulu and Riley with a butter knife, then stabs himself with it.  I'm no expert in these sorts of things, but it seems to me he'd need a sledgehammer to drive that thing through skin and muscle (which he obviously must have done, or would not require surgery later).  I can't imagine anyone really being able to do themselves serious abdominal injury with a butter knife.  Why then are Sulu and Riley so threatened by it?  Once again, these are military men; they've been through basic training.  Two of them should be able to easily overpower and disarm a butter-knife-wielding man, yet they stand off, wary of a weapon barely more threatening than a spoon (the only other implement on Tormolen's food tray, by the way -- what food is it that requires the use of a spoon and a knife but no fork?  For that matter, how does one use these two implements together, how would that work?  Alternately, how would one eat with a knife but no fork?  How would the cutting of food [with a butter knife, I remind] work without a fork?  Just askin'.). Butter-knife-as-weapon is the second big buy and I don't buy it either.  There is, in other words, no good reason for Tormolen to die because there's no good, plausible reason why he should be able to inflict a serious injury on himself that way.  Again, with no good cause there's no good reason for the effect.  The plot thins.  Black wrote Tormolen's death into the script because he wanted him out of the way, but we again see disregard for cause-and-effect reasoning.  This is a story without a plot.<br /><br />By the way, there's also the matter of the spray hypo: during surgery on the dying Tormolen, McCoy asks for a hypo without saying what should be in it.  Nurse Chapel hands over a hypo with which McCoy then injects his dying patient.  Then Tormolen dies.  Assuming Tormolen should even be on the table in the first place, it looks like McCoy killed Tormolen through incompetence.  Just a thought.<br /><br />There are other, smaller defects n this story.<br /><br />Kirk orders all personnel who come in contact with Sulu and Riley to be medically checked -- for something McCoy hasn't figured out how to spot yet.  With a dangerous unidentified sickness spreading among the crew, why does Kirk not already have the ship under some kind of isolation protocol to try to keep the infection from spreading?  Kirk, Spock and McCoy are all shown to be incompetent here; by now, someone (probably Kirk) should have ordered isolation procedures. It isn't until much later that Spock, not Kirk, orders &#34;Alert Baker Two&#34;. He then mentions that they are &#34;sealed off&#34; and suggests this may &#34;minimize the spread of whatever this is&#34;.  I'm glad someone thought of it.  Eventually.<br /><br />Riley got into the engine room by running in and telling the engineers Kirk wanted them on the bridge, then locked the door behind them as they left.  The entire engine-room crew, to a man, including Chief Engineer Scott, ALL left the engine room, during a crisis, because a navigator told them Kirk wanted them -- the entire engine room crew -- on the bridge.  And they left a navigator in sole control of the engine room.  During a crisis.  Dumbest.  Engineers.  Ever.<br /><br />The forced-matter implosion is deus ex machina -- it is never mentioned, never established beforehand, but is suddenly brought out with mere minutes to go.  &#34;Sure is a good thing you had that anti-head-chopping ray, Flash.  Otherwise we'd all be dead right now.&#34;<br /><br />With less than fourteen minutes remaining before the ship will crash into the planet, McCoy is still running tests on Sulu to try to figure out what's wrong with the crew -- McCoy still has no idea what the disease is or how it's transmitted, yet before the fourteen-minute deadline is up, he has a working serum literally in hand to treat it.  Another deus ex machina.<br /><br />With mere minutes of life remaining, Spock spends precious time walking, not even running, just to tell Scott to hurry up, instead of using a communicator or wall-mounted comm panel.  Dumbest. Exec. Ever.<br /><br />As they leave the briefing room Spock says to Scott that he'll call in the intermix formula from the bridge.  Then Spock is shown in the Engine Room with Scott anyway.  Why'd Black bother establishing that Spock would go to the bridge, then show him in the engine room?  He wasn't even paying attention to his own script.<br /><br />There's more, oh, so much more, but I'm getting tired of writing.  This is one of the worst scripts in the series.  Hardly any of it makes any actual sense.<br /><br />On the plus side, Bruce Hyde, as Lieutenant Kevin Riley, makes a bad story watchable.  His delightfully goofy performance never fails to bring a laugh.  If the whole episode were designed around drunken Riley it'd be the funniest hour in the series.  This episode would deserve one star, or maybe two, but Hyde's performance brings it up.<br /><br />I think it's hilarious when Sulu calls Uhura a fair maiden and she says “Sorry, neither.”  It's one of the best lines in the whole series.<br /><br />Nimoy's not a good crier.  It looks like acting, which is a sin for an actor.  Never get caught acting.<br /><br />Do we need to talk about Shatner?  He ate the briefing room set for a mid-morning snack.<br /><br />All in all, this is a badly written story with one good performance (and not enough of it) in it.<br /><br />In my opinion.  Your mileage may vary.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What I like best about his books is that it's very hard guess what's coming next, the intrigue and suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. The storyline is very interesting and believable, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys \\"down home\\" country intrigue.

B00FAIPDAE|1.0|I would have given this game 4 stars easily before today. After the recent progress wipe thanks to the current update, I wish I could give it 0 stars. Obviously your programmers missed a key part of that update, keeping a players progress intact. I've wasted my time building up a good village, and you wiped it out in an update. Since you wasted my time, I shall no longer spend anymore on it. You will lose at least half the players because of this update. So sad, this was a fun game before this BS happened. Good luck getting players to return......
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|This is a live cd and not a studio recording. It sounds as if you are at the actual concert. I attended one of the shows and this is what it sounded like. You can hear the crowd go absolutely crazy. This is a double cd with beautiful packaging (similar to the inlay of the dvd). It is a stunning reminder of one of the best live shows ever. Love Spent is absolutely gorgeous and the noise of the crowd during Like a Prayer is electric. There is no other performer like Madonna!!!!!
B005CWRB44|5.0|This flashlight is just plain awesome. There are 100 reasons you should buy this. And it is an amazing gift people will love and actually get use from.<br /><br />Let's be real...NO ONE wants to carry around a gigantic flashlight. But EVERYONE needs a flashlight to see in the dark, and by Murphy's Law, you will need a flashlight only during the worst possible timing. So having this for your key ring is great. It's small, it's reliable, it is bright as can be, and it has an adjustable light output. You can throw it on the key chain and carry it on you every day and forget you even have it...but when you need it, there is a lot of brightness and a lot of battery life.<br /><br />Like most Fenix models, the Cree LED is industry-leading, the lens gives the beam good projection, it is durable and safe for usage around water, and the cost is as reasonable as it can be. 25 bucks for a 3-way light with up to 170 lumens? That's crazy! Crazy good! Five years ago, a good quality 170 lumen flashlight was over $200 and about 4 times as long...my how times have changed.<br /><br />If you are only buying one flashlight, this is the one. This is the flashlight you will most likely carry on you and hence the one which will serve you best when you need it. And despite its small size, it has an incredibly bright output and excellent run time. So you do not have to compromise on performance. And even better, you don't have to spend an arm and a leg either...so this light is:<br />-super tiny<br />-stupid bright for any size (170 lumens is a lot)<br />-user-adjustable in output (3 different brightness levels)<br />-durable and water rated<br />-very inexpensive<br /><br />Now do you see why I say everyone should have one?

B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|In John Grisham's world, lawyers are dishonest or drunks. Yes there is always someone, usually young and idealistic who is honest and sober, but everyone else is pond scum. Same in this book. It gets old quickly.<br />Like so so many books that I read, there is a good book in here somewhere but Grisham can not get out of his own way. I doubt that any editor has the guts or power to say &#34;John, lets make this into a good story and take out the stuff that is silly and gets in the way.&#34; Had someone said that, this would have been an interesting story.<br />I gave the book 3 stars which is more than the book is entitled to. But a book about a fight about the legitimacy of a will is interesting and unusual. And if the book motivates anyone out there to get to a lawyer and write up a clear and unambiguous will which effectuates their desires, then it serves its purpose. Yes, I am a lawyer so I am in favor of people transferring their assets as THEY wish, not as the STATE rules in cases of intestacy.<br />So enough said. The book will give you a few days of OK reading. Its not good writing or a great story but there are worse ways to spend your day.

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Kay, Lucy, Benton & Marino are a great team. Very well written with great detail. You can actually visualize and imagine yourself there in the thick of it .  Dust is a powerful read in true Patricia Cornwell style. You won't be disappointed
B00A2H9P98|3.0|In “White House Down,” Channing Tatum attempts to get the job of his dreams – secret service agent in the Presidential protection detail – in what has to be the toughest job interview ever.  To prove he’s worthy of the job Channing has to battle an all-star team of American terrorists.  Making things tougher is that the man he’s protecting is Jamie Foxx.  And he has to do all this while babysitting his bratty eleven-year-old daughter who dreams of being a youtube star.

B00E9ZATJO|3.0|Mike and Will are “scaring” majors at Monster University, but from day one it’s clear that neither belong.  Mike’s problem is that he’s a monster who’s cute, which is to say he’s like a plane that’s afraid of heights (and, yes, they’ve made that movie, too).  But always the loner and loser Mike is determined, despite all his genetic flaws and defects, to prove that he can be the scariest monster of them.  And then there’s Will, who has all the genetic gifts and family heritage to become the scariest monster of them all, but he has attitude issues.  Over the course of the very long and very boring movie, the two enemies become frenemies then become reluctant friends before finally becoming the two partners that would start Monster, Inc.  And they do so not by drudging it through school – it’s clear that both are “different” and so can never belong and succeed in the rigid and stifling atmosphere of Monsters U – but by getting kicked out of school, and having the tenacity to stick to their dreams and work from the bottom up.<br /><br />That’s a really valuable lesson that American children need to understand.  But Monsters University is not meant to be a public service announcement, and as a movie it really really sucks.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You know what I think about Wonder? I THINK EVERYONE ON THE PLANET SHOULD READ IT. Yep, it was worth the all caps. Not only does R.J. Palacio do an absolutely wonderful job writing this story, it’s a heart-warming, tear-jerking and all around awesome read.<br /><br />Need more reason to read this? My friend, who isn’t a big reader, was the one who highly recommended this one. That’s right people. A non-book reader suggested this book. She’s a teacher and reads it to her students as well. It’s that kind of story. One that impacts you at any age.<br /><br />  “Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the word.” – Auggie’s Precept<br /><br />It’s mostly told through little Auggie (who I just want to hug), but there’s a few chapters that are told from other people’s perspectives. I wasn’t prepared for it at first, but it works perfectly. Plus the book is full of gems to hold on to.<br /><br />  “…but what I want you, my students, to take away from your middle-school experience,” he continued, “is the sure knowledge that, in the future you make for yourselves, anything is possible. If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary – the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, someday, may recognize in you, in every single one of you, the face of God.”<br /><br />It’s amazing that this is a debut novel. I can’t wait to see what R.J. Palacio comes out with next! I’ll probably cry in that one too. Really, read this one people!<br /><br />Have any of you read this one? What did you think? I think I need to go read it again.<br /><br />  “He is the greatest,” he finally continued, “whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.”

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I have loved the Oz books since I was 5 years old, and have a large collection.  So I'm always interested in anything Oz related.  This movie is Oz; it's far more faithful to the MGM movie than it is to the book series, and takes liberties with a history not mentioned often in any of the books, but it has the feel of the land and what makes Oz a special place.  The story told here leaves no place for Ozma, at least not as the book series placed her and her lineage.  There's plenty of room for sequels before Dorothy makes her trip to Oz, and I'm looking forward to them.  I also feel the treatment and explanation for the Wicked Witches (East and West) to be superior to that done in Wicked, a subject that was never really addressed in Baum's books.  All in all I think both Baum (who often tried to get Oz stories done on stage and screen) and Disney (who wanted to do a live action Oz film) would be pleased with this movie.  I was.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever made.  i highly recommend it to anyone who has eyesight and the means to watch it.
B00866JL96|1.0|The dvd is no good. We have tried to play it twice and we get a message of disc error. It is of no good to us at all. All of the others have been very good except Rose Marie which keeps skipping and replaying parts of it so it is of no value to us.

0525478817|5.0|I know that I am probably the last person in the country to read this book--it has actually been sitting in my TBR pile for almost a year.  I've wanted to read it--I've heard so many good things about it--but I knew I needed to wait until the month before my book club meeting where we would be discussing it.<br /><br />There was a real danger with this book--the subject of two teenagers dying of cancer could very easily go the route of the Lifetime movie.  Luckily, Green deftly directs the story so that it rings true instead of saccharine.  I will admit that I had to peak ahead to the end of the book to prepare myself (anyone who picks up this book will know that there are really only two possible endings to this story, both of which are devastating).  But, frankly, all the wonderful things I've heard about this book are true and I'm not ashamed to admit that I bawled my eyes out reading it.<br /><br />One thing that I particularly loved about this book, besides the central love story, is the relationship that Hazel has with her parents.  After all, I was reading this as a parent, not as a &#34;young adult.&#34;  I appreciated that the parents were present in this book as it would have been all too easy to relegate them to the background.  I found the relationship that Green created here to be realistic and touching and, while maybe not integral to the story, it helped to give it depth.<br /><br />If you haven't read this yet, read it now.  Really.  I mean it.  And stock up on tissues.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|STAR TREK! The reboot continues. I think this film does a great job creating some parallels to the original canon, yet stays true to the reboot and the new themes that exist within it.<br />Great job, can't wait for the next one
0307476073|1.0|This book was infuriating to read. Strayed lost her mother and after much self destructive behavior decides to hike the Pacific Crest trail. Well she doesn't really hike the trail, he hikes part of the trail in California, hitchhikes a large part of it, spends time hanging around in Oregon and eventually stops when she gets to Washington. She starts out with a pack that is grossly overloaded and in spite of help and suggestions from other hikers she continues with too much of what she doesn't really need and manages to not carry what she does need. I kept thinking-&#34;She must eventually learn what to do and what to carry&#34; But no, she never seems to get a clue and continues blunders along doing something right only occasionally by blind luck. By the time I was half way through the book I was ready to toss it. I finished it by speed reading the rest over an afternoon. An afternoon wasted.<br />Don't waste your time on this book especially if you've ever done any backpacking. Her story will make you crazy with her cluelessness.
0547391005|1.0|In every single George story, the Man with the Yellow Hat (MWYH)  tells George not to get in trouble, then he takes off and George does something stupid and gets in trouble. EVERY DAMN TIME!!! MWYH is probably the most neglectful owner/parent ever. He regularly takes off leaving George to mess other people's s*** up. He always ends up coming back when eveything is resolved. If these stories were more realistic, they would always end with MWYH either in the hospital after people beat his ass for the s*** his monkey did, or in court after being charged by the police for the wanton destruction cause by Curious little George. And now my kid wants a monkey...  End rant.
B00FAI2IUM|1.0|Game started off fun even though graphics were choppy at times. I tried to do an in-app purchase to upgrade car, but after I paid for it the purchase did not show.  Contacted Gameloft who said I needed to log-in to Facebook and complete 10 challenges for the money to show. I was also asked to provide my Wi-fi Mac address and my Facebook ID which is ridiculous. Deleting game and have reported this issue to Amazon.
B00DNNQNW0|5.0|What a great collection of songs from Katie Melua!  I have all of her music.  Her voice has matured and if anything, gotten better than ever.  I'm very pleased with this CD.<br /><br />As far as the shipping from Amazon, NOT so pleased.  The package was flimsy and when I opened the envelope, the jewel case was cracked all across the front of it.  Very unhappy as I collect the packaging along with the CD.  Amazon, beef up your packaging of single CD's.  I order a lot from Amazon and this is the first time I've had a damaged product.
B005M5OSBK|3.0|Well executed by singers with nice voices, and with lovely accompaniment, but I found the execution of traditional songs overly sentimental (although all the songs were nostalgic--perhaps that was the point).
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Probably the top 3 best Live concert sets I have ever seen!  This concert blew me away!  Especially when they act as an opening act for Def Leppard, they play jams that they normally dont EVER play!  WOW!  It also helps when you have 1000 watts of Blu-Ray surround sound and a Aquos TV...  They sound is freakin awesome!  And Joe's voice sounds pretty awesome..  A must buy!!!

B00328G4XY|5.0|Jimi Hendrix demonstrates the full range of his songwriting skills and obvious guitar playing skills. Even better are the mix of moods the man creates from joy and wonder to the depths of the blues and back up to soaring anthemic extravagances of sound.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Ridiculous, over-the-top non-stop action made perfect by Angellina's typically studied performance. She has all the physical skills to make the action entertaining. An original story, well acted and directed...
B000035P5E|5.0|Donald Sutherland is terrific in this WWII Drama.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and the ending will surprise you.
B003405MF6|4.0|Would have been 5 stars if the album was longer!.. I think Jimi H is great, but Jeff B is equally talented and original. This LP covers a lot of ground and should be played at maximum volume for best effect. This is not back-ground music, as it requires the listeners attention and is well worth the  time invested in listening to genius.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|For this price point this slide scanner has all the bells and whistles one could want. Scans slides with good resolution and is pretty quick at it too!

0992251656|5.0|A truly great game...doesn't need a lot of time to get the rules clear either, so it's pretty straightforward. Although there are a lot of pieces (cards, money, etc.), it is a necessary element to the game. I also liked the fact that there is a 'solitaire' version of the game included in the scenarios. Well worth the purchase!
B001OBT3FC|5.0|Superior performance, beautiful audio and video. Excellent photography and editing. Orchestra, conductor and soloist worked together like a well oiled machine. I am very pleased.
0316201545|5.0|This book was as good as the first book, there was humor, action and a few ghost. It made me laugh and cry a little. The only thing I didn't really like was the ending( not because it didn't end well, but it was an ending that most mothers wouldn't stand for), I sure hope there is a third book to this series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this for the first time almost 15 years ago. I hope one day I have as much self-awareness as ender does. The characters have so much depth. I couldn't put it down even knowing what would happen.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It was a good read, the stories meshed well, but it's hard to evaluate this read independently from his previous pieces. This doesn't compare to his other books, though a good, descriptive read, but falls short in comparison to his other pieces of work. His previous pieces kept me at the edge of my seat and I wasn't able to put those books down.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I absolutely love this. It's perfect! It's so much easier to manage tasks with this than the settings on my kindle. Plus, my device runs much more quickly and efficiently.
0307719774|5.0|This is so fun!  I look forward to filling it out each day.  It's got a great mix of serious and silly questions.  It's actually pretty small; it looks like a big book, but it's easily portable.  Would make  great gift.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Enjoyable and very easy to play. Only problem is Amazon is slower on updates than android but other than that it is a really fantastic game for everyone!!!!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|With all new types of special effects this one was pretty good.  It had a decent story line and watched it through without being bored.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is beautiful, and even though I never owed a horse, the movement and sound effects are as if replicating a horse in real life. I'm just astonished by the amount of detail and quality in this game. I can tell that a lot of work has gone into th i s. I'm having a great time with this game!
B005721W9O|3.0|A fairly entertaining spoof of Star Trek with Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver (who has never looked better in my opinion than she does in this flick), and other popular stars.  Some good laughs and it holds your interest well enough.  It is not fantastic, but worth a watch.  I never was a Trek fan so maybe for those that were they would like it more, or maybe they would like it less, I don't know.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is one of the truly great records of modern times (1968), without a shadow of doubt Van Morrison's best and also a MUST HAVE for any music lover I would say. I do remember being underwhelmed on the first few listens (oh so long ago) and from talking to friends over the years quite a lot of people 'don't get' just how great it is. It is an album where each track has been my favourite on the album at some point and familiarising myself with it has slowly peeled off more layers each time. It is still unfolding many years later, especially the words.<br /><br />It is actually quite difficult to classify in terms of genre but the instruments played say something. The bass is perfect, and the way the guitar is played and the vocal style are also key. There is violin, flute, and a little trumpet too, on one of the tracks. I also think the lack of drums, or at least the sparing use, is another big factor in this record's timelessness.<br /><br />Van brings a unique vocal style, and talk about singing with soul, that is what he does here - sings from the heart. The record chronicles growing up, coming of age, both looking back with a loss of innocence and forward with hope capturing that stage in life perfectly. The use of repetition in the lyrics is exemplary, no doubt influencing many other singers who followed. The last track is a heart-breaker, exposing the singer's vulnerability as he observes the girl who is 'out of reach'. I'm not sure if even Van himself could recreate this again, it was a moment caught in time.<br /><br />As a disciple of the Master, I always latch on to the spirituality of the first track with the born again theme. The lyrics: 'Got a home on high, aint nothin but a stranger in this world' I find deeply moving especially with the fantastic music as a backdrop.

B005LAIH2C|1.0|I really am sorry to have spent money on this thing.  This is the most misogynistic, chauvinistic, woman-hating movie I have ever heard of.  The &#34;action&#34; consists of the &#34;good guys&#34; gruesomely killing women.  It truly made me sick.  The writers clearly despise women in general and strong women in particular.<br /><br />I would like it so much more if they did a couple of scenes where a bunch of witches butchered members of the Hollywood writers union in particularly disgusting and horrible ways.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Such a great gadget.  Enabled us to drop our cable subscription (which was costing us $80+ per month) and use this to stream Netflix from our laptops and smartphones onto our TV.  Love it so much we bought another one for our second television.  Occasionally will have trouble loading a movie (meaning it loads up in 90 seconds instead of the usual 30) but well worth the rare hassle.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a beautifully written book. I'm so curious to read Jojo Moyes' other books now.<br />I had a secret crush on Will and wanted to be Lou's sister. It really moved me, this whole story.
B008602KQI|4.0|Interesting, intertaining and it is well depicted with excellent special effects. The idea of two people of each section brings to mind the question in my mind. What if the people that declared wars or conflicts were the one's on the field of battle that had to risk THEIR lives in order to accomplish what they believed, to decide what ideas were just and that would settle all problems? Could they then be as quick to put all the young people in jeapordy by their actions?

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game! It is a lot of fun and it is extremely addictive! I can't stop playing it!
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan has done it again! She took me into the unknown world of courtesan, Chinese culture, and history. All of this was a backdrop for the story of many women- but 3 in particular from successive generations. How many of us have  wondered who we would have become if given different circumstances ? The author's strong, yet flawed characters give us that opportunity to ponder life's unanswered questions.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's quite enjoyable though I hate waiting for certain things.. but I guess that gives me ample time to catch up on some of my other apps. I'm glad it's not as &quot;friend demanding&quot; as the one I've played on FB. It's much easier to play without having to depend on other gamers to advance.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Awesome game but you have to purchase. If you do not buy it it is not worth buying. Just like most game you can get extras buy connecting to Facebook etc.

B00902AKK4|5.0|This game is so much fun! It may look like it's for little kids but it's not. I  got it when it was a free app of the day but honestly, if I knew about it when it costed money, I would have got anyway. It's challenging and if you can't do it, it has solutions for you to watch!! Don't listen to any bad reviews, this game is awesome!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a different read for me...good but a bit 'Futuristic' for my reading taste.  I did just watch the first &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movie and it brought to life the book, for sure.  All our kids loved both book & movie!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I don't mean to be a complainer though when I say this. I just really don't get what the HUGE deal I mean, it's fun, just not REALLY REALLY fun. My friend was begging me to get this game and I refused. I was NOT going to give in. But today I saw it and I thought what the heck why not give it  try? So I got the app and now there is no way I am gonna let her know I got it!! That would mean she wins. So, back to the review. Like I said before, it's fun go ahead and give it try. Just don't get if you don't like those games where you swipe things to match them to get points, cause that is all this is.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A great book on how we can all work together to make the world a better place. Thank you for laying it out so clearly. We can do this!
1476729085|5.0|This is a really funny book. If you have ever known had an OCD kind of friend<br />who you really loved but whose behaviors were hard to understand sometimes,<br />this will seem familiar and endearing.  I also love, in a serious way, that it shows<br />how possible it is for someone &#34;Far From the Tree&#34; (another great book) to<br />find good work and good love in this life, with some understanding from others.<br />I hope it becomes a good movie and brings more understanding to more people.
1587613379|5.0|I think this is a great book to start with and to understand relationships in general, I totally recommend it.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|A concise and motivating book. Highly recommend. Very easy to grasp her philosophies and strategies. I will definitely be reading of her work.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|I consult this daily and find the answers very helpful. It is a gentle and loving oracle. I would recommend this as an excellent source for keeping in touch with your angels.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|boring so boring I use it to fall asleep. I tried to use more blah words like &#34;blah blah&#34; but it would seem the word filter did not like my blah boring word set
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great if you're my age  (under 15).  It has a lot of violence in it, so I would not recommend it to people younger than twelve. I love the way Collins writes. It is a wonderful book, packed with action.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Awesome movie. This Is one to watch two or three times to get the full grasp of the movie. If you're into S&M, you'll enjoy it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Feel in love with this novel in the 1st chapter. Would recommend it to anyone, especially a high school reading book list. Great book to discuss.
B001QWBM62|5.0|After having my Zoom H4N for almost two years, I'm still happy I purchased it.<br /><br />I am a self-produced singer/songwriter who primarily records through a Tascam 2488. However, when I want to record acoustic \\"live\\" sets, song ideas, sound effects, or audio for YouTube videos, I turn to my H4N.<br /><br />My Sony Handycam takes wonderful HD video, but the audio quality isn't quite there. So when I record a YouTube video, I press record on the Handycam, then press record on my H4N, and then CLAP so I can easily line up the H4N audio and Handycam video in Windows Movie Maker afterwards (it'd be even easier if I had a Mac and could use iMovie).<br /><br />THE PROS: MICS AND INPUTS<br />-----------------------------<br />The stereo mics on the front of the H4N are wonderful and beautifully and accurately capture just about anything you stick them in front of. Acoustic guitar, piano, the breaking waves on the beach... they all come out amazing sounding!<br /><br />The rear XLR inputs are great for going direct in with alternative mics. I actually recorded my dad's entire first album using the H4N, the stereo mics, and an Audio Technica AT4060 (listen to it at [...]<br /><br />ACCESSORIES<br />-------------<br />With some mics, going directly into the H4N with the XLR jacks is a bit too hot, but you can purchase a cheap HOSA ATT-448 Input Attenuator (pad) to help the signal. This goes in between your mic cable and the H4N and will lower the volume level of a hot mic before it goes into the H4N so the signal is more manageable and doesn't drive the H4N's inputs so hard.<br /><br />Also, if you plan to record with the H4N's stereo mics outdoors, you should definitely but a Rode Dead Kitten Windscreen. This will filter out all but the strongest of winds and is pretty crucial since the Zoom H4N's stereo mics are so sensitive.<br /><br />THE CONS<br />-----------<br />The cover for the battery compartment is super loose on my H4N and has been that way since I first opened it. It's not a huge problem, and nothing a piece of clear Scotch tape can't fix, but it's still annoying when it falls off on its own.<br /><br />And like the battery compartment cover, the snap on the clear case that comes with the H4N is also loose. In fact, I wouldn't trust carrying my H4N with ONLY this plastic case.<br /><br />What I do is this... Since I use my H4N with my Sony Handycam so often, I just keep my H4N in it's plastic case INSIDE my video camera case. :)<br /><br />The case I use is made by Targus and easily fits my Sony Handycam, my Zoom H4N inside its case, the Rode Dead Kitten Windscreen, and the AC cables for both my Handycam and H4N ... ALL inside of this one camera case.<br /><br />---<br /><br />That's it! Hope you've found this review helpful and I hope you record some beautiful sounds with your Zoom H4N.it.

B005723JSQ|2.0|I wish the story left something for the imagination. I was looking for a lite read, but just thought some surprising twists could have been added.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Started playing this game when I had pneumonia and now I'm hooked! It has good graphics and you don't feel like you wait around for hours before you can play again.
B00B9366VO|5.0|incredible story about so many artists and their lives in this storied study. A wonderful story as told by so many that had their music lives changed by the people and the place of Sound City. I also loved the base story of Nirvana adventuring to California to follow their dreams.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a blast I really enjoy it its fun trying to beat your old score I like that you can change what your minion looks like
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Some of the best rap music you'll ever hear.  Every song has verses that are just unreal.  Raw talent. Pure emotion. This man really is untouchable.
B008J34466|5.0|Another awesome CD from PINK.  If you like any of her other CD's you will love this one.  She does a terrific job with it.  I got it from Amazon for cheeper then in any store around me so that was another plus.  It arrived in great condition so this is the way to shop for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so awesome I can't wait til 0.8.0 comes out the end of November<br />I like so much that I have a tree garden it's like the real thing but on the kindle or a pocket electronic
B00ERIUO02|5.0|This is s grest CD from Katy Perry and I love it.  It is one of my favorites of hers.  I think it shows how much she has grown and it also shows how she has come through the tough times in her life.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|A very good Movie,love it,and a great book.It was great that the cd had 2 more tracks that has never before been out
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What a great movie!  If you haven't seen it you should. I have watched it several times and it is still good everytime.
0793563836|4.0|On these long winter nights I like to pull my Dean bass off the wall and learn some new things from this book.  It's clearly written and so far I'm having fun.  That's what it's about.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I love this CD and listen to it a lot.  She may be weird but she has a great voice and that is why I buy and listen to music.
1608871045|5.0|An awesome book that takes you into Nolan's bat world. Interesting details told from the point of view of Bruce Wayne/ The Batman. It's like having him guide you to take over his place as the new Bats, post TDKR. Young bat fans especially, would love this book.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I absolutly love all her songs and this CD is no different.  I play it a lot and I am very happy that I bought it.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Cool game.  Fun to do but a little boring to.  C colors and graphics are colorfully and my kid likes to play it
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I can listen to stations in my home town which I love. Although I have found a few stations that are wrong and not even in the same state, but hey nothing is perfect.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Decent game to play in order to kill time. Build your town up and farm to collect money cool game
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love this app! But it drains my battery in a heartbeat. Ended up removing it after weighing pros and cons.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Dated it may be, in an over-the-top stagey style that is Hollywood at its most excessive, but what endures over the nearly 50 years since it was made are the charm of Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, the sets and Cecil Beaton costumes, and the wit of George Bernard Shaw's original play endure.  The plot is about turning a dirty-faced flower-seller into someone who can be passed off as a lady to snobbish London society; it is really about how a dirty-faced flower-seller turns an arrogant stuffed shirt into a human, to words and music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.  The studio would not cast the original Broadway star, Julie Andrews, in the role of Eliza Doolittle. One would loved to have seen her do it, but Ms. Hepburn is awfully good, if dubbed.
B00E9A656K|5.0|i do not like the concept of the gas tank. all the rest of it is very impressive. the details of the cars are very well done.
B000002MJR|4.0|Dire Straits at its best, in a concert that captures the absolute joy of great rock and roll for both the band and the enormous audience for whose youth they provided part of the sound track.  This Walk of Life is superb, and so is this Romeo and Juliet--the hurt as palpable as the day it was written.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was amazing .The pictures were epic and the story kept me on the edge of my seat yahoo
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Beware of adware, and it didn't play very well.  I tried playing a clip from my hardrive and it was scrambled and the image stuttered constantly.  (A video that immediately played well after downloading VLC Pro..)  It may work well for others, but I hate adware and that's where I'm drawing the line and giving it a 1.
B005BC3MBQ|1.0|Would not play in my lg blue ray player..  Said it was a region free disc apparently not.  Which is a bummer
0385528787|4.0|I have been waiting ten years for Margaret Atwood’s “MaddAddam.” It is worth the wait.<br /><br />Read my full review at [...]
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Great game love how cute it is and the puzzles are fun to figure out.<br />And the monster are funny
0425263924|4.0|I loved the book... I didn't realize that I still have to wait for 4 and 5... Although I love Eva and Gideon together..<br /> Hope she doesn't have them break up... Or that Gideon gets arrested.  Can't seem to find out when the next book in the series will be out.  Don't make us wait as long as you did for is one...<br /> People will lose interest!!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|classic movie.  like actors.  maureen o'hara still alive.  knew john payne and his first daughter, julie.  went to school with julie from 7th grade to graduation from high school.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I have always liked the Eagles but did not know a lot about them. This will change that and it is well done with great clips. Highly recommend.
1878424777|5.0|Fantastic book to help you realize how easy it is to live true to yourself and others, to live in harmony with the world, to allow yourself to be yourself and allow other to be themselves. It comes from Love, it is made with Love. It is a divine gift that Don Miguel Ruiz brought to us all. Muchisimas gracias, Don Miguel!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Poorest game ever. It is okay but it could be better. It takes too long to do anything. I would get a better game if I were you.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|this is a great game i love playing it. I would recommend this game to a friend that enjoys playing board games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book I loved it leaving me hanging at the end omg great book can't wait to read next book which I am buying in about to minutes.:):):)):) :):):);):);(:(:):(: that is how I felt During the book
B00AA2I2NK|2.0|I did not care for all the other pieces. they are just too classical for me. I should have listened to the samples but did not. My fault.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think this is a great game.<br />I will recommend it to all the hunting game lovers.<br />This is the best game e I have played in as while.
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|Great family movie for the kids. The whole premise of a snail racing in the Indy 500 seems far fetched but they make it work, some good principals here about never giving up and always having a dream no matter how far fetched it may seem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't want it to end; Can't wait for the next one!!!  Sorry it is only a trilogy!  You won't be disappointed.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Wish they made more films like this one, true story and an incredible one at that. Highly recommend for any person who loves a great story told really well in this film, you do not have to be a golf fan to watch this film, just a lover of good movies.
B00C1040TO|5.0|What a nice surprise as app of the day but the normal price is totally worth it. In another life I tuned pianos for a living -- the real way, which is by ear. All instruments have their tuning quirks and machines don't adjust for this, but I will be using this for voice and it's just great for that. It even has a vibrato adjustment, and the record feature is fantastic.<br /><br />Note to people with migraines or seizures: I was initially dismayed to see the flashing screen while using the metronome but you can shut this off in the settings. Whew! And you can keep the metronome on when you turn off your display.<br /><br />Nice job AffinityBlue. I don't usually give raves but this app is a keeper!
1476727651|3.0|So I'll preface this by saying that I read and absolutely adore/love The Shinning.  The first time I read it, I had nightmares about the man in the dog suit and was grateful that there were no hedge animals anywhere in my neighborhood.<br /><br />When I first learned that Stephen King was writing a sequel for it, after so many years of letting it stand alone, to say I was skeptical would be an understatement.  Why mess with a classic by adding a sequel? For me, I felt it was done. The door the story opened, the door that opened into the Overlook led me down the hallways following Doc, Wendy, and Jack, had bee neatly closed. No lose ends. It felt finished to me.<br /><br />But like any person, my curiosity got the better of me, grabbed my hand, and I found myself buying and reading it beginning to end.<br /><br />For me, it was so-so.  Not of the same caliber as The Shining.  Everything that I loved about The Shining, the creepy atmosphere, the did-it-or-did-it-not moments that really dig in and make you look and think about what you were reading just weren't there (like Danny's analogy of being shown a picture of a scene and being told to find all the hidden people inside it, and if they catch off guard, they will kill you.  Yeah, there wasn't any of that.)<br /><br />The antagonists, The True Knot, for me, were laughable.  Dogman, creeped me out.  A group of people that have a long tooth, and travel in RVs, not so much.  Creepy dead lady in a tub and hedge animals that like to play red-light green-light, creepy.  Scary.  People in RVs that suck &#34;steam&#34;? Again, not so much.<br /><br />It was also really heavy on AA.  I understand that AA became a very big part of Dan and how he was able to move on with his life, but King really does lay it on pretty thick.<br /><br />That isn't to say that it was a terrible story.  It was okay for what it was. I read it end to end, completely through (which is why I gave it three stars). I just found myself expecting more from it because of how amazing its predecessor was.om it because of how amazing its predecessor was.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|It's supposed to work on Android 2.2 and up but I installed it on HTC Droid running Gingerbread 2.3 and it constantly crashed the phone. After the third time I had to remove the battery to reboot the phone I was forced to uninstall it. As soon as I did the phone started behaving itself again. Too bad because I really wanted to love this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it! This App does everything I need it to! Very convenient! It has nice mild great colors as a plus!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Review<br />This is a review<br />It is very blue<br />Truly very<br />Terribly blue<br />review<br />Emma,<br /><br />  Were you able to pick up the rolling pin? If not, I can head to Kroger tonight.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I'm so glad this game actually works great on my kindle fire hd! I have downloaded some games that took forever to load and some that constantly crashed but this hasn't disappointed me!
B0086700CM|3.0|This is a very good product that I will recommend if I see the need in any one else life
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far this has been a good game. I haven't put it down since I downloaded it. It works great on my Kindle Fire HD, I've had no problems thus far. The graphics are nice on this game and to be honest I can't think of anything negative for now. IT'S FREE, FUN, &amp; ENJOYABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This is a very good product that I will recommend if I see the need in any one else life
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think no wait it is awe some I love the game and every thing about it .and nothing else is like it .Alex bishop submitted this!!!
1591843065|3.0|Interesting premise and fun presentation. Only time will tell if there was any substance to what I learned from this book.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I chose this rating, because I liked the fact that Simon ended up being able to go out in to the sun even though he is a vampire. But I didn't like that Jace said he stopped having feelings for Clary and that he was going to start acting like a brother should act. I would recommend this book to everybody who likes adventure and supernatural stuff considering this book is about demon hunters, I would also recommend this book to any person that is from ages 12-99, because it is a book filled with many different types of people and so that makes this book have a lot of interesting parts to it.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Scalzi wraps up the trilogy he started with Old Man's War by proving that he can not only write good sci-fi, he can write a fun political romp as well. The voice is 100% Scalzi; at times laugh out loud funny, with fun plot twists and characters that feel like they have depth.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Fast shipping, even when it was out of stock!<br />As for the movie itself, definitely worth buying. Extended editions are always better than the theatrical and the extra features are what make the DVD worth it.<br /><br />Don't get the 2-disc DVD. pay the extra 10 bucks to get everything. it's fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Young adult fiction from the perspective of a teenage girl. Interesting plot, a quick pace, and a main character you can root for make this a quick and engaging read. Set in a dystopian future, where there exist a technologically advanced elite ruling class and a technologically backwards proletariat, the protagonist must fight for her life against forces conspiring against her. Overall, a worthwhile read, and enough to draw me into the series.
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|This is a pretty good album. I listened to it quite a few times. I enjoyed it. The bonus are great.
1451666179|4.0|If you are familiar with Allie Brosh's webcomic/blog of the same name, you will be in familiar territory here. Every bit as funny and poignant as ever, with some reused materials but plenty of new materials too.
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|This is a great album by Royce Da 5'9 and Eminem. I bought the 9 tracks cd. The last two tracks were leaked.<br />From the intro to the last track on the album is very good. Each track tells a different story.
0156465116|4.0|A delightful story for both children and adults. Antoine teaches children and reminds adults that the world can be a magical place if we use our imagination and don't take everything so seriously. This book will stay on my shelf for the day when I need to read it to a little prince or princess.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|For 40&#34; Samsung Smart TV ---- You know you bought  your smart tv and no one else in the house wants to hear your Netflix movie when you do.  Ugh.<br />So you think you'll get smart and just get a long extension cable and hook your Sony Titanium Headphones * to the Audio Out jack in the back of it ////set the &#34;sound options&#34; to external speakers (just like I did in Menu once you get to the Hub&#34;) and that will solve the problem.  But it doesn't because although you can no longer hear the tv program in the room, the sound on your head is wayyyyy too quiet.  So what you do is get this and a magnifying glass with a light on it so you can read the teeny tiny instructions that come along with it.  You charge this for 2 hours on your computer with the usb cord.  Then - take it over to your tv and put the ingoing sound into the ingoing sound side and the outgoing cord that goes to your headphones in the outgoing side.  Turn the unit on - push the thing up on the side of the little black box and hold it for 3 seconds///turn on netflix and wow great loud sound in the headphones!  Adjust the volume on the side...of the little black box.  Worked for me!!!!!!!!!
B000S1M9LY|4.0|It was...literary. While I doubt that I will ever read this again, it was definitely worth reading once. This book has probably changed how I will read every other book I ever read. At times hilarious, at others tedious. The structure was non-existent, the ending infuriating, but every sentence was deliberate.
B00GMONG90|5.0|If you're not familiar with Pentatonix, I'm almost certain that you will be amazed by their talent and that you will forget after a few minutes that they use nothing but their voices to create this music. Their music spans generations. My grandchildren love them and so do I. If you're new to Pentatonix, treat yourself and listen. If you're already a Pentaholic, what are you waiting for? Buy this immediately.
B00699SDR8|3.0|A good, brief overview of the history of western philosophy. Keeping in mind that the book's target audience is supposed to be in their early teens, the book is well written. Much of the criticism of the book is targeted at the writing, and I believe that it is unjust. If I had read this book in my teens it would have been much more relevant, and much newer. I'd recommend the book to friends or family members who are in their teens.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|It's a nice story and the acting is well done. A good family movie... Reminds me a bit of &#34;Rudy&#34;.
0307742539|4.0|A good bookend to the series. Does a satisfactory job of wrapping up the important loose ends. If you've read the first two, chances are you're going to read the third and enjoy it just as much.
8866135909|5.0|I've purchased various planners yearly since 1999, and this year I switched to the Moleskine Weekly Large.<br /><br />High quality, perfect size, and it makes me actually want to organize my life. The right-hand pages have lines that allow one to scribble down thoughts or details for meetings.<br /><br />I'll be using these from now on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game very addictive, my kids love it too.  it is  good for kids of all ages. :-)
B008ROG6E0|4.0|Ah the memories this movie brings back.  Funny how when i was younger I didn't notice how bad the miniaturized models of the city where. But I still love the concept and story line.
0143143492|5.0|An amazing book and even better in audio! Tolle's voice is clear and brings to light his important message. I definitely would recommend this to others who appreciate an audio approach to inner work.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The OUTLANDER series are my absolute favorite books!  It brilliantly captures the feeling of how people lived during that time period.  She has created a love story that will last through time. And as you read each book, you will half believe that the characters were real
B00FQMVCEA|2.0|This wasn't supposed to be a &#34;kids&#34; film. It was billed an advertised as a &#34;family&#34; film, just like every other Pixar film. Unfortunately, this film is for kids, but not all kids. This is definitely, without a doubt, the first stinker out of Pixar, and yes they know it. This thing got pushed through production as more of a buffer/money maker to compensate for the big time money loser films Disney made in this production cycle. This is a real middle finger to the people who have supported Pixar and Disney for so long. They promote this like its a big full blown production when they really knew that this was going to be a direct to DVD budget and quality film. Unlike other Disney/Pixar films, this is not enjoyable to watch for most adults, and a large amount of children. Its just boring and bland. Its like flavorless ice cream, looks good until you taste it, then its just hard to finish. Hugely disappointing, both in quality and substance, and in the way it was presented to us, the audience. The whole thing is just a lie to line their pockets while making us thing this would be another special addition to the Disney/Pixar lineup. This isn't worth renting, definitely not worth buying, and quite honestly, the best thing about it it the poster. So do yourself a favor, look at the poster, and pretend it was awesome, because thats as good as its going to get.
0375869026|5.0|This beautiful book should be in the library of every middle and high school.  The tale touches on the reservations of both parent and child approaching a new experience.  The voice of August opens the reader to empathy rather than sympathy in an exquisitely subtle manner. The read does indeed change the heart.
1564148793|5.0|Very good read. If you have problems holding an attention span with certain authors you will not with this book. It has wonderful protection recipes inside and step by step information on the things you should be doing to keep away evil and any other problamtic things going on in your life.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|it is ok but it gets boring after a while and they basically copied temple run. and you might think subway suffers is better but it is not fair because after temple run came out they knew what they were up against.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|A Perfect film, artful, truthful and real tradecraft by the director, actors, soldiers and crew.  Kathryn Bigelow made a better film than her Oscar winner.  Never been done before.<br /><br />Tim
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Leaving no Hollywood liberal boogeyman behind,, from Soldier of God, and Christian crosses on right wing racists, to EVIL defence contractors, to trasonous Republicans This POS is nothing but fantasist propaganda for DEAR LEADER OBAMA. Olympus Has Fallen may have been Die Hard goes to Washington , OK fine. This is Hollywood does a Monica on big the big screen. I can only assume James Woods really does have a brain tumour to be talked into this. Gawd I feel slimy just having watched it.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This film does its job well.  Crowe and Cotiliard give a peak performance.  Puts new clothes on an old formula and it smells great.<br /><br />Tim
B006X5L6VS|3.0|My fault - I should have done some reading - manual movement works but hold to the sky for a picture of the stars does not work with second generation Kindle.  I will install on my next non kindle android gps unit.
1476727651|5.0|Another great novel by King. All constant readers will enjoy this one immensely and I recommend it to anyone that may be considering becoming one.

B00DONF9SS|5.0|Just like the Sailor Moon figure, Sailor Mercury is excellent.  The paint job is beautiful, and the figure can pose in just about any way you want her to.  She doesn't have as many extra faces / items as Sailor Moon, but she still has a crazy amount of hands and two different computers (one open, and one closed).  The visor is a nice touch.  Her head does not tilt back as far because of her hair, but I don't find this to be much of a problem. Some people have complained about loose stands with these figures, but if that happens it is a very simple fix- you can tighten the little screws to make the arm stay in its position better.<br />I am in love with these figures, and will continue to buy any they release.  There is very little need for any other kind of Sailor Moon figure once you have these.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ok, I get everyones issue with the ending however I think it was perfect. Yes it hurts I mean dear God it's painful but it fits. I will struggle with feels for a while but it will subside. Give this book a chance and put your self in their shoes.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's a very good work out.  Level 1 is not easy, pushing through it is worth the effort.  I can tell that I am improving physically.  Once I master Level 1, I will push on to Level 2.
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith is such an inspiring writer of vivid tales of her early days in New York City living with artist Robert Mapplethorpe before they both hit it big--she as the punk poet singer and he as an acclaimed photographer. I kept expecting to read about mutual friends on the next page but our paths missed crossing by a few years. She recently accepted the Penn State Institute for the Arts and Humanities Medal for her contributions in art, music, and writing and it was a joy to hear how thrilled she was to receive the medal. Her talk, Q&A with us in the audience, and acoustic performance with Lenny Kaye prompted me to buy this book and after finishing it I bought two more of her CDs.
B001BANK32|5.0|I decided to read this book after I had seen the Stanley Kubrick movie. I felt there were a lot of things that weren't explained in the film, and so I wanted to read the original story to fill in the gaps. I definitely got what I wanted and much more. I highly recommend this, especially if you think you already know everything about The Overlook...
B00E72OKAS|4.0|It's alright, it keeps you busy that's for sure. I just would like to do the 2x after completing a area at least more than once, that's the only thing you could improve about the game.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so fun! I can't get enough of it! I highly recommend downloading this game! I would give it a ten if I could!!!
B009APMNB0|5.0|I discovered this is a very basic monitor calibrator for beginner visual artists. On my Mac, installing the software was simple and easy, and the calibrating process was breezy. As this is suitable for beginners or amateurs; it doesn’t ask to change any hardware settings, such as brightness, contrast, or gamma. And installing took about 8~9 minutes to finish. After the process, I could check the difference between before and after the calibration. And the result is satisfactory in my opinion. The positive difference is obviously visible, and I would never be able to use non-calibrated monitors anymore. Once you notice the color accuracy difference in ‘before and after’, you would see what I mean.<br />On my aged 24” cinema display which has yellow tint due to the aged bulb, calibration results tend to give me cooler temperatured tone. On my MBP display, which has less age and lit by LED, the results were warmer tones. However, when I compared two calibrated displays side by side, it was surprisingly balanced. It was hard for me to differentiate the color difference; in other words, whether I use an old monitor or a new monitor, Colormunki would most likely give me same (or close to same) results on both monitors. Another surprise from this calibrator is that it supports a dual-monitor system. Thinking this is very basic model, I didn’t expect this feature, but I was wrong. It does support two different displays simultaneously (like my setup; MBP with bigger additional monitor), and I love this feature from this basic model. Unlike my dated Spyder from Datacolor, this one also supports LED lit monitors as well as LCD ones.<br />Overall, This is a quick plug and play monitor calibrator that gives better color accuracy and consistency on the monitor than non-calibrated monitors. Even though this is a basic model, I like the results, and I found that there’s a consistency over a month of usage. Shiny brand new expensive monitors won’t give accurate colors, but this calibrator will.but this calibrator will.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really like this game. The graphics look good on my 1st gen kindle fire even on the low setting. Interface is fun and easy. Jumping between solo and multi-player is easy. I would have liked more options to earn/win crystals though. overall a must for RPG fans.

0767903854|4.0|We've been to Australia three times and while my husband has read every guide within reasonable reach about every section of that &#34;Land Down Under&#34; he hadn't read this wonderful book.  It had been recommended by friends and it was an excellent suggestion.  I purchased this used copy from Amazon and it is a great book filled with history and vignettes about a fascinating island.  This book was published in 2000, but its timeless - filled with one interesting story after another.  Bill Bryson tells stories about people, places, plants and an Aussie Prime Minister that was walking along a beach one day and plunged into the sea and was never heard from again.  Really! and this happened in 1967.  I only wish I had read this book before we visited Australia (three times).  Maybe someday we'll return and I'll be &#34;ready&#34;.

B00E0H8KAQ|5.0|Receiving a box like this is like having an early Christmas. And the first disc of the set (the latest date in recording, as they go from 1980 backwards) is a magnificent disc of music by Saint-Saens in a beautiful warm and spacious acoustic. Then comes Bruckner from Chicago, also in splendid sound, although this listener gets annoyed by Bruckner's constant repeating of musical ideas 6 or 7 times before he moves on to another idea and does the same thing again. But that's another story. I have, of course, not listened to all recordings, but the ones I have heard, including the rare \\"Segreto di Susanna\\" and the familiar \\"La Boheme\\" with Tebaldi, are quite wonderful. These discs seem to have been re-mastered for this issue as they sound better than before. I also love having the Verdi \\"Requiem\\" (Sutherland-Pavarotti) on one disc, so I can listen to it without having to change discs. A great many of the discs come with generous bonuses as fill-ups for the original LPs. As I am making my way backward through the set, I cannot help but be amazed at the constant level of recording quality. From the early 60s Decca had been my favorite company for this reason, and once again, they do not disappoint. The only thing I might wish is that there hadn't been so much music of the late 1800s and 20th Century, and more Baroque and Classical. But you can't have everything, and I am grateful to Decca for offering us this splendid overview!
B006O6F932|4.0|Im giving the school 4 stars because there are not enough class rooms! The stairs are shady and collapse easily. A future law suit just waiting to happen. You best buy the school insurance. The high rating is do to the little details! I had to buy two schools and extra lunch tables.
B00BRGL44C|5.0|These recordings have been famous since their first release on LP in 1975 and 1976. I've owned these recordings since they first appeared. They were hailed as just about the best possible and the recording quality was deemed first rate. Then came CD and we found out that the sound quality of the LPs could be improved upon by remastering for CD. And now, Blu Ray Audio. I did make an A-B comparison with the CD versions of these recordings and had both recordings run at about the same time. What a difference! I always thought the CDs were excellent and they still are. But they have to step aside for the Blu Ray disc. In the new format the overall sense of space and depth was vastly improved. Also clarity was much better than before and I could easily place the separate instruments and their place in the orchestra. No harshness of sound at any time; everything reached my listening chair in beautifully balanced sound. Together with the inspired performances themselves, this disc gives 100% satisfaction. My poor wallet! Now I have to order some other titles.
B00DH7P6WU|4.0|The Huntsman is very dashing well made, with manly clothes. Ella was a let down in that her clothes and shoes are cheaply made, not much detail for the price and her head is huge, round and super fat compared to her body. I rated it a 4 just for Hunter.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am really happy with this game and thrilled that there was finally an app for the Kindle. But I am discouraged by the glitches that I have come across already. When I accept extra moves and the moves don't show up, it is frustrating. I would think the makers of the game would have corrected this earlier since I am sure this error didn't just show up. This is a very fun game.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This story took off in directions both fantastical and real (to the fearful mind of a child). Our main character, whose name you don't learn until nearly the end, is a curious, and bookish 7 year old boy. If you enjoyed childhood heroes like Danny or Charlie Bucket (Roald Dahl characters), and can appreciate a good suspense build &aacute; la Stephen King, READ this book!  Looking forward to reading more from Neil Gaiman and seeing where the road leads!

B00E3DC2EW|4.0|Good classical book. I read it for a class and enjoyed it but as we discussed it the lack of page numbers made following along in class difficult at times. Fortunately the chapters were short.
B005HCI72O|4.0|This is the least enjoyable book so far but also the most emotional. Stories from books very rarely make me cry but I did in this one...no spoilers here, you will learn for yourself which part I mean. DG has an amazing ability to exploit ones sensory journey through her stories but I do get slightly frustrated with the overdone explain actions of things...do I really need a long description of how a creek swirled or a tree swayed...all that aside I am thoroughly enjoying the continuation of Claire and Jamie. Theirs is a passionate story that will stay with me a long time to come.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This is the scariest movie I've ever seen and I've seen just about all of them from Texas chainsaw massacre to the exorcist, Halloween, Friday the 13th, hell raiser, jaws, night of the living dead, the ring, evil dead, the others, wolfman, cabin fever, scream, I know what you did last summer, last house on the left, house of wax, child's play, a nightmare on elm street, poltergeist, sinister, the grudge etc...this one wins hands down.<br /><br />This movie made me jump and my friend scream in the theatre. For. Anyone who is looking for a great movie I would definitely recommend this movie.
0061438294|3.0|Thisw book has many good points if you are looking to read people.<br />That said i did not find it valid in many situations. Nothing should be taken at face value<br />Stay out of judgement and into Couriosity.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I know it was free, but I think I would have rather paid for it, rather than pay to advance to each section.  This is a long game and I wonder how much I will end  up spending.

B00ADQPB50|5.0|A masterpiece. Much better than the first season and a stellar performance by Jessica Lange as Sister Jude. The Story covered a lot of ground which gave the actors a lot to play with and everybody (even the tiniest bit player) gave their best. It grabs you by your throat within the first 5 minutes and doesn´t let you go until the end credits of the last episode are rolling. I can´t wait for Season 3 and 4. Keep it on lads.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is the cord that connects your Kindle Fire to the 9 watt power fast charger...or...you can use this cord to connect your Kindle Fire to your computer. You can transfer files this way or even charge it. Its a &#34;wirey&#34; cord not very pliable but I don't think that's a minus.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Short and hypnotic. It has that feeling of a child trying to find his way in the mundane world, but more than that it's the story of an adult who needs to remember what it was like being a child, special friendships and the important lesson he learned at The Ocean at the End of the Lane. This is a fantasy novel with adult themes told in a unique voice. The story stays with you and makes you contemplate your own reality. This was my first experience of Neil Gaiman's work and I'm very glad I read it.

We are implementing the necessary changes to enjoy a healthier and fuller life.  To me an important definition of success is to have a positive impact or influence on the lives of others.  Your work has made you very successful.  BTW I first heard of your work on Rush Limbaugh.<br />Thanks George

0439023513|3.0|What’s my recipe for a delicious read? One part blood sport, two parts love and a zesty pinch of character development, that’s what! Sprinkle in some of the most strikingly named characters since my very own General Maddoxton and you’ve got yourself one savory pot of literary fondue. Katniss Everdeen. Peeta Mellerk. Haymitch Abernathy. Caesar Flickermann. Effie Trinket. The great Emeril Lagasse himself doesn’t make Louisiana gumbo this spicy.<br /><br />Now you dear readers, might be saying to yourself: Eric Jonrosh, warrior-poet and author of the sweeping epic “The Spoils of Babylon,” set to air on IFC this very January 9th—doesn’t “The Hunger Games” series read much like your off-Broadway musical “The Famine Fiasco” sounded? Admittedly, it does. But who hasn’t written a tale or twelve about doe-eyed adolescents forced to hunt one another in a bloody attempt to satisfy the murderous ambitions of an apocalyptic future society?

B008D19WBQ|1.0|I can't love \\"Friends\\" more than I do.  I own the DVD version of the Complete Series (all 10 seasons).  In this Blu-ray version, they have cut out the extended scenes.  The most hilarious parts of scenes are missing all together!  Not just a little.  A LOT!  I am totally disappointed.  They MUST redo the Blu-ray version to include all the extended scenes included in the DVD version.  This was an awful decision!!!  Horrible!  Warner Bros. what were you thinking?  You really botched this one!

B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I gave the book 4 stars because the beginning for me was a little bit difficult because of the insertion of the fan fiction.  Never had read something like this.  The characters were very real and life like and well developed.  I was upset with Wren also for her decision (won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book yet!).  This book was my escape from my overworked, busy life because I really, really liked Cath.  Rainbow Rowell did a marvelous job with all the characters in the book.  I downloaded it with an attitude of \\"what the heck, I will read it eventually\\" and really fell in love with the darned thing!  I recommend this book.  I think it would make a great book club choice.  Lots of good things can be discussed.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Key element of the first movie was Boo being so cute. But children were poison and scared the big bad monsters.  The lesson here was Skully was the big bad monster, but did not even try to in school. Mike worked very hard, but was not scary. And Mike saved the day. The artistic and entertaining skill of Pixar makes them my favorite.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing read!<br />Great ending to an intriguing and trilogy... can't wait for the movie to come out!! Would recommend the series to anyone who enjoyed &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;
0679805273|5.0|One of my favorite books by Dr. Suess.  Its a great life lesson! great for any age young and old.
B00C1040TO|1.0|No microphone on Fire so recording useless. Won't play sounds at all - turned volume up full in app &amp; on Kindle prefs -  so Tuner useless. Metronome won't flash screen when that option on - so useless.<br />Wow lots of great features - too bad none of them work!<br /><br />Hope dev fixes on original Fire.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved this book!  I didn't want to put it down.  Tons of twists and turns that made you say &#34;I didn't see that coming&#34;!
030758836X|3.0|I did not read any reviews of the novel until I had read about 20 percent of it.  Then I read some while my Kindle was charging.  Many of the other reviewers, all rating the book between one and five stars make valid points.  I rate the novel a 3 .5.  It is extremely well written.  Some people said it's over-written but the protagonists are both writers so that's to be expected.  I really enjoyed the  prose.  A number of people had issues with the two points of view, alternating chapters.  I thought it was a perfect vehicle in which to tell the story since the story revolved around the twisted lives of these two individuals.  People had trouble with the fact none of the characters (perhaps with the exception of Boney) were all that likeable (I know some liked  Nick sister, Go but I wasn't crazy about her).  That is usually an issue for me as well but in noir novel like this, I didn't need someone likeable.  The characters pretty much got what was coming to them.  I wonder if what bothered so many readers is that so many people do act a tiny bit like the characters in the novel.  Lots of young women try to be the \\"cool girl\\".  Certainly not tot the extreme that Amy did but it's common.  We all put our best foot forward in a relationship; most of us just aren't sociopaths as well.  Many men I have known act like Nick, tell lies to make themsleves look better, to avoid conflict or hurting people's feelings.  And many people are indeed selfish.  The author took the worst qualities in people, ones that usually don't exist in every single one of us all the time, magnified them the Nth degree, gave them all to the protagonists and it made a lot of readers uncomfortable.  That said, I found most of the story fascinating but think that it dragged on too long. There is also a lot of vulgarity and graphic sexual content.  There were a number of glaring holes in the \\"wrap up\\" that I won't elaborate upon so there is no spoiler alert. It was extremely inconsistent though because everything was so flawlessly planned in the first 3/4 of the novel.  Some people hated the ending.  I didn't.  Someone else suggested that the last 25 pages or so should have been excluded, we should have been left guessing entirely or awaited a sequel.  That might have worked better. Th ending was too rushed but it was not horrible not completely anti-climatic.  Read it, check it out of the library as I did.  I will watch the movie and doubt the ending  will be similar.everything was so flawlessly planned in the first 3/4 of the novel.  Some people hated the ending.  I didn't.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Only negative is it needs more rooms!  Solved all rooms way too quickly.  Very addicting and frustrating all rolled into one.
B00756GRUE|5.0|The watch is absolutely precise. Being solar makes it a very reliable watch.<br />It's strong and rough. A little heavy.

I encourage anyone looking at this to check out her YouTube videos, they are well done and showcase her work wonderfully.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was a little hesitant going into this book.  I wasn't sure if I was going to be disappointed or not.  Second books and movies can often let you down, but this was actually better for me than the first book.  It really got into the meat of the story, like the &#34;why&#34; about it all. I would recommend to anyone that read the first book to go ahead and jump in and read book 2, you won't regret it.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My 3 year old grand daughter just got the movie. I am sure she will love it as she loves anything Disney with Sofia the First. Nice touch putting the stickers in with the movie. Kids love that stuff.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Excellent, excellent flick.  Great writing (follows the book for the most part), superb acting, well directed.  This movie captures the joy, freedom, angst, and pain that is high school.  On par with the Breakfast Club for what that movie did for the generation.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|I have two conflicting views on this app:    Pro:  - the app is great if you have a little floor space, a mat, and 20 minutes to sweat (preferably with shower right after)  - it tells you what to do, somewhat balances the types of exercises by randomly selecting from the different types  - has enough exercises that you can do it every day or every other day and not feel like you're overtraining    Con:  - I got this app as a FAOTD and I have not updated it, thought it was very poorly programmed and obviously had tons of room for small simple improvements, but the basic idea was great so I thought this would easily be done  - from what I see of the \\"updates\\" they fixed none of the annoying things and added a ton of other annoyances including:  - an ad platform (not something I want if I'm paying for something, they can choose to display ads at some point in the future!)  - permissions that go too far (this should need practically no permissions, it's basically a video player!)  - and they didn't fix the s***ty programming and layout (probably because it's ported directly from the iCrap)  - in-app purchases for stretching? Get lost.    I liked this app in it's initial form but someone came along and totally ruined it. If you can get an old version, you're good. I was going to recommend my girlfriend buy this app, but there is no way I would say that now. I hope someone else can do the same idea but without all the BS.    These guys missed out on a real purchase here by being scummy. Maybe they can just post the old version for sale again, I'd tell my girlfriend to buy it then.
0316067601|5.0|An amazing true story.  Well written, a moving account of Operation Redwing which involved a small contingent of Navy Seals on a recon mission in Afghanistan.  One cannot help but be left with a sense of pride, and gratitude after reading this book.  Rec'd shipment on time, and was packed very well.
B0012QTT4O|4.0|I’m several years late to the Breaking Bad party, and I just got on the train by watching Season One.  The acting is very good and you really get sucked into the story.  Despite being such a bad topic – person turning to drugs for money, the associated destroying of lives, etc. – you find yourself rooting for the new drug dealer.  The series is engaging and I am off to order Season Two.<br /><br />Rather than a DVD, I purchased the season via the Video on Demand and have watched it on both my TV and Kindle Fire.  I really like the portability vs. having to have a DVD player!
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|I suppose I enjoy movies that break your heart, or at least remind you of how it felt when you had your own heart broken.  Well written, funny, well acted, and well paced, this flick is worth a rental or a purchase on the cheap.  Good soundtrack, too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I resisted as long as I could despite the peer pressure, but I will have to say this is one of the most addictive games I have played in a long time – think of Bejeweled Blitz on steroids.  Seeing how your doing vs. your friends’ progress is very engaging. If you like puzzle-type games, I’d recommend this one but watch out – while this game is free to download and initially play, you will be sorely tempted to purchase extra moves, hammers, lives, etc. and the 99 cents to $1.99 each will start to add up!
0847842134|5.0|Fantastic book that you can stare at for days - your friends will be green with envy. Excellent edition: Outstanding print quality, wonderful paper. Just buy it before it goes out of print again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had to have this book the minute I knew that it was the sequel to The Shinning. It is a vert good read, but if you are expecting the intenisity of horror in the Shinning, you will be disappointed.  If you read it more like a stand alone novel you will love it.  I enjoyed it immencely after I realized it was not going to be an immediate sequel to the Shinning. This story occurs many years later after Danny is a man. and has a completely different character set. Read it, you will like. Enjoy!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|It is my son's favorite movie (for the time being) and I still enjoy it.  That's why I opted to purchase instead of rent.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It was an absolute honor to read this book and learn of the heroes who are our Seals.  If there were ever superheroes in our world today these guys are it.  I hope and pray that my 2 sons are able to show grow up and display at least a small amount of their courage and commitment.  This book is a glimpse into the challenges and tribulations our Armed Service Personnel encounter.  Their unwavering attitude and selflessness is beyond admirable.  Thank you Marcus Luttrell for sharing your story and letting us know what kind of people your friends were.  Godspeed.

B00BQ4NLC8|3.0|The story has a cheesy ending. A little bit too moralistic, in the end it replicates Lex Talionis ( law of retaliation).
0553582011|4.0|Very nice book, although not as riveting as the others in the saga, except &#34;Feast for Crows&#34; which was not so good. The best so far from George R. R. Martin is undoubtedly &#34;Storm of Swords&#34;

B00A6PD9I4|1.0|This film has good computer generated animation, and that is about all I can say. My grand kids noticed the same thing that I did, that the main character was a brat. No! I did not lead them into that conclusion. But when the main character gives her mother a drug, that does not seem like good entertainment for children. If I had read about this, I would not have rented it.

B00CO8TBR4|5.0|Great processor for the price. I need to build a high-end computer for some specialized software. This processor really gets the job done. It was affordable, but very powerful. Intel continues to keep my as a loyal customer.
B008M721MS|5.0|Wonderful app! I love being able to keep in touch with family and friends with Skype and this app for the Kindle is great because it doesnt require the user to have a laptop.Easy install and set up!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|At over 700 pages it isn't a quick read, but GRRM does a great job of making an already excellent story even better. The characters are getting more complex by the end of this book, struggling with real moral dilemmas.<br /><br />Something very interesting I have noticed as a watcher of the TV series is how this book starts to diverge from the first one. I won't go into detail because of spoilers.  However, I understand why HBO is doing it the way they are at this point in time.  There just is too much story to tell.<br /><br />Great book, definitely worth your time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy app to use, great app to have right at your fingertips. Would recommend for crafter and any Kindle user!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was very good, it was recommended from a friend, I will take her advise again! The story is a different perspective to time spent in the prison system, Great read!

B00G70K1HY|4.0|Wow!  This is just a review of the difference brought by the Extended cut.  Let me just make one thing clear, there's no version of Wolverine that's acceptable for children.  I don't know why Hollywood even tries.  A PG-13 berserker killer is still a berserker killer.  With that said, this extended version has more cussing.  I'm talking F-bombs and S-bombs here.  The violence is turned up to the point where Wolverine stabs one of the Yakuza and his blood (or guts) splatter onto the screen (Yes!).  There are other scenes with blood in them that I didn't notice in the theatrical version, but nothing too gory except maybe for the ninja scene.  Speaking of which, there's a a whole scene with the ninjas that was cut out of the theatrical cut that is so deliciously bloody and violent that it reminded me of Sceptic Avenger, only with blood (Saints Row 2 fans will know the reference).  If you're a Wolverine fan, don't even bother with the PG-13 version.  What's the point?  This guy is a killer and you came to see what he does best, but what he does isn't very nice.<br /><br />I still have to drop a star for the stupid robot, that worthless mutant called Viper (in name only), and the apparent continuity flaw in that Wolverine appears to have memories from World War II.  As far as I remember, everything from at least the weapon X program and back is a blank.  It could be argued that him visiting Nagasaki jogged his memory of his time there, but he has a memory of this on the way to Japan as he looks out the window of the plane.  Very confusing and annoying.  Also, there's no mention of the mutant cure from X3, which is ridiculous considering why Wolverine is brought to Japan in the first place (before the truth is revealed).  Wolverine acts like removing mutant power is impossible.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like the games and will play tell I get finish .Love love it and you will love it to.
1567184855|4.0|Again ... haven't finished reading the book ... but first impression is a good one. I seem to think I will be grateful for this information
B004JRVQX0|3.0|It comes in more handy as my night light. I'll need it eventually, but for now not so much. Yay
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It takes great talent for an author to paint a movie in your mind. Describing the setting and feeling of the time, most of which is no trouble to evoke based on the many experiences we have as humans. But to evoke a completely unknowable situation and paint it in such vivid strokes is EXCEPTIONAL. All the characters were well fleshed out, the scenes well described but not overly so. So suspenseful that I found it extremely difficult to put down! Forget that this was originally several books begun with a short story, it reads like a planned novel. I am going to continue to read everything this author has out, I am in literary LOVE.Show Less
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I highly recommend you to read this book!!!!<br />It puts life in a whole new prospective and helps you when you need help most!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far the game is pretty good but also a little slow. Need to get lots of things to make other things, but good for a few minutes at a time.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is overall awesome but I don't like how you can only get one of something before you have to use crowns to buy another one.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|A nice heist movie, good character interaction, if not deep. And who doesn't like Alfred, er make that Michael Caine.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works perfectly fine, can walk around the house and listen to music or podcasts freely. Quite long battery time. The only bad thing is that they are a bit too big for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|held off playing candy crush as all I heard was how addictive it was. well now I know why. it looks like a simple game but there is a lot of puzzle solving and strategy involved.
0385349947|3.0|Almost everything about the book is perfect except its irregularity of each page, which have me a little hard time to read it. .
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is great TV!  A couple of episodes in the 2nd season had some dead people showing up ... maybe Amazon has the episodes out of order?  But a fabulous show anyway.  John Noble is absolutely fantastic, what an actor!
B00AGE5P0U|3.0|The title and cover of this movie say it all: an intriguing sexy seductress who uses her mates only to the kill them in the end. But, like any crime thriller, the story is in catching the killer without getting tangled in the many webs of seduction and deceit. Given this general plot summary you are immediately drawn into the multiple identities of Russell and the stop at nothing, sassy Winger. The plot is kind of fun to follow, the dialogue is just below mediocre, the acting is meh (at best) but I can’t quite put my finger on why I couldn’t turn it off. If you decide to watch this movie, keep your expectations low!
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|This game has great graphics and is very fun to play.<br /> Game is not mindless tapping. Would reccomend it to any age group.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Lots of puzzles for free and 4 different difficulties to complete them with. The music makes it relaxing. My favorite puzzles are definitely the animal ones
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game! It was interesting and kept my attention. The game was well designed! I will play it again.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|I bought this product and plugged this charger to the port of my car, it hasn't fit into it. It's just waste of my money.
B00BKBCF38|1.0|By far one of the WORST bands I have ever heard. The songs are slow and boring and sound more like something you would hear at a circus or a freakshow (how is even considered &#34;Metal&#34; again?) The lyrics are hard to comprehend because the instrumental audio isn't balanced right against the vocals. All in all, this band seems more like a perfect fit for druggies looking to have some crazy music playing while they get their fix.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love love love love love!!!  Get this game.  Me and my 8 yr old play and we both think it is so much fun.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Need more apps! Hardware is nothing without apps. although this is my second purchase, functionality is very limited. My Apple frfiends are laughing.
0345803507|5.0|Wow!!!!  I couldn't believe all these things were possible.  One would have to be double jointed for some.  Wish I were younger!!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun... but you need to expand fast and the investment points required are hard to accumulate especially when you need them to take down hills as well.
1427229201|5.0|I was first introduced to the Harry Clifton Chronicles through my local library.  Audio books have become a part of my daily commuting time and I am thoroughly entertained with Jeffrey Archer's style of writing!  Mr. Archer has an engaging style and has yet again succeeded at building up the suspense as we await for his next book!!!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|So overly detailed I stopped & started reading it until I finally gave up. Clearly the author has done very in-depth research for this novel and she lets you know it by her overwrought descriptions that bog down the plot and movement of the story. Good but super slow build for the romance of the hero and heroine. Can't pick it up again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app and tons of fun... classic simple skill games... a blast to burn some time... kids really like it...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|SO ENGAGING! I loved this novel and read it quickly because the world Morgenstern creates is so fascinating and detailed that I felt like I was there. Seriously would visit this world if it was real. Loved the magic, romance, conflicts, and imagination.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Series is great. Although the shipping was done very good and on time but like others I have some beefs with the set itself. The discs are jammed in their sleeves and like everyone else I hope they aren't scratched or damaged but time will tell as it will take some time to get thru the 62 discs. But I was lucky to get them at the one day only cost of $114.00 and you can't go wrong with that.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My God this is fun but needs more lives to play with can't put down game until tablet is dead
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Once again. it always feels like christmas when ordering from Amazon. My night home coming from work was a weight lifter when this blu ray came to my mail chute.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved reliving life with Tom. Such a peaceful and fun time...wonderful<br />classic book. Should be reread by all. It is delightful.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is much more fun than I thought it would be. It's extremely easy yet entertaining. The graphics are pretty good as well. I recommend it for all ages.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minon rush it is awesome. It is like Temple Run but BETTER! I love it I love it I love it, and I love it
B00475V2CE|4.0|It was a cute movie and kept me entertained...plus, I really like Lindsay Lohan and was looking for her movies
B00CE5C8RW|5.0|love it very nice indeed.looks great and this is my first automatic but it is not a true tourbillon, great watch.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Awesome read! the story was very captivating although I was able to guess the secret before it was actually revealed. None the less I would definitely recommend it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game my son loves it... It's str8 you still have to buy stuff though but it's ok for a 9 year old kid
B00FMAZ49U|5.0|The ultra crystal screen protector is of excellent build quality with excellent adhesive properties unlike many others one can find on amazon.<br /><br />The screen protector was a bit sticky upon installation but after a few usages it become extremely smooth and glass-like as can be expected from a high quality screen protector. No change in screen quality and responsiveness can be detected even though the front facing camera and sensors are covered (no cut outs for them) everything works well.<br /><br />Quality product and the reason why i exclusively purchase Ultra Crystals for my devices if it's available.
B0033AI41G|5.0|I love movies directed by Ron Howard and this is a very good film. It is based on actual true things but I am sure it isn't completely accurate. This guy was a genius but did suffer from several mental illnesses. If you are ill, it doesn't make you dumb.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I love Stephen King, but this book seemed to drag on and on, then the ending came and it seemed rushed. I liked hearing how Danny has coped and like the fact he cleaned himself up to help the girl. But maybe next time don't drag it on and on.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I recently bought this to edit PP slides previously created on my PC.  I had purchased this over a year ago for my android cell phone and had been able to edit PP and Word files on my phone, so I thought this would work fine on my Kindle Fire.  WRONG!  All I can do on my Fire is open a PowerPoint slide and view it.  Forget about editing any existing text on a PowerPoint slide.<br /><br />While I can edit a previously-created (on my PC) Word.doc file that I've synced to my Kindle Fire with Sugarsync or Dropbox, it is impossible for me to make simple text changes to a PowerPoint slide.  I don't understand how this funtionality is available on my cellphone but not on my Kindle Fire.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|The app seems to work great, having the timer feature helps out a lot when trying to take pics of things other than yourself. I also like the idea of having the photo editor attached
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|My kids recommended this movie to me. I was skeptical, but it is now my all time favorite!  Love the music. Love the storyline. Love the characters!
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Excellent audio production great video production represents the album extremely well. As a musician I appreciate this studio album and the impact that it had on popular music. Having never had the chance to see the band live this video was welcomed. I was very close to just popping in the car and driving from Indiana time Nevada to see this but it just wasn't in the cards for me. Was very happy to see that they put it to DVD. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. All the hits are there of course. They perform the home front to back. But some of the highlights for me or some of the lesser-known twos like excitable. Life performance combined with the stage production is simply awesome.
B008Y212PI|4.0|good game makes you think<br />starts out simple but gets progressively harder<br />having three strikes make you stop and<br />think through your moves
1878424319|5.0|I read this book over 10 years ago, and then again, last year.  The principles and practices of the Toltec are amazing and if you can adhere to them, your &#34;truth&#34;, your authentic-self, will appear quickly.  It isn't easy however, but we all know the truth I believe and when you read this book, you might come away with some surprising truths you were unaware of.
B008H08XW2|3.0|I bought for my 15 yr old step-daughter that we just meet for the first time. It was Christmas so I didnt want to leave her out
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this for one thing only, the ability to mirror the page i was browsing on my laptop to my tv. That feature was introduced as a beta feature but it worked great for my needs. Whenever I saw a webpage that I had to share I would just cast it on the screen. If its a youtube video it often will use the native youtube player instead of casting the page (although sometimes it casts the page playing the youtube video). It even worked for watcing hulu on my tv. However this feature is heavily dependant on how powerfull your computer is that is casting. So for example when I use the chromebook to cast hulu, it is laggy and jumps and you cannot watch anything. When I use my laptop with 6gb ram, quad core processor and an ssd installed I can stream hulu...however even on that I have to make sure that no other app is running in the background.<br /><br />I power it from the service usb port on my tv and do not need to plug it into an outlet.<br /><br />They are adding more apps to the list (like i heard hbo go is on it now..and I really want an amazon vod app for it) so it can on ly get better.<br /><br />I didnt really need the netflix app since everything nowadays comes with netflix on it (ps3, xbox, bluray players, google tv boxes, roku, smart tvs and more). Pretty much everything has netflix on it so that was just there...Im gussing next gen toasters will come with netflix on them so you can watcha  show while your toast is being made.<br /><br />I bought this when it first came out so I got the 3 months free netflix (worth 24 dollars) making this a great device for 11 bucks but I would even buy this at 35. It is worth it for streaming all sorts of things.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addicting game. Even the younger kids love it. So this is a good family challenge game also.
B000X9UCEW|5.0|Love this CD and had misplaced my original. This one is even better with an extra CD added. thank you for such wonderful recording of a fine musician.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|I have to say that I started watching this movie without expecting anything special. I was just looking for some mindless entertainment, and that is exactly what I got; in spades! I can see how many people are upset by the political propaganda exposed here, but I am basically putting that aside and focusing on the action / adventure aspects.<br /><br />The plot may be a little hard to believe, and there are some logic flaws here and there, but what action movie does not have those nowadays. I am pretty used to that, so as long as I get a film that keeps me entertained, it has done its job. This one definitely did that. I was worried with it being so long, but I have to say that I had so much fun it actually fell short.<br /><br />Both Tatum and Fox do a very decent job with their performances, as does James Woods. The action scenes are well made and the stage of the White House provides an exciting environment for the explosive developments. There is plenty of suspense to go around and even some comedic moments. I would say that those people that liked Die Hard and are not bothered by the left / right political aspects of the movie, should have a very good time watching this.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice is a great book, a total mindgasm, you're never sure exactly what's going to happen next. I found myself completely drawn in to this story of mystery, intrigue, conspiracies, mental breakdowns, and sadistic plots. Dana is the main character and unlikely hero. Typical because of her stay as a psych patient it adds another interesting event to the story.  You'll love this book. Two thumbs up!
B004IE9REE|5.0|Great read!  This is a great help finding my next Signature perfume. This book is so informative and entertaining. Can't wait to go shopping.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|so long since I have read great writing like this. imagine if this were true? if everything we have had to end so we can live again? It takes a great mind to make what we live into what we would hate and what we fear most into what we wish to embrace.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Doesn't really work i just want a pink background<br />Can't get video to work with angry app maybe my kindle just sucks
B00005NTN5|5.0|Love this movie!  Replacing my VHS copy.  Well done & different & reminds me of the film noir - my favorite kind of film.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun, but hard to get energy for your horse. I'm partly doing this review since it bribed me. Graphics are good, and controls are easy. :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|challenging but good. it takes time to get used to finger controls. but it is also fun to play. recommended
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z is an amazing book. Max Brooks somehow manages to make you fell suspense as if you are enduring the zombie apocalypse yourself! I had been eager to read this and when I got it in my hands I simply could not put it down. The events sound so realistic it's as if I am reading it out of the news paper. I was in awe of the diverse characters and horrific experiences each and everyone of them had to endure. While I was reading this book, I could picture everything as I was watching it. Truly amazing.
B000002WYT|5.0|I finally have my own copy. I only had a copy of it previously. This is my favorite album of DMB.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun and wildly addictive. It even got my wife, firmly anti video games, addicted quite well. Fun for my whole family.
B00GSEDTIM|2.0|I want to like this, I really do. I grew up with Marvel comics when they were 25 cents and less. This show, man this show. Colson's character isn't strong. I feel like I'm watching a USA Network version of CSI Marvel. One cameo of Fury, nothing else.  It's hollow, the two best characters are the scientists. The \\"me\\" generation hacker chick, come on... Someone please take the helm on this thing and deliver some real content.  I'm actually upset I spent money on the whole season.  Colson hasn't even driven the damn Corvette but once.  S*** give me something for Christ's sake. No way I'm renewing if this crap bonanza keeps going, no way.  If this was a pile of s*** it wouldn't even stink.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|One of Tom Hanks best movies about a stranded FedEx employee. I liked it and really enjoy the plot and character developement of Tom Hanks
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Sheryl Crow sings from the heart about how a lot of us live.  You won't be disappointed with this CD.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|After having played the first CastleVille on Facebook. I was excited to see this available for the Kindle! So far this is really fun and engaging.
0977476049|5.0|It was good to get a modern version with explanation of some words and phrases from that period. My reason for buying was to get some sort of understanding of why things went they way they did...how people could support a maniac, and Hitler was that when you listen to some of his speeches, his notion of 1000 year Reich and even ruling heaven. However the discs are good value and there are some interesting info on them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun for all.  You have to try it just might like it.  Sweetest game I know and looks good .
B003IHWLL8|4.0|This was interesting because it's based on a true story.  The two me are remote viewers who can foresee the future. It show the power do our thoughts. I enjoyed it I thought the movie was funny.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a match 3 game where you have a certain number of moves and goals to make. It's very addictive. You get 1 to 3 stars per game and its very challenging to get all 3 stars. I haven`t gotten very far because I want that 3rd star. It's a really fun game.  It is worth a try. The price is definitely worth it if you don`t like you can always uninstall it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't stop reading until I hit the last page of the 3rd book. Love this trilogy!  I am now a die hard E.L. James fan.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle Monae music is fun, enlightening & very creative. I am motivated to work on my creative projects & shake my hips at the same time! I love it!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Avesome package concerning on quality, video, package itself, and the more important the beautiful Black Widow I love her is so sexy...!!!
B004WR125O|4.0|Good Range (about as good as a laptop, better than most phones), price isn't bad, must have feature if you're out of range of ethernet with your Onkyo
0446547603|5.0|This was one of the best mystery books I've ever read.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Nicholas Sparks is a great author
1451626096|3.0|I LOVE Philippa Gregory's novels. Have read every one of them. This was a fast-paced page turner. I finished it in a day. But...I was overall not impressed with the story she tells of Elizabeth of York & Henry Tudor. It seemed more imaginary than fact. I much preferred Plaidy's &#34;Uneasy Lies the Head&#34; or Margaret Campbell Barnes's &#34;The Tudor Rose.&#34;
B007BFSYMS|5.0|For years I have tried various noise machines.  This is it,  look no further.  Free on my kindle,  and I can keep adding sounds.  Thanks Amazon, thanks White Noise, love taking this every where I go.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It streams literally anything from your PC or mobile web device as long as you have a wireless network.  Only limitation is to use your device as the remote control, which can be quite an inconvenience if you don't like running back and forth between your laptop and the TV just to pause the movie.  But it can be solved with streaming from an iPhone or other mobile device to use as a remote, which I plan on getting real soon.  Aside from that, I don't feel the need to get a Roku or other player, since you can access any site and stream in a browsing tab.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's amazing! It's colorful! It's got so much more then the Facebook game, and its fun!!!! I am so glad they finally made it into an App!!
140006922X|5.0|Interesting to see a more realistic picture to what Jesus could have been. Sounds so much more reasonable than what Christianity teaches.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It was an amazing book. I had to read ot for class and i read four weeks ahead and finished it. Sooooo good.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is stupid, stupid addictive. I think next time I'll take up something a little less addictive, like smack.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Incredibly fun an  a bit difficult. It is a surprising how all of the temple run themed games are so much different from one another although there's only really a change in theme.
006202406X|5.0|It's a great book, easy and exciting to read, and a great series of three.  beautiful hard cover to add to my library
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is the best game so far I have gotten for my kindle fire hd so get this game today and you won't f2f ie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is not that I'm addicted. I can totally quit any time. I'm a just play it  when I have down time. Like, while eating meals, while driving in the car, while going to the bathroom, while lying in bed at night... all night.<br /><br />Just kidding. Mostly.<br /><br />Some of the levels take a lot longer to pass than others, but if it were all easy I would've gotten bored long before level 375.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down and I'm no longer worried about the series losing steam as it continues. This story  has Pendergast and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Corrie exploring an old crime that leads to the discovery of a present day crime, that connects back to Victorian time. In addition to the the main story, there is an entertaining original Sherlock Holmes story within the book. If you are a fan of the Pengergast books, this is a must read. And while the context of prior stories gives this one more depth, it would not be a bad first book, since the story is self-contained, with only a few, well explained, references to to the rest of the Pendergast Universe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love candy crush so much that i have it on my IPAD  and KINDLE FIRE, I AM SEVENTY THREE YEARS OLD and i can truly say it is the best game ever made.
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|I was originally just looking for something to spend my promotional credit on and had heard Lorde's song &#34;Royals&#34; on the radio several times and thought she had a good voice. Let the 5 stars speak for itself: I was not disappointed. If you like Lorde's voice, this EP would give you a great sample of her range and abilities. While I used promotional credit for this, I would be willing to pay the 3.99 out of pocket - it is truly worth it.
140006922X|5.0|Very good read.  It pulls you in and is hard to put down.  I recommend this thought provoking book to anyone who is interested in history, regardless of religious leaning.
B00G32OER4|2.0|After all the build-up I thought The Conjuring would scare the bejeebers out of me, but it was just the usual &#34;ghosts&#34; wandering around in dirty nightgowns, breaking things on the wall, and I could see the black sleeves for those hands that pop out of nowhere. Did I miss something here? The last scary movie that actually scared me was Silence of the Lambs.  I will say the musical score was pretty good.  4/5 for good, creepy music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|MY DAUGHTER TURNED ME ON TO THIS GAME AND I AM HOOKED. THIS IS THE MOST ENJOYABLE GAME I HAVE PLAYED . I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN.
1609613937|5.0|Am big fan's of Dr McDougall and always interested in his latest research findings.  This book will help supplement the knowledge we've gained from his writings so far.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|This series was a shot in the dark for me because I had not heard of it untill for some reason I read the reviews on Amazons site. It is a great adventure. Cannot wait for the release of the second season.
B0078XFYDA|2.0|As a huge fan of the Selfish Gene, I was very disappointed in this one. Dawkins offers such a simplified view of life, the universe, and everything that it trivializes the sum of human knowledge. If you have even a rudimentary understanding of science you will find the language to be insulting. On the bright side, I'm thinking about buying a copy for my 10 year-old niece. I think she would benefit from it.
B000JLK5NW|5.0|Awesome products. Works really well. Use a large pair of Pliers or Vise Grips to tighten securely and it will stay set.
B00DONF9SS|3.0|I really wanted to give this five stars, but just couldn't. I really anticipated getting Sailor Mercury after receiving Sailor Moon. The shipping was very fast and I was happy about that. However, once I got her, I noticed a few issues. First off. What you see on the box, is not what you get. The back of her hair is extremely long, making it awkward to pose her. The back of her hair really is what did this for me. On the box, she has short to no hair in the back. But once you open the figure she has a lot of her back there, and she cant look up, or properly do the poses the way it showed online and even on the box. I'm very disappointed with this. I don't know if everyone's figure is the same, but mine seems to be this way. Also, on box it shows her legs all the way together, mine cannot do that. Overall. I do like it. She is very cute, and well painted. I love all the interchangeable parts of her face, the hands and her goggles! I just really wish what you saw on the box was exactly what you got!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book!! Fell in love with the characters and the story line! Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Loved it!
1780387105|5.0|Can't say enough. I am just learning to play acoustic guitar. I love the ease in which the lessons are presented. There's not any fluff or tons of technical jargon. Just enough instruction to get you going and things are dumbed down enough that you are playing a song on the first lesson, which motivates you to keep going. I highly recommend this book for people who are trying to learn on their own.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun to play it challenge you on how to make a move. The one thing I don't like about the game is they want you to purchase the next episode of the game.
B008742O32|5.0|This is a great app for connecting to your computer. I was having issues connecting my Galaxy S3 to the computer, I could charge it, but it wouldn't recognize it as a drive so I couldn't transfer files. This solved all my problems. I can transfer files, pictures, to and from the phone with ease.<br /><br />It's also pretty nice to be able to use it to read and send text messages to someone with the desktop app.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Well...who doesn't love Monster, Inc., and here they are again.  We have ages 2-7 and all love this movie.  So cute!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved all of the Lord of the Rings movies so I was eager to start buying the Hobbit series as well. Great price and great movie!
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|my daughter loved it.. I watched it with her and it was a cute little movie.. a must have for a girls collection..
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|This movie is so great and my daughter claimed the toy (Belt) right away. She even likes to sleep with him.
B00CITOS4A|5.0|Scott Kelby does an excellent job of presenting material to enhance your photography skills, although his humor at the beginning of each chapter is a little tiring. Already purchased Part 2 and will probably get the next two editions.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Divergent, insurgent, allegiant Are like the best books ever. So many people should read them. Can't wait for the movies.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|First of all, like many other people have said, this movie was an extremely poor adaptation of the book. However, that was only a minor annoyance compared to the rest of this movie's shortcomings. The special effects looked cheap, the casting was all wrong, the main character looked about 10 years too old for the part he was playing, the &#34;Southern Bell&#34; characters were over-the-top to the point that it resembled an SNL skit....I could go on and on. On the plus side, if you have &#34;tweens&#34; or &#34;teens&#34; that want to see this film, I don't remember any of the content being objectionable for those ages.
0525953728|5.0|Great read!  Detailed, gripping, and very, very real. The true story of American heroes written by someone who was there.  I highly recommend it!
B0089OBLDO|3.0|This item does work but found it quite difficult to set up, ended up just using the basic functions, otherwise it was okay.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It's a classic - what more can one say?<br /><br />Well-written & relatively easy to read/understand considering the time of its publication & the author himself.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are great and the music is very relaxing. The graphics are nice and colorful and this is a way to help you relax after a very stressful day. I love putting the puzzles together.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|Love love love queen.  As twenty words are the minimum required for a review the easy option would be to just use love a lot of times.  Paul Rogers is not Freddy and he is not trying to be but the music works and I am happy to have this disc in my collection.  Oh yes the title track is fan-tastic
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Works great, only took 20 seconds to pair with my wife's iPhone 4s.  Clear audio both ways. Works with Siri and contacts list for voice dialing.  We'll see how long the battery lasts.  Very good first impression, good value if it lasts.  Will update review in a month.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging, so glad that it's available for the kindle. This game will keep you occupied for hours. I would recommend it.
0399157573|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Dust.  As a long time fan of Cornwell's and Dr. Kay Scarpetta, I loved the ease of the writing and the reflections back with enough tie in that it shouldn't leave those new to the series behind.  I'm trying to decide if all of the reflections were truly revealed before in earlier writings (?). But nevertheless enjoyed the entire book!  I loved the true technical tie ins, you can always tell the depth of research that goes into each book, and yet Cornwell doesn't get so technical that she leaves the reader lost in the terms.  The storyline, as always was great and I find myself eager for yet another!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|its a pretty good game id recommend you get it its very addictive sweet sweet sweet sweet cool awesome wow cool
B000063DGC|2.0|This would be an incredible album if it weren't for the terrible mastering. Randy's over-saturated distortion sounds great on studio recordings, but the engineers really over did it for the purposes of this \\"tribute.\\" I can understand that Randy should be featured prominently in the mix of an album dedicated to his memory, but his guitar levels are so high, and there is so much crowd noise and stage echo added in, that your ears will quickly grow tired of listening to it. Don't get me wrong, I love the blaring sound of an over-driven Marshall amp, but this is just annoying. Van Halen and Tony used some wicked distortion in the '80s, but it didn't sound ridiculously harsh and it didn't overpower the vocals, bass, and even drums. It's like holding a buzz saw up to your head. I've never been able to make it past track three without needing to give my now-ringing ears a break. I'm sure some of you aren't as concerned with recording quality, but even when listening to this a low volumes, the sound is rough.<br /><br />This album deserves a complex remix and a dynamic remaster fitting of its historical importance.<br /><br />Google \\"the loudness war\\"

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love playing this game. I just  started playing it yesterday and I'm already hooked. I just wish that I could earn coins and crowns faster.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book starts out slow but it is well worth the time to get to  the action.  Some of the chapter transitions are strange but, again, keep reading.  It's not until the last chapter that it all gets tied up with a bow.  Great book.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|This ap will not allow me to borrow books as a member of Amazon Prime. Not Android friendly at all.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Scott, if you stop writing, I might cry. And I haven't done that in 20 years. Keep up the awesome work.
0399255370|5.0|good for the young and older kids!  All ages will get something from this book! I highly recommend it! Buy it!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is an excellent watch at an extremely low price.  It's solid and well made, and also very accurate for an automatic watch.  I lost one minute in the first month.  The watch face is also easy to read.  The small size is not a problem for most, since the watch is quite thick, sits relatively high on the wrist, and looks like a bigger watch.
0375842209|5.0|A well written, interesting story.<br />Soon to be a major motion picture.<br />I've recommended this book and other have loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|App works even better on my kindle than on my phone. So glad it is finally available for kindle! Fast, too.
006202406X|4.0|After looking at several reviews and comments I simply must add my own comments about this novel. It's dynamic, fascinating and moving. I truly enjoyed the story including the development of the romance between Four (Tobias) and Tris. The tale develops according to the personalities of the characters. True, I was sometimes disappointed in the portrayal of Four's fears and insecurities because I found them so hard to believe after reading the first two novels in the series. However, Tris emerges as a strong, mature character who bolsters him in every way because she loves him. Told from both viewpoints, the two narratives are linked in such a way that I felt the story flowed well. In short, as my reading progressed I found it hard to put the book aside.<br /><br />Leaving the city, to travel outside and discover the truth takes courage to face the unknown. When the group, led by Tris and Tobias, find another controlled society where the city is viewed as an experiment and the people within it as scientific subjects, they are not certain where to turn. And, because of the decision by the scientists to reset the city - start over - the group cannot bear to see the memories of their friends and families erased. Yet how can a group of newcomers change the outcome? Knowing that the scientists were responsible for so much of the chaos and death in the city they are determined to try to save the city. As the book comes to it climax I found myself running with these young idealistic young people so full of hope for the future.<br /><br />Yes, I thought this was an excellent well written novel. I'm glad I read it and believe that the author did credit to her story and the characters in the outcome. Rather than give away the ending, I simply suggest that it be read with an open mind and enjoy it for its many merits.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I enjoyed this story.  Cleared up a lot of questions that I had about Apple (e.g., how the name &#34;Apple&#34; was chosen for the name of the computer, why Apple doesn't use Flash, etc.).
B000FBJHEO|4.0|I picked up Cosmopolis as part of my endeavor to get more into the writing of Don DeLillo and I came away impressed with the book and his interesting albeit sometimes herky-jerky style of writing.  This book is about a man named Eric Packer who we find one early morning in New York trying to do two things:  get a haircut and make a huge bet on the fall of the yen. The rest of the day (and the book) we find Eric driving around in the most tricked-out, secure, over the top limo (with a built in toilet) running into people who are all part of his life in some way and having brief interactions with them--most ending in some sort of sexual transaction.  He does this with his employees, security guards, and his wife-although it is unclear if it is actually his current wife or ex-wife or mysteriously both.  His car runs into odd protests and explosions around the city and a presidential motorcade. This is by far one of the oddest books I have read in some time. DeLillo is a genius writer but you have to concentrate pretty hard to really understand the message he is trying to get across. I enjoyed the book and recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book!  Enjoyed the author's style of writing.  I really enjoyed the end--it's worth reading the book to get to the end.  A great book club discussion book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm biased because I love John Grisham--and he didn't disappoint.  It's a good book club discussion read.  Very entertaining. Great story line.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Rather enjoy this game.  Needs more aura when starting. I like it a lot.  Animation is stellar great inter face.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a great book!!  I usually can read a book VERY fast.  This book, I had to marinate on.  So glad they made a movie--can hardly wait to see it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is so funny I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants it is awsome
B009O07NDY|5.0|I treated myself to this! I simply love the soundtrack.  The layers of sound is wonderful, the extras are a blast.
0385537131|5.0|Grisham's best book in awhile! I can't wait for the movie to come out!  A really good story. A must read
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August shouldn't  be judged by his face. via Is awesome. Jack will was a good friend for August. Julian was so interested in star wars.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I first hear of David Sedaris when he was reading, &#34;Santa Land Diaries&#34; on NPR.  I couldn't stop laughing as soon as I heard it; I even made myself 15min late to a meeting because I wanted to hear the end.  I quickly purchased the book and after reading the first story I was hooked on David Sedaris.  He is hands down my favorite author.  Since then I have purchased every book (and the play he co-wrote with Amy Sedaris).  I have also seen him in person.  Lately I haven't enjoyed his books quite as much (maybe he's running out of material?) but he is still far superior to most authors.  This book has remained far and away my favorite.  It's not just a comedy - it has heart.  Though the statement is trite, there is no other way to explain it.  READ IT!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I can't use the app offline like the same app I downloaded to my android phone. Maybe it's just the me, but the Kindle fire was a big waste of money
B00B0HXC4I|3.0|I have a hard time listening to the entire Opus Eponymous, though I must have listened to Infestissumam more than 666 times in the last couple months. Though I haven't quite given up listening to it, so far it sounds like a cheap Mercyful Fate-knockoff, minus the awesome King Diamond vocals -- &#34;Elizabeth&#34; being a prime example. I wish I had just kept listening to this on YouTube instead of buying it on impulse. Their second album, on the other hand, is one of the best albums I have ever had the diabolical pleasure of listening to.
B006DGOV9Q|4.0|The battery life is nearly as good as when I initially bought the phone, and seeing as until I put this new battery in I could do barely anything with the phone without it dying on me this is a vast improvement. The one thing is the battery is slightly smaller than I expected so it fits rather loosely into the slot. Other than that works great!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I think I'm really going to like this game.  Seems fun and fun fantasy idea.  Good game.  Recommend for anyone
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|If you are reading this and haven't clicked &#34;BUY&#34; yet, do so IMMEDIATELY! I am a snob and I believe this to be the most crucial and essential of all Led Zeppelin albums. They really pulled it off. They achieved their old style and sound and so much MORE! It's so much more than I ever expected. I thought they were old. They are not. I thought years of folk singing would drag down Plant's performance it did not, it has only improved the vocals. I thought Page's playing would be slowed or less impressive due to age - I found quite the opposite. This is truly an incredible album and an experience I cannot put into words. BUY BUY BUY! Amazing performance. Led Zeppelin is at their BEST! If only they would go on tour.
B00FHB7398|5.0|Well worth the couple of $ for this game ! Great graffics ,story line, hidden objects, puzzles are good. So are the hints with no penalties, sometimes it's really needed.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Works as advertised. Nothing different than the original I got with the bluetooth. Keep a couple handy. I have 3.

B008220BLG|4.0|This is a good movie it takes a different twist on zombie movies and I normally don't like this kind of movie but I just had to add it to my collection.
B002RKRUEA|5.0|Thank you Amazon.<br />It's a very good quality . I will recommend it to all my friends & relative .
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|I laughed so hard at this movie in the movie hall my stomach hurt when I left. I enjoyed it so much that I decided that I was going to pre-order a new release on dvd for the first time. The content of this movie is hilarious and I give it a thumbs up as one of the best movies I've seen this year!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Have tried several times and still can't down load this App to my Kindle Fire for my Grandson!  Should have read some of the other reviews before purchasing this App.  Now I'm out $1.00 and a very upset Grandson.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I read the first two books of the Divergent Trilogy back-to-back and loved them both. In fact, when I learned the release of Allegiant wouldn't be out for nearly 6 months after I had finished the first books, I didn't know how I'd survive the suspense for that long!! Haha! But, I'm here to tell you all that I did, indeed, survive my wait and purchased Allegiant on the first day it went on the market in the US. As always, Veronica Roth did not let me down. This final installment in the Divergent Trilogy is a great read for all ages. I will admit, though, it did start off a little slow for me at the beginning. Also at first, I wasn't sure I liked the bouncing back-and-forth between Tris telling a chapter, then Tobias (Four) telling a chapter and so on and so forth; however, by the middle of the book I was totally drawn back into the story line and completely understood by the end, why Roth chose this style with this particular literary work.<br />I definitely recommend this book, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the entire trilogy as much as I have!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of the best games out there!! It's free, high quality, and most importantly fun! I recommend this game to anyone!
0321934318|5.0|I scoured most of the other reviews and couldn't find the answer to what seems like an important question: what skill level is this book aimed at?  I've been working with Lightroom daily since the first release and I figured it would tell me stuff I already knew. Reading the reviews, I also expected it to be loaded with forced, unfunny humor. Neither turned out to be true.<br /><br />This book accomplishes the unusual feat of being helpful to beginners and experts alike. Lightroom is a powerful program, and powerful programs have lots of details and multiple ways of doing things. This book is more than a how-to guide. The rudiments are covered, but they're covered quickly, like in a sentence or two. The rest of each section tells you why and how to do things that go well beyond the basics. I wish I'd read it years ago. It would have saved me a lot of time.<br /><br />Reading this book as someone who knows Lightroom is like visiting a big city where you know the street system and freeways and suddenly you meet a local who shows you all the secret passageways and shortcuts that make getting around so much more effective and fun. I didn't go two pages without learning something useful I didn't know.<br /><br />Now, a lot of fuddy-duddy reviews here complain about Kelby's writing style and particularly his humor. He warns you up front that he indulges in a freeform passage at the beginning of each chapter that doesn't relate directly to the curriculum but is just there for comic relief. He even suggests that if you don't think he's funny you should skip these intros. They're harmless. Some are funny. They're really no more distracting than having illustrations at the beginning of the chapters. But judging from some of the reviews here you'd think the guy couldn't go two sentences without cutting up. It's just not true. Kelby's writing is conversational and direct. Many pages go by with no humor at all.  Most of the book is useful information imparted painlessly and efficiently.<br /><br />So there it is: I hope I answered the question other reviews didn't about who the book is addressed to. It's equally suited to beginners and experts--no small feat. Most software instruction guides are simplified versions of the user's manual with bigger font sizes and color illustrations.  Not this one; it teaches the basics and digs deeper simultaneously.<br /><br />I also hope I helped to debunk the rap that Kelby is obtrusively comedic.  He's not.  He's witty, clear, and describes complex things so you don't forget them the next time you sit at your computer. I can pretty much promise that you'll get more out of Lightroom, and gain a greater appreciation for it, after you read this book.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Never thought I would find myself loving a Katy Perry cd...but I am not ashamed to admit that I love it!
1742204147|3.0|Pretty dense travel book. It has historical reference material to go with the up to date travel information. It did not have updated information about Fukushima's nuclear issues, however, which is too bad since this was before the publication date. Also, if you could get this on iPad, it would be better because this book weighs a bit much for a small paperback due to its density.<br /><br />Our trip to Japan will not be until 2014, so we'll publish an update later.
B00C9G22R2|3.0|This movie is ok. I thought the main story was about IP man but somehow the plot got lost. I recommend if anyone want to see a movie about IP man, get the one with Donnie Yen. There's 1 & 2 and the martial art moves are incredible. This one starring Tony Lueng and he's not known for martial art movies.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This IS a practical useful accessory for a stroller -- easy to install -- fits plenty of items.  Would definitely recommend.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was soul searing, but I kept returning to experience more.  I have no life  pictures to help me really see what  the Book Thief survived.  I will long REMEMBER ...the village of Himmel, Germany and the amazing existence of one small group of survivors during a time of pure hell on earth.  Rudy, Papa Hans, Mama Rosa, Ilsa Hermann, Max and of course...Liesle Meminger .<br /><br />Thank you for opening my eyes.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Marje W.

B000001FQJ|5.0|evidence of their genius.  as if any were needed.  the genius is there always with tff.  when this album came out i was a kid and i thought it sounded geezer.  like a cup of ovaltine.  since my teenage years i've grown quite a bit in what i like and don't.  can't do rock music anymore (except the stones).  an affection for brazilian jazz.  dear to my british roots.  alternative we called it.  to listen to this album now after all these years.  i'm blown away.  i love every song.  it's so good.  oh my goodness.  this is jazz, and rock, and pop, and vocal, and british :)  bought this on cassette.  chrome 120 eq, rip the audio with audacity, hooking directly into back of vintage marantz deck.  results are incredible.  love these late 80's early 90's metal cassettes.  cheap too.  the production of this album is as good as it gets.  great for the audiophiles out there.  i'd say a must have if you love music and your stereo.
B008220C56|1.0|Lousy movie of a great story.  It is all gimmick and no substance.  Forget about buying it.  May the the worst movie we have ever tried to watch.
B007WA56SC|5.0|Music is great.  Auto-Rip is a nightmare.  It is anti intuitive.  The software just starts doing things.  I just want to download the CD I just bought but Auto-Rip starts checking my computer for music I have on it and I have no idea what it is doing with this information.  I just want to download the CDI just bought.  Don't count on Auto-Rip working for you.  Seems like an invasion of privacy to me.

B00BSBR9N6|3.0|I never seemed to connect with the characters.  It was similar to the book Tim in a lot of ways. (Tim was better).  I get that the main character wasn't really aiming at being that likable, but I just never really cared if he could find the right person.  And why bring in his family?  The brought nothing to the story.
0544002318|4.0|This was an enjoyable book. I disagree with some of the vegan pushing but, over all I enjoyed this book.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The book moved back and forth more than I like. It had a nice ending even though it was slow at times and a little way out for me.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Ok this is by far my favorite Sonic Games for the Iphone! But one question. Where's Shadow? He's my favorite Sonic character in the full series, happy Silver is in it but where is Shadow?
038541627X|5.0|Really great condition. It doesn't come with a sleeve, or any cover though, so the front and back covers are just plain blue. Still has the title and author on the spine

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|If you have made it to this point in the series, you have to finish the saga.  I loved this final telling and found it easy to read on the kindle.  Being on the road for work, it was easy for me to read bits and pieces, quickly returning to where I was.  Thank you for sharing your story Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for completing it.  May James Oliver Rigney, Jr. rest in peace.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wow! This is so different from his other novels. I never wanted this to end. Did you ever feel that way when reading a book before? So interesting to see how he imagined how the world would be by just changing one event, then trying to go back and &#34;fix&#34; it. Can it ever be undone? So captivating, I found myself reading into the wee hours many times.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This narrative pulled me in and amazed me as the author painted a picture of two people refusing to be constrained by their culture, yet punished severely by their refusal. The depth of character development created such realism and grace to these two people, that though the reader could be saddened by decisions they made (and indeed, they also were sometimes suffering from their own choices)it was easy to understand the intensity of the forces propelling them. The ending was totally unexpected to me, since I did not know the story before this reading, and I grieved the loss of Mamah. What a future she could have had! We are poorer for not having had her talents and influence survive. In so many ways Frank Lloyd Wright was not worthy of her.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a truly well put together game. The graphics and audio are wonderful. I'm not particularly a fan of hunting but I have enjoyed playing this game and I'm sure you will as well.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when this thing arrived in the mail.  This is my first Cold Steel product (SRK with VG 1 San Mai) and I had read reviews ranging from this is the greatest knife ever made to it's just an ok knife and the rest is all Cold Steel's marketing hype.  I have not yet put the knife through the paces, and in all probability won't test the knife to its limits, but here are my impressions out of the box.<br /><br />This knife is unbelievably sharp out of the box.  I mean scary sharp, so sharp I was happy to see the sheath in a plastic bag so I could free it.  The plastic seemed to separate prematurely in fear of this knife's blade, as if it were melting instead of being cut, it's that sharp. One reviewer described this thing as so sharp it could \\"cut a hole in time\\", which I thought was funny but now realize is not far off.  As far as shaving goes, as most of use to describe sharpness, well I've had razors that didn't shave as well. (I have bald spots all over me thanks to this knife)<br /><br />The handle feels great in hand and is designed for function and not looks, although I don't think it looks too shabby.  The knife balance feels good as well with the center of gravity being just ever so slightly above where your index finger rests.  I could see however how folks with bigger hands may want a little more girth in the handle.<br /><br />I've read similar mixed reviews on the sheath, with some saying it's the knife's only flaw.  I disagree and really like the sheath.  The knife snaps into place very firmly and takes quite a tug to get it back out. It's easily secured upside down in the sheath without the handle strap and there's no danger of the knife falling out.  I can see how someone may not push the knife fully into the sheath and this may have been the problem on the negative reviews (or defective sheath).  There are 2 Phillips screws that hold the belt loop portion to the sheath.  I like this feature since you could remove this and use the paracord holes (another feature) to lash it to MOLLE gear or anything else for that matter.  The belt loop also has a Velcro and button so you can add and remove without taking off your belt.<br /><br />I really like this knife so far and think any sane person will recognize it as an exceptional knife for the money.  I ordered a Fallkniven A1 at the same time and at first impression, prefer the SRK, an incredible feat considering the A1 is 70-75% more.  I will say that it also depends on your planned use.  The A1 looks like it's better suited for chopping, batoning, and other \\"bigger knife is better\\" activities.  The SRK on the other hand is little smaller, lighter, thinner, sharper, and looks better suited for cutting, slicing, and piercing activities.
B008COD5UI|3.0|I didn't like the movie that much it wasn't that interesting it was just about them throwing a huge party and stuff. I stopped watching it halfway through maybe that's why I didn't like the movie.

This is now my favorite movie over my long-time favorite, &#34;A Few Good Men.&#34; Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock are such A-list actors & have great chemistry in this movie! Keanu, Jack Traven, is the hottest cop on the big screen, ever! Love watching his face & acting throughout! ^_^ &#60;3
B004U8VWIM|5.0|It's a great movie it's centered around nyc ballet and I was always interested in ballet when I was young. Yea you should watch this movie it's interesting.
B002GHHHPQ|1.0|The DVD I received from here was obviously filmed by someone watching the movie on a screen. It is grainy, in cropped format and has permanently emblazoned subtitles! Very disappointing! Even though it is cheap at this price it was not worth the money!
B003QSMC18|5.0|Amazing movie even though I'm in college I still like this movie. You don't have to be a kid to watch it it's great for family movie night.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|They should have stopped after the second movie. The scenes were played out. It felt like they did not try.
B001706I5I|5.0|If I could give it more stars I would. This movie is the best ! Especially because Christmas is coming up ! I totally recommend this movie it's so funny and so sweet and you can show it to kids and they will like the movie too. It's great for a family movie night.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Funny movie but I would not have watched it on my own. If you are looking for a laugh and are running out of your movie selection give it a shot
B0093QE37S|4.0|Love old movies! This was very entertaining and of course, with such great actors! Grant, Stewart and Hepburn were really amazing.
0545586178|4.0|Good book worth a read if you have some free time. It was cheaper than I could find in the stores ie Barns and Nobles and SAMs Club.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|I've been a PJ fan since the early 90's (who hasn't right?) and, while I love all of their stuff, I can't quite stop holding out hope that they'll release another &#34;Ten&#34;.  Still, this is a solid album.  My favorites are &#34;Sirens&#34; and &#34;Yellow Moon&#34;.
B009GX69RK|4.0|Great show, it is like a combination of the shows like Big Bang Theory and Friends. Just with out the science humor and Sheldon.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've always loved the blog, and the book seems like one long blog post, all over the place but coming together perfectly.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|It's a great movie and one you should see if you haven't. I can't really say much about the movie that hasn't been said.<br /><br />This BD/DVD package is good but mine came with a rippled plastic on the case. The art isn't messed up and neither is the cardboard sleeve. I'll just have to find a replacement case which isn't too hard.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This app is great!! It's a better (movie related) temple run. I enjoy this app because of its high quality. Watch out for the monkeys and ever other creatures lurking for trouble.
B00936A0RU|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I thought they did a great job with the costumes/hair. If you love stories about running moonshine or period dramas, then check this one out.
020530902X|5.0|if you are in graduate school, this book is a must! It helped me dramatically and even my adviser admitted to improvements in my writing
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm so upset the book is over, can't wait until the next segment.. You will enjoy this book, I assure you.. RIP RUE!!!!!!!
0062107313|3.0|I've enjoyed Amy Tan novels in the past, but in this one I get the distinct impression that she is being paid by the word. Way too much exposition. The subject matter is engaging enough, but Tan cannot make the deeply flawed characters elicit any empathy. All of these women made extremely impulsive decisions which turned out badly. Two thirds of the way through I was exhausted and didn't really care what happened to any of them. Disappointing.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|The storyline was not that interesting and/or realistic IMHO. The women were gorgeous to look at otherwise it was not<br />worth a higher rating.
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller. He masterfully weaves the lives of his characters together in a way that leaves the reader wanting to find out more. His narrative is particularly intriguing when you consider the heroic and admirable women and the villainous men. I can't spend too long on this review as I am anxious to find out what happens in book 3 to my heroes both male and female. GOODSHOW  Sir Jeffrey!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga it is so easy to play .I love the way u have to swipe your finger
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|I rarely write reviews for apps, but this game is so much fun! I really like how different it is. There is nothing else quite like it! Really cute characters and great challenges. The premise is simple enough, but each task can be quite challenging. I like that I can choose to either play for fun or to complete each level' s tasks. This game is great no matter what age! Simply cannot stop playing it!
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I heard &#34;Holes&#34; on ITunes Radio, and I was completely attached to this band. I bought this CD for my father, as he is just as in love as I am. Every single song is good. This is what I have been taught to call a &#34;No Skip CD&#34; Buy it, you will be in love too.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this game a lot so far. However, I lost 30 crowns somehow without unlocking or purchasing anything so I am a bit peeved. They were free crowns, but still. Really now?
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Well polished, very well done, a great example of how great movies make great games. I love it so much.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The second time around. I reread the trilogy in preparation to see the second movie. I still can't believe that these books were written for teens.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|You spend a lot of time waiting. You can't just start up an action and walk away, because the wait time could be only a few minutes. Just long enough that you don't want to go to another game, and you get stuck waiting. I only downloaded this game for the free coins, and it is a free game. I do find it entertaining. I just don't like the amount of time spent waiting it out. It's worth a try for anyone who has never played before. Easy enough to get the hang of it. You build and create many different things to sell. Send heroes on little exploratory journeys. Work to create a kingdom.
1250038820|5.0|One of the best photo books I've had the pleasure of seeing.  It captures the human spirit, and differences and the sameness that make us all unique.  People are, indeed, beautiful.  I don't see how anyone wouldn't love this book.  I just keep going back to it, and see new things each time.  LOVE IT!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pro: Simple and works well. Con: The only free streaming video app right now is from Youtube. I hope this limitation is overcome soon.
0307454568|5.0|This is the last book of The Milennium Trilogy, and it's just as good as the first two (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; The Girl Who Played With Fire).  In fact, it's a must read if you want to find out what happened to all the characters along the way.  This book ties it all up, and has its own amazing plot line.  For some (including me), it's a bit disconcerting to keep running into the names of towns and streets and stores in Sweden, but I finally got used to it by just mildly skipping over them, only recognizing them enough so that I knew it was a town, a street, or a store.  It's the story that counts, and Stieg Larsson is a great story teller.  I loved the book, and the entire series.  If you read these books, don't forget to watch the movies afterward.  They're available at Amazon, too.  I recommend the Swedish version with English subtitles.  Five minutes into the first movie, and you'll be used to hearing it in Swedish and reading what's being said.  They're like books with moving pictures.
1423140605|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. Rick Riordan is one of my new favorite authors. I strted reading all of his series to be sure that they were appropriate for my children, ages 7-13, and found myself caught up in the worlds of demi-Gods, monster, friends, and foes.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book, really we'll written,action-packed, and with tons of humor!  Leaves of on a cliff hanger, continued in &#34;The Mark of Athena&#34;.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Loved being able to  catch up in advance of the January 4th premier!! The special features were really nice, really behind the scenes and history of the Abbey.
B009NNMAZI|5.0|While Fox and Tatum are the headliners, I thought Joey King was the real star. She plays Tatum's daughter.  Anyway,  the movie plays out kind of like Die Hard, but I actually think it has more heart kind of in the lines of Independence Day or Pearl Harbor. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Well worth the $10 i paid, Russell Crowe is a beast in this movie. The case is pretty sweet too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Too freaking addicting! I do love this game, I am thrilled I can now finally play it on my Kindle Fire HD. I was about to give up hope. Enjoy!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|999(and Virtues Last Reward) were nearly impossible to put down once started. Great story lines for each character and unraveling mysteries through the room escape puzzles had me many times nodding off at all hours of the morning just because I wanted to know what happened next.
0545586178|4.0|4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />I’m probably the last person that has read Catching Fire, but like last year the movie is a couple of days away (2!) so I’d thought I’d try and finish it before then.  I’ve seen plenty of trailers of Catching Fire over the months, and thought surely the book is pretty much spoiled for me. I was wrong. The book still had plenty of twists and turns and even what I saw in the trailer still had a strong impact on me while reading it.<br /><br />Catching Fire takes place 9-12 months after the first book, Katniss and Peeta are living with their families and Haymitch in the Victor’s Village preparing for their Victory Tour through all 12 districts/Capitol. Things seem to be quiet and normal till President Snow personally visits Katniss and tells her that her stunt in the games is possibility creating unrest within the district…a rebellion against the Capitol. Katniss does everything possible to stay under Snow’s radar but it seems he is definitely out to get her no matter what, especially when he announce that the 75th Quell Games will be picked from the victor’s pool!<br /><br />I honestly didn’t think Collins could top the first book, but she manages to do so; and she does it well. The stakes were high for Katniss alone in the first book, but now everything just escalates because it involves not only her but her friend, her family, and all the districts. I was shocked by the game’s turn of events toward the end…I definitely didn’t see it coming. In my opinion Catching Fire was even better than the first book; everything is more intense and had me at the edge of my seat the entire way through till the end.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed Catching Fire, while Collins’ writing isn’t what I’d say as great; she still created a fast-paced, engaging story. I can’t believe I waited this long to read the books, and can now see why the fandom for this series is so big. If you haven’t read this series yet, or any dystopian book for that matter…I highly recommend starting with The Hunger Games/this series! (Although, again I’m sure everyone on earth has already read this series LOL).ecommend starting with The Hunger Games/this series! (Although, again I’m sure everyone on earth has already read this series LOL).
0375842209|5.0|Markus Zusak has written a classic about what it was like for ordinary Germans who lived under the rise of Naziism starting in 1939 and who hated it. Zusak traces the innocence, bravery and awakening of pre-teen girl, Liesel, who loses her family and is thrust into a foster family. As Nazis burn books, Liesel, sparked by the allure and importance of words, sets out to steal books. The author weaves Liesel's quest to absorb words with the realization of the power of Hitler's words as he mesmerizes Germany. The narrator is Death, the all-too-active participant in the war. A reader wonders, at first, if the book will be too depressing. Stay the course. You will be moved, uplifted and will gain great understanding.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My gosh! This is worth the price. You can play without WiFi ( unless co-op) and have so many towers. Get it now people. Best game of all......
B0063IH60K|4.0|When nothing is on, This is great to play. But it is very addictive. Thanks for making this game. Yeah
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Since I started playing fps this one has get to one of my top 3 just behind battlefields 2 and 2142. Great job guys keep up the good work. And thanks for the games.
0316227706|5.0|How can you not enjoy this book! I love how some of the pictures are the first time the dogs were ever in water. I am opening up my own doggie day care, I got this for just reading material for customers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game and challenging. Sometimes  t is very confusing and takes a while but it's an awesome game to plat.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I found myself picking this thrill ride up and reading it as much as possible. I felt myself want to revisit the overlook and start this whole journey again.<br />Even though this story visits Danny as he is making his way in the world,  the story stands on its own two feet whether or not you read the shinning.<br />Stephen King has a way of making me cheer out in support for his cast of characters on minute, then peek between my fingers till it's over the next.<br />Long live the king!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|As much as I love all the literary offerings of Miss Austen 's pen, this last novel is my favorite.<br />While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the acknowledged favorite, and indeed is my second favorite of the Austen tomes, \\"Persuasion\\" has better character development, especially as concerns the internal struggles of the protagonists. There is a great deal of truth, but also a great deal of fun in its pages. I feel this novel is sometimes overlooked, but it's clergymen are better people than in some of Miss Austen 's earlier novels.  My only caveat is that Jane Austen did not live to write another after this.  That is regrettable, but is an evil that must be accepted.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This light does what it is advertised to do. We like it very much. We would purchase it again and will recommend it to our friends.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This is one of those books one reads over and over for pleasure.  It is a perfect picture of life in England two centuries ago.  The heroine, Emma, is happy, has wealth and friends, and has wit enough to recognize her good fortune.  She does not need to be rescued from a possible unhappy future as do many of Jane Austen 's heroines.  There are other characters who fall into that category as well as the clergyman who is anything but Christlike in his example and is often ridiculous.  Austen is a shrewd observer of human nature and is skilled in extracting humor from their foibles.  It is the best sort of escape to dwell in her world, if only for the length of a good read.
B009K916ZK|5.0|This little gadget was a simple solution to getting me through a presentation at work!  The alternative was just WAY too much trouble!
