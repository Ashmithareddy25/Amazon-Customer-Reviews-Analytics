B008K9SG9K|5.0|One day, on iTunes, I saw this little album called Night Visions by a band that I'd never heard of. I started listening to some of the songs- and immediately bought almost all of them. Here is my in-depth review.<br /><br />Radioactive: 10/10: My favorite song on the album. My favorite song of last year. Heck, even my favorite song ever. I will admit, I'm one of those people that is a fan of dubstep, and I really like the influences in this song, but I thought the best part was Dan Reynold's singing.<br /><br />Tiptoe: 9.0: Very good song. It's almost a dancey-kind of tune, with more electronics than any of the other songs. A nice contrast to Radioactive.<br /><br />It's Time: 7.5: It's Time is a good song. It just happens to be very, very overplayed, and quite frankly, inferior to most of the other tracks here, whereas Radioactive is almost never played on the radio and it's the best song on the album. What's up with that?<br /><br />Demons: 9.5: I love this song. It might be my second favorite on the album. Really cinematic and soundtrack-ready (as is Radioactive.)<br /><br />On Top of the World: 8.0: It's pretty god, insanely catchy, and very happy. But I just don't think it can quite reach the level as some of the others.<br /><br />Amsterdam: 9.0: Although I have no idea what it's about, Amsterdam is a very solid rock song. A little confusing musically, but still really good.<br /><br />Hear Me: 9.0: Okay, this time it's my fault for overplaying. I am so sick of this song because I would listen to it nonstop. The most traditional tune here.<br /><br />Every Night: 7.5: I don't know, but I just thought this song was really boring. Too slow or something.<br /><br />Bleeding Out: 9.5: I think of this as Demons' dark twin. Similar chords, but darker mood and lyrics.<br /><br />Underdog: 6.0: I don't like this song. It makes no sense and is not pleasurable to listen to. Very grating and doesn't fit album mood.<br /><br />Nothing Left to Say: 9.0: The darkest song onthe album, like emo Every Night. I love it. But much too long.<br /><br />Rocks: 9.5: Weird and disorganized, but a spectacular ending to the (normal version of) Night Visions.<br />THE NEXT TWO SONGS ARE ONLY ON ITUNES!<br /><br />Working Man: 8.0: I used to hate this song until I found myself humming it. It's still kind of annoying, but boy, is it an earworm.<br /><br />Fallen: 9.0: Majestic and upbeat. A fitting end to a wonderful musical journey.<br /><br />This is the best album I have ever listened too. It's not perfect, but it is darn close.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book. My mom and I read the book while she was dying, and she raved about how much of the book was always what she believed. That there is so much more out there, that this earthly existence is just the beginning. I would highly recommend this book. it is entertaining as well as enlightening. It helped me especially, feel peace. I would say that it may even help a child, if they were struggling with grief.

B000O599WG|5.0|Definately in my top 3 from John Wayne.  The main character is played, obviously, by John Wayne who stars as the Sherrif in the small town (John T. Chance).  \\"Dude\\" (Dean Martin) is his deputy who's self-confidence is decreasing because he is recovering from alcoholism.  \\"Stumpy\\" (Walter Brennan) is another deputy who's crippled leg prevents him from moving around, and is stuck with the job of guarding the jail.  Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) is leading a wagon train of supplies through the town.  \\"Colorado\\" Ryan (Ricky Nelson) is Wheeler's guard on the train and after Wheeler is shot the wagon train must stay in the town forcing Colorado to stay.  He decides to help Chance and his deputies deal with the troublemaker they have in jail, Joe Burdette (Claude Akins), and his brother, Nathan (John Russell), who constantly tries to bust him out.  Angie Dickinson plays the character of a former gambling/saloon girl who tries to convince Chance that she has changed.  Overall, one of the greatest westerns ever made in the prime of John Wayne's movie career.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I enjoy Dan Brown's novels because they interlace history, religion, and story together. I was quite entertained and couldn't put the book down.<br />  The Lost Symbol is very similar to his previous work in that it provides the same plot, structure, and theme, only this time it takes place in Washington, D.C. and involves the Freemasons instead of the Knights Templar.<br />  Just like the other books, Langdon is called to Washington at a friend's request, only to find him missing, and spends the rest of the book chasing clues throughout the city and trying to outwit a new villain who is seemingly as smart as he is.<br />  Yes, this book did seem like \\"National Treasure\\"...BUT I'm glad I read it and looking forward to his next book. So far \\"Angels and Demons\\" soars head and shoulders above all his books.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|So begins Vida Winter's tale of her life story to Margaret Lea a bookshop assistant. Vida is a well-known but elusive writer who has told several dozen false tales of her life--will she tell the truth to Margaret?<br />Diane Setterfield in her debut novel spins a gothic tale of mystery, intrigue, insanity, and murder  in plot with unusual characters and many plot twists.  There are twins, and ghosts; love and incest all told in a manor house on the British moors. This enjoyable tale will keep you turning the pages and guessing about the next turn of events.  Our book club enjoyed this book very much!

B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I pretty much like three shows: Freaks and Geeks, Twin Peaks, and Battlestar Galactica. I love this one too and it doesn't make me as sad about humanity as BSG, it's has more fun and doesn't take itself too seriously allowing it to be great popcorn television without hammering at the archetypal woe notes all the time. I love watching it with my friend. We just make incredulous faces at each other about the plot twists the whole time, laugh at Felix, and remark on the acting which is pretty great. We tend to see plot twists from a mile away--we're literature professors.

B005LAIH3G|3.0|ADDED 05/28/2013<br />Re-reading my review today I realized that some clarification might be in order.  If I had not read the books, I would not be so concerned.  As a lifelong scifi fan, I enjoyed the movie.  My review was more an alert to fans of the books to temper their expectations and enjoy the movie.  My big disappointment is that when I read the books I envisioned what an amazing series of movies these books would make.  Then to have the movie mash several together from both early and late in the series left me dumbfounded.  These books were written in the early 1900s; the vision and creativity they represent are mind-boggling.  Even though the individual books are relatively short, with a couple of pretty bizarre exceptions, each is rich enough in story to be am amazing movie unto itself.  By doing some strange compression, the producers may have messed up a great franchise opportunity.  If you are a scifi fan, your really should read the John Carter series.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I am frankly shocked that such good reviews have been posted here when the reviews of this movie when it came out were bad, and it gets low ratings most places.  Having read all of the books of the Barsoom series just a couple of years before the movie came out I was really excited.  Done right, the book series could have been several amazing action-packed movies, but this was a mishmash of parts of several books.  I can usually put aside significant departures from the book and just enjoy the movie, but this one was hard to take.  The biggest disappointment is that where there could have been three or perhaps more really good movies out of this book series, I don't see how there will be another, even if IMDB does suggest there is.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the book, but was dissappointed in the ending,  Perhaps some would argue it ended the only way it could by leaving the reader to come of with their own thoughts on how this disfunctional collection of characters will continue on.

B006BAEQB2|2.0|While this is an interesting piece of speculative history, the characters are without exception two-dimensional and not all that likeable as a result.

It seems like everyone's been putting in the 1066MHz of the same ram, as that product has a ton of reviews from Synology users. However, the pre-installed RAM that comes with your Synology NAS device has 1333MHz frequency. Therefore, I wanted to try this RAM.<br /><br />And here's the great news... this works fine in my DS2413+. No problems whatsoever. Shows up as 4GB of total ram (DS2413+ comes with 2GB of RAM installed.) No boot problems.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|... is just one of the many quotable quotes in this film that will stick with you. This one is one of my personal favorites and just about as perfect as modern (post 1970) movie making gets. The messages and comparisons of the film are rather obvious, but the individual scenes, the characters, and the acting are superlative.<br /><br />Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a complex individual - he's a physician - a healer of men - who is scared to death of all mankind. In fact he seems to be scared of all living things including a friendly neighborhood dog. He's gotten away with pure research positions up to the present, but now, in 1969 and in need of a job, he takes a job as a physician in a chronic care hospital. Now here's the complexity - You'd think a man who is afraid of other people would just sit back and perform his rounds and be grateful to be around patients who are as physically catatonic as he is emotionally catatonic. However, his humanity and intellectual curiosity are stronger than his fear and desire to hide as he begins to notice \\"patterns\\" in both the behavior and in the records of some of his patients that makes him believe that they may still be \\"alive inside\\". This leads to research that pinpoints one illness that all of the patients had in common - encephalitis lethargica that spread worldwide from 1917 to 1928. After the illness subsided, sometimes years later, would the catatonia gradually set in.<br /><br />Dr. Sayer manages - with great difficulty - to get funding to try a new drug on these particular patients, and they awaken, some after 40 years, many in their 60's physically, but in their 20's emotionally.<br /><br />The focus of the movie, though, is on the friendship that forms between Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro), a 50 year old victim of the disease, and Dr.Sayer. Leonard's mother (Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe) is one of the few people visiting on a regular basis after all of these years - Leonard has been here for 30 years, ill since age 11, catatonic since age 20. So the focus is on Leonard's love of life once awakened versus Dr. Sayer's fear of it - this is the obvious part of the film. However that doesn't take anything away from De Niro doing a great job of playing someone who isn't a tough guy for a change and from Robin Williams from playing one of his most dramatic roles, both characters extremely vulnerable in their own way. Julie Kavner is pitch perfect as Dr. Sayer's loyal ,hard working, and assertive nurse and assistant. Ruth Nelson gives a performance of a lifetime, just two years before her death, as a mother who has dedicated her life to a son she remembers as and has cared for as a child for almost 40 years but is a bit perplexed when he awakens as a man and his fancy turns towards love. For once she has a rival for her son's attention, which is not unusual. What is unusual is that she has to deal with this 30 years later than most mothers.<br /><br />There are heartbreaking scenes, there are funny scenes, and one scene in particular that brings to light how people sometimes will dismiss something as possible because it just seems too horrible. My favorite scene in this latter category: Dr. Sayer, when doing his research on the catatonic patients, visits the eminent physician Dr. Peter Ingham (Max Von Sydow). Ingham was dealing with the catatonia when it first developed in the 20's and 30's. When Dr. Sayer asks Dr. Ingham how he knows that the virus has not spared the patients higher faculties he responds: \\"Because the alternative is unspeakable.\\" Classic.11, catatonic since age 20.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|It is rare to find a romance so well written. This has well sketched characters, a sharp dialogue, some great scene setting and contrary to some negative comments , plenti of chemistry. It is hard to know whyat least one of the negative comments, and  always read them, slates it as lacking in Chemistry. Perhaps they are offended by the use of masturbation to draw the  characters feelings? But surely this makes them human? Brings them alive? I almost listened and am glad I did not in the end. I will definitely try aother although my romance fiction is generally regency only and this is Victorian and has more serious themes. None the less a happy departure for me.

B00BZODDYU|3.0|This movie had all the ingredients of a good scary ghost  movie.  Characters that you grow to like as they evolve and are portrayed with good acting.  A wonderfully original and compelling plot that wasn't well worn yet still had the familiar ghost-story hallmarks.  Most importantly subtle escalation in the scares that mixed both psychological and jump-out-at-you-thrills.  I was not only rooting for our family but the ghost as well, in a looking forward to her redemption sort of way.  Really for most of the film I was expecting to write a four or five star review.  Unfortunately I found the ending to be not only rushed but altogether unsatisfying to the extend that I keenly felt the disappointment with the dashing of my high hopes.  Before going into any spoilers I'd say with the originality of the story and wonderful scare pacing I'd recommend giving Mama a watch.<br /><br />That said, It seemed the plot was setting up for more.  With the character arc of the the new parents, the custody battle sub-plot with the other aunt, the growth of the oldest girl, what was starting with the youngest, and even what they had setup with the ghost's tail...I had just expected more.  Then they just blew it in the last few minutes for, what I'm sure was, just cheap emotional tear-reaction.  The doctor was almost useless, the other aunt/custody device didn't really go anywhere, and the ghost repeating her mortal mistakes and taking the littlest girl with her just wasn't necessary and left a sour taste in my mouth after an entire movie worth of savory enjoyment.

Galaga is one of my all time faves, and this modern twist is really cool to look at and fun to play. Plays smooth and crisp. Just drag your finger around the screen to move your ship and blast the bits outta everything in sight. Fun. Happy! %^D

B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series is great- really enjoy it.  The cast is amazing and their stories keep me engaged.  Very much looking forward to Season 3.
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|Soderbergh turns in a solid psychological drama, both figuratively and literally. The setup: a psychiatrist named Banks, played by Jude Law, treats a woman, Emily, (played by Rooney Mara) for depression after she attempts suicide by crashing her car. She has other problems, too, including her husband's recent release from prison for insider trading. Of course, anti-depressants are prescribed and Emily tries a few different ones before settling on a new one that does the trick. Or does it? In a matter of months, her husband is killed and she's to blame, although she blames her actions on a sleepwalking side effect of the anti-depressant. Now things really crank up with the re-appearance of Emily's former psychiatrist (Katherine Zeta-Jones) who has some skeletons in her closet, too. Simultaneously, Banks' professional life disintegrates as he's blamed for mis-treating his patient and a number of other dubious professional acts. And just when you think it's over, it's not over in the best possible way. It wraps up almost too perfectly, but in a very satisfying way. Great performance by Jude Law; Zeta-jones could have done a little less misty-voice impressions, but still very good. What I liked most about this movie was the initial look at psychiatry as pill-pushing then a double back on those assertions, showing how people abuse the best and worst of the business. This movie has some moments that make you stop and think, which is a pleasure. Enjoy it more than once.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I wish I had read this book forty years ago when I was deciding my course in life.  It helped me understand several of the walls that I have repeated come up against.  It will be very useful to me now as I plan my retirement years.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a good followup to the first book. Action packed. Can't wait to read the third book. Loved it
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A lot of fun, just wish it lasted longer. Puzzles could be more difficult, but if you are looking for a fun and intriguing game,, this is it
193700788X|1.0|I am going to try to keep this short because there are hundreds of reviews that say what I want to say even better than I could say it, but I just had to enter my 1 star review, to show my disappointment.<br /><br />First off (Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />Sam? Seriously? Sookie and Sam never had any chemistry. I can understand that CH didn't want her to end up with a vampire (even though I kept my fingers cross for Eric) but Sam was not the answer, even there sex scene in the book was awkward IMO. I knew it was coming after the foreshadowing in the last book, but I just kept telling myself no that's too safe (and boring) for Sookie, that wouldn't work.<br /><br />And Eric, he would never put up with what they did to him this book.  He's a fighter, the book should have consisted of Sookie helping him scheme his way out of this marriage or whatever it is. Instead CH makes up some weird story trying to bring together all these people from Sookie's past that no one cares about anymore, it was just ridiculous.<br /><br />For all those reviewers who suggested CH didn't even write the story, I somewhat agree, but I think maybe instead she just didn't want to write it. There is something seriously off about this book. I mean it pretty much ruins the entire series of books.
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi, but this show is well done.  Can't wait for the next season to start in June!
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is not recommended for anyone who desires, at the very least, an interesting read with a somewhat clever plot. Will not bother reading anything else by this author.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Homeland Season 1 is well-written, intense, compelling, and timely. BUT, where is Season 2? When will it be available? Ever?
B009NY43NY|4.0|There were times when I thought I wouldn't be able to finish these books...like all series they have their ups and downs. This book was done every well and ended in a great way.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|What an odd selection of songs for this. The Elfman theme is certainly what I picked this for but the others are extremely well done versions of great songs. But it does not work for me as study music. Too interesting for that.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Even though you have to unlock the  other games, this app definitely serves it's purpose. Great when you need to kill time.
B009R659L8|1.0|I thought this book was horrible. None of the characters were particularly likable. There were so many characters and we got to find out exactly what they were wearing, what they were eating, every thought in their head.....it was boring. It was not interesting or suspenseful at all.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Using this book in my college English class,  great for discussions, journals, success strategies.  Sent it to my daughter-in-law  the principles are life changing
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Great at guessing, but when I do manage to stump him there is no way to press send to give him the name of the character and you have to close out! This needs to be fixed ASAP.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I love the dash series of games but playfirst has just lost me as a customer. I got the game as faotd and all levels were available. I installed the update and now only have half of the restaurants blocked.<br /><br />You want to charge for the game, give me adds at every level AND make me pay 4 bucks to play the full game? Ridiculous. I'm assuming they had the full game open when it was faotd in order to get positive reviews and then locked it back up so we would pay for the extra levels.<br /><br />If they want to have a pay option, it would have made sense to give it as an option if you don't want to try to get expert on every level or something. There should be a way to access the additional levels for free.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs so you can show developers that this sort of bait and switch isn't acceptable.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a helpful item to have on my kindle. Not used daily but when I need the math, it's there.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is fun, challenging and well thought out.  You will love it!  It's a game for all ages.  I enjoy playing and meeting the daily missions.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Really liked this movie.  This picture for McConaughey was the last one before he took time off to get married, have a few kids and really rethink the parts he wants to play.  I like him as an actor and am looking forward to more of his work.
B0091WMSNU|5.0|I love this movie.  Has an all star cast and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The ending is a real mind blow as well. Great story and well done movie.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Great characters, conflict, and song. The story line is interesting. For those that love broadway, this is a for you!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The story carries meaning on mutliple levels from learning how to let go of the ones we love, to facing our fears and deciphering the realities in our lives versus the smoke screens. In addition it is a visually stunning film with bright colors and contrasts.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|Forgot how much I loved this movie. These were Great performances. Don't hesitate to see again. An oldie but a goody.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool. It is really interactive and the visuals are surreal. I like the stable hand's. advice and there is something that is always to he done.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|One of those stupid games that is really addicting. I tend to play this game when I am bored. Might be a stupid game but I like it.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This is it. This is the best 3d movie I have seen yet. Better than Life of Pi and Avatar (by far). It uses every aspect of 3d, which so many movies shy away from, and they do it properly.<br />If you want to see what all 3d is capable of, this is the movie for it.
B00B2166BS|4.0|The Pogo cable considerably improves recharging time of my Google Nexus 10 tablet.  The only problem is that the magnetic connection to the tablet sometimes seems a bit weak.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I purchased this movie and we loved it.  I bought it from Amazon so that I could show it to the residents at a retirement community where I work,  they loved it.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has done it again.  A great summer book that begs you to sit down on the porch with a glass of iced tea and enjoy guessing whatvis coming next.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|I buy very few albums... mostly just individual songs.  This album is awesome and FGL is one of my favorite groups right now.  I also dig the live tracks from Joe's Bar in Chicago.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Turn on the closed captioning or else you will miss half of what's being said. But even then it's hard to figure out who is who in the different time periods. it was semi entertaining, but I wouldn't recommend it. The over all moral of the story was a bit cliche to base the entire movie off of.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  I purchased it from Amazon and showed it to the residents at a retirement community where I work.  They loved it.
0062059963|5.0|The Elite is the sequel to The Selection by Kiera Cass which was one of my most anticipated releases of this year. The Selection has been described by many as The Hunger Games meets The Bachelor. I have been a fan of Kiera Cass even before she published books from youtube. I really enjoyed The Selection it was a great world and very exciting. It was definitely nice to see a mix of a very serious topic but with a very fluffy twist. One thing that I disliked about The Selection was that it had an abrupt ending. As soon as the story picked up the pace it ended. At times I felt like these two books could have been one large book.<br /><br />The Elite left me with some mixed feelings. I think it was a great continuation and displayed a large amount of character development but at the same time I didn't like said developments. The Elite had a ton more action than the first book from the rebels, torture, and girl fighting. Overall it had a more intense and anxious mood to it.<br /><br />I am definitely TEAM MAXON but both Maxon and America bothered me this book. Seriously the worst thing Maxon could ever do was kiss Celeste and he did. So now as a reader I don't trust him. Even though he explained himself and was warranted because America was being a moody bitch. I still ship them but they can be downright annoying at times. Then the whole Marlee thing happened and America was more upset by it than Marlee. She blamed it on Maxon when he had nothing to do with it. Aspen and Kris really surprised me because they were two characters that I tried too hard to not like but I really couldn't help it.<br /><br />I definitely felt that The Elite explained and showed more of the caste system. In the reports we realize how greedy and unfair the king truly is. Maxon hasn't even had total control in The Selection. I think Maxon will make a great king as of how he changed in this installment.<br /><br />I feel as though nothing much happened throughout this book yet so much did. It endsoff pretty much the same way as The Selection of America having to make a choice. This time it had less to do with Aspen but more her choice to actively try to win The Selection. America may annoy me as a character but she really does want to bring about change. I love how strong she is.<br /><br />This series is a trilogy and the next book is titled The One (cover art not revealed as of now). This title definitely means Maxon is going to pick someone. (Fingers crossed it is America) or even America will have to choose. I hope that The One will finally answer my questions about the rebels and the war. I still feel slightly unconfused about the back story of the royal family. I can't wait for The One! Also I was so bummed to find out that The Selection pilot wasn't picked up by The CW!<br /><br />~ Review from ARC that was WON!
0525425772|5.0|My husband and son are huge fans of Theodore Boone. Grisham has done a great job of transitioning to a voice that the younger audience can connect to. The situations are real and the characters deal with them honestly. The plot is interesting and does not resolve quickly or easily. They have learned a lot about the legal world and how it impacts the everyday life.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|This was a great Kung Fu movie. Keeping in the tradition of the old classics. Well directed. I enjoyed watching.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Interesting game.  I will be waiting anxiously for the next one.  What's with the stonehenge thing at the end? An odd ending but a good puzzle game.
B00CKWQN9S|3.0|Much like the film itself, The Great Gatsby soundtrack (formerly titled [[ASIN:B00C2VGAW2 Music From Baz Luhrmann's Film: The Great Gatsby]]) is drawing both positive and negative reviews, depending on who you ask.  Ultimately, from personal perspective, the compilation is a mixed bag with some triumphs and some blunders/lesser cuts.  To add additional perspective, many of the `elite', winning cuts aren't necessarily `valedictory' in themselves; they are merely the `best' among a mixed effort.<br /><br />\\"100$ Bill\\" starts things off well, borrowing dialogue from the film itself.  The production work is rather simple, but gets the job done.  Jay-Z rhymes solidly, but few of the signature `Hov' lines standout compared to his studio album material.  Andr&eacute; 3000 and Beyonc&eacute;'s take on Amy Winehouse's \\"Back to Black\\" is a great remake, though it never hopes to compare to the soulful, troubled original by the late soulstress. That said, the reserved, electronic interpretation still conveys the gloom of the cut, which is interesting.  Things get clumsy with will.i.am's gimmicky \\"Bang Bang\\", which manages to sample stride piano classic \\"Charleston\\" and Sonny Bono's \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\".  Reprised from will.i.am's [[ASIN:B00BCV3HGU #Willpower]], the cut makes more contextual sense on a soundtrack, but still ends up being too manic and, well dumb.  Will.i.am loves to `go stupid' though.<br /><br />Fergie, Q-Tip, and Goonrock combine for another mixed-emotions cut in \\"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)\\".  On the one hand, the energy is superb and even the production.  On the other hand, it is only a notch less `stupid' than \\"Bang Bang\\".  Lana Del Rey atones by being true to herself on \\"Young and Beautiful\\", the touted representative single.  It is solid, but with reservation; like some of Del Rey's own music, it is a bit indulgent and boring.  Not bad though, if somewhat safe.  \\"Love Is the Drug\\" follows, performed by Bryan Ferry and the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.  While it avoids the gimmickry of the will.i.am and Fergie, et al cuts, it also underwhelms, particularly from the production end - never quite gels to the ears.<br /><br />Florence + The Machine seems the apparent savior of the effort, but \\"Over The Love\\" pales when place up against \\"Shake It Out\\" or \\"Only If For The Night\\" from her latest studio album. Pieces are in place, but the finesse falls short. \\"Where The Wind Blows\\" featuring Coco O. Isn't too shabby, sampling Sophie Tucker and adding some modern flare with the drum programming.  Emeli Sand&eacute; channels her `inner-Beyonc&eacute;' on a cover of \\"Crazy in Love\\" with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.  She doesn't achieve the same swagger (few could), but it's solid.<br /><br />Alternative rock takes over the soundtrack following Sand&eacute;'s cut.  \\"Together\\" gives The xx a solid moment that's mysterious and conveys an interesting vibe.  \\"Hearts A Mess\\" is a nice contribution from Gotye's 2006 effort [[ASIN:B001MFSVXU Like Drawing Blood]], which received proper release just recently.  \\"Love is Blindness\\" finds Jack White shocking with a gritty take on U2's \\"Love Is Blindness\\".  Nero is the first hiccup in the momentum as \\"Into The Past\\" has plenty of attributes, but the track ends up a bit of a bore.  Sia salvages the momentum with an excellent closer in \\"Kill and Run\\".  The biggest rub against the Sia cut? The mixed reviews of the effort couldn't be saved by one cut alone serving as the final cut.<br /><br />All said and done, [[ASIN:B00C2VGAW2 Music From Baz Luhrmann's Film: The Great Gatsby]] doesn't quite transcend being merely as soundtrack.  It has its moments, but there are still some flaws that hold the effort back from being stronger and more universally acclaimed. It's good, but not exceptional per say.  `Mixed' is the word - 3 stars.Orchestra.

B0060CV7YK|5.0|We raised our 6 children on these types of movies and Bedknobs was a favorite. The characters are endearing and the songs are remembered for years. Now we love having this online to enjoy with our 14 grandchildren as the family tradition continues to the next generation.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This game does not install properly. I get an error message on every attempt to install on multiple high speed connections. &quot;There was an error while attempting to install scribblenauts remix please try again&quot; WASTE OF MONEY!!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've been a casual fan of star trek for 30+ years.<br /><br />I went into this with an open mind and no expectations. What I walked out with was a smile on my face and a lot of warm memories as I tried to piece together the changes used to create this alternate timeline while still respecting the original.<br /><br />I'd call this movie a success on every level, it's well written, well acted and pays homage to its roots respectfully.<br /><br />On another note: my girlfriend has never watched star trek in her life prior to the first JJ Abrams Star Trek (2009); which I talked her into watching on DVD. So Into Darkness (2013) is only her second star trek experience. She has thoroughly enjoyed both movies and after Into Darkness shes now asked if we can start collecting the original series so she can watch everything from the beginning in order. I now have an excuse to buy all of the TV series (I already have all the movies)<br /><br />This movie has satisfied an old fan and helped create a new one, I don't think I could give it any higher praise than that so I won't even bother trying.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good graphics and instructions, easy to get around in. Takes time  unless you spend money in the same to restart energy.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Even though it's 25 years old, still a fantastic movie.  The 3D made it even more fun and exciting.  The dinosaurs are even more amazing.
B0030B621W|5.0|This film is a hidden gem. It received very limited PR, which was deceptively low profile.<br />For David Bowie fans, I will say that Duncan Jones proudly continues his father's legacy of<br />contribution to high art.
1609611543|4.0|This is a well written book and should be read by everyone who wants to lose some of that fat tummy.
B004ZQBOXC|5.0|great party music.  all of my friends and I love the CD.  love the music  AAAAA=++++  party music  crank it up
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|In my opinion this game is better then the jaws version haha the whole game is amazing I love it it is sooooo addicting
B000001ELR|5.0|What could you expect to follow up The Elder? A great album from KISS. Creatures has a lot of good stuff on it. I was a little bummed that Ace Frehley didn't play a single note on this album, but it's great none the less. Lots of great songs!
B0082Z447U|5.0|This book keeps drawing me to IT,<br />with very well written suspense. It employs an interesting technique of character perspective.
B00AG5VM7Y|5.0|This review is for the Master of Fleetwood Mac, a masterpiece no matter the media.<br /><br />The record is recognized as a masterpiece, the vinyl is great in the Master format or regular. The master looks different on my spectrum analyzer and sounds a little smoother. IMHO worth the few extra bucks if you can find one.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner followed quickly by A Thousand Splendid Suns, I was excited when I heard Khaled was writing another book. I pre-ordered and the minute it came through I started reading it. I put this book down once and that was to sleep. I love Khaled's writing ability. His stories grab you from the first sentence and you find it almost impossible to release yourself from the grip the story has on you. This particular book of his, And The Mountains Echoed, engaged me until the last page. There were so many stories in the one story and you'd sometimes forget that it was all one book. I know Kabul, I know so much of Afghanistan but I also know San Francisco Bay Area, therefore I could picture so much of what he wrote, the story made me feel like I was there. It was amazing and even though it was fiction, it could have passed as a true story but that is no different to his previous 2 books. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Khaled's previous books and liked them but also to anyone who wants a great read by an amazing author.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|This is just a fun episode of Castle. Laura Prepon shows up as the actress assigned to play Nikki Heat, the character Castle has based on Beckett, in an upcoming movie. Prepon's character wants to \\"get into Nikki Heat's skin\\" to more accurately play the part, but she ends up getting under Beckett's skin instead.

B001OI6YJI|3.0|I first saw this movie many years ago and I guess in my youth, I was impressed with the story line. However, with today's movie making technology, it sort of reminds me of the early episodes of &#34;Lost In Space&#34;.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters with mid expectations since the ratings have just been decent but i was blown away from the awesomeness of the film.  I am not a big fan of the twist but it didn't really bother me and all the bad is made up with good. The only complaint is the villian aint the best.<br />1. Iron Man 1 (10/10)<br />2. Iron Man 3 (9/10)<br />3. Iron Man 2 (8/10)
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I truly enjoyed the story as well as each of the characters who are carefully delineated both by the writer and by the actresses who portray them and bring them to life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars. Simply beautiful. John Green did an amazing job. He made each character unique, yet all relatable. It makes you reflect upon your own life. It has me balling my eyes out. This book was amazing.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I always followed the Sookie Stackhouse novels and was pleased with the direction that this book took, until I got to the end. I would have enjoyed it maybe jumping forward a year or few in the last chapter to see where the characters end up, but I guess Charlaine wrapped it up as best she could. I'll miss you Sookie...
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games. Great entertainment and a great preparation to watch the movie. I never thought that I would<br />say it but I do prefer the Kindle for PC as I connect my laptop to the big TV and read it in the comfort of my recliner.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This is a pretty good game, but I don't think it's perfected on the Android. Sometimes it'll freeze and interrupts your time a bit
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Just a fun movie to watch.  Glad to have a fresh copy, since the other one freezes up.  A great price
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love everything about it and would suggest to all to give it a try. sooo many things to look for and learn from it's tutorials.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|The quality if like watching a VHS movie, but Star Trek fans will still like the movie.  It was like a time capsule, bringing you back to the 80s.  New fans of the recent Star Trek movie will find valuable references from the original movie.  It will all make sense.
B000HX4ZF6|4.0|This movie was recommended to me by a dear friend.  It was very good, a little graphic for me but the story was good.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|My biggest complaint these days when I buy a case for my iPhone, Kindle, iPad, or other electronics is that they frequently smell bad, as in toxic.<br /><br />This one has no smell and works great.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to add much cushioning, so you'll still not want to put anything on top of it (can break the Kindle screen), but it should protect against scratches.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I would surely recommend this game to anyone. love the fact that is problem solving which is always a good thing.  Also it is not difficult to play but it's lots of fun. kind of addictive.
B009R659L8|5.0|I could not put this not put this book down!  I have read all of Ms. Clark's books and Daddy's Gone A Hunting is one of her best.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I watched this movie because it was recommended to me by a dear friend.  I loved it!!!  The music, the scenery, the story all were absolutely great!!
B0018OFN1S|4.0|You don't have to be interested in &#34;tuners&#34; to appreciate the fast-paced action and excitement in the original film that spawned the &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; string of movies. AS in most movie series, the original is the best.  The Blu-ray version provides wonderful detail and the action is non-stop.
B008FNBQAW|4.0|Of the many LW play scripts out there, I prefer this one by Emma Reeves. Good for actors from amateur to professional. A nice sized cast with a variety of ages and types. Well written and true to the original book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Having all the videos and books I don't get why the bad press on this one?  It is fine...keeps with the story and fills in some things not explained in the other movies.<br /><br />Now, when will Hollywood start doing stories IN THE RIGHT ORDER?!  (See Star Wars)
B0011Z51QG|5.0|If you are an internet Dj. or aby wedding D J.  and I do not mean the the hip hop dj.  Its almost a nessecity to have.  Like The village people, Bee Gees, and the chicken dance.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|This series is just so real.  I don't agree with the life styles portrayed by the characters because promiscuous sex never leads to lasting happiness.  That being said, the emotions portrayed, the fully fleshed characters, and a twisting, turning plot keep me watching.......laughing, crying with the characters.  This program is just so well done!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Awesome story line. Fabulous ending! Can't wait<br />To start the next book! Looking forward to more great pieces of work by Suzanne Collins.

1907947655|4.0|It would be impossible to give the story less than five stars, but in this anniversary year, I do wish it were a hardcover.<br />Happily, it's not a digitized version.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Buy it and you decide!<br /><br />Great tunes, great vocals...as usual.  Glad Joe decided to stop singing and give a real singer a shot.  This team up will rocket both careers upward and onward.<br /><br />BRILLIANT move joining forces to do what each person does best!  (Plus Beth is a HOTTIE!!)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Graphics are vivid. Game makes u think and has u embroiled in the plot.  Mickey done fireproof.  I can't until they had more chapters.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I can think of other things that are more fun but they require either booze or a girl or a TV and a large pizza.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I'm a big fan of Sophie Kinsella!  I waited a while for this book and it just didn't meet my expectations.  I'm not a harsh reviewer...I just expect a fun, funny, entertaining, light-hearted read from Kinsella and this book was just okay.
B00CMT52T6|5.0|The real hero is not the man called Mud, but a 14 year old boy, Ellis, with women trouble. His mother wants to divorce Dad, and one can easily see why. His attempts at gaining his rightful status with girls of his age suffer from his relative underdelopment: his preferred girl friend May Pearl condescends to kissing him on the cheek, because he is so sweet, but no more can be expected there. She is half a head taller and looks almost adult. Puberty is hard for boys. (Maybe for girls too.)<br />Ellis adopts the case of a fugitive killer whom he found hiding on a little island. Mud has a girlfriend, Juniper, and Ellis, the romantic white knight, wants to help the pair elope from police and a revenge posse that was put together by the father of Mud's victim. Another woman who disappoints.<br />The story explodes into much gun violence. Background  checks might have been useless in this case.<br />Not memorable enough to stay with me for long, I expect, but good enough for 4.5 stars.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Its an amazing indie film with a superb cast (Breslin, Carell, Arkin etc.)!  So real but with a warm ending!
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I have loved all the star trek series, the original, the next generation, Deep space nine, voyeger, and enterprize.  This season had T'pal, Scott Backula and trip and merriweather.  loved the episode where they first see a holo deck and trip ends up _________.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Naturally being from the 80's I like there old stuff better but this album still has a Depeche Mode sound worth checking out.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This film has attracted over 500 reviews, generally positive. I don't think I need to add anything substantial to previous praises. My motivation to watch it ( which I did alone on DVD, not in a cinema) came mostly from the cast. Helen Hunt and William Macy, mostly. The subject isn't necessarily one that might make me want to watch. Sex therapy for a paralyzed man? How can that not be sentimental and embarrassing? Well, it isn't, it is even funny, and just a little sad, but even that with an upbeat tone.<br />Nice surprise to meet Deadwood's Calamity Jane in a small role.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Not for the light hearted, a really grimy, intense drama.  Good action and plot!  Watch a few episodes before buying of course!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fantastic story was great graphics were excellant and hints kept you from getting frustrated.All in all a great adventure. I was fully entertained.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|They recently came thru town so I discovered them. They are now touring as the opener for Depeche Mode and I'm just as excited to see them as I am Depeche Mode.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is a really fun book that teaches you about Greek and roman history in a fun way. I love the book and  it is friendly for ages.
0679805273|5.0|This has been an all time favorite book of mine. I used to give to every kid I knew for graduation, from<br />kindergarten up to college.<br />Everyone should own it... it full of WISE advice.<br />Came in perfect condition and in excellent time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is a awsome game, I play with it so mutch, that I always Know what dragons will get what. P.S.I Know the combo for a moon dragon!
1451695187|3.0|Although I read the entire book, it was just too wordy...I believe, when he stayed on topic, he sent his message. I have no doubt he experienced this, but he did not delve into more  of the titles topic.
0765325950|5.0|Exaptional! One of the most engrosing end engaging fantasy world creation, climb to monumental<br />Conclusion. Extrordinery the power of this writers,there is light and its here and now,<br />thanks to both well gifted writers.a fine master work!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A great story wonderfully told and an insight in the Japanese mind. The hero and heroine are engaging and sheds light on a different time in history.
B007SGM084|4.0|I was amazed at the way the author was able to describe the very personal events of their love-making.  It was also interesting in that it kept you wanting to know what was going to be tried the next time......<br /><br />Overall, the plot was a &#34;fairy tale&#34; with very good descriptions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is so cool! I have all the mincrafts ever created now! pe xbox and computer. this game is soooooo addicting!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game. It gets more challenging as the views change.  I like the differnt formats of the games
B004YW4L5K|1.0|I seem to be in the minority on this one.  This book just kept getting worse, and when you thought it couldn't get any more disgusting...it did.  Blew me away with the level on mind-boggling grossness.  This should come with some sort of rated R warning.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I really like this game Irs super ineteresting if you liked cut the rope then you will probably like this game too
0307887960|3.0|This diet works but it is really hard for me to follow, and stay on. The shipping was good, it came within required time.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|From the perspective of a long time fan of all the ERBurroughs' Martian science fiction series, The graphics of the Tharks was especially well done per ERB's descriptions. The making of a movie usually requires variations from the original novels they are based upon; so the effort to bring in characters from later books of the series, such as the White Therns, was less than true for being just the first of many serial novel's re-creations as movies; but overall the screenwriting brought in a huge amount of new story to it all. A very enjoyable movie in its own right.
B004E10QC8|2.0|I went to youtube and found out this is just a repackaging of the remastered sets. Would it really kill these idiots who put these sets together to give us the original series in production order without the tampered with special effects?
B003TQKVGU|3.0|Its a good read, not a great one. The flow of the book and examples could have been better. T
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Purchased for my mother for a birthday gift and she loved it! She could not believe how great it was. I have not seen it but I know she enjoyed it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|O.K.,  so the whole family is addicted to this game. My eight year old helped me understand the Missions and Daily challenges. I love the graphics and look forward to the next upgrade to see where the surfers will ride.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I think this is ok for my kindle. Would love to get flash player from adobe on here, if anyone knows how please tell me
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Clever, fast-paced, well written and performed with some of the best fight scenes ever staged for a TV series. Nuanced and interesting characters, and the tone of the series is very Batman-like, with lots of easter eggs for the comics fans.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|Well known author Wilkie Collins fits right in with the classics of Dickens, Elliot and Vida Winter.  A must read for those that enjoy and study writers of this vintage
B006M4F67A|5.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong. It's a relaxing way to wind down from the day. This version has nice graphics and sound.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is extremely great! Everything you want is right on your desktop. I can't complain 😊 I would recommend to a friend
B005USZYDU|5.0|I loved the twist at the end where the judge says a mistrial. All in all, it's a good book.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|Sophie Kinsella books never fail to entertain, I thoroughly enjoyed this one as well. Although a little slow to start itbdeveloped into a cracking read
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Very good lots of action as expected since Tom Cruise was star. Was able to watch weeks before available in store.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like all the different armors that are available.  Keeps me playing so I can unlock them all!  Plus my two young sons love watching me play. :)
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Great album Huey is the best! All of the songs that she remembered were on this album. If you like Huey Buy this!
B000PWQPAC|4.0|well its was what they said it was played well and was better then I though it would be the playing not the movie love that s***
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Watched at the theater and had to own it. Even better at the house. No issues streamed perfect great quality.
B007N85POS|4.0|In HD, the graphics are quite good. The addition of life helpers is great as well. Cool that the birds take flights after rescue.
B00992CF6W|4.0|mine craft pocket edition rocks but the up date will not come out so its getting way to boring so mojang needs to hurry up now who's with me.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Brian Wilson and Beach Boys enthusiasts will love this DVD!  Have been fan of this group and it's visionary leader for a decade+ and they never cease to amaze me.  It is a MUST HAVE in your collection!
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Difficult to follow. Make sure you are not multitasking while watching this one. Put the kids to bed and make sure its quite.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I was so bored with this game. It is probably perfect for very young children. I'll have my 3 year old granddaughter try it out.
0739367676|5.0|I love these narrators.  They are very good at making the story come alive and represent all of the characters, especially Ilyana! I am sad the series is over, boooo.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|love this one as much as the other seasons. Kept ready for the next installment, due to it's action and twist and turns. Great writing and use of the dangling apple.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Missed the govanator and couldn't wait for this one to come out. Lots of action and love his manors. Brings me back to the old days.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book; it was really good. Kept me on my toes for her safety and her wanting to start new. :)
B008BU75IQ|4.0|You have to start with the first book of the series. It's about the characters - and you come to know each in depth. Two families adventures and heartaches intertwine. I pre-ordered the third book - now need the fourth book whenever it comes out.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me occupied and gives me something to do for short periods of time. Also makes the mind think and you have to look to match tiles.  that is the catch!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I have recommended this book to most of my friends.  While quite dark and deeply emotional in parts, it also brought tears of laughter to my eyes.  Harold is on a pilgrimage to save a friend, but his travels the journey also become an emotional journey of self-discovery with beautiful and touching consequences. Harold's journey is like a thread of a huge cloth, encompassing strangers, good friends, enemies, family - and a dog!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really awesome. people should give it a shot and discover the fun of it. and its free. YES!!!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|An easy read. A good plot. You have to love the boy lawyer especially his work in Animal Court whether for parrot or llama.
B0086700CM|5.0|thee most fun game ever most people say that the other temple run 2 is better than this one but no it is not they just hatting
B002TXZRNQ|2.0|I genuinely love the theme of this novel; a student, now in adulthood, learning life's greatest lesson from his ex-college lecturer.  The narrative brings us through the last few weeks of Morrie's life as he battles a fatal disease.  It has the potential to be brilliant, emotional, moving, touching - and life-changing!  It fails.  Morrie's lessons are no more than something one would read on a 'thought-a-day' calendar.  We all know one must cherish, love - and live every day.<br />As someone who has battled a serious illness and survived, I provided similar advice to my loved ones and have come to understand the meaning of life and its frailty.  I expected the lessons of life, in the form of this book, would be more articulately, and beautifully dealt with in this published story - it wasn't :(
B00CL68BK2|1.0|How this movie won any awards is beyond my comprehension. The plot was so contrived. Big disappointed. Wish I could get my five dollars and two hours back
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Absolutely chilling. Did not give it five stars because I would not recommend it to just anybody. So incredibly true-to-life it reads more like a memoir than fiction. If you have brushed up against a Lee in your own life, the hairs on the back of your neck will stand straight up. Mine did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I play it almost every day it is sooooooooooooooooooooo good:-) thank you for making the game
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|A must have for any kid collection.  Some animated movies get annoying to listen to, but this one I don't mind.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, but it would be nice if it lasted longer. It ended just when it was getting good.
B004A8ZYZE|5.0|I recommend this book. The more people who read this book and use the ideas the better we will be. Please, no more bludgeoning me to death with monotone, boring presentations \\"supported\\" by a slide deck full of bulleted lists and enough text to be considered a novel. I will no longer tolerate giving or receiving this type of presentation. Read the book, take the advice, and get out there and communicate!
1934356476|4.0|There are lots of nits to pick with this book, and other reviewers have done a good job with them.  The quasi-Socratic Dialogues with Bill are weird, the fanboy relationship with the Ruby language is a little fulsome, blah, blah...<br /><br />But after reading a half-dozen of the most widely-recommended Ruby texts, this one was still the only one that really made me feel like I had improved my feel for the how and the why of Ruby's really deep magic.  Ruby is a perfectly fine scripting language if one just takes it as it is -- easily up to any task you could hand to its brethren, Perl and Python.  But Ruby lets you get inside the language, and write programs that modify themselves at runtime, in ways that can boggle your mind.  This book explains how you do that, why you'd do it, and shows prominent real-world examples of the techniques in the wild.<br /><br />Although this book covers language fundamentals pretty well, it might not make a great first Ruby book.  But I think lots of programmers would speed up their learning curve by making this their second Ruby book -- it's really the one that \\"gets\\" Ruby.  \\"Metaprogramming\\" makes it sound like there's a specific task that the book teaches, but really, it's just a thorough explanation of how the Ruby universe is constructed.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Had not seen this movie in a long time, but still a very emotional watch and would recommend a second viewing.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  As the author switched back and forth between India and the US, the reader was kept up to date on the happenings within both families.  As the book progressed, I tended to imagine different endings - none of which turned out to be what actually happened.  Don't want to say much more so as not to spoil the book for others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best app ever the graphic are amazing even though I know I cant get a real horse I can always play my horse
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|It was good to see Arnold back again.  He is not as buff as he used to be, but he does still have that screen presence.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I saw the movie Emma and this series fallowed the story closely.  (I did think that Tony Collette was a better Harriet Smith).
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Slick Retro game that is just plain fun to play. Melting Pot of old space shooter games. Controls are nice and responsive whether touch or tilt. Simple permissions. Need more developers with this mindset. Just straight fun pick up and play. No daily stuff and no iap.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app actually worked very well. I have had some trouble with the battery draining, but the alarm works perfectly and I love the weather feature.
B002NXZY8K|5.0|if you love Sorcese, you love Casino...  not the most warm and fuzzy treatment of the chicago mob in the 60s and 70s but lets face it, not the warmest and fuzziest people to be dealing with on a day to day basis if you were in the thick of it.  Damn fine film and while not as groundbreaking as Goodfellas, every bit as entertaining, as it were.  Does have the capability of leaving one cold.
B00BY7NK96|4.0|Through all the career choices I've made (so far) -and there's been a few! - I can see now how slight changes in behaviour, attitude and confidence, as illustrated in Lean In, may have more positively affected my view of myself, my colleagues and managers (both male and female), and my &#34;mentors&#34;. I am filled with optimism and fire that women will create positive change foe the future of leadership, and I'm certainly seeing myself Lean In, and encouraging others to do so too. This is a truly fresh view on leadership, supported by a great online community (as you would expect!) and I'll be paying my copy of this forward.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is a treasure. It should be taught in every school. Thank you Orson Scott Card, for this wonderful novel
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I love every piece of music on this cd. It's sensual but relaxing also. My favorite, which I'm sure everyone else says too is Spem in Alium. But not when I read 50 Shades, I can picture each piece of music and hear it playing. Looking forward to the movie next year!! Routing for Ian Somerhalder to Play Christian Grey!!
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|Very elaborate and thoughtful treatment of this crazy horrific topic.  No blood and guts slasher film, all thought with ultra 70s treatment -- authentic through and through...  fantastic film.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is the second book I am reading by this author. The first was Let's Get Visible. I think what this author does best is compile a lot of current information into one place. And it is so well-written and easy-to-read. He gives a historical context for everything as well as personal experience and real-world examples. I have to credit Gaughran (sp?)for making complex theories and ideas very simple to understand and not intimidating. There are a lot of great links in this book worth clicking on *and* all of the important ones are listed again at the back in a resource section so you find them again and again. I can't say enough about how empowered this book makes me feel. I love all of the stories from successful authors but I also love all of the technical information that one needs about: taxes, copyrights, ISBN numbers, formatting, cover design, editing, and the list goes on and on. This book was worth every single penny. I will recommend it to anyone who is considering publishing an e-book - that is highest praise I can give. Worth of mouth.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I just saw the movie and that was great. I found out that there was a game out for the kindle and now I am excited. Now I get to play the epic game!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Interesting story line, dystopian society coming of age book. Lena is a strong character in a world of adversity. Looking forward to want will happen in Pandemonium.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Stupid story of seems of a another famous erotic romance trilogy.  Same story except the girl has blonde hair and the man has black hair.
B00821OX98|4.0|We just started watching it but we are finding it entertaining so far.  Hopefully it ends up with more storyline than killing aliens.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play this game every day and its very addicting. And even though I usually don't spend money on apps I will buy extra credits sometimes.
0545265355|5.0|I read HG in 4 days after watching the movie and still had a few small suprises. Once i made it to Catching Fire i couldnt put it down and finished it in a day. Mokingjay is a different piece all together and i believe has an incredible yet very realistic climax and conclusion. My mother is now reading them and next my wife and daughter. A must read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had heard so many mixed reviews on this book. Most of them were good.. So I bought it for my kindle.. I started reading  it... And let me tell you.. It was a page turner!! I did not want to put it down.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I had gotten this app awhile ago as the FAOTD. I didn't realize then how lucky I was. As a therapist, this program allows me to work on the go so I don't need to be tied down to my home computer thereby increasing my productivity. I can write a report anywhere!
B0091REZMW|5.0|once you start playing you will get hooked.  And it has plenty of different things to do.  Very cool game.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Super cult hiper movie, christianity persecuted by civilized word... State of the art, hd restored, bargain price! EVERYONE MUST SEE!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is simple and entertaining. It is a good value for the fun you will get playing it. Fun story and also educational
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Lightning Thief is a great book.A story for anyone who likes adventure,magic ,suspense,heroes,betrayal and greek mythology.THE LIGHTNING THIEF is awesome!!!
B002361MLA|2.0|I didn't finish the book because it made me feel more anxious reading it than I did before. Good points but didn't resonate with me.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is very well written, in simple English. The probability of Anita's experience are credible and a good indicator of the life hereafter. Well done.
0307474259|5.0|Good common sense book on nutrition and a deep understanding of truly Why we get fat. Cleared up a few questions I haven't been able to have answered before. Good read -
B007SGM084|5.0|I could read these books over ad over. I didn't want the store line to end. I give this 5 stars! Love all the suspense. The sexual side was very educational and fun.!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love this so much information!  This was recommended by a good friend.  I can't  help but check it out every.<br />day.  Looking forward to many hours of use. Thank you.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|My hubby is a musician, so I hear an awesome amount of music of all types.  The fact that I can listen to the whole album without wanting to skip or change to something different after my favorites are done playing. A most excellent musical endeavor.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|My impression for a YouTube app would be to pick out what you want to see instead of making a choice based on the maker's choices. I am highly unhappy because the choices are so limited and not based on my preferences.
1401322786|1.0|This book was too far out.  I forced myself to read it to the end just out of principle.  I looked for some saving grace but couldn't find any other than this writer has quite an imagination.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and neither would anyone in my book club.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I downloaded this game less than a week ago and I can't stop playing it. It's such a simple game, but oddly fun.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|The best book I've read for a long time. Very imaginative. Full of enjoyable sub-themes. Compulsive reading, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the next installment.
0439023491|5.0|I don't know whether to read it all in a day or take my time.<br />It's nerve wrecking!!<br />Can't wait to start the 3rd. one
B008LP8QE8|1.0|This is the best textbook in internal medicine. We wish to buy kindle only if text to speech is enabled. KIndly request the publisher.<br /><br />Dr.B.Soma Raju
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has further character development on both groups of people. I loved it all but the last 2 minutes.<br />Lela
B00992CF6W|4.0|Although he says it is a 4 not a 5, but engaging.  He enjoys figuring out the materials he needs to build different structures.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Great app to find ratings from other fellow travelers on hotels, plus their comments are very helpful, especially if they had a good time or not
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I forgot the size of the HVAC filters. Evernote has them.<br />What is the email address of my second Kindle? It's in Evernote.<br />What are the five steps to...? Evernote has it.<br /><br />I use it daily. Saves time, avoids frustration.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Yes, I hate being hooked on a TV program, but this has it all. People you love; people you love to hate; drama; humor. Count me in. This is like being a fly on the wall 100 years ago.<br />Lela
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was kinds hoping for different skins in this one, but being able to save worlds is good enough for me!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good and easy to move around. I had a hard time getting it to load it took a day but now it works great no problem s.
B004TI1WME|5.0|My favorite part about this app is the &#34;virtual tape.&#34; I use it primarily for balancing my checkbook and I can double check my entries on the tape.  Highly recommend it for everyday calculations.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This bingo is awesome but why does it go so fast when last ball is called not enough time to daub if u have bingo
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I finished this book wanting more.  I had no idea the book was short stories.  Mini interviews from all over the world from people who experienced the war with not only the dead, but what else  \\"Z\\" created!!!! If you love \\"The Walking Dead\\", this will help you get a fix until the next season.
B000002MJC|5.0|Depeche Mode is my favorite band of all time. This particular CD is my favorite one. It has multiple hite and even some unknown jewels. You'll adore it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I like stories of coming up out of nothing.  I wish I had a list(dictionary) of the meanig for every flower.  This was a good example of forgiveness and redemption
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|If you like Jack London's work, and you like some naturalist literature, you will like this book. Personally, it is one of my favorites.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Charges my Nexus 7, Galaxy S2, and iPhone 5 without any problems. However, the only problem I've had is the charger lacking connection to the socket at times. Some mild road bumps can make the device loose. Thus, not allowing my devices to charge.<br /><br />Overall, decent product.
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I bought this CD specifically for two songs but I enjoyed it. I am sure you will like it as well.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble just gets more and more comfortable in his own skin and utilizing his smooth tones!<br />And what a marketing genius to select songs that are great to sing along to but also appeal to his massive fan club of &#34;Baby Boomers&#34;! Right on, Mr Michael Buble!!
B0012QVJXS|3.0|Seeing this film as a child and then seeing it as a 38 year old are two different experiences. This film is not nearly as pragmatic as modern films. The villains are bland as Jay-Z's 300th song about how good he is at rhyming words together. No wonder they've been rebooting it. Christopher Reeve isn't a terrible Superman though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Noooo! But yay for Peeta! So glad it was him and not Gale! I wanted to shake Katniss through this whole trilogy!
B000002L9M|5.0|Even after all these years, I still love it as much today as I did when it was new. Always a pleasure.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Jack is very likable. Everyone understands being bored with the same old thing day after day. It is visually stunning. The day glow colors used in the Oogey Boogey scenes are eye catching. The Christmas town scenes are wonderful. The songs are great. The Halloween song has been covered by several bands. So, great we start Halloween with this movie every year and take it out again during Christmas.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that sub way suffers is a really great game to play. Its soo much fun and young ones will love it. If you like temple run you'll like this.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have followed Kathy Reichs for a number of reasons.  Her wrting is exceptional & her storylines are very interesting.
B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|Pink Floyd is always good listening. Yes it is a strange one but it is also a good one. Have fun.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I watched this movie years ago. Ralph Lauren did the costumes for this movie. I went to see the new version and watched it again to compare. Mia Farrow is like a moving mannequin and then she ruins a scene that she totally overreacts on. Robert Redford under acts the scene but Leo does it just right. It is the confrontation scene with Tom in the hotel room. Mia Farrow just trashed that scene. Robert Redford is a good Gatsby but Mia Farrow is a horrible Daisy. The viewer can almost see Redford is annoyed with her. The new version starts out a cartoony but Leo saves it. This version Redford is the star and does all he can do with his lame Daisy.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is all about my wife (Pam) and I support her watching it as long as she does it on her Ipod in the bed after I am asleep, hee hee.  I am &#34;allowing&#34; her to watch it on the big screen too, just as long as I am not in my recliner.  I am such a chauvinist!  Really, I hate this type of old British soap opera drama (e.g Pride and Prejudice.)  But my wife hates to give reviews (to much like work) so I will be writing the review for her.  Sort of like having the Devil be the Travel Agent selling you the virtues of going to Heaven.  Zowser!<br />So let get started, shall we.<br />Pam likes the characters,  &#34;it was nice to see the female characters be independent for that period of time&#34; ( I think that the women in this town should have slit the men's throats in their sleep just for being such pigs) The show depicts the real struggle of the working class, they never knew where their next meal will come from,  sometimes they had no shoes.  The people in the story felt real to Pam.  She always looks forward to the next episode to see what is going to happen to the people in the village {sort of like the TV show, Gilligan's Island, but I am too critical).  She highly recommends this series, I highly recommend developing the habit of drinking Whiskey.  Or maybe seperate Big-Screen TVs with wireless headphones for each person.  Good luck with that.<br />Adrian
0938045695|5.0|I was introduced to Kettlebells about 3 years ago by my now Brother-in-Law.  He had competed in a few Ironmans and due to a back injury could no longer run. I was overcoming a severe shoulder injury and also have significant back problems. He mentioned that he uses kettlebells and is now stronger and in better condition than when he was running 80 miles per week. He told me to purchase Pavel's Enter The Kettlebell and \\"forget everything I had done up till now.!\\"<br /><br />I was leaving the military after almost two decades and it had taken it's toll on my body.  I was a wrestling coach and have lifted weights for over 30 years so going into the fitness world was a perfect fit. But I wasn't sure of how I would hold up with all the wear and tear on my body.  Traditional workouts were killing me.  Then, I opened the book...<br />I was skeptical but once I started reading, it just clicked. The ideas were incredible. The concept of Greasing the Groove was the opposite of traditional western wisdom.  I started the program minimum and was shocked at the results. I felt great!  I was gaining range of motion back in my shoulder and strengthening my postieror chain like never before! I took my time and did the drills to perfect the swing and the Get-up. The instructions make sense and are easy to follow. I know others may not agree but Pavel's sense of humor really makes the process easier and more enjoyable!<br /><br />This was my first introduction to kettlebells and lead me to the HKC Certification! I am working on becoming a RKC instructor in the near future!<br /><br />I can not recommend this book enough!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I enjoyed Revenge, because of the suspense, drama, and mystery.  It always kept you thinking what was going to happen next and I was thoroughly surprised every time.  The secrets of Emily Thorne were kept by those who helped her.  The loyalty of those friends was portrayed very well.  The ending of this season makes me anxious for next year's program.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|The viewer really gets to like Alexander Supertramp. The guy was fearless. He shook off his upper middle class upbringing. The movie has a scene where his family is at dinner. It seems to blame his attitude on his parent's divorce. He is beaten at one point and mistreated due to being a homeless person. He goes into the Alaska wilderness not well equipped and lives in a van. I won't spoil the ending but I really liked this character even if at times I was horrified by his choices.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It's nice.  I'm not sure if I like it a bunch or love it.  Fun puzzles and simple rules.  The art is nice too.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is simply the best game on a phone that I've ever played. Retro, old style entertainment with excellent controls.  Bravo.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I always play this game on my phone and I was so happy when it came out on my kindle fire! I love buying new cars and backgrounds! I recommend using the monster truck on the moon! It gives u a lot of coins!
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|This is a fun ride similar to when Johnny Depp did Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The scenery has upgraded to a beautiful island. Hunter S. Thompson had an interesting life that deserves at least two movies and a documentary Johnny Depp narrated. My favorite scene was the homemade flame thrower! The Scarlett Johanson look a like wasn't bad to look at with the always handsome Mr. Depp (well on screen anyway).
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. it has so many creative ideas, and helps out with crafts or dinner. the only problem I have with it so far is it closes about every 30 minutes. other then that its great!
0375842209|3.0|The first time I started the book I found it difficult to get into. I spoke with a friend who was farther into it (we are reading it for our book club) and I am glad I gave it a second chance.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|I know it's derivative (Smallville, Lost), and has holes in the plot a mile wide (let's kiss long and love-y during a disaster), but...  I just can't stop enjoying it.  I missed several episodes on Hulu, so it was worth it to me to buy them.  Sometimes my mind needs to chill out, and let my reptile brain go to town.
B000ID1J0E|4.0|Watching the movie was like being in a dream. It is a wild ride. Johnny Depp does a great job as his personal friend Hunter S. Thompson.
1616960922|5.0|Though most of the books I read are for entertainment, some provide something beyond; This novella is one of them. It kept me guessing till the very end, and although I had my suspicions of how it might end, the author did a wonderful job putting the pieces of the story together. Made me think of human life, people, art and choices. I know it's rather vague, but I don't want to add spoilers. Just let me say it kept me awake deep into the night, at the edge of my seat, with a huge grin when I reached the last page.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Predictable and kind of boring, but the kids enjoyed most of it.<br />Cgi animals were more creepy than cute<br /><br />I did love the fear and loathing nod at the beginning though
B007FROH4G|3.0|This is not a happy book,and it shouldn't be.  But it should not read like a medical textbook because this is the story of so many real people. I so wanted to take this author by the hand and send her back to the drawing board, and tell her that Alice deserves a better creator. My heart aches for Alice, and it aches for the fact that this book is so poorly written in places that it interrupts the story. This is a decent novel that shines line upon a disease that is still not much discussed today, but the mechanics of the writing let it down.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is comprised of six different stories in different literary genres. Each story has the same all star cast playing a character in each one. There was a sick lawyer on a ship. There was a love story about a composer. The thriller or suspense story of sorts about older people in a nursing home. A mystery with a reporter. A sci-fi story about a clone revolution. A sci-fi story about a people looking for a home planet. Wow, the viewer has to pay attention. The movie flips from story to story. It does not get dull. There is just too much going on. I can't wait to read the book and see how this is done in writing. It is a breath of fresh air to watch a movie that the viewer does not have the entire plot ironed out from the trailer.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|People stop letting your kids write reviews. They say the book is great, but give it two stars. And their grammar and spellingarr horrible and I'm a sixth grader.
B004XE0TDW|3.0|Even after running a carbon fiber brush over the album, it still would pop and crackle. I'm going to try washing it, but it shouldnt sound this bad for a new album. The fleet fox album that I got brand new at the same time did not have this problem. I love the Bon Iver album, but not the crackling and popping.
1451675046|5.0|One of those rare books you wish everyone should read, but even rarer is the beleif that everyone would understand it! Dawkins ability to construct prose so intriquing, amusing and logically bulletproff is a unique talent. I bought his book first as a Kindle book but then bought two printed copies as gifts to my children.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I really loved this movie! I think it is the best movie I've seen  the avengers also really enjoyed it, but I am an Iron Man fan also.
0783226063|1.0|Don't buy the \\"extended\\" reproduction (Alan Smithee) of the original theatrical release, it is virtually unwatchable, and a waste of money. No wonder David Lynch refused to acknowledge his participation. If I could give Zero stars I would.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I am a huge fan of Paramore, and this is their best album by far in my opinion. It's so different from their previous music, but it's refreshing and a lot of fun to listen to!<br /><br />I ordered it on Tuesday, and it arrived in the mail on Friday on time. It was packaged in bubble wrap, and the CD and casing was in perfect condition.<br /><br />I also got free mp3 downloads of the entire album included for free with my purchase, so it's a real bargain for only $12! I definitely recommend buying from here!
B000KADH2S|5.0|When I was taking my first Psychology class in college, my professor introduced me to this book: Man's Search for Meaning. Since then, it has been for me one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it three times already at three different periods of my life. I have always found strength and courage to keep going. When people ask me why I like to read books about the Holocaust, I always respond because they teach me so much about living. I admire their endurance and their fearless actions.<br />I love this book because Viktor Frankl taught us so much about how love can conquer all. My favorite quote from the book is from Nietzsche: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.\\"<br /> As I am writing this review, I feel the urge to read it again. I know I always deepen it more - each time I read it.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It was a fun game to kill some time. The best part was it was free. Finished in about 2 days. :)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|So beautifully developed.  The characters lives really connect from past to present, and everything makes sense.  I could not stop reading.  I will look for more books from this author.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I enjoyed the book but I prefer watching the show. You could visualize each character as you read. All in all, a good read.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It will only let you play for about 45 minutes to an hour before you have to pay $1.99 for the full game. I will say I think the full game is worth it.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I'd never read this style before and absolutely loved it! Blade and Honor are the best characters!! I this so far in the series Blade is my favorite!!! Yes, I messed up and read in the wrong order! LOL But other than that , it's a great stand alone story too! Loved it!!!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|What a great choice I made in purchasing my first Joe Monamassa CD, plus, I got two CDs in this purchase.  I have both CDs on my CD player and when each of them come around to play, I tune out everything else going on and listen.  Am I pleased with this purchase?  Yes!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|it was great! fast paced and super interesting! I'm now a huge fan of Hugh Howey and will be reading all his other books!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Incredible storytelling. Unique, creative, grand in scope. I loved the twists and turns, not knowing who was good, who was bad- having u identify with all sides.  Exceptional!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I'm using this on my kindle, and it's a great clock to have especially when I'm traveling (a backup is always good!), has a lot of options and good sound levels.
B00000420F|5.0|I love this CD.  I play it almost daily, even though I do not understand the words.  This CD recording is on another level than listening to words.  I can feel my body relax as soon as the music begins and then there is Cecilia with her unbelievable voice.<br /><br />I sometimes play it as I go to sleep.  Low volume, for relaxing and sleep to high during the day and lifting one up to a smile.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. I can play when every I have free time,and don't have to worry losing play when I need to go.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is a really good !!!!<br />Keeps you coming back for more, it continues where the book Beautiful Creatures left off.
B003V1WUKS|1.0|I could never get into the story. There was no character development or cohesive structure to the book. Very hard to follow what I imagine were supposed to be short stories.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn't know much about this era and the amazing story of how the 6 Americans who had fled the Embassy prior to the takeover escaped.  Very well done - acting and directing.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|What more can I say about Michael Buble!!  There are so many oldie but goodie selections on this CD.  They are done in the \\"Buble\\" style.  It is so good to relax and listen or drive and listen.  It is soothing, relaxing GOOD music.  Not loud, obnoxious, angry and overpowering.  His music makes me happy or brings back great memories - sometimes sad memories.  In any event, I love his style, his class and his CHARM!!!!!
1476729719|5.0|I have been in similar situations with a son, I could identify with the subject in a close way,..the family reactions..and especialy the father. it made made a strong inpact on me personaly bmj
0802798225|4.0|Perfect chemistry was recommended off a review I read and I think it was a great read. Fast paced I finished it in two hours. Brittany's the perfect girl who gets paired with a Mexican gang boy named Alejandro (or Alex for short) for the entire senior year in Chemistry. This book has all the lines of good girl and bad boy fall for each other. Great ending, I'll definitely try another of her books!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Was a bit slow going at the start but I knew nothing about it. Once it got going was a fabulous story well told.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a fun game. It has  flaws what game doesn't.... get the game. It is really hard to get to the next stage and new vehicles.
1449410243|5.0|I was in tears laughing while reading this gift for my dad, it's all absolutely true!  The 'Bobs' cracked me up, exactly the type of workplace that is too common.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good read and heart wrenching with emotions high. Enjoyed the depth of the way Connor expressed himself. I would recommend this book!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|There is no plot, only a sad attempt to inject the usual \\"humor\\" from this group into a difficult subject.
B0073COMUW|5.0|No complaints ... replaced 4 50 watt orange incandescent over bath room make up mirror. Cheaper to run & four LED'are too many only use two now.<br />The 'daylight' color is a pleasant & positive lighting change.
0446691437|5.0|I reread this book and listened to the audio version as well because the struggle remains. Having ideas is easy. Executing them not so.<br /><br />Steven Pressfield describes this as a constant fight against the resistance and that is sure what it feels like. It is a motivating read and helps you to keep fighting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is very fun and very good! I definitely recommend that you try this great game. It is very addicting.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game.  It is very entertaining and challenging!  Sometimes too challenging.  It takes a while to complete some of the levels, but that keeps the challenge going.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love Twitter, use it all the time, it runs fine on my new Kindle.  Still working out the kinks of the keyboard mode on my new Kindle, but other than that, Twitter runs great on it.
B004PGO25O|4.0|It is more practical than his previous work. Stop over thinking and start doing.<br /><br />For someone who needs constant motivation it is a short book that I will come back to every once in a while.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Best Slender game on the market. But first off when ever u hit the third page DO.NOT.TURN.AROUND! Slendy in this one is hardcore. Once he appeared when i first spawned and i was like What the heck!? Come on Slendy i wasnt prepared yet lol<br />Its a great game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Bravo to Imangi Studios for the beautiful graphics! Hours of endless fun. The course is never the same and there is a new challenge every turn. 10 times better than original. No purchasing is necessary or required and challenging for everyone!!! For all ages. Little kids will enjoy the colors and graphics while others will be immersed in entertainment!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Longtime Angry Birds player, Angry Birds runs great on my new Kindle, which I found to my great relief. Yay!
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Creative spin on vampires and werewolves that goes outside the norm. I've grown accustomed to the poorly edited ebooks with storylines filled with holes that this rare find was a breath of fresh air. Descriptive, well-rounded characters and a realistic point of view makes this a fluid read. Thank you Bec McMaster for such a well written book!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I think that this is a game that has been very well self explanatory about something like an app that is very
B001KZG99A|5.0|great acting, good start of story like the graphic , now will see the remaining one . The movie from amazon was flawless , great picture
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is the best device app for viewing PDF files IMHO. It will come in very handy for viewing my documents in my cloud storage.
B00CNZ17DO|5.0|I have been a fan of this band since their first album (Runnin' Wild).  I've read all the criticism about them being \\"AC/DC wannabes.\\"  But, I disagree.  Yes, they are obviously strongly influenced by AC/DC and you can hear it in the music.  But, so what?  A lot of great bands show a strong influence by earlier great bands.  This band takes that influence and makes it their own.  It's just 80's style hard rocking, head banging, and fun.  No ballads or wimpy love songs...just driving rock rhythms.<br /><br />In my opinion, Airbourne's first album was great and fun to listen to but lacked a bit of studio polish.  It was a bit raw...with more of a first take, live performance sound than a polished studio album.  Their second album (No Guts. No Glory) was a lot more polished and even better than the debut.  The same hard rocking sound, but cleaner and crisper.  This third album continues that progression.<br /><br />There are several really good songs on this album.  But, I'm glad I got the Special Edition version as I think \\"You Got the Skills (to Pay the Bills)\\" and \\"Party in the Penthouse\\" are two of the better songs on the album.  My favorite is \\"Live it Up.\\"  Ironically, my least favorite is the title track, \\"Black Dog Barking.\\"  It is still a good tune, just (IMHO) not as good as others.<br /><br />So, if you like hard rocking with strong guitar riffs, driving drum beats, and screaming vocals, give this band a listen.  They are not AC/DC, but I think they are as good as or better than Rhino Bucket or any other of the more recent followers of the AC/DC genre.
B002U6CJCO|5.0|Van Damme is always good but I liked the first one better. Still well worth watching and/or adding to your collection
0446580848|5.0|I learned so much about alqiuda (sorry for the spelling)  I also have a grandson in Afghanistan at this time as a contractor and it told me about the country and people.  I feel like this country hasn't changed in 2000.  I am sure that the story line is not straying from the way life really is over there.  I will wait patiently for his next book.
B005HJ6MRO|3.0|Only used it briefly to test the cloud apps for Kindle then deleted it-- really can't form an opinion on it yet.
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a delightfully funny and honest book!  Hearing the story from Drew's point of view, and how his reasoning works was so remarkably refreshing from the sulking girl norm.<br /><br />I especially like that the book started with the sulky drew, and then went on to tell the story to how he got there.  He's so refreshingly funny, competitive, a real guy's guy, that I had bouts of tummy aching laughter at Drew and Kate's antics at the office.  The books conclusion was an unexpected turn of events, an just added more charm to the book.  Well done Emma, I think I'll stick around for more of your stories, for sure!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very similar to Temple Run 2 and equally as exciting & fun! The graphics are cute & the app can be very addictive! The kids love it!!!
B00125WAWS|5.0|Denzel of course always has great movies, but I liked this one because he taught young people to have faith in themselves and always strive to do their best. Great movie.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Good alarm app, but I deleted it-- I was looking for something that I could use with internet radio channels-- I could only use this one with device-stored music files.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I had tears reading this, but also joy at the ending, not to give it away.  Beautifully written, and the reader could visualise the background and characters perfectly.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I know there is not much that has to be said about any agry bird app...they are all great fun!!
6305128952|5.0|Wonderful movie for the whole family.  Showed patience in teaching how to do things that are hard to learn and feel good about doing.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love Tunein, it is my favorite online audio streaming app of choice.  Favorites, local stations that simulcast to internet, etc. Oh and did I mention it also allows setting up custom streaming channels that are not in the Tunein database yet? COOL!
B007G92QGO|5.0|I thought this book was well written and very thought provoking right through. The element of suspense was held throughout the<br />book right through to the end. Overall very good and would like to read more from this author as this is my first book that I have read by him.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a really cute app....fun for all ages!! Entertaining & challenging! I recommend this for family gatherings etc...let the family compete in Fruit Ninja skills!

B008B37C8Q|5.0|Ah yes, spring of 1968, mid-way through high school. Riding with my peers in our minister's van to the Methodist Youth Fellowship convocation in Ocean City, NJ, me and my best friend singing the entire album (except for the musique concrète piece at the end) all the way down; going to the Church Retreat in the Jersey Pines with my portable stereo, not only blasting this album out the window, but detaching the speakers and extending the wires so we could put them in the ceiling of the room next door where the most conservative minister in the district was staying and playing it at 3 in the morning (along with such goodies as Absolutely Free's \\"Brown Shoes Don't Make It\\"); naming our home room teacher \\"Bow Tie Daddy\\", not just because he did in fact wear a bow tie, but because as we rode in the school bus we saw him coming out of the downtown bar at 7 AM (q.v. the line \\"Just go on with your drinking\\"), and laughing at the fact that by the end of the school year everyone, including the other faculty, was calling him Bow Tie Daddy without really understanding the full significance of the name; looking at the hippie wanna-be's in the school with the words of \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps\\" going through our heads...no album I have every owned is so inextricably intertwined with the experiences of the times, and even now I will at times put it on, sing along, and wallow in the nostalgia (both good and bad). And apart from the social memories, the use of cut-and-paste editing, oddly altered vocals, the afore-mentioned musique concrète (\\"Chrome Megaphone Of Destiny\\"), the interspersed spoken/whispered bits - all these things were cutting-edge in rock music at the time (\\"Revolution Number Nine\\" came out many months later). Yes, if you were there, then you get it: the skewering of both the naive idealism of the hippies and the violent push-back of the establishment, as well as the stretching of ostensibly \\"popular\\" music into a mind-expanding (no drugs required) experience. A true masterpiece of its time.<br /><br />But what if you WEREN'T there? Is this simply what John Lennon called \\"newspaper writing\\" - taking the current headlines and writing songs about them? What if you are 20 or 30, and couldn't care less about the old cultural phenomenon of \\"psychedelic dungeons popping up on every street - go to San Francisco\\"? What if the production that was so revolutionary at the time is clumsy and so been-there-done-that compared to modern experimental music? Is there anything here for you? Well, as far as the music/production, probably not. But the lyrical themes? While songs like the afore-mentioned \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps\\", \\"Absolutely Free\\", and \\"Flower Punk\\" may seem as firmly cemented in the times as any Al Jolson song, does it only take a substitution of a modern fad name for the old one to realize that in so many ways nothing has changed? When \\"Concentration Moon\\" sings, \\"American dream, prisoner: lock - smash every creep in the face with a rock\\", would the Occupy protestors disagree? When \\"Mom and Dad\\" observes \\"You'll sit home and drink all night, they looked too weird it served them right\\", do you think you're reading this morning's right-wing blog? And, not to keep the observations to one side of the political spectrum, do the lines \\"There will come a time when everybody who is lonely will be free to sing and dance and love, There will come a time when every evil that we know will be an evil that we can rise above\\" (\\"Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\\") sound like the modern slacker who puts a vague slogan of hope and change above work and ambition? Really, what about it?<br /><br />When the album was originally released, the cover stated, \\"This whole monstrosity was conceived and executed by Frank Zappa as a result of some unpleasant premonitions.\\" The first CD release in 1985 added the line, \\"All premonitions continuing to come true.\\" Was he wrong? Are you willing to not get caught up in the 60's references and see the all-too-familiar underlying culture wars - and rot? Are you willing to take the chance of having \\"the name of your crime carved on your back\\"? Is it \\"intellectually and emotionally accessible for you\\"? Is it \\"maybe even right down your alley\\"? (With a nod to \\"Freak Out\\"). Do you feel lucky? Well do you, punk? Then take a chance. Maybe the chamber is empty. Maybe it's better if it isn't. (Yeah, I'm mixing references, but if it fits...)<br /><br />NOTE: This, the 2012 reissue, or the second Ryko reissue (the 1995 single-disc edition) are the ones to get, as they are the original 1968 version. The first CD reissue, the 1985 two-fer combining \\"Only Money\\" and \\"Lumpy Gravy\\" has the redone bass and drums, and should be avoided like the plague!!!

B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of the best RPGs ever if you have a vita you have to buy this game it's that good and there's an anime of the game and that's good too but play the game first
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Love it! Have always loved this app & really appreciate it on my Kindle Fire!!! Fantastic & loads of Fun!!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Hosseini has a few unexpected plot twists here and there that can come off as over the top, but his writing immerses the reader in the world and day to day lives of the characters.<br /><br />It's captivating, disheartening, and inspiring all at the same time.<br /><br />It's a great book that I would recommend to anyone. It's educational about the struggles and ups and downs that women face in the Middle East. The scenery and the line about a thousand splendid suns is beautiful to imagine.<br /><br />It's a great, great book!
B00BESCUKK|4.0|Since it's Tarantino, it has its own style.  More sex and gore than average person may appreciate in this cut.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Pretty good book, it was a little slow to me because it didn't completely grab my attention until around the middle of the book. I thought I wouldn't be able to put it down but it fell short for me. It was still a great story overall though not as predictable as it seems to start off. It has lots officially little twist throughout. The characters curse a lot too so if you don't like that you might not like the book as much.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I just love the challenges Cut the Rope has....it reminds me that sometimes the simple plan is the better plan!! Really love how simple the graphics are...reminds me of the original gaming days!
1592289444|5.0|The longest walk is likely the most amazing feat of endurance. First escaping from a prison camp. the walking across Siberia and into Mongolia. Crossing the Gobi Desert and eventually ascending and descending the Himalayas to reach India.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Buble's voice is as warm and wonderful as always.  This collection consists of upbeat arrangements, with none of the ballads at which Buble excels.  The only real issue is the quality of the production and the arrangements, which tend to be choppy and lack balance between the vocals and the very brassy-sounding instrumentals.  It's impossible to mess up Buble's voice, so I still recommend the album, but hope he'll quickly issue another collection of Great American songbook tunes.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|very handy in transferring my slides to digital.  It is a safer way to store all the slides taken over the years
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Beautiful and funny game, i love that Sci Fi graphics, make me remember my old times<br /> Sir developed, we need more games like that :-)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yes, it's expensive for an app, but its totally worth it. I was very skeptical at first but it is so fun!!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have had the free version for a while now. I have had many hour of enjoyment. I would recommend it to any one.
B003UBTX6S|1.0|the first book had captured me through the magic aspect but started turning me down a path of distaste. not worth reading and im slightly offended on the portrayal of teenage emotion that was in my eyes misrepresented.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I am astonished at this app.  The graphics are incredible and the animations are smooth and realistic.  I am playing on a Kindle Fire HD and have experienced no lag or response issues.  It looks, sounds, and reacts like a real Pinball machine.  Amazing.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Worth the time and money. Tina fey has a delightful narrating voice and style. I would read anything written by her.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I have read the book and watched the movie several times and it is still one of my favorite books
B00821OW8K|5.0|Keep reading my RECANT below>>>>>Hi all, I recently purchased the entire first season of Falling Skies, first of all the wording on Amazon was confusing, I thought it said 2 hour Season premier for $1.99, so I thought this must be the movie before the mini-series began. But I was dumbfounded when I learned (after calling Amazon) in actuality you have to purchase each episode for $1.99, after speaking and reviewing the customer service, she also agreed it was misstated and could see how it can be read this way. Well I buckled, I purchased the entire season with the blessing of Amazon on a discounted price.<br />Unfortunately when I reached #3, I was lost and not interested any longer and called back for a full refund. In a word HORRIBLE!!!, I expected in the line of Steven Spielberg's Taken, which is a down right EXCELLENT mini series with all the drama, intensity, and wonderful acting with a great storyline, much more believable and thought provoking than Falling Skies, and yet CGI was incredible it didn't look 'cartonoish' and unbelievable as it did in Falling Skies. Falling Skies was not worth the anticipation its getting for the release of its DVD. On Monday TNT will have a non-stop all day showing of this mini series and the following I think will be June 4, 2013.<br /><br />I thought the acting was shotty, and the whole viewing experience did not drag me in as in the classic Taken by director Steven Spielberg. It felt cheaply made, and the acting was not believable and intense as it was in Taken. Taken stands out as one of the best in mini series by this Director and also another mini-series was intense 'Dark Skies' this also was such a great mini series by Sony Pictures was a 5 star EXCELLENT mini series with so much in depth information regarding the famed MJ-12 and its secret dealings with UFO's it also appears to be more historically accurate as per my own research way before I saw this mini series. I have to say even the Fourth Kind was much more believable than Falling Skies.<br />Buyer beware, Falling Skies may have had many 5 Star reviews but if your looking for real historical accuracy and information on the UFO issue, then Taken, and Dark Skies 1996 mini series is your best bet. If you just want junk entertainment and pop corn shows, then Falling Skies is your best pic. I got my refund and will use it wisely, and Amazon please be aware of the labeling of these movies, I felt as though I was tricked into believing it was a 2 hour movie not a bunch of mini-series...Thank God for your customer service and professionalism in  understanding what I was trying to say over the phone, and the operator agreed the wording was off and needs to be corrected. Seek and you shall find the truth..Dark Skies is a nice place to begin with!.<br />MY RECANT......below!<br />I decided to give this series another peek, and although, it does start very slow in the first 3-5 episodes...as the each episode goes on it becomes a monster of a mini-series. Too many teary scenes, but in the light of so much intensity and the story line, they switch back and forth to high octane fighting with our Alien invaders, to love, family and unity. I completed the entire series in two full days, and I must tell you...in the second season, it was fantastic, well done, CGI was great, effects were awesome, Yet still in the last episode of season 2, it still does not say why they came, what they are after, its remains vague and confusing. But overall! I can't wait for season 3 and what they are cooking up their sleeves. In my own conspiracy theoretical mind, and with all the purported sightings, abductions, and encounters around the world and through out the ages...I can't help to feel these mini-series are a way to prepare ourselves for the -inevitable, and to desensitize our society in the strongest way, we are being visited, contacted, and have been for many hundreds and thousands of years. Although I stick to my guns..Taken was by far the best series from Mr. Spielberg, and Dark Skies- its more historically accurate.om Mr. Spielberg, and Dark Skies- its more historically accurate.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Bright, bold and wickedly fast.  If you blink too much you are toast!  Everything about this game is awesome.<br /><br />The graphics are great.  The arrangement and movements of the enemy ships are great. The music is fast and up-tempo like the game.<br /><br />The enemy is everywhere, their bombs are exploding everywhere, but it takes more than a few hits to kill you off.  And best of all your ship's maneuverability and firepower is just as good as the enemy's (love the power up laser beams).<br /><br />Kudos to the developers this is one remarkable game.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|If you like a page turner, hang on for the first few pages and if you are like me you, won't be able to put it down.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I ordered this case at the same time as I ordered my Kindle Fire. It's trim and handsome, just what I need.
B008PWUTJC|3.0|I don't know I am still on the fence about this one, I purchased this a few months ago, I find it, for me, a little too bulky on the heavy side, unlike the other product I'm about to review. Excellent craftsmanship, Quality is excellent. I still own it just don't use it as much as either the original leather cover for Kindle Paper White or the other cover I am about to review.
B0091REZMW|3.0|hard to load usually takes a few minutes. energy doesn't refill like it should. will stop playing if it requires me to spend money.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|the specifications listed are correct, it is a good product. I occasionally use it to charge a Galaxy S3. the only thing of the battery that  bothers me a little is the weight.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Had trouble with order, checked before I ordered it that the DVD would work here and was told it was and then it didn't work. Matter was resolved promptly but still a problem. Only ordered both together to sort out postage etc. Was willing to wait for it, bit disappointed it didnt work
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Get it, it was worth the read and the journey, Amazing story telling. Bottom line, great book! I am not a advent fan of fiction, although I may read some, and this was one I enjoyed.
B005SODYGA|5.0|if you love Rammstein, you need to get this album. it has a song from each year that defines their art. also has remixes that are cool to listen to
B004ELSDZK|5.0|They are so cute and serene just &quot;floating&quot; there watching you! (lol)  I got this yesterday as a free app and have enjoyed playing it for longer than I want to admit. The graphics are beautifully done, the music is very relaxing, and the game is challenging. Glad I got it.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|CD good but problems with other half of order. Nothing further to add to this bit, thanks.  See you later
B008AK8FHM|5.0|While I've believed for 40 years that there is a heaven and an afterlife, it's powerful for non-believers to have acknowledgement from a man of science.  it's touching and uplifting and I'm happy for Dr. Alexander that his soul was healed from his incredible experience.
B0009KA7BS|2.0|My son had recommended it...I was under the impression it was a true story...no way do I see it the way it was portrayed....didn't like it.....
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this app amazing and fun but can get pricey. Still a great way to waste time two thumbs up

B00BSBUZT6|4.0|The pacing and priorities of this documentary is a little puzzling.  While the beginning is suitably detailed in the evolution of the band and the first couple albums it starts to lose its way and becomes a discussion of the next quirk, torpedo, or implosion.  They burn up tape on how stoned everyone got at the \\"Eagles (Debut Album)\\" cover photo shoot and how much fun they had at the \\"Desperado\\" album cover photo shoot.  The account of the albums \\"On the Border\\" and \\"One of these Nights\\" is mostly only a background for the sacking of their first producer and Bernie Leadon.<br /><br />Astonishingly there is very little coverage of the creative process, only the creative differences.  Arguably their most impactful album, \\"Hotel California\\", is simply context for the final rift with Randy Meisner and the start of the exit of Don Felder.  Why and how most of the songs were chosen or even how the recording sessions were planned and executed are barely touched.  The larger pop mania of the album and its reach don't come up in any great way.  \\"The Long Run\\" album is simply described as an ugly recording session that took forever.  Again the genesis of the songs and the reasons for them are almost ignored in favor of a detailed account of how Glenn Frey and Don Felder almost came to blows on stage.<br /><br />Although every great band has its brain (Henley) and its fire (Frey) it seem the Eagles couldn't handle the same problems that plague all bands any better than anyone else.  Everything from creative input, money envy, performance anxiety, drug use, and even political friction might have been mediated with some negotiation and simple meaningless patronizing but they didn't choose to go that way.  Throughout Henley seemed aware of all the issues but above it all and Frey wanted only to butt heads.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to see what ended up on the cutting room floor and how it could have been more of an historical account of their first line of business, that of creating and playing music.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I liked this book very much.  It's well written around a simple plot with a great deal of detail and colmplex execution.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was sucked into the a world of what might be here on earth if we persist in our wasting, warring ways. The unlikely heroine is the catalyst for redemption.I enjoyed it very much.
B00BS4PF0C|3.0|why is this not the version that is played on the radio? this has curse words and I didn't realize that when I bought it for my kids.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|While it appears most people are receiving their CD as described, it seems that some of the Born to Die: Paradise Edition CDs are missing the songs \\"Without You,\\" \\"Lolita,\\" and \\"Lucky Ones.\\"  I ordered it anyway, hoping I'd get lucky and my copy would have those three songs on it.  Fortunately, it did!  In case anyone is curious, I ordered my copy on Amazon.com through Beaches Entertainment.  Perhaps if you order through Beaches Entertainment, you'll luck out and get the complete album as well.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I did not finish this movie. Very confusing, no story line, hard to follow. After reading reviews I hopped for more.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Everyone on this show keeps you on your toes and never fails to surprise with all of plots and twists.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is a great game for hand/eye coordination. And its fun. Keeps you moving and makes you watch what you are doing.
B00B935SUY|4.0|A vintage mixing board inspires Dave Grohl to dive into the history of Sound City studios. You should definitely go along with him on this journey.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This is such a great song and is definitely worth the download. Would recommend to a fried any day of the week.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|I was a huge fan if the books and si was concerned that the film wouldn't measure up to my expectations, but fortunately this movie succeeds on all levels. It truly did justice to one of my favorite novels.  The acting, the pacing, the look... It was all perfect.  The only thing I can say us the one that followed this was even better.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|Wow....what a pile of s***.    Extremely violent (could we turn up the volume on the punches some more?), flashy, cutting scene to scene. Maybe He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named thought that if he disoriented you enough with \\"lens flares\\" and explosions, you would miss the gaping black holes of inconsistency, plot lines and character development (or lack thereof).    I'm just glad I was able to see Leonard Nimoy. I wonder what he was thinking surrounded by these surfer dudes dressed in Star Trek uniforms. I don't even know where to start, but thankfully, others have pretty much nailed it down.    Speechless.
B008CX2A2I|1.0|Bought this BT dongle so I could stream music to my Onkyo reciever but it doesnt work from my Samsusn Galaxy S3.  I can pair my phone with it and it seems to connect ok (reciever even shows connected to my phone) but no sound comes out.  I've read about this (now) but the only solution Onkyo has provided that I've seen is \\"change the UBT-1\\"....very cryptic explanation.  WTH does that mean????
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I couldn't put it down just wish certain parts weren't so choppy felt like there where a lot of things skipped over but I loved the book none the less
B0020M99LC|5.0|Daniel Craig is terrific - lots of fast moving action & suspense.  Great cast.  Look forward to more Craig/Bond suprises.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Predictable but a nice light summer read. It is not her worst work the characters weren't as endearing as some of her others.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I just re- read this book and there's so much more to love the second time. The characters are richly written, the plot always interesting, and I'm left still wanting more. This was my favorite book in the series (so far).
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Another Daniel Craig/Bond success.  For some unexplained reason I watched this before Casino Royal.  You must watch them in order.  Saw &#34;Skyfall&#34; in the theatre - Craig/Bond gets better with every movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is probably my all-time favorite show, & I bought an extra set for the DVD player in the truck so I could be entertained on my lunch breaks. Then my aunt had to have surgery, & would be down for a while, so I gave her this copy- she'd never heard of Firefly, but loved my Firefly quotes t-shirt. So, I'll be ordering another copy soon. SHINY!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is addictive.  I had to buy Season 3 and can't wait for Season 4.  Now I know what all the buzz was about.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is probably one of the best apps if your always checking the weather. I live in Texas and the weather can change regularly. I use this app to stay up to the minute and it's right on point!
1439170916|5.0|Riveting,fascinating ,I could not put it down. As a cancer survivor it gave my disease, my treatment, and my survival new meaning. It is full of knowledge, compassion, and truth. It was truly inspirational -kudos and 5 stars to Dr Mulherkee !
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise is at the top of his game! This reminds me of his earlier work. I watched this movie twice it was so good!
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I bought this assuming it would charge my Kindle Fire from my computer.  But it doesn't.  It did connect it just fine though.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like the game and the suits and I love iron man the game is great also the graphics are good I just wish there would be a story mode instead of every time u die u go on the on the same course  but other than that it is awesome
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is a really really great game. I love it and play about everyday! Also, you level up super fast.
B00422LESO|5.0|I was worried about the ending, but it left me satisfied. A light-hearted read! Recommended for any Austen fans! (-:
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have never written a review before, and probably will never do it again. I've read a lot of book, as most everyone has, but this book was hysterical! I loved it! Started laughing from the beginning and never stopped.  I had to keep reading so I would know what happens. It was nice to read a book from a man's point of view. I hope this author keeps at it.  I would definitely recommend the book!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it gave me some ideas to think about on knowing what to say. I would of liked scenarios to give me a little more ideas, but still enjoyed reading it.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Really good book but ending was not developed enough...made me very curious about India and their culture...definitely worth reading.  Very good.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Don't expect any surprises here.  It's standard Tom Cruise fare, with him as the hero no one saw coming, the only guy who can right the terrible wrong, get rid of the bad guys, and sling one-liners across the room as he exits.  Everyone else serves as mere accessories; it's all about HIM.  It's not horrible, but don't say you weren't warned: these days, if you've seen one Tom Cruise movie, you've seen 'em all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My coworker told me about Jillian. She came to work sore, saying she could not complete a 20 minute workout without stopping in between, I was shocked. She suggested I purchase it because I was looking for something to help raise my heart rate, and BOY OH BOY, I found it. I now understand why she could not complete the dvd  without stopping in the beginning. This is the type of at home exercise I am looking for. I am definitely going to purchase more of her dvd's
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Loved Russell Crowe as a slimy politician!  Proves once again that he can do no wrong onscreen, as far as I'm concerned.  Mark Wahlberg gets better all the time.  They're pitted against each other in a compelling story with several other strong characters.  Worth watching.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Fun  to play with friends and compare dragons and worlds. a lot of waiting  is involved in the game and the first loading screen is very slow
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|The tool itself is easy to assemble and if you read the instructions is also easy to use.  I did not use the tapping tool that came along with the scorer. Instead I used hot and cold water. Here is a link to the video that helped me develop my method. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFXngPx3w3M<br /><br />After trying this method I found that it was easier to keep a pot of boiling water on the stove (keep the water at the same temperature). Dip the scored bottled into the boiling water for about 10 seconds (longer for thicker glass) and then at the sink run the bottle under a slight stream of cold water.  I found it was easiest to keep the water running during the process rather than turning it on and off.<br /><br />It's imporant that that the bottles are CLEAN and that you only score the circumference of your bottle only once - also very little presssure is required to create the score line, avoid putting all your muscle into it or the bottle will crack and break jagged.<br /><br />I used this to score over 140 wine bottles for wedding reception centerpieces, for the DIY Bride you cannot go wrong!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|This is a well written book with a plot that goes nowhere slowly. It almost doesn't make sense. And I am a big Richard Ford fan.
B00BS1VVIU|2.0|Only downloaded this song because I didn't know how your listen before buying option works. I have it figured out now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed playing. Can't wait for the next.The graphics are beautiful and the puzzles are just hard enough to make the game addictive.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|So far so good. Great graphics and loads of fun! It brings back some good gaming memories. Keep up the good work.
B008VBYN80|4.0|a real good game takes plenty of time so be ready to. sit down and enjoy the game a<br />I would give it 4 stars out of five
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game held my attention more than other games like this one I think the developer did an excellent job in making this game.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Quirky, fun, romantic, silly, beautiful, with a little bit of mystery, Audrey Tautou will make you believe in love. This film captures the flavor of Paris before the Euro. Also, you'll discover where the travel site, Travelocity, copied its traveling Gnome from. Amelie will capture your heart and make you want to call your favorite airline to book the next flight to Montmartre.
0062238868|5.0|If u have not served in the military but love our military this book is a must read, it is just simply great
1409136612|5.0|I loved every one of these great short stories by Maeve Binchy.  She can tell a tale like no other storyteller
B005IQZB14|3.0|The story line is interesting, but the writing style was mediocre.  And I thought the author took a long time to say the things she wanted to say.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am marathoning through The Hunger Games trilogy, reading the first two books in two days. I can't say enough for this series so far. I can't wait to finish it up with the last installment ASAP. So much action and suspense with plenty of cliff hangers that hook you in for the next chapter. Such a great ride
B005CVWWJY|5.0|A book based on a future online gaming world that is more important than the real world? Spice that up with a lot of 80's references and computer/video games ditos and you have a really worth reading book. The love saga is there as well together with the big and mean agitator. To summarize, if you love computer games, scifi in general or if you just looking for a book that tells a story about a not so distant future, this is the book for you.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought this for use during paranormal investigations. It can also be used for many other things, including a mic attachment for camcorders, recording live music, recording sound on pretty much anything. Recorder has a vast multitude of features and functions. It's a a top of the line recorder, with superior sound quality. The included software is packed with programs for many different uses. If you need a digital recorder, and aren't looking for a cheap, low sound quality model, this is the recorder you want.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I found it a little to fast moving for me. I'm a little slow caching on,otherwise I found it entertaining.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It's a game of mystery and fun.You get to solve mystery and invite your friends.General manager for your website is a millionaire
B00BLF9FOK|2.0|Knoxvillian is a term i just coined about five minutes ago . It's when Johnny Knoxville prevents your otherwise silly , fun and funny film from achieving even it's most modest of goals . In this case , to be adequate . It's a mixed bag . But , let's face it , It's a bag . Great to see arnie back . Super dumb fun with a swell but sometimes wasted cast . Worth a look . There again , Knoxvillian . Enough .
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Brandon Sanderson brought the many threads of the pattern (that Robert Jordan started) together in a literary tapestry that did not disappoint.  I didn't want to put it down.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Twisted might seem like an odd compliment, but if you are looking for a story that will take your imagination on a wild, twisted ride, then Shutter Island is for you.
B008XFJEE2|3.0|I thought it was ok.  It had some good parts but I didn't really care for the story line.  I didn't think there was much of a story.
B005LAII3U|2.0|I was really expecting a great adventure in this remake. After all, if my hero, that huge clumsy muttin mouthed oaf, Arnold Swartznegger, could act such a fun & fascinating story out of the original, combined with ALL the advances in Cinematography over the past 20+ years, I was anticipating a really great flick. What a bummer! They obviously spent a lot on this flop, but at the end of the day it all was squandered because the Casting Director was apparently Holistically Incompetent, the writers were tripping all over each other desperately trying to out do themselves & Common Sense, and then that perpetual disappointment Colin Farrell with his halfwit &#34;Wounded Puppy&#34; Demeanor & Fixed Facial Expression, simply couldn't measure-up to the task at hand no matter what the task.  No really, I haven't  ANYTHING  against Colin Ferrell, and if I never see another of his shows  I can probably keep saying that. The remake of Total Recall is deliberately confusing for no good reason, the cast was just awful, and quite honestly, I couldn't wait for it to be over.
B0047685I2|4.0|A very well told version of Cinderella.  One of my favorites. I watch this one over and over, and own it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awesome it is fun and I truly reccomend this to all people young and old you'll love it!!
B00AEFXOE0|5.0|I so enjoyed this movie that I bought it and then made my husband watch it with me.  I wish we had more coaches like this.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I like this application quite a bit.  If you want something that you can do minimal things to pictures, this is the app!
B00915G6WQ|3.0|The sound doesn't match up with the picture, so characters' lips start moving before you hear them speak. I can't believe there would be such an amateur mistake - surely the production team has someone responsible for making sure this doesn't happen?? And don't staff watch it before releasing it? Ridiculous!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I was confused through most of it and it didn't really come together for me.  I usually am the one that understands confusing movies and have to explain them to my husband, but this time I really didn't get it.  I think I need to read the book because books are almost always better than the movies.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This tool is amazing!  It's the ultimate in simplicity of design. Built by a young woman and her father as a project to help her with her math.
1565117808|5.0|there was only one scratched clip on one CD but all in all I very much enjoyed it - It was money well spent - I thank the seller !!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I had to get this book for school and I had been wanting to read it for a long time. It is a fabulous book, it exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this book to anyone. Can't wait to read the second book!
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I abandoned it half way through.  I found it to be sophomoric, poorly constructed, formulaic. The characters weren't compelling, and they did stupid things; they didn't communicate at all, much less have interesting, engaging conversations.<br /><br />I expected these books to at least be somewhat intelligent since I find the Bones TV series to be so.  I have no idea how the producers squeezed a fun, engaging show out of these empty books.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I enjoyed this album immensely, and still listen to a few choice songs on a daily basis. It's a strange album in that you pick out a few favorites the first time you listen to it, and then some of those favorites seem less good, and some of the other songs on the album that you didn't like so much the first time start to really stand out-- especially Within. Instant Crush is an Instant Classic. I genuinely enjoy to an extent that I really didn't expect 10/13 songs on the album, and so I have no problem recommending it. Be warned, however: if you come here seeking the usual repetitive Daft Punk, look elsewhere-- this is a new Daft Punk with an old sound, and I don't mean they sound like they used to as much as they capture the essence of the 70s and 80s in this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite games!!! I love the way it makes you think. Definitely worth the money. Makes you anxious for the next chapters.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|What is there to say about this book?<br />You could talk about the incredibly hilarious dialogue.<br />\\"Because apparently everything made her want to kiss him. Park could tell her that he had live and leprosy and parasitic worms living in his mouth, and Eleanor would still apply a fresh coat of Chapstick. God.\\"<br />You could mention the strong yet sweet storyline with the soul crushing but ultimately AMAZING plot twist at the end.<br />You talk about Eleanor and Park, the two awkward and sweet and lovable protagonists of the novel, whose story is lovely and... sweet. And heart wrenching and true and adorable and... this has become a run-on sentence.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book to you if you are seeking for a (devastatingly) quick read with characters that will reel you in from the first chapter. First sentence, even.<br />Rainbow Rowell has weaved an unforgettable tale of first love that will stay in my heart forever.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I often saw this book being read around campus at the time I decided to give it a try. I figured, I should see for myself if it's worthy of the hype. And now I can say, indeed it is.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the first John Green book I've read so I had no idea how he writes. The story was different for me than the other books I've read with the same underlying theme - inevitable death. First, I liked Hazel's pragmatic view of life. She didn't want cancer to be her life but rather just a side effect of living. She tried to live normally as possible even if she needed to carry a small oxygen tank around in a cart because her lungs weren't strong enough to breathe on their own. I liked that aspect of the book because it's not, as the characters would call those types of books, a \\"cancer book.\\" Secondly, I liked Augustus Waters a lot. He's one very likable character overall. He's light and witty - his personality fits very well with Hazel's. I enjoyed reading the book because their friendship just seemed so natural and it progressed beautifully for me. It's not so much as them trying to find consolation with each other because they're both cancer kids; it's them enjoying each other's company because they have the same perception of how they should live their life.<br /><br />The only factor that caused me to rate this book a 4 out of 5 was the rather unrealistic way in which Hazel and, most importantly, Augustus articulated their thoughs. No teenager talks that way! It's not like I didn't enjoy it - I did on some level. Because I have a soft spot for guys who can speak the way Gus did (dorks are the bomb). But at the back of my mind I always felt like all their dialogues, if set in a different scenario, would otherwise sound too unrealistic. I know it's a work of fiction but I also want a way for me to be able to connect to the characters all throughout.  I mean I loved the characters but at some point in the story, their dialogues were too much.<br /><br />Having said that, I'd still encourage you to read this book. John Green was able to draw my emotions in. Even if I didn't always enjoy the way the characters spoke, I still felt like their story's real.  The way they casually talked about death and afterlife with such acceptance and normality was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. I laughed with them. I cried with them. Overall, it's an experience that you just have to go for.Having said that, I'd still encourage you to read this book. John Green was able to draw my emotions in.

B0071BGOJC|5.0|Well written good historical value, Ken Follett at his best. I look forward to no 3. Must read for anybody.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|The first John Green book I read was The Fault in Our Stars, and I loved it. You can see now that I had high hopes for Katherines. Sadly, my expectations were not met.<br /><br />I think part of the problem is my lack of knowledge when it comes to John Green books. I never thought to do a bit of research on Goodreads first before deciding to try this one out. I just found the plot interesting so I went for it. I never figured that John Green had a knack for writing about quirky male leads who, to some extent, can actually be adorable. I didn't know what to expect. I only found out till later when I felt really frustrated about how disengaging Katherines is. I felt that on some level, even if quirky male leads is John Green's thing, I should've felt as hooked to the characters in this book like I was in TFiOS. Sadly, I wasn't. Maybe it just felt like the quirkiness of the whole book got too quirky.<br /><br />Let's talk about the characters first, since that's the biggest reason why I didn't like this book as much as I wanted/expected to. Colin could have been interesting, if he wasn't so bent on trying to perfect his theorem. He had so much potential to be this impossibly smart kid who's adorable that way but it didn't really manifest in the book. For me at least. Even when he was getting closer to Lindsey it didn't feel natural. It was sort of robotic. He may have been making progress with Lindsey, but inside he's still this quirky Colin who loves anagrams and is obsessed with being somebody. There was a major lack of character development. I just couldn't see what all those Katherines (and Lindsey) liked about him. Except for the flashback where Colin first kissed Katherine, when he said, \\"I'm a fairly good kisser.\\" That was the only time he seemed like a normal, likable human being. It's not so much as I dislike Colin, I just didn't feel any sort of connection with his character. And I always want to feel connected to the protagonist somehow.<br /><br />Then we have Lindsey who, right off the bat you'd know, is Colin's love interest. As far as love interests go, she also felt bland to me. You'd expect her to be this unbelievably lovable person but she truly wasn't. She's pleasant, but she's not extraordinary. In fact, K-19 (19th Katherine) felt more lovable to me. Along the way I sort of wished she'd call Colin and take him back but of course, she didn't (ohhh spoiler alert. *rolls eyes*). Lastly we have Hassan - your typical sidekick. Fat, awkward, and a minority. Don't get me wrong, most of the funny lines came from him (in my opinion, at least) but overall he didn't contribute much to the story except to elevate my annoyance at Colin. It's as if they're equally... unreal. I don't really know how else to describe them. All I know is I didn't feel connected to any of the characters.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on all the whining. You've been dumped by way too many Katherines. I get it! I was expecting some sort of glorious moment wherein he'd work his issues out but no, all I got was some mathematical equation (which works by the way - but I'll get to that) to explain his odd predicament with Katherines. I didn't even get a clear idea of why he was so addicted to the name Katherine.<br /><br />I didn't feel like the story had a climax. It was just one straight line with a few bumps along the way. But overall? It was like the story didn't take off. At one point I almost gave up but I just had to know how he'll come around and quit whining and how he'll end up with Lindsey. I didn't get much though. No spark, no this is it! moment, none.<br /><br />I rated this 3 out of 5 stars (meaning \\"it's okay\\") because of three reasons:<br />1. The occasional comedy, albeit a bit forced. I've learned from TFiOS that John Green has a way with (big) words so I wasn't surprised when I read a lot of those in this book. I have a thing for lines funny/witty lines phrased so differently.<br /><br />2. The original idea. I got so excited about reading this book because the idea's different and out there. I didn't really fulfill my expectations, but hey, I have to give him props for coming up with something so different than most YA contemporary books.<br /><br />3. The equation. Throughout the book Colin was trying to perfect his equation/theorem. At the end though - and this is a spoiler - there's bonus material wherein John Green's friend, who actually created the equation, explains how it works. I haven't really tried it myself but some people have  and they claim it works. Some say it doesn't though but they only get owned by people who tell them that they're using it wrong.ed about reading this book because the idea's different and out there.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|In Fifty Shades of Grey, EL James left us with Anna breaking up with Christian - thank goodness. Unfortunately, for a sequel to push through they have to get back together. And that's my main problem. How friggin' hard is it to decided whether or not a guy's worth your time? Sure, he's rich and hot but HE'S PSYCHOTIC. Really, Anna?<br /><br />Inside Anna's mind: Nevermind that he's a psychotic, sex-crazed, control freak. I love him. He's a broken little boy trapped inside this gorgeous body and I want to fix him.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on Christian's ex-sub haunting the story. It's like EL James was desperate to create conflict in the book that should've stopped with Fifty Shades of Grey, that she had to create an overblown problem about a crazy ex. I'm all for fantasy and all but this is too much. It's almost like a twisted fan fiction.... oh wait, it was!<br /><br />Now a lot of girls actually like how possessive and controlling Christian is, some girls actually think that's cute. But for me, it's plain creepy. How could you not feel a teeny tiny bit scared of him having \\"fifty shades\\"? I really, really don't get Anna.<br /><br />My usual rants about Fifty Shades of Grey were still present in the 2nd book: repetitive words that were inappropriately used, too much sex I could skip all of them and not miss a thing, and the sloppy writing. What's new. Yay.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll just say this straight on - I regret getting on the bandwagon. It was like I was blinded by the idea of a Christian Grey that I failed to see, at first, how incredibly ridiculous this book is. Now I'll be dissing the book in the form of a review (trust me I'll do my best to be constructive), so if you're a fan well... hello there.<br /><br />*Awkward silence*<br /><br />Okay let's get down to business.<br /><br />Reasons why I read the book in the first place:<br /><br />1. I was curious - my friends were raving about some Christian Grey.<br />2. I got on the bandwagon and fell asleep so I missed my stop and failed to get off on time (which then led me to reading the other two books but I'll discuss that in a separate post)<br /><br />But thankfully after some time I came to a realization that it's merely a hype and that a lot of people are blinded, sadly.<br /><br />Enough of that. Here's the \\"constructive\\" part of my review (I will try. Promise.):<br /><br />Reasons why I didn't like the book<br /><br />1. Plot<br /><br />Simply put, the plot lacked substance. Honestly if you take out all the erotica in it you could easily see how incredibly shallow the story is. Well... even if you don't, it's still shallow. You just have to get over how \\"hot\\" Christian Grey is to see how mindless it is. I feel like it only gained popularity because of how vulgar the sex scenes were. Sex sells, spot on.<br /><br />2. Characters<br /><br />There wasn't much variety in the characters. At some point I felt like everyone was all too perky and perfect (especially Christian's family) that it seemed like Kate, Anna's bestfriend, was the only believable character. More importantly, Christian's deep rooted psychological problem could have potentially contributed to his dynamic personality but in the end I just felt scared of him. A lot of the characters lacked grounding, I think.<br /><br />3. Writing<br /><br />One of my biggest issues with this book is the incredibly sloppy writing. I can't help but feel like the publisher was so in a hurry to ride the hype that it was enjoying in the world of fan fiction that they allowed the writing to suffer. A lot of big words were repeatedly used and sometimes it seemed out of place. Descriptions were lacking in important narrations and were in excess in a lot of unimportant narrations. I've never felt so annoyed at how scattered an author's writing could be. Ever.<br /><br />4. Fan Fiction<br /><br />Initially I had no idea it used to be a fan fiction of Twilight. A lot of the similarities in the book gave me the feeling it resembled Twilight and I was only able to confirm it when I did a bit of research via Google. When I found out though, it explained a lot - and I mean plenty. Now I know there's nothing new under the sun but to read something that greatly resembles another popular series? Turn off.<br /><br />5. Every Girls Dream (?)<br /><br />Am I the only one who feels like the story's filled with the author's secret desires? Nevermind that the idea's originally from Twilight. I'm just saying, everything's too good to be true. It's almost as if the writer put all of her frustrations into one book. Seattle's hottest, youngest billionaire bachelor falls madly in love with an ordinary college grad. Yup. Okay.<br /><br />That's about it. So much for immersing myself in all sorts of genre. Pleh.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a very interesting book with a lot of insight into the lives of slaves in Virginia during the 18th and 19th century.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This book is one of the cutest books I've ever read. And I'm not using the word \\"cute\\" because it's a good story but not good enough to get a 5-star review. Because IT IS! It's one of those books that are easy to read because the characters (not just the main characters) contribute to the enjoyable reading experience and the overall flow of the story is great.<br /><br />Anna is a very relatable character so it was easy to fall in love with her and to feel for her throughout the book. I love that she's a simple girl who's a bit of a nerd. She loves watching films (and she calls them \\"films\\" not \\"movies\\") and keeping things in order. She was annoying at some parts but the writing's so good, I didn't mind much. She's an overall likable character who's different from most female protagonists we read about in YA books.<br /><br />On the one hand we have Etienne St. Clair who's just as easy to fall in love with. I fell in love with this character primarily because he's British and I'm not immune to British boys. A British boy... fluent in French. Damn. He's probably one of the most adorable male leads I've read about ever. He's sexy without being the hot guy in school. Even the name is sexy. (I could just keep going on and on about how Etienne is now my favorite male YA character ever *swoon*)<br /><br />Honestly I just wanted to describe Etienne in length (because I'm an obsessive freak like that) but then it's ANNA and the French Kiss so I have to stop myself.<br /><br />What exactly made me love this book? It gave me a hangover. Anna and Etienne's relationship progressed so naturally - and that's what I always look for in YA love stories. I often read about stories where the leads would suddenly fall in like/love with each other and I don't really like that, because I feel like I'm being hurried into liking a book. But this one took me along for the ride - and that's exactly how I became attached. I sympathized with the characters when all the drama happened, and I felt happy for everyone when the conflict was resolved. More importantly, Perkins showed a glimpse of Anna and Etienne's relationship after they kissed and made up. I appreciate that part the most because it sort of frustrates me when authors end love stories with the big kissing scene and then I'm left with nothing to obsess about. I actually want to feel hung up on a book - in a good way of course.<br /><br />I highly recommend Anna and the French Kiss. It's the kind of book that's so engaging that it will keep you reading continuously and will make you sad for finishing it so fast.<br /><br />Come to think of it... I might read it again sometime. I seriously miss Etienne. Tee hee.lt happy for everyone when the conflict was resolved. More importantly, Perkins showed a glimpse of Anna and Etienne's relationship after they kissed and made up.

B00846REIS|4.0|After the whole Fifty Shades of Grey fiasco I became wary of books being associated with it (like this one). But when I saw that the Crossfire series is being optioned for a TV series and is in the early stages of development, I got curious enough to want to try it out. Plus, one of my blogger friends encouraged me. (Thanks, Louisse!) Three days after, here I am.... trying to write a review. Bear in mind that I started this novel with Fifty Shades of Grey (minus the BDSM) in mind so this review might contain a few comparisons. (Sad, I know. I apologize.)<br /><br />I have a love-hate relationship with this book. For starters, there were a lot of similarities between Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You. Christian Grey and Gideon Cross were too alike that it bothered me at times; it gave me a slight feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Now I won't dive too much into details because I plan on creating a separate post on it. But I will say this: the similarities were a total bust for me.<br /><br />Then we have Eva. Eva was nothing like Anastasia Steele of Fifty Shades of Grey... sort of. Alright fine, the biggest difference between the two ladies is the fact that Eva wasn't an innocent little virgin - which was great. That meant Eva wasn't naive about a lot of things like Ana. However they were similar in something - they were both moody. No, I don't think moody's the right word but that'll have to do for now. Eva had a lot of I love you/I hate you moments that it became tiresome for me at some point. I get that you're broken and that you've never felt this connection with someone before but make up your mind.  Don't just go back and forth, being all tough one moment then feeling all weak the moment he touches you. Grow a pair!<br /><br />Which now brings me to my major irritation: makeup sex. It's like Gideon's sole response to Eva's constant nagging whenever she'd demand for the truth or for Gideon to open up is sex. The sex put Eva in a happy mood... but does it ever fix the problem? Nope. Is the problem still there after? Yes. Will they argue about it again? Yes. Will they talk it through this time? Nope. It's a vicious cycle! Opening up is something that Gideon's not very comfortable with but at least have the spine to tell him no. The hot attraction was undeniable but you have to know when to keep it at bay.<br /><br />Okay I'm done with my complaints. On to the reasons why I did like it. Off the top of my head: Gideon Cross. While I didn't necessarily like his similarities with Grey, he had some qualities that made me like him more. He was more direct in... err propositioning Eva, which was totally refreshing. No bullcrap or formalities. That's probably the thing I liked most about him. I also liked the chemistry between him and Eva. They were so good together when they weren't so caught up with their issues and drama.<br /><br />I enjoyed Eva's friendship with Cary too. It was refreshing to see a best guy friend who's actually bisexual and didn't completely pose a threat. Cary's just as messed up as Eva and Gideon. He had his own issues to deal with and that usually involved Eva in the process because they were each other's support system. I wish to see more of Cary in the second book and how his character develops.<br /><br />Next is the plot. While there were a lot of mysteries left unsolved and questions unanswered at the end of the book, I did like that there was a plot - a sensible one at that. Last is the fact that while it might have been insta love, the way Day wrote it made it bearable. The writing's definitely a plus for me. Day's vivid descriptions were just right; not the sloppy, cliched writing that I was half-expecting (sorry).<br /><br />Overall, I liked it because it exceeded my expectations.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|So now we have the mentally disturbed couple happily married and rich. A few things I'd like to rant about:<br /><br />1) Christian and Anna's petty fights. The one I can remember is the one where Anna goes topless during their honeymoon to piss off Christian and then she falls asleep. Christian finds out and to punish her, he puts hickies all over Anna's chest area so she won't be able to expose herself again. Am I the only who thinks this is just a waste of few pages?<br /><br />2) Christian's helpers. We all know he has a loyal assistant/bodyguard Taylor who basically would do anything for him. That's okay. I can forego his exaggerated loyalty. But now we find out that his house help, Mrs. Jones, cleans some of the objects inside the \\"playroom.\\" HOLD IT. You mean to tell me that this house help, who does the laundry, cooks food, and basically tidies the house also takes care of Christian's toys? You have got to be kidding me. It's absurd how Christian's little helpers are all too comfortable and fine with how he does his business. I mean really.... really.<br /><br />3) Anna saves the day. I can't even find the words to describe how stupid I think this part of the story is. Anna being heroic and following the kidnapper's instructions so she can protect Christian's family. *slow clap* I have to give her props though for rising to the occasion unlike Bella Swan (who's basically her PG-13 self in another dimension). But come on! You. Are. So. Freaking. Stupid. I don't even want to dwell on this anymore, I might just end up repeating myself.<br /><br />Probably the only thing that I liked in this book is Anna telling Christian that she's pregnant. Because Christian freaked out and stormed off. Hahahahahaha. No seriously though, it was only logical when Christian admitted that he finally understood that what he did with Mrs. Robinson was wrong because he imagined how it would be like if his son would do it. Bravo! Finally, douche bag.<br /><br />To end this terrible review/rant, I would just like to say: fan fictions are incredibly perverted. The end.<br /><br />Seriously though, I can't believe this series surpassed Harry Potter book 7's sales. I am mortified. And saddened at how people's taste level is significantly going down nowadays. Ladies! I know they say people should read more, but we meant everyone should read more books with substance. Learn to filter what you read and quit raving about this trilogy. If you thought this series is worth 3-5 stars, you obviously need to read more.

B000244FDW|4.0|Perhaps I prefer my Jane Austen Hollywooded Up a bit but I just loved the newer Keira Knightly version.  The best Mr. Darcy on record. He brought real passion to the role with just a glance.  Now, to this movie, the BBC mini series, I have no idea when I bought it but a few days ago I saw it there on the shelf so I started looking at it.  Both the women leads are extremely good and very attractive. I did have a little trouble at first determining which was Lizzie and which was Jane as they look very much alike.  If you look at the Colin Firth version, neither of the lead women are very attractive and Jane is actually plain with a huge neck. In this version, David Rintoul as Darcy is definitely a one note actor and you actually don't feel any of his supposed passion for Elizabeth. He is the most wooden actor I've ever seen in any role.  Nor does the actor in the role of Bingley seem all that much enthralled with Jane. I do wish there was some way to let the audience know what a really silly and stupid woman Mrs. Bennet is without having her in so many scenes. In every version I've ever seen I just want to slap her silly and often fast forward through many of her scenes. The most odious performance of this role is in the Colin Firth version. They reeeeely overdid it on that one.  The reading of the Mrs. Bennet role in this BBC mini series is made more annoying by the fact that they stick her in almost every scene during the first part of the movie and one always wonders why her husband hasn't killed her years ago. The most sympathetic reading of the role is in the Keira Knightly version but she still grates on the nerves. As in many BBC movies, this version tends to drag a bit and include many scenes that could have been omitted without hurting the production at all. I like this BBC version better than the Colin Firth version but, as I said, the far superior film is the Keira Knightly movie. She really captures Lizzie and though they have taken some liberties with thestory it just makes it better.  To be honest, I find Jane Austen's books to be wordy to the point of boring and everybody just talks, talks, talks to the point where one wants to just scream \\"for the love of pete, get on with it\\". Great stories though.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|Fun facts before you read my review:<br /><br />1) I didn't know it had a large readership.<br />2) I actually bought a hardbound copy of this book.<br />3) It took me three tries in a span of 13 months before I actually finished it.<br /><br />I actually like the idea Lauren Oliver had for Delirium: Love's a disease and there's a cure for it. Not to sound emo but I think it's a great concept. However I think Oliver had trouble with the execution. It took me three weeks to finish the book the third time I read it because the first part of the book was a bit dragging. It only got interesting for me halfway through the book, and it still wasn't engaging enough for me to finish it faster.<br /><br />The Setting<br /><br />Personally I think dystopia-themed novels, such as The Hunger Games and 1984, are always interesting to read. Unfortunately Delirium fell short in terms of creating a solid picture of the world the protagonist, Lena, lives in. Don't get me wrong, I get the general idea: love's a curable disease, the city's closed off, you get evaluated and paired off to a suitable partner in order to promote balance in society yada yada yada. Problem was, Oliver failed to make a big deal out of the twisted system the US was operating; there wasn't a higher sense of urgency. And because of that the setting became too soft for me. Almost like I didn't feel that the problem needed to be solved anyway, like the system's working and Lena's just being irrational.<br /><br />Another reason why the setup didn't do it for me was the lack of a concrete antagonist. In my opinion, there always has to be an antagonist very much present in dystopian literature. In Delirium, it's clear that the government is behind it all however there's no one person embodying the system.<br /><br />The Characters<br /><br />The Lena and Hana friendship is a bit clich&eacute; for me. The way they're different, Hana being the perfect one and Lena being the plain one, has been used too much in YA novels. I get that Lena had to be portrayed as ordinary so falling in love will create an impact on her self-esteem but using the clich&eacute; friendship to establish that didn't really click for me. Also I can't quite understand what made Alex fall in love with Lena. I know some love stories are purposefully written that way but I'm the type of reader who wants and has to see what made A fall in love with B.<br /><br />Individually though I appreciate the balance of characters in the book - nobody was too good to be true. I like that Lena was believably ordinary. I like that Carol's neither overbearing nor lax to the point of being irrelevant. I like how cool Alex is but not too cool as if he's the author's real life frustration. I like Hana's enthusiasm in trying out \\"illegal\\" things like listening to unapproved music or going to secret raves. Although come to think of it, Hana behaves like she's infected but it's clear that she doesn't have a love interest..... or does she. Heh.<br /><br />Individually, characters are okay. But overall? I didn't connect with them.<br /><br />The Conflict<br /><br />Now I get why the biggest (the way I saw it) conflict was placed towards the end of the book - in preparation for Pandemonium (the sequel). However in dystopian novels I feel that the main conflict should be the dystopia itself which, like I said, wasn't made into such a big deal. To me, the story lacked grounding because of this hence the conflict didn't add much to my enjoyment. Conflicts suck, essentially, but they have to be there in order for the reader to really get into the story.<br /><br />The Writing<br /><br />I always criticize a writer's style/technique because it's one of the biggest things I easily notice whether it's good or bad. I didn't like the way Delirium was written. Some parts were too dragging because of the long (descriptive) paragraphs that weren't even that helpful to the story. And I don't know if it's just my lack of imagination or the descriptions weren't that good but some parts of the town and of the Wilds were hard to picture.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />In conclusion, I thought Delirium was okay. It didn't give me the hangover effect but it has merits. I love how it ended though (and I'm not about to spoil it for everyone) so I'm not sure if I'll read the 2nd book, Pandemonium. It might ruin the series or book for me.'t that good but some parts of the town and of the Wilds were hard to picture.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />In conclusion, I thought Delirium was okay.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game to play with the kids. My son and i play it on different devices one on kindle and ipod touch.
B003I55BIA|5.0|How do I even begin to explain how I feel about Perfect Chemistry? To be honest, I felt a bit turned off when I read the first two chapters of the book. It began with Brittany's point of view in the first chapter, then Alex's point of view in the next. Simone Elkeles showed a glimpse of Brit's and Alex's lives before they even met - their families, friends, school life. From the get go, I could easily predict how the story would unravel. To me it was all a bit too clich&eacute;; popular rich blonde who-you-think-is-perfect-but-isn't falls in love with the Spanish bad ass from \\"da hood\\". And to top it off, there's the element of the bet made between Alex and his friends, the bet that says he has to get Brittany to sleep with him before Thanksgiving. The moment I read about it in the synopsis I just thought, \\"Oh I can already see how this will end.\\"<br /><br />True enough, I was right. The storyline is so formulaic I thought twice about finishing it at first. BUT I'M GLAD I DID! The story may have been predictable early on but Simone Elkeles wrote with such creativity that I was able to look past all the clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Brittany's and Alex's secret lives are so non-conventional that you'd sympathize with the characters as you go along the way. It didn't make me want to bang my head on the book and yell at them saying, \\"Dude, it's so simple! How can you not see it?!\\" (unlike some wildly predictable stories)<br /><br />What exactly is non-conventional about their secret lives? Although Brittany is Little Ms. Perfect in school, the truth is she's anything but at home. She has a mother who constantly nags on her, her father is too workaholic they can barely talk to him, and her older sister whom she loves dearly, Shelly, has cerebral palsy. (And she's pretty much the biggest part of who Brittany is) On the one hand we have Alex, a member of the notorious gang called the Latino Blood. After witnessing his father get killed when he was only 6 years old, he had to grow up to early to protect his mom and two brothers. (But there's so much more to Alex's history, I just don't want to spoil everything for everyone)<br /><br />The way Elkeles brought her lead characters to life with their rich backgrounds appealed to me and made me forget about how predictable the storyline is as a whole. But Elkeles was able to polish the details of the book without going overboard and turning it into a crazy whirlwind love affair. (*coughs* Beautiful Disaster *coughs*)<br /><br />The part that made me totally ignore all the clich&eacute;s I've been blabbing about from the beginning: how Brittany found out about the bet. Now we all know the usual way is she'll find out about it from someone else and when she confronts the guy he'll be all, I'm sorry! At first it was just about the bet but then I fell in love with you yada yada yada. Then they'll break up. But in Perfect Chemistry, Alex told her the whole truth himself, and even had his friends confirm it to her. I spoiled it for everyone since we all know she's bound to find out anyway.<br /><br />And this is me nitpicking: I found that the book lacked vivid physical descriptions of the characters. I had trouble picturing a hot gangster Latino and a beautiful blonde who doesn't look pasty. Or maybe it's just my inability to appreciate blondes and the stereotypical gangster Latinos I'm used to. Or maybe it's the people on the book cover that messed with my imagination. Maybe. Definitely the people on the cover. Side note: DON'T PICK BOOKS WITH PEOPLE ON THE COVER. Kidding.<br /><br />The winning factor for me is how Elkeles was able to provide an image of how Brittany and Alex's relationship continued by writing about it briefly in the end, and in the epilogue. I easily get disappointed whenever a writer would make characters discuss a future together only to leave her audience hanging. It's just this pathetic thing I go through whenever I finish reading a love story - I need to know what else happened to them after the The End in the last chapter. Some sort of follow through is necessary, and Simone Elkeles delivered excellently.<br /><br />TO SUM UP:<br />1. The book may be filled with clich&eacute; but the details will make you fall in love with the story and the characters (including the minor ones).<br />2. She's a good enough writer, technique-wise.<br />3. It lacks vivid physical descriptions but I guess that's just me.<br />4. You will definitely love the follow through in the end. *wink*ter the The End in the last chapter.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I had been using an ancient Belkin Nostromo, but it was starting to wear out from years of use. I purchased the Logitech G13 as a replacement, and am very pleased with it.<br /><br />It is so much easier to program than the Nostromo was, and the different profiles load automatically for each game. I have smaller hands, so every game pad I've tried has given me difficulty when trying to reach the peripheral keys. Sadly, this one does as well. I don't even bother programming the outer keys on the top row.<br /><br />The thumb joystick is easy enough to get used to within a few minutes, though I have to release it completely to tap the buttons below and to the left of it, so neither can function for me as a \\"jump\\" button.<br /><br />The center keys have a distinctive concave curve to them, so it easy for my fingers to find \\"home\\" again without having to look.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems with the quality of the hardware, and the software was a snap to install.
B000N5F6PG|5.0|love this movie and it one of the best glad i found it i love Amazon for this reason to find this with great prices, love it
B00659N39K|5.0|I ordered this because I 1) love Totoro, and 2) wanted to have better portion control at lunch. The containers are very well made, they don't leak, and the design has not worn away after a month of washing. Because I want to keep these looking cute for a very long time I have only hand washed them, so can't say if the design would stay in place if they were placed in the dishwasher.<br /><br />The size is small, but it holds enough so that I feel like I had a full lunch. I will typically reheat and then put some of the previous night's leftovers in the thermos. I can't say that it's still warm by the time I get to take a lunch break, but it's still good. The other two containers I use to put in a small salad, a handful of nuts, and a little container of dressing.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|The CD has a lot of the songs that Rena and Juliet sing in the TV show. Performed by them. Avery, Deacon, and Scarlet also have some songs on the disc, performed by the TV show actors, and sounds great. If you like the show then you will love the disc. Highly recommend it.

0061122416|5.0|The storyline just keeps pulling you and pulling you in.  I loved the hand off to different characters and each taught a lesson and reflected facets of myself and others that you see every day.  The mysticism isn't smarmy sweetness, it's real and centered on what needs to be within each of us to be heros.  READ THIS you will get something deep and profound and unforgettable out of it.
B00AFZ86BA|2.0|This compilation is missing the Ratt EP! Why would they leave that out? It's a great album and very, very expensive to buy, on CD, as it's long out of print...Disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I hadn't heard of these books until the movie had come out. I watched the movie then just had to get the book. I know the books are almost always better than the movie made from them. Knowing that I just had to read it. And I was right it was better now I'll have to read the others before they are made into movies.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is well written, produced, and filmed. I am somewhat particular on editing, etc., and this show is pretty well edited. Good character selection for the parts actors and actresses play, as well. I have been largely hooked on this show since the first episode. The cases are fresh and the theme is lively and exciting--especially in the first season. I would absolutely recommend this show if you're looking for a fresh storyline and a strong female lead.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Honestly, I came with low expectations, but the action scenes were much better than most.  The script was tight, if a little cheesy at times.<br /><br />Overall, much better than I expected.<br /><br />Give it to Cruise, for all his faults, his movies are usually entertaining.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|It is good if you want to kill time but other then that my sister plays it more then me.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Needless to say, the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis was incredible.  You really believe he is Lincoln.  Other major roles are also incredibly well performed and the costumes and sets are phenomenal.  The movie does a great job of putting you into the 19th century Civil War era.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that, not having read the book or knowing very much about Lincoln, parts of the story are not readily understood.  But, it has made me want to read &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; by Doris Kearns Goodwin and to learn more.
B0089PJFFY|5.0|I enjoy reading this book, it's a great part of history... I highly recommend it to anyone h<br />Who's interested in leaning about the past.

034580404X|4.0|I have heard a lot of people talking about the \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\" so I decided that it was time for me to see what it all about. The story is about shy student Anastasia Steele meeting a self-made entrepreneur Christian Grey. A meeting that will change forever change their lives.<br />The series starts out in Fifty Shades of Grey. A book and series that you know has many steamy love scenes. I will say that the first book is a bit slow and maybe that is why some other reviews are not that good. But if you make it past book one and into \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" you will be rewarded. The series becomes so much more that the steamy sex scenes and you get heart of the love story between Ana and Christian. The reader learns the root of what made Christian the man that he is and how his love for Ana changes him for the better.<br />Over the \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\" was time spent and a series that I really enjoyed
B005G8AFFG|5.0|Love this CD. Just Amazing. Just close your eyes and take it in. Highly recommended to any fan of the blues. Just recently discovered her and I now have 4 of her cds. Can't get enough.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Maiden's own Film Producer and Director Andy Matthews went back to the 1988 edit and painstakingly remastered each shot digitally; color correcting and grading to give the image the best possible look from that time.<br /><br />Is this process very hard as pertains to new modern technology being used on old film in being that the Film Producer remastered each shot digitally, I think the same thing needs to be done with that Steve Harris shot Rock In Rio Show because there are way too many camera changes. If that is at all possible it needs to be done and re-issued?

B00021R7CG|4.0|Although the plot was great, the story line wandered some during the movie.  In the end, you wondered where Powers Boothe and Rebecca DeMornay were headed, and if they were going to make it.  Darrin McGavin was great as a ditzy, hawkish, temporary President and Rip Torn was terrific as the whack-job Colonel who advised him.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My only complaint, and it isn't anything Amazon can take care of, is understanding some of the English accents.  Maybe I'll watch it again to see if I can pick it up better!
B007EDYN36|4.0|I'm a big KISS fan so I was eager to crack open Peter's autobiography and learn about his wild adventures over the past 40+ years in the music business.<br /><br />The autobiography started off with Peter Criss holding a gun in his mouth, ready to commit suicide. It was reminiscent of Hulk Hogan's recent memoir, My Life Outside the Ring. Needless to say, this got my attention and the rest of the book held it up until the chapter about Peter's religious beliefs, which I skimmed. It was fascinating reading about his career prior to KISS, how he joined the band and his opinion on the others members as the years progressed. Of course, this was a one-sided story, which I kept in mind while reading it.<br /><br />The other members of KISS have accused Peter of being a whiner and out of control. This comes through in his autobiography. He did a massive amount of drugs, wasted a ton of money and didn't do a great job of controlling his temper. Reading these stories made me feel bad for the guy. Thankfully, Peter saw the error of his ways and got his act together during KISS' reunion tour. Unfortunately, all the bad blood he created during the band's heyday caused Paul and Gene to never trust him again. Peter's stories about this time period were especially interesting since this is when I became a fan of the band.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great read for fans of KISS and/or classic rock autobiographies. It's filled with humorous and heartbreaking stories that kept my rapt attention; and it gave me a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like to part of, what I consider to be, the greatest American rock band of all time. I recommend you check it out.

B004478AS4|5.0|75% of the book deal with life before colonization and giving a sympathetic portrayal of African life pre-colonization. 25% deals with life during active colonizations.<br /><br />What does this book teach us that we didn't know before?<br /><br />1. Missionaries were actually the first people in Africa. It's not like the colonial powers sent the first governor general to the first place and that was it.<br />2. It also appears that missionaries were the vehicle for teaching people how to read and write.<br />3. If Achebe's account is to be believed, the missionaries bowled over the local people by: a. Doing things that should have (according to the local population) brought certain death (to the missionaries), but didn't; b. By bringing medicine and goods as a testament to the superiority of the foreign gods.<br />4. It seems that the Africans (of that part of the world) did have something like their own justice systems and markets. And they looked a lot like our justice systems looked in the past. (Religious leaders were also political leaders or the role of the clergy and the role of the judge was mixed up.)  And our market look today.<br />5. The ratio of colonial administrators to Africans was 1:100 and a lot of Africans had a hand in the subjugation of the continent for their own benefit.<br /><br />The book did go over some things that we did already know.<br /><br />1. Every family has problems. (Lazy fathers. Abusive husbands. Strained parent-child relationships.) It's the same all over the world.<br />2. The Africans of that age were not of a high level of technological development. And some of their rituals/ beliefs were outright barbaric. (Murdering of twin infants. Drinking wine from the skull of vanquished enemies. Mutilation of childrens' corpses.)<br />3. There was no written language prior to colonization.<br />4. The church took most of its early adherents from the disaffected/ disenfranchised. The slime of frustrated souls was the mortar of the building blocks of a new order.<br /><br />There were some things that were not answered.<br /><br />1. With so many men having two and three wives, what happened to all the men who could never find a woman?<br />2. Where did the high priestess take the protagonists sickly daughter?<br /><br />Ultimately, Achebe wanted us to see a society falling apart. But the thing is: When a society that is less advanced comes into contact with one that is more advanced, the only result is that they either learn or become exterminated. And this has happened many times on the earth. If this topic took a whole book to address, I'm glad that it only took 209 pages.<br /><br />The book itself is written in many bite sized chapters and can be read in a single day. It is the ease of reading and the simplicity of prose that makes the whole book worth it. Unlike some authors that drag on for thousands of pages (Bill Clinton. Ayn Rand. Joseph Conrad.), Achebe gets in, says what he has to say, and then wraps up. Cliff's notes will need to be read with this book because there are so many rituals that we just can't figure out and will need explained to us.<br /><br />Verdict: Worth the time, worth the money. Recommended.ilding blocks of a new order.<br /><br />There were some things that were not answered.<br /><br />1.

Raw & Garage sounding at its dirty best (all the talk of \\"sound quality\\" not withstanding), this album (& its predecessor) shows us all how great songs shine, no matter how much the polish is lacking.

B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I really liked this movies sort of some suspence and magic and romance together. Didn't read the book but this movie inspired me to read it
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|There were a lot of interesting concepts throughout, but all the  &#34;blood and guts&#34; took over the whole movie!!!<br /> Really?..... Why do they have to  show all the &#34;gore&#34; in order to tell the story?!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|If your just starting the show you really need to go back to the the very first episode. You won't understand the series really.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|While i wanted to strangle the man that thought he could have it all and not actually feel, this makes for a really good read. Comedy, lust, romance, and that lovely blackout-returning-memories, it has it all.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Played this game after Virtue's Last Reward, so was unfortunately already spoiled for a big part of the story. Nevertheless it was a fantastic game. Puzzles are great, story is original and sucks you right in. Only thing I missed was a feature its sequel does have which is the ability to keep track of different storylines you've already progressed through. But still, together with Virtue's Last Reward, one of the best stories in a series I've ever played, and I've been gaming for almost 25 years. Can't wait for the third installment.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|This was my first movie purchase on my Kindle Fire HD - great movie for 1st purchase.  Love the actors and production. Also bought the book. There are differences so you need to buy both!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's fun until you run out of jewels then you have to pay<br />I hate games that buckle and dime you
B008MM9630|5.0|It is so great!  I recommend it to people of all ages.  I think that the waiting times are reasonable and you get crystals often.
1451626657|5.0|Gave this book to my grandson who is currently serving time in prison.  Heard from him regarding the books, they are helping him a lot.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I was hoping that I would be able to use this with my Kindle Fire, but I was unable to.  The instructions are not very clear about which HP printers you can use, but after about an hour of checking out the HP website I found that you cannot use a printer that is connected to your computer through a USB port.  So disappointed.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The book  was long and not very exciting. the first two books of The Clifton Chroncicles was a lot more interesting.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|Loved it there is not a book of his that I don't like<br />Always look forward to his new works
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I will but again....This is one of the most sought after DVD's.....I can now watvh it over and aver again..thanks
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book of The Clifton Chronicles!  The next book can't come out soon enough, seriously!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have heard slot about this book, but I must say it was much better than I thought it was going to be.  It kept me intrigued and was very hard to put down.  I think that Christian is very women's dream MAN. In more ways than one.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Maybe it's because this is the first book I read and enjoy but this is one of the best book ever written.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful game for horse lover's or someone with a place I their heart for animals! Its plan out fun I think everyone should give it a try!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|2012PG13: Finally, a Tom Cruise movie that makes you think without all the explosions and CG. Not that I don't really dig MI and Oblivion, but it's just cool to be able to see him play a smart guy in addition to being dangerous. It's good to have a gun, but better to have a gun & brains. MFJLabs 3.5x
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love that the puzzles get harder.  I have my whole family playing the games.  It feels like brain excersize.
B000GOWNPU|4.0|1996R: this flick is freezing. Normally I don't go for sadistic pedifile freak films, but Barry Levinson did an excellent job of presenting horrible subject matter while telling a compelling tale of treachery, revenge, and true friendship. At first viewing you may feel a little unfulfilled by the conclusion, but just think ... a little imagination can tell you exactly what happens to pedifile freaks in jail, so ... no need to see it on screen. MFJLabs 4x
B004ELSDZK|3.0|Wasn't that impressed. The story is weird. The only puzzle to this game is figuring out how to remove all the pieces off the board. It is a fairy easy game. This is not a game my kids would play.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Quite fun and certainly the most unusual book I have read (apart from Life of Pi) but a bit too long which means that my interest was certainly waning by the end!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved every minute of every episode.  The attention to detail is remarkable.  I got swept up into the time period and tried to imagine my grandparents in that sort of atmosphere and time period.
B002EC3932|4.0|I like Iyer's style and creativity. I find this album more enjoyable than his quartet recordings as it puts him more front and center.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|i get to see and talk to my family and friends the contents are great and your also reminded of loved ones birthdays!
006224454X|5.0|I loved this book and found it impossible to put down.  Thought I had figured out what really happened and was completely surprised.  Excellent debut novel and I certainly will read the next one this author writes.  A thrilling page turner.  Love it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was good however i had problems staying interested so it took me awhile to finish it. Good series.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Like this application 50/50. Very touchy and unable to play games. I wouldn't spend money to use this application. Good if you just want to read other people's posts or see photos.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|If you appreciate &#34;The Grudge&#34;. &#34;The Eye&#34;, &#34;The Others&#34; or &#34;Skeleton Key&#34;, I think you'll like this refreshing modern ghostly plot. Very well filmed. Great ghostly special effects too.
B005IQZB14|5.0|She felt she was damaged, faltering and lost, grasping at other's feelings and desires, hateful of what she didn't have, until she decided to hike and bravely complete the PCT, alone!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If there is one thing that represents a zombie apocalypse accurately it is this. The wide variety of issues social,economic, and military. This encompasses the world of the undead like nothing I have ever seen or read.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|With it's revolutionary electronic sound track and dated SP/FX, combined with a healthy portion of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer, this movie can still be enjoyed for its quaint eeriness. Robbie the Robot still steals the show.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is very entertaining. I truly hope I can find some more games like this.<br />I am hooked on this type of games.
0375869026|3.0|As a big fan of YA literature, I found this book disappointing. While it had some poignant moments, I felt the author was ultimately beating you over the head with certain morals and messages (siblings suffer too, etc). I also did not find the ending realistic. It would be nice to think that the main character, August, would be accepted despite his severe deformity and make friends and be embraced by the school. While acceptance is a good message to send the age group reading this, I don't feel this was realistic in the cruel world we live in. I am a middle school teacher. Kids are very cruel. Even the kind ones would not take the risks some of these characters did with August out of fear of the bullies and cruel kids. There is a female character who befriends August despite the treatment he is receiving and starts sitting with him at lunch. Again, a great message to send...but would this happen? No way a middle school child, even a kind one, would take this kind of risk. In a perfect world maybe.<br /><br />Ultimately I do think this is a good book for middle school students to try and teach acceptance and tolerance. But judging it as a book I chose for myself, it ultimately disappointed me because it was unrealistic. I much preferred The Fault in Our Stars by John Green.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|\\"Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock is one example of an potential Oscar-nominated film that really should have got more attention than how the critics provided a mixed reaction to it. The film, as a whole, focuses on Alfred Hitchcock and his often unheard-of wife Alma, working on the kerfuffle that was the 1960 classic Psycho.<br /><br />Much in the vein and constraints of a TV drama, the film is surprisingly effective as a film being extremely yet darkly hilarious and convincing with Anthony Hopkins' excellent (yet facially uneven resemblance) take on Hitchcock's witty, sardonic banter. A fine piece of filmmaking his work is and this underrated biopic that is which, in a strange way, kind of embodies a Simpsons Treehouse of Horror madness and disturbing attitude about murder, voyeurism, obsession, and mendacity. While the film was not intended as a comedy, the film is intentionally bizarre and melodramatic to a point where how Hitchcock decided to deal with the MPA (Motion Picture Association, the pioneers of American film censorship).<br /><br />Its rather uneven charm and irony make for an engaging film that might make me want to see The Girl, another film about Hitchcock but working on The Birds starring Toby Jones and Sienna Miller.\\"
B004UPAIDK|1.0|What am I missing here? I am 30 minutes in and it just keeps getting worse. Why would anyone watch this?
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I must say \\"WOW\\" this is Retro game done right! If you love retro graphics especially alien shooters type of games you will find the graphics of this game are superb. Full screen glory with superb speed and agility. In the past I have liked playing [[ASIN:B009KEN87O Voxel Invaders]] but this one is even better. I like the colorful neon glow and fluid graphics. The music is done right and so are sound effects. Game-play is a pleasure by simply moving the ship using your fingers on the screen. Love it.<br /><br />Kudos! to the developer for a Retro game design done right! No questionable permissions. Download it if you love retro games & fast paced graphics you will enjoy this game.<br /><br />PS: Officially as per Amazon this game will not be compatible on first generation Kindle Fire which simply does not make sense as the developer has clearly mentioned Android OS 1.5 or above should be enough for it to run. Looks like some clerical error on Amazon's part to list this game incompatible with Kindle Fire. Having said, If you are tech savvy you can make this game run on first generation Kindle fire by \\"side-loading\\" it. Love playing it even more on original Kindle fire due to it's small size.<br /><br />Edit June 01,2013 : Still enjoy playing this game!<br />-----------------<br />When a lot of people gave feedback here on Amazon stating that it is not very obvious to find the 'exit' or 'quit' button the developer promptly released an updated version 2.7.0 to address those issues. You will now be able to gracefully exit the game by using Android 'back' button on your device or if you go to the 'main' menu you will find a tiny 'X' or  Pause  if you are playing the game on the top right hand corner of the screen that will also allow to quit or exit the game gracefully. - Thank you.
B000JIN3J8|4.0|One of the reasons Austen is still so compelling is that she depicts the tension between passion and order.  The ideal balance may have fallen more toward the order side in her time than it does today, but we still grapple with the same tension.<br /><br />This version fails almost entirely to depict the passion, and therefore does not do justice to Austen.  It refers to passion, e,g, in Lydia and Wickham's elopement, but doesn't make us feel it-- Wickham is handsome but not really seductive.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but the Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version is much better: more passion and closer to the book (who can improve on Austen's dialogue??).  For example, the screenplay of the version under review  leaves out the gorgeous lines Darcy says at the end about how he's been a selfish being all his life...and so would he still be but for her, \\"dearest, loveliest Elizabeth\\". This reveals the real reason he loves her (or at least one of the most important) and shows his essential goodness and integrity.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|Yeah it sure is simple in the very first few levels but it does get interesting after you complete some levels. The graphics are very good and cute. The Totem keeps mumbling something or the other in each level as you get acquainted with the rules of the game. You can skip the mumbling if you like. It installed fine on the original 'Kindle Fire' even-though it says \\"HD\\" and I am keeping this on my Kindle Fire and play few more levels and update the review later if needed. But for FAOTD I think it is a worth a try. If you are into puzzles and matching games you will like it.<br /><br />Have fun!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Like the game for its simile and easy to use, I find the  vibrations very annoying and consumes lot more battery power than needed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|challenging without having to decipher bad english<br />good graphics and plays well with sound off<br />would highly recommend to all age groups.<br />Picked this up free and don't regret it
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Andrew Marlowe has a great staff of writers, he draws you into the lives (intimate) of his characters.  He makes you want to watch & want more.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This case meets all my expectations.  It arrived earlier than expected and is exactly as described.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a case.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Intertwined with drama, wit, & charm.  Mr Marlowe never disappoints.  Beckett may not be a world renowned celebrity exposed to world of literature like Castle, but she's smart, sexy, tough, and to everyone's surprise more savvy about the world than Castle thinks, the posturing & flirting continues....
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I loved all the twists and turns in the book.  I would however like for the Kindle version to allow me to see the entire acknowledgements at the end of the book.  It really is a part of the total book.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle (Fillion) & Beckett (Static) are truly finding their way around their maze of personalities, their heart felt throbbing for each other is more than just ego posturing & turning into something more....
B002E01LLG|2.0|would give 2.5 stars if I could. story blows, fight scenes are mediocre at best. pretty much getting what you pay for here. full of the usual &#34;fighter&#34; movie cliches
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Great book! Recommend this book to anyone starting a business or interested in taking their business to the next level!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|After the style of Life Force, Gradius, Darius Twin, and Raiden, in Plasma Sky you simultaneously dodge oncoming bad guys and their shots while swerving to collect oncoming bonuses and power ups.<br /><br />On my Galaxy S3, gameplay is perfectly smooth and chaotic, and I felt like if I died it was my fault, not the controls. It is very engaging and doesn't wait long to get difficult.<br /><br />Good:<br />Great graphics (no these aren't retro graphics, they are simple HD line graphics)<br />Smooth consistent control, especially if you do touch or direct (I preferred Normal sensitivity touch)<br />Fast difficulty ramp<br /><br />Bad:<br />Audio permission (I'll manage my own volume, thanks)<br />Tiny stats and pause button in game, and no support for physical menu or back button, makes for costly pauses. Kind of important for a mobile game.<br />No explanation of power ups (can be easily learned though)<br />Heats up phone quickly. Possibly not the most efficient coding ever.<br /><br />Ugly:<br />Unavoidable, but your thumb has to cover part of the screen in touch mode, and tilt is never going to be precise enough for this style of game. Mouse or controller support, dev?<br /><br />Summary : Good with only minor niggles that don't really detract from gameplay.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Great cd! I love the artist. And it was a great price! The description was very accurate. Brand new in case and wrapping.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.  Challenging and simple puzzles keep it very entertaining.  I admit I used a hint or two.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|this game was out a while ago,  but the kindle store is now releasing it when its not popular anymore, still a good game, just got a little old, you should download it
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Hard to follow for me but it was a good movie... it's a chick flick but my boyfriend gave it 4 stars too.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|this is easily the best invader type game I've seen on Android. thanks Dec for making it app of the day.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Love the story and the dancing. This is one of my favorite movies. Could watch this movie over and over.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great book. Hysterical book. Loved it, sorry when it ended. Loved how the character (Drew) was talking to us as a reader. Can Not Wait from more from this author!!
1614270198|5.0|This book is a very easy read. Have a open mind when reading it and be willing to try the advice given. I must warn people this book can come across as preachy. Their is references to religion but do not let that scare you away! rather understand that you need not be religious to use these techniques! However faith is a necessity to have. Faith is a word often used with religion and can come off as a religious word but it is not. Faith is a attribute that man has been using since the beginning of time regardless if he believed in any religion or had none. When using the techniques of this book you will begin to take charge of your own life and shape your surroundings to your advantage. This is a book about actual thought and using thought to your advantage. Take the time to read it and more importantly take the time to use it.<br /><br />Knowledge, if it does not determine action, is dead to us. -Plotinus<br /><br />This book along with Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Magic of Believing by Claude Bristol, and  What to Say When you Talk To Yourself  by Shad Helmstetter are classics that entwine with each other. Study and use the knowledge in these books and success will come in any field of life
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Used the word N______R way to much very racist and embarrassing!!!!! I hate the word N--------R its so un educated sounding!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is absolutely amazingly fun.I build so much stuff an I can't stop!<br />I made everything imaginable.it also has cool multiplayer.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and the other two books in the Karla Trilogy are magnificent espionage novels, complex and rich in place and plot and characters. They are also a deep study of Britain during the cold war, a period when Socialism and Communism were making unprecedented inroads through British society and government. The books are a study of British society and its class structure.  The British Mi6, called the Circus in these books, fought and defeated the Nazis and drew many of their leaders from the upper class. The book draws a clear picture of these men, who are witnessing the decline and hopelessness of their country, and are struggling with ambivalent feelings towards the Communist tyranny they are fighting.  Author LeCarre also fought the Nazis during WWII, but as the cold war wore on he developed a deep distrust and even hatred towards America, and his feelings are mirrored in the book and its characters. If you are an Anglophile, an spy novel fan, a student of recent history, or any or all of these things, you will love the Karla Trilogy. If you make it through the first read, you will relish the second, and third, and fourth, and on and on.  After a lifetime of reading, the Karla Trilogy is right up there in my top rank.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Disney has done it again.  My granddaughter loves this show. It offers life's lessons in a wonderful way and only Disney can do.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just love how easily I was able to download this app and be able to download books and read them on my phone and my tablet. It's wonderful when traveling and provides good quality and convenient way of accessing books.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I think that the person that wrote this movie was taking some serious drugs. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry should find a better movie to act in.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It is a mixture of match-3 and and simplified adventure, like Puzzle Quest. It is not a rpg, nor does it have fancy graphics. If you like this style of diversion, it is great.
B00CW665VI|5.0|It took a few chapters to get into this book...I almost put it down but glad I didn't. I was not used to this writing style and took a while to get into. Drew was hard to like at the start but I warmed to him especially towards the end. Kate was near perfect. The book had some of the best written sex scenes I have ever read!! I thought Drew went a little overboard towards the end but still it was a great story. I would love to read more about the other characters too.
B009R659L8|5.0|I find Mary Higgins Clark's books entertaining and this one is no exception. It is a quick read and it keeps your interest.
B0086700CM|1.0|I couldn't play it!<br />I like the other with the colors, jewels and yo have to knock them out.<br />Not this.
B000000XB9|5.0|This great fun to listen to. It is so good to hear these songs again and I could enjoy it more.
030726999X|3.0|The book was just okay.  I felt the it tied everything from the first two novels together well.  What bothered me was at a certain point it became a not believable tale.  It was almost as if the characters had become super human or science fiction like for them to have been able to survive.  I could not suspend belief.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan is one of my husband's favorites musicians and he really has thoroughly enjoyed listening to the album.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|A competent Galaga clone that has gorgeous graphics and strong controls. If the controls had any lag then it would have killed this game. Fortunately the default controls are accurate and responsive. It allows you to dodge around the screen and fire back with accuracy.<br /><br />The graphics are well done and it looks like a mini laser light show.<br /><br />UPDATE: (Kindle Fire HD 7\\") For some reason the game starts to sputter and crawl as you progress past level 9 and it has nothing to do with the \\"slowdown power up\\". It's almost as if the CPU is taxed to the limit.
B004ELSDZK|2.0|After reading the description and reviews I decided to give the game a try. Bad choice! Vague instructions. Graphics are simplistic. Quite honestley, there are much better games available.  Game getting uninstalled right after finishing this review.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Just the classic twitter like online or on an iPhone. Works perfectly good, no problems at all. I recommend it.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Even my 4 years old nephews can play this game and they love it. It's addiction but because the you injured your finger :)
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app works great, it's just strange to use if you're used to the classic YouTube set up. I usually use YouTube on my iPhone, so soit works great, just different to use
B009EAO38C|5.0|friend turned me on to their youtube videos. had to get their works for portable player. purchased both 1st and 2nd album at the same time. very pleased with creativity and energy behind all pieces.
0823015033|5.0|going to be doing some sculpturing.<br />book has clear instructions and good photos.<br />I highly recommend this book<br />I teach hand building pottery and will adapt this polymer Clay to regular low fire clay.<br />thank you
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|5 stars for the first album. just loved the creativity they show for this one too. look forward to future works.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It works adequately for what it was created for. Basically,does what it's suppose to do. I liked that it's easy and to the point.
0988178532|5.0|OUTVIEW is filled with believable characters facing down unbelievable villains!  Teenage heroes and heroines whom I would be proud to know in real life.  Truth?  Or fiction?  Sometimes it's hard to tell.  The mysticism is fascinating, and I really wish it were all true!  The ending is perilous and I can't wait for Book 2.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I know that everyone is entitled to make a living but I was beyond annoyed that this book literally ended in the middle.  After reading two books and waiting a few months for this book to come out I was expecting that the story would be wrapped up.  In the past when I have read trilogies, each book could stand alone as a separate story.  Gone are those days.  Frankly,  Archer has lost me as a fan (and customer).  He is dragging out a story that is not that compelling.  Don't really care anymore what happens to any of the characters.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very nice app to relieve some stress! Good option to keep me interested with levels and multiplay. Kids love it too!
0062238868|5.0|I wanted to know how a sniper feels and thinks during the long hours spent training and shooting, either at a fake or to an actual target. I am writing a novel myself and I needed to know how it felt like, pausing, waiting, calculating the wind, the humidity, the distance. Appreciating the smell of the powder, the sound of the explosion, learning to love it. This book is incredible.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It lets you drive on different stuff it is a lot of fun you should get it it is a great game for kids to play
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is totally awesome! If you are thinking like this, \\"should I buy this book or not\\", GET IT!!!!!!!!!!! AWESOME!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is easily the most addicting game on my kindle. I stayed up and played just last night it is so addicting.I mean seriously Best Game Ever!!!!!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|What can I say about this book....... how about that I love it. This story takes a more dark tone and gets quite sad (trust me) yet you still wanted to read it. Also during this whole book you will be surprised, from start to finish. Read it!!!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Lego continues to impress. This model is great fun for the baby boomer - if you remember the 60's and 70's fondly, this will be a great conversation piece fro you!  Have fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The minecraft update was supposed to come out on the first week of May. Instead they are making kindle wait until September, really!!!<br />$till a pretty exotic game
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Great series! Cannot wait for the next volume in this wonderfully rich historical fiction series! Keeps you on your toes!
B001XV3LSS|1.0|Weak character development, lots of cheap moralizing. I normally like Jodie Foster, but this is a mess. Pairing her with Matthew McConaughey does not work.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great book. Didn't draw me in immediately, but once it got going, I was hooked. Great book. Can't believe I haven't read this book sooner
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just started playing. Liked the classic with the different patterns. Its a great way to unwind from stress. I'm looking forward to trying the other ways of playing. Would recommend this game to others.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Oddball Vonnegut with an intriguing and well assembled set of observations. Stark, often funny but eventually real....War at its very worst.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis made a great album! The quality of the mp3 files are fantastic & I listen to this almost everyday!
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Never read a better book, nor likely to soon. This classic is a must read, it should be compulsory in all schools too.<br />Watch the film as well.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Excellent movie, my Husband and I really enjoyed it.  We Highly recommend it. We will definitely watch it again soon.
B00932A4XE|4.0|If you're expecting to get some valuable intel on pregnancy, don't watch it. Otherwise it's a fun movie to watch, especially if you're currently pregnant or already have children,
B003O86FMW|4.0|I initially started to read this series because I have children (grown children) who love these books.  You know the rest - and I loved them, too.  After years of reading virually no light fiction, I read all three novels on my Kindle in quick succession, purposely building time into my weekends for them.  Now I'm sorry they're over!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Fast reponse from this seller.  This is a great buy at it's price.  My other controllers wore down after a while and I needed a new one.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book series is an amazing story of a mortal and an immortal whose fates are bound together. They have to over come many obstacles. This book has a mix of love (they are teenagers) and a lot of action.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|After watching the great Iron Man 3 film, I had to go back and buy Iron Man 1 and 2 on blue ray.  Classic film and well made adapation of the classic comic book.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I watch this film everytime it is available. I just bought my own copy. I cry with tears of joy,sadness and shear gut emotion.  The father's and brother's understanding of what drives Billy is rare. The final scene when this skinny little kid has turned into a fine muscular and beautiful man that leaps onto the stage absolutely destroys  whatever composure I have left. I am joyfully drained.
B00000251N|5.0|I recently heard a piece from this score and realized I hadn't listened to it in years.  It is just a uplifting and haunting as it was when I first bought it years ago in album form.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This movie is like the old classic spagetti westerns with a lot of spewing blood and dark humor.<br />It is a long movie, almost 3 hours, but riveting right from the start.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|As action flicks go, this one was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence does a bang-up job. The story concept stretched the bounds of my believability just enough and were not one I've seen 100 times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the best games of all not kidding the updates are awesome. You can play with people online their are so many mods for this game buy it its worth it
B005NFVZTM|2.0|The film has decent acting and special effects, but very boring screen writing. I was too distracted by the film's stupidity to appreciate the finer elements.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This mixer has great features for recording on a computer. I can use a microphone, guitar or other electric instrument either direct input or from a preamp output. It is not noisy and has level LEDs above the main mix knob to indicate volume. The case is solid which is probably why this 18 x 22 cm unit weighs an even kilogram. I recommend.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book.  Did not want it to end .  Have to wait for follow up book. Thanks for a great series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the fact that you can program the alarm to be a song, sound effect, or just about anything. I have this application on my phone and my kindle fire, (you should hear both of them go off at the same time, with different alarms). I love it.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|The animation is so realistic!! it has a very good, exciting story line that will keep you guessing and interested.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Quite a powerful story with great acting and direction to make it work... prepare to open your hearts! Don't miss this one.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I have only been playing for a few hours but its a pretty cool game and I like the art style.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is one that I consider absolutely essential! The information concerning the battery's condition gives me a very accurate idea how much more time I can spend on various types of uses before needing to charge the battery. It takes only a moment to get this extremely important information.  I highly recommend this app.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of his best!  I never figured out the terrorists plan. You can always count on Reacher to do the right thing when it comes to the &#34;bad guys&#34; -kill them!
B005XN0SGU|4.0|PerfectViewer is the best app I've yet found for reading comic books in CBR/CBZ format. The user interface is invisible until you tap certain areas of the screen, leaving the maximum amount of space for the page display. it has a plethoria of options for display, magnification, and so on.<br /><br />About the only problem I have with it is that, occasionally, it will crash when loading a file or turning the page. It seems to be a bit picky about certain files. Once it crashes to the Android home screen, I can usually relaunch it and reload the file, but I wish its error-handling was more robust so this wouldn't happen in the first place.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love the show Bones and every season is better then the next one. I highly recommend watching all the seasons
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app does exactly what the name implies, letting you read your Amazon Kindle books on Android devices. It connects and syncs with your Amazon account, you can shop for books right from the app, and it has all the usual features for reading e-books.<br /><br />My main complaint about it is that it doesn't always provide enough fine-grained control over font size and line spacing, and you can't choose the font a book displays in (the font seems to be determined by the publisher in most cases).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. I was getting tired if not being challenged and this game really works my brain with very few hints. There actually aren't the typical hints. You don't get any hints that tell you what to do. It's all on you to figure it out. LOVE IT...
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This is a great device for use between heavy cleanings.  The only thing I don't like is the trash collector is not attached to the sweeper.  I don't like reaching in the garbage bag to retrieve it.  Otherwise, it is a really nice sweeper.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It is just what one expects of Tina Fey with her straight forward humor. Made me laugh out loud at times.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|The tiles are too small and they on't light up well.  Just not much fun.  I don't recommend this game,
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always believed in life after death and am always delighted to read these stories as it strengthens my testimony of it.  This is a powerful story and I see the strength it took for Dr. Alexander to tell his fellow doctors this story.  I hope he and his family are at peace now.  Wonderful book.<br />  Joanne
B00AA0U05A|5.0|All we expected it to be. We will consider adding to this type of music in the future.  Thanks and GPBWY!!!!!!!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I am not a particular fan of space invaders, but this one is an amazing clone. The fact that one person made it by himself is just awesome. Another amazing game like this is voxel invaders for $1.28
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an exceptional game. The graphics are phenomenal. My only complaint is that it's too short. Th  puzzles are a lot of fun to figure out. It reminds me of Myst from a couple decades ago. Can't wait for the next chapter.
1250007305|2.0|I bought this book based on the reviews but it is not a 4.5 star book. Not even close. The plot is formulaic (cut-out Islamic terrorists want to take down the West, brilliant, handsome but humble computer consultant saves the world and wins the beautiful girl) the writing is very uninspiring, there is little depth beyond five or six characters, the language is pedestrian and reads like a technical manual, the ending is totally anti-climactic...I could go on. I had to force myself to read it.<br /><br />For much more interesting and well written books about tech gone wild, read Avogadro Inc (premise based on Gmail developing AI and taking over the world) or Daemon (Steve-jobs type dies and unleashes bots and daemons on the world)
B0079XPUOW|2.0|I was looking forward to this book and came away very disappointed . If you made a drinking game out of every time a line ended with \\"Dahl said\\" you would pass out in the first few chapters. I hardly ever critique grammar or sentence structure, but the sheer laziness of the overuse of the same words over and over grated on my nerves and kept me from becomming immersed in the story. No big loss though, because the story was lame. This book was such a great idea but the execution was underwhelming. I felt like I was reading a high school writing class assignment. No character depth. No investment. And the audiobook version was even worse with Wil Wheaton's cheesy delivery. As the voice of this character, he just emphasizes the problems and sounds annoying. Irritatingly overpriced even after reduced to $8. the irritation over the price was of course after reading.<br /><br />One of my favorite authors, Rothfuss (a witty genius), reviewed this book as one of the funniest he had ever read.  After reading the book, I have to conclude he was amused at the attempt rather than the intended humor.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|If you're looking to find out what has changed over the years this is a nice point to start. Don't expect too many technical explanations or in depth discussions as you will not find it, but for me it was a good way to get up to date in the world behind the web.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|fantastic story, characters were well developed, plot lines made sense, and it was fun be reminded of all the 80's pop culture. did not want the book to end!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Engrossing, multi-layered story.  Each character is unique and has a complex story.  This show is hard to watch for it's intensity but compelling none-the-less.  Do not watch alone or in the dark.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|You can't argue with success. Star Trek, in all of it's versions, has mass appeal. If it didn't, it wouldn't still be current in the entertainment world. I've seen each ep of TOS in excess of 100 times, and I still enjoy them.It influenced more than a single generation, and continues to do so. Watch it, enjoy it, and live long, and prosper.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Sort of like a super indie 8-bit Puzzle Quest, but less Might and Magic RPG and more Rogue-like.  Pretty easy to &#34;finish&#34; in a couple days, but good for a few play throughs.  I also appreciated the lack of pay-for-upgrades that most games like Jetpack Joyride or Temple Run have thrown in.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I am a Premium member so all the functionality of the desktop program comes to me in mobile form.  All my essential passwords are with me and it a fine way to add bookmarks for secure sites to my Kindle Fire HD.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|It's obvious I'm a Baz Luhrmann fan, but honestly if I were putting together a soundtrack, these are the artists I would've picked. It's like he raided my CD collection to choose these people. Some of the songs sound even better in their entirety than they do set in the movie ($100 Bill being the prime example, which is a bit awkwardly placed in the film but is excellent as a full song). Best $15 I ever spent.
B009IF8CH6|3.0|The premise seems to be getting a little stale; it would help for me anyways if the characters gained a little more depth.  Right now, they're all basically tropes.
B005I548B4|5.0|Has the same base story line as other Nicholas Sparks books but this is my favourite by far, so sad but so hard to put down.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|This book will blow your mind. I recommend this book to those who have some guts and love mystery.  I've been teased how I didn't watch the HungerGames or read the book but now I've read the book and can't wait to tell my friends!!!
0345803485|4.0|I love reading, even though I don't get to do it often. I've read a lot of different books at only the age of 20 and I have to say this book has given me the most utmost startle I expected.<br /><br />I heard the rant about the book for about a year or so and I finally decided to read it starting Monday that passed (The 20th). The first book actually took me by COMPLETE surprise. I didn't read the reviews, ask advice or anything. Just picked up the book and started to read. By the first 3 chapters I was captivated and took me about a day and a half to finish the first book. Then I got the second and the third.<br /><br />The thing about this book is that it is an acquired taste, like sushi, or caviar. You start reading and it honestly reflects the Twilight Saga for the entire time. Young girl finds mysterious man, denies she likes him, falls in love,he says he's trash, they have sex, they fight, people try to kill them... blah blah blah; it's what you expect high school student to read. However, the plot has a ring to it that I find rather interesting. I absolutely love the way they speak to each other, the amount of love they have for each other, the difficulty of their relationship and the intensity they have for each other.<br /><br />Anastasia annoys the crap out of me just like Bella did, but I am kind of anti-romantic. The fact of the matter is she's a pre-teen underneath a woman's body, and Christian Grey (a fine work of man) is the same, but a man's body of course. Their sex is over-the-top, exhilarating  and after a while BORING. There is absolutely no way you can have an orgasm by having your breasts sucked and pulled. Maybe in this universe, or just not mine. He looks at her, she orgasms, he kisses her hand, she gets wet, he looks at her, she can't breathe, he speaks, SHE ORGASMS, they play, she want to jump his bones. She's an idiot, but an idiot in love.<br />Christian is what almost every woman wants in a man or what we should expect. He's a freak, over-bearing, controlling, overprotective, somewhat narcissistic, over the top, wealthy, effervescent (in his own way), lovable, fragile MAN. EVERY MAN on the face of the earth is like that, to some degree.<br />A lot of people experience love in a different type of way, and express their feelings in different ways, Christian has sex to the end of the world and Anastasia is just an idiot that cries almost all the time for ANY slight emotion. Love can do that to people, if you don't fully understand the concept of a man-woman relationship or what it should entail.<br /><br />Fact of the matter is that, the book has it's good... and it's bad, like anything in life. After a while I got bored as hell and I could tell what was going to happen. However, the whole idea behind the book captivated me in a way which no book really has. I read the entire series within 6 days. All 3 books, front to back, line for line, word for word. It is a good book, however, it could have had a lot more potential.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|From the first time I listened to this album, I liked it quite a bit. On subsequent listens, I've only grown to like the album more. The poppy songs that at first mildly annoyed me are now some of my favorites. Overall, this is a very varied and enjoyable album.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG I laughed so hard in some parts I got the hiccups! I'M a new reader of Emma's not anymore I loved this book it was so fresh and so real fanfreakingtastic  truly a great love story!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love to sync my data and be able to share it by sending a link to it. I recommend it for anyone who likes to remember everything they do.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story is told from the man's perspective, and without a doubt one of the funniest,sexiest books I've read in along time.  I have never laughed so hard, and then thought gosh what ding dongs men can be.  Read it , enjoy because it's great!  I'm hoping  there will be more, and told through a guy's eyes cause women really are an a enigma to them. They are laughingly clueless.
B008EKMB82|5.0|For a story that deals with shame and loss, this is a surprisingly satisfying tale. Ruth Ozeki writes of science, politics, exploration of Japanese culture, descriptions of profound cruelty, and guidance toward healing.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|this is the best thing to come out of this channel in a long time, probably ever. my only complaint is that there are only 9 episodes. please start making the next 3 seasons at least or dial it up to 20+ episodes for next year. i love this story. some of these characters really exist in history books and they are using the archeological evidence found over the last 20 years or so so it has a realness that other viking shows lack.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I just love this cd it's one of my favorite . Came on time and in good conduction. I really enjoy it in my car on my way to work.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I played on it a lot. when I got on it I cheacked all my worlds and they were all gone exept for painting!  :(
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I grew up on TOS. The relationships, the adventure, and the coolest Captain of them all. Highly recommended watch for any age!
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I have tried updating it but it will not sync. with my laptop. The forms we use at work i was trying to use on my phone. I works fine if you want to Bluetooth back and forth.
1476734941|4.0|He hasn't been consistent so far but the thing he likes about the diet is that you can eat normally 5 days a week.  It is well written and makes a case for the health benefits of fasting.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This is a great album.  Probably the best I've bought this year.  There isn't a bad song on the album, and several of the songs are out-of-this-world good.
0743497465|5.0|I just started the book, I'm up to chapter 22. But keeps you wondering what is going to happen. I don't want to burn out and just throw the book. So I'm taking a rest. It'll keep me interested for a long time.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great mix of horror and drama - if you like shows like Lost, Heroes etc you'll quickly get hooked on the walking dead
B001UN1KVE|5.0|I've literally watched this movie every night before bed since i received it. Definitely a movie for every generation. If you haven't seen \\"Spaceballs The Movie,\\" watch it. What are you waiting for?
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is a very funny book Grover is scared that there is a monster at the end of the book and he is the monster.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|After hearing reviews from Leo Laporte, Tom Merritt, Brian Brushwood, Justin Robert Young and more, not to mention hearing him talk on the Geek & Sundry network, I knew I needed to give Patrick Rothfuss a shot.<br /><br />Long story short; one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. The characters are fun and unique, and the plot, while somehow taking place in a school setting within a story being told within a story, had me staying up until the early hours of the work week to find out what happened next to the hero Kvothe. Only 8 seconds after finishing this, I had already purchased The Wise Man's Fear. If it's half as good as The Name of the Wind, it's going to be a painful wait for book 3.
B00BLSJI80|4.0|As a Demi fan, I was dissapointed with Unbroken, I didn't liked it at all but I was still a fan. So I was hoping that her next album would be better and it is! \\"Demi\\" has a different range of songs: party songs (not all of them, in my opinion are good, just fillers or probably commercial songs that eventually will become singles) like \\"Neon Lights\\", \\"Really Don't Care\\", \\"Something That We're Not\\", strong songs like \\"Heart Attack\\", and the ones that really make this album worth the buy and they show her amazing voice like \\"Made in the USA\\", \\"Nightingale\\", \\"In Case\\", \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" and \\"Warrior\\", and not only her voice, but the meaningful lyrics and the arrangements were pretty good. I think Demi still has a lot to show, her early demos show an amazing voice, so I think she should move to another label as soon as possible, Hollywood Records always holds back their artists and I think Demi can easily find another label with her talent.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a great improvement from Unbroken, I can see more involvement from her and the lyrics feel more human and less generic. Any Demi fan won't be dissapointed with her new album, and even people that are not her fan they will enjoy it. Buy it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The best book by far that I have ever.read it..explained everything perfectly and awesomely it also was cool becausi  it was awesome
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I'm in love with this album! Since I got it I listen to it everyday. The whole album is addicting and Vampire Weekend never dissapoints, and \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" is no exception. It has a very different sound if you compare it to \\"Contra\\", but overall, I think this album is still very strong. The lyrics are more mature, the music is dreamy and very upbeat, and the vocals from Ezra Koenig are amazing. My favorites are \\"Obvious Bicycle\\", \\"Step\\", \\"Don't Lie\\", \\"Everlasting Arms\\", \\"Ya Hey\\" and \\"Young Lion\\".
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I ordered this for my grandson and he loves it.  Put it on My Kindle and he knows what to do.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I usually love Jeffrey Archer's book, but this one is a little contrived and unsatisfying.  I hope the next one in this group is better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's not like temple run. It has subways that move, don't have to tilt your tablet, and has great goals for you to do.
0590259385|4.0|My neice loved this book.  My granddaughter likes it.  She likes it when I make different sounding voices for the different animals as I read this to her.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|They don't do very much challenged. Just draw lines. Over all most of it can help your brain. That's ok.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so much fun and addicting its like temple run but much better I love it when you change cities from new York to Tokyo Australia I love it I definitely rcomend this game for people who love temple run because its the same sort of deal so download this app
B009YG2ND8|4.0|great ff game play. would have been five stars but it was too short,all in all it was worth the 15.99
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator.  I would recommend to others.  Easy to see and can't beat it for free.  Any age would love it.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|The entire show was great! Exciting and motivational for wanting to be a better person and overcoming your fears. The end was very cool.
0743435729|4.0|While I loved this book it did start out a little slow in comparison to Basilisk Station, but that very fast compaired to most Science Fiction! I read a lot of science fiction, and I have a collection of world war II history that some friends envy. The Honor Harrington series combines the two in a very special way.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I just love this story.<br />I recommend watching  the  DVD and forget about reading the book.<br />Superb performance of the main and secondary characters, especially John Thornton's mother.<br />I am an Anglofile and watch anything English . I adore the crisp English tones ,towns and countryside.<br />I have watched this miniseries quite a few times.<br />The final scene where John and Margaret acknowledge their love for one another always bring tears to my eyes.<br />What can I say, I am romantic.!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire. Looks good too. Helps me with tips and with the check book. The kids can use it for homework as it has everything they need.
B0031RSATC|5.0|As an ex Army Medic and an ex Registered Nurse... I found this book entertaining, confronting, stimulating, exciting and more....It is a book I can read and reread many times (I HAVE) and talk about among friends and family....You will know any good nurse, doctor or paramedical professional immediately when you say such words as &#34;GOMER&#34; (and they KNOW you are not referring to an old US TV comedy show about the USMC) or BUFF, TURF...etc...A combination of M*A*S*H, Catch 22, House and more... An all time CLASSIC book HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a movie that definitely makes you think especially about our current situation with our environment and food sources.The environment and consumerism are a major theme in this movie. It really makes you think about what is going on our world today. If you watch this movie, be prepared to do a lot of critical thinking.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like playing just hat all of the Ads.  I do not want to pay more so I just deal with it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Can not get some of my bonuses using the app off my kindle, but I am able to keep up with other facebook  status.
B00005LK94|5.0|Love this movie, it is as good for adults as kids and even young ones should get some enjoyment out of it. The flying scenes and music are beautiful.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautifully written love story.  Difficult to read, impossible to put down, all the characters realistic and easy to understand their opinions and feelings.  It has been a very long time since I have read a book this good.  Smiles, laughter, tears and lots of sympathy and LOVE.  Excellent read
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me literally laughing out loud in places! Very interesting \\"male\\" point of view. I would definitely read something else by this author & have recommended this book to my friends!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Start with book one, you'll end up at book three soon enough: the story is just too good to leave off. And there is also my only point of critique: I got a bit tired of the reminders to the second and first book because those were fresh in my memory. There were even some references to previous chapters which I felt were obsolete. I shredded through the story full of unforgettable and loveable characters whom keep on captivating you throughout and depict the whole spectrum between good and evil. The imagery is glorious. The plot in the third book fell together perfectly. Some may find a few passages overly dramatic, but it is all worth it.
0811870413|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my daughter who is a Foodie through and through. She was overjoyed and put it to use right away. Within a day, our family was enjoying the first recipe she used. She loved the instructional elements of the book as well!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a little bit difficult to navigate around with. The controls are a bit sensitive. But overall a good game.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Watched this going over to China.. For some reason one of the shows didn't download.. but I knew what happened.. but very good series.. I will watch more if they have it..
B00CWV8X04|3.0|Is kind of predictble, actually i felt sleep and i did not see the end, so that was expensive and i did not have fun.<br />Thank you
078322611X|5.0|worked great great price. Good family movie my boys love it . and are trying to wear it out. Its nice to find affordable movies.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I love the bejeezus out of this app. Google perfected the RSS reader IMO. But now it's going away--an all to frustrating occurrence in the tech word. highly recommended, for now.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|When it actually loads, it's kind of fun. But, often, it only fills half the screen and gets really glitchy. And it doesn't seem like updates fix that (for mine, anyway). It also seems really hard to earn enough coins to expand Ponyville. You just end up paying the Apple Picking game over and over.<br />In short, it's a free game and you get what you pay for.
1476734941|3.0|It is a clearly written book and very informative. Found it difficult to fast if you exercise a lot but can adjust it to your lifestyle. Did feel better fasting and stomach definitely settled down. Don't know if people trying to lose a lot of weight would find it easy. Does take discipline and planning.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|My first Baldacci book - he is imaginative and skillful as a writer. I look forward to exploring his other books as well.
0765325950|5.0|It satisfied my 30 year quest for the ending of so many questions revealed in the earlier books of the series.<br />It makes me want to read the entire series again, just for continuity.
0062213423|5.0|A must for 1D fans. Excellent photographs in a high quality edition. The price incredible! Recomended for anyone who wants to give a nice present with an small Budget.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love it! This was the world best book I read.I would like to see if you could find a better
B00785P2QC|5.0|A good game get Money easy I would recommend it a bit like build games but vehicles make it good very fun
B0040HO01Y|3.0|I like period drama.  The characters are original, but the screneplay lacks the luster of other period movies and shows.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Have seen this documentary &#34; Searching for Sugar Man &#34; twice. Loved the music so following my first viewing of the movie had to get the  Cold Fact CD. Than saw the movie again with my son a musician. And Of course we both enjoyed it immensely. Following my second viewing I ordered this second CD coming From Reality. Then ordered both CDs Cold Fact and Coming to Reality for my son. Since this is a review about  Rodriguez's CD I wont comment any  more about his movie. The CD which I received yesterday and still need to finish is wonderful, brilliant lyrics by a man who's voice is beautiful. Do try and get the movie as it adds another dimension to his songs and is a must see.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The movie shows that not all students are bullies.  And there are friends to be made for everyone.  No one can get through life alone.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|Found this to be just as good. Read it awhile back so may be forgetting a few things. The story was well written as Franzen is a gifted writer, a master of words, perceptive and has a sense of humor. the subject matter in Freedom was good and creative. Loved his book Corrections which is entirely different then Freedom is possibly  a bit lighter as it doesn't revolve around parents aging and falling apart.  I say read both, Corrections first then Freedom next. Why do it this way? Maybe because I did!!!!!!
0785168109|2.0|The book was well presented, but in the end, it just looked like a ton of production stills even though they were hand sketched. I was looking forward to set design blueprints like the house or set blueprints and detail designs of the suits.  Basically the book was nothing more than production stills with a few storyboards added for \\"effect\\".  Fairly lame in the end.  Not one of the better \\"Art of Books\\".
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Have both this CD and purchased Coming from Reality yesterday. Both CDs are wonderful. This mans writing I find both moving and brilliant.  I have seen the movie Searching for Sugar man twice. The second time I watched with my son, another budding musician. He was mesmerized by the film and so I purchased him both Cold Fact and Coming from Reality. As a young person in the late 50's and 69's it stuns me how such a talented man could disappear, no records, simply nothing. I am so grateful to the folks that took the time and energy to track him down. The movie tells all and is an amazing story. SOOO get movie and both CD's , esp if you have older sons who are musicians or just enjoy listening to music ....is a good bonding experience
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|this game is worth buying and playing. It's not short but it's neither drawn out and boring. The plot is good too. I'm so getting the sequel.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Just finished singing the high praises of Rodriguez's two albums: Cold Fact and Coming From Reality from late 1970,s and 1971. Now for the movie, I loved it and have seen it twice. Shared with my older son a musician and he was amazed. We both found this documentary to be inspirational and almost fiction in content BUT NO is real and an amazing..  Rodriquez an extremely talented musician disappears in the late 70's and during that time becomes the best selling, number 1 artist which continues for 20 + years in South Africa !  However, he was never heard in the USA. Ironically, he lived and recorded his first album in Detroit Michigan !  Maybe in the 70's we boomers were too caught up in whatever to notice? BUT he became one of the biggest rock stars in Cape town from the 1970's to the present. This is an amazing TRUE story! Warning, bring kleenex :0) and know his song Sugar man will be stuck in your brain for days!
0452287022|5.0|Not being much of a reader of historical fiction I wasn't sure if I was going to like this but it's a very interesting read.<br /><br />The idea of weaving around a story around a famous painting is a great one and Chevalier has conveyed both a sense of place and time very well in the book. The prose is simple but effective. Griet, the narrator, is forced to take a job as a maid to the painter Vermeer's family after her father is blinded in an accident at work. She immediately develops a huge crush on the man of the house and believes that he has some feelings for her. Let's get one thing straight though, Griet is an unreliable narrator and her perceptions of Vermeer can't be trusted. She obsesses over every tiny gesture he makes and word he speaks in a way that was very believable for a teenage girl. She is drawn to him because he is mysterious, powerful and treats her better than everyone else. She also needs something to distract her from her miserable life as a house maid. She fantasises about usurping his horrible wife, and Catharina recognises the threat this attractive young woman poses to her household.<br /><br />Let's get another thing straight - this is no love story (in the same way The Great Gatsby isn't a love story, Baz Luhrmann). It's a study of class relations and power, and the way these things warp people and relationships. Griet's family are at the bottom of the social ladder after her father's accident. The Vermeer's are clearly much better off than Griet's family but they have money problems too and are reliant on the wealthy but sleazy benefactor who buys most of Vermeer's paintings. This is a very distressful situation for Vermeer, especially when the man wants a painting of Griet as an excuse to seduce her, and tries to force himself on her every time he comes to the house. Pieter is a decent man who wants to marry Griet but she resists the life of drudgery and servitude she knows will be hers as a butcher's wife, instead escaping into her fantasies about Vermeer. Marriage was the only escape for a woman back then, and Griet never even considers that she too could be an artist despite her obvious gift because it just wasn't in the realm of possibility. She also resents the power Pieter has over her family who are unable to afford decent cuts of meat without him.<br /><br />In the house Griet is also at the bottom of the heap until Vermeer stands up for her and everyone, including his wife, must start treating her with more deference. Although Vermeer is portrayed as a good man who teaches Griet how to mix paints so she can be his assistant, I don't think he has any real romantic interest in her beyond a slight attraction that he resists. He inadvertently makes Griet's life more miserable by turning Catharina and Taanneke against her because he is obsessed with his art above all else and isn't tuned into the tensions in the house. Because the women are dependent upon Vermeer they are constantly watching, listening and trying to assert themselves over the others. To people with no power the smallest gestures are laced with significance and that's why the earrings represent such a betrayal to Catharina. (You'd think that installing Griet in the attic above his studio where he had access to her at all time would have been much worse for Catharina. Maybe she assumed he was sleeping with her and was willing to turn a blind eye, but allowing the lowly housemaid to wear her earrings was putting them on equal footing, something she couldn't tolerate).<br /><br />In the end, Vermeer's absorption in his art makes him just as selfish in his own way as the philanderer he could have been. This is obvious when he forces the pearl earring through Griet's infected earlobe and then makes her pierce her other ear even though it's not even seen in the painting, remembering that infections could be deadly at this time. (Maybe I just have a dirty mind but I thought the sexual innuendo was a bit clunky in this section. Afterhe's put the final touches on the painting he wipes his palette knife which is covered in white paint. She waits for him to come into the storeroom and touch her when she is getting changed but \\"now that the painting was finished he no longer wanted me.\\")<br /><br />The petty jealousies and intrigues were the strongest part of the book for me because Chevalier shows a real understanding of how it would have been in the past when servants were such an intimate part of family life, but at the same time so separate due to their lower status. The weakest parts were the characterisation of Catharina and Cornelia who were too one-dimensional, but to be fair we only see them through Griet's eyes and she is very biased. The whole hair thing didn't make much sense and should have been left out because it seemed ridiculous that Griet would run off and have sex with Pieter just because Vermeer had seen her hair uncovered. Like the other symbolism with the knife the wild hair (representing desire) that she had to keep contained was too clunky.<br /><br />The fact that this book is at its core about money and power is reinforced by the ending when Griet sells the earrings Vermeer left to her, clearing the Vermeer family's debt with Pieter for their meat. She has been brought and sold like a piece of meat and even Vermeer was guilty of treating her like a commodity, while at the same time giving her glimpses into a world of art and beauty she could never be part of, except in her dreams. 4.5 stars
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|A fascinating book. Well worth the read, even in just 3 weeks it has changed my life. As a mother of three I was looking for more energy and this has given it to me in spades as a positive side effect I have also lost 4 kg and counting.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Using it to convert recipes that I will be making. It will also be helpful checking the grandchildren's math homework.
1451668945|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but didn't think it was as good as many of the others she has authored.  I thought it left unanswered questions when it ended.  I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books, but didn't like this one as well as others.
B0094D462M|5.0|Great movie, have seen it a number of time and it is always very entertaining.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent series, glad I found the DVD on Amazon, that's what online shopping is all about! Quick- easy and the price was right!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a very beautiful game.the developer is very talented and smart.kudos to you!if you have made other games,I would certainly buy them.
1476734941|5.0|- this is like no diet book I've ever picked up. This doctor speaks to me and this may be the best diet book out there
1609611543|4.0|I absolutely love wheat, but gave it up, 3 months now,  after reading this book.  I still have a wheat belly, but I have more energy and feel more focused..
B0037NVM2C|5.0|The movie was remarkably well done for the year.  The special effects were pretty good for the age of the movie.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|It is entertaining and funny. The more I watched, the better the story.  I will buy Season 2 if reasonably priced.
B001DTTG16|3.0|This movie's music did not disappoint, but the story line was not as exciting as it seemed to be when I saw it as a teen.  The acting was a bit off too.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book gives you an eyeopening behind-the-scenes look at  convenience foods. It delves into the research behind how they are engineered, the psychology behind how the are advertised, and the powerful forces at play when it comes to attempts to make them healthier. It's not written as a diet book, but I am most definitely changing my diet as a result of reading it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|A great read - picked it up right after reading Chris McDougall's book Born To Run, and although I don't know if anything could top that, this book gets very, very close. The combination of Scott Jurek's narratives about his family life and childhood, combined with all of his awesome racing stories are fabulous. Add in the recipes interspersed throughout the book, and you have an epic read that is part biography, part cookbook, and thoroughly enjoyable. This is a book I'll read again.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The only thing I didnt like was at a certain point u cant buy anything with gold just gems that you need to buy

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Although I did not enjoy the escape from the goblin scene which seemed so unrealistic, I enjoyed very much the relationship between Bilbo and the Dwarves, especially Thorin. The scenery in Rivendell was wonderful. I wondered what they were doing with Radagst but accepted what they did with that character. All in all they kept the feeling of the original masterpiece which mixed childhood wonder with cruelty of real life.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It's very different from your typical musical. The songs get stuck in your head very easily. Wouldn't mind purchasing the soundtrack.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book not only makes me want to be better at everything but it also gives me the tools to be better at everything! Outstanding! Keep up the excellent work Tim! Cheers!<br /><br />ljb
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This story took many twists and turns. The back and forth was a little confusing at times. Did not see the final twist coming.
B007YJ8ZRK|4.0|Loved this creative movie...simple, entertaining, well done! I would recommend this for a friday night, popcorn eating, unwinding end of the week flick.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|We purchased this for a freind for her birthday. She has 'everything Bon Jovi', so we hope that she will like adding this to her collection.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|BEAUTIFUL..very emotional. Stunning story, in every way...the way it was captured on fil even. Stellar acting. Stirring movie, stays with you...as it should!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Sookie ~ it has been a wonderfully paranormal, hot and heavy, unpredictable and often times unputdownable ride.  I will miss you, Bill, Eric, and Sam as well as everyone else in Bon Temps.<br />Thank you to Charlaine Harris for closure - I had a feeling it would end something like it did and I was pleased - so sorry to hear about all of the haters and spoilers but this True Blood Fan is sad to see the series end but you know what?<br />It was a great adventure and I am thankful for finding Sookie, her crazy and spicy relationships and her stories.......
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I think the game is really cute but it would be a lot more fun if it wasn't expensive. I am stuck now and can't progress any further without paying.
B0091REZMW|4.0|very entertaining game. keeps me entertained for hours. very easy to understand. i would recommend this game to other people if they are into these types of games
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I can see why some people might not enjoy this album, but I like the collaboration feel it has.  Some of the songs could have had more depth, but overall enjoyable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|now have my husband all caught up and ready for the next season. watched back to back seasons 2 or 3 episodes a night , make it too easy!!can't wait for the next season
0545091020|5.0|Great recording, very satisfied. The woman's voice is a little slow and strange though but very clear and easy to understand. The set has 9 discs; It would be nice if they could be combined.
B00499NHLC|3.0|it is enjoyable a little odd but a different spin on Sherlock.  I would watch especially when i'm caught up on all my regulars
B0097HSS4M|5.0|this game is better then the last one i played. the color is good and few of the items were hard to find.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I went into this book half expecting a sloppy over apologetic mother who didn't believe that her own child could be born broken. It was quite opposite. Denial, love, and society's double standards all came together to craft a beautiful and heart breaking story.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is great.  Fast pace action. Controls are very responsive... felt thirty years younger when playing.  Installed on Motorola Xoom.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not put the book down but it was a downer from the begining. Not enough light areas. Did not like the ending but<br />truly understood it. I think I would have finished it differently. I will try another book by this arthur, but only one<br />more. Not a feel good book.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie will bring you to tears, and find you holding your loved ones a little closer.  It is difficult to imagine the horror that so many families went through that horrible day after Christmas. The special effects were great, very real to the images in the news afterwards. A movie worth seeing for sure. 5 Stars for the actors too!!!
0736041850|5.0|I have always been fascinated in musculature and the interaction of muscles to do work. My classes in anatomy and physiology helped with that, but this is real world application. When doing a bicep curl, with this book it is possible to see and know which muscles should be active and involved. If too few, or too many, muscles are active then the exercise is being done wrong. Excellently drawn and detailed depictions of the muscles of the human body in motion.
B006LSZECO|4.0|So many twists and turns.  Every time I thought I figured things out, I was wrong.  The author had to keep great notes to tie so many things together .
0307887960|5.0|My dad's heart doctor actually recommended this diet for him to follow.  Reading the book has helped to come up with an easy to follow meal plan for him to follow.  This is important for my dad...he does not like complicated.  Hoping to be able to continue with this process and get good news when we go back in three months!
1596680199|5.0|This is definitely one of the best books for the beginner and advanced crafters in Poly-clay. It is great for continued reference use and the directions are clear and concise...wonderful projects.<br />Recommend to all users.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Can't wait to get the next one!! This series totally  has me hooked and reading every spare minute I have.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This book was exactly what I wanted it to be. It was funny in the parts that it needed to be and the ending codas were amazingly deep and sincere. The main story is an easy read and made enough ridiculous sense that it was a perfect fix for a Star Trek fan. It made fun of the show in a way that wasn't insulting or derogatory but humorous and apt. It brought light to all the little plot holes and non sensible deaths that the original series of Star Trek suffered from but still glorified the show and its fans.<br /><br />The codas were humanizing and exactly what was needed to bring closure to the characters outside the main story.<br /><br />I would read this book again, definitely.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Once you get started reading this series of books, you can't wait for the next one!  I also watch the tv series.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is fun. I have a great time connecting the dots and I like to try and get a perfect score. Also like free flow and bridges.  Need more!
B004YW4L5K|3.0|I have not read this book yet because I have too many to read.  I'll get to it in a few weeks.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I love how fast it got to me. I was very impressed it. I was really happy with it YAY!!
B001LM1456|4.0|Very good light entertainment -- definitely need to &#34;suspend disbelief&#34; if you know any science at all, but wonderful fun wish-fulfillment.  Lovely way to get your mind off troubles in the real world and just relax for a couple of hours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app!  I'm am constantly on it :-) love looking at all the things & finding recipes to make for the kids it's awesome!
B000I3UMLQ|1.0|I am always wanting to like and enjoy them. What was this movie doing? I am a bit confused as to why they made it and what plot it has, if any. I found the unusually well functioning ship now falling apart to be the only refreshingly new idea. This movie is certainly a stew with anything usable just thrown in for flavor, but unfortunately, just as in real cooking, the stew is not tasty without design and focus.<br />There is nothing to see here. Even God is a man with a white beard. Who really thinks that? Too much to complain about here.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Cheap sometimes stops working but then reboots itself back to another page you were on. I contacted Amazon about it they told me to uninstall then rebut to get the updated version since then working fine.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I have been anticipating Daft Punk's new album and getting this gem before it was released was just enough to hold me over.  Great song, catchy lyrics, makes me want to dance.  I think that's what Daft Punk was going for, right?
B000F5EEU2|5.0|Great way to get your child into positive kind of music. My daughter and I enjoys their music. This was a great bye!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The three books in this series are awesome.  You can not put them down.  The books keep you on the edge of your seat and you just want to know how it ends.  Really well written.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|All I have to say about this movie is that it is an Aladeen film and it deserves a 5 star rating.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The three books in this series are awesome.  You can not put them down.  The books keep you on the edge of your seat and you just want to know how it ends.  Really well written.  It is really unbelievable that this could happen to one person in their life time
B0060Q57JW|5.0|I read the reviews which were negative about the cardboard liners used to ship the individual disc which caused severe scratches. The set I received which encompassed seasons 1 thru 10 are box sets which have no cardboard and each individual disc is held securely in it's on holder. Absolutely there are no problems. The digital quality of the DVD'S for viewing is excellent with no glitches, skips or pixel loss. I received exactly what I expected and at a excellent discount so I am completely satisfied and can recommend this product and the store which sold and shipped it. The transaction, shipment. price and the quality could not have been better.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|The three books in this series are awesome.  You can not put them down. The books keep you on the edge of your seat and you just want to know how it ends.  Really well written.
B000JCSBU0|1.0|I saw this film quite by accident many years ago.  I do not advise anyone watch this film.  It was heralded as an arty film at the time, however, this could not be further from the truth.  The producers simply wanted to shock and horrify you. This film should be called \\"Don't do any sort of drug\\"  This film is basically a HORROR flick with self harm, too many flashes and camera effects that make one feel ill, and X rated sex (rape overtones) scenes and hallucinations (also nauseating...seriously..)
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Even though I only play the Arcade Mode, this game is absolutely fantastic. I've had it for years on my iPhone and now I have it on my Android. Too bad I couldn't migrate my high score.<br /><br />The game is mindless fun. Addictive by nature, even though you need luck AND skill to get high scores.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have to thank my friend Alicia for gifting this book to me.  Drew is a pretty boy successful investment banker who sleeps with a different woman every time he gets the urge.  That is until he meets  Kate brooks.  Kate is a new employee in his firm, she impresses him on a professional level.  He gets to know her and their attraction develops into a romance.  The problem is that they are both afraid of their feelings for each other.  When Drew screws up royally she is too scared to give him a second chance.  Watching Drew struggle to win Kate back was so much fun.  The dialogue in this book is hilarious.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|If you love rock music from the 80s and early 90s You must see thus movie.<br />I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he rocks in this movie.<br /><br />Delivery was on time.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I Love Love this season! I wasn't a fan of the season with Julia Stiles in it, even though I love her acting! I just thought it was weird that Dexter had a partner... Until this season when things turned and secrets came out!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The storyline and animation were enjoyable and the minions were simply adorable! To keep children and/or grandchildren entertained I happily give this 5 stars.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I hadn't heard of these guys until recently. Upon hearing their unique sound (mostly the vocals) I was hooked. bam.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Every time I go to the main menu to turn off peaceful mode or whatever, then come back to my game, all of the things in my inventory have disappeared. I lost six diamonds to this problem! PLEASE fix it!! If you can't, then I would like it if you could consider hiring someone to help!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the way the characters grew and interacted with each other the longer the book went on. No boring parts lots of action and great storyline!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Anyone who loves a book that keeps you on your toes and loves weird and creepy this author keeps you wanting to read more and more. Hard to put his books down!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Wonderful app with good flexibility. I use it to block out noise on the bus commute,  at work to focus calmly on a task, and hopefully to get a good night's sleep.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|I love Darius's new album! Can't get enough of him!! Love love love! I have been following him since he was Hootie loved him then too.  I a glad he went out on his own.  Such a beautiful voice.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I have a phenomenal idea about a game show and I had to purchase The Women that was made in old and new Hollywood.  Stay tune.
1401238580|4.0|The prelude to this tale, written several years after publication, plants the nightmarish backdrop for this graphic novel in terrifyingly real and tangible terms (most glaringly, arch-conservative Margaret Thatcher's declaration that homosexuality will be relegated to the dustbin of history, even as a concept). Similar terrifying and oppressive parallels can be seen in the more virulent and extreme fundamentalist nations and movements that seek to impose Shariah law on secular democracies. The echoes of the Christian Taliban can also be clearly seen between the images.<br /><br />Split into three books, V for Vendetta begins after a nuclear war has ravaged most of Europe. Although England \\"prevails,\\" she is a mere shadow of her vibrant self, with a despotic regime stifling all dissent and making privacy impossible. Police are given sweeping powers and discretion to keep things under control. It is in this society that we meet 15-year-old Eva, forced into prostitution to survive. Rescued by the terrorist known only as V, she learns about the music and culture destroyed by the new rulers, rescued and preserved in the Shadow Gallery. With rip-roaring action, psychological terror and chills, this story is one for the generations to pass down. There are a few flaws that made portions of the comic a chore to read, most notably the forced accents of some characters. Not only did this pull me out of the book's illusion, but it made the experience considerably less enjoyable.<br /><br />Book two focuses on the consequences of an iron curtain that attempts to police thoughtcrime, and how even the most secure dictator will never receive true adoration or respect. The conclusion is among the most gripping I have ever encountered in a comic, and is well worth the effort (the mask is fun too).
B009AP2G26|5.0|I love glee! It's so cheesy and catchy and it just sucks you in. My husband makes fun of me, but the show is just great. I always catch myself smiling like an idiot or crying or tapping my foot. So talented.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting! I would have liked knowing the pictures and models were in the back of the book so when I was reading it, I could have looked back to get a better perspective on what was going down! Otherwise an awesome read!
B005OCHOZS|3.0|Mr. Jurek is an intense character! And so are the people who admire him! I read the first part of the book because a friend liked it. I urge anyone to read - or reread several times - the first page in the book, on which the author describes his agony after running 70 miles in Death Valley while contemplating running another 65 miles. Although it's an amazing achievement, common sense informs us that this kind of punishment cannot be good for the body. This caused me to wonder how many people are injured trying to run long distances. And I came across a journal article [INCIDENCE OF TRAINING-RELATED INJURIES AMONG MARATHON RUNNERS by R. J. MAUGHAN, PhD and J. D. B. MILLER, FRCS, Department of Surgery, University Department of Surgery, University Medical School, Foresterhill, ABERDEEN AB9 2ZD], available online, reporting 58 percent of the entrants in a major marathon indicated they had been injured preparing for the event. Shouldn't desirable forms of athletic activity be less injurious?
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Lady Antebellum has done it again with this CD.  I enjoy all the songs on this CD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys modern country music.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it is truly addicting. However, thoroughly annoyed that my children have a newer version on their iPods than I do on my Kindle. Come on Amazon, we're waiting!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Once I got past figuring out what all the dashes ,arrows & dots were for(no directions about those) ,I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. I especially liked the challenge of it being timed which made it a lot more fun then just being bored doing mindless matching.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|ads. Nothing more to it. everyone hates them and since it is  paid version, this is unacceptable. So, 2 stars
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I really don't understand why this movie received such poor box office reviews. The book series that spawned this movie is one of the progenitors of the science fiction genre and is over 100 years old. Are some of the concepts trite and dated? Yes, absolutely. Of course it's been done before. By the dozens of movies that were inspired by it!<br /><br />This comes from the hey-day of the space operas and other serials such as the Long Ranger, the Phantom, and Tarzan. I, for one, am happy seeing a nice piece of science fiction, not something linking me to a dystopian future that I would not wish to live in.<br /><br />The acting captures that space opera motif. The costumes are, well, cheesy. However, John Carter is kind of the Tarzan of space since they were written by the same author. Keep that in mind and allow yourself to just enjoy a nice piece of brain candy!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Epic<br />This book is as complete and well writen as any other book could hope to read, the plots and the povs are increibly well delivered and is simply a master piece.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game in the Amazon Appstore. Plus it has updates that's worth my money . I hope there is a new update
B0094K1WZE|1.0|Horrifying dialogue, an unending number of action movie cliches and cartoon physics make this one unwatchable.  If there is a God there won't be a fifth installment...
0141192453|4.0|One of my most cherished stories. The cover has a very vintage feel. I plan to buy many more from the Penguin Classics collection.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|(Spoiler free)<br />All roads have truly led to this latest installment of the Fast and The Furious series, Fast 6. Although it is somewhat lengthy, I didn't mind because the movie kept me entertained throughout the entire thing. Its a must watch for any car fan. The stunts are simply amazing, the cars are sexy as ever, and plus Michelle Rodriquez is back! Fast 7 comes out next summer, so be sure to catch this one in theaters because it brings viewera up to speed with every movie, even Tokyo Drift.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's so addicting. I love it. Everyone should try it. You'll love it. It says i have to write more than this to submit it sooooooo,yea. BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH (; Love,Laura Nicole.

B008Y2VTIS|5.0|It is easy to see why this show is such a hit...great stories, characters, and acting....we are totally addicted to it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|After reading all the great reviews and the description I'd figured I'd try The Room out and I am so glad I did! The Room is the best game I've ever played with its amazing graphics and thrilling story line. Fireproof Games has me begging for more!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|There were several discussions that I resonated with. Make me help understand why things are the way they are at work, but there were sections that I did not resonate much with either and those areas were difficult to get through. Overall, great book, I recommend for both men and women to read.
B008G59IBI|5.0|This being the third of a trilogy of CD releases is excellent in every way.  The first release UNO is really, really good, and DOS is in my opinion the best of the three.  Loved them all though and listen to them over and over.
B0070UFMOW|1.0|My Fiio E17 came last week and after four days of trying to charge it it is going back.  It works when plugged to a power supply via the supplied USB cord but on its own it doesn't turn on.  Dead internal battery or not connected inside.  Either way, this is ridiculous.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|Very fun and interesting game, looks nice and is challenging. Has ads unless you pay but that's no big deal.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|In 2009 I declared the first minute and fifty seconds of Option Paralysis' \\"I Wouldn't If You Didn't\\" The Greatest Thing Ever Committed to Tape in the History of Either Things or Tape.<br /><br />It's 2013 and that honor now belongs to the entirety of \\"Crossburner\\".<br /><br />Friends, if nothing else: we live in a moment of history where this music exists and we are here to listen to it.
0811879542|5.0|my grandchildren, especially the 3 and 5 year olds loved this book. I reread it to them many times and they still wanted more.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a great time working my way through the puzzles and objects. This is a must have for puzzle fans. Interesting store and fantastic gameplay I can only hope that next Rooms to come are just as challenging.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Had very high expectations of the book. But the book did not reach the usual depths of the characters as did the others. Felt like there were too many characters diluting the connection of the reader with the key characters.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I'm not a movie critic but I did find this movie a little boring at times especially during the scenes that try to explain Bradley cooper's traumatize past with his ex-wife. Overall funny but a bit boring.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I have listened through Discovery and TRON: Legacy.  They were both unique in its own way and there are some tracks that I have personally picked out.  On a technical level, one could disregard TRON: Legacy as a Daft Punk (henceforth to be referred to as DP) album, since it is a movie soundtrack.  Still, it is something by DP themselves.<br /><br />With several years since their previous album, Discovery, DP fans rejoiced when they hear a new album is nearing completion and release.  And the hype began from there.  It was with the \\"Get Lucky\\" song that soon got the album's hype to balloon up.  Normally, I don't like things are hyped up.  But expectations were high due to the long period between albums.<br /><br />It has taken me nearly a week to listen and truly soak in the music, which I truly wish other people would do when it comes to reviewing music.  Some melodies don't sink in nor find its mark until you listen to it a few times.<br /><br />When iTunes enabled people to stream the album for a limited time, I took the opportunity to listen to it, just to hear if DP still has that talent to compose music that is unique only to them.  And sure enough, the first track sets the tone that would be the \\"theme\\" for the album.  Yet while this theme itself is not prominent, it is there, only subtle.  The song \\"Give Life Back to Music,\\" both in melody and its lyrics, hooked me in.  Yet the reason it got me in was not because it was easy to listen to.  It was due to how it resonates with me as a listener.  When personal music players, be it iPod or smartphones, aren't available as music entertainment, one has to deal with radio.  And today's music on the radio are quite boring and bland.  But I digress so...<br /><br />Google hooked up with Giorgio Moroder for a track called Racer, the music that was played on their Racer game trailer for Google Chrome.  As I am not well versed in knowing the who's who in music, it comes as a nice melodic surprise that he'd also be featured in DP's album for \\"Giorgio by Moroder.\\"<br /><br />Restraining the urge to type/write about each individual track, I must summarize that all of the track has its individual unique charm.  Yet each of these tracks has enough melodic information to tell you that it is DP.  It took me a while to get a feel for each individual track, since some of the tracks flew over me as I played games with this album as my soundtrack.  The more I listened to the album, the more these other tracks sunk in, and begin to be recognized.<br /><br />Is there any track that I might consider as the \\"oddball\\" of them all?  That is hard to say.  Perhaps the most strangest is perhaps their final track called \\"Contact.\\"  But maybe it is due to how it was composed that it didn't click in as easily as the other tracks.<br /><br />Overall, I can comfortably say that I like this album in its entirety.  For me, this is a rare piece because I do not find any album that is worth listening to in its entirety.  On the first listen, I can easily go through it as some tracks ended up being tuned out and turned into ambiance.  Yet I cannot find a single track that I would want to skip.  Oh, and that \\"theme\\" that I referenced earlier?  Disco.  If you've heard one or two DP tracks before, then it should be worth buying, or at least worth giving its entire album a full listen.  Even if you liked maybe 3 or 4 tracks from the whole album, buy the whole thing.  Those other tracks may grow on you.  Some music are like that, requiring a few repeated listen to get a feel for it.<br /><br />Verdict: Buy the CD & rip it yourself.ed in DP's album for \\"Giorgio by Moroder.\\"<br /><br />Restraining the urge to type/write about each individual track, I must summarize that all of the track has its individual unique charm.

B002RHGYOA|5.0|Gripping, did not want to put it down...Such a talented writer.. I have immediately started the next instalment. Totally hooked.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|the song Paradise that an African Gentleman sings is incredible!<br />the music is soft and beautiful. Can't wait until they release there next cd.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|With a cancer in family history I was always interested about the different less aggressive treatments with less side effect. The Gerson therapy is something which I would consider doing myself even as prevention and the book is great to explain this method.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I liked it specially the Paradise song which to me was the best of this cd<br />I do recommend it
B00571F26Y|3.0|I understand what the author says...makes sense...but...<br />I found as I got to the end...it was waaaaaay too restrictive. I was ok with wheat being altered through the hybridization process over the years etc, and cutting that out of my diet, but I thought in the end, he cut ALL grains out of the diet...for all practical purposes, saying only 1/4 cup per day?<br />I guess &#34;everything in moderation&#34; including radical diet-change books.  I think if you have a serious health problem and have literally tried everything and have nothing left to lose, except your colon...as in one case he sites in the book...then go for it.  But if you are a post-menopausal woman with a spare tire like me...you can try some of his suggestions..or just the Atkins Diet.<br />Gotta run...my whole-grain bagel is done...
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Never would upload correctly ~ just kept stalling and would never even let me play the game. Very disappointed in this game!
B0093OGBL6|4.0|This book is an important read for those who seek to really understand the essence of Michael Jackson. If you were not a fan before, you will be after reading this book.<br />That said, I struggled to finish reading this book, as I did not particularly like how the book was structured. It was also too repetitive  in places. I think you can get past this however, and allow yourself to truly understand Michael Jackson, the man.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My girls & I play this game together seeing who can beat who's score. Great way to pass the time when you only have a few minutes to spare.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Dungeon hunter 4 is a fun and easy to learn game. The graphics are great ,the diffrent weapons, armor and spells make replay extremely exciteing.
0142412147|2.0|Okay, I liked this book....I just didn't love it. And I wanted too! I love Christmas and it's my favorite holiday, but these three books kinda fell flat for me. I know summer's around the corner and I'm reading a Christmas book, and I liked that this had a lot of the Christmas feeling in it, but the stories themselves? Eh...<br />The stories didn't seem to have a lot of development. I wished they could have been made a little longer so that more could happen. I also felt that in each book it was drawn out to the last possible second, and then completely rushed together at the very end. Although I did like how all three were somehow semi-connected which I did not realize when I started.<br />They were cute stories, and I'll probably read this again during Winter Break sometime, but it wouldn't be the first Christmas book I'd go for. I think they would have been better as a series where all three co-wrote the books because I really think the books were extremely limited. A lot more could have happened!<br />Also, I dont' want to say too much about the books' plots since they do sort of cross over to one and other, especially the last one.<br />I would recommend this, and I gave it four stars on Goodreads but I definitely felt it could have been a lot better and maybe with more effort? I love all three of these authors so it seemed sort of a let-down to have such a mediocre book, but that's just my opinion! Check it out for yourself and see what you think!<br />http://www.thepaige-turner.com/2012/05/let-it-snow-three-holiday-romances-by.html
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is awesome. everyone should read it. It talks about the toltec way of life and how we can inprove ours by following some simple rules .
1451696191|5.0|Honestly, everyone and their mother has done a review of this book. Just go read it. Please, right now, do it. After I finished reading it (during which I laughed and cried) I wrote down a list of things I was feeling so I could better explain how I felt once I was finished. I knew it would be a week or so before I wrote this review so this is what I felt a week ago:<br /><br />Happy<br />Sad<br />Disbelief<br />Humbled<br />Content<br />Out of body<br />Melancholy<br />Wise<br />Perceptive<br />Then, I decided to reread it and I started noticing that it had some really, really good quotes, but it was definitely better during the first read through. Maybe because I started noticing more things and maybe because after the first reading of any book you're kind of let down by reading it again immediately afterwards. I definitely need to come back to this again in a few months.<br />But seriously, go read it. I know people who never ever read and they loved this book so please take the time to go read it. Also, if anyone has seen the movie and they enjoyed it, or hated it, or felt it was/was not close to the book please let me know! I still need to see it and would like a few opinions!<br />http://www.thepaige-turner.com/2013/05/the-perks-of-being-wallflower-by.html
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|Sean Penn does it again with a great performance. There are some really funny quotes that you'll enjoy repeating.<br />You'll enjoy it.
1594744769|5.0|Wow this book creeped me out. But in a good way! Sometimes I would be reading this at night and I'd have to set it down and burrow deeper under the covers because it would make me feel a little safer. No book has really creeped me out like this so it was cool to read a book like that.<br />I absolutely loved the incorporation of pictures along with the text. It made the story seem so much more real and gave more depth to the story. The pictures themselves also thoroughly creeped me out and sometimes I would have to cover them while reading an adjoining page because the looks in some of their eyes scared me. The scare factor definitely upped the rating on this book for me, it just made it that much better.<br />Anyways, the main character Jacob sets out on an adventure to find Miss Peregrine and her home of peculiar children after his grandfather dies in an extremely mysterious and suspicious way. The authorities chalk it up as rabid animals but Jacob knows that something else is going on because he saw them. The monsters.<br />Jacob finds the house on a lonely, tiny, island and all hopes seems to be lost as he travels through the ruined house that has been eaten away by animals, and overgrown by nature with trees and plants growing straight through the house. However, by a slight chance Jacob may be able to meet the peculiar children who once lived here after all.<br />This book is so hard to put down into words! It's so amazing, and quirky (and I think there might be a sequel...) There's definitely nothing else like this book; meaning, it's not too often that you see a young adult picture book. Nevertheless, this just shows that more authors should break the status quo and try something new because the pictures worked really really well! They didn't overpower the book, because the plot could definitely stand on its own without the pictures but it just added the extra creepy element to the story.<br />If there is a second book, then I cannot wait to get my hands onit because I'd expect it to be just as fantastic as this one!<br />http://www.thepaige-turner.com/2013/01/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar.html
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Awesome CD,  not a bad song on it.  Zac Brown Band is the band to see this summer.  Everything this man touches turns to gold.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great fast paced read. Alternating points of view made this a fast read. You grow to dislike yet respect both Amy and Nick. Clearly not a basic story. Original from start to finish.
B007MDB71O|5.0|We took our boys to see this movie in the theater and loved it too much! Great story line, good acting, wonderful action, adventure and creativity.  We could not wait to buy the DVD when it came out.  Critically this movie got beat up unfairly.  I hope it will develop a fanbase like Firefly where more and more people will discover what a fun and well done performance is put on by all those in the film.  Hope to see more John Carter adventures in the future!
B001TH16DI|4.0|It's true that the even numbered movies are better than the odd numbered ones, with the 2nd one, THE WRATH OF KHAN, being the best (and one of my all-time favorite movies). That doesn't mean that the odd numbered ones are bad, though... well... the 5th one is rough (thought it seems to have influenced J.J. Abrams' reboots -- at least the love of lens flares.)<br /><br />1 is overall boring and ponderous, though the characters bring it to life in spots. 2, 3, and 4 create a very cool trilogy that is the heart of this series. 5 has good ideas but is a cheap-looking misfire. 6 is a great return to form and a nice send off for the original cast.<br /><br />All the movies look great, except for 5, which is oddly blurry and dull considering they were all given the high def treatment for blu-ray. Maybe it's just the way it was shot?<br /><br />The extras are amazing, the movies are fun, and if you like STAR TREK at all, I highly recommend this set.
B003GIW8JE|5.0|I've always loved this album ever since it was released.  It was Uriah Heep's only really big US hit.  Part of my continued fondness is the fact that the band's lead singer/keyboardist, Ken Hensley, has been living here in St. Louis for many years.  As to the re-issue:  the remastering is pristine, and most of the added tracks are a nice addition.  By the way, if you are a purist and believe the original is perfect and should not be added to:  the original version is also available.  Given that, is an alternate version of \\"Rainbow Demon\\"really necessary?  It's up to the listener to decide.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|A great tutorial with excellent breakdowns of common faults. Easy to read and follow, with great visual references. A must have for any coach, as the rudimentary topics have universal applications.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is the most like the old games I had on my first Kindle.  Those games were not transferred when I got my new Kindlefire H.D.  I have been looking for something similar and now I have found it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Why oh why did this show ever get cancelled!!!  Good storyline and cast, frustrating that there is only one season.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Loved the twists and touches of historical references. Characters developed well. If reader is a Downtown Abbey fan, this is a must read.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Good film.  Deserved much more of an audience than it got after Disney's lousy marketing effort.  This story was the the grandfather of a lot of modern sci-fi and movie makers like George Lucas were inspired by these stories when making Star Wars.  I believe a sequel, if properly marketed, could be a success.
B008I43DYU|5.0|So far,  I really love the calculator on my kindle.  The numbers are big and clear.  There is no question as to what numbers are on the screen, as they are highly visible and very easy to read.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|This movie was quite intriguing, and profound. Wrestles with the possibility of a creator and the desires, the fate, and the destiny that every human being place a part in.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this series, I have read it 3 times, it never gets old. There is a lot of fantasy loaded in this book. Great for I proving your sex life.
B003E20ZQA|5.0|This is a book to be savored.<br /><br />Frankly, I often can't stand memoirs by artists or performers.  To me, they often come across as pretentious or inauthentic.  Not this book.<br /><br />Patti Smith comes across as a deeply wise and compassionate woman with a gift for storytelling.  She brings to life the complex world of the New York vie boheme from the late 60s on, as well as her life with Robert Mapplethorpe, whose later work caused so much controversy in the 1980s.<br /><br />This review can't do the book justice.  I highly recommend you read the book yourself.  You'll feel you travelled to another place and time with the best of guides.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I'm not a trekkie by any means, but I absolutely loved this movie.  Saw it in the theaters when it came out, and recently re-watched it to prep myself for the sequel.  Just an all-around great movie.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Brings history to life in a way that books never could! Terrific, sexy, dramatic! Carries you along so that you feel for the characters.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book really helps to she'd a light on the practices of the food industry and helps to explain why junk food is as awful for us as it is. This isn't a book that vilifies the food industry but rather show us that they're catering to the wants and desires of the public and that if we want the food options in the grocery store to improve it's our job to show them through what we buy that they need to make a change.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I've had the pleasure to read. It's long but I can't imagine how it could leave anything out
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best of George Martin's books thus far!  Suspenseful through out the entire book.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|First of all, I think it's important to say that this movie will not be for everyone. You will either stick with it and enjoy this experience, or you will grow bored and not even finish it.<br /><br />I've seen many comments about how the movie doesn't make sense or that the \\"College Educated\\" viewer was lost in what the movie was even about.<br />You do not need a Psych, Lit. or any other higher Ed degree to get this movie. It might even be fair to say the lesson and message of this movie is something that can not be taught from a book.<br /><br />It's a quite simple concept really.  Its about re-incarnation and Karma.  How every act ripples through time and molds us in the future,past,and present. Its about how evil men can very well change. How a seemingly insignificant act of kindness can and does matter.<br /><br />The thing about this movie is that, at 3hrs long, it really does not really get on its feet until about 1 1/2 - 2hrs in. But that last hour or hour and a half is an experience.<br /><br />In short, this is a excellent movie for those who stick with it to the end. But as mentioned before, its also a love it/hate it type movie.<br />You'll either \\"Get it\\" or you won't.<br /><br />There is alot of jumping around in time periods. In a sense, it's like several smaller movies all in one. (Though that's not really a good way to put it)  One minute your watching a story in 2012, the next your in the 1977, then in the future. It bounces back and forth like this thorough the entire movie, and may be confusing at first.  But once you get a grip on whats going on in each era, it really starts coming together as its about each persons different reincarnations.<br /><br />In my view, the entire movie is really about the distant future.<br />The decisions that each made in past lives, which has molded them into the person they have become. And why they are motivated to do as they do, even though they may not quite realize how everything before has changed them intothe person they are today.<br /><br />Its a slow burn, but an experience worth experiencing :)  5 stars from me!
B008J05EL8|4.0|Bought this font package for my Acer tablet. Works just fine for when I'm on the road. Good value for the $$
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|I haven't quite got this one mastered yet.  If you like Tetris you would probably like this one except the rules are different as to where you can put the blocks.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|The CD is in a good shape,  few scratches, but wont complain. The beat sounds amazing! I will recommend this CD to everybody.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lots of weapons talk and military jargon. No sex. Little profanity. Just blood, shooting and anticipation. If you like action and a larger than life unconventional hero, this is it.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Plasma Sky is a retro-style shooter very similar to Galaga if I'm not mistaken. Your ship has automatic rapid fire. All you need is to maneuver your ship around and destroy the enemy and pick up ejected fuel cells. The colors, sounds and game play are great - I feel young and at the arcade again! Fantastic!
B00138KJY0|5.0|Classic Michael, can't miss with this...the songs are timeless, this was a awesome purchase..I'm so happy I took the time time to revisit this album
B00821OX98|5.0|It's not Justified or Sons of Anarchy, but it's fun and an easy entertainment. Enjoyed it very much and look forward to the next season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down, an absolutely great book!  Lots of suspense through out the whole book. Can't wait to read the next one!

1468179993|4.0|Despite its title, the central point here is not to teach you how to \\"pass the bar\\" for a TED presentation, but rather, to teach the basics of effective communication - you don't have to be on a TED stage to practice this advice. The real power of the TED talk is precisely because it is concise (5-15 minutes), and forces the speaker to distill their points to their essence, instead of the usual hour-long (or worse) monologue. With that in mind, how do you pick a topic, craft an effective catch phrase, structure your transitions, and deliver an effective ending? Jeremey Donovan provides short and helpful tips to each of these questions.<br /><br />If there is only one missing piece of advice: it's all about the content. Presentation form, structure, and presentation absolutely matters, but unless you have a clear message, and stay on point (have a 60 minute presentation, try reducing it to 10 minutes!), you won't get far. Unfortunately, it is all too easy to get distracted on the form, instead of working on the content.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This was a fun series.  It is sad to see it ending and it had somewhat of a sad ending.  It was fun while it lasted.
0385349947|5.0|Perhaps this should not surprise me, but there are very few male reviewers commenting on the book. Let's just hope this is not representative of the larger readership, as the book delivers a lot of important insights for both genders. In fact, as Sheryl Sandberg points out, while there are definitely (and sadly) many cases of double standards and \\"cultural norms\\" which put women at a (professional) disadvantage, just as likely, many of these situations are simply due to lack of awareness one one side, and willingness to raise the objection on the other - the \\"expecting mother parking\\", or lack of thereof, story shared from her Google days, followed by a \\"yes, of course, we should absolutely do that\\" illustrates the point well. Perhaps a trivial example, but nonetheless a great one, exactly because it is so trivial and yet non-obvious and uncommon to see in practice.<br /><br />An educational read, and one worth recommending to your male and female colleagues alike.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Made me understand that no matter what your reciprocity style currently or previously was the giver style is the one to strive for. Not only for others benefit but for your own as well!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is very simple, but at least it works well. Not a bit confusing at all! This calcutator is great if you want to do basic operations.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved all the tricks and puzzles I want another game and I want it to be harder. It sucks you in and makes you want to play.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I've been looking for a good page turner for awhile and finally found it with The Kitchen House. The book does not glamorize plantation life for either slaves or women of the time. However, the author truly makes you care about the characters and she does a wonderful job bringing them to life. This book is definitely worth the read!
B00CW665VI|4.0|I'm impressed by this whole book was worried for a minute but it was really good. It is a must read.
B002LQCNFQ|4.0|After buying the first two Doors albums when they came out, I skipped this one when it was released. In 1970 I picked up Absolutely Live and from then on, I was a hardcore Doors Fan for life. I didn't revisit this studio album until recently. Probably my least favorite song is Hello, I Love you. Its not the Doors fault! It was beat to death on AM radio. Love Street reminds me of Venice, where I grew up in the 60's. Not to Touch the Earth is a  great clip of Celebration of the Lizard but is stronger in the complete opus. The Unknown Soldier, Spanish Caravan and Five to One are all strong. The biggest surprise on the album was My Wild Love.  It's classic Morrison and the only time I had heard it was in Oliver Stones Doors Movie. With the death of Ray Manzarek this week, I reflected on how lucky we were to have these four talented musicians share themselves with us for a brief time.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|I am surprise that the movie did not get a better review.  Its funny with lots of action, lots of bullets and tricks and strategy.
B0064Y3RHY|4.0|Of the disco era albums, I like this one the best because it reminds me the least of that time period and more of the early 70's offerings. Squeezing the Studio 54 influence out of the Stones would require the Death to Disco movement. Fortunately, Keith Richards has always been a hardcore blues man and for that I will always be grateful.  All Stones albums some have good cuts and some Stones albums are just solidly great. This one is closer to the latter.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Honest\\". I am surprise that the movie did not get a better review. Its funny with lots of action, lots of bullets and tricks and strategy.
B0031R5K68|5.0|This book kept me reading for long moments. One evening I though started to read at 11pm and thought I would read maybe 30 minutes. Suddenly I noticed it was 2 am... I can certainly recommend this book to anyone with intrest to symbols, science or a bit mysterious stories.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I first saw Monsters Inc. with my girlfriend in 2001 and we loved the humor and creativity behind the story line. Now that she is my wife I loved watching this with my oldest daughter all the more.<br /><br />We rented this in anticipation of the prequel Monsters U. I have a very excited little girl after watching the original.
B008ROGQAE|1.0|I have a Samsung TV and using the Amazon app in the last month makes everything unwatchable, the constant buffering.  The show is great, Amazon's stream service is not, at least on the Samsung.  If you have a Samsung TV, streaming doesn't seem to be very reliable right now. (May 2013)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never played any games online before but the cover was so mysterious and intriguing I decided to give it a try. It was amazing!  I couldn't put it down. I hope they come out with another one.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Glu has a definite hit on their hands!  I have had a blast with this game!  I will add more to this review when I get to my laptop...I'm not a fan of touch screen keyboards for long text entries.  Just a quick - you can beat the main 50-levels without buying Flu credits!  I might just get some to say thanks for such a great game!
B001RUXW48|5.0|DiCaprio and Crowe do an outstanding job depicting the current clandestine global war on terror. Filmed in large part in Morocco in the medina quarter with walled, narrow, maze-like streets added to the intrigue. The film examines the tensions between Western and Arab societies and the effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have been wanting to read a Jack Reacher book before I saw this movie. With my son home for Memorial Day weekend, wanted to watch something he was sure to enjoy, so we chose this film. We both enjoyed it. What's great about movies based upon books, they usually have more depth, twists and nuances because you are packing a 300 page book into a 90 minute or so movie.<br /><br />There's usually great back story. In this movie, there's a multiple shooting with plenty of clues pointing to a killer with a past. However, are the clues too obvious? And why does Jack Reacher suddenly show up? And why isn't he wanted on the scene? Who is trying to run him out of town and why?<br /><br />The plot thickens.<br /><br />The actors were well-cast. While I can understand readers' disappointment that the Reacher actor wasn't 6'5, blonde and chiseled, Tom Cruise carried off the role of Jack Reacher. I found him believable. Loved Robert Duval as owner of a gun range - he was my history professor's college room mate, so always enjoy seeing him. Rosemund Pike, as the attorney for the accused, is an actress I would like to see in more films. The other actors seemed well-suited for their roles.<br /><br />The story held our interest, seemed fresh and original and we were glad we watched it. The script is entertaining - Jack had some zingers. Hope there is a sequel to this movie from another of the Jack Reacher books.
0446310786|5.0|I don't know how I missed reading Harper Lee's classic when I was in school, but I decided to make up for that deficiency. The story told through the wise/naïve eyes of young Scout is enchanting. I read the book in two days. It paints an engaging picture of a small southern town in the mid-20th century. The racial incident, while most pertinent when it was written, is not as far distant a memory as we might hope. Its story is brutal and heartbreaking and completely believable in the southern community Lee has created.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|As a former personal trainer I believe this book should be given to all trainers who are helping clients build muscle mass while reducing body fat at the same time. This book offers easy to follow and understand guidelines for achieving the physique you dream of having.<br />I strongly suggest you also download the free One Year Challenge that Amazon includes with the book purchase for detailed step by step instructions on putting the principles described in the book into action as the author intended and does himself.<br />After following this plan for only 5 weeks, I have already lost 13 lbs of body fat while continuing to build muscle mass and strength at 47 years old. By following the program (diet, exercises, supplements, and rest) I feel like I'm physically in my 20's again.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Very educational and interesting story! It is based on a true story that should be told.  Very happy with purchase.
1932100660|4.0|I am 81 years old and not about to change my diet . But if I were younger and wanted to better my health and extend my life span,<br />I'd do what this book says. It is 100% credible!
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book basically says you have to work hard to get good at anything, but it says it in a nice way
0252069218|5.0|A previous reviewer was wrong when he said there are no introductions or notes in this book.  This book has extensive notes, references and introductions by Mabbott (one of the most highly regarded Poe scholars ever to live).  His notes, comments, and references pull together a range of esoteric sources and back-story behind Poe's work that is almost incredible.  I highly recommend all three of Mabbott's books on Poe.  The biographical sketch of Poe included in this volume is exceedingly useful as it can be read quickly and referenced easily for quick review when trying to remember the sequence of major events in Poe's life.  Mabbott makes clear much that is confusing to modern readers when tackling Poe's place in antebellum America.  Poe revised many of his works numerous times and Mabbott's selection of which version of each story should be considered the standard has basically been universally adopted by scholars.  Also this particular printing is remarkably free of errors.  I will say however that Mabbott was not correct in every aspect (he's only human though).  For example, in his commentary on Ulalume he asserts that the setting of the poem is Halloween night.  There is no actual evidence for this in the poem.  The \\"night of all nights in the year\\" is not Halloween as he asserts, rather it becomes obvious to the reader by the end of the poem that that line is mere foreshadowing of the fact that it is the one year anniversary of the burial of Ulalume.  Regardless, if you can only buy one collection of Poe's work, then the only good option is Mabbott!  You won't regret it.  However, if you go that distance, then you will also want to consider getting Burton Pollin's works on Poe also for a more complete understanding of Poe and his written corpus.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This series has taught me quite a bit about Greek mythology . I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Awesome movie about social status and the love that overcomes those boundaries. Excellent film! Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen have a magic chemistry!! One of my favorites!!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I love Cirque Du Soleil. You must approach each show differently and with an open mind. Expecting Nothing .. Receiving everything.<br />This film is phenomenal, breath taking and mesmerizing.<br />They seem to have taken some of the best parts from many of their shows and woven them together around a couple that \\"destiny\\" brings together, only to be separated. The movie entails the journey each experiences along on the path of finding one another again.<br />If you have never experienced a LIVE performance, this Cirque Du Soleil Movie in 3-D is as close as you will get.<br />It will set your senses on edge to watch the abilities of each Cirque Du Soleil performer, while admiring their strength, agility, concentration and total control of their bodies...making each move look effortless and relaxing. You will find yourself holding your breath during several scenes.<br />The CD is well worth the price when you consider WHAT it costs for a ticket to a live performance..IF you can get a ticket. Buy it and Enjoy. Children will love it. It's like taking them to the Circus.<br />I gave it a well deserved 5 Stars when it really should have 10!
B000OR6NU0|4.0|It was very good I only want the album for the cover and it was in good shape for as old as it was. I was happy
B0063IH60K|5.0|A lot of fun .... One can back up your play and replay other cards.  It gives you an opportunity to win every time. It is addicting and helps with rational thinking exercises.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|I am a fan of the Jack Reacher books and this movie just did not do justice to Lee Child or Jack Reacher.  Totally miscast - Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher who is supposed to be a giant of a man and intimidating at first glance.  Tom is neither and was just not credible.  The writing was not up to Lee Child quality, the villans were lame, the chase scene was lame and contrived, nothing worked.  very disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphic. My little girl is loving taking care of her own horse. Lots of fun mini games to play to keep your horse happy.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good story line. I liked the look of the graphics. It was fun to play and was engaging. I liked the main character.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE. MAYBE BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE. IT HAD THE FEEL OF STAR TREK 2 WRATH OF KHAN BUT WITH MORE ACTION. IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I thought the game was full of riddles and horror. I was very impressed with all of the detail and complexity.<br />Loved this game can't Wait for the second one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Every now and then you read a book you can't stop thinking about and this is one of them. It is about a young woman who is desperate for a job and takes the only one she can get - caring for a man who had had it all until he became quadriplegic when hit by a motorcycle. Their relationship and how it develops ( and ends) will leave you thinking about life, love, and what really matters for a long time.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Great music for good times! You make this too hard. If you want my review, be happy with what I write...
B0091X8FUE|5.0|One of my favorite in the series! It is absolutely worth purchasing in HD quality.  I can watch this over and over!

0788772015|5.0|Discovering Patrick O'Brian's story is a landmark event. Anyone who appreciates good writing and characterizations (yes, even if the idea of reading about naval life in the era of the Napoleonic wars sounds appalling!) is almost certainly going to fall in love with this series.  And hearing the story read by Patrick Tull is the best.  There are other good readers on other audiobook versions, but Patrick Tull found and brought to us subtleties of meaning and feeling that even sensitive readers are likely to have missed.  This is a great treasure, and I dearly hope someone will re-issue it on CD's.  Obviously there are not enough copies around.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This was an impuse purchase, and I am so glad to have done it. There are 4 Dragons to choose from with many levels in each dragon choice. You can choose kiddie, easy and two more levels, each getting more difficult to solve. I like have 3 hints available per game and the automatic shuffle when no more matches are playable. Make it as fast-paced as you'd like, but the goal is to do it quickly enough to get all three stars to move on to the next level. Of course you can go slower and get one or two stars filled upon completion as well. I like the diversity of the play. Many, many configurations to play! If you are a mahjong lover, at whatever skill level, then this game is for you!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Author has come up with a new character. CID Warrant Officer with an interesting family background. Well paced action packed thriller. Baldacci keeps churning them out with varying degrees of quality. This one is one of his better efforts. Expect to see more of this protagonist, and I'll be a buyer.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Somewhat prolonged and at times repeating story... I enjoyed discovering an unexpected twist and a almost a happy ending...  Despite the ending I found it hard to gauge whether the characters involved had truly moved on...
B007R41E8O|1.0|I have been unable to get this installed.  after downloading it required a 350mb update and moves very slowly.  I have been trying to get the update installed over wifi for days and it is not even half way done.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|The description says &#34;other cell phones&#34; but realistically if your phone is even slightly bigger than the iphone the tripod wont hold it. its a poor design and there are better ones out there for similar price. 2 stars because i can serve a purpose if you have a smaller phone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a quick game to play when I only have a few minutes to play a game.  If you like Solitare you will like this.

B008476HBM|2.0|I read even less of this book.  S&S was easier to read than this.  The style of writing was confusing and boring and hard to follow.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a good game but there is a end to the world like what I mean is our go one direction it will come to the end of the map..... also for multiplayer there needs to be internet multiplayer not WiFi multiplayer and there need to be a bucket
B007SXB498|3.0|I did not read the entire book.  It was hard for me to get into.  It was so wordy and didn't read smooth for me.  I heard it was a great book so I decided to read but, it was slow and kind of boring.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this product. It works well and has not seemed like it will break any time soon. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a nice, working case for their Kindle Fire. It is at an excellent price, and is better than the last case I purchased. If you're trying to choose between Kindle Fire cases, you should definitely choose this one!

B000YKE87W|5.0|Currently more discussed for his fantastic way with Wagner's tenor roles, Kaufmann shows on this disc that he can be equally impressive in especially the French repertoire.  Impeccable attention to detail and beautiful tone....listen to the Massenet &#34;Manon&#34;<br />and &#34;Werther&#34; selections for proof.  Highly recommended, but get the Wagner disc as well!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked the book. I look forward to reading more from this author. She has an interesting way of telling a story.

0060873175|1.0|I'm a huge Crichton fan, but when I have to rewrite the dialogue in my head as I go, just to be able to continue reading, it's not a Crichton novel. It's awkward and choppy, the entire book comprised of characters repeating key \\"plot points\\" as though we might have missed them the first time they were brought up out of context--just truly awful. No hooks, no delicate nuances, no context...<br />I never thought I'd say this of a book, but Twilight would be a better read by FAR, and that's just disappointing. Maybe I'll take the time and rewrite this how it should have been written, apparently you can get away with trash and still be taken seriously so the bar isn't that high.<br />I'm sure I'd love Preston's nonfiction, but I've no idea why anyone thought to let him write this alone, it clearly needs an editor. Come to think--did ANYone edit this? I'm doubtful.

B00006AW2P|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest example of British 60's R&B. It has grteat tunes and is faithfull to the original riffs which were pretty good in the first place. The versions of Carol, Walking the Dog are too much and for my ears their rendition of Route 66 tops all others!<br />How about that?
1582701709|5.0|There are days we all have them, life seems dark and dreary- on those days I pick up The Secret, and it lifts me up from the funk.
078322611X|5.0|This movie was a extraordinary treat - thoroughly enjoyable ; inspiring ; thought provoking ; informative ; and ,outstanding acting throughout.<br /><br />This is one of the handful movies that we will view time , time , time , and again !!!<br /><br />Hopefully , our government history re-writers will not decide it does not fit into their view of what should constitute &#34;proper&#34; American history.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Based on this movie, I guess we can all look forward to a future with awesome technology controlled by people even more ignorant and arrogant than we have today. It amazes me that so much time and money can go into making a film, and still the finished product contains a host of bad ideas, poor direction, and inconsistent characters. The story is primarily populated with a collection of \\"scientists\\" who are all deeply unstable and emotionally overwrought. On a planet 2 billion light years from earth, they take one ridiculous risk after another - ignoring all standards of \\"science\\". But I guess that makes sense, because the film seems to have a religious message to push as well. There are several references to \\"intelligent design\\" and the only surviving character wears a cross (which she is overly concerned about) and uses phrases like \\"the year of our lord\\". Please. Next time save the preaching and make a smart movie.
B008B1VYP0|1.0|I like the clean version of these songs, but the explicit version is HORRIBLE!  Why so vulgar Adam?  We didn't notice when we purchased this that we were getting the explicit version.  I wish we could return it for the clean version.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|solutions are too costly in points vs. points earned.  You earn 1 point per level  but the solution of the difficult levels is 4-7 points so far.  It does however give you multiple chances to solve on your own.

B0087IT8LO|5.0|A global crowd pleaser to be sure, this based-on-real-events story avoids the clutches of emotional manipulation which would have been its downfall.  Instead, the two primary characters mesh their cultural differences into an upbeat story of life and its challenges.<br /><br />Phillippe (Francois Cluzet) is a wealthy quadriplegic, injured in a hang gliding accident.  He and his attractive secretary (Audrey Fleurot) are interviewing men who will aid Phillippe with dressing, bathing and other hygiene concerns.  Among the interviewees is Driss (Omar Sy) who immigrated to France from Senegal as a boy.  Driss has grown up on the streets and is a small time hoodlum whose mother has kicked him out of their crowded apartment.<br /><br />Driss has no intention of getting the job, but needs a signature saying he was there so that he can get his unemployment check.  Surprisingly, Phillippe likes the guy's smart ass attitude and he's hired.  At this point, there is no question where this will head but the journey is a good one.<br /><br />Phillippe gets a renewed sense of adventure as Driss drives his boss's Maserati dangerously through the Parisian streets.  And then Driss sets Phillippe up on a date with an unseen correspondent.  Driss is introduced to the fine arts of classical music, opera and painting.  As their worlds collide they are also expanded in different directions.  Written and directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, the film is beautifully photographed and acted with joy and warmth.  An excellent supporting cast headed by Anne Le Ny as Phillippes household manager contributes to his charming film.  One of the best of 2012.<br /><br />I'm pleasantly surprised at the excellent quality of this Blu Ray transfer which come in 1080p resolution with an original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  In a nutshell the film is beautiful to watch.  It is rare that I pay much attention to the detail of clothing and accessories, but this transfers makes patterns pop off suits and jackets.  The colors are perfect and the clarity is first rate throughout.  Remarkable stuff.  I'm equally impressed by the care taken with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio option.  Again surprising for an indi movie that relies primarily on dialog.  Music is central to the story however as Driss is a big fan of Earth Wind and Fire and other dance music from America.  Phillippe is a fan of classical and often has small orchestras perform at his home.  There is a funny scene at the opera.  So yes, there is plenty of music and it is well represented in the audio.  Excellent package which makes the film a great one to own.  The only thing missing are extras for those who are looking for them.  Just some deleted scenes and the usual handful of trailers.ets.

B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This movie started slow but pocked up in he middle and ended with a twist. I would recommend this to family and friends.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who is considering writing or an admirer of Mr. King.  While the premise is to provide guidance to aspiring writers, much of the book gives you a designed look at both what brought Mr. King to writing and what inspires him.  When you finish reading, you'll feel as if you had the opportunity to interview your favorite author.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was hooked from the beginning. It was one of those books that threw unexpected story lines into the mix and it made it more interesting. I definitely enjoyed the book and would recommend it to a friend.

So, I sat down with my family, put the bluray 3d disc in the player, and sat down eagerly awaiting to watch it. But guess what? I COULDN'T!!!!! As soon as the film started, several thick green lines appeared on the screen! I don't know why it happened as it has not happened with any of my other films so it couldn't be a problem with the player or the tv. But whatever it was it prevented me and my family from watching this long awaited 3d version of a spectacular film! Any help on this? :(
