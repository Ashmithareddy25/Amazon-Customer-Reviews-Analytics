B000OVLBF8|4.0|Wanting to see Ghost Rider 2, I realized I had never seen the first one. I obtained this new copy at my W-Mart $5.00 bin. I liked the sound track which includes the fine classic rock Satanic songs of Ozzy, ZZ, and the Carpenters. Cage sells his soul to the devil, former Easy Rider Peter Fonda and becomes his bounty hunter in the form of Ghost Rider. The movie is rather boring until we get the transformation, although it tries to keep us entertained.<br /><br />The highlight for me was the interview Eva Mendes conducts with a punk girl who describes Ghost Rider. \\"His head was all like in flames...but he made it look good.\\"<br />Sam Elliot ensures the picture will remain a cult classic.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. I am looking forward to the sequel.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|When movie magic is at its best, the viewer is immersed in the story, and believes everything portrayed on the screen.  Case in point:  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, Peter Weir's epic depiction of life at sea in the early 19th Century.  Here we find gritty authenticity where absolutely nothing is spared, from the suffocating stench of below decks, to the mirth and mayhem of the ship's officers dining together, to the brutality of hand-to-hand combat as one ship overtakes another.  It's all as believable as it is spellbinding, as we follow HMS 'Surprise' as it plays a cat-and-mouse game across two oceans with a vastly superior French frigate.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is the headliner playing Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, a most approachable commander with a winning disposition paired with astonishing resolution; Captain Aubrey is going to take the French ship, dire consequences or no.  This often puts him at odds with the ship's surgeon and Jack's personal friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany); Maturin serves as a sort of barometer for the crew, and is allowed to be upfront and frank with the captain.  These exchanges create remarkable tension, as both men have unwavering mutual respect.  Meanwhile we're privy to the ongoing adventures of the 'Surprise' as it sails the Atlantic, rounds the Cape of South America, and heads into the immense waters of the Pacific; from battle to meatball surgery to topsails to camaraderie to rigid discipline to the sailors' infatuation with superstition.  The cast playing the crew is stellar, including Billy Boyd (who will always be known to me as Pippin).  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is an engrossing and enchanting tale, enthusiastically recommended for all movie buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all the games on this app. tons of fun! keeps us occupied. for hours ! love it!  my boys love it too
B00005O5CM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! I thought it was really hilarious and Resse Witherspoon played a great part in this movie. Nobody could have done it better than her! It definitely has you laughing from beginning to end and rooting for Elle every step of the way. It is definitely a movie I can watch over and over again!

My fiance, who has an iPhone 4, is even more addicted to it than I am and said it was better than his favorite iPhone games. He finally downloaded it on his phone after playing it on my Fire all the time. Great game.

0307591549|4.0|Up until the late nineties psychology was overly focused on the \\"sickness model\\" and treating mental illness. In \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" Shawn points out \\"as late as 1998, there was a 17-to-1 negative-to-positive ratio of research in the field of psychology. In other words, for every one study about happiness and thriving there were 17 studies on depression and disorder.\\" The shift from sickness to wellness in the past 10 years has been dramatic. Search Amazon for books on happiness and you'll find over 22,000!<br /><br />I am torn on how to review and rate this book. I was originally drawn to the book by its sub-title, \\"The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology that Fuel Success and Performance at Work.\\" I am constantly looking for evidence of how \\"soft skills\\" produce hard results. As in my book, [[ASIN:0968467512 The Leader's Digest: Timeless Principles for Team and Organization Success]] we use this in our retreats and workshops to go through the heads of \\"hard-nosed and results-focused\\" operational executives and managers to get at issues of the heart.<br /><br />\\"The Happiness Advantage\\" does have a fair bit of strong research showing the positive impact of employee happiness/satisfaction on organizational results. For example, Shawn produces powerful evidence that social support and nurturing relationships are major happiness factors. This is followed by an MIT study where researchers followed 2,600 employees at IBM for a year and showed that people with the strongest social connections had the highest performance. He also cites research showing that it takes a ratio of 2.9013 to 1 positive to negative interactions to make a team successful. A ratio of 6 - 1 creates optimum teamwork. When a global mining company was coached to increase their ratio from 1.15 to 3.56 positive to negative interactions production and performance increased by 40%!!<br /><br />However, \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" is primarily aimed at increasing personal happiness. With Shawn's conversational writing style, solid research base, and plenty of engaging examples (such as his years helping his students at Harvard increase their happiness) the book is very useful. The Seven Principles form the book's core chapters and is a good framework:<br /><br />The Happiness Advantage - retrain our brains to capitalize on positivity and improve productivity and performance.<br /><br />The Fulcrum and the Lever - adjust our mindset (fulcrum) to give us the power (lever) to be more fulfilled and satisfied.<br /><br />The Tetris Effect - spot patterns of possibility to see and seize opportunities wherever we look.<br /><br />Falling Up - finding the mental path that leads up and out of failure and teaches us how to be happier and more successful from it.<br /><br />The Zorro Circle - regain emotional control when overwhelmed by challenges by focusing on small manageable goals and gradually expanding our circle.<br /><br />The 20-Second Rule - by making small energy adjustments we can reroute the path of least resistance and replace bad habits with good ones.<br /><br />Social Investment - avoid retreating within ourselves during tough times and invest more in building our social support network to propel ourselves forward.<br /><br />But as the old proverb teaches, \\"it's good as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough.\\" The field of positive psychology is rapidly moving beyond happiness to well-being and on to flourishing. This is a much deeper, lasting, and ultimately more fulfilling place. Happiness is a byproduct of well-being and flourishing but not the end goal. The founder of Positive Psychology (and the field's rock star), Martin Seligman's book, [[ASIN:1439190763 Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being]] is at the forefront of this radical rethinking of the flood of happiness research. Another excellent book that's more toward well-being and flourishing and surpasses the personal growth advice in The Happiness Advantageis Barbara Frederickson's [[ASIN:0307393747 Positivity: Top-Notch Research Reveals the 3 to 1 Ratio That Will Change Your Life]].<br /><br />If Amazon allowed it, I'd rate \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" 3.6/5. It doesn't quite live up to its sub-title and deals with one dimension of our emotional health and well being. On the other hand, it is an entertaining summary of happiness research and applications. And its seven principles are well proven methods for dealing with life's setbacks, navigating difficult change, building resilience, and increasing optimism and happiness.<br /><br />In reading and reviewing \\"The Happiness Advantage,\\" I was struck - once again - by the point that whether for our own personal growth or leading others, it's not what we know that makes us effective. It's applying that knowledge that matters.is Barbara Frederickson's [[ASIN:0307393747 Positivity: Top-Notch Research Reveals the 3 to 1 Ratio That Will Change Your Life]].<br /><br />If Amazon allowed it, I'd rate \\"The Happiness Advantage\\" 3.6/5.

B0002ZMITY|4.0|I've seen this movie several times and if you were a fan of the Ali G series on HBO or in the UK, you'll definitely get a laugh here as well. This movie is right up there with Borat as far as I'm concerned.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|Be warned, this movie includes foul language and makes fun of religion in favor of evolution.  I'm religious and not in favor of foul language, but I put this movie in the category of a comedy and can enjoy it without letting it have any effect on my testimony.<br /><br />I like spoofs, especially science fiction spoofs.  One of my favorite movies of all times is Galaxy Quest.  Paul is different, but it has the same general feel and elicits similar belly laughs and great quotable lines.  It pokes fun at area 51 and Roswell, New Mexico.  It's fast paced, with very little dead time.  The only actors that I recognize are Sigourney Weaver and Jason Bateman, but the acting was very good.  I don't want to give the story line away, so I won't.  Suffice it to say that I gave it five stars and compare it to Galaxy Quest.  If you like science fiction spoofs or just a really funny movie, I highly recommend watching Paul.

Although the girls who have left the group at various times will be missed, I feel that the addition of Lisa Lambe is a welcome one. She adds a special verve and charm to the already charismatic charms of the others.  David's arrangements are again spot-on and the blend of the girls talents provides vocal and instrumental enchantment.  Five stars -- well earned!

B0052UZIFA|3.0|truly a great addicting game, but this version is in bad need of an update... graphical tearing, slow transition between rounds, lost saved games and achievements, and no survival mode (which is heart breaking) .... i sure wish PopCap would remember to fix the other versions rather than only focusing the xbox and apple versions....
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have had this case for 5 weeks and I love it. The stand works perfect for me and I really like how it adds almost no additional size and weight to the kindle fire. I have a kindle keyboard and I would definitely buy this case for my kindle keyboard if it was available.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented on how the inside attracts pet fur, it really does attract an abnormal amount of fur. I have had a kindle for 3 years and had numerous cases during that time, they all attract some fur, but this one is really bad. I almost sent it back when I first received it for this reason but I liked everything else about it so much that I decided to see if I could do something about this.<br /><br />First I used a piece of duct tape to remove all the fur that had accumulated on the inside of the case. Then I put a dryer sheet in the dryer for about 10 minutes. I removed the dryer sheet and rubbed it on the inside of the case, this made the inside a lighter shade of black. Last I took a piece of scotch tape (don't use duct tape on this step as it will remove too much)and removed the excess chemicals from the dryer sheet that were on the inside of the cover. This made a huge difference in the amount of fur that accumulates on the case. Fur does still accumulate but not anymore than any other kindle case I've owned and it is fairly easy to remove. Again, this does NOT completely prevent the case from accumulating fur but it really does make a huge difference. Before I did this I probably would have given the case 3.5 stars, now I easily give it 5 stars.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I saw the previews for this movie in a commercial on the Super Bowl.  Real active duty SEALS in a movie??!! No way.  Checked out the website - well, I'll be darned - yes way.  How 'bout that?  Not only that, no CGI and LIVE fire (yeah, real bullets)?!  Okay, this just gets better and better.  Gotta check it out.  Well, I did and it's a good thing the theater had the option of reserved seating because when I went on Saturday afternoon the matinee was sold out as were the evening showings.<br /><br />I don't even know where to start.  This movie, in all honesty, is one of the best I have ever seen.  I'm writing this two days after seeing the movie and there were scenes I will never, ever forget.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER:  The extract will absolutely keep you on the edge of your seat.  The actual Act will gut you.  You have been warned.<br /><br />Hurt Locker was a very, very good movie, but that was actors and Hollywood.<br /><br />Act of Valor goes way, way beyond that because the military cast is the real thing and they made sure the movie was filmed just that way.<br /><br />Hoo-Yah, guys!  Ya did good.  Movies really don't get better than this one.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|I recommend this movie to everyone.  It is one of the best films I have seen in awhile!  It is very inspirational!  I am so impressed with how they could make it totally believable that the actress lost her arm and yet not have \\"Blood and Guts\\" scenes.  It was really tastefully done!

0307279189|5.0|This book is amazing. The story telling is wonderful, the characters funny and interesting, and the story itself is inspiring.  I'd been wanting to read it for a few years but for some reason hadn't taken the first step.  I received it as a gift late last year and I let it sit on my stack of \\"soon-to-be-read\\" books.  After finishing a couple of books on business and politics I picked this up looking for a fun read.  It was perfect. I read it in 2 days and I'm not a fast reader. I just could not put it down! You will not be disappointed.  It's been about a week since I finished it and I'm still replaying chapters of the book in my mind.  And I've started to declutter my life and work out more as a result.  I see myself giving this book as a gift to friends. I can't wait to read upcoming books by McDougall.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|I will not go into detail and give anything away, but this film was unusually heartfelt, not because it so well told a story, but because it told a story that, in my opinion, has not been told enough or thought about sufficiently.  The story, to simplify, is that man does not appreciate others to the extent he should and is much weaker for it.  Man's strength comes from the appreciation and love of others, particularly if those others derive their strength from a source that is generally not appreciated as a source, but as a weakness they feel exists within themselves that can become a strength when harnessed to a will to tell the truth, even when one doubts the courage to be able to do so.  I can only ask you to view this film to be able to understand my review that may not be as clear as I would like.  Other films have been made that are similar, but to the best of my knowledge, few have delivered the story and the message as well as \\"The Help\\".  You would have to be one cold hearted SOB (which I may approach) not to appreciate the telling of this story.  I would urge you to view it because it so well addresses a problem that still exists in our society with intelligence and humanity that is rare and fruitful beyond what we often have the opportunity to experience.<br /><br />As a transplant from Pennsylvania and my wife from the Netherlands before that, our kids were born and raised in Tennessee.  Because of some of the cultural differences that exist and even strengthen our family, I will make sure we view this film together for the purpose of one of our frequent family dinner table discussions which now include a son-in-law and daughter-in-law, the goal of which is for us to check our thoughts and their alignment with our beliefs and actions.  This is an exercise we started many years ago because it makes for good dinner conversation, particularly when our kids were much younger, but it also helps teach how to have a difference of opinion without insulting and maintaining respect for one another.  But, what is important with this film is its history of race relations that my kids did not live through when violence was the method of resolving differences and hate was the prevalent emotion.  The Help is an excellent film that lends itself to family discussion what those in our family believe are important principles that we want to hold dear even though we are not perfect in out execution.<br /><br />Even though I was not familiar with any of the actors, the acting in The Help is very good because it is simply believable with none of the parts being the victim of over acting and exaggeration.  I felt that these were real people being filmed in a real story.  It also seemed as if I got to know and accept the parts played as real people with real problems.  I also could not detect any deviation from the time period even though the video depiction of the age added important realism to the story.<br /><br />I had heard on the news today that The Help might be up for an academy award but I did not hear for what categories it was being considered.  I believe the film should be seriously considered for best picture.  I have this opinion because the film was so well assembled, with an equal level of good acting, a great screenplay and story, etc,etc.  There were just too many good things in this movie for any to stand out except for best picture.  When I finish this review in a few minutes I will go and check the results and probably learn how wrong I was.  But then I will never understand how those people making so much money must also have the adoration of their fans and the \\"Academy\\".  When most other professions have to live with love or money, actors must have both.  I guess that's OK if they continue to make movies like \\"The Help\\".maintaining respect for one another.

030746363X|5.0|The book attempts to be a users manual for the human body...and it almost pulls it off.<br />There are sections for losing weight, gaining strength, body building techniques, rehabing \\"permanent\\" injuries, and even better sex. Buying this book alone for the \\"slow carb\\" diet pays for itself.  This book is NOT written to be read cover-to-cover.  Ideally you choose the applicable sections, learn, and implement the ideas.<br /><br />The Sections That Paid Off for Me:<br />1. The \\"slow carb\\" diet proposed in the weight loss section was great.<br />I dropped from 245 to 190 and then I plateaued.  I then did HCG to get to 174 lbs and now I maintain my weight w/ another diet though I'm VERY tempted to switch to the slow-carb diet again because my energy levels were fantastic while my main source of carbs was beans...I only hesitate because I like my body composition now and I don't want to rock-the-boat.<br /><br />2. The section on reversing \\"permanent\\" injuries was useful.<br />I never heard of ART (active release therapy) before the book.

The website fourhourbodycouple.com does a GREAT job of summarizing the steps in single easy-to-understand cheat sheets.  Sorry Tim Ferris but this website does a better job than you in summarizing your ideas.  Despite a few writing hickups, I give this book a well deserved 5-stars because it changed my life for the better...
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is a fun family movie that doesn't surpass the former Disney princesses but is still a wonderful movie to enjoy that has catchy tunes that you'll remember
B004EPYZUS|2.0|A minority report (no pun intended)-<br />I understand I will be the only one that feels this way, but honestly, this latest Mission Impossible left me hoping that they don't make a 5th. The Plot had potential but came up short for me. Shot in locations that don't very often have the good fortune be filmed in and for good reason - no one cares about making a pit stop in Mumbai to climb a building or Dubai to visit a Millionaire playboy with 6 cell phones and a hair style that would make Elvis jealous.<br />The rag-tag team that they put together for this film was the worst of the 4 movies by far. It could not have gotten any more cliché if they tried. The Veteran, who swaddles his far less than experienced co-agents' mistakes, the Rookie agent, who bungles nearly every miniscule task and makes up for it with humor, the hot chick with an axe to grind and the slightly out of practice desk agent with a secret to hide. Add a dash of revenge, some slapstick and gadgets, although cool, that defy all reason. Put that together and you've got more like a Saturday morning cartoon than an IMF team. Let's face it; the Rescue Rangers could have pulled this off in a window of 22 min.<br />The Bad Guys - what can I say? They were practically nonexistent. Aside for a romp through a dust storm and a slip n' fall sequence in an automated parking garage there was NOTHING that made these Baddies special. One hardly spoke a word throughout the whole film; and it wasn't like he was a brooding mute that would rather do his taking with his dukes, which would have been cool, he just didn't say anything. Half way through the film I had to recall that he was one of the players in this movie.<br />The dedicated and completely inept Russian agents were totally unnecessary. They ran around the world chasing the American only get beat up on an escalator, hardly a triumph for Russian combat training. Then to pop up 5 seconds after \\"mission accomplished\\" to realize that all is well and that it wasall part of the plan. The assassin tried to be cool with her \\"payment only in diamonds\\" nonsense, but her build up and character expansion was a lot like watching someone get pushed out of a 130 story window; quick, splat, move on. The \\"major villain\\", such that he was, had no character build up except for a DVD monolog about his penchant for nuclear holocaust. Other than that, he provided the highly trained IMF agent with a surprisingly combative prowess, especially for a slightly overweight politician that did little more than silently swing around a metal case.<br />I give this movie 2 stars only for the well put together jail break scene in the beginning. It actually felt like a Mission Impossible movie but quickly and silently slipped into a film of mediocrity.
B006GH6IS4|3.0|This is a gripe to the \\"powers\\" that be,Queens 40th anniversary could have been really special.Instead of just remastered cds and this extended version dvd there could have been all sorts of classic concert footage(1973-1980)released in volumes which I'm sure fans wouldve eaten up!Its out there(Ive got many a bootleg to prove it!),why not put it out? \\"Fire at the Bowl\\" and \\"We will Rock You\\" are great and all,but 80's Queen were nowhere as intense as 70's Queen! That said,this is a decent release with a \\"little\\" extra live footage added on.Why they didnt add more cocert footage and (way less!)interview is beyond me.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Graphics are very good. I found the different levels very entertaining. I hope G5 continues to put out these quality games for Kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is perfect for my needs. It has such great choices for my needs that I rarely bring my Bible with me now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app because it is so fun. my favorite part is how the games are not handed to you you have to earn the games
B00000612Q|5.0|I know everybody cites \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" as his best.And while I agree that it is a great record,it pales(just a bit!)in comparison.Every song on this cd gets an A+ rating.Its worth purchasing just for his cover of Hendrixs' \\"Angel\\" alone.I actually think he does a better version of the song.The opening song \\"True Blue\\" is a balls-to-the wall rocker!Another favourite is the bluesy \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" very Stones-like.It all closes with \\"Twistin The Night Away\\".this being his original cover of the Sam Cooke classic,not the whimpy remake he did in the 80's.This is one essential release!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game...love the variety and the fact that you have to unlock games. Gives you something to work towards.<br />Hoping to find more like it in the future.
B0035KTIOQ|5.0|This review is for the Warner 180g vinyl edition.  Communique is my second favorite Dire Straits album (Freshman debut is Best).  While it didn't possess any super mega hits the songwriting and music is second to none.  Some of my favorite songs are : News, Angel OF Mercy, and Single Handed Sailor. The 180g is a huge improvment over the orginal 78' release.  The sounds are nice and full, good seperation and vocals are easy to hear ( which is great considering Mark's low vocal range.)  Anyway, I'm keeping this short , but I say this edition of Communique is a must for any true Dire Straits fan.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Love this little game.  Very addictive and can't put it down.  80s twist but not impossible or frustrating.  My kids like it too.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins gives a shape and vocabulary to the thoughts and doubts that almost all of the open-minded thinking people have at least once in their lives, but may not know how to articulate them. The whole cultural environment of fear and mystique surrounding organized religions creates a thick fog that restricts clear thinking and makes it difficult to see the \\"light\\". It is very clear to everyone that religion is a part of human nature; a way for us to combat uncertainty and insecurity we all feel because the natural universe is so big and complicated. I actually wish I could be as religious as some of the people I know since it would be very reassuring to feel that someone is watching over me and every failure and disappointment I face can be attributed to some divine will. As a result, it becomes easier to face problems and to remain positive and satisfied.<br /><br />However, to me it doesn't seem right to subscribe to fairy tales even if such faith could make your life easier. The question is: can you face the life yourself or do you need a manufactured divine intervention to survive the challenges that life throws at you?<br /><br />If you are brave enough to face the facts and curious enough to understand why religions and Gods consume human psyche around the world, then this book is an essential reading. On the other hand, if you are not willing to let go of divine support because the alternative seems cold and bleak, then you will just end up searching for counter-arguments to the point this book makes. This will be an utter waste of time as when you bring \\"faith\\" into the argument, then reason stops working.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is one of those movies that grabs you at the start and keeps you interested until the end where you're hungry for more! A great cast all the way around. I especially like Chris Pine, but also absolutely love casting of Spock, Montgomery Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu and Bones. And the young Kirk with the corvette at the beginning is one of my favorite parts! They all make this movie worth watching again and again, which I have done! I think the story itself is a good one. It has a lot of action, start to finish, and some very funny parts, too, like when Bones keeps injecting Kirk (Pine) to get him on to the Enterprise. Very funny! I think the only negative for me is it ended! I don't think you have to be a Star Trek fan of the late 60s original TV series (or any of the others) to appreciate this movie either. Well worth watching and I'm glad to have it in my home movie library! Looking forward to the sequel release (hopefully) in May 2013. Meantime, buy this one!
B0071MV540|3.0|Ben Stiller. Eddie Murphy. Matthew Broderick. Alan Alda. Tea Leoni. A promising premise (a heist). I thought I'd LMAO the whole time. Well I smiled a bit... but never once LOL'd. More than anything I enjoyed the action scenes where they're hanging off the roof of a building and the shout outs to NYC but overall I found this to be disappointing. I gave it 3 stars because I liked it more than I didn't like it (and honestly because ratings on this site seem a bit higher than other places) but I wouldn't go out of my way to see this. Kind of thing I just stare at when it makes its way to TNT or something.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|I downloaded this app as part of FAOTD. The first time I launch the app I get an error message saying that I &quot;don't own the app&quot; and requests that I purchase it. Can you say rip-off
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app works great on the kindle fire! good way to pass some free time. no lag, smooth graphics. I like that you have the option to click on the card to move it or you can drag it.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Very good app, however I do have some frustrations.  Cant highlight or add personal notes without constant access to Internet.  Great app for reading other translations at ease but still people need to be able to access the Internet to access other tools in this app.  Those, such as myself, that does not have Internet at most places during the day this gets frustrating when I cant do highlights or add a note...  We should be able to use those tools and when we get Internet access the syncing process will begin.
B001Q2U5B0|2.0|I have no idea why this movie gets such a good rating on amazon. The acting is terrible, the plot turns are predictable (and at time ludicrous) and the final message of the story that everything would have been better if the main character was never born is absolutely uninspiring. I was optimistic coming in but after watching this I now think the airhead who recommended this to me when I said I like time travel stories is an idiot and probably only liked this movie because it was stupid simple (while pretending to be clever) and because she probably thought Ashton Kutcher was cute or something. This movie was total rubbish and a waste of my time.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Of any shows I have watched breaking bad has my full attention if amc drops this show to save money by breaking down by shorting the great story line I can say they are making a horrible decision...to the author and creator of this show thank you for an amazing story,bring more to the veiwer surprise me and you will have my complete attention every season no matter were u go,HBO,or were ever....
B006G2NVCA|3.0|Just wondering when did NIN become Brian Eno???  Trent, I don't think music soundtracks are your Forte!  It may be bringing in lots of money, but your hidden talent is being compromised by the movie industry.  Same thing that happened to Tangerine Dream in the '80s!  Please get back on track for all your fans, but more importantly... for Yourself!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|When Adele's \\"21\\" was first released, I was a bit confused about the hype surrounding it. I had no idea who the singer was or why this album was such a big deal. However, in the last year, I've gotten it - here is a young woman who is a force to be reckoned with, and this album proves it.<br /><br />Adele's voice is remnant of a time gone by, of a style of singing that, unfortunately, has slipped away from mainstream radio. She not only displays blues vocals, but has created masterpieces in songwriting. These tunes are brilliant in not only how they are written but also how they are put together. There's a delicacy and authenticity to the recording of them that is a rare gem in the world of mass-produced music we hear so much of today.<br /><br />'Rolling in the  Deep', the record's first single, is a true blues number about loss, as are 'Rumour Has It', 'He Won't Go', and 'Take It All'. Other songs, like 'Don't You Remember', 'I'll Be Waiting', and 'Lovesong' (the only cover song on the record), have more of a jazz vibe. And then there are the ballads - brilliant songs like 'Turning Tables', mega-hit 'Someone Like You', and 'One and Only'. The only song that could be classified as remotely like pop is current single 'Set Fire to the Rain', but even then, there is a distinctness in emotion here that differs from anything else out there.<br /><br />Initially, I wasn't sure an album with so much hype could possibly live up to its expectations. But this one has done that and more. Adele is a rare gift in the music world today, carving out a niche for herself in an industry that often seems to be homogenizing. She's certainly made me sit up and take notice, and I can't wait to go back and explore her debut record.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Sometimes the simplest things are the most entertaining and that's how I'd describe this game.  It starts off easy enough so the player doesn't want to quit right away, but quickly become challenging (and sometimes frustrating).  The music is very relaxing though, and there are hints that you can \\"buy\\" with the coins you earn in the game, so that's very helpful.  I play this on my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game has nice graphics, a reasonable sound track, and a pretty good sense of humor. The levels are challenging but not too difficult. Overall, it is a pleasant experience.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version was fun and challenging.  I enjoyed playing it. It was user friendly and allows for customization. Worth the download.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Cant wait to do more.Great game for kindle,good graphics,but hard to tap sometimes. I like seek and find and puzzles with good story line.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|Premise: Locke Lamora is an orphan and a sneak thief, but one with tremendous ingenuity and potential. He is brought into (and up by) the Gentlemen Bastards, possibly the most unusual gang of thieves in the complicated underworld of Camorr. When a newcomer threatens to overthrow the head of all the gangs, the Gentleman Bastards - and their current confidence scam - are caught in the middle.<br /><br />I don't say this often, but I have a sneaking suspicion this would be a better movie than it is a book.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I hoped to. I think it largely comes down to style, though. It's an action-intrigue caper plot, with plenty of double-dealing, late reveals, close calls, death and bloodshed. It does this perfectly well, but I never really connected with the protagonist. Locke is a skilled thief, con artist and actor, and very little ink is spilled on developing the man under all that. There are moments that seem to touch on his feelings for his friends or his profession or his city, but they never felt fully realized to me. He just wasn't anyone. He had no personality under his talents, beyond the broadest most obvious strokes.<br /><br />The characters didn't seem to have examined their own lives very closely when we meet them, and while the developments of the plot challenge their health and their ingenuity, they never really challenge their morality or cause them to grow in any way.<br /><br />Now that said, the world is interesting, the characters are colorful, and the plot is nicely twisty. Camorr as fantasy Venice is fantastic, and the constantly shifting plots and alliances are exciting. In a movie, when you can just trust the character to be in the eyes of your lead actor if he's cast well, this could be an awesome experience.<br /><br />The present-day story is interwoven with flashbacks that show how the group came together and trained, and while these are all interesting, and many are important for later plot points, it did mean that the book took a lot of pages to ramp up the pace. Some characters who are hinted at being important early on never even show up in this volume.<br /><br />There's a seriously dark turn at one point that really took me aback, and I had trouble enjoying the book afterward. I guess I'd rather if it had earned it with more character depth. You don't need character depth for a caper, you do if you are writing something you want to have dramatic weight.<br /><br />Still, it was fun for most of the ride, and the ending was fairly satisfactory.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I read this story a long time ago and was incredibly impressed with the world that Scott Westerfeld created. The characters are real and relatable and the story plot is intense and suspenseful. I don't know why this series hasn't gained more fame. It has flown under the radar for awhile now, but it should be made into a movie. It has a good message of self-image also! I'm about to read this book again (which I rarely do, by the way). If you haven't read this series yet, do yourself a favor and read this first book. You'll be hooked! It is truly amazing. :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is pretty good. and it actually does show instructions. good app. and its good for when your bored. some of the games are great techniques. i like it. i recomande it. sorry for my spelling I'm tired.
1439153663|5.0|This book popped up on my Amazon recommendation list.  For some reason the description just didn't appeal to me and I didn't buy it for some time.  I am glad I finally did!  The story revolves around Lavinia, an Irish indentured servant who lives and works with a group of slaves on a Virginia plantation.  The story follows the twists and turns of the lives of the slaves and the plantation family, much like Downton Abbey, only a little more juicy.  If you're looking for an interesting, page-turning read, this is your book!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|this game is very fun and colorful. I really had fun playing this. The only thing is the allfather. He is immpossible to beat. HELP
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have downloaded and tried many apps, like most of us app junkies out there. Evernote continues to remain one of my favorites and continues to get better. I use it on my desktop PC, my ChromeBook (Cr-48), my Blackberry, and just added it to my Kindle Fire.
B000ASATYO|5.0|This director's cut DVD release has picture and audio quality that is nothing short of amazing.  I watched it on my PS3, with my surround sound, and it nearly felt as if I were watching a BluRay at multiple points.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty effing legit. its too legit too legit to quit. I'm a beast at every game high scores all over
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|App force closes each time I try to run it. It looked like it might be fun but how would I know? I'm glad I didn't pay anything!
B000002KHH|5.0|What can I say about Paranoid that hasn't already been said a thousand times by everyone else? To be honest not much. If a person knows even the slightest about Sabbath it is in relation to this album with the name songs Iron Man and Paranoid. To this day it's cited as THE metal album that put the genre on the map. If the self titled created it, then Paranoid perfected it, right? Well there's no denying that Paranoid is an excellent album, but it isn't what I call the definitive metal album or even Sabbath's best, but still a great album. The problem with Paranoid is that half of it has been played to death while the other is relatively unknown in comparison. Sure War Pigs, Iron Man, and Paranoid are great, but after hearing them so many times they just don't quite have the charm they used to. So on to the individual tracks:<br /><br />1. War Pigs 10/10 Sure I just said this one has been overplayed, but it's still a brilliant 8 minute long masterpiece. It's one of Bill Ward's shining achievements as a drummer showcasing his talent that is perfectly infused with the rest of the band. Geezer's lyrics make it the classic anti-war song that we all know and love. It's great.<br /><br />2. Paranoid 9/10 The \\"filler\\" track we all know the story behind. It's Sabbath's classic baby, and created in just around 20 minutes. It's quick, but great as ever. Ozzy's vocal delivery at it's finest. Simply a good track.<br /><br />3. Planet Caravan 9/10 The experimental track that works brilliantly. Ozzy singing through a voice modifier on top of the surreal sounding instrumentation is a one of a kind experience. The drums have a soft tribal beat with the guitar softly playing. The solo is excellent, it's a shame that this one doesn't get more recognition.<br /><br />4. Iron Man 7/10 Yes it's the classic Iron Man, and you know what? After hearing it so often it's lost the majority of it's charm. The riff is no longer heavy and appealing, but rather just annoying. I've heard it entirelytoo much and it just doesn't work as well for me anymore. It's still a great track, but I just don't enjoy it as much anymore.<br /><br />5. Electirc Funeral 9/10 On to side B the more unknown side of the album and it starts off with an awesome track. A doomy riff that Iommi is so well known for. Another anti-war song with a great performance by Ozzy, especially when he's actually singing the Electric Funeral line. As usual the entire band plays great to make this yet another stand-out track.<br /><br />6. Hand Of Doom 10/10 The absolute best track on the album in my opinion. The way the songs progresses is like no other with a very basic main riff and beat to start it off. Ozzy's vocals come in and he delivers the classic Geezer lyrics we all know. Then we go into a heavier extension of the main riff with the volume turned up and Ozzy offering his best vocal of the album. Then we get a complete change in the song mid-way through to a faster pace that works brilliantly before going back to the simple main riff. It's an epic 7 minute track that work's brilliantly.<br /><br />7. Rat Salad 8/10 It's just a short solo piece for Iommi and Ward. Ward gives a great solo, as does Iommi, but you can't help but wish there was more to it. You get the feeling that this was a track just put on here for the sake of needing another song. But it's prime Sabbath playing, not much to complain about.<br /><br />8. Faries Wear Boots 9/10 The most known song off of side B of the album. A great way to end the album. A great main riff with Geezer standing out in particular with an excellent bass riff. The lyrics are delivered excellently by Ozzy in a neat and different way. I don't know how exactly it's so different, but it just is to me. It's overall another great song all around to finish off the album.<br /><br />So there's Paranoid as a whole. It's a great album, and there's very little to say else. If your a metal fan then this absolutely needs to be in your collection and if your just starting out is a brilliant place to start. If you don't own it, do yourself a favor and buy it right now!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app includes an addware program with it and that acts just like an virus on my kindle fire every time I tried to use my web browser it sent me to Android Market and all other pages or sites would not show. Take my advice for at least kindle fire users DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!
1250006341|5.0|The book The World Of Downtown Abbey is just the most wonderful book to own.  It is full of colorful shots of the characters in the PBS series.  It looks like a $40.00 book easy.  Very well thought out and I am so happy to of gotten it on amazon.  Its a nice size book.  But not too big.  Tells the wonderful story of Downtown Abbey and all the great characters that are in the story.<br />A real big fan of the Downton Abbey Series on PBS
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Love her CD, she's young though sounds so much older. She sings of things we can all relate to in an amazing unique way that does not compare to anyone else. She is in a class of her own. Highly recommend it. And of course Amazon plays the middle man in a quick, easy, efficient way, the way to acquire what you want.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This set is very cool.  I'm not sure who likes it more.  My wife, or two kids.  I have several different Lego sets.  Most of them are Star Wars.  This set, by far, has the best detail.  The houses have little pieces of furniture, and even fire places.  The duck, and chickens are really cool.  Very neat set.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|the game works great on my Samsung Epic.  It is a funny and retro game.  I am glad i got it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is great and works flawlessly on my Droid Incredible!  Very easy to play and a great way to burn some time.  Would recommend.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Get both of her CD's, but this one is even better. Great as back ground music or to sing along with, she's a great addition to anyone's home entertainment.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|I love dominoes, and was looking forward to having it on my Kindle Fire. The app itself isn't too bad. However, I was hoping that it would have the option of two people players along with the computer and a person. The only way more than one person can play at a time is to play together against the computer. The dominoes are a little small, but I think it works for how large a game can get. Just a little dissappointed, but it's a nice addition to the games I already have.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining to play. and very addictive. it keeps your mind thinking at all times.the only issue is how many points it takes to unlock the games.
0062060554|5.0|For a first time author , this book is great  Character development and suspenceful and what an ending  I would recommend it highly.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I ordered this for a college art class and it was a big hit. The instructor thought she could not go wrong with \\"Babies\\" being the subject.
B00129H7VS|5.0|If I taught history class this series would be part of the curriculum.  Gives you a glimmer why they were part of what is now called \\"the greatest generation\\".  My only complaint, and this is probably just my failing, is that I had a hard time keeping up with who was who on screen.  GIs in battle dress uniforms running around, lots of action, characters you know and don't know dieing, surviving, etc...  tracking was a little hard at first.  Still well worth it and totally deserving of 5 stars.
B000V5Y2E4|3.0|When it ended, I was like \\"thats it\\"? The part of those two kids trading stuff was fun, but I never know if they got their gold press latinum. And that part with that old Bajorian man kinda went on as expected. It was basically a typical day in the life of Starfleet...

B001VNB54A|4.0|This is not a failing of the movie, or the quality of the acting, directing, etc... its just that the Pacific theater of the war, IMHO, while much more horrific than most of the European part of WWII, just wasn't as engaging a story (guys in jungle on uninhabited islands, fighting an enemy that is hard to relate to).  Band of Brothers was a bit better in this regard.  This one, because of the lack of engagement, spent whole episodes following guys in more mundane stuff just to give the audience something more...character development, drama, change of scenery, etc...  This was something that wasn't as necessary in the original Band of Brothers.  Still very worth watching/getting though.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Simply does not start on the Sprint's Samsung Galaxy Sll. I had to un install. done done, what's with the 13 words required to leave a review?!<br /><br />I revised my rating from a 1 to a 4 because the developer emailed me and explained that it doesn't work on my SG2 but on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 its beautiful!  I don't know if its suppose to be playable via the accelerometer or just touch the corners but I it only works with left/right corner thumb touches.  If anyone knows how to get it to work via accelerometer please let me know, thanks.

B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Opening the box, It looked too big. After setting and wearing it a bit, I love it. I can read it without glasses (20/50 vision with bi-focals), and in little (no!) light. The chrono is small dials, all marked, useful but not good for event timing, etc. I love the 1/10 sec readout. Overall, it has become my fav daily wearer. In price, worth every dime.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|i don't mind the retro graphics, but the gameplay os horrible. i agree with other reviewers that autofire sucks. also, way too easy to accidentally pause while playing. lots of much better games out there. it did run properly on my htc tbolt
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I have always been a HUGE Eminem fan and on this album he did not disappoint. I'm glad he brought out some out the topics he did and the old him is back.
B004LTB5OG|5.0|I have been catching up with the past decade of neo progressive rock and I must say this is one fantastic freaking album! As you know the guitarist sounds a lot like David Gilmour crossed with Steve Rothery from Marillion! The vocals upon first listen really irritated me for some reason but now I find his voice very endearing. This has that perfect balance between melody and musicianship. The guitar solos are phenomenal. I think this is by far the best neo progressive rock album of the last decade.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Really great game, the campaign is addicting, finished it rather quickly but it is still tons of fun to replay. The other modes are also great, and the graphics are very vivid. Asus transformer prime tf201 android 4.0

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game.  I play it a bunch.  I not sure I would play any other type of game.
0002247399|2.0|Before I say anything, I would like to note that I am a HUGE fan of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. I loved the first four books. I love the HBO series. I was super excited for ADWD to come out, having the book pre-ordered and waiting its arrival.<br /><br />Knowing that I may have to wait a few years for book 6, I was scared to read through it within a week. It's now the end of February 2012 and I FINALLY finished the book.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but GRRM really lost focus of his writing. ADWD was completely opposite of his first four books. It lacked suspense.  It dropped story lines once it got interesting. Out came a character from the wind completely changing the course of the story and for no reason at all. It became one LONG conversation after another. Page after page of worthless information. He said in his memo that we will get to our main line of story with previous POV from book 4. But only 1 chapter for one and 2 for another? Where was the point in that? So many times, I found myself taking a break from the book because nothing came out of the pages. What was the editor thinking? Everything could have been summed up around 100 pages.<br /><br />Now, in all fairness, there were some really great scenes in the book. But a few scenes didn't keep my interest for the overall part of the series.<br /><br />If book 6 reacts the same way, I'll have the greatest probability of not caring about book 7. I really hope this book was a fluke and that book 6 moves especially like 1-4. It's just disheartening when you have a series that was a 10+ full of suprises and suspense turn into a 6 now because of the disappointment of the fifth book. Though part in turn I blame GRRM, but a huge fault goes to his editors.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Awful.<br /><br />Though others have appreciated the cinematography, plot,  acting, and music, I did not.<br /><br />The feel is like...Michael Bay took a zanax. With the exception of the action sequences, every scene is about a minute longer than it had to be. I couldn't find the artistic merit of staring at Ryan Gossling's face and watching him try to act like he isn't not smiling. Instead of stretching out a scene to add tension, every scene is stretched to the point you want to fast forward. Had I watched this in a theatre, I would have started shouting about 10 minutes in. I fast-forwarded through 20 minutes of the movie and lost NOTHING in the plot.<br /><br />The plot is a bit like Fast and Furious meets Leon the Professional. While I am not an admirer of Fast and Furious I am a huge fan of The Professional. The plot seems to...'imitate' the idea of a quiet and profound professional...driver who grows attached to his neighbor's child and tries to rescue the child and mother from the violence of the streets and an Italian mob. The difference is that in The Professional, Jean Reno uses these neat things called words. Those words make sentences, and those sentences make dialog, which makes the audience understand and appreciate the character. Here, we've substituted the gift of speech with the curse of 2 minutes of awkward silence.<br /><br />The acting is actually decent, and it's the saving grace. While Gossling's character is annoyingly silent, he tries hard to add a level of profundity. Unfortunately, the writing was so one-dimensional that I think Gossling was limited in his range, as well. Gossling flips from the silent type to the violent type rapidly, which really makes it tolerable and adds a level of curiosity on the subject of his character's background: was he a bipolar mute, a silent psychopath, a hitman with a severe studder? Why won't he talk? Gossling manages to make the crappy writing look like method acting. Props to him. He can hold still forvery long periods of time.<br /><br />The music, well, wasn't my kind of music. I'm not a fan of hip-hop/ R &B/ techno/ whatever music that was which sounded like I should hear it at a rave.  I don't fault the movie for not appealing to my musical tastes. But the music didn't seem to fit the tone of the movie. I would have elected to use Haydin's Surprise Symphony, or maybe the sound of crickets chirping.<br /><br />If you're going to be on a 3 hour flight from Denver to Columbus and have one or two drinks in you, give this a shot. But not sober, and not unless you have nothing else to watch.
0812971825|3.0|In Abide with Me, Elizabeth Strout returns to the world of small-town inland Maine in the 1950s with the story of a young minister who's left with two small daughters following the cancer death of the beautiful but unsuitable wife who married him on the rebound and lived to regret it. Rev. Tyler Caskey is a quiet and gentle man who reminds me of some of Anne Tyler's most memorable characters -- but without the low-key quirks which are her signature. His eldest daughter, four-year-old Katherine,has stopped speaking since her mother's death, and Tyler hasn't really noticed. The teachers at Kate's school and the parishioners at Tyler's parish mistake his grief-driven disengagement for arrogance. When the small-town rumor mill spreads a salacious but unlikely rumor about the minister, parishioners nursing their own inconsequential grievances about Tyler quickly embrace it, inspiring mutual resentment that leads to a surprising denouement. Strout's fiction is heavy on instrospection, which might not be to the taste of readers who prefer action.
B000JML7EC|5.0|this is a really good book.  Alot of the things that we associate with pirates (pieces of eight, parrots, treasure, etc.) are from it.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|As I watch each of the Transformers movies, I find myself even more in love with the series!!! With each movie, its been great to see how Sam has grown. With this one it has more action and its setting up for the forth one. If you are a true fan, this is a must have to complete your collection!!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love it. My favorite game. Creepy, music. I am now prepared for the Zombie takeover. My house will be safe.
B000O59AFC|3.0|I didn't buy this, and thank goodness for that! I rented the BR via Netflix for my new A/V setup, and let me tell you, this was the WORST quality transfer of a Blu-ray disc I've seen yet. I can't believe they even have this on BR. The sound was fine, but there were so many glitches, pixelation & quality of color/depth issues, I could barely enjoy the film. And I was really looking forward to a spectacular home theater experience that'd blow me away, after a long day.<br /><br />The film itself I hadn't seen since it originally came out in the theater. Boy, I thought I liked it better than I did. Pretty cheesy. Cruise's acting probably the best part of it all. Parts 2 & 3 are next, and I believe I liked those better. We shall see.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this Blu-ray. Rent it instead.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|this app is junk.  hides the ship so you play blind. not worth the time it took to download. Glad it was free!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This movie is awesome!!! One of my favorite's. With a great cast of action stars, you can't go wrong. If you like a movie that keeps you glued from start to finish, this action movie will do that.
B005HEWO44|4.0|Voyager has to integrate the Marquis crew to replace its dead.  I liked this episode as it deals with new sci-fi ideas and phenomenon.  And there's lots of special effects.  4.0/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
0439023513|5.0|This book was very different and much darker than the other Hunger Games books.  I was shocked when some of my favorite characters met their demise, but in the end I liked the way the author tied up the story and with who Katniss ended up with.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|This case allows me to carry a great load of wipes at any given time. My toddler is a messy one (who's isn't?!) and the ability to have so many wipes on me in a convenient case is a LIFE SAVER. And they stay moist!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I absolutely Love this Album, definitely will buy more of Adele!! It's not for nothing that she won 6 out of 6 of her nominations!!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is an excellent family movie for all family members and at whatever season of family life!  Quality of the DVDs are excellent! Very pleased and we have already watched twice in a month!
B005LL4U54|1.0|Ludovic Bource's lengthy and embarrassing acceptance speech at the Academy Awards managed to thank Sheila E., but did not mention Bernard Herrmann.<br /><br />Likewise, director Michel Hazanavicius' response to Kim Novak crying foul about using one of film music's most iconic moments--\\"I used music from another movie, but it's not illegal. We paid for that, we asked for that and we had the permission to do it\\"--has all the class of a brothel patron not understanding why you are upset that he \\"used\\" a favorite neice!<br /><br />During Bernard Herrmann's Centenary Year it's more than a little disappointing that the makers of a film entitled \\"The Artist\\" don't give credit where credit is due to one of cinema's Supreme Artists: some \\"Love Letter\\" to Hollywood!
B005EF1EX8|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Every episode has some sort of meaning and really leaves you wanting to watch the next. AMC is really one of the best at making shows.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|I am very happy with this album. Gojira have made a habit of continuously outdoing themselves. This album is MUCH heavier and darker. It is a bit more drastic when you compare it to the more relaxed pacing, if that makes any sense, of From Mars To Sirius. A lot of what I'm thinking in my head, while comparing The Way of All Flesh to previous albums, makes little to no sense. I'll just leave it as this album is amazing. It is a great fit for people who like their metal heavy, intriguing, relentless, and deep. Damn, I love this album.
B001ILFUD2|3.0|I was glad I found this DVD, we've been looking for it for a while. Overall the quality of the video is not that great, some fuzziness, probably because we played it in blue ray.
0439023513|5.0|I just LOVED this series, and I think this book was a wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />BIG SPOILERS<br /><br />I think the ending, how in SPITE OF EVERYTHING Katniss and Peeta find a way to go on and survive what has happened to them and the world they know, it really did show the triumph of the human spirit.  The dandelion...reverting back to simple things like home and hearth...building a new life on the ashes of the old one pin District 12...I think that is so beautiful, and having children, so brave.  I did like the character of Gale, but I don't think Katniss would have made him happy -- he was too dark and brooding and still so angry I think, to have the disregard for human life he showed at times during Mockingjay.  Katniss and Peeta were more similar, both broken in a way, but I think they understood each other better.<br /><br />Some people have felt Katniss was \\"wimpy\\" in this book, and yes, she did cry and rely on drugs and cower in closets sometimes, but the way I see it, in spite of Katniss's emotional wounds, she was a brave warrior to the very end.  When Coin proposed the Hunger Games, sacrificing children to achieve political objectives, that is when Katniss realized Snow spoke the truth about Coin.  So Katniss agreed to the Hunger Games, so she would be trusted and be in a position to kill Coin and thereby end the Hunger Games -- at least, as long as people could remember the horror of those times.  As the author writes, 'We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self destruction.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I think Katniss's emotional state in this book makes her human and relatable and adds a sense of realism to the books, which I think was the point of the books -- to make readers connect to the books and draw parallels to real life -- so many parts of the series made me think about the Holocaust and the middle east.  The author comes from a military family that has experienced war first hand.  A Twilight type love-story was not her objective here, getting teens to think about war, what makes a war just, the horrors of war, the people who survive war -- that was her objective.her objective here, getting teens to think about war, what makes a war just, the horrors of war, the people who survive war -- that was her objective.
B0076R6MES|1.0|Saw the first third of this on a plane to the UK. Too stupid to continue. Think Pink Panther cross with James Bind but not nearly as good. Also some really off racial jokes... Forget this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is.reaally hard to do allow the games almost unreal to beat but the game is fun so I will give you a thumbs up
B003L77G8I|5.0|I received the dvd from seller in a short time after purchase, and in excellent condition.  After receiving it we did a Season 6 marathon.  Almost tempted to buy the Season 7 single epidodes, but I will wait for the whole set.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Can't stop trying to complete all the goals... This app will be the death of me. Great game to waste time.
0439023513|5.0|I have to admit when I started reading the negative reviews on the third book I was hesitant in reading it.  But the author did not disappoint me.  What I loved about this book was Katniss' ability to finally grow up emotionally and recognize her potential as a warm and loving woman.  Through all the pain of fighting a war to gain freedom, and overcoming tragic adversity she was able to be the Phoenix, being reborn through the ashes of her tentative existence in a slave-driven society.<br /><br />I also loved what Plutarch said to her about how human beings were finally becoming humane.  Susan Collins did not fail her reader's, and I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional development of all her characters.  A beautiful, thought-provoking book series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|ever play solitaire before? then trust me, you'll love this game. it even has some little goodies to keep you interested.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|This book really dragged for me. While the eventual explanation of the mystery turned out interesting enough, I felt like I read so much unrelated filler in the meantime. I wish there had been more investigation or at least more options to the outcome to keep you guessing. Instead you're just kind of left with the fact that either he did it or he didn't and you just have to wait til you're told at the end. And while you're waiting here's a lot of descriptions of people and places and things that really don't matter and are kind of boring to read.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this movie. Contrary to what other reviewers say, the acting is excellent, especially Ryan Gosling. There is a lot communicated in the way he commands the screen in this movie, even without much dialogue. Also, reviewers have commented on the violence: I have seen more gore in other movies that were highly rated. More importantly, the violence is an essential part of the plot and is not at all gratuitous. It is clear that had the director wanted gratuitous violence he could have shown a lot more than he did.
B007E6YYLO|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes of season 2.  The heightened intensity is back, and has something for everyone.  Good character development and plenty of zombies.  I for one, commend Andrea for dealing with the situation the way she did.  I like that she does not conform to the stereotypical female role.  I also hope that they keep the new guy around, they need someone new in the group to shake things up.  Cant wait for next weeks episode.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so addicting! I can play for hours and not get bored! its also kinda challenging trying to beat high scores. definitely recommend to others
B00008PBZW|2.0|Low budget movie and it shows. Nicholas Cage's performance is so bad that every time I see him on the screen I just want to look away. It was painful to sit through 2 hours of the movie focusing on him and not the codetalkers (who the movie title suggests to be the main characters). The two codetalkers and the other sergeant (played by Christian Slater) who is supposed to protect one of them are my favorite. Seeing them always puts a smile on my face. To be honest I like everyone but Nicholas Cage's character. Get someone else to play him and I'd have rated this movie 2 stars higher for mentioning the role of the Indians in WWII. If you want to give this series a try, I highly suggest renting it.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|I love independent films and art house fare but this one is a major disappointment. Others have criticized Drive as being too slow, but it was spot on and very satisfying. It is also a good comparison in that it similarly has an abrupt, somewhat incomplete end. But Martha Marcy May Marlene seems so slow because there is no character development at all. If it wasn't for all the flashbacks the viewer would feel as if they were watching someone take a nap. None of the main characters has any arc or is changed by the circumstances. On top of that, the movie comes to an abrupt end just as you are expecting some kind of interesting plot development, ok any plot development. I'm fine with movies that leave you thinking, but this one leaves you thinking, \\"Where's the movie?\\" I agree with another reviewer that there is a film waiting to be made about leaving cults, but this isn't it. The actors are good, but not great given they have very little to work with.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|only player that I found that plays .mov files with audio. a must when you receive videos made by friends with an iPhone.
B004M3GDI4|2.0|I am a long time user of Petzl headlamps. Generally keep one in my pocket, with the strap hanging out for quick access, for use around the house or when doing telecom and cabling work. This particular model is way too big and heavy for the head, and for fitting comfortably in your pocket. Also, the beam is too narrow-focused. I returned this PIXA 3, and got a Tikka Plus 2, which I very much prefer.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|great game play, smart and witty cut screens. got it for free but would of paid. casual setting if your not quite a gamer.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, when we saw it at the theater, and wanted to have it as part of our home collection. The heartwarming story still shows well on the smaller home screen and makes for a enjoyable family evening. Definite A+ addition.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Not sure why all the negative reviews, find game to work great on my rooted Nook Color. If you like Mahjong, get this app.
B006P3HXZG|2.0|I bought this because my Wife and I bought a new 3D TV and we both enjoy good animated movies.<br />We loved Beauty and The Beast 3D, The Lion King 3D, Cars 2 3D and many others.<br />This movie we both thought was utterly stupid, very poor script, boring and just plain dumb.<br />the 3D and animation were really very good but couldn't enjoy it because of the poor script.<br />in my opinion it would be a waste of money even at $10.00. It was just not fun unless i guess<br />you are a small kid.
B0000009SG|4.0|The first \\"new\\" Zappa album I purchased was [[ASIN:B0000009S0 Cruising with Ruben & The Jets]]...it had only been out for a month or so. I proceeded to back-fill my collection with all of his past releases, and from that point on, eagerly awaited each new release.<br /><br />This was an odd, transitional perriod in Zappa's career. Following the injuries sustained when a deranged fan tossed him from the stage of London's Rainbow Theater in 1971, he released [[ASIN:B0000009SF Grand Wazoo]] and [[ASIN:B0000009SE Waka Jawaka]], both in 1972...were they \\"jazz rock\\" or \\"rock jazz?\\" It didn't matter...it was a brief period and \\"Over-nite Sensation\\" marked his return to largely vocal tracks with guitar solos. At the time, I remember being supremely disappointed with this one. I didn't think it had the raw power of [[ASIN:B0000009S9 Fillmore East]], [[ASIN:B0000009S8 Chunga's Revenge]] or [[ASIN:B0000009SD Just Another Band From L.A.]]...the 1970/71 Flo and Eddie albums. I saw this band at Boston Music Hall (opening act, Chuck Berry), and while the vocal side of the music was probably the most deliberately filthy songwriting of his entire career, Zappa WAILED on guitar. The Flo and Eddie band, to me, was the next logical step in \\"The Mothers of Invention,\\" as they were the ultimate bad-boy garage band. I enjoyed the two 1972 albums, but I was ready for some hardcore Mothers music when I tore the shrink-wrap from the \\"Over-nite Sensation\\" LP. Maybe I'd set the expectations bar too high, but nothing really grabbed me.<br /><br />Many of my fellow Amazon reviewers have written of the \\"commercial\\" nature of the songs, and I'm bit sure if that's what bothered me...maybe I just felt they were too \\"lightweight.\\" I liked \\"Montana\\" (who wouldn't?), but beyond that one song, I felt Frank could write better songs in his sleep.<br /><br />Then, over time, these songs popped up in FZ concerts and live albums. \\"Camarill Brillo\\" took on a new life as an intro to \\"Muffin Man\\" as Frank dragged out the \\"It was useless anymore\\" ending and the opening notes of \\"Muffin Man\\" came roaring in like Godzilla over Tokyo.<br /><br />\\"I'm the Slime,\\" \\"Dirty Love,\\" \\"Zomby Woof,\\" \\"Dinah-Moe Humm,\\" \\"Montana\\"...you'll find these tracks all over the \\"You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore\\" series, as well as elsewhere.<br /><br />The album won a new audience for Zappa, and while I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, the album sounds a lot better to my ears in 2012 than it did in 1973...almost four decades later. Much of that comes from the fact that the songs took on a new life in concert, and in almost every scenario, were vastly superior and more \\"edgy\\" than the versions recorded here.<br /><br />I still wouldn't call this one of Frank's \\"greatest\\" albums, but if you're at the point where you are collecting his works...and why wouldn't you be...this one should be on your list.
B00021HBGS|3.0|there are so many pieces to this, i don't know if they're all necessary, but it is kind of difficult to clean up. i find random pieces everywhere. they really don't stick to the tub that well, but my son has a good time playing with it. it just isn't very functional
B000NJVWU0|5.0|I was somewhat hesitant on buying this because after all, some analog CDs that are remastered only magnifies the background sound you hear on some older recordings.  Not so here.  The remastering really brought out everything...the instruments and vocals.  I really liked the CD sleeve notes, where Alan Parsons told about the process of recording and most times how more than one lead vocal is done before the right one surfaces.  On purpose, I did not listen to the added tracks, I wanted to relish the original ones.  I think twice about buying again CDs I already have but am really glad I did it on this one.  What could be better?  Why, SACD of course!  Comon Alan, give us a true treat......

0307120007|3.0|First, my 7-month-old daughter loves this book.  We read it to her every night and it´s very cool to see her grasping the new concepts one page at the time.  At first, she´d curl her fingers into the bunny´s fur, then later scratch Daddy´s face and so on and so forth until now she´s shaking the page to rattle the buttons and smacking the dolly´s ball with glee.  She really enjoys the different activities and thinks the book is great fun.<br /><br />However, I´m going to echo what others have said in that the binding is utter junk.  I´ve fixed it multiple times only to have all the pages come out yet again, slipping out of the comb over and over.  So I´ve finally come up with what I hope is a permanent solution.  You have to take the comb out completely and flip it around so that the the teeth are going counter-clockwise (i.e., pointing to the left).  Then you put all the teeth on the outside of the plastic scroll.  Lastly, you take a thin 3/4 of an inch piece of duct tape and tape them all down, creasing the tape into the sides of each tooth so it sticks.  I shouldn´t have to do this to make the book work, but there you have it.

B005QJZ5FA|3.0|I feel that when I have read professional reviews of Born to Die, they are reviewing the hype and persona of Del Rey as much, if not more, than her music. Born to Die is far from the perfect album, but it isn't a total disappointment either. Lana Del Rey's lyric writing is impressive and sometimes perplexing. When the album works, it works to great effect. 'Off to the Races' is probably the most exciting song to be released this year, and the hype surrounding 'Video Games' was well worth it. For those who enjoy the sound of the album, none of it is bad, but so much of the album repeats itself that there is usually a song with similar context done to a better effect. There are common adjectives, nouns, and phrases that make appearances throughout the album, but none of it actually seems to provide cohesion, and that may not even be the intent. The album hits a few sweet spots again with 'Radio' and 'Million Dollar Man', but then there are the clunky (but not unlistenable) tracks 'Diet Mountain Dew', 'National Anthem' and 'This is What Makes Us Girls'. Since I can't give a two and a half star review, I'll give three as it seems befitting of a worthy, if not entirely successful effort.

B005HP2J66|5.0|I appreciate all good reasons for sealing the cave against promiscuous tourism. This part of our species' patrimony deserves the greatest care and attention. At the same time, the value is nearly lost if it's not known and treasured by the widest possible audience. We all need to understand these magnificent works, even when we can't experience them ourselves, if only to ensure funding for their study and stewardship.<br /><br />Although you might fuss about some of the details of how it was done, adding a widely respected artist (Werner Herzog) to the research team oes a long way toward making the science and art of the glorious works available. Even if you ignore the value of a visual artist in understanding the visual artistry, Herzog brings these works to life for us. A few pieces benefit from interpretation, like the ones where contours of the rock walls contribute to the structure of the beasts depicted.<br /><br />Most of the wall paintings, however, stand on their own. They express as much today as they did thirty millenia back, whether or not they express just the un-knowable thoughts of our many-times ancestors. The grace, power, and precision in these works stands up to much what's been done in the last few hundred years. And, in a few cases, these ancient caves anticipate \\"modern\\" work. In particular, one cartoon of a running bull (auroch?) foreshadows DuChamp's \\"Nude Descending a Staircase.\\" It captures motion over time in a single still image the same way that modern painters did - seeing this, I hesitate to call the moderns 'innovators.'<br /><br />Whatever the ancients' motivations, and we may never know them, they left magnificent art. Seeing this movie humbled me, seeing for myself just how much connection there is from their ways of seeing and knowing to ours. After all these thousands of years and all these changes in our lives, their core humanity remains as vivid and wise as our own.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B005UKJX4E|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece, and should have won Best Picture. Happily it did win the Palm d'Or (Cannes has almost always been more privy than the Academy to what is actually the best picture in a given year) and the International Federation of Film Critics Best Film prize.<br /><br />No other movie has tried this blatantly to equate humankind's actions to the majesty of the universe. Malick argues many monumental things, but among them some of the more important statements emerge. The story does not happen on screen, in this movie. Not even its important punctuations do; what would traditionally be called the small moments in between, the repercussions, are what we see on screen. What does this mean? It means stories, and events, are no more important than their consequences, that every moment is as important as the moments we usually think of as important. On this note, what does he mean by cutting between these tiny fragments of life and the epic of evolution and the universe? He means, first of all, to remind us of where we live. Most people, I believe, don't remember this very often: they don't recognize the constant, insane scale of the universe they are in, and I don't just mean \\"you're a tiny dot in a vast universe.\\" I don't mean you are insignificant, and neither does Malick. I mean that you are very significant, you are one of the relative infinity of forces, and because of the nature of your existence, you tend to forget a vast majority of the other forces of which, in fact, you are a part, every single day. I mean that you probably haven't actually empathized (not sympathized) with a dinosaur before; but watching this, you might. Why, Malick asks you, do you need a traditional story to understand people, or moments, or sentiments? This is largely paralleling the story of Job, and going by that notion, Malick argues that what might be the most important part of your existence is your response, not your action. You are one force among many: how will you control your fate, when you can, how you can? These, among many many others, are the questions that Malick attempts to answer, with eye-gouging beauty and an endless boon of technical sophistication.<br /><br />The only, *only* thing I wanted less of was some (only SOME) of Jessica Chastain's character's few-phrase overlays of narration. Some of them were way over the top and unnecessary, even though the whole film is kind of based on being unabashedly emotional, which may be why Malick kept all of the lines he did. In contrast, some of her lines were perfect, and even necessary, as when she asks \\"Lord, Why? Where were you? Did you know what happened? Do you care?\\" This perfectly segues us into Malick's response, and the most astounding centerpiece of the movie, the evolutionary sequence, wrapping it all together. Beyond this, as a muse, as both an untouchable thing of stunning beauty and a housewife, Jessica Chastain fills the role perfectly. And besides, quibbling about this one bit is like quibbling with James Joyce that I didn't like some of his paragraphs of wordplay in the Lotos Eaters episode of \\"Ulysses.\\" It just doesn't matter in the scheme of the whole work.<br /><br />Many are bothered because they think this movie is pretentious. In modern society there is an epidemic of misplaced derision: people scorn pretension more often than they scorn mediocrity or even failure. Certainly, pretension has done less damage than the failure and mediocrity which is currently ravaging, but of course which always has ravaged, society. But here, as in many cases, pretension is hand in hand with insane talent. In fact, I would only call this pretentious to those without a thorough experience in the world of film, that is, without having seen thousands of past films, mostly, of course, the better films, but the bad ones too. Actually, this movie is not pretentious but unashamed, embarrassingly honest and indulgent.<br /><br />I should add that I am saying this as a 25 year old, not an old curmudgeon who is angry at the world.<br /><br />To those who wonder what I mean by film experience. For some of those who are saying they have this experience, I mean, sure, maybe you've seen plenty of \\"arthouse\\" and \\"indie\\" movies, but have you covered the decades and movements of varied types of film? Have you seen movies that make you rework your understanding of what a movie could be, that make you doubt your previous definition that a movie has to be a straightforward narrative of audio and image where the entire plot, easy-peasy, is put right up on the screen, and you don't need to do any work at all? That's one difference between book and film, even some of the best films don't make you do any of the work, don't require you to parse trough information, instead feeding it all to you. I don't mean they don't make you think--the Godfather, for example, will make you think, to varying degrees that depend on your intelligence, but it does not require you to think to figure it out. If you respond by saying that you don't think one should have to think hard to figure out a movie, I say: that is the kind of mind you have, or that is the decision you've made on how to use your mind, and it's not as rewarding, period. A little hard work, or even a lot of hard work, is worth it--art is not here merely to please you, it's also here to change you, if you want it to--people get spiteful, thinking they're being tricked, but believe me, Malick would not even begin to consider putting the time or effort into making this in order to trick you. The same goes for Ulysses, a book often accused of being 800 pages of BS. Would Joyce, undoubtedly a genius, but at the very least certainly no fool, spend over 7 years just to screw with readers? Returning to those who may or may not have \\"seen plenty of art films\\", &c: Have you taken the time to watch what astounding things people have done in the medium of film already, and what important changes and revolutionary techniques have been employed by, beginning very early on, Melies, Bunuel and Salvador Dali, Fritz Lang, von Stroheim, Godard, Truffaut, Kurosawa, Bergman, Ozu, Kubrick, Fassbiner, Herzog, Wong Kar Wai, Andrei Tarkovsky, Elem Klimov, and countless others? I am not discounting mainstream American directors-- I love Scorcese, Coppola, Peckinpah, Tarantino, Fincher, the Cohen Brothers, etc. etc. I'm just saying, a lot more than you might think has been done in film, and you should check it out before you try to make an informed decision, not to mention write a review, about unusual movies like this one that sneak into mainstream audiences who would never otherwise watch such a film. Of course, for plenty of people, the answer to my above question is yes you have seen these things, and I'm glad, but I would also bet my (tiny as it is) fortune on it that if you have seen these things, you like The Tree of Life.<br /><br />Malick has worked for decades, starting relatively simply with \\"Badlands\\" and \\"Days of Heaven\\" (relative to this movie and \\"The New World\\") and moving into the ether-- very deservedly so. Kubrick, who is I think ultimately the better filmmaker, made his magnum opus (the masterpiece of his many masterpieces) just over ten years into his career. Malick, in contrast, waited four decades. We could fairly say that Kubrick had much more exposure by actually continually making films, versus Malick, who let time and maturity do a lot of the work, and made films sporadically (although he seems to have returned to regularity [although, of course, this film seems like a career final film, if any film ever has]). What this contrast shows to me is the slightly higher level of raw talent in Kubrick. Still, knowing Malick, and what he has done in the past, it is very clear that he is not \\"trying hard\\" to make film-art-- it flows through him like poetry did through Keats. Which isn't to say that it flows and is produced without discipline or practice, but just that it is THERE, fully and truly, and that he masterfully harnesses it. Watch this movie, if you're ready, if you're interested in your life, and interested in the life of the universe. Which is your life too.iques have been employed by, beginning very early on, Melies, Bunuel and Salvador Dali, Fritz Lang, von Stroheim, Godard, Truffaut, Kurosawa, Bergman, Ozu, Kubrick, Fassbiner, Herzog, Wong Kar Wai, Andrei Tarkovsky, Elem Klimov, and countless others?

B00000IL67|5.0|I own every Alice Cooper album, and for this reason, I was hesitant about getting this box set because I figured I didn't need it. To be honest, I mainly got it just to complete my collection. But now that I have, I'm surprised by how much I've been listening to it: more than I've been listening to full studio albums.<br />There are at least 2 songs from every album through The Last Temptation. Some albums have 3,4, or 5 songs in this set. There are also 11 previously unreleased tracks on here. Some are just demos of various hits, but others are a few songs from before their first album, and before they were called Alice Cooper. There are also several songs he did for soundtracks that didn't appear on any of his studio albums; some of which were previously unreleased.<br />The box it comes in is really cool! And my favorite part of all is the book that it comes with! Some box sets have short books with very little info or pictures. This book is 80 pages and is jam packed with great pictures, about a 40 page biography, quotes from other celebreties, very in depth disography, information on every song's original release, and a paragraph on every single song from Alice, or another band member, giving some background information on each individual song. This is great for a new or old fan! If you're a new fan looking to get into Alice Cooper, definately get this!

145162445X|5.0|If you are interested in the origin and future fate of the Cosmos, I highly recommend this book. Yes, Lawrence Krauss is an atheist, but that does not take anything away from the fact that this is a fantastically written, scientific piece of work. He presents his case of why something can, and does, come from nothing in a fashion that most of us can comprehend. After reading this book, I very much look forward to the next few years when additional evidence either supports or detracts from his current theory. In any case, if you enjoy attaining more knowledge about the secrets of the universe (or universes), you will definitely enjoy this book.

Jobs's story, his import, his incredible quirks, difficulties, showmanship, and stunning industrial design genius is laid out crystal clear here.

0062060562|5.0|What a debut for Watson.  A compelling story, a protagonist one could really care about, a tension that underlies the story the entire time, and a great primer on the effects and implications of severe amnesia.<br /><br />Have already recommended it to others, and that is harder and harder to do over time.<br /><br />I'd look forward to his next book.

I saw them last summer and now can visualize the musicians and look forward to again seeing them when they come to my area.  I have most of the cd's the band has made, and this is a really good addition to the collection.  Their persussion group is just fabulous, and is particularly good on this disc.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have recommended this book to many And actually bought it for a few. I saw it first on Bill O'Reilly. The story is well written and easy to read. The enhanced version is necessary for those of who who do not understand all the acronyms and have never seen the ammunition and equipment. For the first time, I think I am beginning to understand how these men kill. But I will never know unless I am behind the scope. Must read for PATRIOTS.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This novel manages to combine brutality and humanity in a way that is illustrated beautifully. It took me a total of two days to read this book for the mere fact that I could not stop reading. I suggest this book because it seems so relevant to how society could become.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have looked at many protective covers for my Kindle Fire; this is the most well-made, by far.  The softer side of the cover makes it very flexible, yet sturdy enough to support the Kindle on a table or desk.  The pink color makes it easy to find in my pocketbook/carry-on luggage.  This was definitely money well spent!
B003R0MEZ4|4.0|I love how this series gives insight into the twisted minds of criminals.  Some situations are difficult to watch but the working out of the profiles is intriging.  Love how each member of the team has their own contribution and foibles.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This final book left me somewhat lost in feelings: unsatisfied, disappointed, questioning what was wrong in this book. The book has very good moments, the storyline is also good overall. What is frustrating is that minor adjustments only could have made it so much fulfilling. And if on top of it I had to pick a more major change, a rewrite of the part of the story when true action is required, could have made the 3rd book awesome as well. I loved the 2 first books. I literally ate the three books in a few days. And that makes me more frustrated with the 3rd book.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />---------------------SPOILERS TILL THE END----------------------<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The third book is missing emotional development and the big game when Katniss should get some kind of control over the situation. I think the book is pretty good till the point where she gets into a mission to get into the capitol. I loved the idea that each book has some kind of flavor of an actual hunger game, so when the book makes a parallel between Katniss' mission into the capitol and the hunger games, I was thrilled! I thought it was well done and was expecting the story to get hot in the heart of actions again, where Katniss would get free of direct political and higher strategy at last for a moment, and benefits from her previous games experience which would at last give her an edge back to the situation. But contrary to the other books which get promising and live up to the expectations and more, this one doesn't. The mission achieves absolutely NOTHING but faking action, killing some side characters quickly here and there, being useless as the rebels don't need them anyway. It does not even show reconnection between Peeta and Katniss. Granted that Katniss tries to reach out to him a few times, but it falls short and cold. Wasn't Peeta everything to her at the end of the third book? What a drawback. There is no trace of this in the 3rd book. The final pages have some good elements but the author doesn't develop them and keeps inspiring and satisfying away.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I do like the realistic side of the book, how the war preparations are being handled and how the developpment goes well above Katniss (to some extents, I mean it's not supposed to be only a war study separate from the hunger games is it). Just lovey dovey will definitely not have made it. I didn't want just a type of repetition of the two first books either. But realistic and tragic and negative isn't enough. In particular not after the 2 first hunger games books. If only the characters' connections and emotional developments did not disappear with the end of the 2nd book. Nothing connects the main characters anymore at all and we wonder if there ever was anything in fact. The author tries to pretend there are but it is not credible. That was just such a big blank.<br /><br />So I still give 3 stars because there are many good things in the book. But again, leave aside the capitol actions joke, it is so frustrating how even only just minor adjustments of the book could have made it so much better. So, Suzanne Collins, could you please review the \\"draft\\" and have an edition number 2? :) I admit I got so much into the books that somewhat I have this crazy hope that maybe the movies version of the hunger games will make things right with the last 3rd of the story. Only, when has a movie ever made a story better than the book?! So please, 2nd edition book :p

0307276902|1.0|I had the benefit of reading this long book after it had been revealed that it wasn't truly a memoir, but a \\"semi-fictional memoir\\".  Hmm...I'm pretty sure that  \\"semi-fictional\\" and \\"memoir\\" don't belong together, so let's call it what it is: fiction.    I was about 3 pages into the story when I had to put it down and vent.  I couldn't believe that anyone- nevermind millions of people- were sucked in by this over the top story.    It could have been a halfway decent fictional piece with a bit of tweaking and set in the early 70's, rather than early 90's.  But it wasn't, and it's not.    I'm not a fan of crude language, but I am not bothered by the odd four letter word, especially when it is crucial to character development.  This book was so full of foul language it was distracting.  I do believe that if all the questionable language was removed, this novel would have been reduced to little more than a short story.    My verdict: PASS ON IT  You should only read this book if you are a quick reader and interested in the story around the story.  There are too many compelling true memoirs and well written fiction novels to spend your time on a \\"semi-fictional memoir\\".    See more reviews at [...]

B006ZEDZNY|5.0|I absolutely loved this film. As I grow older and leave the 18-35 male demographic that eats up movies like G.I. Joe and Transformers I rather loved a movie that was based on a great concept, terrific acting and superb dialog. I have grown up watching Johnny Depp from 21 Jump Street to the Pirates series... what he brings to this film is impeccable timing and a look that no one else could have achieved. Like him or not, he nails this character. The rest of the acting is superb and the scenery is authentic and rich.<br /><br />If you are looking for great escape to the late 50s era Puerto Rico and entertained by a cast that brings Hunter's book to life perfectly, this is your film.

B0072GPPNC|5.0|Once in a while, a truly magnificent movie comes along. This is one of them. Like any great Spielberg film, War Horse is a roller coaster ride that will take its viewers from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other. Just like E.T. and Saving Private Ryan, this movie has the ability to make you laugh one minute and then put a lump in your throat the next. The imagery, musical score, and cinematography are second to none.<br />If you own a horse or love horses, this movie may be difficult to watch at times because it can be quite stirring. As difficult as some scenes are to sit through though, I'm grateful for them and their ability to expose the cruelty that mankind has inflicted on horses. In many ways, this movie seems to honor the contributions of the horse and the contributions of our soldiers. Best of all, it is one of the few movies that actually appreciates horses and portrays them as something other than veterans of the race track. The only other movies I can recall that attempt to accomplish this are The Black Stallion, Black Beauty, and Gallant Bess.<br />War Horse does an excellent job of exposing the many horrors of war that the soldiers and horses both faced. It has all the unique elements of World War I such as no mans land, poison gas, tanks, and machine guns. All of which were a novelty before World War I. Historically, this movie seems to be very accurate. Interestingly, this movie doesn't take sides in the war.  Through the eyes of Joey, we see humanity and cruelty in both alliances of the war, the Allies and the Central Powers.<br />Kudos, Mr. Spielberg for doing your homework, putting your heart into this endeavor, and delivering an exceptional movie!  This film does what all good movies should.  It gives us characters to care about, an involving story, it shows us a time and place that's hard to imagine, and it stirs something inside of us.  This is one of only three movies I've watched in the theater that received a standing ovation after its conclusion.<br />I would like to mention that I have indeed seen this film (three times) and although I do not own the blu-ray yet, I did pre-order it the first day Amazon began accepting pre-orders.  With that being said, I can't honestly comment on the extra features or menus that will be released on the disc.  Perhaps after I receive it,watch it,and go through all of the features, I'll update this review.its conclusion.<br />I would like to mention that I have indeed seen this film (three times) and although I do not own the blu-ray yet, I did pre-order it the first day Amazon began accepting pre-orders.

1594203334|5.0|Druckerman's story of parenting her children in Paris is compelling, thought-provoking and sometimes hilarious. Druckerman, an American, and her husband, a Brit, are outsiders struck by how  well-behaved Parisian children are. Here's Druckerman's take on how the French get their babies to sleep through the night (a technique she dubs The Pause), how they teach their kids to wait and entertain themselves long enough for parents to finish a phone conversation or a cup of coffee, ideas about speaking to babies (assume they understand you even at birth), having a happy marriage and sex life after children, how the French get their preschoolers to eat not just veggies but all sorts of cheese and fish and sit at the table through 4 or 5 courses (they encourage kids to try one bite of everything on the plate, among other things.) Apparently Parisian toddlers don't have temper tantrums, at least not in public!<br /><br />Druckerman's chapter, \\"It's me who decides,\\" apparently an expression French parents use often, is especially funny. She learns to corral her boisterous twin boys by changing her tone of voice, not yelling, when she says \\"No.\\" She also learns to use \\"the big eyes\\" expression.<br /><br />Not everything French looks rosy to Druckerman--the French apparently don't breastfeeding much and are hung up on rapid weight loss after giving birth. They also send their 6-year-olds on week-long school trips sans parents.<br /><br />As a new parent myself, I'd love to discuss this book with other parents. Not everything sounded like a great idea to me, but enough of the ideas were intriguing . I agree it's important to provide kids with manners and a gentle framework for living, so that they learn to behave kindly to others in the world and to deal with their own emotions. The whole goal of parenting, besides the obvious love you have for your child, is to help him or her grow up to be happy and independent and sociable. Druckerman's book aims to answer how the French dothat, in a way that makes life easier for both parents and children.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|My husband and I have appreciated so much the first three movies produced by Sherwood Baptist Church, and so we were really eager to see Courageous.  Before I could obtain a copy for us a friend loaned us his copy.  We watched it three times in three days.  What a blessing!  I ended up ordering one for each of our grown children as well as ourselves.  I wish that all fathers could see this film and take seriously the message it puts forth to them.  What a different country (and world) we, and our children, and our children's children, etc., could be living in. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about being a Godly parent and raising up Godly children to make a positive difference in this world.

This movie is about the politics in these firms, how they function, and how many of these people live their lives.

The decision making process is these characters follow is rather interesting.<br /><br />The movie is not fast paced, so if you are expecting to jump from one cut scene with someone yelling \\"sell\\" to another with someone yelling \\"buy\\" this is not your movie.

0553583182|5.0|Joseph Murphy, author of \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\", says that prayers are answered when our subconscious mind responds to the mental picture or thought in our mind, and that this \\"law of Belief\\" is the operating principle in all the religions of the world. According to Murphy, the gateway to health, happiness, security, and peace of mind is the subconscious mind, and likewise, it's also the path to liberation from poverty, failure, misery, lack, and frustration.<br /><br />  I can agree that my subconscious mind controls and governs many of my actions. I've allowed a lot of garbage to be dumped there over the years, from childhood experiences - falsities fed to me that I took as truth - to the brainwashing, consumerist messages pummeled into my head through television advertising and other media.<br /><br />  It would be wonderful if I could go in there with a flashlight and shovel and extract this malignant dross, but the fact that it's in my subconscious (below conscious) means it's hidden from me. It seems I can only wait until a pestilent thought surfaces like a leviathan from the depths in the form of some self-destructive behavior or bad habit, then seek to eradicate it. I guess making a fearless and moral inventory of myself is the closest tool I have to the flashlight and shovel, but the going is slow. It seems I'm only able to remove a layer of filth at a time.<br /><br />  Murphy says there's a window for depositing programming thoughts (prayers) into our subconscious minds: the hypnotic trance or the half-sleep state right before dozing off. I unwittingly practiced my own version of this after I was arrested. Every night when I closed my eyes until I fell asleep, I repeated, like a prayer-lullaby-mantra: \\"God please help me, God please help me, God please help me...\\" I did that every night for more than a year, until it became automatic when I closed my eyes.<br /><br />  Did it work? Did He help me? Yeah.<br /><br />Written by David A. Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Let me start off by saying this: I have not read Jane Eyre, nor have I particularly enjoyed the other two adaptations that I have seen.<br /><br />This version finally made me think, \\"now I want to read Jane Eyre and keep this and watch it again\\"  I saw the adaptation that came out last year a few months ago and I thought it was okay. Good acting, but again, not a story that I loved and maybe I came in a bit prejudice because I feel like there could have been better chemistry and more of Mr. Rochester.  To that film's credit, though, it did make me more curious about other adaptations, and give me a bit of hope that I just may have failed to see the best version of this story out there.<br /><br />I am so glad that I gave this movie a chance!  I thought the acting was superb and the story just drew me in. Toby Stephens, as far as I am concerned, is Mr. Rochester and I loved all the scenes with him.  I like that he was shown a lot and the chemistry was appropriate.  Ruth Wilson was an excellent Jane and I really liked the relationship these two established.  THe whole story is very beautifully portrayed.<br /><br />Jane Eyre is waiting to be read on my Kindle, now, and I also intend on watching the 80's version with Timothy Dalton very soon, but this one stands thus far as my favorite and it finally sparked an interest in the story.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Very simple yet fun. Get way to kill time. My 10 yr old daughter also loves this game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is.one of the best games on the amazon app store. it works.quite well on the kindle fire. well worth a buck.
B0072OFM28|5.0|[[ASIN:B0072OFM28 Spartacus: Vengeance - The Complete Second Season]]Finally, the new spartacus has established himself! Episode 5 is darn near worthy to a season-ending episode. The ending of this episode has made me so glad that only a week will pass before I get to see what happens next. Sad that rapist got killed.That should have been saved for Naveia. Spartacus going to save Crixus and the crew will go down as one of the 3 best episodes ever! To all of the new Spartacus haters, RECOGNIZE!!!!! This episode finally made him SPARTACUS!!!! Shout-out to his new babe,a true ride-or-die chick!!!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Radiant is a Space invaders-like game, but with a fun upgrade system and (intentionally?) badly translated dialog. The game shoots automatically, but you'll easily get used to that. This is so totally worth the asking price.
B002VWNID6|5.0|The plot is extremely predictable (But, its Robin Hood everyone knows this story), with several one liner zingers. But, for the type of movie it is I would say it is a fun movie to watch with family and friends on a Saturday night.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I just downloaded the game, and every time I try to open the app. It just force closes. Looks like a good game, but the deva need to fix it so it works on the phones &amp; not just the tablets. Everything I've ever downloaded on this phone has worked, except this &amp; one other app. The other app that didn't work was fixed by the Dev &amp; has worked ever since. So this game isn't coded properly for the EVO 4G.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app the games are really fun download this app and have tuns of fun its a great way to entertain your Kids too so download this app
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far do good, I have not been playing very long but I have played more than once and I have not uninstallled
0385344228|4.0|Personally I liked the book a lot but I kept thinking and waiting for the most obvious question the parents should have asked their son. \\"Did you kill your classmate Jacob?\\" Am I the only reader who while reading this book and trying to put a face to their defense lawyer (Jonathan) picture the famous real life defense lawyer Gerry Spence? Here is a link to his picture [...]  Anyways the book is worth the read and with a few twists and turns that are sure to keep the reader in suspense and motivated to keep on reading.
0646497855|4.0|it's agreat book<br />it help you alot, target band the perfect book to study for the exam<br />i think you should buy one, you will not be sad ;)
B0071MV540|3.0|Well I thought the movie lived up to expectations.<br /><br />A comedy twist on getting back at a Bernie Madoff type schemer.  I think that the story leaves a little bit to be desired (they didn't close the movie very well), but what did you think you would get?<br /><br />I laughed out loud several times, I felt for the characters, and I was entertained.<br /><br />Don't expect an Oscar-worthy performance, but if you want some cheap laughs, it's not a bad choice.
0375428232|5.0|This book has really helped in making this bearable. I have really put it to good use. I recommend it to anybody.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a blast (pun intended). My only complaint is when you exit and come back later to continue it doesn't save your building repair state. You are forced to play a round with your buildings un-repaired. This is problematic the further you get as you have less room for error. Very fun and very well done other than that.
B000O14VAU|5.0|The acting is great and the story was well written, I can't say anything bad about this movie.  There is plenty of action and good strong characters in this movie.

B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I love the Mahjong Deluxe game, but it shuts down in the middle of solving a puzzle about every other game.  Very frustrating.  If this was fixed I would recommend to others.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is terrific for so many different aspects of daily life. I use it for a journal, taking notes at work, both in meetings and on the sales floor (I am a retail manager), when doing Biblical study, as a digital filing cabinet for my bills, and an archive of my kids' artwork and activities - by scannibg them in or taking photos of them. There really is no end to the different uses of evernote. Thanks for a great product!

B006HGXGWU|4.0|Curtis is an ordinary guy, living his ordinary life with his wife Samantha, and their hearing impared daughter, Hannah. His life changes dramatically when a series of vivid, and terrifying dreams begin to disturb his nights.  Curtis comes to believe they are not just dreams, but a warning that something bad is coming. This feeling becomes an obsession as he prepares for the Apocalypse that is surely descending upon them. Curtis begins to enlarge and supply his small tornado shelter, believing this shelter will ensure his family's survival. Everyone notices his strange behavior, and his obcession with his building project. His mother had been diagnosed with paranoid delusions, and soon, not only his family, but Curtis himself begins to fear he has inherited her illness. The acting alone makes this a movie worth seeing.  Michael Shannon as Curtis, and Jessica Chastain as Samantha are both exceptional at pulling you into their lives. You feel Curtis' terror as his life begins to unravel, and the pain Samantha experiences, watching her husband fall into madness. This is one movie not to be missed. 4 1/2 stars.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|Got this from a friend for my birthday. I'd never heard of these guys (this guy?) before. From what I've read, all the reviews here are accurate -- good and bad. This is some of the richest, most surprising folk-pop I've heard in years, which is also to say it's slow, super-understated, and weird. Think Sigur Ros but with multi-tracked vocals that are still incomprehensible even though they're not in a made-up language, and you've got an idea. Not depressing, but contemplative as all get-out.<br /><br />If you're looking for a rock album, or something upbeat, this ain't it. If you're looking for something that will make you say, \\"What the hell was that?!\\" in confusion and curiosity, give this a go.<br /><br />(Though I could do without the last track, which sounds like Steve Winwood trying to revive his career on an indie label.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|okay this is the best game like ever get it's!! so if you don't get it well its awesome bye.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so cool that you unlock the games instead of having them right away. its amazing its free I love this game
B000TGCR38|5.0|This tale involves a jewish woman who is running from the Nazis. While she is running, we find that she joins the resistance and falls in love with a german officer. So, she is set on a roller coaster life story, one that almost ends tragically, Instead, it  only ends badly for her in the end because she stills lives. She just does not live like she had hoped. The acting is great, the story is good, and shot very well. Very entertaining and very moving. Get it and watch.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a sturdy protective case for the Kindle Fire. I was sceptical about the stand, but it does work fine as long as it is on a flat surface and the Fire is touched gently. It has some weight to it but with the Fire being a bit heavy to start with, it isn't noticable. I wish it came in colors though-black is so...boring!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I thought it was pretty good overall. could've bbeen better though. actually, it was damn good. I recommend this to everyone!
B0018SWA56|5.0|Such an amazing book. I never read Something Borrowed, but after seeing the movie, I was determined to follow up and read Something Blue. It is written so well, and it's amazing what Giffin does as far as developing a previously despicable character into someone the reader would want to be friends with. I can't wait to read another Giffin book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it. tons of fun games even if their a little easy unlocking all the games is awesome. I deffinitly recommend this app

B003PBB4ME|5.0|Wow, after reading some of the negative reviews on here I was hesitant to order this for my new Vixia camera. I especially liked the video review from someone who obviously has no idea what to do with this item (or had some serious camera issues) Bottom line first - I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and love the X-Grip!<br /><br />First off, after unboxing my new camera and all of the gear that came with it, I just had to see if my camera would swivel loosely around on the X-Grip like the guy in the video review. Guess what? An eighth of a turn past snug on the mounting bolt and nothing short of a forceful twist of the camera would shake this thing loose. I flipped it,shook it, twisted it, and swung it around like a madman and my camera remained precisely where I had positioned it.<br /><br />As for those who are complaining that the X-Grip cannot be attached to a tripod - double check the backside of the camera mounting thumbscrew. If yours is like mine, it took a few minutes to notice but it is double threaded, meaning that your tripod shoe will attach here easily.<br /><br />With a little ingenuity I set my X-Grip up to carry not only the camera, but 3-4 other accessories that have shoe mounts as well. Cameras are easy, everything is standard 1/4X20 thread! Most of my accessories (lights, microphone, etc) came with mounting bars and thumbscrews designed to attach to the camera's single, threaded hole in the bottom. Well, since this hole was occupied by the X-Grip, I simply mounted one of the bars to the top portion of the X-Grip with a 1/4X20 bolt and added 3 of the thumbscrew/shoe mounts to that - plus the one included on the X-Grip. Now my X-Grip, if needed, can be a handheld or tripod mounted \\"all in one\\" studio.<br /><br />The uses of the X-Grip are limited only by your imagination and ability to think outside of the box. This thing is crazy versatile and, despite being made of that evil \\"plastic\\" stuff, seems remarkably durable. Of course you could just mount your camera on it and use it like it was intended, but where's the fun in that? If you are a little more adventurous with your video camera than just holding it up by your face and shooting from one angle than get this thing - you'll be glad you did. I sure was!ust mount your camera on it and use it like it was intended, but where's the fun in that? If you are a little more adventurous with your video camera than just holding it up by your face and shooting from one angle than get this thing - you'll be glad you did. I sure was!

B004ECDNJU|2.0|I don't really see what is fun about this game.  It is not complicated or anything, its just boring.  Honestly don't bother with this app, there are way better ones that are way more fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a lot of fun and easy to use. I am really enjoying it. have Bern playing on kindle fire. Most games are pretty hard though!!

0307949486|5.0|This is the first time I am reading a book from Stieg Larsson. So far I am enjoying the first book the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br />My sister recommended me to read the books. I bought all 3 books and would recommend more people to read them. Once you start it is<br />sleeping around 2am even though you want to continue reading.<br />Very glad I purchased them.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|A must read. If you love the Sci-fi genre, you will be amazed how many things in current popular television and books seem to have drawn inspiration from the Dune series.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Retro, more fun than the original. hard, but not TOO hard. nice GFX and music. Also, Superman75 is a tool.
1423140591|5.0|perfect, amazing, exiting.<br />can not wait for the next!<br />Great for readers of all ages,<br />but if you don't have lodes of time on your hands, and you have yet to read any of the the \\"Hero's of Olympus\\" DO NOT READ THIS.<br />It is WAY to engaging.
0545265355|5.0|I think this trilogy is a great way to purchase the series.  I bought these for my daughter for her school reading. Box arrived in wonderful condition.  Set is in plastic wrap so no scratches, rips, etc.  Fast shipping!

0062112430|5.0|\\"Everyone is asleep. They've been asleep for years. You seemed...awake.\\"*<br /><br />Lena cannot wait to be cured when she turns eighteen. She doesn't want to be affected by amor deliria nervousa, to become infected by love. But when her best friend, Hana, sparks something inside of her with a few rebellious words, Lena becomes more questioning and aware of her life. And once she begins associating with Alex, a young man she shouldn't be befriending, everything changes. The day she once counted down to is fast approaching, only Lena isn't so sure she wants to be cured anymore.<br /><br />In Delirium, Lauren Oliver introduces Lena and her society in such a way that you can't help but to feel as though you're looking in on a very different yet realistic life. I liked this novel the first time I read it, but fell in love with the story even more after rereading it. This novel really is more stunning than I can convey. The beginning is slowly paced, yes, but it sets the groundwork and helps show the changes Lena goes through more clearly. With a heart-aching romance at the core of Delirium, Oliver delivers an astounding story filled with love, loss, and more than you can even dream of.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Love is a disease? Genius. The ending left me in complete shock**. Alex and Lena's romance was sweet and endearing. Side characters, like Hana and Grace, were nicely written. Lena's character growth was amazing, too. The epigraphs for each chapter gave a more complete view of Lena's society, and I enjoyed reading them. Oliver's writing is as stunning as ever in Delirium, and this is simply a story that must be read.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: Slow pacing took a bit of time to adjust to, but it's worth it. And the ending! Such torture. Also, yes, some aspects are predictable, but trust me when I say there are a few surprises.<br /><br />* spoken by the oh so lovely Alex, on pg. 230<br />** I'm rarely shocked, yet this ending rendered me speechless.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is by far the best logical puzzle game that I've ever bought. if I had payed triple it still would have been money well spent. the graphics are great and unlike many apps I currently have, quell does not cause my kindle fire to freeze. this game is very addicting and does not cause me to pull my hair out in frustration like games such as unblocked it. when you mess up its easy to start over and try a different route. many boards and many hours of fun. I highly recommend this app.
B0019NB9A2|2.0|Saw this movie at the theater when it was released. I was about 13 years old at the time and thought it was the second best movie I had ever seen (Around The World In 80 Days being number 1). Since then I have owned it on Laser Disc but will not add it to my Bluray collection because of the HOAKY ARTIFICIAL SOUNDS. When they remake it and put in some REAL music, I will buy (but I'm not holding my breath).
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My Kindle Fire was a birthday gift so the first thing I said is that I needed a good case..after hours of reading reviews and pictures...I found the case I wanted. I ordered it on a Monday and got it Tuesday morning and I couldn't be happier! My Kindle fits perfect and the product does what it says. I just may order another Color besides the pink I already have. Five stars all the way!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i think this is a extremely addictive game i would play all day. think it is the smartist think that u can pick ur background and cards.
0553801473|5.0|There are many different types of readers out there, but when it comes to \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" you can separate readers into at least 2 camps. There are those who have enjoyed the world Martin has created, but want resolution of the various story-lines and plots and then there are those who love Martin's world and are in no hurry for anything to end. I think this is why the reviews for \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" are so varied.<br /><br />This may have been my favorite book in the series, I felt like nearly every chapter was strong and showed me parts of Martin's world that I wanted to see. I continue to be impressed with Martin's ability to turn characters I either don't care for or don't care about into characters I can't wait to read again. I totally understand the perspective of those readers out there that just want \\"to know what happens\\", but if you are as interested in Slaver's Bay or Braavos as you are in Westeros then this will be a great book for you.<br /><br />After all, we are 5,000 pages in now, don't we all realize that \\"The Game of Thrones\\" doesn't really ever end? The Kings and Queens, Lords and Ladies, and slaves and masters will continue to fight and plot long after George finishes telling his story. I for one will keep reading \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" as long as George keeps writing. I can't wait for the next book, let's hope the wait isn't as long as it was for this one.
0439023513|4.0|I read all three books in less than a week after work, breaks, on the weekends.  These books grip you from the first page of HG thru the end of MJ and don't let go.  I would end one chapter and have to keep reading to find out what happens next.  I saw the movie previews (get chills and tear up just watching those, and can hardly wait for the movie to come out March 23rd), and also found out my 13 year old son was reading it for his English class.<br /><br />I read somewhere that they plan on making this book into two movies, a total of 4 movies for this trilogy of books, and that Suzanne Collins is really working with the filmmakers on this.  I really hope we get more details in the ending than what was very rushed at the end of this book.  I've read quite a few bad reviews for this  book, like people were hoping for more from this ending.<br /><br />****SPOILERS***<br />Now I give the first 2 books 5 stars and this one 4 because I thought the ending was very rushed, especially the ending.  MJ is a much darker, sadder, PTSD POV book. We get to know more of the supporting characters a little more.  Katniss has been such a strong heroine for the first two books, and in this one we see her breaking down.  In HG, she fights to save her sister's life and her own.  Then, in CF, her focus is saving Peeta.  In this book, she is trying to hold it all together to save all the people she loves, and it seems like she just keeps taking a beating from all sides.  She does love Peeta, she thinks she is doing what she can to save him and then breaks down, realizing that the promos she keeps putting on, are only killing him more and more.  That was such a powerful moment, seeing this strong heroine just break down, knowing that the one person who deserves to be alive because of his goodness, is the one person the Capital is hell bent on using against her.  I am glad to see that she ends up with Peeta.  Gale may have been her friend, hunting partner, but he did not go thru the trauma that Peeta suffered along with her.  Taking human life to save your own, as pawns of Capitol's/Panem's cruel \\"circus\\" game.  War is hell.  This book is about the final stages of a war that has been coming for years.  I come from a military family and have seen what the effects of war does to the soldiers coming home, & the stress it puts on the rest of the families.  We expect our soldiers to go from killing others for our country's cause, and then to come back and try to be normal again in a place that forbids what you just did to another country's people.  I like that this book shows the PTSD on all the Hunger Games Victors' characters.  Haymitch drinks the pain away, other tributes have turned to drugs, some have just gone nuts.  We see more of Katniss unraveling this time with the effects that her killing of others has on her.  We see the veil of smoke/facade that the Capitol has put up to distract its people from what really goes on outside of the capitol.  We see how reality TV is not really real, just used for entertainment to distract us from the atrocities of what people really go through in their daily lives and in war.<br /><br />After a person has been through all Katniss has been through at her age, 16-17 years old, (not even our soldier's fighting age, yet), you might be a little, if not a lot, dead inside too.  She volunteers to save her sister, and then in the end, her sister, the one person she volunteers to get into this mess for, to protect her, is dead.  Feeling used for her government's & rebellion's agendas.  Would you want to have a child or husband if that was all you had hope for, you and your children possibly being drawn into this game of death for everyone to watch on big TV screens.  I believe she has burn scars and matted hair after all is said and done in this book.  Only when she knows that the arenas are gone for good and she herself heals physically and mentally, can she finally give herself to Peeta and the idea of having children.<br /><br />This book may be gory and violent, but it is realistic, I think.  Look at the Nazi Germany.the Holocaust, Korea, Africa, Communist Russia, Middle East. . . . .etc. . . .  Teenagers at 18 get sent to war, albeit voluntarily at this time, but that could always change.  Happened in Vietnam where kids were forced into a cause they did not believe in.  With all of our technology that we have nowadays,  it could become a possiblity.  It is a cautionary tale in my opinion, that if we don't watch our complacency, and continue to question our government, leaders, teachers, etc.,keep our checks and balances in place.  (Just because they are adults, doesn't mean they are always right), that we could one day be headed down this road.  It is why we need to be involved.<br /><br />Overall, this may seem to others, a sad, tragic, unwanted end to the trilogy, but the author does give us a glimmer of hope at the end.  It is realistic, but I just feel the ending was too rushed, therefore I take 1 star off.  I truly hope the movies do this trilogy justice.  It seems like they have a great cast for it.  After seeing Jennifer Lawrence skin a squirrel in Winter's Bone, and feed  and care for her family, I think she is perfectly cast for Katniss.  Woody Harrelson: totally see him in Haymitch role.  Excited to see who they cast for the previous Hunger Games Tributes/Victors in Catching Fire.  Can't wait. . . . . . . .

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This fan is HUGE. The first time I took it out I couldn't believe my eyes. This thing is easily two of the included cpu fans that come with the i5-2500k. Which I believe is what makes it so quiet. I can barely even hear the fan at all. The CD drive that I bought is louder than this thing. It keeps my CPU at about 28C-31C when I'm not playing a game so it's rather cool. I'll have to check how  cool it keeps my i5 when I load up BF3 and play it for a bit. Overall, this is an exceptional CPU cooler for the price. Recommended buy for sure.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|For fans of Myst style games The Lost City won't disappoint.  Nice graphics, appropriately contrived premise, and puzzles that won't frustrate you.  The game struck just the right balance of being challenging enough to engage but still relaxing to play.

0307592731|5.0|The author has laid her personal life open for the reader. I could not be so open. Given that, you walk the trail with Cheryl from the beginning to the end.  Anyone who has done any hiking knows that it has a monotony that is maddening.  There is also such beauty being out in the wilderness away from civilization, that makes us realize we are not the center of the universe.  Tie this all up with spending a lot of this time alone and you have a psychological journey in the making.<br /><br />Cheryl had a rough childhood and a rougher young adulthood losing her Mother to cancer at 45 when she was in her 20s.  Her family afterwards, despite Cheryl's attempts to keep them together, wandered their separate ways and she did not deal with this well.  So much so, she pushed her husband away, divorcing him soon before she started her hike.<br />Inspired by a pamphlet of the Pacific Coast Trail; she latched onto a \\"spirit walk\\" of sorts to understand what the next stage in her life should be.  Expecting answers she learned the questions and in time became who she once was.  However as you can see while reading each mile brought up memories that she had to process and in a sense decide how she was going to deal with each aspect of her life relative to these events.<br /><br />This was a phenomenal book.  Very well written and real. She captures the camaraderie of other hikers and personalities of the people she meets around in a genuine fashion, which makes them easy to imagine.  Having had a friend attempt the Appalachian trail (the eastern version of the PCT) and reading this book, I'm energized to consider something like this myself someday.  Wished I did it when I was younger.<br /><br /> I was startled at the end to realize the time frame of the journey, given the immediacy of the writing. I plan on looking into her other books. She seems a great writer with loads of potential.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Excellent movie, product and service.  What else can I say?  I was worth the wait and also it pays to buy new sometimes.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|When surprised with my Kindle Fire as a gift, one of the first thoughts that crossed my mind was \\"find a good case\\", such an expensive piece of tech needs good protection. I was worried when I decided to start looking since I've seen cases that provide good protection but are big and bulky. The ones that look nice seem to have too much padding and are just too much to hold, but the alternative seems to be sacrificing the amount of protection provided.<br /><br />After becoming aware of this case and watching the video demo I decided to spend the money on it. I saw that it was light, provided ample protection, and was form fitted to the Kindle Fire (I hate cases that put elastic bands over the screen).<br /><br />The case is everything I thought it would be. It is light, provides enough protection (for someone who lives a normal life), the case snaps to the sides of the Fire so NOTHING covers ANY part of the screen. When you are reading a book the front cover folds behind the Fire and you can use the elastic band to hold it there. This makes it feel like your not holding anything but your Fire because the case is so streamline. This is possibly the best aspect of the case, you don't even notice it!<br /><br />The only negative about the case is the makeshift stand that the front cover folds into. It is not of the highest quality and only works on level ground. If you get this case planning on using the stand often, you might want to reconsider that decision and get one that has a better stand design. This does not impact my impression of the case since I don't use it often (only when I'm eating :D ).<br /><br />I am so pleased with this case that I will be bragging on it every chance I get.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I ride Chicago's public transit (el train) everyday and wanted something to disguise my Kindle Fire. This is perfect.  It looks like a simple leather bound book, a very nice leather bound book at that!  Worth the price!

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its definately addicting, though some of the controls in some of the games are slow to responding. overall its fun! for those that are extremely competitive, it will keep u busy.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|And read some of the reviews here.  I got the set Friday and just finished Deathly Hallows Part 2.  I do not understand what people are complaining about.  The movies are LOADED with special features, interviews and deleted scenes, etc.  The blu ray hi def on these films is simply stunning. Crystal clear sound.  You really cannot go wrong with this set.  All 8 films for a good price.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I got exactly what I had hoped for.  I highly recommend this set.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I use this app all the time, but I wish you didn't need Wifi. Even with that I do find it useful.
0374531269|5.0|I am still reading this book. It is truly intense, thought provoking, and not for the faint of heart. It brings to light a true life tale of tragedy, and redemption, about an unfortunate topic that we should all be made aware of. It also reminds us to not be judgemental of those whose path we have not walked upon.

B00149C8BK|5.0|My sons (ages 9 and 7) recently watched a clip of Michael Jackson performance at the \\"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever\\" TV broadcast (March 25, 1983 for those who watched it 29 years ago). My sons were mesmerized.<br /><br />I purchased the MP3 album and downloaded it to my Amazon cloud drive. I then loaded a Michael Jackson playlist on their MP3 players that also included [[ASIN:B0013D6LEM Thriller]], the best-selling album of all time. I'm pleased with both purchases.<br /><br />I'm having a lot of fun experiencing the magic again through my children. Although they were born before Jackson died, they had never experienced his music.<br /><br />This is an excellent value: 18 hit tracks for less than $8. The album savings are $15.23 compared to buying all songs individually. \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\" are duplicates from the [[ASIN:B0013D6LEM Thriller]] album. Regardless, with both albums I have 24 songs and only three duplicates for less than $13.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />BTW: I also recommend signing up for Amazon's Cloud Drive - a great way to buy and store your music.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion is a great app! If you don't already have it you need to get it!! I had this app for my blackberry but it is so much better on my Kindle Fire!!!!!

1569765677|5.0|This is well written and worth the time and money I put into it.  It's the best book I've read in years and it's well done.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Although I was quite skeptical at first, and I found myself having a hard time continuing to read the first chapter, but as I continued, the story got fantastic.  It really kept my attention and desire to keep reading.  I liked the way that each chapter was from a different character's point-of-view.  It has been awhile since I've read a book by Nicholas Sparks but I definitely  remember why I've always said that Nicholas Sparks has always been my favorite author.  I would definitely recommend this book to others!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Obviously I wasn't expecting a whole bunch since the case was pretty cheap, but I did get a good buy for my money. My only issue comes with the screen protector. Once there's a bubble under there, the little \\"squeegee\\" thing isn't really that helpful. Because of this, I have a mini bubble dead center on my phone, but that came from me putting it on oddly. But very cute case, and seems good for daily use.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app.  There are so many features and it is free!  Love it!  I would ad one thing if I could though, a way to get definitions smiliar to how it is done with kindle fire books (holding the word).<br />The best Bible out there.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I was so excited to see this as the FAOTD this morning!  My husband &amp; I love this game and have had this game on his past 2 smartphones, HTC Hero &amp; Motorola Photon.  When I got my Kindle Fire, I looked forward to this game in HD on a bigger screen!  And it was finally the FAOTD!!  It looks amazing and contrary to previous reviews, nothing is cut off on the screen and performance is great!!  Thanks, Amazon for picking a great app today!!!

B004WCTLNY|4.0|This movie is probably not for everyone, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt as though the movie was never slow. The intrigue of trying to figure out the premise of the movie and how their world works, kept my attention for the entire time.<br /><br />The ending was not 100% satisfying, but it fits the rest of the movie, as well as the 4 stars that I gave it. The acting is OK, and the action in the movie is realistic (i.e. not full of crazy special effects).<br /><br />I would consider this movie as a romance-thriller, and for that genre it was pretty good. I usually prefer comedies, but I still enjoyed The Adjustment Bureau. I would recommend this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You want something special to read during vacation? This book is it! It's not your run of the mill story for a home read! My husband read it first and recommended it to me. (I'm hijacking his account here.) It's been a long time since I've been this enthralled with a plot--so different and imaginative. I couldn't put it down! I started reading it on the plane and opted for three days (until I was done) to sit by the pool, \\"book\\" in hand rather than go out of the resort sightseeing. I had to know what happened next!! You feel like you are part of the story and in that silo with them. What an adventure! Just when I thought I had the plot figured out (which I always try to do before the story is over) it surprised me, again and again! Wow! Can't wait for more Wool! Please hurry with the next installment Mr. Howley!! I will have to schedule another vacation to read it!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|looks like a fun game...but i cant play it! starts and runs fine, but doesnt give me an option to actually play the game. only goes as far as the menu.

B00005ATZT|4.0|I remember when this film came out and was wondering how it would compare to the TV series of the Sixties.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimball who has been tried and convicted for killing his wife.  But he didn't do it!  Through an accident, he escapes and Federal marshal Girard goes after him, played seriously by Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />TV versus Movie!<br /><br />On TV it was a continuing series with Kimball disguising himself and avoiding Girard, going through various areas where he would use his medical knowledge to help others and became a master of disguise while he was at it.  Girard was obsessed when others gave up.<br /><br />The film has some of these elements, but seems more concerned with medical malpractice and how some doctors can go crooked.  This was the good part.  And Tommy Lee, though plays it in a wisecracking way, plays a pretty good cop.<br /><br />There were some pretty farfetched scenes:  Jumping off a waterfall would kill a normal man but not Richard Kimball!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Action and adventure, though Girard is not as obsessive as the TV series, the crooked medical men hiding behind their reputations is intense.<br /><br />Check out the TV series:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000Q6GUSE The Fugitive: Season One, Vol. 1]]
B006ON41FC|3.0|Me and my brothers play it a lot. My mom decided to even get it on her phone. Personally you won't have buyer's remorse!
1609611543|4.0|I was interested in reading Dr. Davis's book \\"Wheat Belly\\" because I have lived with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) for thirty years. I came to my own realization that wheat products tend to trigger an attack, so I avoided wheat, for the most part, although not absolutely. I was fascinated by the first few chapters where Dr. Davis in very understandable terms gives the history of wheat and why the current plants are completely different than their ancient origins. He also explains how our diets have changed over the years and gives a reasonable correlation between diet and obesity. However, I did believe that some of the other health problems that may be associated with wheat consumption like: schizophrenia, autism, lupus, seizures, and dementia were a bit an overreach especially based on anecdotal information. I'm not a doctor or scientist, so I can't say with certainty, but it seems logical, that unless there is more specific research, it would be difficult to reach a definite conclusion without more evidence to support. I do not believe that eliminating wheat will be the miracle cure for all ills or weight loss. I think that it is also very difficult to adhere to, but if you feel better as a result of trying it, then you really haven't lost anything. I think Dr. Davis does an excellent job of writing a common-sense approach to reevaluating your diet making a case for at least giving wheat elimination a try. I would recommend it especially if you have IBS and haven't tried eliminating wheat/gluten as a trigger.

B0061QD82E|3.0|I won't say anything about the film itself. It's a Disney classic, you will either love it or not. I have some issues with the film in terms of pace and storyline, but as a film I would give it perhaps the same score. I simply thought it was OK. Besides this, the Blu-ray transfer has proven to be a bit controversial. Is the Tramp some various shades of brown throughout the film? Yes. Is there an issue with the sound quality? Yes. This being the biggest deterrant. What I mean is that throughout the film you may notice a hissing sound in the background as background music or dialogue is going on, almost sounding like your speakers are simply too loud and slightly rattling. I initially thought the problem was my television, as I own a thin flat-panel, but even with the volume lowered, the hiss was still apparaent. This I attribute to the age of the film print the production team must have been working with. This being such an old film, perhaps contains these hissing sounds and could not have been reworked out of the film, hence during music and dialogue (or when there's a high enough sound coming from the movie), this hiss will continue. I suggest you just try and ignore it. Now the movie is presented in widescreen format. A couple of reviewers are complaining that this is not the original Cinemscope widescreen format as seen in movie theaters way back when. Perhaps not, but what this movie is NOT is a standard \\"set-for-tv-movie\\" box aspect ratio. Any casual viewer will not notice anything but the great digital transfer put onto Blu-ray; lines are sharp and colors are as vibrant as they can be. As an animated feature of this many years old, this movie is a joy to look at. As for all the naysayers, don't hold your breath for Disney to rework the film AGAIN in order to preserve every single exact color and whatever original aspect ratio of yesteryear, it's not going to happen. So just be happy with the transfer the way it is now, because along with the great picture, handful of special features, and usual pristine Disney presentation and packaging, this movie is a must-have for any Disney fan. I just really wish they could have done something about that sound problem.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Sadly force closes every time so I can't even play it. I was pretty excited to try it out but no dice.
B002BWP49M|3.0|After watching this installment of the Twilight series I thought it was ok but something seemed to be missing. I then listened to the audio book and realized why. There is so much that was not included from the first part of the book that the film seemed too condensed. Also most of the narative of the book is mental discription rather than event driven (the first part of the book that is) they needed to a better job of showing that.<br /><br />The second film will be a bigger challenge as it is more complex than the beginning. I just hope they don't leave out too much again.
0762434279|1.0|This isn't what I expected.  Somehow I missed the words (Miniature Edition) in the product description when I ordered this item.  I never saw a book this small in my life or at least took notice of them.  So if you're looking for a pocket reference, this is it.  If your a serious student, then beware this isn't for you.
0743219619|5.0|While Commander Adam Dalgleish is recuperating from health issues and questioning his future as a police officer, he receives a letter from Father Michael Baddeley, a priest he hasn't seen in twenty years. The priest requests that Dalgleish come see him at Toynton Grange, a private home for young, severely disabled people, which is a fair distance away. The only reason Father Baddeley gives for his request is that it's in a professional capacity. By the time Dalgleish arrives several days later, the elderly priest has died from heart failure. Dalgleish stays on at Father Baddeley's cottage to sort through the books bequeathed to him; however, during his stay two more deaths occur. Neither appears to be homicide and, given Dalgleish's physical health--not to mention state of mind--he's not all that interested in learning more. But things are said, inconsistencies noted, and Dalgleish is slowly drawn into solving a devious puzzle.<br /><br />The Black Tower is a great example of James's trademark talent for detailed narrative, carefully revealed plots, and isolated settings that provide as much of an ominous tone as the unhappy suspects. What appealed most to me were the changes in Dalgleish as he questions his career. Reminisces about his past with Father Baddeley also provide a glimpse of the boy he once was. Great stuff!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Funny retro style game. Good for one or two play throughs. I think it's supposed to combine asteroids and space invaders. I haven't played those but it's what I heard from other people who have it. It lets you continue indefinitely and power up weapons.
B005P58PZC|5.0|Having been a fan of the original \\"Nikita\\" tv series I admit this adaptation is different and better with much more action AND because my favorite actor Aaron Stanford plays Birkhoff, the sarcastic and frustated but loveable computer nerd who provides most of the show's comic relief. Season I was great, Season II is faster in pace and almost breathtaking in terms of plot. Some of the characters' backstories have been revealed, unfortunately not Birkhoff's. There were hints that he might end up with a girlfriend this season but so far that hasn't worked out. Many online fans are looking forward to \\"Nerd\\" getting a girlfriend, which would be great after all that he's been through in both seasons. Some of the secondary characters seem to come and go at random, which is a bit disconcerting. My only complaint is that there should be a backstory for Birkhoff, who has been a regular both seasons. I'm not his only fan, and Birkhoff was actually my favorite character in the original series. I bought Season I of this series and await the DVD release of Season II with great anticipation.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! The story is sweet, sometimes sad and always uplifting. The interaction of the characters and how they each deal with the challenges in their lives is heartwarming. The interwoven theme is acceptance and learning to let go, but it's not predictable or trite.

B006OFN0SE|2.0|I really looked forward to this film because DiCaprio is an excellent actor (and he did a fine job here), and I am a big Clint Eastwood fan as well.  So I willingly paid top dollar for this in my Amazon digital box and boy oh boy was I disappointed.  I really thought that Mr. Eastwood is so big he is beyond political destructiveness, so that he would tell the truth about this horrible little man, J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />The real J. Edgar Hoover was deeply involved with the American Mafia all his life.  The mafia set up his happy horse race trysts with his gay lover and they kept the \\"dirt\\" on Hoover for his entire life.  The mafia was involved in the assassination of JFK and Hoover was not in a position to even investigate the crime.  You see, when Hoover was young, the ONLY place gay people could go for socializing was mafia owned clubs, and the guest lists at these clubs provided the mafia with quite a powerful blackmail weapon against many a politician, actor, activist, or any other public or private individual; Hoover included.  The power of the tools of blackmail was not lost on him and he became quite the master of it.  The movie touched on his files a tiny bit, but the guts of that story was completely left out.<br /><br />Hoover was a paranoid angry little man who used his blackmail list to stay in his position far beyond his time.  He ruined the reputation of the FBI and his name does not belong on their buildings.  Hoover's fight to stay closeted has flavored many a closeted politician in today's Washington D.C. scene as well.  Seems today's politicians took a cue from Hoover, and they keep dirt files on one another today, and they use blackmail and backstabbing to run today's America.<br /><br />Some gift this guy left for America, huh?  This aspect of this tiny, evil little man was never touched upon in the film.  Instead the entire film played like a soft shoe gay love story minus the sex scenes.  I was very disappointed.  I hope some day some director will write the truth about this guy.... how about it Oliver Stone?
B000031XCR|3.0|I'm not a fan, in the sense that I want to go past the point of casual listening.  I remember hearing \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" on my beater car radio going to work.  My (now ex-) wife and I were going cold and icey, but I didn't want it that way.  I heard the song, it got to me.  The \\"...flesh and the fantasies...\\" line really hit home, I suppose the sentimentality struck a nerve.  I picked up this hits comp, and sometimes I'm in the mood for schmaltz, sentimentality, that voice (well, it sounds, um, maybe a bit too distant, sentimental, but it is pleasant and mildly operatic).  From this set, I picked up much of her other catalog.  Actually, I went back before this set out of curiosity after reading Carl Wilson's book, LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE, A JOURNEY TO THE EDGE OF TASTE.  (I \\"get\\" his book, it's a very good read).<br /><br />Frankly, I don't get the backlash about her, but I think I might have a few clues, none of which seem really valid--valid in the sense she'd light off a non-fan (rock fan boring, yes; I-hate-Celine-Dion puking, no, really.  Save that for Kenny Rogers and Eddy Arnold.):<br /><br />a) she's phenomenally popular.  The low-born music snobs in us recoil when everyone else finds \\"our thing.\\"<br /><br />b) Her '90s and early 2000s material suggests it was put together by a considerable number of marketing experts honing every note and nuance, second-by-second, with endless focus group testing.  (Thematically reminds me of Angela Landsbury's lines in the MANCHERIAN CANDIDATE about her husband's prepared speech to be performed after the assasination on stage)<br /><br />c) She seems to be following that recording career trajectory of Barbra Streisand from the end of the '60s (slightly rocking-up her repertoire; in Streisand's case, doing a little with the group Fanny), and among vinyl junkies, well, we all joke about trying to get past the millions and millions and millions of Barb Streisand albums clogging up used bins everywhere.  Eh, see \\"a\\" above.<br /><br />d) As a vocalist, she reminds me most of hearing Eddie Fisher.  Her pop records have a \\"big sound\\" (I believe that phrase was attributed to him and the bombastic backing on stuff like \\"Lady of Spain,\\" by Hugo Winterhalter orchestra, before rock 'n' roll ended his career on the record charts) and she blows and blows LOUD!<br /><br />Artistically, the American stuff, she's marketed lowbrow and she's been stylistically produced to be the kind of \\"artistic\\" that people who don't like art think is \\"artistic,\\" which is in the marketing approach.  Eh, see \\"b,\\" above.  It makes her \\"uncool\\" among those kind of snobby people who have spirited, loud, arguments about the classical music of Ozzy vs. Van Halen.  (I mean:  people who think that high art, classical music, is Ozzy.  Like Boston is classical music, chamber music....)  These are the pedestrian folks who blew up when Celine Las Vegas schmaltzed AC/DC's \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" on DIVAS LAS VEGAS.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks her version of AC/DC was the WORST song ever doesn't dig very deep in BAD music.  Boobs, proles, plebians, peasants.<br /><br />e) The \\"good music,\\" MOR, A/C marketing niche is the death of \\"cool.\\"  It's the dead-end ghetto of 1980 slick Johnny Mathis, Neil Diamond (once upon a time he made good records, pre-Columbia), Dionne Warwick, Dirty Dancing soundtrack, and Barry Manilow's tendency to regroove an endless repetition of Ravel's \\"Bolero\\" as sad pity love songs in the late '70s.<br /><br />And I like the direction she seems to be taking, little baby steps, maybe--TAKING CHANCES.  It's a good sign that all her cloing, angry fans seem to be getting annoyed and irritated she's going more rock.  She's too good to be wasted cloning the same song over and over again.

B004I2K4DY|2.0|I am a fan of this musical and have heard many casts do it and do it well.  When I purchased this, I thought it would be the same version (or as good as) the \\"in concert\\" version I saw on TV in the 90's.<br /><br />It let me down in many layers... First the director has chosen to take nearly every song at a blistering speed.  Not only is it unpleasant to hear, but the vocalists are \\"singing\\" so fast they can barely get the words out.  This leads me to the next problem where the singers aren't singing as much as they are shouting quickly.  There are a couple exceptions - the Bishop, Fontine (did well in solo but nothing else), the Innkeeper, and maybe a couple others.  Out of a cast of probably 60 plus a choir, that's pretty sad.  Also, they've cut chunks out of songs.  It doesn't feel like any of these people or directors have actually played any of these characters on stage.  It feels like someone plopped them in front of a mic.<br /><br />If you like this musical do not get this!  I am currently hunting for the older one.  Sorry to have to leave an unpleasant review.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|We just finished watching Season 2 of Downton Abbey, and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Yes, it can be soap opera-ish at times, but for us that didn't detract from the entertainment value of the series. All of our favorite characters are back (thank goodness!), and for those individuals who were somewhat one-dimensional in Season 1, it was interesting to see their personalities and morals further develop as the inhabitants of Downton struggle with the effects and ramifications of World War I.<br /><br />As with Season 1, the dialogue comes fast, and a lot is communicated - both verbally and visually - during many very short scenes. No doubt a second or third watching is in order to fully appreciate both the visuals and the nuances of the script.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the \\"Christmas at Downton\\" season finale on disc 3 is a great episode, and very satisfying. We can't wait for Season 3!<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the quality of the Blu-ray images is fantastic, but we did have an on-going issue with \\"judder\\", the jerky movement of objects and people during horizontal pans of the camera. This issue was non-existent on our Season 1 Blu-ray discs, and we could only adjust our TV to reduce the judder, not eliminate it completely on all three Season 2 discs. Whether this is due to the disc coversion process used by PBS, or if it is just an issue with our set up, we are not sure.<br /><br />In any event, Downton Abbey Season 2 is a thrilling, moving, entertaining ride through history. Enjoy!
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Excellent film, but the blu-ray disk keeps locking up, and Amazon refuses to send another copy. Now that what I call customer service.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|After an extremely disappointing \\"Under the Dome\\", I was almost hesitant to purchase \\"11/22/63\\".  But, I JUST CAN'T QUIT STEPHEN KING!  So, even though it ALSO broke my \\"no Kindle eBook over $9.99\\" rule, I went for it.  Wow!  Am I glad I did!<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is Stephen King at the top of his game.  All  the things King does well were evident in this novel - an absolute page-turner with a compelling plot, complex characters and even a satisfying ending.<br /><br />This novel is not King's usual \\"horror\\" offering - it is more of a fantasy/historic fiction/time travel story that I think would appeal to anyone who appreciates a really good read. It probably holds an even stronger appeal to we Baby Boomers who remember when JFK was President.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|The movie is fun imo.  It's kind of sad though that this and Alien(s) are like the best sci-fi over the last thirty years(basicaly, they're the best sci-fi of the 80s).<br /><br />The sci-fi movie isn't about exploration of the universe and dealing with irrational humanity - as usual.  Instead, it's about humanity fearing the machines might get too smart(and then, of course, someone just outwiting the machines) and destroy us wonderful smart humans.  Anybody ever hear of the dark ages?  How about how the Judeo-Christian bible saying how evil humanity is?(you know, the flood story; wipe out all those evil others - except of course the chosen ones Jews).  And of course, this story sidesteps and neutralises the fact that the problem with guns and technology isn't the technology, but the 'people' using it!<br /><br />I just find the psychology of humans and anti-science/technology behind the making and the fame of this movie rather striking.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I just finished the last of the Hunger Games series - Mockingjay.  I completely LOVED the first two books, which really surprised me being this was a series aimed at \\"young adults\\" and I am anything but!  This last installment was also great until the very end.  I got the distinct feeling that the author either got tired of the subject and just gave it an extremely abrupt and sloppy finish or for other reasons did not wish to devote the time and attention to tie up all the loose ends and make this a more satisfying conclusion.  With all the detail we went through with the characters up to that point, it just left me kind of saying \\"huh?\\"  What gives??  I ended up with a ton of questions, but completely without the hint that they will ever be addressed.  The way the story ends didn't really sound like the author was planning on coming back and delving any further into the lives of these characters.  Very odd way to end the series....  I DO plan on seeing the movie adaptation when it is released in March, but would hope that the author figures out a way to come back and tidy up the final result of this one.....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game app.  It is addicting. My nephews love playing as much as I do. This app will provide you with hours of entertainment.

B004EWEX9Y|3.0|I purchased this cable to be used with my Ipod and my home stereo/ speaker system.  The audio cables work but you need to purchase a separate power outlet to plug into the USB otherwise your Ipod does not charge.  The product would be more complete with an outlet as well as a simple stand so that you could see your music choices etc.  As of now, my ipod lays flat next to the stereo system (facing upside-down b/c the plug is at the bottom).  The only other issue we had is that when we disconnected it, we lost all the music and had to reboot the entire ipod.  Im not sure if the cable did this but we have plugged the ipod into various other sources and never had this issue before.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome app. been using it for over 1yr and have had no problems. love it. I have this app installed on all my aneroid devices.

B0035YDM9E|5.0|Published at [...]    Joseph Stiglitz received the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics and shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change (IPCC). He is a professor of Economics at Columbia University and was Chief Economist of the World Bank from 1997-2000.    Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy, published in 2010, is Stiglitz' analysis of what caused the recession of 2007-2009, what we have learned and what we should have learned (but apparently have not).    We start with a straightforward world view in which we have markets, regulations, and intermediation. The purpose of banks is to facilitate payments between buyers and sellers and to make loans. Market participants are motivated by self-interest. The role of regulation is to set constraints on market participants in the interests of society. The crisis of the last several years was caused by a systemic failure across these realms.    In a nutshell, changes in the financial services industry created incentives for a range of market participants--notably banks--to take very large risks with the prospects of short-term gains. Under the old model, a bank would make a mortgage loan and then hold that loan on its books. The bank had a strong incentive to make sure that the borrower could afford the loan. The bank made money from the interest payments on the debt. If the borrower defaulted, the bank would lose money. Under the new model, mortgage lenders got paid for originating loans but did not keep these loans. The mortgages were bundled up and sold to investors (this is the process of securitization). The mortgage lenders, in other words, made money on the origination, packaging, and sales of the mortgages but no longer had a stake in ensuring the long-term viability of the mortgage. This shift in the mortgage industry turned the old incentives upside down. Not surprisingly, the mortgage industry started to create less and less viableproducts and was far less discriminating about who qualified for a loan. The mortgage crisis simply confirms that most people will behave in the way that you give them incentives to behave.    Stiglitz sees the financial innovation in the last decade or two as being directed almost entirely at creative new ways to generate short-term profits and to circumvent or at least game regulations. Banks took risky sub-prime mortgages and combined them into a portfolio that appeared to be of high quality. The process by which this occurred required that the ratings agencies and the regulators were somewhat lax.    The problem of perverse incentives was nowhere as evident as with the banks which had grown `too big to fail.' The banks were confident that the government would bail them out if they got into trouble, so they had a clear incentive to take the biggest risks they could get away with. Once again, the banks simply responded to the incentive structure that was created for them.    Dr. Stiglitz is deeply concerned that public policy is entirely driven by special interests, who lobby entirely too successfully to create policies that benefit them at the expense of the broader society. This is an over-arching theme of the book. The financial sector has used its enormous financial might to influence policy and regulation in its own interest. Stiglitz posits that this situation poses an enormous long-term threat to the viability of the United States. In the last chapter of the book, he summarizes his position on this theme:    It will be hard for American to achieve whatever vision it sees for itself when it is so blinded by campaign contributions and lobbyists and its system of revolving doors. Perhaps we will be able to muddle through, but at what costs to us today and at what costs to future generations? This crisis should be an awakening sign: the costs can be high, very high, beyond even what the richest country of the world can afford.    How does all of this impact thepeople who make up the vast majority of the population? In light of the evidence, it is not surprising that the average person--with no access to the halls of power--is losing ground. Dr. Stiglitz provided an overview of his position on economic disparity in America in a widely read article published in May of 2011. The United States is becoming increasingly economically stratified. As more of our national wealth is concentrated in the hands of the very wealthy, Stiglitz sees it as an inescapable outcome that the lower and middle classes will see their standard of living decline in the coming years.    This book provides ample evidence that people and companies act in ways that are directly responsive to theconomic incentives that apply to them. This is not surprising or new. What emerges, however, is the idea that people and companies are so entirely motivated by financial gain that they will often tend to act in ways that are enormously costly to society. Stiglitz concludes, ultimately, that the responses to the crisis are insufficient to reign in even the most egregious politics of self-interest, so his outlook for the future is not optimistic:    In several critical areas, in the midst of the crisis, matters have already become worse. We have altered not only our institutions--but the very rules of capitalism. We have announced that for favored institutions there is to be little, or no, market discipline. We have created an ersatz capitalism with unclear rules--but with a predictable outcome: future crisis; undue risk taking at the public expense, no matter what the promise of a new regulatory regime; and greater inefficiency. We have lectured about the importance of transparency, but we have given the banks greater scope for manipulating their books. In earlier crises, there was worry about moral hazard, the adverse incentives provided by bailouts; but the magnitude of this crisis has given new meaning to the concept.    This is a book well worth reading. I have not previously encountered such a complete and cogent analysis not only of our recent global financial crisis, but also of the development of forces that laid the groundwork for this crisis. For those who have not previously explored the drivers of the crash, this book will be an eye-opener.
B0063GORYU|4.0|it helps me kill time at any place I have a long wait or in the train. Sometimes I can't stop playing.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great movie and still love the story.<br />The disk came quickly from Amazon as expected!<br /><br />Solid enough of a movie to add to any library! Already watched it 3 times!
B004G6009U|5.0|This animation is so well made! All characters were done great, well developed and some were very charming. The plot of the story is interesting and reminded me of some other fairy tales. Voice acting is really good and witty humor in some places just makes the story and characters look even better. The soundtrack is just fine and the animation is not short in duration, which I liked and was right for the animation. It isn't too short and isn't too long. However, I would still probably enjoy it if the animation was even longer in time. The story goes in depth and is really interesting. The created world is also very beautiful. I didn't make the wrong choice and was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was created. This is the animation that must stand among my favorite animations on my shelf. And it is for any ages, kids or adults.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mah-jongg is a fun casual game and the added quest is a nice twist. This game has crisp, clear graphics, easy-to-follow gameplay, and doesn't freeze up like the last mah-jongg game I downloaded. Worth a download!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is amazing.  Hugh Howley knits a post-apocalyptic world that rises up around the reader like the walls of the silo in which it takes place.  If you've been looking for a new and well-written scifi fix, you'll find it in Wool.  You'll know the characters, you'll see the world they live in, hear its noises and smell its scents.  You'll read this book from one end to the other without putting it down, wondering how you'll make it through the next day with the sleep you've lost, haunted by the echo of the world of Wool in your mind.  This book is a must-read.
B005B19UPE|5.0|It is a rare book that causes me to yell out \\"OH NO!\\" but I did with this one.  The book was captivating, and whenever I had a moment I just had to see what was happening with the characters.  The past and present are first introduced to you in alternating chapters, but they soon merge and you are on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.  The author, who is very talented I might say, brings  you to the brink of knowing, then turns you on your heels. I so enjoyed this book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its okay but the games aren't the funnest ever but I guess its okay it keeps me entertained I guess
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|Games alright but the control is kinda whacked.. Even though I touch the left side of the screen it still goes right and vise versa.

1416550550|5.0|I read House at Riverton and liked it very much, but I LOVED this book.  It held my interest until the end.  It was all wrapped up very nicely and had a little romance and a little suspense and mystery.  I am a big reader and tough critic, and would definitely recommend this book.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I love this game. It reminds me of a cross between the 1980's arcade games Centipede, Space Invaders, and Asteroids.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|yesterday it was the free app of the day so I decided to get it. I didn't know if I'd like it but it's pretty fun. I'd recommend this game to people who like killing aliens.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|I'm actually breaking my review up into two different ratings.<br />First, for the actual story. Second, for the Audio version.<br /><br />My Book Review~<br />This book was a fun read. I was engrossed with all the different creatures in this book. I also enjoyed the bantor between Atticus and his dog, Oberon. Yes, I said dog!<br />Atticus is not the average 21 y. old male, living in Tempe, Az. trying to live a normal, quite life. He owns a store and has a dog, sounds normal, right? WRONG! Atticus is actually a Druid, and he's over 2000 yrs. old. He is trying to live a normal life, but things are definitetly not normal.<br /><br />All kinds of creatures and beings are trying to interrupt his life all over a sword, but this isn't a normal sword, nope it's a magical sword that is coveted by a God. This God will stop at nothing to try to steal this sword away from Atticus, He sends all kinds of creatures, witches, demons, etc. to try to take down Atticus, but Atticus seems to always stay a step ahead of them. Using magic, and some helpful friends who always seem to show up at the right time. He manages to allude the danger, until friends actually turn into foe, or do they?<br /><br />The fun parts of this book had to be, for me, the interaction between Atticus and his dog, Oberon. Oberon and Atticus don't actually talk to each other, vocally, they \\"talk\\" to each mentally and it's funny and likable. This book is filled with action, flows well, and is different from anything else out there. 4 stars for the storyline<br /><br />My Audio Review~<br />I actually got the Audio, unabridged version of this book, and I must say it was a narrative delight.<br />Luke Daniels, who is a professional actor narrated this book and he did a great job tapping into the different characters and voiceing them with different accents. The voice he uses to play Oberon(the dog) is a delight, as you can only imagine how your dog could truly sound like, if it could talk. Luke also narrates each character's accent or voice with a true actors insight and plays up the uniquness in each character. I enjoyed his narration  and will continue listening to the rest of this series, as oppossed to reading it.<br />5 Stars to Luke Daniels narrative!character's accent or voice with a true actors insight and plays up the uniquness in each character. I enjoyed his narration  and will continue listening to the rest of this series, as oppossed to reading it.<br />5 Stars to Luke Daniels narrative!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Utterly compelling and disturbing. A real emotional roller coaster that reminded me a lot of Jodi Picoult's work. Loved the writing, the suspense and the story.<br /><br />My only criticism would be the pacing, which, at times, was a little slow... but not enough to really detract from my enjoyment.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Lovely and lovely to hear all of Dylan's songs sung by these great artists.  The different renditions are interesting and yet recall the Dylan thrust.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|force close on my Rezound every time I try to open it. restarted, reinstalled, no luck. I am uninstalling. works fine on my kindle fire tho
B0067Q42BY|5.0|would be fun but half way through it freezes up on me. $5? Really? is there a fix coming? playing on my kindle fire.
1609611543|5.0|I found out about this book based on someone's review of another book on Amazon and decided to order it.  About ten or so years ago, I started having eczema or dermatitis on my forearms, back, buttocks, etc.  I had been living in Northern California for a few years so I assumed I must be allergic to something I wasn't exposed to as much in Texas.  I saw a couple of different dermatologists and had a biopsy which turned up nothing.  I was prescribed steroid creams which helped some while I used them, but I was hesitant to keep using them because of long term side effects.  About five years ago, I eliminated different things I thought I might be allergic to and my skin cleared up completely and I lost quite a bit of weight.  One of the things I eliminated for awhile was wheat.  I got complacent and slowly everything I'd eliminated crept back into my diet.  The dermatitis came back and I suffered with it.  I had a food sensitivity test done (IgG) and I was barely reactive to anything and wheat was completely non-reactive.  I went to an allergist for the stick test and was not allergic (histamine response) to anything in the traditional sense.  He also said the IgG antibodies weren't really measures of allergic reactions--not sure what that means.  After that, I thought it might be Vitamin D after a test came back slightly low so I started supplementing.  Then I thought maybe it was aspartame or someting.  I don't think I've been tested specifically for celiac disease but something in this book resonated with me when it talked about dermatitis herpetiformis.  I'm going to eliminate wheat again and will report back.  For the first time in years, I feel like I've figured out what's causing my skin problems.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I received my order ahead of the date stated which was a great surprise as this was a gift item. The details of the product did not do the actual item justice. The series arrived in an excellent collectors box and the 10 seasons are carfully split between the six characters of the show; with each containing a little over two seasons. Each of the character cases has their current picture on the front and their picture during the tv series on the back. In addition, the character cases are hard bound and sturdy with sleeves for each of the cd's appointed to that character. Also included in the series box is a very nice soft cover book of pictures and stories from the show and the characters. This turned out to be an excellent keepsake for a beloved tv series and was full of extras that were unexpected. It is a very nice package and I would highly recommend it to any fan of the Friends Series. You won't be disappointed.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|it force closes before the program even starts. wanted to play it, and I'll try it again. just glad I didn't pay for it

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Fun app with retro appeal.  Has a nice since of humor to it using dialogoe and story elements of old-school scifi games.  only complaint thatb have is that the ship just auto fires instead of having the ability to shoot manually.  makes accuracy a little loose to me at times.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|its ok at first and then it gets boring...the first like, 20 levels are ok and way to easy but afetr that they are boring...
1583334386|5.0|I was a bit wary purchasing this book, because it seemed to be part of the 'self-help' category which I generally try to avoid. However The Willpower Instinct is truly insightful, providing the science behind all the ideas it sets forth and giving specific examples and stories to make the science meaningful. It had so many great suggestions/improvements, but more importantly it was very eye-opening and has made me critically analyze my own behavior. It is a great read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone - regardless of how you feel about your willpower at the moment.
B005ZUR724|5.0|All the reviews about it not running is wrong. If you get it for kindle its a butifull thing. I run it with no problem.

B004GTLVOA|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />Spoilerish - Intent to be read if you have already read.<br />[...]<br /><br />I ventured forth with a re-read of Drums of Autumn because I had just finished doing a re-read Voyager. I honestly didn't plan for a re-read of the Outlander series right now but I sorta just fell into it after reading and reviewing The Scottish Prisoner. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />I remember that when I read Drums of Autumn the first and second time, I did enjoy it but because I was so anxious to read anything and everything about Jamie and Claire, I'd skip through a lot of Roger and Bree story lines. This time around I didn't. I just sat back and really took my time and thoroughly enjoyed every chapter and every character. It was fabulous. I feel like I have now just experienced Roger and Bree on a different level.<br /><br />I do remember being so pleased that when Diana Gabaldon wrote Bree, that she didn't just do a carbon copy of Jamie and Claire. Yes she had Jamie's looks and some of his mannerisms but Bree is definitely her own person. I also have to remember that she is young and she will make mistakes that young people will make. I found I appreciated that trait of hers more this time and I was way more forgiving in some of the things she did and how she did them.<br /><br />Drums of Autumn is quite fabulous. So much happens in this book but not in an angsty, heart palpating way. A lot of character growth and the story moved forward by leaps and bounds. I think back to all the scenes that happened in Drums of Autumn and I am blown away by how much time had passed.<br /><br />Claire delivered some of my favourite lines in Drums of Autumn.<br /><br />\\"You're a walking inducement to harlots,\\" I said. \\"Stick by me; I'll protect you.\\"<br /><br />\\"He's much sneakier than I thought,\\" I said. \\"Practically Scottish.\\"<br /><br />\\"Actually, it's your kilt that make me want to fling you to the floor and commit ravishment,\\" I told him.<br /><br />\\"May the Lord deliver me from stubborn Scotsmen!\\" I said.<br /><br />And a Jamie quote worth noting....<br />\\"Your face is my heart, Sassenach,\\" he said softly, \\"and love of you is my soul.\\"<br /><br />The building of Fraser Ridge really provided an excellent foundation for the North Carolina setting and a true appreciation of what the first settlers encountered.<br /><br />If reading Voyager was about Jamie and Claire's reunion, then Drums of Autumn was about Jamie meeting his daughter, Bree. The anticipated scene was fabulous and I wouldn't change a thing. Without a doubt, that encounter was my favourite scene in the entire book. Followed closely by birth of Jemmy. I adore that the birth was a wee bit of a family event.<br /><br />I also found that I enjoyed more of the Indian interactions this time around. I was still very impacted and my heart was heavy for Ian. I found Ian was on my mind a lot and I was ever so thankful that Diana Gabaldon included that letter from Ian to Jamie and Claire while they were attending the Gathering.<br /><br />Of course I need to move on to The Fiery Cross now. I am quite excited about it since that book was my least favourite of the series and now I am thinking after this experience, I will enjoy it that much more.<br /><br />Teasers: Stephen Bonnet the pirate, bear attach and fought off with a fish, Bree's engagement to Lord John, birth of Jemmy and the biological puzzle that goes along with hime worth noting....  \\"Your face is my heart, Sassenach,\\" he said softly, \\"and love of you is my soul.\\"    The building of Fraser Ridge really provided an excellent foundation for the North Carolina setting and a true appreciation of what the first settlers encountered.

B007BLCGNU|4.0|There are many novelists who profess that they really don't know how their novel will end when they set out to write it, that the plot develops as they progress. I had to wonder if director Clint Eastwood went through the same process in making \\"J. Edgar\\". Of course that's not possible, movie-making doesn't work that way, so perhaps it's just the subtlety of his progression that just made me think that he did.<br /><br />Sitting down to watch it I knew first that I would hate Hoover. No, more, I really wanted to hate Hoover... historically, what's not to hate, the man was a mono-maniacal paranoid, a narcissistic, closeted, cross-dressing, hypocritical power-abuser, a polluter of all that could have been good in the still relatively young and malleable America of his time. And yes, all that is there in the movie, even down to the cross-dressing. Clint seems go at it dourly and steadfastly to begin with, the young Hoover is as pushy and repellant as you would expect, but as we see more of his character's complexity, told in tandem with his youthful zeal and intractable old-age, it appears like the liberal softy that he (Clint) is just can't go through with it. So gradually it turns the corner and becomes a rather touching gay love-story. So much so that we lose focus somewhat on J. Edgar himself in favor of his long-time companion, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), who becomes our surrogate in observing the appalling self-parody that Hoover becomes. Eastwood is so good, drawing you in to the life of a notorious historical villain, setting him up, then almost forgiving him. Yes, there is absolution here. Hoover loved, and was loved in return, by Tolson, who is portrayed as essentially a good guy, and was also loved by his long time secretary, Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts). They both see him as flawed but not a monster, and we see how Hoover himself, like all monsters, did not think himself a monster. Anything but. Eastwood never lets Hoover's public jaw drop. If nothing else, Hoover believes.<br /><br />I suppose I came away from this movie just as Eastwood would want me to, outraged, conflicted, and unwillingly sympathetic. But this is the director, after all, who specializes in seeing things from a different angle, who'll make a movie about his own youthful persona in earlier movies (\\"The Unforgiven\\") and  even make two completely different movies about the same events (\\"Letters from Iwo-Jima\\" and \\"Flags of our Fathers\\") Like in those movies, in \\"J. Edgar\\" he slams mythology head-on into humanity. Humanity wins, of course. This is Hollywood. Nevertheless, I think the man is amazing.<br /><br />Oh, and if anybody ever again tells you that Leo DeCaprio, who plays Hoover, can't act, point them in this movie's direction.

B003Y5H542|5.0|If ever there was a case of a good film that's been somewhat sabotaged by its marketing campaign, it's this one.  This is a beautifully animated, often very funny film that isn't really meant for young kids - though its marketing campaign would seem to have suggested otherwise. (Well, that, and the overall American sentiment that animated films must be for kids - a perception due in no small part to Disney and to years of kid-orientated marketing for mainstream animated films).  Having read through some of the lukewarm to outright negative reviews, I've concluded that this marketing misstep is really the root cause for the 3 1/2 star average rating.  People went into the theater with their kids expecting one  thing, got quite another, and left (understandably) feeling a little ticked off.<br /><br />So, bear in mind: adults, you may really like this film if you can appreciate a little dark humor (there's a joke about road kill that, while not overly graphic - and while I found it funny - might be a bit much for a little kid), and if you have an understanding of some basic Hollywood (and literary) archetypes, which this film often sends up.  You may also appreciate this one if you admire beautiful animation.  (And this one *is* beautifully animated - perhaps the most visually beautiful computer animated flick that I've seen outside of `Wall-E.'  Here's a case where Blu-Ray is a blessing.)<br /><br />Kids, however, may not get this flick, and may even be left a bit bored and/or confused.  It's a shame that the marketing for this flick was so way off base. (I kind of felt the same way about 'Babe: Pig in the City' - another good flick that was badly marketed.)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very pleased with the MicroShell cover.  I like that it is light and easy to use and can be used as a stand when reading.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|Three and half stars - and, in my opinion, a prime example of a case in which the star rating system may not provide the ideal picture of a film's quality.  This is a good film with admirable qualities, and one drawback that nonetheless prevents it from achieving the greatness for which it strives.<br /><br />In short: this is a densely plotted, methodical, deliberately paced film that is also highly atmospheric and very well acted.  At the same time, the film isn't always easy to follow and might have done with an additional scene or two of exposition. There are numerous characters in this movie, with numerous motives and motives within motives, and at a mere two hours all of this can get a bit overwhelming.  (Not that I need a film's plot and characters spoon fed to me, but with material as complex as this, a little exposition isn't a bad thing.)<br /><br />Again, far from a bad film, with many strong qualities to recommend it. (Again, the acting is first rate - though with a cast like this, one would hope it would be. The cinematography, costumes, and art decoration are equally strong: this story looks like a story set in the Seventies should look).  There is intelligence here.  And yet the script is too heavy on its labyrinthine plot machinations and too light on its exposition.  A little more wouldn't have hurt.

B0073PZIYI|4.0|It was much better than I expected. . . especially after watching other films that try to meld political commentary with sci fi.<br /><br />It reminds me, and I think intended to remind us, of today's America made a bit worse, as time to live replaces money. One per cent or so have most of the time, much more than they need or many of them even want. Quite a few are in the middle. Many, and a growing number, struggle to get time to live just another day, or often even a few minutes so they can then earn or steal enough time to try to live another day, week or month. Worst of all, the scarcity of time for the majority is an artificial creation, as is IMO the current austerity.<br /><br />It's a warning and a call for us to change direction. It is silly to think two people can do it, but that makes a good story.

B002BWP49C|1.0|The movie and the story are so horrible that I have to write this. But first, a question...doesn't Bella come across as a moronic teenager? Has no ambition, is superbly whinnying, and not to mention...extremely selfish. It is wrong to blame Bella though; the character was created by an untalented author. The story has no substance or imagination, and is more or less centered on impatient, aimless and cranky teenagers. It is an attempted love story, which wasn't convincing by any standards. I read the first novel and couldn't bring myself to read the others. Movies were worst. And this latest installment is an atrocity. There is nothing epic about this series; it is dead as a rock (or Edward). It could have been completed in 30 minutes. Sheer dumbness!
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|to understand why I am so in awe of this movie.  I went back and forth for quite some time before I finally purchased this movie. I read the customer reviews on this movie but honestly, I guess because I'm stuck in that mindset that a vampire is supposed to look like all the others I've seen, I kept saying. .\\"Hmmmm I don't know.\\"  Then I went back again and read more customer reviews and I thought all these people  agree that this movie is great, they can't all be off the mark, so I took a chance and finally ordered it.  I got it Saturday and I watched it twice. .I even cried at a couple scenes the pregnant girl getting killed and the sister (nun). .. It wasn't what I expected at all and very different than most vampire movies you see, but it was awesome. So I want to thank all the folks that gave detailed customer reviews because I'm definitely on board now. . it was everything you said and more!

B006P0FD4W|2.0|My 19 year old daughter saw this at the theater and came home terrified. I thought I don't know if I want to see a movie like that given my daughters reaction. But being the horror fan I am I finally took a chance and ordered it. Boy do I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />First off Micah got on my nerves THROUGHOUT THE THE WHOLE MOVIE taking all those bumps and strange occurrences as a joke, talking crap to the demon AND let's not leave out him going out getting a Ouija board after she pleaded with him not to. I mean really if someone tells you they've had stuff like that happening to them and it terrifies them where's the humor in that. . Then another point that irritated me was all this stuff was happening and Micah says don't call the demonologist. .\\"What?\\" and of course by the time they did he was out of town. I wasn't scared by this I guess because I was so irritated by the time it ended.  I think Blair Witch was a bigger scare than this.  I was not feeling this movie at all.

030726999X|3.0|The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest picks up where the Girl Who Played With Fire left off. It was long and drawn out, and seemed repetitive. Half way through the book I was ready for it to be over. I feel like the author could have cut out 3/4 of the irrelevant material and tacked the rest on to the end of the Girl Who Played with fire. If there had been a 4th book, I probably would not have read it. I had been hoping it would be its own story like the previous 2 books were.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|From a fan that has stuck with Opeth ever since their early appearance on a Candlelight Records compilation, and a tribute to Celtic Frost, I will say this is about as immature as Opeth has ever sounded. Talent is plentiful, ideas wealthy, but outcome non-impressive.<br />Most death metal bands will say as they progress that they are musically maturing; or when they stop growling and implement only clean vocals, then vocally maturing. But in the case of 'Heritage', the sound has not matured much, it has changed in different directions and incoroprated a new realm of sounds, mainly jazz and quasi psychadelic rhythms, however, Åkerfeldt's vocals are sounding very child like, almost boy-bandish (no wonder there are reviews from Limp Bizkit and Blink182 fans, meaning the album's sound has reached and appealed to that audience). Åkerfeldt's clean vocals on previous albums are amazing and unique, but here it all failed to impress. I for one hope they return to the heritage of 'Watershed' and 'Blackwater Park', progressing on the sounds and clean vocals left off there.<br />I applaud the effort, and the amazing talent from bandmembers and guests, but this one should have stayed in the garage or been released under a side project name.

Hazel and Augustus and even Isaac will stay with me for a very long time. Based on the subject matter, it seems this book would be depressing... but it's not. In some very strange way, it was uplifting and hopeful. TFIOS is a beautiful picture of how two very real teenagers deal with adversity. They don't sugarcoat anything. They face life's uphill battles full on and we have a front row seat. Highly highly recommend this little gem.

0817439390|4.0|I bought this book and ended up returning it, so I wanted to clear up why in case someone else is in a similar situation. I already have knowledge of exposure and aperture from taking photography classes, and wanted a reference book to use to expand my knowledge on photography and improve my pictures. The reviews made it sound like it covered ways to improve your photos, but I found that it didn't tell me too much more than I already knew. This book only focuses on outdoor photography. Most of my photography is indoors, and of people, food or things, so none of his tips really helped me except maybe when traveling and taking photos outdoors. If you need help understanding exposure and the triangle of photography, this is a great book. The language is straight-forward, and the examples using actual photos are really great. However, if you know the basics,and want a book that covers broader range of topics and ways to perfect your photos, I would keep looking for a better book.<br />I ended up buying [[ASIN:1435459202 Complete Digital Photography]]. It is a great reference text for any photography questions from aperture to composition tricks to post production editing.

B006JN5KBG|3.0|Fright Night is one of the better vampire films from the 80's.  The special effects are gruesome and scary yet the movie is also sexy and fun too.  Yes it's from the 80's and it shows in a few places, but the movie still holds up very well today.  This movie was released in limited edition Blue-ray back in 2011.  The picture and sound of this edition look great.  The only thing keeping me from giving this edition 5 stars is the lack of extras.  They should have put a little more effort into this edition.  Audio commentary, deleted scenes, and retrospective interviews with the cast and film makers would have been nice.

0060873027|1.0|I've read all of Crichton's works (masochist that I am) as well as all the other works of virtually all the other thriller writers (what can I say, I'm a junkie.)  For someone with Crichton's insane level of brilliance and talent, it was heartbreaking to see his work degrade over time into putrid screeds attacking everyone and everything that differed from his own political and social beliefs.<br /><br />This final work, Micro, at last represents the bottom of the barrel. It tries to be a scientific thriller with echoes of Asimov's Fantastic Voyage, opening our eyes to the amazing life on the planet that lives at a different scale than we do.  Instead, the result is quite possibly the worst piece of garbage I have read in a decade. While I'm sure the entomology is accurate, given all the sources quoted (and the hapless but educated co-writer who apparently contributed most of the insect details), everything else in the book is so laughably, ridiculously wrong, poorly written, and mean-spirited that you will want to wash your hands after you finish reading it (if, indeed, you get that far.)<br /><br />It's not that Micro requires suspension of disbelief about the technology...that's the bargain you make with a techno-thriller. Instead it's the *real* things (the way companies work, employees are hired, ventures are financed, options are distributed, human beings behave, etc, etc, etc) that are so bizarrely, ridiculously, blatantly wrong that it will make you want to either throw the book away, or beat it with a stick. Seriously.<br /><br />Aside from the ridiculous plotting, turgid writing that tries to be a Discovery Channel special, and glaringly ridiculous mistakes, I think what disturbed me most about this book was its mean-spiritedness. From multiple gratuitously disgusting violent scenes (and since I'm the kind of person who actually likes techno thrillers, and even puts up with stuff like Marcinko, you have to go pretty far across the line to gross me out), to killing off multiple sympathetic characters, this book is NOT a fun read.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you're at an airport newsstand I'd suggest that you get ANY other book, including one written in Swahili, if that's all they have.<br /><br />Now, ask me how I really feel.killing off multiple sympathetic characters, this book is NOT a fun read.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you're at an airport newsstand I'd suggest that you get ANY other book, including one written in Swahili, if that's all they have.<br /><br />Now, ask me how I really feel.

145162445X|5.0|Since the time of the Enlightenment the central question of existence: `Why is there something than nothing?' has perplexed and nagged thinkers from all disciplines, including astronomers and physicists.<br /><br />Inevitably, when considering the question, the issue of an external agent or \\"creator\\" generally entered, often by default. As one theologian from Loyola University, New Orleans once put it in a Metaphysics class I recall from 1965:<br /><br />\\"If nothing be the simpler state, in which an already perfect, infinite deity could still exist as \\"spirit\\" then why create a material addendum ....or universe? Why make such addition, especially if it would be fraught with violence, despair, \\"sin\\" and all the rest?\\"<br /><br />Good question! Why indeed? (Note: the pertinent question here for philosophy is indeed `Why?' and not `How?')<br /><br />As I recall pointing out to the professor priest, since he ab initio assigned the \\"infinite\\" attribute (which also implies the usual ultra-qualities: omniscience, omnipresence, etc.)<br /><br />\\"You've proposed a creation by which an omniscient God would have to know (if it was judgmental) that it would have to condemn billions to perdition before he even created them. This makes the act of creation de facto an act of violence against those created who would not be able (for whatever reason, including where born) to live up to its standards.\\"<br /><br />When the shocked padre had sufficiently recovered his senses, he blinked several times and asked if I seriously accepted such a response.<br /><br />I responded:<br /><br />\\"Sure, if the scenario is what you have claimed, as opposed to the cosmos simply originating from nothing....No creators to take the blame!\\"<br /><br />Of course I'd not long since read the terrific book, `Great Ideas and Theories of Cosmology' by Jagjit Singh (Dover, 1961).<br /><br />I reference this book, because Singh's (1961) book was among the first to boldly lay waste the idea of a \\"creator\\" being responsible for the cosmos (Chapter XVI, p. 252), and indeed he notes:<br /><br />\\"No one... would dream of defending surrealism and cubism by an appeal to the tensor calculus or quantum theory, and it is as illogical to invoke scientific cosmology in support of God.<br /><br />For the practice of rationalism is an irreversible process. If once one loses the innocence of naïve belief by venturing to stray into rational thought, there can be no honest way of recovering it. When one has cut himself off from God by a first sip of the cup of knowledge, one will not rediscover Him by drinking its dregs, no matter how hard they may be boiled!\\"<br /><br />I note this because in many previous reviews, a common complaint against Lawrence Krauss' book is that he \\"drags atheism into cosmology\\". My question is, 'why not?' Singh does essentially the same thing, though a tad less directly than Prof. Krauss. The point is that the theme of rejecting a deity in terms of explaining the cosmos' origin goes back a long way - at least five decades.<br /><br />Even Stephen Hawking revived it in his book, `A Brief History of Time' though many readers may not have carefully parsed his words and only interpreted what they wanted to. For example, he clearly notes on p. 122 - after an audience with the pope, following a scientific conference at the Vatican:<br /><br />\\"At the end of the conference, the participants were granted an audience with the pope. He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang, but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself because that was the moment of creation and therefore the work of God.<br /><br />I was glad then that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given at the conference - the possibility that space-time was finite but had no boundary - which means that it had no beginning, no moment of creation.<br /><br />I had no desire to share the fate of Galileo, with whom I have a strong sense of identity\\".<br /><br />A few pages later in the same chapter, emphasizing the consequences of the quantum, boundary free cosmos, Hawking asks:<br /><br />\\"What need then for a Creator?\\"<br /><br />Which is precisely the point! Science and modern scientific theories, bearing predictions which can be verified - make religious or supernaturalist intrusion redundant.<br /><br />They add nada to the quality of predictions, nor do they afford a new variant of suggested observations based on existing ones. In other words, all they offer is some childish security blanket for the timid or mentally un-tough, but not much more.<br /><br />I use all this as a basis to dismiss all the likely future and past reviews-comments to the effect that this mindset has no place in a cosmology text. YES, it does!<br /><br />Thus, Krauss' take in his Preface, as well as Chapters 9-10 is perfectly justified and sound. For me, it also resonated with Stephen Hawking's recent `Green Planet' channel presentation (`God and the Origin of the Universe ` ) in which he presented a brilliant explanation of why no extraneous agents were needed.<br /><br />Hawking's point was that given an initial singularity, and that we know singularities are such that there can be no temporal passage (because of gravitational time dilation, or the tendency of clocks to slow in strong-g fields) then one can infer no time passage would be reckoned in any chronometer, whether in a black hole singularity or in a big bang singularity.<br /><br />If there's no time passage there can be no cause! If there is nothing that causes the universe in the first place, then again...there can be no God. (Since causality by definition is time-contingent...embodied in the very term `cause')<br /><br />Hawking's final argument was that the cosmos just \\"popped\\" into existence, by virtue of particle pair production which is governed by the Heisenberg Energy -time uncertainty principle. It is here where I wish Krauss himself would have provided a bit more quantitative detail, such as in actually showing the quantitative changes, i.e. how so much energy is allowed to emerge based on an infinitesimal time change. He gives a verbal description on page 71 but it would have been nice to actually show this.<br /><br />For example, if<br /><br />(delta E)(delta t) > h/ 2 pi<br /><br />And if delta t = 10^-30 secs then, the change in energy<br /><br />delta E = (1.054 x 10^-34 J-s)/ 10^- 30 s =  1.054 x 10^ -4 J created<br /><br />That is, more than 600 million  MeV or many times more energy than in most nuclear fusion reactions. And as we know, by Einstein's equation E= mc^2, energy and mass are the same aspects of the same entity. Hence, mass is `created' from nothing.<br /><br />Hawking's other point was that positive mass formation is always balanced by the appearance of negative gravitational potential, and hence ultimately the total of both positive and negative contributions cancel out to yield zero. Hawking demonstrates this using a hole and a mound of dirt extracted to form the hole. The hole represents the negative potential energy, and the mass or mound the positive. So, take the mound and move it back to the hole and it's covered up. Nothing remains, nothing left over...No room for any \\"creator\\"<br /><br />The same point made by Singh earlier, then Hawking in 'Brief History of Time' (subsequently strongly reiterated in `The Grand Design with co-author Leonard Mlodinow) and by Krauss - who gives perhaps the best summation of the work in the past 20 years. This is why to me Krauss' book is as defining a contribution to the nature of cosmic nothingness and dark energy-matter, as Isaac Asimov's `The Collapsing Universe' was to the nature of collapsars.<br /><br />In particular, Prof. Krauss' chapters 1-8 give a superb and understandable overview of current cosmology and its basic findings, in much the same way that Asimov's chapters 1-7 did for collapsars. And - like Asimov- Krauss keeps the mathematics andgraphs to a minimum (which some may find fault with but I regard as barely a minor quibble).<br /><br />A major eye-opener for me appeared in Chapter 5, page 82 wherein Krauss' noted Saul Perlmutter's group \\"publishing a paper confirming the High-Z supernova result....in effect acknowledging their earlier error.\\" This information was greatly appreciated since all I'd been familiar with was Perlmutter's article 'Supernovae, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe', in Physics Today, April, 2003, p. 53. But I don't recall any errors being mentioned....so Krauss' chapter provides a critical historical background and the knowledge that Perlmutter wasn't always on board with the High-Z community.<br /><br />In the last chapter, on `Brave New Worlds', I'd liked to have seen more discussion of quantum gravity- incepted universe models and less of the \\"multiverse\\" - which I confess, I am not a fan of.  A future book, then, might examine in more detail the implications of the proposed hypothesis by T Padmanabhan, `Universe Before Planck Time - A Quantum Gravity Model, in Physical Review D, Vol. 28, No. 4, p. 756.<br /><br />The paper argues for  the instantaneous formation of the universe by a possible quantum fluctuation arose when the conformal part of space-time is treated as a quantum variable. Without going into all the complex mathematics entailed, Padmanabhan employed integrals related to the action (J) as a function of time. He proceeded by solving for the expansion factor S(t) using two separate energy equations, one of which (2.15 in his paper) bears a remarkable resemblance to the basic quantum wave potential equation. The potential energy term is remarkably similar to that for the quantum harmonic oscillator.<br /><br />The conformal factor Padmanabhan uses is \\"alpha\\", which is a purely quantum mechanical parameter, defined from his equation (2.24):<br /><br />alpha = S^ 6 (t) (omega)^ 2 (t)<br /><br />thereby fixing the state of the universe to be compatible with a harmonic oscillator of frequency alpha. (Which we know has solutions in terms of Hermite polynomials H_n (q)) To make a long story short, and leave out lots of formalism, he then considers a series of different solutions for the respective energy equations, including for an \\"open\\", \\"flat\\" and \\"closed\\" model cosmos. It's found all the spacetimes are non-singular (e.g don't have an associated singularity or infinity) and initiate with some minimum value of expansion factor. \\"Classical\\" (non-quantum) limits are achieved by setting alpha = 0, thus S(t) = 0.<br /><br />Physically, it is found that the conformal factor (alpha) contributes a negative energy density.  The point is, the metric and treatment is feasible since non-trivial and matterless solutions exist. Thus, the cosmos can be incepted and proceed to expand because of the negative-energy density of the conformal factor.<br /><br />For those who wish, a more up to date rendering is available in Luciano Boi's book: 'The Quantum Fluctuation' (2011, Johns Hopkins University Press) who shows the link between quantum tunneling and cosmic inception. As he observes, in relation to a particular tunneling model of Vilenkin (p. 11):<br /><br />\\"The state of tunneling is thus an analogue of the Big Bang, according to the definition that the universe began neither at nor after the singularity, for the tunneling itself is the first state of the universe and there is no time before this state.\\"<br /><br />But as I said, these issues are of minor import right now compared to the high import of having a text like this available now to the general public. Because of the importance of these issues, especially to refute the creationist-ID lobby, I award Krauss' book five stars. It was an excellent read, there are quibbles here and there, but overall this is a book whose time has come and it is gratifying to see the Director of the Arizona State University's Origins Project doing it.<br /><br />One unmistakable fact as I read through Krauss' book, is that it belongs on the shelves of every skeptical, critically thinking cosmology enthusiast, as much as Victor Stenger's 'Not By Design', Stephen Hawking's and Leonard Mlodinow's 'Grand Design' and Jagjit Singh's 'Great Ideas and Theories of Modern Cosmology'!graphs to a minimum (which some may find fault with but I regard as barely a minor quibble).<br /><br />A major eye-opener for me appeared in Chapter 5, page 82 wherein Krauss' noted Saul Perlmutter's group \\"publishing a paper confirming the High-Z supernova result....in effect acknowledging their earlier error.\\" This information was greatly appreciated since all I'd been familiar with was Perlmutter's article 'Supernovae, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe', in Physics Today, April, 2003, p. 53.

Without going into all the complex mathematics entailed, Padmanabhan employed integrals related to the action (J) as a function of time. He proceeded by solving for the expansion factor S(t) using two separate energy equations, one of which (2.15 in his paper) bears a remarkable resemblance to the basic quantum wave potential equation. The potential energy term is remarkably similar to that for the quantum harmonic oscillator.<br /><br />The conformal factor Padmanabhan uses is \\"alpha\\", which is a purely quantum mechanical parameter, defined from his equation (2.24):<br /><br />alpha = S^ 6 (t) (omega)^ 2 (t)<br /><br />thereby fixing the state of the universe to be compatiblewith a harmonic oscillator of frequency alpha. (Which we know has solutions in terms of Hermite polynomials H_n (q)) To make a long story short, and leave out lots of formalism, he then considers a series of different solutions for the respective energy equations, including for an \\"open\\", \\"flat\\" and \\"closed\\" model cosmos. It's found all the spacetimes are non-singular (e.g don't have an associated singularity or infinity) and initiate with some minimum value of expansion factor. \\"Classical\\" (non-quantum) limits are achieved by setting alpha = 0, thus S(t) = 0.<br /><br />Physically, it is found that the conformal factor (alpha) contributes a negative energy density.  The point is, the metric and treatment is feasible since non-trivial and matterless solutions exist. Thus, the cosmos can be incepted and proceed to expand because of the negative-energy density of the conformal factor.<br /><br />For those who wish, a more up to date rendering is available in Luciano Boi's book: 'The Quantum Fluctuation' (2011, Johns Hopkins University Press) who shows the link between quantum tunneling and cosmic inception. As he observes, in relation to a particular tunneling model of Vilenkin (p. 11):<br /><br />\\"The state of tunneling is thus an analogue of the Big Bang, according to the definition that the universe began neither at nor after the singularity, for the tunneling itself is the first state of the universe and there is no time before this state.\\"<br /><br />But as I said, these issues are of minor import right now compared to the high import of having a text like this available now to the general public. Because of the importance of these issues, especially to refute the creationist-ID lobby, I award Krauss' book five stars. It was an excellent read, there are quibbles here and there, but overall this is a book whose time has come and it is gratifying to see the Director of the Arizona State University's Origins Project doing it.<br /><br />One unmistakable fact as I read through Krauss' book, is that it belongs on the shelves of every skeptical, critically thinking cosmology enthusiast, as much as Victor Stenger's 'Not By Design', Stephen Hawking's and Leonard Mlodinow's 'Grand Design' and Jagjit Singh's 'Great Ideas and Theories of Modern Cosmology'!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Never thought about seeing it from the other side. Who knows, maybe all the horror flicks are just a a bunch of misunderstandings?
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I ordered this case for my PS3.  I wanted a mobile gaming system bigger than my PSP to take on a military deployment.  This case is perfect.  It stores my PS3, cables, and controller.  The HDMI cable that is provided works perfect.  I love how portable this case is.  It was a little bigger than I was expecting, but I would still highly recommend this item.  I've had several people ask me where I bought it and want to get one for themselves.
0441013597|3.0|This was a great book in terms of the plot and such, but let's be honest here: this book is ugly.  Seriously, as soon as my divorce is finalized (of which I partially blame this book and others of the like) and I start dating again, I will destroy this book.  When I start bringing girls back to my apartment again, do I really want them to see this.  The girl will ask \\"Oh, I didn't know you were into Egyptology, that's hot.\\"<br />Then I'll have to say, \\"Nah, baby, that ain't about old Egypt; that's a science fiction epic about human houses several thousand years in the future fighting over control of a desert world that is infested with car-eating worms and Tuskan-raiders.\\"<br /><br />Also, the part about the worms was really lame.  Ripping off Star Wars isn't cool.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Fun game for my kids and me. I played it regularly with no problems.  It worked all right with my Asus Transformer (it had a few graphics issues from the beginning).

0140187537|5.0|Steinbeck has with this book achieved a rare feat.  He has conclusively demonstrated the impossibility of creating material success in a capitalist system and at the same time having sound morals.  Ethan realises that his cotownees are unwilling and unable to recognise the all-pervasive, evil American values preventing them from being better people.  This saddens and frustrates him.  His challenge is to find a way to retain his integrity while accommodating the desires of his family and the expectations of the capitalist system he finds so oppressive.  He cunningly nearly achieves this, with little compromise, though he saw his friend from school-days as a casualty of his actions.  In the end he feels his conscience is sullied, leaving any future for him fatally devalued, in his eyes. No wonder so many Americans didn't like it.  A brilliant novel.

0545425115|4.0|This was a strange book. It takes place in a future world where the characters leave little clues as to what happened in the past. I started reading this book I thought it was extremely weird. But Suzanne Collins does such a good job at teasing you with each chapter that you can't help but read it in a day. It is a fairly easy book so don't expect something amazing. I didn't give it a 5 because to get a 5 it would have to change my life. But it's an extremely entertaining book and series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just what I needed in these troubled times. The devolutions are fabulous. They help me start my day in the right way
1423140591|5.0|the first Percy Jackson series stands as some of the best books I've read, so I was really excited about the Heroes of Olympus series.  After a Percy Jackson-less first book (still good, but just not the same without the son of the sea god), this one was hugely satisfying.  I've enjoyed the addition of the Roman Mythologies to the series, the new characters are interesting, and best of all Percy Jackson!<br /><br />Without going into spoiler territory, the best part for me was the battle on the glacier.  Percy single-handedly fighting the army of ghosts, creating a hurricane around himself, before bringing the glacier down into the sea, only to easily survive and just shrug it off like it was no big deal!  Wonderful stuff!  If you haven't read Mr Riordan's books, you simply must.  This is series for young readers that adults can enjoy as well.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|The first time I saw AVATAR was when the rest of the world did, in the theaters in 3D.  Afterwards I was considerably underwhelmed by the super-hyped super-anticipated return to sci-fi by James Cameron.  It was the story that did me in, not the film-making itself:  Too rehashed, familiar, predictable, and unoriginal.  I was also pretty turned off by the only-a-white-man-in-natives'-skin-can-save-natives'-collective-skins subtext...<br /><br />A few years go by, all the while I'm trashing the flick whenever it comes up in conversation.  Then... something happens to someone close, something tragic.  This person held AVATAR in high regard and this was a person who's taste in art, particularly the art of film-making, I held in high regard.  On a very difficult day I was compelled to pick up the latest 3 disc blu-ray extended collects edition of AVATAR and gave it another go... And I was honestly blown away!  This was really surprising to me, having already seen this movie, one I'd found predictable before ever seeing before.  I was thrilled by the pacing (the extended cut really helps) but I was truly wowed by the artistry, production design, and imagination at work here.  The avatars and Na'vi performance capture (or \\"virtual make-up\\" as Cameron and others refer to it throughout the plentiful and satisfying supplemental docs, features, and extras) is absolutely astounding.  I suppose once I allowed myself the enjoy what AVATAR is and not focus on what it isn't I opened myself to the wildly bold film-making it really is.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to my third viewing.<br /><br />P.S.  Watching it on a 64\\" Samsung Plasma sure helps!  Breathtaking!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was a fascinating look into the life, attitudes, mores, and thinking of one of the most creative geniuses of our time.  No question he was a force of transformation in how we apply computers and communication devices to our every day lives.  This book was neither devotional nor exessively critical.  It is mostly from the point of people he interacted with - even his enemies (also those in his mind) gave Jobs his due.  There is much from Jobs's point of view, including a chance to respond to comments made about him or events (I strongly disagee with reviews that said there was too little from Jobs personally).  It is easy to see why Jobs chose Isaacson to write his story.  Very well done.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|although all games in this app are simple, they are interesting to play. also it's free and has a lot of games.
1451648537|5.0|This is a wonderful biography because it is not worshipful. Isaacson does not sugarcoat Jobs and because he didn't, his book is an exacting and credible portrait. Entertaining, educational and a joy to read, the author's unfettered access to Jobs, his colleagues, his family, and his competitors creates a rich, fast moving and genuine book with skillful use of Isaacson's exhaustive interviews. Steve Jobs was not a nice person, in fact he was maddeningly rude and even cruel to most everyone in his life, but he had a knack for focusing on what people wanted before they knew they wanted it, this served him well as Apple created its iconic and life-altering products. The company he created and re-created changed the world and he did it for the product not the money (as trite and ridiculous as that statement might sound, this book made me believe it).  Some of the interactions depicted including those between Jobs and Bill Gates and Jobs and the the designer Paul Rand are priceless and the insights into how Apple and its product were built are fascinating. If you have an interest in the technology revolution, business and the minds of geniuses this book is a must read. The most amazing thing about this book is, that while Isaacson presents enough information about Jobs to make me think Jobs was a jerk, in the end I wanted to stand and applaud him anyway.

B0064W652A|4.0|Summary Statement:Overall, this is a fantastic purchase.<br /><br />Even though I already have  a print version of the two trade volumes of Batman: Hush, but I bought this so I can look at it at my leisure, without having to break out said trades. This title is Gorgeous on the Kindle Fire and the automatic zoom in feature works very well.<br /><br />Cons: Unfortunately, here is where the loss of one star comes into play: you can neither add notes or bookmarks, Nor does the screen automatically adapt horizontal panels to fit longways on the Kindle. (Some of the opening story with Killer Croc would've been mind-blowing if this worked) This, while not a gamebreaker, definitely decreases the impact of the work. Also, the zoom feature doesn't always focus on the entire content of a page. For example, on the cover that shows Batman holding Catwoman's body and Harley Quinn in the background holding a gun, it only zooms in on Batman holding Selena. Finally, there's not too much in terms of extra artistic content as well so I'm not sure why it's called \\"The Complete Hush\\". While the technical drawbacks may be an issue that only I'm experiencing, they still detract from the reading experience.<br /><br />(Other)Pros: First and foremost, as mentioned before, portability is, to me, the best benefit of having this. I can read this wherever I am and easily show it off to those who haven't read it before (Hard to believe such people exist, I know :)). The section by Jim Lee that gives his perspective on the project and the mini bios on the creative team involved are a nice touch and I recommend that they be read. The art and storytelling are phenomenal and they go together extremely well. If you've never read Hush but have a Kindle Fire, or a Mac or PC for that matter, I'd say this is a must-have. If you already have one of the physical iterations of Hush, the degree of convenience and portability may be a deciding factor in whether or not you want to but it again. Good hunting, thanks for reading and enjoy this fantastic moment of Batman's history!hanks for reading and enjoy this fantastic moment of Batman's history!
B0068CEH5S|5.0|With the possible exception of LAURA (1944), I don't think that Otto Preminger ever directed a more riveting motion picture than ANATOMY OF A MURDER, which is also one of the best courtroom dramas ever made.<br /><br />The film, adapted from the best-selling novel by Robert Traver, was quite controversial when it was first released in 1959, primarily because the trial not only involved a first degree murder case, but also a brutal rape.  Though somewhat fictionalized, the case was based on a real incident, and Preminger chose to film his movie on the actual Michigan locations where the events took place.<br /><br />James Stewart starred as the defense attorney for Army lieutenant Ben Gazzara, on trial for shooting down the man who ostensibly raped his voluptuous wife (Lee Remick).  Also in the cast were Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden, George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton, Kathryn Grant and legendary attorney Joseph N. Welch, who plays the judge.  Duke Ellington composed the influential jazz score.<br /><br />Granted, the film does move along at a slightly deliberate pace, but unlike flashier courtroom movies, this one has the ring of truth about it.<br /><br />ANATOMY OF A MURDER was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture.  Unfortunately, 1959 was also the year of BEN-HUR.<br /><br /> The 2-disc DVD from The Criterion Collection not only features a new digital restoration of the film and an alternate 5.1 soundtrack, but there are also interviews with Preminger biographer Foster Hirsch, music critic Gary Giddens on the Ellington score; excerpts from a 1957 Preminger interview with William F. Buckley Jr., a booklet that includes essays on both Preminger and Welch and much more.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I noticed alot of people who had force close problems on the evo. I'm using an evo and it worked great. Are you up to date on the htc software? The game was good for the type of game. I'd prefer more control over the ship movement and firing.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|To be breif, this is a great product. It is lightweight, strong an well designed. Other reviewers felt it might be flimsie. It isn't. It is made with modern materials that need not be heavy and bulky to be strong and lightweight. Great product to protect a great product.

1604680547|5.0|This book is a great place to get inspiration for picking a design quilting your next quilt.  The designs run the gamut from tradition (think feathers) to kids to floral and there's a great variety of themes.  They also show you how to turn and/or combine the patters to create even more possibilities.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Don't do it! Don't waste your money like I did. I got these headphones and wasn't even able to listen to ONE song!!! Not one song! That's because they NEVER worked. I opened the package and plugged them into my ipod and nothing! Not to mention I could barely get the thing to fit on my head. I contacted the seller to see if we could arrange something before I gave them a negative review and they never responded to my email and I gave them 2 weeks. Just don't waste your money like I did.
1594744769|5.0|Received the book immediately with several others I had ordered. Really enjoyed it.  The photographs are amazing and add alot to the story.  It was exciting and entertaining .  The ending was not disappointing and made me want to continue following the aharacters.  Had to share it with friends.
0451169514|5.0|This is my second time through It and I must say that I found as much joy the second time around as the first. It is, in my opinion, King's most complete novel to date. He has created and fleshed out some of the best characters in all of his works and draws the reader into their lives almost completely. They, as both children and adults, are all compelling each in their own way.<br /><br />Even with the length of the novel, which is considerable, King has done such a nice job of interspersing back-story and explanatory plot points with tense and frightening moments that I never really found a spot that felt too long and drawn-out. There are plenty of creepy moments, gore and sheer terror for the avid horror buff along with the humor, hope and touching moments that really help to connect the reader to the characters in a way that many authors never really achieve.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that It is one of Stephen King's best novels and belongs in the conversation with The Stand and The Shining as his best overall stand-alone master work. I would recommend It to those who are not very familiar with King as an easy book to get into, just don't be too intimidated by its massive size. Definitely worth the price of admission!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|WORST APP EVER!!!!!! All I like is the cool picture on the front. But other than that it is terrible.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so great kids would love it.get this app its fun and easy.your kids will like this game and its the best for kids.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Wasn't especially interested in horse racing, but as so many others, I became caught up in the nobility of Secretariat.  The awe and thrill of watching the race live in 1973, and now having access to the story behind 'Red' on DVD is pure pleasure.  If I'm feeling a bit down, and my heart needs to sing, this is one of the DVD's I reach for.  Thank you 'Red' for your love of life, and thank you Penny Tweedy for allowing him the opportunity to be himself.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Really like this game....lots to do. The downside is the time it takes to unlock all of the games. Would definately recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Standard solitaire with great features and free!  What else could you ask for to put your mind on cruise control and block out your problems?
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game would rate 5 stars if Popcap games would give us the Zen garden and other minigames. Having the last update completely wipe my progress and achievements doesn't help either. Maybe time for a refund?
B006JSXYPA|5.0|this is a must-own bluray. looks killer and sounds incredible. definitely a great way to show off your system and the story resonates with our current economic and political problems when it feels like evil has already won.

B000WC3A0S|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my cousin, who's a big fan of the Rocky series. He was thrilled to receive the dvd's, and he said they came in excellent shape. Thank you.
B0045OHUNM|5.0|This is a strange album, with an unusual sound, and yet very balanced and listenable. I have found no bad songs, no filler. It's at once ethereal, industrial, dark and danceable. Definitely not a flash in the pan, as Claire Boucher's other albums are also very good.<br />I came to know Grimes through a mention from Austra, another outstanding Canadian group. Both groups share a certain classical veneer to electro pop, but come from different angles.<br />Watch some of the videos too. These guys have a sense of humor!
B0043URV5U|5.0|What can I say about Bob, I don't think he has ever made a bad song. This is full of hit after hit. You will not regret getting it, if you like Seger. Amazon always seems to have the best prices and super fast service.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|For those of you who are complaining about iLOK website not recognizing your software may due to using Google chrome or Opera. When i used Internet Explorer, it worked like a charm. Easy to install and use unless your PC is really cheap and messed up.

B0063GORYU|4.0|it's very addictive. I cant put it down. I like it much more than any regular card games. I recommend it to anyone.
0061726834|5.0|I've read alot of books, but usually don't have time to review. I only make time when I really really enjoy a book or I really dislike it :) I can't imagine living in a society where love is considered to be an illness! I thought the fever series had the worst cliff hangers. Well, Moning has met her match LOL. I hate cliff hangers, but I still really enjoyed the series. Two more days for the next book :)

B004XIZN5M|5.0|I have been weight training for 26 years.  Now in my 40's I recently decided to simplify my life and sold off much of my gym equipment (I had a considerable amount) retaining only the basics to do power lifting movements such as: squats, deads, snatch, clean/press, bench, etc.  I have had injuries in the past from working out (knee, back, & shoulder), and in the last few months I reinjured my shoulder.  The thought occurred to me that I could further simplify my workouts, and reduce the chance of injury, by removing weight training completely.  I began researching information on bodyweight training.  I researched several books on Amazon & several health/fitness forums.  Convict Conditioning was the book I chose based on all the feedback I collected.<br /><br />I purchased the book about two weeks ago and read it in five days.  When researching Convict Conditioning the main negative I found was folks complaining about the &#34;prison&#34; aspect of the book.  I saw some reviews which commented about how the prison related stories were false and that Coach Wade was most likely a fictitious character.  Personally, I dismissed the prison aspects of the book as marketing hype and focused on the training material (these days you need some kind of marketing angle to get your product noticed by the right crowd).  The information is excellent.  The exercise progression is worth the price of the book (I purchased the Kindle edition for under $20).  It starts off with exercises which are very easy on the body (My elderly, overweight, diabetic, triple bypass, high blood pressure, father could follow this program without risk of injury).  This was key for me.  I am looking to workout with little to no risk of injury...and, hopefully, to strengthen previously injured joints to prevent future injury.<br /><br />I have been following the plan for almost 2 weeks.  I am on level 3 of pushups and squats, level 2 of pull-ups, and still on level 1 of leg lifts (my abs are obviously weaker than I realized).  Per the recommendation in the book I will hold off on bridges and handstand pushups until I am further along with the other 4 movements.<br /><br />So far I love this workout!  I can work out right in my living room, during commercial breaks, for most exercises (except for pull ups).  The workouts are short and simple.  I am building &#34;functional&#34; strength... as well as &#34;demonstrate-able&#34; strength (In the future I can easily demonstrate my strength by dropping and doing one arm pushups, or pistol squats...I'm certainly not above doing a little showing off.)  I no longer have the fear of injury while doing these exercises.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to buying Convict Conditioning 2 (when a Kindle edition is available - Which I hope will be VERY soon.) so, someday, I can start working on doing &#34;Flags&#34; (talk about demonstrate-able strength!!).<br /><br />3/5/13 Update:  I've been following the program for over a year and I still love it.  I reached the master phase for leg raises about a month ago.  As of today I can do 1 hand pushups on the floor, but my feet are not together yet...I am still working on that.  I figure I'm still 6 months to a year away from reaching the master phase of squats (due to lack of ankle flexibility) and pull ups (still need to develop more strength).  I am probably at least 2 years away from the master phase for bridges and hand stand pushups.<br /><br />I have had no injuries since starting the program.  I feel strong and my wife has commented that I have gained muscle mass.  The pain I had in my knee, back and shoulder have faded away over the last year (that alone was worth 50 times the price of the book).<br /><br />I love the ongoing challenge of slowly (and safely) working my way through the progression.  I purchased Convict Conditioning 2 and read it, but I won't start working on those exercises until I have mastered pushups, pull ups, squats, and leg lifts from the first book.<br /><br />I don't miss weight training.  I wish I had a book like this when I was a teenager.<br /><br />9/22/2014 Update:  I've been following the program for over 2 years now.  I have also begun to incorporate other gymnastics movements into the my routine.<br /><br />Pushups:  I have been doing great with 1 arm pushups, but as many others have found, doing them with the feet together seems nearly impossible.  Instead I am doing 1 arm/1 leg pushups.<br />Pull Ups:  I still haven't mastered 1 arm pull ups.  I am still working with one hand on a low towel and archer pull ups.<br />Leg Raises:  I mastered the straight leg raises and have moved on to Dragon Flags (not mentioned in the book).<br />Pistol Squats:  Due to lack of ankle tendon flexibility I have struggled with pistols.  However, I am very close to doing my first pistol squat with my heal on a 1 inch block.  I can squat down very slowly, and then give myself a slight push off the floor and stand back up.  I expect I will get my first pistol very soon.<br />Bridges:  I have stuck with doing bridges for sets of 10 reps (stage 5).  I am in no hurry to get to the master phase of this exercise.  I will focus on it when I've mastered the core 4 exercises.<br />Hand Stand Push Ups:  I am doing handstand pushups regularly.  It will be quite a while before I can do a 1 arm hand stand push up.<br /><br />I am still injury free and my joints still feel great (I am 45 years old).  The combination of the Paleo/Primal lifestyle and the calisthenic has added a bit more muscle mass in the chest/back/arm/shoulder areas (haven't noticed much gain in the legs).<br /><br />I recently purchased &#34;Complete Calisthenics:  The Ultimate Guide to Bodyweight Exercise&#34; by Ashley Kalym.  This book has similar progressions to Convict Conditioning but includes several gymnastics exercises (Levers, Planche, Human Flag, etc).  I am incorporating some of the routines in this book into my weekly schedule.<br /><br />I still don't miss weight training.  For me Calisthenics have given me much better results without the injuries/aches and pains.<br /><br />11/5/2015 Brief Update:  I am doing freestanding pistol squats (with my heal on a 1/2 block) regularly.  I'm still a long way off from doing 1 arm pull ups & 1 arm handstand push ups.  I am doing bridges for reps (bridge push ups) with my feet raised 6 inches off the floor (on a bar on the on my power rack) which work the back of the shoulders very well and give me a great back stretch.  I can do very high leg raises (touch toes to the bar) at this point, plus I'm doing dragon flags. I am still injury free and feeling great.  I am doing a mix of other body weight exercise along with the CC workouts.  I am now doing 1 arm push ups with my feet on a 10&#34; block as well as 1 arm/1 leg push ups.<br /><br />6/10/2016 Update:  This may be my last update.  As my workout routine evolves I continue to expand my routine with new exercises.  However, I cannot say enough good things about this book.  It was, for the most part, the start of my body weight training journey which I know I will continue for the rest of my life.  I will keep working toward 1 arm pull ups.  I don't worry about 1 arm handstand push ups.  I recommend this book often to people with whom I talk about health and fitness.  I'm 47 years old now.  I'm lean and strong and will remain this way for a very long time, thanks in part to the information provided in this book.  Advice to anyone just starting out:  Stick with it.  The system works well and will improve your life.r />I don't miss weight training.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is awesome. I bought my wife the verso artist series cover for her kindle fire. I really thought it was a good quality cover then. She is really rough with her devices and it has stood up to her abuse. I bought the brown one for myself recently and I really am pleased with both of them. My advice to all of you is to pick one up for yourself you wont regret it. The cover fits the kindle fire perfectly.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|For baby boomers, these are the songs of our parents' era, an era we were all too happy to distance ourselves from. Or just hate outright. But of course, the Beatles, as war babies, were a bit older and a bit more steeped in the kind of crooner-ish tunes Paul selects for this album. All I can say is--thank God for John Lennon; at one point Paul dragged John to a Rodgers and Hammerstein production but John, thank heaven, couldn't bear to sit through it. John's allegiance to rock 'n' roll saved Paul from a Barry Maniow-ish trajectory and Paul in turn saved John from becoming the Fugs. That said, Paul does resurrect some worthy songs here that I'd never heard before, such as 'We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me)' and 'My Very Good Friend the Milkman', each a clever idea elaborated with clever lyrics. I believe Paul & Krall do justice to the lot, and provide an elegant window to songcraft of the first half of the 20th century. As for Paul's contributions to the genre, 'My Valentine' is pretty slight and not anywhere near as clever as the songs he covers, but it's rather nice nonetheless. As for 'Only Our Hearts'--too much of an un-clever over-earnest croonfest for me. Fast forward to its Stevie Wonder harmonica solo, which sounds a little too modern to fit with the album's theme, but it's still a goodie. On the whole, I suppose the album was worth doing. Seems Paul is intent on giving every genre a shot so I guess this was inevitable. Sigh. It's perhaps our misfortune that the man is too multi-talented to content himself with doing only what he does best. I hate to have to say it, Paul, but 'Penny Lane' is better and more exciting than all the songs on this CD combined.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have discovered a lot of great science fiction books here on Amazon for the Kindle. This is by far one of the best. It is exceptionally well written, has a compelling story, fantastic characters, and was hard to put down.<br /><br />I read the Omnibus Edition after seeing the myriad of good reviews for the individual books as well as the overwhelmingly positive response for this compellation. I couldn't have been more pleased with the experience.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|A handy little app. It has a radar display,  weather videos, and weather news that I enjoyed in particular. Also has hour by hour forecasts.
B001EC3JME|4.0|This item does not work well with lights that have a switch button on the end. When placing the light in the holder, it turns on. You must place your finger in before the light in order to keep this from happening. Over all good product.
0385534639|2.0|I was so excited to read this book, the premise seemed original and promising.  Unfortunately it fell flat on all aspects except for its self-indulgent long drawn out details of the circus.  No real romance, no real contest, no real character development.  I totally agree with all of the other 2 star reviews here-- many eloquently stating how I felt after reading this book.  The only reason why I took time to write my own review was to add to the 2 star numbers on Amazon.  I wanted other people to know the publicity and hype for this book totally out shadowed its ability to deliver.  I kept reading the book in hopes it would get better, but the plot and the characters remained as monotone as the color of the circus!  Sooooo very disappointed :-(<br /><br />What I thought was a MAJOR flaw in the book:<br />----------------------------SPOILER ALERT---------------------------------------------<br />The Night Circus was created as a venue for a competition, to the DEATH, between Marco and Celia.  Yet, neither of them know exactly what the competition is, or do we as the reader.  We only know that someone must die in order for the other one to win.  So how is it possible for one of them to die? It appears only through someone actually killing their opponent or committing suicide themselves.  Then how is that a competition?  Marco is hardly ever around the actual circus for him to get killed. And the author never explains how, if he Marco isn't at the circus, he builds the new rooms/tents.  Is the author being vague because she doesn't know how to explain these things?  As the competition goes on, it doesn't seem to be hurting either opponent (only the circus members) - when Marco designs an ice room Celia finds joy in the room and loves to spend her free time there.  How is that hurting her?  Bottom line, I feel like the author spends all of her effort in describing the circus and use the crutch of being \\"vague\\" to skirt the real development of the remaining aspects of the story.<br />---------------------------Spoiler Alert over-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />All the above said, I DO think this book has the possibilities of becoming a very enchanting movie.  Movies are so visually based now days, which could capitalize on the major strength of this book--the intricate visual detail about the circus.  Also, a very talented screenwriter could give the much needed depth to the very shallowly written characters.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok not too bad little annoying with the ads. but hey its free no need to complain. love sushi game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it so much and it Is fun to play in the car and my baby brow loves it
B0058VW36U|5.0|This was my first Kindle Fire game purchase and I did not regret buying it either. After the first two or three stage, this game became pretty addictive to say the least. My nephew who's 6 loves it and it gave him a lot of challenging problem and a good degree of obstacles. Great for kids to learn some problem solving skills.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My kids love it! They love the variety of games. The games kept them entertained on long road trips and stuffy waiting rooms.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this. App. I have my Bible with me all the time. Many many versions.  You can even download your favorite for when you are out of range of wifi.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Just got this in the mail today, works like a charm on my Ipad.<br /><br />Both the USB and SD connections work for pictures taken on my Sony A55 camera.<br /><br />It's really nice to be able to shoot pictures and then transfer them to the Ipad (which is much lighter than my computer and fits in my camera bag) so that I can see them larger than the camera LCD allows.<br /><br />Great Product, buy it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great, addicting game! Glad I downloaded it. Definitely worth getting and it is free so that makes it even better.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I really thought this was going to be \\"the typical\\" movie where someone gets divorced and the resulting story lines remain predictable. Boy, was I surprised. I really loved this film, mostly because it kept surprising me. All the actors do their parts justice, and while there were one or two parts I absolutely cringed at and thought should be edited out, I'm giving this five stars because it is so atypical of a movie you will definitely be entertained.
1934429821|4.0|I absolutely love this book.  I would have given 5 stars if it was a larger in size.  It is approximately 4\\" H and 8\\" W.  There are many illustrations present.<br />The illustrations are fabulous and varied.  The book is organized well and grouped in categories.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|This had been on my \\"to watch\\" list for about ten years. I'm slow, I know. But I'm glad I finally got to it, because it was really a lovely movie. I was drawn in from the first minute and so impressed with the acting talent. It's difficult to make an impact as an actor and still be understated, and yet everyone in this film seemed to pull it off effortlessly. Excellent screen adaption, and worth seeing.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|Bluray disk at a great price for a popular movie. If you like twilight movies, you cannot go wrong at this price.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a very fun arcade shooter that is remanicent of 80s space alien games. The action is fast paced bit forgiving to very casual play. Lots of weapon upgrades to choose from.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Most of the low ratings for this app seem to concern problems with somebody's device, not the quality of the actual game itself! Firstly, I can tell you that this gem runs perfectly on the HTC Merge. Secondly, it provides an entertaining and at-times satirical narrative for classic arcade hits like Asteroids, Centipede, and Space Invaders. Stringing these games together with an unobtrusive electronica background and colorful pixel mashups of the original arcade graphics, the storyline and dialogue comes right from the pages of those old Atari manuals--you know, the B-movie descriptions of scenarios and worlds that simply couldn't be conveyed on screen back in the day, so the developers had to write them in the user guides? The storyline is hardly ingenious, but its lighthearted jokes at the player and CPU, combined with such entrancing visual quality, gives Radiant HD a high replay value. Reviewers who can't appreciate these inside jokes and, for that matter, the addictive simplicity of the games themselves, will be disappointed in the apparent shallowness. For someone like myself, however, it's a breath of air amidst the crowd of cartoon, commercialized apps.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|As I peruse the reviews here, I see one theme among them: many people saying the plot doesn't progress far. And while I will give them that, I find this slow plot progression necessary for the next two books. Feast and Dance are both setup books. They set the scene for the future books. Many reviews also talk about unneccesary details, but I find they are very necessary. These detailed descriptions does nothing but enriches this vibrant world. These things could only be seen by a true lover of fantasy. Go back to the tween books if you want no description all plot progression books. This book is for those who can appreciate stopping and smelling the roses.
B002VUFKG6|3.0|I was a big fan of Elizabeth Gilbert's, \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" and hoped that \\"Committed: A Love Story\\" would be as engaging and inspiring as her first work.  Unfortunately for me, I was left uninspired.<br /><br />I started reading this book prior to my wedding a few months back, and didn't become engrossed with it as quickly as I had with EPL.  So, I put it to the side and figured I'd read it later - perhaps after the wedding, when I had a bit more time.<br /><br />Fast forward to my post-nuptual bliss, and thinking that perhaps I would gain some helpful newlywed insight from Ms. Gilbert, I resurrected the book from the boxes I had packed for a move across country and delved back in.<br /><br />What I found was an exhaustive repartee from the author, who - I feel - lost the soulfulness from \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" and was just trying to crank out a very personal narrative of her marriage and life, dotted with some anthropological references.  It just didn't speak to me.<br /><br />Indeed, in the prologue she says that she wrote this book \\"exactly for twenty seven readers\\" - her closest friends.  And it reads like it.  It's very intimate, very chatty (to use a previous reviewers word) and very redundant in certain parts.  So much so that about halfway through the book, I just couldn't go any further.  Hardly do I ever just stop reading a novel.  But when it just isn't delivering what I hoped it would, I feel that it's not worth my time.

B000002B5L|5.0|Before this album came out, I had already heard of the Fugees. I knew they were really good but I had no idea that they were that good.<br />Lauryn Hill was indeed the true revelation of the album. Wyclef and Praz are not bad at all respectively but Lauryn was the star. As good in rapping as in singing.<br />It makes pretty much every single track a gem.<br />Do I recommend to buy this album 15 years later? Without a doubt! This album is timeless!

B004LWZW8I|2.0|I just saw this movie not too long ago. It was exactly what I expected, that is, only the last few minutes was actually worth watching. It was not as good as 300, but lets face it, 300 wasn't that good anyways. It pretty much starts out with a lame God-type-of-story, and everyone was preparing for some large scale battle. There are plenty of blood, not much sex, not enough action, and the storyline was just a fill-in, kinda like a video game. The action was great. The scenery was great, although probably not realistic. You can tell there's a lot of GCI that went into making this movie. That said, I think it is still worth watching at least once if you like action movies. If you're looking for a real story, don't waste your time here.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Me and my partner really love this movie. This is a true love story but happens to be two gay men who fall in love and start to build a life together and provides shelter to a young child and form a family. This is a sweet movie with all the flavors of romance. I think that this movie would be good to viewers gay or straight because a love story is just that no matter what the gender is and the story line could apply to all. I highly recommend this movie especially if you are in the mood for something other than your typical sex gay movie, those are fine too but it is good to have variety in your DVD selection of gay movies.<br /><br />Fitz,Washington D.C.

B007E6Z94U|5.0|One change to this episode and I would have to give it the highest rating.  I am a fan of this series.  It is now great enough to be considred one of the all time classics of Sci-Fi TV. It will be the next TOS or Twilight Zone if they upgrade to a few different settings. Its now been TEN episodes on Hershel's place. I hope they get to the prison soon or maybe a military base. Please look for the \\"Was this review helfpul to you.\\" statement and then click the yes button.

1609611543|4.0|We were amazed from the first chapter.  If you want to improve your health, this book is a good start, but not an easy one to follow.  We do like our favorite foods and when you learn the proven facts explained in such detail, it would be stupid not to try to improve.  It has been a subject of conversation on several occasions with friends and they really are interested in what we share.  Our family is making some immediate diet changes!
B0058VW36U|3.0|I played this on my friend's kindle fire and I loved it! Although I wish it was free or I would have rated it 5 stars... does anybody know if there is a free version? Anyways, it's a really addicitng game. You should totally get it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I do not read horror, because I don't like it. But I read Stephen King's THE SHINING, because I'd read his book ON WRITING and I wanted to see what he was like as a writer.<br /><br />I can't say that I enjoyed reading it, because explicit scenes of death and destruction just don't appeal to me. But I could see what a good writer King is. I was surprised to see how much his technique of suspense rests of foreshadowing. Much of this comes from the point of view of Danny, the 5-year-old son of Jack Torrance, who signs on to be the housekeeper of the Overlook Hotel one winter. Of course, Danny can't understand what his gift \\"the shining\\" shows him. So the foreshadowing is necessarily blurry and vague. But that is what drives the novel, of this scared young boy seeing things he can't understand. Throw into the mix a recovering alcoholic with a dangerous temper, and you have great material for conflict. But King doesn't stop there. His imagination soars as we gradually realize that the hotel is a personage as well.<br /><br />If you are a horror aficionado, and you've never read this, you owe it to yourself to do so. Five stars.
B005HSL626|5.0|My favorite game on my kindle fire! Its so fun! Not to brag but I unlocked all the blades and backgrounds on it. But sadly my high score is only 559 on arcade mode.:( see, its so good I cant stop talking about it. Anyways its a very fun and addicting game I love the different modes and how you can unlock blades and stuff. This game is definetly not just slicing fruit, you get extra points for slicing 3 in a row. Also, in arcade mode there is 3 sparkling bannanas that if you slice them something very cool will happen you just have to buy the app to find out. And lastly, there is one fruit that is 50 stinkin' points! Its called the dragon fruit and its ultra rare it only comes up every once in a while! Ive only got it once!!!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I need to preface this by saying that - as an older man with two grown daughters - I am not a fan of the movies foisted upon our youth in this day and age. I must, however, confess that I watched - and admittedly enjoyed - many teen films released in the 80's. Unfortunately, I now find it very hard to even consider sitting through the re-hashed, cliched, gratuitously raunchy production-line \\"comedies\\" geared to the younger audience these days. Sadly, if it doesn't contain a combination of acted-out skits using toilet humor, really bad jokes (some of which are before MY time), graphic sex and the obligatory R-rating, as PG will surely deter interest among the teen masses - which equates to smaller box-office revenue, etc. But I digress... Anyway, so I'm cable-surfing one night and land on a funny scene, to which my info showed was \\"Easy A.\\" It made me laugh, so I quickly pulled it up On Demand, and I'm glad I did. I don't normally write reviews here, but feel compelled to share some thoughts on this film... and especially, its Star. One thing I will NOT do is describe the film scene-by-scene or explain the plot... that's why we watch them instead of reading the script.<br /><br />\\"Easy A\\" provides a thoroughly refreshing escape from most current teen films by raising the bar and delivering those \\"old-fashioned\\" elements that were essential to making a good film. You know, those seemingly-forgotten little things like clever dialogue, near-perfect casting and interesting character interaction. Plus, as an added bonus, an eloquently flawless performance provided by the relatively (but temporarily) unknown Emma Stone, as the witty, dry, sarcastic - yet lovable and humble - Olive Penderghast. These rarely-applied film characteristics, along with many obvious (and some obscure) references, which range from the ostracism of Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" (plus the horrific Demi Moore \\"film\\" version) to a handful of those aforementioned 80's films, combine to make this film a true pleasure for anyone who enjoys an entertaining movie experience. My Amazon order for the \\"Easy A\\" DVD will be sent out first thing tomorrow. A superb, witty script placed in the hands of a cast including Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden-Church, Malcolm McDowell, Lisa Kudrow and rising-star Emma Stone definitely make this a film to enjoy multiple times.<br /><br />Allow me to reflect on Emma Stone's performance in this - her first true leading role - along with what I've seen in her limited screen time to date. Considering her work in this film, I'm convinced that with proper guidance and management, she will swiftly rise to stardom and generate much demand. I strongly believe this because her unique style somewhat resembles the classic, old-school female performers from Hollywood's Golden Age, although I won't get ahead of myself and go so far as to unfairly compare her with anyone in particular from that era. I will say that she carries a strong, natural screen presence and shares many character traits with those legendary stars. Things such as great timing with comedic banter (which is quite difficult and rare today) and the humility to sound, look and act foolish onscreen. These things may seem trite, but many past and present actors couldn't pull-off the former, and wouldn't stoop to the latter.<br /><br />The Academy recognition of \\"The Help\\" surely won't hurt, nor will her role as Gwen Stacy in the upcoming Summer blockbuster \\"The Amazing Spider-Man.\\" Keep your eye on Emma Stone... 'cause she'll be coming soon to a theater near you.to make this film a true pleasure for anyone who enjoys an entertaining movie experience.

0316044695|5.0|This book is about Chris Kyle's awesome yet humble tales of him and his boys doing work over in Iraq. The book is filled with tons of \\"off the record\\" information that made it very personable and let you into the real life of a SEAL. Although the book contains many of his stories about sniping in Iraq, it is also full of patriotism for his country, love for his family, and hilarious moments of morale building with his team. I would recommend this read to anyone!

0385737955|2.0|The first hurdle I had to overcome was the odd language Dashner had created for the Gladers. I don't feel like it added anything to the plot, and after learning that they had only been Gladers for about 2 years, I couldn't understand how they had come to adopt such strange terms (\\"clunker\\", \\"shankface\\"). Thomas, though unable to remember much about his life prior to the Glade, managed to speak without the weird language nuances (at first) and as he began to adopt more of them, I found it harder to lose myself in the story; I spent a lot of time wondering why they were speaking so annoyingly childish.<br /><br />Next came the frustrating secrecy about how the Glades functioned and why they had certain rules (like why only the Runners were allowed out in the Maze). I couldn't understand why someone wouldn't just explain things to Thomas be done with it; instead we were forced to listen to Thomas ask the same questions over and over, and listen to the same answer of \\"you'll find out eventually\\". I feel like withholding information was a tool used by Dashner to create suspense and conflict, and all it did was make for very slow pacing in many sections.<br /><br />Speaking of slow pacing, the lack of character development made for an emotionless read which only added to my sense of Dashner drawing out the story. Dashner spent so much time telling me how Thomas felt, versus allowing me to experience how Thomas was feeling, that I had a hard time relating to him. Many of his reactions confused me and made it impossible for me to identify with him. I was also left extremely frustrated with Teresa's character. As the only female present in the majority of the novel, she should have been a well-developed and strong character. Instead, she is merely a \\"very pretty\\" face, brought in, I assume, to again add suspense and conflict. I didn't see the need for Teresa, and since Dashner spent no time developing her character, I was unable to identify with her either. At the end of the day, I just didn't care what happened to Thomas, Teresa, or any of the Gladers (except for maybe Chuck).<br /><br />My biggest problem with the Maze Runner however, was definitely Dashner's completely underwhelming and disappointing solution to the Maze. Having Thomas conveniently remember bits and pieces, and then ultimately figure out everything (the way he did) after having only been in the Glades for about a week was the biggest cop-out I've ever read. I wanted to see Thomas overcome obstacles, and persevere through failure to come to conclusions on his own, using his intellect. I did not want it spoon-fed to him on a silver platter, virtually risk free. But, this ties in to the lack of character development, which seems to be Dashner's theme. So I guess I can't be too surprised by the completely unsatisfying conclusion to the Maze.day, I just didn't care what happened to Thomas, Teresa, or any of the Gladers (except for maybe Chuck).<br /><br />My biggest problem with the Maze Runner however, was definitely Dashner's completely underwhelming and disappointing solution to the Maze.

B0034G4P94|2.0|This movie had many things that bugged me.  Someone recommended this because I like watching UFC but the MMA in this isn't particularly compelling.  The problem with the fights is the camera work.  I don't think any of the punches actually get completely shown.  They either show just the guy throwing punches or just the other guy taking flailed punches from an unseen attacker.  The fence is always in the way and it feels like they've intentionally kept most of the action only half frame.  UFC had the smart idea of putting camera men up on the fence...  The whole movie is shot in a shaky, hand-cam style, often from a slightly too low angle looking up at the characters.  (Or maybe it just seems like a low angle to me because I'm not really short.)<br /><br />The MMA matches are inaccurate.  Or maybe the rules are different than what I'm used to.  It's my understanding that you have to intelligently defend yourself at all times.  At least a few rounds in this movie end with one guy pummeling another guy who just lays there and eats it until he gets saved by the bell.  Any ref would stop that after like 5 seconds.  Also, while it's called a choke hold, it doesn't cut off your air, it cuts off blood to the head.  Properly applied (and this one looked pretty deep), this will knock you out very quickly.  You certainly don't have 30 seconds to \\"just hold on\\" until the end of the round.  The submissions in this movie involve more dramatic straining and pulling than I've ever seen.  It's really a matter of leverage.  Only if you're doing the hold wrong would you have to pull super hard.<br /><br />Going into a MMA match without a support team is the height of idiocy.  Luckily most of that guy's matches didn't last the whole first round or you'd see him sitting there like an idiot between rounds.  Where's he going to get water?  Ice?  Clean up any cuts?  Well I guess that character wasn't super intelligent anyway.<br /><br />My final criticism is that in one of the early scenes the physics teacher has a student demonstrate breaking a piece of wood with a bat. He tells the class \\"if you have enough acceleration you might have a chance of breaking the object at rest.\\"  This is absolute nonsense.  He's trying to teach F=MA; he should say \\"if you have a strong enough force\\".  And the baseball bat is a terrible example of a force anyway because it's not accelerating, it hits with a specific velocity.  Way to confuse the students!  I'm glad he got suspended from teaching, he's a horrible teacher.  On that note, can you really suspend a teacher for competing in a MMA match on his own time?  That seems unlikely.  Don't teachers have unions?  I guess it's about as unlikely as a physics teacher in MMA in the first place.<br /><br />If you can get past these specific criticisms the rest is sort of a low budget, less compelling Rocky.
0385534639|5.0|There are three different story lines happening throughout The Night Circus. First is that of the circus, mainly Celia and Marco, the two magicians/illusionists pitted against each other from childhood as competitors in a game and their additions of different magical attractions, in an attempt to outdo one another. Secondary is that of a young Massachusetts farm boy and his fascination and delight with the traveling circus, and his budding friendship with some of the circus performers. The third (and this is the one that I was confused on for a bit) is you, the reader, as you explore and experience the circus during present day.<br /><br />I am in LOVE with this book. It has an ethereal feel to it, and every moment is described so elegantly that as I'm reading, I feel as though I am at the circus. Closing my eyes, I can smell the hot cider and caramel apples; I can see what the contortionist must look like as she closes herself into her glass box; I share in Celia's delight with the ice garden as it is my delight; I can feel the excitement of the crowd, as I am excited; I am truly experiencing the circus as though I am there.<br /><br />Each short captivating chapter adds a slight twist to the plot or reveals a small hint that sends your thoughts spiralling in different directions, trying to decipher what it means, leaving you slightly pleasantly disoriented. As you continue, the marvels escalate and the various plot lines only continue to become more intertwined and complex and you have to wonder how they will all come together as they're so fantastical. Morgenstern has created a sensory overload of smells and sounds which transcends the imaginary to make the atmosphere and ambiance of such an impossibly unrealistic circus realistic! And the best part is how it is all so effortlessly painted across the pages.<br /><br />Refreshing was the exclusion of cliffhanger chapters, to encourage you to read on. Instead, Morgenstern opted to end each chapter with a dramatic flourish that had you reflecting on not just the current chapter, but everything you had read up until that point. Her contemplative endings had you re-evaluating your ideas on how the game was to be played, what outcome you thought she would choose, and how (or if) the circus would be able to thrive.<br /><br />As example:<br /><br />  Lainie nods and lifts her glass to her lips but instead of sipping her tea, she opens her fingers, releasing her grip.<br />  The cup falls, crashing into the saucer below.<br />  The glass shatters, the sound echoing through the room. The tea spills out over the tiles.<br />  Before anyone turns at the noise, the cup has righted itself. The broken pieces re-form around the liquid and the glass sits intact, the tile surface of the table is dry.<br />  Those who glances over at their table at the noise assume it was their imagination, and return their attention to their own tea.<br />  \\"Why didn't you stop it before it broke?\\" Lainie asks.<br />  \\"I don't know,\\" Celia says.<br />  \\"If you ever need anything from me, I would like you to ask,\\" Lainie says as she stands to leave. \\"I am tired of everyone keeping their secrets so well that they get other people killed. We are all involved in your game, and it seems we are not as easily repaired as teacups.\\"<br />  Celia sits alone for some time after Lainie departs, both cups of tea growing cold.<br /><br />Stunning. I sat, as Celia did, just thinking about everything I knew about Lainie, and what it must mean for her to have reached this conclusion, and what it might mean for the entire circus - both performers and patrons.<br /><br />The seemingly forbidden romance blossoming between Celia and Marco left me breathless and anxious and excited and heartbroken all at the same time. Stolen moments, the faintest of touches, whispered kisses and a bond no amount of time or space could break - still gives me shivers.<br /><br />Beautiful, wonderful, and magically delicious; do not miss out on the opportunity to experience the circus you have previously only caught glimpses of in dreams.e opportunity to experience the circus you have previously only caught glimpses of in dreams.

0385738765|2.0|As I start The Scorch Trials, all I can think is, why do they bother? I understand that when pushed, humans have a very strong survival instinct. But I feel like these kids have been pushed beyond the farthest limits you could set, and are still expected to keep going. With no trust in WICKED, and no security in the promise of a safe haven, why bother? At one point, Thomas does mention revenge against WICKED as his motive for pushing through his impending meltdown, but I just can't see revenge being worth it at this point. I guess that wouldn't make me a very good candidate! Anyways, its these thoughts that permeate my experience of The Scorch Trials. I had a hard time getting in to the story, as I felt how tired the Gladers were, especially Thomas, and it made me tired. Their acceptance of their inability to change anything made me feel hopeless and again wonder, why bother?<br /><br />For me, Dashner is unable to distinguish between creating suspense and just being plain annoying. I admit, I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of this book, as the twists were unpredictable. The problem I now face, is that I am left with next to no resolution. I waited in anticipation for almost 400 pages to find out that I have to read the next instalment to get any answers. Yes, bits and pieces were revealed, but nothing that really added to what I already knew from The Maze Runner. This does not sit well with me. I found myself having to put down the book and walk away because I was so frustrated with the lack of answers. And so many of the various plot twists introduced seemed needless and just added to my overall frustration, like Dashner was just making things up as he went. This gave the book an almost careless and unplanned feel, like a lot of the looses ends won't be explained because they weren't given much original thought. I'm sure in the next book I will finally get some type of resolution, but I feel like there should have been something given in this to make me WANT to pursue the next instalment. Instead, if I want to know anything, I HAVE to read The Death Cure. Seems like a pretty dirty and sneaky way to make sure I don't stop halfway through the trilogy.<br /><br />My next problem is that throughout the entire book, there is no sense of time passing...like, at all. When I got near the end, and the Gladers announced they had only 3 days to get to the safe haven, I was genuinely shocked. It was the first indication that any significant amount of time had passed (that I noticed) and the fact that almost two weeks had passed really surprised me. Part of me wondered how it took them so long to get to their destination, then I remembered they were supposed to be covering 100 miles. All the times they spent running kind of blurred together, and I kept catching myself wondering how long the Gladers had spent running, and how it was physically possible for them to run for such long periods of time. I probably missed sections of the plot contemplating how a person could run that often, on such little amounts of food/water in a desert-like landscape.<br /><br />Finally, continuing from The Maze Runner, I don't really care for any of the characters. I was glad to see Minho took more of a main role, but I still can't relate to Thomas (who has next to no personality, considering he spends half of the book sleeping or knocked out), I can't stand Teresa (she's all over the place!) and the other more minor characters all kind of blend together - we don't even know all of the Gladers' names, even though by the end, there's only 11 of them. I did like the introduction of Brenda, even though she freaked me out a couple times, but I didn't care for the love-triangle (kind of) thing that was happening between her, Thomas and Teresa.<br /><br />Overall I feel pretty meh about this, and will only read The Death Cure to find out why they were put through all of this in the first place.me WANT to pursue the next instalment.

I did like the introduction of Brenda, even though she freaked me out a couple times, but I didn't care for the love-triangle (kind of) thing that was happening between her, Thomas and Teresa.<br /><br />Overall I feel pretty meh about this, and will only read The Death Cure to find out why they were put through all of this in the first place.

B0073PZIYI|4.0|Excellent entertaining commentary on plutocracy and wealth distribution disguised as a sci fi action flick. Timberlake is still working on his acting, but it didn't detract from the movie.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|fun memories... late 80s or early 90's. era space shooter... not bad for free app of the day...  not going to give it 5 stars, but rather 3 for nostalgia's sake... if it were like 1986 or so though it would be higher
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|John Steinbeck's classic novel, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" is about the Joad family who migrate from Oklahoma to California for a search of a better life and promises of work and living. They have survived the Dust Bowl in the Plains and are going to lose their homestead like thousands of families. John Steinbeck did a masterful job in writing about a family's experience. The John Ford film adaptation is brilliant and Henry Fonda should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Jane Darwell's performance of Ma Joad earned her an Academy Award for Supporting Actress in a Film. The film is shot in black and white and restored.<br /><br />The film is a brilliant American film classic that should be on everybody's list of greatest film movies about the American experience. The DVD also has two scholars about John Steinbeck and John Ford in the commentary section of the film. If you want to watch the film first, I would recommend that. I saw the commentary version as part of a paper assignment which was mostly talking over the entire film. The extras included Jane Darwell's Oscar acceptance speech where it wasn't an actual Oscar but an Academy Award. The other extras included movie tone footage of the Dust Bowl.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is a brilliant film and this DVD is worth the cost if you are interested in the Dust Bowl, the migration of thousands of families to the West in search of a better life in California. The story is filled with twists and turns as well as brilliant acting and writing. It's a film that I haven't seen in all these years. It's brilliant and I wished that I had seen it sooner.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The second installment in the series does not disappoint. While one could always nit pick at something or other, I find that it is rare for me to find an entirely new series that has me doing nothing but reading, from cover to cover. It's a rare privilege, and just for that I think five stars are owed! I will therefore refrain from providing an in-depth critique that reveals half the plot, and let other potential readers enjoy discovering Kvothe's world all by themselves!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun. I like how you can play different mini games within  this one app. I just wish u didn't have to use your points to play the other games. overall pretty good.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I honestly can't remember the last time I bought a CD for myself. Usually, I'm happier just buying MP3 singles as I hear and like them. But as soon as I heard this one (you can stream it on their website) I not only ordered it, but their first album, Aim and Ignite as well.<br /><br />There is a lot of talent on this album. Nate Ruess has a great voice, which is a pleasure to listen to, and most of the songs have wonderful, deep instrumentation and harmonies as well.<br /><br />The only downside to this CD were the two songs that contained copious digital voice modification. Some people are calling it \\"autotune\\" and I've also heard it referred to as a \\"vocoder.\\" Whatever it is, it sounds like someone got really excited about the T-Pain microphone he got for Christmas. It's awful (and totally unnecessary). I can't even listen to those two songs, but the other nine make buying the whole CD totally worthwhile!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is an easy, fun game. I really enjoy all of the choices you get to play. I give it 5 stars.

B006JTS5OO|2.0|I really like the Muppets. Not only during my childhood but as an adult. Jim Henson's Muppets are very unremarkable puppets, but through his genius he gave them dynamic personalities that contrasted their bland exteriors. If you watch some of the original movies like The Muppet Movie, Muppets Take Manhattan, and Muppets in space you'll notice a subtle brilliance. The Muppets work not only as entertainment, but also as satire of entertainment in general. Specifically as a commentary of what it is really like to work in Hollywood. About the failures, the obstacles and the individuals who just haven't made it yet.<br /><br />This movie has none of this. None of the spirit, the heart and the warmth.<br /><br />When I heard Segal (and Adams) were involved, I was excited. Segal shows a lot of fandom towards the Muppets, but being a fan isn't enough. Much of what pours through in the writing seems like Segal's own private fantasy. Like some wild adventure he would've liked to have had with the Muppets that really has nothing to do with the Muppets. The movie never seems to be about the Muppets, but rather seems like it's about Segal, Adams and his Muppet brother. The three least interesting additions.<br /><br />These problems show up in the musical numbers, which usually drag on far to long, are bland and uninspired, and feature whole chorus lines of dancing humans. Dancing humans? The original Muppet movies typically got by with incidental human interactions. The musical numbers were almost always Muppet driven. Not these. They look like something more appropriate for Hairspray.<br /><br />This is confusing for me. When I started the movie I was offended by the glaring lack of focus on The Muppets. Where is the whirlwind romance between Piggy and Kermit? Where is the Rizzo side story? Where is the hilarious stand up of Fozzy Bear, or for that matter, where is the not-so-hilarious stand up of Fozzy Bear? The Electric Mayhem? I remember laughing in previous Muppet installments, now I sit anxiously waiting for musical numbers to wrap it up.<br /><br />The story is cliche' at best, which isn't even a problem, but becomes one since the movie lacks any heart. The Muppets were never particularly plot driven anyways, but the characters are important, and with their noticeable absence from the plot it's forced to rely on it's weak plot and forced cameos. Cameos used to be reserved, by the by, for real talents who added to the movie's Variety Show feel, but now their just Tween icons who awkwardly try to fit in where they don't belong.<br /><br />This movie, at best, is a passable musical. Sadly The Muppets are a VARIETY show, and it's that variety displayed through unique personalities who all represents various aspects of \\"the business\\" that made the Muppets so special. Also this movie removed the edge and grit that brought the Muppets so close to home. The overly polished atmosphere of this film gets away from the Indie atmosphere that was always present during the Henson era. The Muppets always felt like a charming low budget variety troupe' on the verge of making it, and when you have a back up crew of 40 dancers you lose that. When you lose that, you really lose the novelty of it all.<br /><br />If there is any consolation in the two star review it's that I believe Segal did his best. I think the nostalgia element is there, and certainly I appreciate that he is a fan, and not some Hollywood Exec just trying to make a buck (how ironic). I think he unwittingly proved that without Henson, or a much stronger understanding of Henson, that any attempt to revive this franchise is probably not worth it. My suspicion always has been that without Henson this franchise is dead, and from the looks of it, it is. He still left us many wonderful hours of the old Muppets on DVD. If I were anyone I would rewatch some old Muppets if they wish to relive the glory. Skip this little number, it ain't worth it.
B005SV9X22|5.0|Pre-Ordered this for my dad as a gift and he Loves it, even brings it to my house so I can watch some of her performances, and I even enjoyed it. I would recommend this video to anyone that is a Lady Gaga fan like my dad is! Arrived Quickly!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Before this movie came out I would definitely have labeled myself a Trekkie. I loved having debates with my friends over TNG VS TOS and I was always re-watching old episodes of both. When this movie came out I was... skeptical. The whole time watching the movie I was in the theater shouting in the privacy of my head, NO! You can't do that! WTF?! Then we meet Leonard Nimoy's character, and suddenly I was okay with everything the movie was doing. If you're watching the movie because you love the original series, you're going to be pissed, but if you watch the movie and judge it based on the movie alone, you'll be quite pleased.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Faot  played for several hours after I got it.  Very entertaining and cute story.  Great graphics and works great on Evo 4g.  Would buy for sure.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is hands down one of the most compelling stories I have read in a long time, and I have been reading sci-fi since I was 10 and found \\"I, Robot\\" on my fathers bookshelf.  I want to start a book club just so I can make all my friends read this!  I will be there for any and all future installments, and you should be too!<br /><br />I wish I could begin to articulate the awesomeness that is this series, but my lack of words is why I'm a big reader and not much of a writer!  As a person who reads a lot, I can say this is worth your time and your money if you have any interest in good story telling, whether you are a \\"sci-fi\\" person or not.  It's just a darn good story from beginning to where it has currently left off - because I sure hope there is more some day.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Won't review the video and audio quality, as that has been covered extensively elsewhere.  It's good this region-free and slim package contains _almost_ all bonus content released for the various Matrix movies.  Compared to the various DVD versions however, the following is what you will NOT find here.  Or at the very least, _I_ could not find:<br /><br />*  From \\"The Matrix\\" Region2 UK Limited Edition 3disk version, disk3 \\"Enter The Matrix\\": TV ad Europe + Trailer + Making of + Cheats Codes.<br />*  From \\"The Matrix Revisited\\": \\"The True Followers: Interviews With Hardcore Fans\\" + \\"Chase In The Alley: Scene study with behind-the-scenes\\".<br />*  From \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\": Animatrix trailer.<br />*  From \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" DVD-ROM content: Tunnel Recon Flash Game + The Matrix Comics preview + TheMatrix.com Preview Player + The Matrix Online Game + DVD Events.<br />*  From \\"Ultimate Matrix Collection\\" Region2 Scandinavia (released by Sandrew Metronome) version, disk7 \\"The Animatrix\\": \\"Enter The Matrix: In The Making\\" (2:52).<br />*  From \\"Ultimate Matrix Collection\\" disk 10 DVD-ROM features:<br />*-  \\"Bonus Audio Commentary by Actor Keanu Reeves, Actress Carrie-Anne Moss and Various other Members of the Cast and Crew\\".<br />*-  \\"The Matrix Online Game\\" (Warner Bros.

Information on the missing disk10 content is quite helpfully reported atthe bottom of \\"dvdmg. com / matrixse.shtml\\" .<br /><br />The missing specs/contents were compared to what is advised at dvdcompare.net (when searching for \\"matrix\\".  Also have not been able to find any of these \\"bonuses\\" as easter eggs on this bluray collection either.  Hope this helps.
076115678X|5.0|I came across this book while considering a very short hair cut because I was sick of the time and effort it took to wear my wavy/curly hair straight. At first some of the suggestions seemed crazy, no shampoo? no brushing or combing? But I decided to give it a try and if it didn't work, I'd continue with my plan for a new short style. I found a DevaCurl stylist and she gave me a curly girl hair trim, showed me how to style my curls, got the products that do not contain all the harsh and damaging chemicals (silicone, alcohol, etc)and began the process. This is week three and my hair is looking and feeling great. My curls have become more defined and bouncy and I don't spend an hour every morning with a blow dryer and flat iron. I don't panic when it's raining, which used to make my hair turn frizzy. Now it just perks up my curls. If you have curly or wavy hair and you're struggling with how to live with it, you need to read this book.

B004ETVAH0|5.0|JEFF BECK-ROCK & ROLL PARTY HONORING LES PAUL: When six string guru JEFF BECK decided to throw a ROCK & ROLL PARTY in honor of his mentor LES PAUL, creator of the solid body electric guitar and recording innovations like multi-tracking, he certainly didn't skimp on the entertainment; the tight as a drum-head backing band for this rockabilly boogie woogie wing-ding is straight out of an ELVIS PRESLEY flick, led by pompadoured cool-daddy singer/guitarist DARRELL HINGHAM. BECK also shares the stage with HINGHAM's wife IMELDA MAY, a stunningly sultry sex kitten who coos, caresses, yips and yells like a possessed retro-chic soul-mama, truly a shimmy-shakin' talent to marvel at. BECK and MAY lovingly channel LES PAUL & MARY FORD's pioneering fretwork and echo-saturated vocals to recreate early fifties classics VAYA CON DIOS, MOCKINGBIRD HILL, and HOW HIGH THE MOON, retaining the high-spirited zing and novel beauty of the originals. The man with an axe to grind also takes on jump bluser TINY BRADSHAW's swingin' chestnut TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN', (which BECK's old band THE YARDBIRDS memorably covered), plus steam-heat instrumentals PETER GUNN, APACHE, and SLEEP WALK with neck-breakin' chops and passion to spare. Sixties soul slinger GARY \\"U.S.\\" BONDS shows up for the crowd-participation pleaser NEW ORLEANS, followed by twanger revivalist BRIAN SETZER, who busts out EDDIE COCHRAN's TWENTY FLIGHT ROCK to cap off this funky, fast-paced tribute. Surely LES PAUL was smiling down from his heavenly throne this very special evening.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE SOLOS

B0062P332Y|5.0|This is a very good action flick set in the early 80's.  The sets are well done and the period costume design is close enough to make me nostalgic.  Of course, this is a 2011 film done using modern equipment that makes actual 80's film quality pale significantly by comparison.<br /><br />As a period piece set in the early 80's this Killer Elite (no relation to the 70's film with the same name) is a winner.  This is a fun film with a good amount of action and even some SAS action.<br /><br />For some real SAS action from the early 80's one cannot do better than the 1982 film Who Dares Wins  -aka-  The Final Option.  [[ASIN:B0065IZJ1G Who Dares Wins (1982) ( The Final Option ) [ Blu-Ray, Reg.A/B/C Import - Australia ]]]<br /><br />Who Dares Wins features many actual SAS chaps and featured a great many scenes shot in actual SAS training facilities.  Fun stuff.<br /><br />To my mind, 2011's Killer Elite and 1982's Who Dares Wins make a great double feature.<br /><br />An important point: Blu Ray does not have the same regional encoding as DVD's.<br /><br />Cheers,

B003747252|4.0|The last fiction book I read was probably the hardyboys and that was in the century when tyrannosaurus was walking the earth. Since then fiction book has never been one of my favourite genre until I came across the Flashforward TV series, which then persuaded me to try the novel. I must admit the first few chapters captured my attention and transported me to the Switzerland, experiencing the busy schedule of physicists as if I was really there: the smell, the food, the character, the emotions all became so vivid.<br />Call me a spoiler but I can't stop but talk about this one, it'll be worth your every minute spent reading. It started to what seemed like a thoroughly planned experiment in a top laboratory and developed into a world chaos... The world went to sleep for few minutes with everyone having a glimpsed of the future. Of course not everyone got the \\"and they live happily ever after\\" vision, nonetheless all had to put on a good fight to either prevent or bring to past their vision. Government, economic, scholars, relationship, politics, heath, finance all put to test, with only the strong to survive. But the question stays; can we really prevent the future if we know how the story ends?<br /><br />The book is well articulated, full of action with suspense from cover to cover. For those who are yet to read the flashforward; Robert Sawyer will capture your imagination forwarding you to the word of detective, science, academic and relationship like you could never imagine. For others like me: this book really deserves our praise.

0441013597|5.0|I've never given sci-fi books a fair chance, but I've read & enjoyed a number of fantasy books such as Feist, Gemmell, Rothfuss etc. This book is not that far removed from that genre. It does take about 20 pages to get your head around this world, the characters, their role & how they fit into the storyline but it won't take too long for it to all fall into place. I've already started on the follow up Dune Messiah which should give you clear indication that I really enjoyed this book.

Now, Monopoly has always been a fun game, even when I was growing up as a kid. But to play as my favorite Nintendo characters is great. I think this game is Educational about the real world! It teaches how to count out the money to pay for property or rent. Great buy ! I think every family should have at least one monopoly game in their homes.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|Drive is a unique film which I'm not surprised alienates some viewers, specifically due to it's slow Hitchcock-esque build up and lack of traditional movie dialogue. Hence why I love this movie. That and the remarkable beauty in every frame.<br /><br />I think before anything is said of the director, the script and the acting something must be said for Ryan Gosling. Ryan delivered one of the single best acting jobs I have ever seen. The way he uses his eyes and face to subtly convey that inner drive beneath his bland exterior is nothing short of amazing. You know he's crazy, you're just waiting for the suspicion to be confirmed and when it is the result is mind blowing. It's one of those performances that shows just how different Ryan Gosling can be, and just how much range he will have as an actor.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is added by a very sharp and derivative script. The script does away with most dialogue, and cuts everything down to basically what is necessary. In a way it very much resembles real life. When movie characters open their mouths you expect very over the top things to come out, bits of dialogue that would otherwise be awkward if uttered in real life. In this movie, it uses the awkwardness of very real life exchanges to create tension you can cut with a knife.<br /><br />The script itself is not very deep though. I struggle to figure exactly what the moral is, but honestly I never thought the movie needed one. It finds other ways to stick with you long after you've finished it.<br /><br />I think some people are accustomed to movies being a certain way, and this movie certainly dares to be different. For me, there is no movie quite like it. I think everyone should see it.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|ok now I love this game but my high score is 138 fruits and my moms is 450 I have been trying to beat her but I can not. I love this game you have to have skill too. also great for the kindle fire
B002AF4Y9G|4.0|This is one of those movies that, in all honesty, I should've liked a lot more. First it confirms everyone's suspicions: Woody Harrelson is an outstanding actor. Second: it dares to be different, and has a bold and unique message. Third: It's got a stellar cast featuring Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Seizmore and Rodney Dangerfield to name a few.<br /><br />Often times though when you give the audience everything they want they're not left wanting more, and if you give them too much, some has to be sent back. This is the case with Natural Born Killers. The movie spreads itself a little thin, and even drags in a lot of places it could've used more effectively. Perhaps they could've even added *gasp* more violence.<br /><br />One thing I wish Oliver Stone and Tarantino would've done is make this a trilogy which each Act getting it's own feature length film. Compacting all they had into one film absolutely killed any and all character development. For example when RDJ calls his wife and girlfriend from prison the whole scene comes out of nowhere, and just ends up being throwaway nonsense. Robert Downey Jr. and Tommy Lee Jones present two of the films most interesting characters with zero emotional impact on the film. The Warden could've never spoken and the entire movie wouldn't have changed one iota. I also didn't care for the quick turn arounds most of these characters had. Even the two main characters, as fun as they were, were not developed to the extent they could've been.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones could've been as memorable as Nurse Ratchet, but we never actually see him be the 'big bad Warden', he just talks about it incidentally in the hall. I personally would've loved to see a whole film about Harrelson and Lewis' time in prison. Dealing with Tommy Lee Jones, taking crap from him until finally taking over the prison.<br /><br />Rodney Dangerfield has similar treatment. The whole sitcom satire at the beginning is outstanding, but it comes off like anSNL skit in the middle of a movie. Over before it starts.<br /><br />The is just overcooked, so much greatness and so little time.

B00005LDE1|1.0|I have wanted Benny and Joon since I saw it four months ago. I guess aiming cheap was not the best of ideas. Not only did the DVD not play on my gaming consoles it did not play on my laptop or DVD player. You'd think the one thing out of all the items whose sole purpose was to play DVDs would play it... no... it was so far from the truth. You can only imagine my shear disappointment and heart break when none of the devices about would play Benny and Joon.

B0071MQ37E|5.0|VERY few movies for Broadway productions leave me satisfied.  This is one of the very few exceptions.  My only wish is that the camera angles were more constant as to show more of the stage throughout the performance.  This aside, I've seen Phantom of the Opera on Broadway a minimum of ten times while living in NYC and can honestly say that I enjoyed watching this more than being at a live performance.  For the first time, I could see and not just hear all of the actors, and being able to see up-close the actor's expressions added to my ability to fully understand the events of the show which I'd not been able to pick up while seeing the show on Broadway.  I so hope that shows like Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, City of Angels, Sunset Boulevard, and others will follow suit.  Bravo to all involved in creating this masterpiece!!!!

B004EPYZTE|2.0|This is a horrible way to re-spark the Conan saga. I thought that Jason Momoa was great in his role as Khal Drogo in \\"The Game of Thrones\\" and that would have been a great way portray Conan, but I'm afraid this Conan movie is a little too soft. Like most movie re-makes, the story was a bit weak. I think that if the writers had stayed true to the Conan graphic novels/comics, it could have had brutal potential. The acting left much to be desired and the fight scenes were so complex, they seemed staged. Brutality folks! That's all a Conan movie needs. Better luck next time.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I can see how, if you didn't grow up in the 80s, this book would be lost on you. I found Cline's amalgam of genres to be refreshing. It's not quite sci-fi, not quite a romance, not quite fiction...it's all of the above. I particularly enjoyed the Rush references. Good stuff. Not like any book I've ever read.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I was super excited that my family's newly purchased 2009 Subaru Forester had iPod integration with a cable coming out of the center console, but then subsequently bummed when it didn't charge my iPhone 3GS or my wife's iPhone 4. I figured it was a software problem, and we'd just have to settle for a non-charging connection. After ridiculous hours of research I stumbled upon this adapter and questioningly paid $23. I am happy to report this adapter successfully charges my family's iPhones in my 2009 Subaru Forester with the OEM iPod kit! I hope this doesn't sound verbose and repetitive, but I'm hoping this review will save someone hours of internet research. I cannot comment on the usefulness of the adapter with 30-pin docks and stereos for iOS devices with cases, but it should be the first thing you buy if your new used car has an old iPod kit from back in the day.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I am a very tough critic on contemporary novels. There are few I like, and almost none I really love. But The Night Circus was wonderful. I think most of that feeling can be contributed to the book's enigmatic tone and vivid imagery. Although the plot is layered, and hard to sum up in just a few sentences, it didn't feel overly complicated. Two magicians in the late 19th-century make a bet pitting their students against each other at a game of skill and stamina. The venue/cover for the game turns out to be a circus. But this is no ordinary circus. The students' destinies--and the destinies of the circus performers and their audience--become tied to the existence of Le Cirque des Reves, and to the competition that fuels it. The novel is not perfect, it jumps around in time quite a lot, but the time-jumping was a necessary plot device for dramatic build-up and  didn't feel annoyingly contrived to me. In fact, I wish Neil Gaiman would take note. I always feel his books are so linear and often one-noted that there's little build-up or pay-off. Overall, I thought The Night Circus was a really lovely novel. I hope the film (if it gets made) will do the tone and imagery of the book justice.

0385534639|5.0|Every so often, a novel comes along that knocks me off my feet, ties me up and leaves me bound, unable to escape until I turn its final page. Even after that final page is turned though, these novels live in my memory, constanly ekeing their way into my thoughts and colouring my discussion of other, inferior novels. I've been lucky enough to have this experience twice in the last handful of months; first with [[ASIN:0385343841 The Tiger's Wife: A Novel]] by T&eacute;a Obreht and now with The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern.<br /><br />The Night Circus centres around a duel between two young, promising magicians, Celia Bown and Marco Alasdair, thrust unbeknownst into competition against each other at a young age by their competing mentors. The most obvious comparison is to Christopher Priest's The Prestige, a classic novel about a staged duel between two competing stage magicians. But this is only a surface level examination of the plot of The Night Circus. The duel itself is not really Celia and Marco's story, but rather a it's the tale of their respective mentors, who hover on the outskirts of every important event in the novel, manipulating everything from the shadows. The Night Circus is a story about community, and about the stories that create a community. It is the story of the people behind the circus' creation, a labour of love and magic that defines their lives for the 30-or-so years that the novel spans; it is the story of the circus-performers themselves, in particular the young twins, Widget and Poppet, born on the night when the circus first opens; it is the story of the rêveurs, a loose group of passtionate circus-goers, ensnared by the mysticism and perfection of the circus, using it as a way to escape from life, to reaffirm themselves of the good in the world; but central to it all, the twin forces that hold these lives in thrall and on track, are Marco and Celia -- their's is a story of love and passion, discovery and the boundaries of imagination. On the surface, there are many similarities to Priest's novel, but where The Prestige is about power and corruption, greed and seduction, The Night Circus is a tale of perseverance and free-will, of the good in life and the magic in us all.<br /><br />Like the young narrator, Morgenstern seems less to be telling the story than revealing it, pulling back the layers piece-by-piece to immerse the reader in the lives of the myriad characters who help form Celia and Marco's story. This effect is bouyed by wonderful prose from Morgenstern, so rich and evocative that it's easy to lose yourself amongst the tents of Le Cirque des Rêves, as enraptured by wonder as the circus-goers in the novel. At one point, the narrator says of the proprietor of Le Cirque des Rêves, \\"Chandresh has an inherent flair for the unusual and curious; he understands the power of atmosphere. (p. 57)\\" I was struck by this quote and how appropriate it is for Morgenstern herself. The ability of her prose to transport the reader to this other place is profound and most evident in the several vignettes scattered throughout the novel. Unlike the rest of the novel, they are told from a second-person perspective and serve no other purpose than to set the stage, to push the reader into Le Cirque des Rêves and convince them to remember back to their childhood, when magic still existed.<br /><br />The Night Circus is a classic novel that will sit on the highest shelf of my bookshelf, right next to The Hobbit and The Shadow of the Wind. If you're familiar with me or this blog, you will know that that is not praise lightly given. It calls back to a time when there was still magic in the circus, when slack-jawed carnies, enormous teddy bears and rigged ring-toss was nothing but a far-off thought. The majority of my time spent reading The Night Circus was in the early morning, before the sun rose, and at bedtime, while the moon hung in the sky and darkness blanketed the world. During the daylight hours, when Iwas not reading The Night Circus, I thought of little else, and I think Chandresh Christophe Lef&egrave;vre, proprietor of Le Cirque des Rêves, would be proud. There's magic in this novel and it deserves to be read by anyone wanting to be reminded that there is more to life than meets the eye.ot reading The Night Circus, I thought of little else, and I think Chandresh Christophe Lefèvre, proprietor of Le Cirque des Rêves, would be proud.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Have had this on my iPhone 4s for about 2-3 months now and it has worked great.  Even though it's faily soft and squishy, it has held up well.  It's not too hard to put on and take off, but I wouldn't want to do that a lot.  It's not too big or bulky and it doesn't ditract from the appearance of the phone.  I dropped the phone once onto a hard tile floor with this on and the phone came through without a scratch.  I have reccommended this to friends.
0385535139|5.0|I've read them all, some with great enthusiasm and some with disappointment, and I believe that this could be the best of the lot. The perfect mix of serious and fun with characters you can really get behind. Grisham manages to tell a story about the bottom-feeders of law practice (divorces , DUIs and advertising on bus stop benches) while bringing the lightheartedness of some of his best novels. The string of bad luck is reminiscent of Carl Hiaasen and left me laughing at several points. Very enjoyable, very satisfying and I could not put it down.

006197806X|5.0|Lena has come a long way from the girl she was at the beginning of the series. In Pandemonium, we see her inner strength begin to shine. Lena has lost a lot and at first she is ready to give up but then she reminds herself of what she has sacrificed for freedom and she finds the will to go on. The people who live in the Wilds have a life of deprivation and hardship. Food and medicine are scarce and they have to be constantly vigilant for signs of danger. Still, they find a way to thrive. Their leader, Raven, is a tough young woman who is at times admirable for her strength and at other times she behaves in deplorable ways. She reminded me of some of the people in Mockingjay. There were several times that Pandemonium brought that book to mind as we find out more about the Resistance movement. I was also reminded of Crossed by Ally Condie because of Lena's time in the Wilds and Cassia's struggles in the Outer Provinces.<br /><br />Some people may not like Pandemonium because of the cliffhanger ending. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed though not surprised by it as things like that often happen in trilogies. Still, I think Lauren Oliver is an excellent writer and I enjoyed most of the book. I am hopeful that I will love book three even though I was slightly disappointed with Pandemonium in the end. There are enough surprises and plot twists to entertain, there is good character development for Lena, and even some romance. I liked the introduction of new characters and look forward to seeing where the story will take them. Overall I thought Pandemonium was a worthy sequel to Delirium and I can't wait to find out what happens in Requiem.<br /><br />Readalikes: Crossed by Ally Condie, The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, Wither by Lauren DeStefano

B006OB3K56|3.0|The main character's behavior wasn't that different than most single men in their 30s....  The only abusive behavior would be the surfing porn while at work... I think his sister's character had more issues and problems than he did..  I expected him involved in abusive S&M or some type of abusive/unhealthy fetish. I don't expect people to agree with me, I just expected the film to be more severe in regards to his so called addiction.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|This was a fun movie and I often find myself watching it just to immerse myself in the world they created.  It's a fun look at a writer that longs for days gone by and then gets to experience them.  It's also a look at how we romanticize the past, instead of sometimes living in & appreciating the present.  The scenes and the music make this a very fun movie to watch, and Owen Wilson did a great job as a Woody Allen-type character.  I'd recommend it if  you're looking for a fun and delightful film!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Recently purchased the Ultimate Edition 4 DVD set of Dawn of the Dead and I will say this is absolutly a must own for any fan of this film. The US, International and extended editions are all here plus loaded with extras included commentaries on each version of the film and the great Frumkes Document Of The dead. I have heard Anchor Bay has discontinued many of the classic horror dvds. If you are a big fan of the film I highly recommend you buy this now before the prices get outrageous.

B001HBYHFA|1.0|But this was awful. For those who don't know, Firefly failed miserably because it was aired out of order by Fox, moving the airing days and times around, so it never built an audience. Serenity is the movie to \\"wrap up\\" what was started in Firefly.<br />It's awful. Firefly was Joss Whedon's dream project, and it was cancelled. Joss Whedon, apparently, threw in the towel and made a movie expressing his crushed dreams instead of a two hour Firefly finale. The characters are changed, (Simon goes undercover...? since when?) to the point of contradicting the TV show, and Joss expresses his emoness over his show being cancelled by killing off two of the main cast. The Reaver plot is decent, and probably would have come out in a Firefly episode, but the rest is awful. Look it up on wikipedia if you want an explanation of Reavers, and spare yourself the pain of watching this movie.<br />I personally view this as a very well done fan fiction, so it doesn't taint the amazingness that is Firefly.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I'll start by saying that I have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books by Charlain Harris and LOVED them. I literally couldn't read them fast enough! There is such a balance  of action, comedy, tradgedy, suspense and the characters are really well developed throughout the series and the plot was delightfully free of holes. As I was finishing the last couple of books I couldn't WAIT to get my hands on True Blood so I could see the story come to life on the screen.<br /><br />*Sigh* I was SO disappointed! I knew going into it that any HBO show is going to have more sex, violence and \\"strong language\\" than any other network but this show just goes WAY beyond the pale. There are so many sex scenes it detracts from the story and makes me feel like I'm watching some kind of porn. I also knew to expect that there would be differences in translating from book to screen but the writers at HBO have made ALL of the side characters into main characters (and not compelling ones either)and there are so many newly invented story lines that it makes my head spin! The side stories are just distracting from the main story which is actually full of action and heart.<br /><br />Bottom line, HBO charges at least twice as much for a season on DVD (12 episodes for $40?!)as pretty much anyone else and I spent most of my time fast-forwarding through the boring side plots and useless sex scenes and sighing as they changed the characters actions from the original story line (making them DUMBER and creating HUGE plot holes)I only finished the season because I had spent so much and couldn't return it (and hoped against hope that it would get better)and I will not be buying future seasons. I'd be better off just re-reading the books! (10 books for $80 is a way better deal anyway!)
B0059XTUMC|5.0|5 Out of 5 Stars<br /><br />They just don't make them like they used to ... no really.<br /><br />The Artist is a film set in classic 1920's Hollywood, the silent era.  A movie that stands out from others as a unique and different tale of cinema.  It takes a chance, and as almost all of critics everywhere agree, it gambles and wins!  The Weinsteins chose wisely when they chose Michel Hazanavicius' masterpiece!<br /><br />The Artist takes place during the slient era and our hero, Geroge Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the top movie star of the period.  He runs into a girl Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who's trying to break into the industry and become an acttress herself.<br /><br />As time passes, The Great Depression hits, and talking pictures are born.  The world gradually moves away from the silent era and its stars and want to see a new face, Peppy Miller.  So the tides turn and the new face of Hollywood is now Peppy Miller.  We see over the course of time how the relationship between the two matriculates as they both fight for their careers and fall in love in the process!<br /><br />We see the talents of James Cromwell, as Clifton, the hired help of George Valentine.  Malcolm McDowell, the extra/bit player.  As well as the amazing job of veteran John Goodman, Al Zimmer, the classic, stereotypical movie studio executive of the era as he and George Valentin quest for greatness and success in the world of movies!  A brilliantly put together cast!<br /><br />This is a silent picture, as if it were spit out directly from 1927 itself, and it fits right in in it's own new 2011 way!  So with this being a silent film, the music of the picture has to carry your film as it's one of the MAIN characters of the story and The Artist never fails to deliver in this category!  So composer, Ludovic Bource, who passed up a lot of big budget, important work to score this film made a wise career move, as movies like this just don't come around that often.  A movie that can stand the test of time and can easily be called one of the best of the decade!  Utilizing the talents of the greatest composer of all time in my opinion, Bernard Herrmann, GENIUS!!  I was in tears when I heard his famous music from the greatest score ever composed used in The Artist! That scene alone speaks volumes more than most movies that come around!<br /><br />The art of cinema just took a giant leap forward in the battle of quantity vs. quality.  Money just doesn't matter when you see such quality of filmmaking at its finest!<br /><br />The Artist ... the BEST movie ... of the year!

146999769X|5.0|Siddhartha is a character that portrays the initiate in his early stages of development, immersed in life, yet desiring the ultimate knowledge. The tale brings to life the humanity of his quest. It will appeal to  the 'seeker' and help him or she become more compassionate with themselves as they realise the tale of Siddhartha is in fact the tale of every human that begins the journey toward understanding. A very good read. .
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The three books in this series were excellent all in all. However the first was by far the best. Then it sort of went downhill from there.

B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Released a year before Star Wars, in some ways Logan's Run looks more dated. It was a low budget production with a small cast some stiff acting. But its whole objective was different. Whereas Star Wars took from classical literature, Greek tradgedy, Shakespearean power struggles and swash-buckling priate movies (just set in space), Logans run was heavily based on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. A vision of a future where people had a different basis to their way of life rather than thinking and reacting as a 20th centriury person would. With the population born in incubators and free love on the basis of \\"everybody belongs to everybody else\\", this is a challenging movie. A \\"what if\\" movie. Not the best acting, or script, or special effects, but it was an important stepping stone to later sci-fi developments. Recommended to anyone more interested in the future of social enginerering than those just looking for a Errol Flynn in space.
B0043GAZYS|3.0|I wasn't aware of this graphic novel or comic book, whatever it is, but I thought the trailers and premise had some promise.  Granted the plot is pretty juvenile and the acting isn't very good but I actually had a pretty good time.  I would have like to have seen a bit more writing punch especially the jokes and the 7 ex's was maybe 2 or 3 too many; but it was something different and fun.  Having said that, I wonder if Michael Cera will ever allow himself to be a different character.

B005TBQS0Q|4.0|Robin Williams won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Adrian Cronauer, a real life airman who spent a brief tour in Saigon as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Network.  Hoping to boost morale for an ever escalating war, military brass brought in Cronauer in 1965 to do 2 radio shows daily.  Known for his wit and innovative style, Cronauer was also a bit unusual and irreverent  as depicted in the film.<br /><br />Williams shows both sides of his acting ability.  He is at the top of his game when he is on the air or in front of the men.  His fast paced monologues are filled with bawdy humor, insults and celebrity mimicking followed by rock and roll music.  This upsets his superiors, specifically Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh) who want a monotone delivery of censored world news followed by music by the likes of Lawrence Welk or Percy Faith, the princes of elevator music.<br /><br />Cronauer is eventually suspended when he reads an unauthorized news bulletin involving a terrorist attack on a bar where he was moments before and that American servicemen frequented.  Williams shows his dramatic skills as well when he pursues a young Vietnamese woman who resists his charms.  He becomes friends with her brother when he volunteers to teach an English class to the locals.  Instead of \\"see Jane run\\" style of learning Cronauer teaches them American slang and expletives.  It's hilarious and nearly as funny as when he's ranting on the air.  When Cronauer opens his show with a loud drawn out, gooood morning, vietnaaaam we know it's time to buckle up and enjoy the show.  This is Robin Williams at his best.<br /><br />Neither the 1.85:1 Blu ray picture or the DTS HD Master Audio sound will likely put this movie on anyones demo list, but there is nothing objectionable either.  The video is clear and crisp.  The audio is limited by the audio designs of the era, so don't expect much wow from the surrounds or sub.<br />Special features include a production diary (35 min.), some raw footage of Robin William on a roll, and trailers, all in standard def.res include a production diary (35 min.), some raw footage of Robin William on a roll, and trailers, all in standard def.

0307588343|2.0|The 80/20 rule definitely applies here: only 20% of the words were really needed to convey the story.<br /><br />This book had potential, but between the self-serving \\"look at me!\\" moments (plenty of those) and the sheer vastness of the metaphors (there are war metaphors, golf metaphors, skiing metaphors, monarchy metaphors, and more ... ad nauseum), the story gets a bit lost. Not sure if Mr. McDonald or Mr. Robinson deserve the blame or need to be sent back to writing school (if you read \\"Lone Survivor\\" you know what I'm talking about).<br /><br />If you're interested in one man's point of view of the Lehman Brothers disaster and can get past the \\"look at me!\\" moments, the endless acronyms, and one metaphor after another then you may find this book informative. Borrow from a friend or the library, but there are better ways to spend your money.

First, it's difficult to access, and secondly, it isn't something you can access on your own computer and add to other devices.<br /><br />Any time a movie like this appears with that option, I buy it via I-Tunes, and hopefully others will follow. I will never fall for a purchase of it again, not ever.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|This novel centers around a girl named Sophia who has some type of supernatural condition that causes a constant whispering sound to fill her head. Sometimes it is overpowering enough that she can't hear her own thoughts. Add this to the fact that the town's group of crazy Christian's is harassing her and the fact that she is struggling to make ends meet and I'd say she has a rather stressful life. After finally deciding she has had enough, she casts a wiccan spell to try to remove the whispering and it only makes it worse. Then her friend Ivory drags her to a club where she meets a strange, very attractive man (named Charles) and then gets chased through woods and attacked (though not by said hot guy). She passes out during the attack and when she awakes, she is thrusted into a world where vampires, shifters, and all manner of supernatural beings exist.<br /><br />Speaking of the supernatural beings, I loved the lore behind them. I loved the fact that she doesn't use the term vampire or shifter or were-animal, instead being more creative and creating new terms for them. I won't try to explain them because I know I'll just mess it up, but I really enjoyed that. I also loved that Sophia's relationship with Charles progresses over a period of time. It's not that instalove that is so present in writing today. You see them struggle with their attraction to each other and then start dating and then say the L word, in a completely realistic time frame. This novel also had a twist that I didn't see coming at all.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the gaps in time. There are a few times where the novel just skips a month and while I know that if I want my main characters relationship to grow over a period of time, I cannot expect to hear about every moment of it, but I felt like the missing months could have used just a bit more description.<br />All in all, if you love paranormal romance, this is for you. I really enjoyed it and cannot wait to read the next one!

B004EPZ070|1.0|I wish I could give this movie a big fat zero star.  I've watched this movie a few times on HBO.  I had to watch it more than once because I couldn't decide if I loved or hated this movie.  I decided to remain undecided because I loved AND hated this movie.  I loved this movie because I love all happy endings and Colin Egglesfield is mucho yummy looking.  I hated this movie for more reasons:<br /><br />1) cheating in relationships<br />2) lying in relationships<br />3) being a doormat in relationships and friendships<br />4) hate the impression it gives to other women that it's ok to wait around for a guy who's in a relationship and that it's ok to cheat.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin drove me crazy.  Her unrealistic eternal optimism about her relationship with Dex (Colin Egglesfield) is stupid, stupid, stupid.  Colin's Egglesfield character is quite possibly the weakest man (in every sense) in any rom-com's I've ever watched.  Can you say wishy-washy?  Oh and Kate Hudson's character was just hateful.  Her character in the movie was just malicious.  Then again, the characters were a trifecta of stupid.  Ethan (John Krasinski) was the only character that made any sense.  But that's only when he was trying to talk some sense into the main female character (G. Goodwin).
0307279189|5.0|The fact that this book is non-fiction makes the stories and characters all the more interesting to me. I've been inspired to run again, and more than that, was inspired to read again. *Spoiler alert!* There is some decent information on biomechanics, natural history, nutrition, races, anthropology, sociology, and athletics in this work all tied together by the stories within the story and all the wonderful characters. A must read for any runner or athlete.  A great story for everyone else.

B00005JOA0|5.0|This is a bittersweet story based on the novel by Edith Wharton showing the darker side of Victorian England. If you enjoy period dramas such as Charles Dickens and Catherine Cookson, then I think you will also enjoy The Buccaneers. The story traces the lives of four young and innocent girls of wealth in the upper classes of American and England and shows how they must adjust in the harsh reality of the class they live in once they come of age. They are young, impressionable, and looking to marry for affection, but what they discover is that men aren't necessarily bred to feel the same. There are happy endings for some and bittersweet ones for the others.<br /><br />I'm giving it 5 stars, but it's really a 4 1/2 star story because it shows life as it was, not how we would like it to be, and sometimes reality is hard.
0887307280|4.0|First off, this book is about \\"why most small business fail and what to do about it\\".<br />If you're searching for a guide on how to properly setup a startup then read \\"Become your own boss in 12 months\\" by Melinda F. Emerson.<br /><br />After finishing this book, I have learned a lot of useful tips.<br />The business tips are mix-in with the story of Sarah, an owner of a pie shop called \\"All About Pie\\".<br /><br />Overall the author's message is this.<br /><br />The goal of owning a business is to create jobs and sell it.<br />Work 'on', not 'in', your business by developing a set of \\"Francaise Prototype\\" rules for each role and situation.<br />The \\"Francaise Prototype\\" is a manual of key ingredients (developed by innovation/trail & error) for increasing sales and reducing cost for every role in the company.<br /><br />I didn't like the story because it was too long, predictable & boring.<br />Also, I felt like the author was holding back details so that you'll buy into his \\"Turn Key Analysis\\" program.<br /><br />In conclusion, this a great book for entrepreneurs.

B004EBT5CU|2.0|De tanto ouvir falar da tal Adele, inclusive da imprensa especializada que vem \\"endeusando\\" a cantora, resolvi escutar algumas m&uacute;sicas desse disco e, para minha surpresa, eram as mesmas m&uacute;sicas da trilha sonora da novela, da r&aacute;dio AM. Quando li as resenhas dos cr&iacute;ticos achei que ela fazia parte dessa nova geração de artistas neo soul, que, ali&aacute;s &eacute; muito boa, mas ao ouvir as m&uacute;sicas não encontrei o tal neo soul que imaginei, apenas canções pop e nada mais. Mesmo assim continuei não compreendendo tanto barulho por nada, então resolvi ler as letras das canções, uau! algu&eacute;m fez muito mal para essa moça! e o pior ela não compreendeu que o cara não quer nada com ela e quer acabar com a vida dele!!! Talvez seja esse o motivo de ser tão adorada e sucesso de vendas, o neg&oacute;cio &eacute; se vingar! Viva o Tarantino! Mas, sei l&aacute;, entende?

B006H8BIIM|5.0|Finally beat this game last night after obsessing over it for about 2 weeks. Basically a tower defense game, but with a lot of variations. In a nutshell, you've got to defend yourself against progressively stronger waves of attackers, to generate \\"reserves\\" to buy more guns, etc., you need to mine ore from nearby asteroids. The final level - protect both the main station and an allied ship from annihilation - is just near impossible. Very challenging.
B006O5XYWG|2.0|I just can't believe how many people liked this piece of garbage!!!  Scientist Franco rescues a young chimp from the mother chimp who was given a experimental drug.  The young chimp gets smart during the film and organizes a revolt against the humans - what a surprise.<br />The problems with this film:  The CGI chimps are just terrible, I feel like I'm watching a stupid video game throughout the whole movie, it just doesn't seem real.  The plot is silly, corny and predictable, nothing new and different.  Also, there is a complete lack of any type of logic and commom sense with this movie.  Chimps and apes crash through office building windows like its tissue paper - come on get real!  Then the one scene that really insulted the audience's intelligence was when the ape hopped off the Golden Gate Bridge onto a helicopter which was 50 feet away and somehow managed to levitate and hook onto the helicopter, that was beyond stupid.<br />I think the reason people like movies like this is they pay too much attention to their smart phones and are losing a sense of reality.  Smart phones are just making people dumber.

0765365278|5.0|I first read Brandon's work when I bought the Mistborn trilogy after it was suggested to me.  I enjoyed those books, so I decided to see what else he has written, and this one was the next one I chose.  I was not disappointed, and I couldn't put it down!  While the Mistborn series was quite good, The Way of Kings is even better.  The dialogue is better and (mostly) avoids being cheesy, the characters are more three dimensional, the world is in many cases very unique and very fleshed out, and the lore is wonderfully deep.  I liked Brandon's unique magic system in Mistborn a lot, and the magic system in this book is very different and also really well thought out.  The climax was EPIC!  Oh man.  Buy it now.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Lucky for me I got a chance to meet Lou Reed and asked him \\"hey I loved you in Velvet Underground, but how come you're collaborating with Metallica?\\" to which Lou-Lou responded \\"because we have money and F you, that's why\\".<br /><br />So apparently Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich, and James 'The Table' Hetfield took a break from band therapy sessions to record 2011's worst album with Lou Reed. They just hammer on and on in the background while Lou Reed mumbles about wanting a sex change or something, and that's Lulu in a nutshell. I'd recommend you give it a listen just to hear how mind numbingly awful it is.
0545425115|4.0|Okay, so I absolutely could no put this book down after I started reading it. Went through all three books in less than 72 hours. It is compelling, something I've experienced with only two books prior: Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings. I'm not comparing the two compeltely, just stating that perhaps it's just this genre and style that attracts my personal tastes. My 4 comes from the first 2 books. The third book I was not a fan of, the only reason the whole series does not get a 5.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I found myself comparing it to current events in our world. Could such harshness really exist? The answer, unfortunately, is yes, history tells us it can. Not exactly throwing children in an arena to kill eachother, but the lack of concern for human life, using others to maintain your glossy lifestyle, sounds like a dictatorship to me. Sounds like Rome's Gladiators, and human sarifices of other countries, dictatorships throughout the world, and the Holocaust.<br /><br />Some people complain about the horrers of killing children in the book, and I agree it is very gruesome, but it's not like children have never been killed in war. It's not like they're immune in real life to atrocities. I'm nearly 20 so I don't have my mother telling me what I can and cannot read, but I see no point in sheltering teens from this book. Maybe even pre-teens. It may be awful, but the point of using children in the book is because sometimes the worth of human life of an adult isn't really felt. That soldiers are just casulaties of war. But when you use children, it strikes a nerve. There's just something so wrong about using children as pawns. And that's exactly why the author used children.<br /><br />**spoilers*<br /><br />I feel like the need to address the claim that there was no moral development by some other critics. When I read it, I interpretted Katniss' turning on Cain and shooting her as a sign that the Hunger Games, previously voted on, would not happen. I saw thisas Katniss ending the cycle of human atrocities. Now that I read some other reviews, I'm not so sure. I only hope this is what the author had in mind, otherwise I would consider burning the third book of it hadn't ordered it on my kindle.<br /><br />While the book was riveting, it wasn't until after I put down the third one that I was a little disappointed. While there was a happy ending, I feel as if it was not developed enough. I felt like the story was not complete. Almsot as if the author got lazy with the last pages and decided she just wanted to be done writing.  I do not like that Gale just disapears, without saying goodbye... maybe I didn't pick up on the subtle hints that she was going to go for Peeta, but it just seems like the decision was given to her. She would have picked either one that stuck around. I didn't like the two-line answer that was given about it, either. I feel like there should have been more hints that left us at the end, where we can pick a point that shows that she made the decision to be with Peeta long before Gale decided to go off and do his own thing, show some type of reasoning in her actions not just her words. It didn't seem natural. I feel like this is what I kept waiting for throughout the entire series, some point where she realies Peeta - either one of them, hoenstly, wouldn't care which - was the one for her. But no, we only see evidence that he was the one in the very last paragraph of the book.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't stop. I swear I don't think I slept for days. The plot in this first in the new series is developed at a slightly slower pace than his other books. The slower pace actually adds to the richness and superb detail to the storyline.  Sanderson is deft at creating new worlds that feel as if they have really existed in some place and time rather than just made up. His understanding of the delicate relationships between politics, religion and society is mindblowing.<br /> This book doesn't slam you with action immediately but it slowly seduces you. Nothing about this book feels forced. The plot seems to unfold at a perfect pace. It was easy to care about the characters and what happens to them. I also enjoyed the time spent fully developing the cast of characters. Enough time was given to learning the stories of not only what was currently happening to them,  but also to understanding how they have landed in their current roles.<br /> Sanderson also possesses an astonishing gift inventing entirely new and unique magic systems in his novels. So far the magic system in this series is not quite as fascinating as the ones used in \\"The Mistborn\\" trilogy,  but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding it. I am certain in the next installment there will be some major revelations.<br /> There is plenty of action. You can really feel the adrenaline, and basic animal desire for survival as well as the desperation and hope as the characters struggle for their place in the world.<br /> Just based on this first book it is not my favorite of Sanderson 's. I can feel a maturity in this novel that extends beyond his previous books. It feels like this one was written almost like a prequel to the the next books. A very thorough set up so he can just let loose and unleash hell and blow us all away. I can't read any book now without comparing it to Sanderson which makes it difficult to find stimulating reading material. I enjoyed this book despite how it feels more subtle at the start than I am used to. He needs to hurry up and write because I'm desperate to learn more about this mysterious world and what happens next.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Splashtop works amazingly well for troubleshooting computer problems when you cant be present at the machine in question. That is if the computer and network can handle the free streamer program that is needed on the system you are accessing with this app. Thankfully most newer systems can since it doesn't take much to run it in the background. Setup is quick and easy, and only takes a few minutes before you are streaming movies from your home system or helping out family and friends with their computer issues. I'd have given this app 5 stars if not for the company advertising the ability to play Pc games with it. Some games are okay with it but anything requiring movement and camera panning, like rpgs, are nigh impossible. That is on the Kindle Fire at least. I can't speak for other systems.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I was introduced to this movie by my daughter who said this is a picture about a writer who wants to live in the past, who thinks the past is better than the present, and it is about Paris, a place known as the Mecca for artists.<br /><br />I recognized it was a Woody Allen film, and knowing his early works, \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Everything you always wanted to know about sex (but were afraid to ask)\\", I was already biased and not particularly attracted to watch it. My thinking was, \\"oh, another Paris movie, must be about paintings, the arrogant Parisians, and Woody Allen made it? It must be weird.\\" With that mindset and on a boring evening, I sat to see it, mostly because Rachel McAdams (\\"The Notebook\\") was in it. About Owen Wilson, the main actor in the film, the only previous work I liked of him was \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" because I love movies about jet fighters, but I need to admit that I had not seen much of his work anyway.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a tour de force, nonetheless! I saw a very different picture than my daughter described. This movie is about the clashing of personalities: a person with a creative mind, shy, simple and kind of bohemian, as opposed to his fianc&eacute;e representing a modern and materialistic American woman. Likewise, it is about a person encased in the logical world, feeling out of place and eventually breaking from it.<br /><br />Yet, it is a comedy and Woody Allen wrote it masterfully. Owen Wilson plays Gil Bender, a script writer working for Hollywood, who doesn't really like much of his job and would rather become a novelist. He goes to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, as her dad is a successful and wealthy businessman who enters into a merger with a French company.<br /><br />Gil has in fact written his first novel, still a manuscript he's not convinced is good enough and without the confidence to show it to anyone. One night, after a day of touring in Paris with his \\"material girl\\" and her pedantic friends, Gil brakes free from them and go for a walk. He gets lost and at midnight, in despair and sitting on a set of stairs on the street, a Peugeot from the 1920s appear and he is invited to join the people in the car. This car is the time machine that transports Gil to the 1920s. It is reminiscent of the DeLorean in \\"Back to the Future\\".<br /><br />Over several nights, as the trips repeat, Gil meets with writers Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and other artists: painters Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, and film director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel.<br /><br />Allen wrote magnificent lines for Hemingway (Corey Stoll), and one notable is when Gil, influenced by his own low self-esteem, describes his book as terrible. Hemingway replies, \\"No subject is terrible if the story is true, and if the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.\\"<br /><br />This is a story about nostalgia for \\"the golden age\\", but more than being a stage where famous artists of the past come to life, it is about a search into one's footing. Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), whom Hemingway uses to critic his work, tells Gil about his book, \\"We all fear death and question our place in the universe...you have a clear and lively voice, don't be such a defeatist.\\" The critic of his novel, along with those unusual encounters with his literary idols and his attraction with Picasso's lover, Adriana (Marion Cottilard), gave Gil the kick he needed to refuel and find fresh inspiration. Gil discovers a new meaning for his life and a willingness to direct it to a completely different destination.<br /><br />Lest I be portrayed as an idealist, I must mention that Allen romanticizes and embellishes Paris and the bohemian world of the artist, underscored by Gil willingness to exchange his home in Beverly Hills for a little attic with a skylight in Paris. He described the city as one where \\"every street, every boulevard is its own special art form... how anyonecan come up with a book, or a painting, or a symphony, or a sculpture that can compete with a great city\\",  and Paris \\"is the hottest spot on the universe.\\" Additionally, the color of the film has a slight emphasis on orange, depicting the images of the city with a delicate age and warmth.<br /><br />The movie exposes the diametrical contrast of the logical mind with the creative one. Allen has a tendency to discredit the first and enhance the latter through the dialog. However, his scenes portray the artists' nightlife as one where self-destructive behavior like heavy drinking, smoking, and dancing and partying all night long is the norm. Love, or sex for that matter, is exchanged as a commodity. Allen takes the opportunity, as well, to throw a few punches to the Republicans and the Tea Party, describing them as \\"demented lunatics\\" and using the expression \\"respect each other views\\" in the same line, an obvious contradiction.<br /><br />This movie demonstrates Allen's mastering of the script, the scenery, and the conduction of his message through a delicate comedy, which serves as his vehicle to entertain, to expose and display his ideological vision in a very clever manner. However, the characterization of opposite and irreconcilable views are repeated throughout the movie. This is exemplified on this quote from Ms. Stein when describing Picasso's portray of Adriana, \\"He's done her, dripping with sexual innuendo, carnal to the point of smoldering and yes, she's beautiful, but it's a subtle beauty, an implied sensuality.\\" Admittedly, the movie is quite entertaining and a no-less fine presentation that seduces the audience to take a trip to a world of fantasy.book, or a painting, or a symphony, or a sculpture that can compete with a great city\\",  and Paris \\"is the hottest spot on the universe.\\" Additionally, the color of the film has a slight emphasis on orange, depicting the images of the city with a delicate age and warmth.<br /><br />The movie exposes the diametrical contrast of the logical mind with the creative one.

In the adventure mode you are presented with many designs like Egypt symbols and others.  these symbols are so confusing, tiny and very similiar. you are waisting a lot of time just staring at the tiles and spotting the difference.  fun game overall but its not a game i would pay $5 for.

B0052U59F4|1.0|I have seen Twilight referred to as vampire romance with training wheels. Well, this Twilight fanfiction (rewritten with new character names) is erotic romance with training wheels, a helmet, and shin pads.<br /><br />Keeping to all of the God-awful stereotypes set by the vampire series, I found nothing to like here. The protagonist has all of Bella Swan's bad traits: a ridiculous level of clumsiness, a good dose of bitterness, and a downright nasty attitude towards women with blonde hair. The hero is a stock-standard Romance Hero. A place-filler for readers' ultimate Fantasy Man. This means he is not particularly compelling, and not particularly memorable.<br /><br />Too weak to satisfy erotic romance fans, and too out there for the conservative Twilight crowd, this has to be the most over-hyped book since the original with the sparkly vampires.<br /><br />Add to that the poor writing, repetition, and use of British English by American characters (but hey, American historical romance writers are guilty of Americanising Britain all the time - maybe this is payback!), there's really little - if anything - good to say about this book.<br /><br />If this is your first taste of erotic romance, you might be surprised in a good way. Everything is exciting the first time round. But once you're able to swim without those floaties on your arms, go check out a better erotic romance writer - Cherise Sinclair is my top pick.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|More recently  as Steven Spielberg has become a more active producer, his directing credits are becoming less common.<br /><br />In 2011 he produced the brillant [[ASIN:B004EPYZPS Super 8]], one of my favorites, directed by JJ Abrams, the creator, writer and occasional director of Lost, and the recent Star trek. Super 8 is a great nostalgia piece evoking the early eighties, a movie within a movie, and an homage to Spielberg's earliest movies. Spielberg also produced Cowboys and Aliens, a somewhat weird meshing of two genres.<br /><br />Now with Warhorse Spielberg directs, and shows his masterful touches throughout. In fact, if you are like me you can see traces of many great movies of the past. The early portions of the movies showing English countryside scenes, and the musical soundtrack of John Williams are reminiscent of John Ford's The Quiet Man. Trench warfare scenes are reminiscent of that all time classic All Quiet on the Western Front. Incidents relating to deserting soldiers are thematically reminiscent of Kubrick's Paths of Glory.<br /><br />War, as bad as it is, somehow seems worse when an innocent animal is involved, which ultimately makes Warhorse the ultimate anti war polemic. And we have a love story between a young boy Albert, and a horse named Joey. As the movie begins we see the horse being born.<br /><br />Later Albert's alcoholic father instead of buying a proper plough horse, foolishly pits himself agaainst his own landlord in bidding for the flash horse Joey, instead of a huge Clydesdale, making his tenancy precarious, and imperiling his families limited fortunes. Joey faces many trials and tribulations adjusting to the plough. Here we have a wonderful perforamnce from Emily Watson as the mother, cruelly snubbed during awards season.<br /><br />When the war happens the father impulsively sells the horse to the military, despite Albert's protests. Albert, understandably distressed, too young to join the military, vows to be reunited with Joey. Meanwhile Joey goes to the front, and we have a poignant scene with his new owner. He and another horse escape the war briefly, and are adopted by a teenage girl. It's not long before the war interferes again, and Joey has a series of adventures.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when he gets trapped in No Mans land, and both sides have to cooperate to free him. I loved the wire clippers flying scene. I also loved the sub story about the two young German brothers, and the parallel structure about how the British deal with a similar situation.<br /><br />Ultimately the horse is a silent witness to the horror of war, becoming an effective storytelling metaphor.<br /><br />Later in the movie one scene I thought was a little overdone, the moment of blindfold recognition. I like to feel emotions in a movie, but not to have them evoked in a contrived way.<br /><br />Warhorse certainly deserves to be nominated for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, yet I cannot help thinking that actors who vote for awards would prefer as I do to have the story centered around a human character. Nevetheless, when I was a child or young teen I loved watching movies like this, particularly Lassie Goes to war.<br /><br />Another movie I recommend if you don't mind subtitles is the French movie [[ASIN:B000P3GFYM A Very Long Engagement (English Subtitled)]], starring Audrey Tautou, and Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard. A girl seeks her boyfriend believed killed by being sent over the trench deliberately into no mans land for breaking military regulations. It has huge parallels with Warhorse except the protagonists are human, and also operates as a polemic. A beautifully filmed touching love story set against the war.<br /><br />I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.eanwhile Joey goes to the front, and we have a poignant scene with his new owner.

B004EPZ00C|1.0|Because the world was simply chomping at the bit to get more of bumbling secret agent Johnny English back in 2003, he made a return to the big screen eight years later and Johnny English Reborn was... born. I, however, found the sequel only slightly more bearable than the first film and another unfortunate waste of Atkinson's comedic talents. Reborn finds our wacky hero off the grid and training deep in Asia when he is called upon once again by MI7, this time to help thwart an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier; double crosses and pratfalls ensue. If you're familiar with Rowan Atkinson's previous work, then you know what you're getting here. Expect a lot of broad, slapsticky humor in service of well-worn spy spoof clichés, and if that's your thing, then have at it. But, there's no guarantee this will appeal to anyone outside of its target PG demographic.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I absolutely love this cover. I shopped around for covers for weeks before deciding on the Verso Prologue Cover in Red and I am very happy that I did. The cover is gorgeous, supple faux-leather that looks like the cover of an antique novel. Growing up with a library full of old leather bound books, this cover gives my Kindle a similar feel to the novels of my childhood. The inside feels like a faux-suede and makes it a pleasure to hold in your hand, whether you have it open like a novel or bend the spine around for single-handed reading. Everyone that I have shown my Kindle to has commented on how much they like the look and feel of this cover. It is not a super light weight cover, but that is not what I was looking for. I wanted something beautiful that would protect my Kindle when it is riding around in my purse all day. This cover definitely fits that bill. I am very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />To address some of the comments in other reviews:<br /><br />- yes this cover is very snug. It was a big of a challenge to get the Fire into it the first time, but now that it is in I have no concerns about it moving around or falling out. It is snug like a bug in a rug and won't be going anywhere. I was a little worried that it would cause bubbles in the screen protector I put on it since it was so tight (my old iPhone case did that) but I had no problems at all. I am not one of those people who want to take my kindle out of its case very often so the fact that is not easy to get in and out is not an issue for me. I would not recommend this cover for people who need something that can be removed often.<br /><br />- The binding did not lie flat over the fire when I first put it on. the outside edge stuck up a little high, like the spine wa not wide enough for the device. However, like breaking the spine on a new book, I massaged the spine a little, bent it back and forth a few times and now it lies perfectly flat.<br /><br />- the pocket on the inside is very tight,not meant for a lot of added material. I like it though. I can slip a note and my cleaning cloth in there with no problem and no worry that they will fall out.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great cover, but it is not for everyone. It is not for people who want to take their Kindle in and out of the case a lot. It is not for people who want something very light weight and functional. It is for people who want something that looks and feels like a beautiful old book, while still protecting your device.

B000NTPDSW|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I don't understand how people can say these Godfather Blu-Rays look good.  I was very disappointed.  I thought they did a terrible job making these Blu-Rays.  I saw these movies on Satellite in 1080i HD, and I thought they looked better.  After watching all 3 movies on Blu-Ray, I put in my DVD of the Godfather, and my intitial thought was that the DVD was better.  The DVD seems brighter, with less grain. But, then I turned on the Blu-Ray again, and decided the Blu-Ray was better, and had better detail.  But, there is not much difference between the Blu-Ray and DVD.  The Blu-Ray has more grain, but does have better detail.<br /><br />Amazon did change the product description to list the aspect ratio as 1.85:1, which is what it is.  2.35:1 was previously listed.<br /><br />How can some of the reviewers say this Blu-Ray presentation is great?  Are there two different Blu-Ray versions of these movies?  Do I have the \\"bad\\" version?

I may try to give it another listen, but I will have to be in just the right mood for that.

He gives a biographical sketch of the film director and how his education in law school would influence and inform his career as a filmmaker. Hirsch takes us through Preminger's start as a studio contract director on through to his stature as an independent filmmaker working within Hollywood. Naturally, he dwells on Preminger's work in Anatomy of a Murder.<br /><br />There are excerpts from a 1967 episode of the television show Firing Line that sees Preminger discussing censorship with host William F. Buckley Jr. The film director comes across as passionate and knowledgeable as he eloquently defends his stance on censorship.<br /><br />Film critic Gary Giddins talks about jazz musician Duke Ellington's score for the film. He briefly talks about jazz music in films of the 1950s and provides background to Ellington's career. Giddins also analyzes the film's score.<br /><br />There is an interview with Pat Kirkham, author of [[ASIN:1856697525 Saul Bass]]. She talks about the groundbreaking collaboration between Preminger and graphic designer Bass. She gives a brief background to his career and how he met the director.

B0075PYG1M|5.0|I received a review copy of this album a while ago, and have been highly recommending it ever since!    Robert Glasper is one of those rare musicians with the uncanny ability to see beyond what has been done and get straight to the heart of what is possible. He was once described as \\"one of the most promising Jazz pianists for a generation\\", and this album sees him enter a class of his own!    'Black Radio' represents a \\"a true crossover record\\", as Glasper himself put it. It's an amalgam of all the Jazz, Gospel, Soul, and Hip Hop traditions Glasper was raised in. With his Experiment band Casey Benjamin (Sax), Derrick Hodge (Bass), and Chris Dave (Drums), Glasper's `Black Radio' represents a clear progression from his fragmented 2009 offering `Double Booked', which saw half an album dedicated to Jazz and half to Hip Hop. These half-hearted attempts to incorporate Hip Hop into his music appear to be a thing of the past as he embraces all of his influences for his third Blue Note offering, which is sure to serve as an example of how Jazz/Hip Hop crossover should be done.    Glasper and his cohort are individuals pigeon-holed as `Jazz Musicians' that have now proven their reach beyond that or any other Genre. Tasteful isn't a word that can be used to describe many cross-over albums, but it is perfect in this case. Concessions are made in all the right places to ensure that perceptions and expectations are thrown out of the window in favor of the only thing that matters - The quality of The Music.

B006ON41FC|4.0|The game itself is fairly simple and straightforward, you control a squirrel trying to collect nuts. There are various goals that you are given but only three are ever shown at a time and once you complete three you level up. There are a few different kinds of nuts that change the gameplay such as pepper nuts that send you rocketing with very little control or the freeze nut which slows everything down and a poison nut that makes you wobble around and hit trees. All in all it's a good game but you burn through the achievements fairly quickly and there's not a lot to buy in the shop. Also, openfeint is automatically opened without asking permission and until you rate it a box pops telling you to give it five stars. All things considered I think it's worth $0.99

0671646788|2.0|I picked up this book and found it to feel very dated.  The paradigms are dramatically different now, and it wan't what I was looking for.  I suppose I should have scrutinized the first chapter more before buying it.  Basically, if you're stuck in a job that you want to bust out of, and think you're ambitious but don't know how to get from here to there, this may be the book for you.  If you're already on a career arc and ambitious, it would be better to read a more challenging book like \\"Good to Great\\".  Another thing I noticed, almost all of the examples cited in this book were about men, women did not make many appearances.  I also noticed a focus on \\"make more money, get a bigger house, live the good life\\" kind of thought process.  It seems to advocate that you have to be \\"successful\\" to be happy.  Dislike.  Well, take this for what it's worth but I'd recommend moving on.  -Garry

Wonderfully challenging, but not frustrating to the point of giving up, this is a charming space shooter in the style of the original Space Invaders. You have a nice choice of weapons that can be upgraded every round (if you have the credits, of course). The story that the game follows is quite entertaining and wonderfully imaginative. I highly recommend this game. The only complaint is that the main campaign is a little short (3 stages). Get this game!
B00051E906|5.0|Needed something that could verify presence and ... even better the absence of radiation.  Wasn't expecting a lot but this device works as stated, i.e. readings between 0 and 9.99 (Max for device).  Was able to compare values that were close enough for a consumer who just wants to ensure a clean environment.  Suggestions: (1) batteries are best inserted 'nub-first'/positive-end-first AND snug against the middle otherwise it tends to pop out (2) possible places to check the device are in a hospital where people have received radiation treatment (found this out inadvertently) or near an x-ray machine that is used to scan bags (office building).  The digital reading lags the audio which is pretty quick, i.e. registers each particle as a beep or rapid-beeps.
1400069289|5.0|I'm struck after reading this book that most businesses are, at least in part, run incorrectly. What's so insightful of about Charles's thesis is that traditional goals of revenue and earnings don't align individuals inside and outside a company towards a common ground. To say, \\"We want to make more money\\" as a manager creates natural friction in an organization vis a vis how to accomplish that goal. People will naturally disagree about process. Versus, taking an example from the book, Alcoa's CEO said I want to make our business safer, and that created more efficient methods making aluminum. More so, the lines of give and take between employees and the company dissolved, in that everyone was working towards a common goal.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that it has ref-ramed my thinking giving me another lens through which to look at problems. I'd compare it to my experience reading Blink. Both books present a simple, unique point of view that one can co-opt. Habit, like Blink, isn't a process book, but rather a starting point from which on can break old (potentially ineffective) habits, no pun intended, and in doing so push past sticky, repetitive business obstacles.
0439023513|2.0|I had an inkling in Book 2 that Katniss was going to be hijacked: her story, her persona, all that she was--and be used cruelly and for the rebellion's own twisted means. In this respect, Mockingjay doesn't disappoint.<br />-----SPOILERS----SPOILERS----SPOILERS----SPOILERS-----------------------------------<br /><br />But I had no idea that by book's end, she would ultimately be assigned a cage and be bereft of family (her mother) or her friend/love interest (Gale). I knew that this whole saga wasn't going to end up puppies and unicorns, but if at the end, Katniss is left so gutted, that even the presence of her own children give her more dread than joy, why should we care?<br /><br />Is the world she helped to change that much better than the one she was brought up in? When it was made known that the rebels bombed the children (which nearly killed Katniss and did take the life of Prim), when Katniss voted that the children of the privileged Capitol play in a new Hunger Games, I just wanted to un-read the whole tale.<br /><br />War changes us, life changes us, but at the end, what makes us go on is believing that somehow we will make it through, that there is something worth living for. To this respect, Katniss deeply disappoints. It would have been better if she had died than to leave us so completely empty.

0060574216|4.0|This book has very successfully helped me understand relationships better in the fields of communication and romance. It is a rather simplistic book and I agree that the author makes some very broad and generalised assumptions and generalizations, however one should definitely look into this book if they wish to understand the depths of many common problems between each couple. Don't treat this book as a relationship bible, but more as a guideline, particularly when trying to figure out what is going on in your spouse's mind!

B005Q1W0ZQ|3.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey is nowhere near the quality of season 1. The writing is very predictable, but the worst part is that several of the characters personalities have been altered illogically. Good characters are supposed to grow and change from one season to the next, but the changes should make sense based on their experiences and circumstances. There were countless missed opportunities, overly dramatized situations (the relationship of Anna and  Bates becomes extremely uninteresting), and been there done that saw it last week on another channel situations. Just bad writing altogether.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings of season 2, I purchased it as soon as it was released and I watched with delight. Season three is already in production and I am concerned that like season 2, the speed at which season 3 was written and put into production indicated that the brilliance of season 1 will not return. However I will be watching.
0439813786|5.0|Brian Selznick ingeniously captures everything that is enchanting and charming about childhood and slowly unfolds that world of wonder onto the pages of this beautiful book. He tells the story of a boy named Hugo Cabret, who lives in the secret walls of a train station, through a series of alternating illustrations, pictures, and text. Although it is definitely a children's book, it doesn't fit the mold of an illustrated children's book nor does it fit the mold of a graphic novel. Selznick's illustrations and pictures carry parts of the story without the use of any words at all. It strikes me as a rather unique and an overwhelmingly effective storytelling technique without coming off as gimmicky.<br /><br />And let me tell you, the storytelling is superb. Selznick includes just the right amounts of suspense and tension. Add to that an endearing boy and you already have the ingredients for a great book. But, as if all of that weren't enough, the author tops it all off with the history and magic of motion pictures.<br /><br />Nowadays with not just movies but also with the internet and smartphones, we take moving pictures for granted. They do not impress us in the least bit. But at one time, long ago, they were indeed impressive. They were like magic. And Selznick brings that magic, that charm, and that sense of awe back to us through Hugo's eyes.<br /><br />This massive book is paradoxically both long and short. At over 500 pages, it is a brick of a book. And yet, it only took me about an hour and a half to read. In my opinion, time very well spent. I'd like to remark that the only way to experience this book is in a real, physical book format. It doesn't translate into an audiobook, and I don't think it would translate well in an e-book format either.<br /><br />I read this book shortly before I watched the movie by Martin Scorsese. As much as I love the book, I admit that the movie has its advantages. For one, the movie is able to show its audience the old motion pictures in their full glory rather than display just a picture of it in a book. Second, the movie also rounds out the characters more and brings them to life. Overall, I highly recommend both the book and the movie.ictures in their full glory rather than display just a picture of it in a book.

B0045HCJ94|3.0|The two words that best describe drunks is boring and tedious. Redundant, I know. Same could be said for this movie, I'm afraid. At least it's true to life. Except for Otis on the Andy Griffith Show, drunks are seldom entertaining. Granted, the film has an amazing cast, superb director, and despite my feelings that I find these characters extremely tiresome I can still recognize these laudable qualities. Hence, the three stars. I'm not one of those people who can't appreciate films with darker or more somber content, but by and large I do feel the need to identify with them, even if it's on a level I've never experienced before. Despite the great cast and acting, I feel nothing from these people. To Martha and George, I just feel like telling them to shut the **** up. Nobody goes on and on about nothing at all like a drunk. And to their shell shocked guests, who inexplicably come over at 2:00 in the morning (who the hell does that?), why in the world did you keep hanging around this miserable couple? Why don't they just get up and leave? That's the one thing about this film that makes absolutely no sense to me. Same could be said for me, of course. Why did I stick with it till the end?
B0073PZIYI|2.0|Timberlake and whatsherface run around trying to rob whoshername's dad because hes a smelly banker. Heres the interesting part about this movie, the focus is the fact that time=money and there will never be enough. The not so interesting? well the entire human race decided to give up the concept of money in exchange for a genetic clock on everyones arm that is some how updated by either magic hard drive or shaking hands really hard. Why is EVERYONE's clock green? People are still vain, even in the future, surley if they can master clockinyourarm technology they can change the hue of the numbers.<br /><br />The movie has some sex, some running around and shooting, and some kind of heartful lines about how screwed everyone is because the system is a lie. And this is the part where this movie is ruined for me and if you still plan on watching this then don't read this.<br /><br />First off, why are the police so lack luster? If this is such a facist state in which you have to pay \\"time\\" in order to essentially do ANYTHING except take a piss then where are all the cops which really impressive crowd control gear. They probably spent most of the money on timberlake and trying to \\"future\\" out the cars which was a complete waste of money because there is such a difference in quality of cars. In one scene theres the brand new dodge challenger parked next to what is that a bronco II??? Anyways, the biggest problem besides the fact that timberlake and thatotherchick manage to somehow rob a bank and its headquarters completley unscathed, is the lack of any real character. Everyone introduced is sort of thrown away in a couple of minutes and most of the actors don't really seem to care because it's not really believable. Not the concept of the movie, but it's enviroment. Everything looks pretty normal still, and no one's really that bothered. What I mean by that is, if you lived in a world where people were dying all around you every second LITERALLY constantly dropping dead inthe streets because they were essentially poor then you don't think there would be constant screaming and crying somewhere in the backround? There's no tension in this movie despite the obvious plot thickeners. It's pretty much timberlake just running around doing action stuff and expressing his good guy apathy.<br /><br /> Cillian Murphy also plays a character in this movie which is actually the reason why I rented it. Unfortunatley this movie just denies him of any kind of cool scene in anyway shape or form even tho he drives the most exspensive murder mobile in the whole movie(the challenger) but really doesn't even do anything cool with it either so it's actually a complete waste of money (give us scary cops with cool riot gear instead). He wears a trench coat, which automatically makes him the boss, but dies the lamest death I think I've ever seen in a movie. Seriously he just drops dead because he runs out of time, what???? He's called a -> TIMEKEEPER <- You're telling me that this guy who is essentially capable of taking your life via handjob without any sort of probable cause or real reason doesnt constantly carry one of those magic hard drives just in case I dunno, uh, that? Just really though this movie isn't very good. If you're bored or you got a lady friend she might dig it cuz there's some sexy time and chicks dig timberlake but other than that I'd wait for it to hit prime or netflix because you're not missing much.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great series.  Could not put them down.  Now I can't wait for the movie.  :-)<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy will captivate you and transport you to Panem, which is all that is left of the USA 700 years from now.  Panem is composed of 12 districts living under an extremely oppressive government.  Every year, to remind the population of the government's power, a girl and a boy from each district is required to be presented as \\"tribute\\" to fight in the hunger games.  Only one can survive and become a \\"victor\\" and enjoy celebrety status and a plush life no other citizen enjoys (unless you are in the government).  The story begins with the 75th annual game and focuses on the tributes from District 12 and the effect the games have on the rest of the country.  Get the books, get sucked in, and see how it all turns out!

B00457WZEI|5.0|I had to read the book before seeing the movie. I couldn't watch War Horse without knowing what was going to happen. Michael Morpurgo definitely put together an incredibly touching story when he decided to put pen to paper (so to speak) for this one.<br /><br />*<br />In 1914, Joey, a beautiful bay-red foal with a distinctive cross on his nose, is sold to the army and thrust into the midst of the war on the Western Front. With his officer, he charges toward the enemy, witnessing the horror of the battles in France. But even in the desolation of the trenches, Joey's courage touches the soldiers around him and he is able to find warmth and hope. But his heart aches for Albert, the farmer's son he left behind. Will he ever see his true master again?<br />*<br /><br />This story is told from Joey's point of view. It's unbiased and incredibly observant and completely heartwrenching. Joey's sold right out from under Albert's nose by an alcoholic father who is desperate for money. The man who buys him promises Albert he'll take wonderful care of him. And he does, but it doesn't last forever. Joey's story is full of miracle after tragedy after miracle and it's so sad to read. But warms your heart at the same time. Just when you think things couldn't get any worse, they get better. Only to get worse again... only to get better. It's an incredible roller-coaster of a story.<br /><br />War Horse is a fast read. And I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it through without sobbing because I HATE seeing animals hurt or neglected... I can't stand it when they die in movies (seriously, I was a blubbering mess in King Kong and I Am Legend when the dog dies saving Will Smith).<br /><br />It was really interesting to read it from Joey's point of view... kind of gives you a look into the mind and soul of these big, beautiful creatures that we can't get otherwise. He's got an incredibly huge heart and a gentle spirit and there were several places in his story that had me tearing up. I kept having to put my Kindle down because I just didn't think I could read any more. The poor thing just couldn't catch a break! But every time I read something that broke my heart, it was followed by something that put it right back together.<br /><br />I think this would have to be one of my favorite novels. It's absolutely wonderful. I STILL don't know how watching the movie will go (I'll be sure to have lots of tissues) but if it's anything like the book it has to be wonderful.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for everyone.having to put my Kindle down because I just didn't think I could read any more.

At first glance, the exercises that she has you do don't SEEM like they would be difficult, but you really do feel the burn. I'm only a few days in to it, among other workouts, so I won't know for a while what a difference it's making. Ok, maybe that's a lie.

0812979656|4.0|This is a wonderful story if you can stay with it. I've read quite a few books by Indian writers, but this one is certainly the \\"most\\" Indian I've read to date. Roy is tough to follow and hard to understand at times, but her command of language is amazing. The Indian way of running words together and random capitalization is a little weird at first, but after a while I kind of liked it. Her way of spelling words that children and non-English speaking people is good. A \\"Bar Nowl\\" name Oshua.<br />I would have to say that the overall mood of this book is dark and sad. Poor Estha, how much more could a little boy take. \\"Little man with a spoiled puff. Little Man, he lived in a Caravan. Dum dum\\". He seemed to bear the brunt (even if imagined) of everything bad that happened. Hard life for a two egg twin.<br />This will be a hard book to recommend. I think it will mean different things to different people. Some will be repulsed by the darkness. Disease, abuse, ignorance...but a beautiful love story underneath.

0671449028|5.0|I've been reading this book to my daughter since she was about 2 months old. It was and still is the only book that calms her down. Something about the flow and rhyme of the book made it soothing. At two months, she would stare at the pages, enchanted (-I would read it to her laying down on our backs) and it would actually stop her from crying! at three months, she would get excited and kick her feet as I read the book to her. At five months, she would smile at the pages and then at me in anticipation of her favorite lines of the book (\\"...with soap all over-scrub, scrub, scrub\\")  and cackle with glee. Now, she is almost 6 months and likes to hold the book with me as I read it to her (and still smiling and cackling at her favorite parts).<br /> I even have precious video clips that I will treasure forever of myself reading to my daughter, and the priceless reaction that I get from her time and time again. I can't wait to get more of Sandra Boynton's books- I am already sad for the day when she will be too old for me to read them to her.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|OK--if not the movement, itself, I think this documentary states a pretty good case for it.<br /><br />I originally saw this DVD a while ago--but recently, I watched it again with a good friend of mine who happens to be a federal litigator. It's really the preeminent source in understanding what the whole mess of '08 was about and the very fact that more than likely, folks, this will all happen again.<br /><br />Yes, there have been some tweaks-thanks to Obama--but not enough-- as so many of the experts are saying. Anyway, this is a recommended viewing for everyone-and I'd say, especially the younger generations because if this does not get resolved completely--as in reinstating the sanctions that were in place before--that disallowed banks to get involved in the markets, it's going to be big trouble down the line.<br /><br />People have to keep screaming about the sanctity of Wall Street. (and everything the conservative Supreme Court has allowed --as in: the Citizens United ruling)<br /><br />This film states it all so brilliantly. A must-see.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book is a quick read, and was semi-enjoyable, but it was kind of a let down for me. I thought the storyline was OK, but the book was filled with too many predictable cheap thrills (spoiler: especially the ending). I think this would make a great short story, but for a novel, it felt a little boring at times; the author often rehashes old points and descriptions. Also, the fact that I despised the narrator probably didn't help. Overall, it was OK - probably a decent read for a plane ride or something.
B004X75RK4|4.0|I'm giving this chick flick four stars rather than five stars because, although Sandra Bullock is brilliant in it, the movie isn't amoung the best I've ever seen. The story is about a high powered book editor from Canada whose visa has just run out so she needs to get married to stay in the US. She sets her sight on her PA who has no choice but to pretend that he and she are madly in love. Not a brilliant film but very enjoyable way to spend a night in.

B0078XM4SI|5.0|Another great album from the Cranberries! It's very much in line with their previous albums, but I'm okay with that. It's WHY I like the Cranberries. They have a sound. It's the sound that made them famous and it's the sound that I've always loved. Too often, bands are coerced into thinking that they need to \\"evolve\\" (which is studio exec talk for \\"up the trendy\\") and end up with the band doing their impersonation of \\"new sound\\" (or even worse, they bring in a flavor-of-the-moment) The Cranberries don't do that. Ever. They make great music like they know how. Every album is just a little tighter than the last. For this album - think of all the great hooks & riffs, all of the haunting lines and Dolores's amazing, beautiful  & unique voice. I'm sure it'll be the best purchase I make this year!

0553288105|2.0|any value this book has is near completely ruined by the main character. A tour guide on the moon her never ending, never ceasing incessant ranting on her xenophobic viewpoints is laced liberally all over the book. The main character is so unlovable that I would be forced to commit an act of violence against her if stuck with her for more then a few minutes. Anything too stop the jingoist propaganda that her mouth vomits outward at one and all. The sheer volume of her ranting is enough to make one question her sanity.<br /><br />I would say the book did have one important thing to say:<br />the most unattractive quality anyone can ever have is xenophobia and snobbishness. I have learned this lesson from this book and incorporate it in my life.

It plays out JUST LIKE AN EIGHTIES ADVENTURE MOVIE.<br />I like 80s adventure movies though...so I enjoyed it.<br />It has good character dev, quick (my fave) pacing, good arc...<br />The dialog is the weak point.<br />There were confusing character switches where I had to track back and decipher what character, in what order the conversation took place to be sure of whom said what.<br />At times it felt so stilted as to be awkward.<br />I really look forward to his next work

B002SSUQFG|5.0|After reading all the Amazon and internet reviews on this watch I finally pulled the trigger and purchased it for $63 from Amazon.  I've had the watch for four weeks and would like to share my personal thoughts and experiences on the 809.<br />This is a great looking watch.  I wish there was a nicer picture, since it does not do any justice to the looks.  Some folks aren't crazy about the minute markings (5, 10, 15) on the dial, but I like it because it's different than others that have the typical 24 hour (13, 14, 15) markings.  The fabric strap is a definite weakness of the watch.  It felt rather itchy to me to wear.  After two weeks of wearing it, I broke down and bought a brown leather alligator style strap.  The brown strap contrasts with the black dial really dresses up this watch pop.  Now it looks like I spent hundreds of dollars on this watch.  I think a black leather strap and even a NATO style strap with black and a grey stripe would complement this watch as well.<br />This is my first automatic watch.  I purchased it knowing full well that automatic watches are not for everyone.  I also realize that automatics require more care and feeding than a quartz watch and most people will still prefer a quartz movement.<br />Accuracy of automatics is always a discussion topic and the 809 is no exception.  I typically wear this watch for about 12 hours and lose 4 seconds during this period; so theoretically, it loses 8 seconds/day.  This is not bad for a watch that's not certified by the COSC since COSC certified watches are only good for -4/+6 seconds day.  I think some people fail to remember that there are 86,400 seconds in a day and relatively speaking a watch that is off as much as plus or minus 15 seconds a day is still pretty accurate.  If you are still concerned about the watch being fast or slow, I also found a way to regulate this watch.  Since this watch tends to lose time for me, I place it on my dresser, either dial side up or dial side down dependingon how much time I need it to speed up.  By doing this I can gain 2-4 seconds overnight.  If you want to slow down your watch you can place it vertically (using the watch band to support it) with either the crown up or down or even with the crown on the left side if you need to lose more seconds.  You can experiment with these different positions and see what works best for you.<br />Power reserve is another topic that is often discussed about this watch.  Depending on what you read, the 7S26 movement has a power reserve of 38-42 hours.  While you cannot manually wind this watch with the crown, you can still do it by holding the watch horizontally with your thumb and fore finger and make a flicking action with your wrist like you are dealing a deck of cards.  The motion doesn't have to be very hard, but should be strong enough that you either hear or feel a whirring motion.  You cannot over wind automatic watches.  For me, if I do this for five minutes, the watch is fully wound. I also find that winding the watch in this manner for 5 minutes can also speed it up by as much as 8 seconds.  I did check the power reserve on this watch. After fully winding it and leaving it on my dresser, it worked for 45 hours and 23 minutes!  That's pretty awesome with this watch. If you are getting less than the 38-42 hour power reserve, the watch has not been fully wound or you have a defective watch.<br />So far I feel extremely lucky that I got a good working 809.  I am thoroughly enjoying it and will definitely keep it.  It's been an inexpensive way to experience owning an automatic watch.  I highly recommend buying this watch!
B00021HBGS|5.0|My son has lots of great toys but these little foam cars and trucks are his favorite. He seems to always have one or two with him.

0307474259|3.0|Some scientists come up with a theory and then can only see what agrees with it and not what doesn't. Apparently the same thing can happen to a science journalist. From reading this book, it seems that Gary Taubes tried an Atkins-like low-carb diet, had good results losing weight and as a consequence has become convinced that a low-carb diet is the only way to become or stay lean.  In this book, he reviews some of the long history of low-carb diets and also reviews some elements of modern research on fat metabolism (a section he calls \\"Adiposity 101\\"), which he views as supporting the unique effectiveness of a low-carb diet.<br /><br /> The book is fun to read, especially the gleeful attacks on \\"the authorities\\" who make pronouncements on diet and exercise based on little or no data. Taubes is a colorful writer with a gift for concise summaries of scientific papers and for making plausible-sounding connections between science and normal human experience. But his skill in writing is not matched by his judgment and critical thinking about the science he presents. Everything in the book is based on a highly simplistic view: that because eating too much refined, quickly processed carbohydrates like sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and refined flour has bad consequences -which everyone agrees on - that therefore intake of even moderate amounts of carbohydrate from sources like whole grains and fruits is also bad - for which there is no evidence at all.<br /><br />  The key element of metabolism that Taubes focuses on is that intake of carbohydrates produces a rise in blood insulin that promotes production and storage of fat and then produces a drop in blood glucose resulting in increased appetite. This is all true, but it is only part of an immensely more complicated system of hormones and brain regions controlling appetite and metabolism that is only partly understood. (I am familiar with the science, being a research scientist who has taught biochemistry and physiologyin medical school, and follow current research on the neurobiology of feeding and metabolism - a very active field with plenty of objective and open-minded people, contrary to the impression you might get from this book!).<br /><br />  Everyone, including the \\"experts\\" whom Taubes disparages with such vigor, agrees that diets with lots of sugars, refined flour, and other highly processed carbohydrates tend to produce weight gain for precisely the reasons that Taubes discusses, and that the increased consumption of such refined carbohydrates is the primary cause for increased obesity in the US and other developed countries. None of this is controversial. But it doesn't follow that diets including substantial amounts of unprocessed whole-grain carbohydrates are any more unhealthy than the very low-carb diets advocated by Taubes. There are plenty of people - including the vast majority of the sizable fraction of the US population that is not obese - who eat diets with lots of carbohydrates (including moderate amounts of refined carbohydrates like white rice and white bread) who have no trouble staying lean.<br /><br />  The most bizarre element of the book is Taubes' ridicule of the concept that weight gain or loss depends on whether a person expends more calories than he or she takes in. This is simply a statement of fact about the conservation of energy. In the early part of the book, Taubes repeatedly implies that there is something incorrect about the concept and that he will explain later what this is. But when he does tackle the issue, he doesn't say it is incorrect - as he can't - but rather says that it is not relevant or helpful to understanding weight gain or loss. What he seems to mean is that the \\"calories in/calories out\\" view does not give information about WHY people on diets have trouble taking in fewer calories than they expend and therefore isn't useful. It is of course true that \\"calories in/calories out\\" does not explain anything about why any particular diet might or might not be difficult for someone to adopt, but it does explain perfectly whether or not a particular combination of diet, resting metabolism, and exercise will result in weight gain or weight loss. To call this untrue or irrelevant is simply bizarre. It is a necessary first step in figuring out why any combination of diet and exercise does or doesn't result in weight loss.<br /><br />  Also misleading are some wild extrapolations from observations made in various mutant mice to the physiology of ordinary non-mutant humans. For example, he mentions some mutant mice who adjust their activity and energy expenditure to remain obese even when eating a normal number of calories, and from this suggests that normal humans also regulate their activity and energy expenditure in response to their diet - e.g. that highly active marathoners or lumberjacks are driven to be highly active because of their diets, rather than the other way around. Common experience tells anybody that this is absurd for people in any normal range of diets and activity (i.e. not literally starving).<br /><br />  There are lots of similar leaps of logic - e.g. he argues that it couldn't be true that exercising is useful for weight loss because more people exercise regularly nowadays than before, yet obesity is on the increase. But obviously, both can be true if they don't involve the same subsets of people in the country, which they very likely don't. Are the people around you who are avid long-term runners obese?<br /><br />  Overall, this is an entertaining and thought-provoking book, and I enjoyed reading it. But as a guide to what science can currently tell us about appetite, nutrition and weight control, it is simplistic, biased and misleading.
1423136802|5.0|This review is written by my 17-year old son: The Percy Jackson series is probably the best series I have read. For me it outdoes Harry Potter which are really good as well. You are able to see what you are reading; the characters talking, the places they go, and the weapons. The pictures Rick Riordan is able to put in your mind are unbelievable. It truly is like watching a movie in your mind when you read these books!<br /><br />It is an easy read probably between an 8th and 9th grade level, but that's what makes it a fun read! You will find yourself reading something that puts you on the edge of your seat and wanting to skip to find out what happens, but then you turn the page and you are reading 100 pages later and you find out what happens.<br /><br />This series has everything you could want in a book: action, mystery, comedy, and a little romance ;). After you are done with these you will be writing Rick Riordan asking for more. Luckily for you there are!<br /><br />I would recommend Percy Jackson to anyone. You will fall in love with the characters in this book so do not go through withdrawal when you are done reading.

I love movie's of books, but reading the book after the movie, just ruins the book. Almost like a spoiler.<br /><br />I digress. I picked up this book free for kindle with the prime membership and have to honestly say, it only took me about 5 days to read the whole book. (Book 1 of trilogy). But don't think it's because this book is too short or too easy. I just couldn't put it down. I found myself thinking about the main character and how I would act in her situation. I was always curious what she was going to do next. I can't wait to pick up the following books in the Trilogy and see how this ends! I would absolutely recommend this book to teens and young adults. If you prefer a technically challenging book, this isn't it. But it definitely is a fun, entertaining read.
0307959856|4.0|Okay, a little history. I've read precisely one book by PD James, Children of Men, because I like to read the movies. I picked this up because I'm a fan of that book, not because I'm a fan of her police procedurals.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and looking at goodreads and Amazon, I seem to be in the minority. I didn't pick it up expecting Darcy to turn detective, and I didn't pick it up expecting Austen to leap out the pages at me. I picked it up because it looked intriguing and hey, it was. James does a fantastic job using the voice of Austen in a more contemporary, easy-to-access manner. The characters we know and loved in the original story are given a bit more to do, though this novel does not have the breadth and the scope that that one possessed. Darcy and Elizabeth and a lot of Austen's characters are given interesting back stories and more history than Austen gave them, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The original characters fit into the story well and complemented the borrowed characters nicely.<br /><br />Not a masterpiece by any means, but definitely a delightful way to spend an evening. (Or a plane ride, as the case may be.)
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it. it is a good game for a good price. free. I think they should add more to it but awesome overall.
B005WKKI96|5.0|Lila´s new cd is like magical journey to a eclectic mix of mexican traditional songs with modern arrangements. An excelent example of what is called world music, all are songs with no frontiers regardless the language. My favorite songs, \\"Dios nunca muere\\" and \\"Palomo del comalito\\". Absolute recomendation... I love it!
B007E6YYLO|3.0|Seriously? I've read all the reviews up till now & I don't feel the need to say what others are pointing out, but its true! The show is dragging, Lori is a horrible person & I wish she would get eaten (maybe a zombie baby thing would be a nice change), Andrea is anoying, Rick & Shane are morons and the rest of the cast is just thrown in as filler...re-using old plots (already?! REALLY?)and cutting out most of the characters to add in a pointless zombie scene...grrr, its just getting WORSE! Please, someone find the writer from the first season & HIRE HIM BACK at twice the sallery as before, thats the only thing that will save this show!!!
1932735410|4.0|kinda annoying. The book has good material, but the questions are significantly more confusing than the real exam. Also, while she's right that you have to know the order of the process steps, I think that she stresses it too much.<br /><br />Despite that, the book is pretty good. I think that if you read the PMBOK, take her tests, and score in the 70% to 80%, then you should be good to go. That's where I was tracking.

As with other reviewers, I kept wondering if I had the right book or was just not \\"getting\\" the book but now I know that I will not spend another second with this profoundly ponderous, going-nowhere, what's the POINT book!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am dumping this before the first 100 pages and am THRILLED with my new-found FREEDOM from tortuous literary bondage!

0812550706|5.0|Enders game is an incredibly awesome story told from the viewpoint of a small kid who one day, is going to save the planet should he decide he can. Now in space, training to fight the aliens and save the humands. Ender's life an the lives of all other humans is on the line. The intrigue, the strategy, the relationships amongst all the kids involved, and even the two officers who are talking back and forth and determining the childrens fate are just fantastic. I also read Enders Shadow which is equally awesome and told from the viewpoint of Bean. Totally recommend this one.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|This game took me by surprise and kept me addicted for many days. Very good sounds and very pleasing graphics.

1595141979|4.0|I couldn't find this book from the library for the borrowing on kindle books. The only one the series that they didn't have. I was so outraged and frustrated. I looked on amazon and was gonna buy the actual book as I've noticed it isn't on here for the kindle either. So I decided to get on the VA's website and found out there was an app. So I looked the app up and sure enough there was and the best part it had all 6 books from beginning to end. I clicked on \\"shadow kissed\\" and started reading it on my phone a little harder but I read threw the entire book in one day. Despite laundry and kids and life, I manged to read the whole thing. I couldn't put it down. I craved to know what was happening. I thought Christine over reacts over Adrian, but I do see his point. Adrian can offer more than he can by family means and money means. But Lissas heart is with Christine. Rose gets what she's wanted for so long, that her body has ached for. When they first menationed Mason as a ghost I put two and two together. I knew he would be the one to warn Rose. I wish she would of understood long ago but I was so shocked when she figured it out and then turns around the \\"living dead\\" is right in front of her. When she gets back to the dorms she shows how brave she is, she goes after Christine. Rose maybe a lot of things but she did the right thing. Her and Christine team up and take down many. His fire ability comes in handy after all. When it got to the rescue mission I was so mad at what happened to D, that I felt overwhelemed, my heart ached. I felt Roses pain. I was breathless and so stunned. But I knew at the end she would go afte him and keep her promise. I am now on the 4th and halfway through. This series is amazing and I just got Bloodlines to start reading the next series even though I haven't finished this one yet!

B000SEGTI0|5.0|It doesn't blow you away but it also doesn't disappoint.  This is my first Philip Dick novel.  His ideas are both bizarre and brilliant.  His writing is elonquent and messy.  His characters are wonderfully flawed and misunderstood, though in them, you see yourself.  The story just leaves you with a handful of ideas you don't know what to do with, except continue to reflect.  What would seperate us from androids?  What is up with the animals in this thing?  I really enjoyed the journey of Rick Deckard.  Though I still wonder...was he an android?
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|While playing...or trying to play, seems I kept firing the little fella's and their friends off in the wrong direction...became comical then frustrating!  Guess my brain doesn't work like the game's developers.  It has great graphics, it's very colorful and high def.  I would think this would be a fun way to entertain younger<br />people for hours...those who can catch on to which way to drag their finger...LOL<br />its a cute game just not for me.

B005LJK3AC|3.0|This is a funny film, but the hilarity is hampered by the high level of raunchy situations and dialog. A very very R movie. I give it a B.
0439023513|2.0|I found myself fighting and pushing my way through this book, and at 60% I finally gave up and had my girlfriend tell me the ending.  I am glad now I stopped trying.  I got annoyed quickly with how self-absorbed Katniss was and her constant bitching over pointless things was over the top.  The first two books were a lot better, but my advice is to stop there and leave the rest to your imagination.
0316017930|4.0|The book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is a story that follows the lives of outliers, the brightest and most successful people of our time. Gladwell explores the life of each outlier, giving reasons beyond the ordinary as to why these people are so successful. His common goal throughout the book is to answer the question, what makes an outlier?<br /> Gladwell goes beyond the normal idea of where success comes from, IQ, and claims success comes from a whole other variety of factors, from birthdate to family status, to cultural legacies. By exploring the likes of Bill Gates to Bill Joy to Chris Langan (a man with a higher IQ than Albert Einstein, but not nearly as well known), Gladwell attempts to explain why people such as Gates and Joy are so successful and well known, but people like Chris Langan, who is just as smart, if not smarter, is not.<br /> This inspiring account of success stories goes beyond the reasons of success to encourage the audience to take advantage of whatever opportunities they are given and use them to become an outlier. As Gladwell said, \\"Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.\\"<br /> Gladwell doesn't say it's easy to become a success, but he does say it's possible to change the world if everyone were to use his or her opportunities to make our world a brighter place. This book is truly an outlier in itself.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I purchased this light because of my experience with two other Fenix lights that I own, the TK12 and the LD01.  The LD01, being quite small and compact with it's 70 lumens, works great as an everyday carry and the TK12, with it's monster 240 lumen power, does it's job extremely well when you need to literally light up the neighborhood.  The Fenix Compact 140 Lumen Flashlight, AKA:Fenix E-15, fits the need perfectly as a compromise between the two. At around 2.5 inches long and the circumference of a highlighter marker, this thing puts out AMAZING light for it's size!  As others have mentioned, it has no end cap clicky switch, but is operated by twisting the head of the light on and off to achieve the light needed, which is either 10, 75, or 140 lumens.  Of course, the higher the setting, the less runtime you receive.  Low is rated at 30 hours, medium at 4 hours 16 minutes, and high at 1 hour 51 minutes. This little jewel, as most and maybe all of Fenix's products, is made of aircraft-grade aluminum and is very well made as well as being attractive.  It comes with an extra O ring and keychain ring.  Personally, I would choose this light as my EDC, as it runs rings around everything in it's class and size while still fitting reasonably well in the pocket.  Again, as some have noted, it does not come with a battery (CR123A), so be sure to order some.  This was no problem for me, as my TK12 uses a pair and I had some in stock.  All in all the E15, in my opinion, is well worth the money and a great choice for an everyday Jack of All Trades flashlight.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Poppy is a 20 something woman who is engaged to be married to her boyfriend. While at her bridal shower she looses her ring and then gets her phone stolen. While looking for the ring she finds a phone in the trash and takes it. The phone however belongs to the PA of Sam who wants it back.<br /><br />Poppy and Sam work out an understanding and Poppy keeps the phone for a couple of weeks. However she butts her nose into Sam's business and starts reading emails and text he gets and sends. Because of this she becomes involved in uncovering a mystery about the company Sam works for. During this time there are sparks between Sam and Poppy as they email and text each other, sometimes about business but often not (especially as some interesting things about her fiance come to the surface.)<br /><br />There are only a couple things that I did not care for. One was the footnotes. It got annoying having to try to get the footnotes especially if there were two or three on a single page.  The other was the character of Poppy. In almost every single book of Sophie's the main female character is almost the exact same. Poppy is almost indistinguishable from Rebecca from the Shopaholic books, Emma from Can You Keep a Secret,  Samantha from Undomestic Goddess and Laura from 20's Girl.<br /><br />Overall a good, light read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I kept hearing about The Hunger Games but I never really paid much attention to it and then one day I finally decided to buy it and see what all the fuss was about. And boy, I get it now... I do!<br />This is such a unique tale, told so beautifully by author Suzanne Collins. Every scene was so vivid in my mind as I followed the adventures of Katniss as she fought for her life in the Capitol's arena, designed specifically to host those horrendous games where children must fight to the death. I'll be buying book two very soon. Brilliant, just brilliant!<br />I've seen the movie trailers and I can't wait to watch this on the big screen now!<br /><br />Suzy Turner, author of The Raven Saga<br />[[ASIN:B004ZZJ462 Raven (The Raven Saga)]]
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All of you people that are hating because the original films were not included in this package, there is no sense in rating this 1 star, be smart and read what you are purchasing before you do so.  I have loved Star Wars since I was a kid, watched it on VHS, DVD, and now, beautifully in Blu-Ray.  Sure there are the ocassional unnessary additions, but that doesnt take away from the beauty that is this films fully remastered and looking more beautiful than ever.  The sound has been remastered and sounds amazing with my Vizio soundbar! I couldnt be more pleased with this product, great job by George Lucas.  The packaging is amazing too, definitaly makes it a keepsake and a collectors item.

If you are looking for a fascinating read, get this book!!!

B004P8JPS6|4.0|He is only 36 years old in this book and shows us how he separated from the military. We had always been told he was under a cloud when he left but not how or why. Here, military bureaucracy is shown in full flower with Reacher as a maverick who couldn't last under that totem yet was indispensable as their hit man. Where he is dispatched this time is to Carter Crossing, Miss. There is a midnight train that is central to the plot, and an ex-Marine female sheriff. All the women, dead or alive, in this story are beauties, including Elizabeth Devereaux, the sheriff. Reacher is the investigator of the murder of one beauty, then the murder of two others, while you wonder whether the sheriff is destined to be the fourth. Reacher is the investigator outside -- and his counterpart is the official investigator inside the town's military army base of Kelham. It is nice to find out that the insider, a Major Munro, is intelligent, capable and honest, which is a relief amidst all that corruption of the actors in the story.<br />Also, this is the first Reacher novel I have noticed depicting him in a torrid affair. It is all done in the author's trademark style, in short sentences that are anything but torrid. Good going, Lee Child.

B005LAIGRS|5.0|When the title of a movie is Safe House, one can assume that this CIA safe house in South Africa is any but safe for its intended guest, Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) a rogue CIA agent.  Daniel Espinosa keeps the movie moving  at a good clip with smart cinematography.  Denzel Washington is believable and classy.  Ryan Reynolds provides a good supporting role as a CIA safe house keeper.  Overall, one of the best  thriller action movies in the past year.<br /><br />If you are interested in other great CIA movies, please check out Body of Lies(Leonardo Dicaprio), The Recruit(Al Pacino with Colin Farrell), and Spy Game(Robert Redford with Brad Pitt).

B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have never read a book about North Korea before. I was very interested in what goes on there and the fact that the people there believe so whole-heartedly in what they are told by the dear leader. IE: turning grass into meat or that Americans are vile, lawless people who would sooner kill them than not.<br />The book is not an easy read. It jumps back and forth in time and place and voice. You do have to put some work into it. It's not just a quick and easy read that you will forget in a day or two.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban's \\"How To Win At The Sport of Business\\" was a great, informative fast read. As a sports fan, I was familiar with Cuban's career as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. But I was not very knowledgeable about the details of his very successful business career. His book covers many aspects of his career, written in a straight-forward, pull-no-punches style that you would expect from Cuban.<br /><br />Along with interesting stories about his career, the book is full of great advice to business owners, especially those starting their own business. His advice to pursue your \\"destiny\\", find \\"the edge\\", to work hard and play hard and that it doesn't matter how many times you fail, because \\"you only have to be right once\\" are ideas to remember. I found the most meaningful advice to be to take the time to continuously read and study and learn new things, which is hard to do when you are caught up in a busy day-to-day lifestyle. Cuban stresses that always making time to read not only builds up your knowledge base, but it can lead to the next new, good idea. Sound advice.<br /><br />Lance Ryskamp
0312641893|5.0|I read this book in one day. I haven't done that in a very long time. A book really has to grab me and not let go in order for this to happen. I spent less time surfing the internet between chapters and more time devouring this book.<br /><br />I cannot express how much I loved this book. There are no words.<br /><br />It is a retelling of Cinderella. But, there is so much divergence from the original, that even following the classic storyline, you're unsure of where the book is going to take you. There are people who live on the moon, it's a country run by a dictator who keeps everyone in check by using magic. A plague has also originated from the moon, brought to earth by Lunar fugitives. With a missing princess, a conspiracy, an adorable android and a romance that didn't eclipse the story, the action never lags.<br /><br />Sure, there's a ball, a lost 'shoe', an evil step-mother and other things you would expect from the classic tale. There is also a fairy godmother, only gender-swapped and lacking the classic fairy godmother attributes.<br /><br />There is a romance, but the characters are so interested in the next thing that is going to happen, that they don't dwell on it to much. They like each other, and one seems more enthusiastic than the other, but even if it were to come to fruition, there is so much standing in their way.<br /><br />The next book in the series doesn't come out until 2013. I can't wait.

B001E25MBK|5.0|The Godfather trilogy: The Coppola Restoration in Blu-Ray is the definite collection for Godfather fans. The presentation is very nice, comes in a nice looking box. The audio quality is top notch, and the video, although it has some grain, looks every bit as nice as the original movie in the theaters. Remember this is a 70's movie, and in my humble opinion, even in Blu-Ray this should look like that. Worth every penny.
1594202842|5.0|So who are all these losers who are giving a 1-star rating to this phenomenal book? Let me tell you about this side story. A few years ago, I was researching compact digital cameras and based on some very high ratings on Amazon, I bought this particular Panasonic camera. The results produced by this camera were terrible. Initially, I thought that it was my fault - maybe I had to change the settings, etc. But after months of tinkering, I finally gave up and made peace with the fact that the entire model was a lemon and no amount of firmware updates, settings, etc. was going to solve the core problem - it was just a bad camera. I went back to the Amazon reviews once again and focused now on all the 1 and 2 star reviews. And there I had it - reviews from other people with the same experience as mine. I had somehow missed it initially because these 1 star reviews were buried in the midst of these massive 4 and 5 star reviews. And then it struck me, that Amazon ratings do not have a weighting on them. A lot of novice photographers, who were probably used to standards set by cell phone cameras, considered this camera as manna from heaven. Their benchmarks were all wrong. And I had relied on these losers to make an informed decision??<br /><br />The point that I'm trying to make here is that we don't know the background of all these 1 and 2 star reviewers who have panned Amy Chua's book. What are their credentials, success stories, etc? I believe that they represent most of the losers, who have never accomplished anything in life and have an inferiority complex against super achievers. They are in denial about the amount of effort that you need to put in to raise a prodigy. Michael Jackson achieved whatever he did because his dad instilled a sense of discipline from a very early age. While he grew up hating his dad, he did still acknowledge the fact that his dad was responsible for his success. Let's also be mindful of the fact that some of these negative reviews were probably planted by folks who represent the interests of companies that peddle goods and services to parents (the very activities that have been disavowed by Amy).<br /><br />The key takeaways from this book for me were:<br /><br />Say no to Auto-pilot parenting: Don't rely on the establishment to take care of children's needs. We had enrolled our daughter into a day care operated by the nation's biggest daycare chain and got lazy enough to go into an auto-pilot mode. Alas, their educational standards turned out to be very low. Had it not been for this book, we'd been just like the other parents who are paying a lot of money to these daycare centers and taking false pride in the fact that their 4-5 year old kids are being taught how to write basic alphabets (while similar kids elsewhere are able to read sentences and write complex words). Similarly, don't expect your nanny to know what's best for your child.<br /><br />Suzuki Music: I credit this book for introducing us to the Suzuki Method of teaching music. Given all it's shortcomings, this is the only method that gives us some continuity in the teaching method (if we end up relocating). We also love the logical progression of the program as children graduate from Book 1 to Book 7 (with increasing complexity). After this book, my child is never going to attend one of those Mommy and Me or Gym-time music classes. Inspired by this book, we enrolled our 5 yr old daughter in a Suzuki program and I can attest on behalf of the author that - it's very hard to learn the violin. There are so many facets involved in playing the violin correctly.<br /><br />Classical Greats: This book introduced me to the works of the some of the biggest composers of Western Classical music. In an era where the mainstream media equates quality of music with popular `thrash' music, I feel like this book does yeoman service to the classical music industry. You can almost hear the works of Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Bach, etc. from Sophia's piano or Lulu's Violin. Maybe the next version of Amy's book will include the audio clips from her daughter's recitals/performances.<br /><br />Instead of finding faults with Amy's parenting style, the readers should focus on the positives of this book. Amy does not anywhere suggest that the world adopt her style of parenting. And instead of labelling Amy as a tyrant and what not, how many reviewers actually give her credit for her untiring work to raise her kids (while juggling a stressful career)? She too sacrificed a lot of her personal life/time to give her 110% to her kids. Which meant - no girls' night outs, no mindless socializing, etc.<br /><br />This book should serve as a wake-up call to all parents (who aspire to raise achievers). For us, this book should serve as a guide to encourage positive pushing, cordial upbringing, focus on academics and classical music, toning down on the mindless play-dates or any other children's activity that the MSM has brainwashed us for many years as a must-do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent story which is incredibly different from anything I have ever read. I don't get what any of the negative reviews are about. I was told that I wouldn't be able to put the book down and it was the truth. I'm a 30+ year old man and loved it. Not sure why this is considered young adult fiction, but I think that almost anyone who loves fiction can enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the other 2 books, which I'll probably finish within a couple of days.
0321146530|3.0|This is one of those books that I would have rated more highly a few years ago. TDD is not a particularly complicated concept and, these days, it's not particularly new either. Thus, the explanations I've come across online and the one book I've read on the topic have been quite sufficient exposure, making reading another book on the topic superfluous.<br /><br />That said, Beck's book was, in my opinion, better than _Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide_ by David Astels. Astels book is not bad, but it's over 500 pages long, and TDD just isn't really that complicated. Beck's book, at ~200 pages of fairly spacious typesetting, is much more proportional to the complexity of the topic (websites are even shorter, but I prefer to read books).<br /><br />In short, if you are interested in learning about TDD -- and I think it's an approach all programmer should learn about and apply judiciously but not religiously -- I recommend reading about it on the internet and then, if you're a book person or want to see a more extended example, read Beck's book.
B0070066DI|4.0|Finding a good heat sink that will fit in a thin HTPC case like a Lian Li PC-C37 (3.7\\" tall) is challenging!<br /><br />But this little cooler does the trick! At full speed the fan is noticeable (but not awful). The fan is PWM, so any modern motherboard will run it at very low speed (~300-400 rpm) for almost all use with an i3-2100 CPU (if the BIOS is set-up properly). Even running OCCT for an extended period only slightly increases the fan speed, although this cooler would easily be overwhelmed by an overclocked i7-2600K running full-bore!!<br /><br />For my installation, this is the only fan in the entire system (Seasonic X400 fanless power supply). The result is a nearly silent (to my ears) HTPC. The slow SATA HDDs are basically the only noise sources, and only audible when seeking.<br /><br />Installation is non-trivial, requiring simultaneous access to both sides of the board. The included directions are very poor, with no simple cross-reference to the labels of various parts mentioned in the written steps. Fortunately the diagrams are reasonably clear, so I was able to eventually figure everything out, and subsequent installations will be very easy (but always will require simultaneous access to both sides of the board).<br /><br />As of February 2012, unlike the description on Amazon's site (and also on Scythe's site!), the *ONLY* change for \\"Rev B\\" is Socket LGA2011 compatibility. The fins, heat-pipe count (5) and fan are identical. Scythe has simply updated the mounting kit.
B003IY48PS|4.0|Working with a very limited budget and shooting over a couple of years, Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Bruce Campbell, and Joel Coen (along with many collaborators) managed to produce a horror movie where five college students, while having a weekend in a rented cabin down in the woods, uncover a book called the Necronomicon, which releases the spirits of the dead who now haunt, curse, and torture the five college students over a single night.<br /><br />Shot on 16 mm, the movie shows clever use of the camera, which is not only used to film the characters' actions, but also to play the role of the spirits of the dead as they track and haunt Ash and his friends. The music, composed by Joseph LoDuca, is very effective and adds the perfect tension to the story, along with a few comic elements like during that scene between Ash and Linda when he wants to offer to her a gift. Evil Dead also has lots of gore and clever use of stop motion to show the characters transformation into dead living creatures. The smoke effects in the forest also gave an eerie presence to the wooden cabin and the surrounding woods as they gave another visual demonstration that the evil forces in the Necronomicon were haunting the characters.<br /><br />This movie also reveals the genre-bending traits of Sam Raimi's movies, as he mixes both comedy and dramatic scenes in his stories and productions. For this movie, it works pretty well though the only few criticisms I had with the story was that there were probably too much characters, including some that were underdeveloped like Shelly. I also felt that the story dragged around the end, like when Ash is trying to get his grip to what is happening or when the corpses decompose themselves, and could have been shortened at seventy minutes. Nevertheless, the story was fun to watch and I especially liked the final camera trick at the end of the movie, which to me will probably become, and maybe already did, a classic element to horror movies.<br /><br />Although the movie did had some continuity mistakes (i.e.: hair cuts, light directions, etc.) which were due to the shooting constraints that Raimi and his team had on the film's shooting which went over a couple of years, I admired the energy and will that comes out of this project as a couple of people managed to make a movie that launched their careers, but also a series of movies set in the Evil Dead universe, including a sequel that revised for better the events of this movie with only two characters (the most interesting ones of this story and combined with traits coming from the other characters), an excellent ending, and less gore than in this first version.hough the movie did had some continuity mistakes (i.e.: hair cuts, light directions, etc.) which were due to the shooting constraints that Raimi and his team had on the film's shooting which went over a couple of years, I admired the energy and will that comes out of this project as a couple of people managed to make a movie that launched their careers, but also a series of movies set in the Evil Dead universe, including a sequel that revised for better the events of this movie with only two characters (the most interesting ones of this story and combined with traits coming from the other characters), an excellent ending, and less gore than in this first version.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|This album starts off like a house of fire, and kicks butt with some of Van Halen's heaviest songs ever.  Mean Street kicks the disc off hard and heavy, followed up by a slower, but still heavy Dirty Movies.  Sinner's Swing is an upbeat, fun rocker, follwed by the slightly less heavy Hear About It Later.  The next song on the docket is perhaps the heaviest, and among the best, VH songs ever made: Unchained.  This song rips right out of the gate with one of the hardest rocking guitar solos you've ever heard and it rips  throughout, only pausing in the middle for the famou, \\"come on, Dave, gimme a break\\" to which Roth replies, \\"One break, comin' up!...which gets us right back to Eddie at his heaviest and best.  The first 5 songs on this album are 5 stars all the way.  Unlike most DLR VH albums, though, this one loses some consistency in the second half.<br /><br />Push Comes to Shove, Sunday Afternoon in the Park, and One Foot Out the Door pretty much fill out the back half of the disc and just all sound like B-side songs to me.  In fact, these are the only 3 songs of the entire DLR-era of the band that I really don't like, and the fact that they are all on the same album brings a 5 star beginning down to a 4 star finish.  One exception to the rather weak second half is the song So This is Love? which is a very good, hard rockin' song.<br /><br />So, while I don't consider this VH's best disc because of the weak back end, the good songs on it are very good, with Mean Street and Unchained being among VH's best.  I would definitely recommend this disc to all fans of Van Halen and heavy metal/hard rock in general.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Several weeks ago I ordered a copy of ADKOT on line and basically forgot I ordered it. I then picked up a copy of ADKOT in the local WalMart and was surprised at how good it was. Very good VH sound on most tracks with the only throw away being the 3rd track \\"You and your blues.\\" (It sounds too much like an old Sammy era track.) Anyway, I'm enjoying my WalMart version of the VH album and the version I ordered on line shows up in the mail. Duh! So, I open it and notice that all of the packaging is in Japanese. Now I am curious! I put it in and push play and was amazed at what I heard. While the US version is good, it is muddled and loud compared to the Japanese version. The Japanese version really pops - clear vocals (for DLR), crisp guitars, shining cymbals, etc...Every instrument has a place in every song unlike the US version where it sounds like all of the instruments are trying to club you over the head at the same time. For some reason the Japanese version was recorded or mixed differently - and this is a good thing!!! It makes the entire album MUCH more enjoyable. Does anyone know why the Japanese version is so much cleaner and better sounding...or is it just my aging ears??
B005LL4U54|5.0|The music for The Artist was truly perfect and set the mood for the film.  I found myself humming the main theme throughout the day after I left the theater.  I ordered the CD two days later and have enjoyed it numerous times since then.
B007E6YYLO|5.0|If I could only watch one show I would probably watch Justified but this is a very close 2nd. Oh, I forgot about Breaking Bad, and Dexter. Glad I don't have to choose.<br />I know it is based on a comic book but I have never seen it and couldn't care less if it follows it or not. I think the writing is excellent and if they did fire the original writers the new ones are doing a fine job.<br /><br />I agree with others that at some point they should move on from the farm house to keep things interesting and unpredictable BUT...<br />If I were in that same situation I would be in no hurry to leave the farm house. You have fresh water, a renewable food supply, and relatively few zombies. And when they do occaisionally stumble out of the woods you can see them coming from a mile away since they have to cross an open field to get to the house. I think the only way it would make any sense to leave is if something drastic happened like the house burning down. Even then, the location is still ideal and I think I would either rebuild it or go scavange for more RVs or even find a truck and drag some abandoned mobile homes onto the site. In any case I think the writers need to give them a very compelling reason to leave or it won't make sense.<br /><br />I think Rick is without question the type of person I would want as the leader of the group over someone like Shane. Rick has proven that he can kick A$$ when he needs to (both in this and the previous episode) yet he knows how to be a diplomat when the situation calls for it. Granted there is no room for diplomacy when it comes to the Walkers but there are other groups of survivors out there and the answer will not always be \\"Kill 'em all, let God sort it out.\\" but that is the only answer Shane knows. Before the apocolypse they were both cops. Would you rather be pulled over by Rick or Shane? That said, someone like Shane can be very valuable to the group, just not as the leader. I think in this episode Rick did what he needed to do to reestablish himself as the Alpha Male of the group.<br /><br />Shows like this are very expensive to make and unfortunately have a limited audience. There are just a lot of people who you will never convince to watch just because there are \\"Zombies\\" in it. I know. I tried. No matter how good the writing and acting is. The same goes for shows about space smugglers with an old west theme, or robots from the future, etc. I love these types of shows. If you are reading this then you probably love these types of shows too, but we are a minority. It is understandable then that the budget for a show like this has to be limited if it is to turn a profit at all. No profit, no show. That's just plain old economics. Legal dramas for example are cheaper to produce and have a potential for a much larger audience. I like those too when they are well done. I recently checked out The Firm 2012 on HULU and liked it.<br />So I am ok with a few compromises if it keeps the show in production. You want an episode with more zombies? Fine. Some of the supporting cast will have to sit out. You want an episode with a lot of involvement from the supporting cast? Ok. We'll have to cut way back on the zombies.<br />I am ok with this give and take to keep a great show going. Maybe for the season finale you say \\"To hell with the budget! Bring on the zombies and hand Dale a shotgun!\\"<br /><br />I love this show and am very much looking forward to the rest of this season and beyond. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for some solid entertainment.

B001QFYCZM|3.0|As a 1951 movie, A Streetcar Named Desire was filmed and projected in the Academy aspect ratio of 1.37:1 (full screen). The Blu-ray release specifications list it as a \\"widescreen\\" (1.77:1) presentation, meaning that picture information will be cropped from the top and bottom. Personally, I think it's shameful that studios assume they have a license to mutilate classics so they conform to today's 16:9 monitors.
B007AQJBCA|5.0|This is probably the best TV show I have seen regarding the black cop program. AIll the actors are amazing very well composed.

B00005Y7KX|5.0|This amazing french-canadian musical production based on Victor Hugo's drama made me get marvelled from the very first minute of audience. From dancers to singers, an absolute strong cast under the guidance of a fully talented staff! Wonderful stage arrangements, powerful lyrics and melodic songs that made me feel completely dizzy of pleasure... I'd strongly recommend!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|It's rare when something that's been anticipated for so long actually lives up to expectations. This album exceeded anything I could have hoped for. It brings me back to the days of Women and Children First. If you liked the first six VH albums, you will love this album. Eddie is in peak form. David Lee Roth sounds like he hasn't missed a beat since he liked the way the lines ran up the back of the stockings. Don't miss Outta Space, She's the Woman, and Big River for that old school sound. As Is and China Town rock harder and deliver more blistering guitar work than should be possible for guys in their fifties to pull off, but they do more than pull it off. They execute it perfectly without sounding like they tried too hard. If you have only heard Tattoo on the radio and were just lukewarm on it. fret not, the rest of this album absolutely kicks ass. Great stuff.

0439023521|3.0|I am a 20something year old grad student in 7th year of post-HS higher education; I read The Hunger Games primarily so I could be caught up on the hype in case I decided to see the upcoming movie. Although I definitely enjoyed the idea of this story (a fight to death in a post-apocalyptic world) and welcomed it as a quick, easy read, at times it was very one-dimensional and the \\"yteen-ness\\" of the story really showed through. This isn't a complaint, because obviously this is specifically a book in the Young Adult genre and I knew that \\"going into it\\". All in all, a good book to read in order to keep your pop-culture knowledge at its peak :)
1597371416|4.0|I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful.  Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley?  Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled?  WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?<br /><br />Who cares?!<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents.  I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then.  I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that.  It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable.  But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.<br /><br />Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc.  This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book).  However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, \\"When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!\\" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect.  She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.<br /><br />Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?).  Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.<br /><br />But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part).  On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!<br /><br />Three and a half stars.her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?).

B001FOPODS|1.0|Saw the movie a couple days ago on Netflix.  The puppets were really creepy looking.  I would not buy this video for young children. The puppets were really ugly and uninteresting to watch.  Also my kid didn't stay longer than 2 minutes to watch.  I just fast forward most of the movie to see what was happening.  Definitely don't understand how this won an academy award.  I did not enjoy it at all!  Would not recommend.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|If you haven't read the book, or seen the mini-series with Alec Guiness, I simply can't see how one could understand the plot. There simply isn't enough information in this movie. It is a synopsis of the entire story only, due to overall story's complexity.<br /><br />I wondered about how they would re-create Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy into a two hour movie without leaving out alot of relevant material and clues into who the mole is/was. This could easily have been a 3 hour movie, and still much would still have been missed. What proves my point as an example, is Smiley's meeting with Karla is only mentioned in a conversation over drinks. Instead of showing the actual face to face, which is an important turning point in the story. The lighter! Remember?<br /><br />Anyway, it gets a one star, for turning a good spy story into a confusing, watered-down version.<br /><br />Watch the mini-series, then read the book. Then you'll know what I mean.
B000003BF4|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the top ten rock albums of all time. The guitar playing is impeccable from start to finish. If you are an aspiring guitar player, this album is the perfect place to go to to pick up some of the best Chuck Berry guitar riffs, rhythm guitar chops, melodic blues leads, and the essence of how to play tight. After listening to this album for the past 30 years on a regular basis, I think it is as close to perfection as a live rock CD can ever be. Even if there are a few overdubs.I saw them play with Mick Taylor at the 1972 Nicaraguan benefit and THIS album is a great representation of what they were at the time.. the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. This is, without a doubt, an absolute \\"must buy\\" for anyone who loves rock n roll at its very best.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I'll admit, when I bought this album I was jumping on the bandwagon. I'd heard three of Adele's singles off of this album by the time I actually bothered to purchase it and see what else she's got. Turns out I would not be disappointed.<br /><br />One of the first vibes I got from listening to this was that of Carole King. Discovering that Adele at least co-wrote all but one songs on here only reaffirmed that to me. Her voice has such a hauntingly beautiful tone that can both move one to tears and packs a powerful punch to catch you completely off guard. Once I heard that many different demographics were in love with Adele (not just the pop kids of this generation but people in their 60s and 70s who definitely know how to appreciate good songwriting) it gives me hope for the future of the music industry that we could possibly begin to see great musicians rise from the woodwork and try to compete with Adele's talent. Not to mention driving the industry away from the image driven mentalities that so many artists try to front nowadays. Adele is great music, and I have no doubt that this album will definitely raise the standards for all musicians hoping to make it as big as she has.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|There was wonderful renaissance of neo-soul music that peaked in the 90s and was a wonderful soundtrack for the lives of urban contemporary music lovers. Robert Glasper is undoubtedly and purely inspired by the music of that era. A hybrid of soft jazz, hip-hop, and R&B, Black Radio is the soul music lover's 'Hearts of Space' odyssey. It is the F.M. dial to beautiful music that I could not recommend more highly.<br /><br />He has drawn in some of the most respected musicians (Lalah Hathaway, Lupe Fiasco, Erykah Badu, Ledisi, Bilal to name a few) to contribute their talents to what will be one of my favorite albums this year. I hate to highlight any songs in particular because the entire album is consistently wonderful from beginning to end - so I won't.<br /><br />It's intriguing that two of my favorite musicians, Robert Glasper and Esperanza Spalding, are releasing CDs this year with the word 'radio' in the albums' titles. (Esperanza's CD is entitled 'Radio Music Society'). With so much music becoming popular based on spectacle and ridiculous antics (as he touches upon at the end of \\"Gonna Be Alright\\"), it's refreshing and reassuring that artists like these are keeping the focus on musicianship. Black Radio is Robert Glasper at his best!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Perfect for what I do daily. I can do Bible study anywhere and few even know I am. Cool and the blessing from the Lord out rank everyone objecting to my reading any Bible for my spiritual needs . This is so cool doing this!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great app for Kindle Fire.  Has lots of goals to complete and stuff to unlock. Worth the 99&cent; but I got it free
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think for a free game, its good..no more ads than any other free game. could use better instructions for some of them but all in all pretty good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is amazing and never want to stop playing ... I do really recommend this wonderful  game....  :-) If you like solitaire with this you'll love it!!! :-)
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I nabbed this as the FAOTD and played it for at least a couple of hours yesterday. I had a lot of fun with it and made some great progress but today there is an update that wants to uninstall the game before installing the updated game. From past experience this blows away all user data and you have to start from the beginning all over again. There is no excuse for writing software this way. This is just amateurish and if I have to uninstall the game then it will remain uninstalled. Too bad, too. I really liked it.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|I'm not a big fan of gore but I can appreciate it when it underscores the reality of violence in film. That being said, I found the gore in this film to be a grating and misplaced addition to what was turning out to be a really interesting story.<br /><br />I really like many components of this movie, it was well made and really successfully created an amazing anti-hero persona in Ryan Gosling's character. I just found the violence, more so the gore, a little too jarring when juxtaposed to the pace and tone of the majority of the movie.<br /><br />I appreciate the intention behind showing the ugliness of violence but I feel like it was inconsistent with the rest of the film. There was a way that the classics handled those kinds of scenes that would have fit perfectly in this film...
B0067LY4WG|2.0|As much as I like Leonard Cohen at his best, and as many purchases as I have made of his work, I was still curious what this album might have to offer. With glimpses of the genius that certainly is part of this artist, this time around I found the whole exercise low on energy, almost whisper like in its rendering vocals and not much excitement to be found, either lyrically or musically. The admiration I have for Mr. Leonard Cohen does not diminish with this effort, for he has certainly forged his body of work throughout the years. So to the caesars what belongs to the caesars, his life is already bordering on a mixture of enlightenment and artistry, and his poetry has elevated him to the ranks of the gifted. Perhaps the nature of the recording place where he made Old Ideas, or the passage of the years, the end result is one of do not listen while on the road or it might induce sleep on critical moments. His words still resonate, yet less so on the whole. The music continues to be predictable, not very innovative, and the overall tone one of low energy and whispering plights. Old Ideas sounded, well, old, and in this fashion it does not disappoint. I purchased two copies, sent one to my brother and kept the other one. Upon listening the CD I knew I would not be returning for more any time soon. I understand that initially money issues forced a comeback, and after purchasing the live recording of that tour I was very happy, for I could tell his audience loves and respects him very much. Some of his songs are truly life altering, in their insight and power, and some are just songs. This album, as a couple of tuned in reviewers have pointed out, lacks the wow factor.  Not his best work by a long shot, one or two songs somewhat interesting enough to listen, but that is it. Did not like it, and this is so slow at times and so devoid of energy, that actually makes one sleepy on the road. 2 Stars.

006197806X|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Lauren Oliver since her debut novel, Before I Fall, which remains in my top five favorite works. Because of my high regard for that book, I eagerly blazed through her dystopian novel, Delirium. There were several reasons why I was let down by that book, possibly mostly due to high expectations. It was much slower paced, possibly because it was spread into a trilogy, and I was not as invested in Lena (to me, she was almost too innocent and uncertain) and did not feel very attached to Alex, her love interest. I felt he was too straight of a character, without the many layers and depth that I was used to in Before I Fall.<br /><br />I bring this up in this review because the second novel in this trilogy, which so often ends up being the \\"filler\\" book in many trilogies, surpasses the first in all of these areas and more.<br /><br />Pandemonium picks up right where Delirium ends in the aftermath of Lena making it to the Wilds, with Alex presumably left behind and killed. This book is composed as a series of flashbacks of her life in the Wilds and her present time as an active part of the Resistance.<br /><br />This book again showcases Lauren Oliver's gorgeous prose. She writes so beautifully and poignantly in a way I have not seen matched currently. Furthermore, the pacing of this book is much better than the first. We are immediately thrust into the dangerous Wilds and the difficult life that Lena is now adapting. Lena has developed into a much more interesting character, with hardened edges from the terrible tragedies she has experienced and the difficult life she now leads. Then, we are introduced to Julian, the head of the Cured activist group. I immediately was drawn to him in ways that I was never with Alex. Instead of a straightforward protagonist, Julian is multifaceted; a character with depth, feeling, and emotion, who changes with experience and develops meaningful relationships.<br /><br />I also want to mention that while I was never surprised by any of the secrets revealed during this novel (and there are several), I welcomed all of them. I thought they were well thought out and necessary-- the exact right moves. When I was in my fiction writing class at Stanford, my teacher once told us to trap two very different characters in a place and just see what happens. I imagine that might have been exactly what happened for Julian and Lena.<br /><br />A gorgeous book, well written and another amazing success for Lauren Oliver. I was unsure if I would read the final book in this series, but now that doubt has completely fled. I eagerly await the thrilling conclusion to this trilogy, and know that Lauren Oliver has an amazing career ahead of her as one of the most promising YA authors to date.r surprised by any of the secrets revealed during this novel (and there are several), I welcomed all of them.

B005H5H3LW|1.0|Do you enjoy sitting through utterly ironic copyright warnings and long series of LONG unskippable previews for films that obviously you will not enjoy?  Congratulations then, you've found a good way to waste your money.  Or, you could just do what the makers of this DVD did and go on a peer-sharing network, download the excellent film \\"Space Battleship Yamato\\" and then burn it to a blank DVD.  That would save you 15 minutes of sitting though crap that the pirates who market this DVD think you NEED to watch.<br /><br />Again, no complaints about the film itself.  But don't buy this half-assed pirate version of the DVD.

0439023483|4.0|I did enjoy the book, but not as much as I was told I would.  This is my mistake as I try to avoid judgement on a book until I've personally read it, but I really went thinking I would love the book.  First of all, many of the criticism on the book is the similarity between Hunger Games and Battle Royale.  In my opinion, I think there is probably only a handful of people who ever read Battle Royale and would never have known about the book until the comparisons came out over the internet.  The similarities are there, but to accuse someone of blatant plagarism requires a bit more proof.  To me, Running Man first came to mind when I learned about the plot and The Lottery as far as the selecion of names.  Similar does not always mean stolen.<br /><br />Second, the book is an easy read, which I found great, because sometimes I am looking for something to be quick and entertaining.  Third, parents who ascert their smugness in reviews annoys me greatly.  Oh, the strong parental bonds, blah, blah, blah.  It is a book, get over it.  Also, maybe the age of the main characters also has something to do with her target audience...ever think of that?  I don't find the book as brutal as others have described and I was actually expecting worse.  Overall, I would recommend reading the book if you want a fun series.<br /><br />My complaints on the book stem from the lack of outside characters.  Other than Katniss, hardly anyone else has a personality.  This is especially true when it comes to the book villains who have the worst dialogue outside of a 80's comic book.  My second complaint is the mutant pups in the book as I found this to be incredibly stupid.  This amazing technology exists to essentially resurrect the dead but they can't heal a leg?
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|A little while ago I said that the only problem was that the app had a \\"hideous UI\\". I'm happy to say the developers have updated the software and not OfficeSuite Professional 6 is BEAUTIFUL!<br /><br />This app is the best word processor I've used on Android yet. I've also used Google Docs, Polaris Office, and Quick Office Pro. While all have strengths, OfficeSuite certainly takes the cake. Unlike Quick Office, OfficeSuite allows you to save in the newest format (such as .docx) and open files of that format. Additionally, it formats bullet points much better than Polaris Office or Google Docs for Android.  And now Office Suite has a UI that competes with the other big sellers.<br /><br />If you use your Android tablet for school notes, this app is a must-have!
0545425115|5.0|After being harped on for many weeks by my future daughter-in-law to read this series, I finally gave in.  And am I glad I did.  Read all three books in less than two days while on vacation.  Could not put them down.  Like Harry Potter, this series has moved from adolescent to adult quite nicely.  Read the trilogy, you will be glad you did.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. It is user friendly, and I love that it tells me the temp in my taskbar.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|There was some digital break up in the menu making it difficult to start the movie. Also certain parts of the movie skipped on this DVD. This is a great movie and even though it was past  the warranty return time, Amazon helped me purchase another one. They also made sure they got it to me fast.  I may have just gotten one bad DVD in the batch. Amazon is the best !
006197806X|5.0|Just like the first, I couldn't put this book down.  This book is set up where it shows what happened to Lena after escaping to the wild, and then about a year later as part of the resistence.  It alternates chapters of then and now.  It was done quite masterfully, and you got caught up in both stories.  the stories has plenty of surprises and you delve deeper into the world Lauren Oliver has created.  I don't want to give too much away, but after finishing it I did make the connection that it is following a pattern very much like the Twilight saga, hence the title for the review.  I'm going to read Hana next : )
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Amazing never a better choice. The quality was perfect. I would certainly purchase more. I thought I would have to return it because I didn't have blu-ray but it turned out I didn't.Very pleased.

0385534639|5.0|Either you ARE a reveur or you are NOT a reveur.  And THAT will determine whether you enjoy this book.  Reveurs still enjoy the mystery of the moon, we see art all around us, and we never quite stopped believing that magic is real. If this describes you, then you will fall in love with The Night Circus. It is a romantic examination of the universal idea of truth, the concept of reality, and the theme of freedom. Set at the turn of the century, the characters convincingly struggle with the choices they have to make.  Do they have free will?  Are they bound by others' choices?  The number of philosophical questions the book stimulates matches the number of tents to be explored each night in the Night Circus.  These days I rarely buy books.  However, this time Amazon will be happy because I HAVE to own a copy of this one.

0761169253|5.0|\\"Steal Like an Artist\\" provides practical advice, in a succinct and often witty style, to people who create things in this modern world (as Kleon points out, \\"that should describe all of us\\"). The tone isn't presumptuous or arrogant; it's written like he's talking to a friend. His insights are surrounded by quotes, illustrations, and several poems in the style of his newspaper cutouts, making the read all the more pleasant. \\"Steal Like an Artist\\" isn't a long book, and that's awesome. You can easily pick it up and read through a few chapters for a quick injection of inspriation.<br /><br />Also: I would highly recommend buying the print version; having this little square book in your hands, easily flippable and reachable on your desk, is worth spending an extra 44¢. You won't regret buying this handy little guide.

B0079KGAOY|5.0|Cannot believe it took Warner this long to release this collection on blu ray here in the states. I have had the region free blu ray from Amazon UK for a long time. Check it out, it may be cheaper than this \\"newer\\" set. From looking at the cover and the number of discs, it is the same set from UK. If it is, these are the theatrical cuts and not those 'directors cuts' people like. The scenes from those cuts are included on the discs. I enjoyed the this set very much. The picture and sound quality is amazing! Sad it took Warner this long to release this here in the states. By the way, Amazon has the aspect ratio wrong in their listing. The first movie is 1.85 and the other three are the correct Panavision 2.35 with all movies in glorious DTS-HD!! This set will knock your socks off!<br />Hope you get it from either here or the UK and re-appreciate these buddy-cop movies all over again.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|hands on one of the best games for kids out there today. my 3 years old daughter loves it! if you have kids, you must give it s try!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|If you are hoping, as I was, to see quite a lot of Brendan Coyle (Bates) and Hugh Bonneville (Lord Grantham) - you'll be a little disappointed at how slim the storyline is as regards those two. Series 2 develops previously established B-stories that I found less riveting. However, the tone of the series rapidly shifts focus from the rigid importance of reputation, good name, and tradition into Wartime Values, expediency, and rapid social change. I thought the first Season had more of a mystery and serialized drama flavor to it. Whereas this one has many more features in common with all-out soap opera given how quickly the conflicts pay off. Still, you can't miss it.<br /><br />The settings are beautiful, the costuming is gorgeous and if Maggie Smith were acting by herself, reciting lines to mannequins with their dialog read off stage, it would STILL be worth seeing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great Bible app. I love the audio feature and the Bible reading plans.  Each of my children have this Bible on their various mobile devices and we are all on a Bible reading plan.  My youngest reads it while listening to the audio because he is a new reader. The notes and highlighting features are very handy and easy to use.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun little app to help me relax. Great little time waster. Runs great on my android phone and android tablet.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I have every DVD and CD by this amazing group. I always expect the next one to be a disappointment because the cast changes and cannot understand how they could possibly be better. But they have done it again! The addition of the kids choir was outstanding. The addition of Lisa Lambe was another great surprise. Her rendition of \\"Black Is the Colour\\" and \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" was fantastic. I have also seen them in person three times and they never disappoint. I could go on but I think you get the picture. If you are a fan you will love this!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Freaking Great. It caught me completely off gaurd. I cant believe how funny this movie is. Congrads to the people who made this film.

0553805371|4.0|I bought the iBook version of this book, and I couldn't put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. After reading Brian Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe,\\" I found this book to be a good refresher. You do not need to feel like you are too stupid to read this book, it is meant to be understood by the uninformed reader. Hawking does a great job at describing the universe in a way that makes life seem so much more profound than the pedestrian way it so often appears.<br />I did not find myself wishing that certain topics would just \\"be done already.\\" He keeps things brief but not too brief, simple but not too simple. Hawking has done a tremendous service as he has brought physics to the home of lay reader, such as myself. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a brief introduction into the workings of the universe.
0553593544|5.0|If you want an action-packed thriller/suspense/spy novel, it never hurts to pick up a Ludlum book, almost any of them will quench your desire.  The Bourne Identity is one of his best--a wild ride that makes the reader catch their breath as the intrigue mounts and mounts.  Bourne is a likable and pitiable character, a man driven to do things he cannot understand but must continue repeating them to get at the ultimate truth of who he was and where he came from.  The action is paramount in this novel, and Bourne turns out to be one tough and capable character.<br />Ludlum was always supremely skilled at his craft, he creates a DENSE plot that gets more intricate as the novel progresses, but never flags for an instant and also does not confuse the reader.  I really cannot see Matt Damon as Jason Bourne after reading this, I am glad I read the novel before I made the attempt at the movie.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|Waste of money.  Shame because I like the otterbox for my iphone.  I doubt I'll go through the trouble to return it though, just going into the trash.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|By the time this DVD is released, there will be no space here for actual reviews of the product and its quality.  If I wanted movie reviews, the woods are full.  Amazon really should not open up this to reviews before ordinary customers have ordered, received and evaluated the product itself.  I strongly suspect many of these prerelease reviewers are industry touts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games, makes time go by very quickly. many games are fairly easy others take more time. some games don't give you lots of points.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I already dropped my phone 3 times during past 2 weeks. This cover saved my iphone4s. I cannot find any damage. The front of the phone is also well protected. This is not a clear plastic. A clear plastic cover tends to easily scratched and leaves white marks especially when it is dropped on a hard surface. NO cracks. No white marks on my cover. I'm glad that I went with this cover.
1609611543|2.0|The farther I get into this book, the more apparent it is that it is a crackpot screed. You will learn more, and much more that is sound, well documented, and useful, in Gary Taubes's books (I recommend both Good Calories, Bad Calories AND the overlapping Why We Get Fat). The one-star reviews here nail down the key peculiarities of Dr. Davis's book. I cannot say I outright \\"hate it,\\" but the most I can give it is two stars (don't like.) Yes, go easy on refined carbs. Taubes explains why. Dr. Davis goes off on an extremist tangent. IMHO.

B004OEMRGI|4.0|A beautiful, meditative album. Bombino's guitar and voice bring the songs forward with quiet insistence. This is not a guitar shredder's tour de force, but a soulful reflection of life and struggle, full of the rolling rhythms of West Africa. Bombino sings in Tamasheq, and there are no translations in the notes. Never mind. Listen with your heart and you will understand.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I think this is a good Bible app, however, it could be a GREAT Bible app if the \\"notes\\" section were available offline. When bookmarking and taking notes during church service, I cannot save them because I cannot connect to WiFi.
0307887898|5.0|This book was written for the rest of us who lack the type of vision Steve Jobs has.  It asks you to do the exact opposite of what Jobs has been doing all his life.  But then again, how many of us are like Jobs? Exactly, so the rest of us mortals should read and follow Eric's advice.<br /><br />For those of us steeped in the venture/entrepreneurial methodologies, Eric Ries is no stranger.  He's been writing on his blog for years and this book distills the essence of what he's written over the years into a single volume.  I believe this book  will benefit entrepreneurs of all levels because Eric tries to bring order and a formalized method to the startup process.  This process is the result of years experience in looking at what works.  It's empirical science at it's finest.<br /><br />After reading this book you can't help but say to yourself, \\"oh, this makes so much common sense.\\" However, Eric's lean method is the first time anyone has written a formalized plan for increasing the odds that your venture survives and thus, should be complemented for its insights.<br /><br />The crux of the plan is simple (simple doesn't always mean easy!).  Startups should always be in a validated learning mode.  That means that you should launch a minimally viable product (MVP) so that you don't waste time, money and effort at building something that perhaps no one wants.  The MVP allows you to gather feedback about certain ideas you hypothesize and test before committing and more importantly; it allows you to iterate your product towards building a sustainable business.  The key to this methodology is the build-measure-learn feedback loop.  It's the essence of what distinguishes those ventures that are successful at it and become the winners in the marketplace vs. those who are not, thus, eventually fail.<br /><br />I found the book to be a quick read taking a day or two to finish.  I think Ries could improve the book by giving more real life examples of different startups.  In the book he cited only a handful of examples.  It would be much more instructive if more case studies would have been presented.  I would think that since he's the entrepreneur in resident at HBS that he would have access to numerous case studies?<br /><br />The crux of the lean method can be summarized in the following five steps.<br /><br />1. Everything a startup does is an experiment<br />2. Build a \\"minimum viable product\\" (MVP)<br />3. Don't waste energy on \\"success theatre\\"<br />4. Focus on a \\"build, measure, learn\\" concept<br />5. Be able to \\"pivot\\" - change strategy, not vision<br /><br />Eric also incorporates many of the Japanese lean manufacturing methods, such as the Five Whys, into managing a startup process.  I think that's a great lesson in being able to connect the dots.<br /><br />Finally, Ries offers some tips on how to use these methods in a larger organization so that they too can benefit from the nimble nature of a startup.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked The Lean Startup. I think Eric Ries can continually revise this book to include more case studies and any changes in method that he discovers as time passes.  Startups are always evolving and a handbook that guides entrepreneurs on their difficult journey should always contain the most forward thinking on the subject at any time.e book he cited only a handful of examples.
