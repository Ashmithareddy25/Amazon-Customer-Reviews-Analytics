1878424319|4.0|I was on something of a spiritual quest when I came across don Miguel Ruiz's book at a local store.  I looked inside the front flap and found 4 very simple statements, the truth of which were obvious: 1. Be impeccable with your word. 2. Don't take anything personally. 3. Don't make assumptions. 4. Always do your best.<br />They resonated with me: I'd been trying to live my life by those four concepts for years, but had never seen them stated so succinctly.  They were so plain to me that I actually considered not buying the book.<br />I'm glad I did, though, because I now have the opportunity to share its ideas with others.<br />The greatest misfortune of this book is that it's not really written for those who already understand what it's driving at; its congenial second-person style can come off a bit high-handed and superior at times, sort of an &quot;I've discovered this but you haven't&quot; tone.  If you live by the second agreement, this isn't a particular problem, though.<br />But as nice a read as it is for those who understand its concepts, I have to wonder if the tone isn't a bit off-putting to those who have yet to overcome the stumbling blocks of their own negative agreements. I tell people to pick up the book and read the inside front flap--if the text there resonates with them and they feel they can gain something from this book, they will.  If the agreements read like gibberish, or they're attempted to dismiss the book out of hand as yet another handful of spiritual SRIs for the spiritually depressed, I recommend they steer clear from it.<br />There are things in this book that can sting those who are unprepared for the spiritual path beyond its gates. For those, I recommend Robert Fisher's THE KNIGHT IN RUSTY ARMOR as a gentler introduction to what is, after all, a difficult but truly satisfying road to travel.
B00006C79E|1.0|Saint Etienne has finally made an album that falls completely on its face.  I read dozens of reviews claiming that \\"Finisterre\\" is somewhat of a throwback to their early 90s, sample heavy techno-dance-soul-pop work. While I would agree with that, I would also state that \\"Finisterre\\" pales in comparison to just about anything they've ever done. I was an avid fan of their previous work, most notably their striking debut, \\"Fox Base Alpha,\\" and their glorious, organic \\"full-band\\" album \\"Good Humor.\\" \\"Finisterre\\" turned out to be quite a let down for me, and that wouldn't matter so much had I not been bombarded with the deluge of critical praise that accompanied its release.    \\"Action\\" merely sounds like a rehashing of that early to mid-90s runway euro-disco-trash sound, coming off like a self-parody of their lesser tunes of that era. Puzzlingly, this retro theme pops up in several songs. Saint Etienne has made a habit of keeping up with trends and giving them their own unique twist, but here they've got what seem like obligatory yet uninspired, early 80s techo-pop throwbacks with \\"Amateur\\" and \\"B92,\\" perhaps to placate those who've immersed themselves in today's obsession with new wave; nice analog synths, but the songs leave little to hold on to. There are also a few seriously rambling, pointless instrumentals, the worst offender being \\"Language Lab.\\" And the only really catchy melody on the whole album is in the obnoxious, cloying \\"Soft Like Me,\\" featuring some of the most cringe-inducing, cliché-ridden rapping imaginable (courtesy of female Brit-rapper Wildflower), sounding - alarmingly - quite like the Spice Girls (!).  The chorus, sung by Cracknell, is so annoyingly catchy that any laundry detergent company would be FOOLISH *not* to use this for a commercial jingle.  The remainder of the record is pretty forgettable. The title track is nice, but nothing extraordinary.    So, what we have here is a once-talented band running on empty, churning out an album full offorgettable fluff and filler. I hate to sound snobby, but maybe it's time to bid St. Etienne adieu.
B000001FFJ|5.0|This was really the first Tom Waits CD I ever bought and it's still my favorite in many way. It was practically the soundtrack to Jim Jarmusch'e 'Down By Law', which also starred Tom Waits. I like trhe tracks uniformly, though 'Cemetery polka&quot; kind of stays with you!
0316666343|1.0|-the premise is a good one-- a book narrated by someone recently passed over -too bad the writer isnt up to the task-   this book is contrived and manipulative --- all books manipulate the reader of course-- but brilliant books do it with a certain grace and believablity-- this is a prurient bunch of nonsense- with no real meat to it-- i hated it and couldnt even finish it- dont waste yer time-----
B00000I41J|5.0|This is simply my favorite jazz album.  Just buy it and listen to it over and over again.  You will not be sorry, I assure you.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|If the movies are to be believed, stupid people have insights into society that the rest of us just aren't privy to. Films such as DUMB &amp; DUMBER, DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?, BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD DO AMERICA, and the Bill &amp; Ted series show us people who are intellectually ill-equipped to deal with society, yet somehow, in their ignorance and naivete, end up on top of the heap.<br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) starts out on top of the heap: he's the most successful male model in America, but his career is on the wane, being quickly eclipsed by upstart model Hansel (Owen Wilson). When a tragic gasoline-fight accident kills Derek's three roommates, he decides the time has come to retire.<br />This leads directly into the film's over-the-top MANCHURIAN-CANDIDATE-style political assassination plot, but the real fun here is in the characters rather than the story.<br />As the story unfolds, characters who were sold to us as stupid turn out to have a certain savvy and a flair for living that transcends intelligence, which is really the message of all the films in this &quot;genre:&quot; ignorance is indeed bliss, and what's important is knowing that you have a place in the world even if you don't understand what it is.<br />Derek's triumph is strange and appropriate to the film, and we all get an opportunity to wonder why people are so quick to judge; just because you can't see or comprehend someone's finest talent, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<br />An enjoyable effort from Ben Stiller (who also directed), but certainly not for everyone--if, for you, stupid characters make for a stupid movie, this is one you should pass on. If you're interested in the keen insight into society that the eyes of those less intellectually-gifted can bring, this one stands tall in the chain of films that carry that message.  It's certainly no BEING THERE, but it's fun, and, if nothing else, it will make you think about not being able to think.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Mayer's laid back attitude feels just like that, an attitude, rather than a true reflection of a real character.  It's a deliberate album, pushing certain buttons we're likely to respond to, the ode to physical beauty, the high school angst, but Mayer moves to fast, trying to cover every county in the country of the young American man.  It's just not convincing.  There are some strong songs, notably 'Your Body is a Wonderland', but overall, this is the kind of non-offensive, hazy artist that a record company has decided to push at the public.  You'll hear little to suggest Mayer's going to be around for long.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is the first studio album Bruce has released since I have become a fan, and I am in no way disappointed.  People have been all to quick to both praise this album before hearing it as well as dismiss it because of the media attention surrounding it.  To anybody looking for good music and a sould-reaching experience, I have one suggestion for you:  Sit down, and listen to this album twice all the way through.  I'll admit some of the songs (Nothing Man, Let's Be Friends) are not in my favorites list.  But so many others--Lonesome Day, Into the Fire, Counting on a Miracle, Empty Sky, Mary's Place, and the title track are beautiful.  &quot;You're Missing&quot; is about the loss everybody feels at a point in their life, and &quot;Paradise&quot; is a classic Bruce song that will make you think about all people involved in a tragedy.  Although I am only 21, every theme on this album reaches me.  I will make no attempt to compare it to other Springsteen albums, but trust me, there isn't another one like it.
B00006M183|4.0|There has been plenty for Pearl Jam to write songs about since their 2000 release &quot;Binaural&quot;.  Commentary on the questionable Bush presidency, September 11, and losing 9 fans at a concert in Roskilde are all easily recognizable in Eddie Vedder's lyrics throughout &quot;Riot Act&quot;.  <br />However, what might be an anticipated downer of an album is actually infused with plenty of things to smile about.  Not only does the band share songwriting responsibilities once again, including a grinding guitar fest from drummer Matt Cameron called &quot;You Are&quot;,  but they've continued to expand their lineup, adding keyboards to some tracks from Vedder's island pal Boom Gaspar.<br />Perhaps more surprising is that while many of the 15 tracks feature heavy riffs reminscient of the start of 1994's &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, the lyrics somehow find a glimmer of hope amidst all of the turmoil that the band sees in their collective worlds.  Not only does the word &quot;love&quot; appear 20 times in the lyric booklet, but Vedder shows the wisdom that comes with age and rock and roll longevity with lines like &quot;No matter how cold the winter / there's a springtime ahead.&quot;  Perhaps in another 10 years we'll be hearing similar things from Staind or Creed.  I for one won't hold my breath.<br />One note: Republicans might wanna skip this album and buy the new Christina Aguilera instead.  Something tells me you'd be happier that way.
6305537321|5.0|This is one of the first movies with the wonderful Audrey Hepburn in it.  She acts as the rich girl, living like a movie star.  When a twist comes back to her life, she has to figure out how to hide her past and keep her front to protect her image.  She does a great job actind and singing the beautiful &quot;Moon River.&quot;  This movie melts my heart and makes me want to go and search for a cat in the rain :)
B00005JL95|5.0|Personally I loved this movie so much because it's very different from all the Disney stories I've watched since I was a little girl. It offers a contemporary look to issues like science and family values, so important for our society. Also like any of the main characters we can laugh and cry with them while watching the movie. Sincerely it's a beautiful movie full of good things to think about.
B00006IR5S|5.0|For all John Williams fans, this is another must on the list.  For Harry Potter fans, it's the icing on the cake. <br />John Williams has done it again.  Fans of the soundtrack for the first movie will be pleased, as many of the original themes are back.  But each of the themes have a new twist on them, a new...somewhat darker spin in the undertones.  But it is the new themes that make the soundtrack.  Fawkes' theme will haunt you for days with the beautiful arangement of the music, and the sound of a &quot;bird&quot;.  Lockhart's music is also well placed, sounding just like a frog with the brass. <br />Wonderfully done!
0440180295|4.0|\\"The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes.  But the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.\\"  This poem has great significance to Slaughterhouse-Five.  The main character in the book is Billy Pilgrim and the journeys and everything he experienced.  The poem has to do with Billy because when something bad happens in his life he does not cry over it, he just kind of has an acceptance of this horrifying event.  Billy can travel to the past and to the future in a blink of an eye.  That is why I believe that Billy has an understanding towards a tragic event.  He is able to see the bad events in his life before it really happens to him.  Therefore he knows it will happen and there is nothing he can do about it accept to accept it and move on.  Billy can travel from World War II to when he is an optometrist in 1967.  He travels to the past and future many times throughout the book, when he was a child, when he was in the war, or after the war. He has also seen his death many times.<BR> Kurt Vonnegut, JR. creates this alien world where Billy is transported after he gets kidnapped by the aliens.  This world was called Tralfadore.  I believe that this world that Kurt Vonnegut, JR. creates is a replica of Billy's mind.  I believe this because the people on Tralfadore have a great acceptance towards events that happened.  The only concept Billy doesn't have is that everything and every event was structured to be and you cannot change that.<BR> I believe that Slaughterhouse-Five is a great book and it states its moral well.  I would recommend this book to people who want to learn good and interesting concepts and lessons in life.
B00005YXZH|4.0|\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is like nothing else in the Wilco catalog to date, which doesn't bother me because I'm not much of a fan of the rest of their work. What I like about this album is its attempt to delve into the world of art rock. (Indeed, their previous record label turned down the record for its experimental edge, which wasn't thought to be commercial enough.) I applaud Wilco for trying to bring something different to a large audience in this day and age. They do this with a variety of computer effects, jangling pianos, and background noises that weave in and out of some of the songs. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. The opening track, \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" flaunts its sounds overmuch during a rather slight song that goes on too long, instead of concisely and seamlessly integrating them the way the Beatles used to do. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to hear some different sounds now and then over the usual rock band stuff. Even a slightly unusual tweak in the mixing, such as the lush, pronounced guitar sound that is featured in \\"I'm the Man Who loves You,\\" is a breath of fresh air. I could have used fewer fuzzy distorted sounds, which aren't that rare these days, and a few more rich backing tracks, without such a thin underlying sound (acoustic guitars, drums, ho hum. How about some organs or flutes or something...?) Fans of this album will also want to check out the work of a band called Shivaree, who mix a variety of sounds in the backgrounds of their songs too.
B00003CWTI|3.0|I saw \\"Magnolia\\" in the theatre in January, 2000. While I wasn't wetting my pants over the film as many critics were, I liked it enough to buy the DVD later that summer. Now that I've given it a recent viewing, I've concluded that \\"Magnolia\\" ranks up there with \\"Doctor Zhivago,\\" \\"The Piano,\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" as one of the most overrated films to hit the silver screen. There's as much to admire as there is to pick at, and while \\"Magnolia\\" has great performances and a promising premise, it's a strange step backward for the director who gave us the vastly superior \\"Boogie Nights.\\" To summarize, 11 people in southern California are somehow united through circumstance, tragedy, or bloodlines. None of the characters are very likeable, and a handful of them are so stupid or immersed in their own angst, you pray they get hit by a lightening bolt to put them out of their misery. The Black characters, all background roles, offer little more than crass stereotypes: the fat and boisterous ghetto woman, the preteen pickpocketing \\"rapper,\\" and the timid journalist who gets disrespected by a smug, self-help guru (Tom Cruise). Some scenes require you to suspend disbelief to digest fully. How that cop (Reilly) was able to befriend and romance that train wreck of a drug addict without so much as suspecting her condition is beyond me, and for that reason, that subplot failed. And while Paul Thomas Anderson is a gifted and articulate screenwriter, he must have skipped the class in film school that taught dramatic subtlety. The score, while lush and beautiful, gets overempowering for a huge portion of the movie as it tries to underscore the film's dramatic tension. Completely unnecessary. Hitchcock will tell you that less is often more. And the film's bizarre final scene, which aimed to \\"tie up everything together,\\" was unacceptable and showed that Anderson failed to come up with a way to coherently end the film. And the length? I've seen three hour movies that dragged at a worse pace, but a film like \\"Magnolia\\" could have been trimmed by at least one hour.<br />You'd think that by reading the above, I would despise \\"Magnolia.\\" Quite the contrary. While there are good performances and intriguing moments, I don't think it deserves to be put on such a high pedestal. For that reason, its considerable warts earn the film a mere B- in my school of cinema.ut a film like \\"Magnolia\\" could have been trimmed by at least one hour. <br />You'd think that by reading the above, I would despise \\"Magnolia.\\" Quite the contrary.

B000069AT7|4.0|This is not so much a review of the movie as of the collector's package. It's a great package - the original version of the movie (the actual original version, unlike Disney's recolored and reanimated &quot;original&quot; Beauty &amp; The Beast), the 2002 version, a disc of extras and a disc with the soundtrack, a hardcover book, a Senitype (an actual frame of 35mm film reproduced by &quot;masters&quot; as well as a developed enlargement on the same card, individually numbered) and a certificate of authenticity. The only problem with this set is the Senitype says in the information on the back of it that it only comes with the 2 disc limited collector's edition. I bought the 2 disc limited collector's edition in addition to this package and the 2 disc version does not come with a Senitype. They obviously switched ideas midstream, but it should have been corrected.<br />Other than that it is a great package for fans of the movie, old or new.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips are without a doubt one of the most significant bands of the 90's.  As if they're previous effort \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" wasn't enough, they've returned with a more cohesive and wistful effort.<br />While \\"Bulletin\\" was vast, orchestral, and beautiful, \\"Yoshimi\\" is more electronic and measured.  Lyrically, the album is very thought-provoking...weaving tales of emotional robots, death, and struggle.  I listen to it constantly, and take inspiration from it's effortless beauty.  <br />The bass lines on this album are unreal...funky, beautiful, and melodic.  Memorable choruses and interesting chord structures make this one of the year's best.  Buy it...Buy it...buy it!...NOW!
B00006LLLN|5.0|This live cd set is an amazing compilation of Alison Krauss's amazing talents as a singer and fiddle player, and the talents of her band members Dan, Ron, Barry and Jerry.  Great work AKUS!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Based on William Steig's bizzare backwards fairy tale, DreamWork's SHREK has fantastic animation, great voice casting and infamous \\"irreverent\\" humor. An ogre and a donkey rescuing a princess for an under-endowed King. How cleverly post-modern. Ha and indeed ha. Yes, it's a worldwide cartoon phenomenon or something like that. Now don't get me wrong, I like the recent movies like this one that trade traditional cute jokes for movie lampooning and irreverent gags, but I find it hard to avoid the fact that this \\"hilarious\\" comedy is somewhat overrated. Shrek (Mike Myers) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are a good odd-couple and there are some great jabs at Disney throughout the film's running time. But fart gags and weird humor aside, it's not as clever as it thinks it is. There are some fantastically funny moments in the film, especially the gingerbread man sequence and lines like \\"In the morning, i'm making waffles!\\" And the escape from the dragon's castle is a tour-de-force of fantastic animation and strange gags. However it's far more funnier if you take it as the sum of its parts rather than the movie as a whole. It may sound like just knocking success, but if you actually sit back and watch it, well, it really depends on if you want to sit through a cartoon with gross-out humour and fart gags. From a technical standpoint, the CGI photo-realistic water and fur simulation is brilliant. Since the success of TOY STORY, computer-generated cartoons have come a long way and it's impossible to deny that the CG is impressive. But then, so was the CG in Godzilla (Lesson: Impressive effects do not a good movie make). Watching SHREK in comparison to Pixar's competition MONSTERS INC, the latter is a more clever premise. Shrek gets 5 stars for animation, but it's a 3 star movie for laughs. the DVD extras are impressive though, with Commentaries, mock interviews, 'making of' docos and trailers.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Categorically until the Moulin Rouge effort, I disregarded Ms Aguilera.  Then I heard Dirrty.  Wow.  Wot a song and wot a video.  I thought ''oooh, Ms Aguilera's become a teen tramp''.  Not a nice opinion mayb, but I loved the song and feared tho that her fans would forsake her.  I did not expect what I heard ont he cd.  Dirrty is the only real raunchy track on the album, yet the remainder of this album, most of which has been co-penned by Christina, along with well-known writers and producers displays a more mature edge to Christina and her life.  Exposing some autobiographical experiences along the way and indulging in an eclectic catalogue of diversely satisfying musical styles, Christina's passion and sensational voice shine through unbelievably.  I cannot emphasise this enough and I am not an original Christina fan!! My personal faves are the first single dirrty (her talent is amazing in that video also) a Whitney type track called Get Mine. Get Yours, which is as smooth as chocolate &amp; could get to No1, a beautifully haunting ballad called Beautiful and I'm OK which is torturously performed.  Not one bad track on this album. Original, captivating and brimming with texture and quality, Ms Aguilera has come up trumps and in my estimation has laid down her mark as an artiste who has the savvy and talent to become enduring and with a voice that would put Celine Dion to shame.  You could do a lot worse with your money........
0688101364|5.0|This is such a wonderful book that someone borrowed mine and never returned it so I have to order a new one! I completely agree with the other reviewers about the great results you can achieve with this book. I suggest that those who were unsatisfied with their cookies make sure that they use exactly the specified ingredients, follow the instructions to the letter, check their oven temp and make any needed adjustments for altitude. I have never had a failure using this book. Mine disappeared before the binding could fail so I can't comment on that issue.  I also love Rose's Pie and Pastry Bible.
B000002B7S|5.0|I actually found the album locked away in a chest in the attic but I listened to it and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it. I was not into Ozzy Osborne in the beginning but I liked the track Bark at the Moon and Rock n'Roll Rebel and after listening to it ten times in a row, I found myself enjoying every track on the cd. It's definitely worth the money and it's recommended if you've never listen to Osborne before.
0441172717|5.0|I saw the movie 'Dune' as a kid. About the only things I remembered from the movie was the worms, the blue eyes, and Sting. Being a science fiction fan and wanting to form my own opinion of Herbert's story, I decided to read the book not too long ago. 'Dune' is a story, set in the distant future, about the battle for a planet and it's precious spice. It is full of adventure and fantasy.<br />'Dune' holds your attention throughout, and leaves you wanting more at the end {Herbert satisfies this craving with more Dune books). My only criticism is a slight one - there seems to be too many characters, plotlines, etc. going on at once in a couple of places - hard to keep track of it all occasionally.<br />I would greatly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction novels.
B00005Y228|4.0|This pop siren just gets bigger and bigger - her xplosion on the US scene with perhaps one of pop's greatest melodies, Can't Get You Out of My Head reminds audiences in the US what they have been missing.  Although not a patch on the pop catalogue of 2000's Light Years album, Fever maintains classy up-to-date electro pop, all done with Kylie's enigmatic twist.  Top trax are the first single, Love At First Sight, which has a fantastic underlying musical refrain, the sexually enticing Come Into My World (my fave on the album), Burning Up, which is a club classik and the uber-camp Dancefloor, where Kylie, (undoubtedly in hotpants) dances her ass off to get over her man!  Additional trax, Butterfly (one of the best songs from Light Years) and the sultry Boy (only on the UK single of Can't Get You) make this an incredibly good quality package in terms of the volume of tracks and the listenable quality to each one.  Perhaps one weak track, which is Fever itself - not v good @ all, but you can forgive her.  She's up there with Madonna & Janet as one of the world's leading performers.  This cd, which is still selling bucketloads over a year later, gives you a small understanding as to why this diminutive pop siren is so big and revered.......
0316776963|3.0|I'd heard a lot of good things about Sedaris. As a humor columnist myself, I thought I could learn a thing or two from the guy. And I did, but only by learning from his mistakes. I'm sure it was funny to a lot of people, but as a straight male, I had a hard time relating to his experiences. There were definitely moments where I laughed, but his attempts at being personal were lost on me.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This was a great movie. I have a son who is five and my husband and I had a great time watching this movie with him.  My son loved the characters and there were lots of funny parts for Mom &amp; Dad as well.  My son constantly asks to watch this movie.  We had a fun family night with this flick and highly recommend it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|After listening to this album quite obsessively for the past couple weeks, I've decided one thing. It combines the greatest elements of &quot;Angels of the Universe&quot; with the emotional crescendos of &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;. The first four songs convey a beautiful, &quot;I'm in love!&quot; state. These songs emotionally peak with track four. Next, a 30-second pause, then the second half. This half feels like a cold, lonely, rainy fall day. The peak of this is the (literally) breathtaking Track 8. If you want to hear the music of the gods, buy this CD.
B00005QXDD|5.0|great music mixing. anyone can listen to this and enjoy.<br />it has every style with smart witty lyrics. and boy is it funny. check it out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00006M183|5.0|We never can take as comparison reference the TEN when pearl jam shows a new album. Riot act is a much better than yield and binaural in several times. The ballads and punk had returned with true intensity. Bushleaguer, Cropduster, I am mine, Love Boat Captain demonstrates this.  Buy Now!
B00006NSGX|3.0|As a long-time fan of Clapton, I was pleasantly surprised that this effort meets my expectations. The output comprises excellent musicianship, and a loose feel. While not quite smokey blues, it has some funky, inspired moments. It's enhanced by the occasional fluffed note from Clapton -- he's taking a few chances, even in no one else is.<br />Highlights include a lively acoustic Key To The Highway, a joyful My Father's Eyes, a blustering River Of Tears and a manic She's Gone. Even tired favourites like Wonderful Tonight have a new twist. The multi-soloist HYELAW is another refreshing change from the plain blues-rock version. <br />The sound is first class, but on hearing the CD several times I've realised there are some serious flaws too.<br />1. The band is too slick, and lacks any \\"teen spirit\\". Granted Clapton is not a spring chicken, but the energy and passion of younger bands is sorely lacking, especially in the back up musicians. It would be better to have younger players with some spark rather than technically perfect oldies. His band add nothing, which probably explains why the best tracks like Key To The Highway, She's Gone feature EC more prominently.<br />2. There's a commercial over-reliance on standards such as Sunshine of Your Love and Cocaine. I have just heard them too many times, and it gets boring for long-time fans. More from Reptile or Pilgrim would have been appreciated. Or classic but forgotten tracks like Tales of Brave Ulysees, WDLGTBSS, Easy Now, The Core, Keep on Growin' etc etc (there are so many).<br />This may not be an album for those looking for non-stop guitar fireworks, but Clapton's guitar pyrotechnics always worked better for being spare. (Cream fans should listen again to the dreary Live Cream 2 before they react!). Fans of Unplugged Clapton should love this too. Dedicated fans probably have too much of this already.<br />Nevertheless, his best official live recording since the 70s.
0679882820|4.0|My daughter enjoys this book each time we read it to her.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I got this thinking it would be full of behind the scene content.  The movie is great, minus showing how he created his final costume. But the other DVD is just a waste of time.  I would have like to have heard what the actors were saying in the clothing test scenes.  Also needed more behind the scene stuff. Very laking of anything beyond the movie.
0871137380|5.0|This account of the failed mission in Somalia is so riveting that you may even think it is a fiction.  The view into the courage and determination of our Special Forces is simply amazing.  This is a story that is still misunderstood today and should be read by everyone old enough to remember the tragic incident.  The movie- based on the book- is quite exceptional as well, but nothing beats the narrative of what happened there and Mark Bowden does a tremendous job.<br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys or is fascinated by our military history.  It is gripping, revealing, and an utterly fantastic read.  Once you start reading it you will be hard-pressed to put it down.
6302765536|4.0|Home Alone 2 has almost the exact storyline plot of the first movie. The differences are that he is left behind at a different location and goes even further from his family. Other then that, the plot is the same (even the fear of having to sleep with cola-guzzling, bed-wetting Fuller!), but at least Kevin knows what do do in certain situations. Nevertheless, the film keeps you laughing, especially Criminal War II! By the way, the injuries suffered by Harry and Marv this time around would no doubt be fatal.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam's most recent effort \\"Riot Act\\" continues to show why the boys from Seattle are truly one of the greatest bands of all-time.  Pearl Jam has demonstrated its lizard like transformation over the past ten years by continually reinventing themselves.<BR> Most casual fans of Pearl Jam think back to the early 90's when the band was considered by many to a be a grunge band similar to Nirvana (although true fans of the band will argue that Pearl Jam has always been a pure rock band and never grunge).  It is true that the albums \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\" certainly have the aura of being in the grunge category.<BR> However with the death of Kurt Kobain in 1994, the grunge scene began to rapidly die off.  Pearl Jam realized this well in advance and following their third album \\"Vitalogy,\\" they made an almost unprecedented transformation.<BR> Their fourth album \\"No Code\\" truly showed the true array of talent that exists within this group.  Soft and almost hypnotic ballads intertwined with the classic hard rock made for an incredible record.  The same can be said for \\"Yield\\" and \\"Binaural.\\"  Pearl Jam had shown its ability to adapt over time.<BR> The 7th album \\"Riot Act\\" continues to show the personality of the new Pearl Jam.  Some of the lyrics are clearly post September 11th, such as in \\"Love Boat Captain\\" or \\"I Am Mine.\\"  Ed Vedder and the boys truly have a wonderful album that has a nice variety of soft and hard rock.  This is an album that proves Pearl Jam is capable of sustaining themselves through the test of time.  There is no arguing that this might be the best band in the last two decades.
B00006M183|4.0|I've never balked at any musician who follow their hearts.  Pearl Jam's progression and direction may not please everyone and their later releases may not have the angst and aggression of &quot;10&quot;, but people grow and Eddie and company have matured into brilliant (at times understated), craftsmen.  I applaud the organic nature of their new work.  It is reminiscent of the rock and roll roots they sprung from (Neil Young, The Band, et al.) You can FEEL these guys and you KNOW they can play the hell out of their instruments...a breath of fresh air.
B00006NSGX|3.0|I was eagerly anticipating this new 2 cd live set from Eric Clapton. This 2 disk set contains 19 songs from his 2001 tour (the DVD version contains 1 extra song).  When I noticed his backing band contained such capable musicians as drummer Steve Gadd, and keyboardists Billy Preston and David Sancious I expected a great set.  Perhaps since Clapton is such a fine musician my expectations exceeded the results. However this set is the weakest live recording he has released.  The majority of the first disk he plays acoustic guitar albeit expertly probably in an effort to help duplicate the success of his &quot;Unplugged&quot; disk.  The best acoustic cut and probably the best cut on the set is the version of &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot;.  The problem with the set is that Clapton seems to have adapted the stance of one of his heroes J.J. Cale.  The set is too laid back!  The songs seem for the most part uninspired.  The older songs have been played countless times and already exist in better live versions.  The majority of the newer songs especially those from his &quot;Pilgrim&quot; disk are just plain weak.  Songs such as &quot;Badge&quot; contain truncated guitar solos in favor of annoying synthesizer noodling.  The least he could have done was include a piano or B-3 organ solo instead those annoying synthesizers. The disks are about an hour each so more songs could have been included on the set.  In addition, the set would have been more interesting if Clapton included some older rarely played numbers or some blues covers not included on his previous albums.  If you compare this set to the &quot;Crossroads 2&quot; set Clapton's solos in songs such as &quot;Badge&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Loved A Woman&quot;, or &quot;Driftin' Blues&quot; from that set beat anything on this set hands down! Hopefully Clapton will return to his blues roots for his next set, until then this set is for diehards only.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell's generation loved the outdoors, embraced the civil rights movement and rejected the White House orchestration of the Vietnam War.  During this era some young radical Americans \\"dropped out\\" of society to bitterly protest a government's obsession with the Cold War and indifference to poverty.  However, most young Americans continued to function and were seduced by Joni Mitchell's penetrating but simplistic prose.  \\"Blue\\" is by far Joni's finest hour and to this day it can still strike a chord deep within me as it did over thirty years ago.  The late 60's and early 70's represented turmoil for many young Americans.  To that end, we are all thankful for Joni Mitchell's ability to sooth the soul and regenerate the spirit.
B00006AFUR|5.0|When I first heard the name 30 Seconds to Mars I didn't have a clue what it was. I first listened to Capricorn from a friend of mine and I was hooked.

Whoever buys this CD will certainally get their money's worth of great music
0345404475|4.0|The Science Fiction novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" by Philip K. Dick tells the story of Rick Deckart, a bounty hunter from San Fransisco in the year of 1992, which is in the future. His job is to \\"retire\\", means kill, humanoid robots who have escaped from their masters.<br />One of the main aspects the novel points out is the definition of life and therefore the evaluation of human and artificial life. In order to maintain the tension, the author purposly adds either human characteristics to the behavior of androids or the other way around. This keeps the reader guessing about the real identity of the persons in the novel (human or android?) and questions the low value of artificial life.<br />Empathy plays an important role in the topic. This so-called human characteristic is the key to distinguish androids from humans and makes it possible for the bounty hunters to detect androids. But in the course of the novel it becomes more and more clear to the reader that there is a lot more to genuine life than empathy.<br />Another aspect in the novel is the animal cult. Because of the harming dust, which has lead to the decrease and even extinction of animal species, animals have become a status symbol in society. As the example of androids, there are also artificial animals, which resemble the genuine animals astonishly. This aspect has the function of mirroring the situation between humans and androids.<br />Philip K. Dick has risen a very topical question, even though he wrote the book in 1968. Genetic engineering has become an important question that keeps us questioning about the definition and value of the life.<br />The story of the novel is very interesting and once you start reading, it is hard to put it away. What I personally disliked was the end of the novel. It was very confusing and did not reach me at all. For me, the story ended abruptly did not seem as precisly structured as it was in the rest of the book. Still, I would definitely recommend reading the book instead of watching the movie \\"Blade Runner\\".the book instead of watching the movie \\"Blade Runner\\".
6304806426|4.0|I just want to make a comment on the picture quality of the DVD as the 5/5 picture quality rating is misleading. I watched it in a theatre and was impressed with the quality of the film in every aspect. <br />The DVD is in widescreen letterbox format -- standard 4:3 screen with top and bottom chopped off to achieve 16:9. The resolution and details really suffer compared with anamorphic DVDs (a good reference is The Fifth Element, superbit version). The picture noise and artifacts are apparent through out the scenes, especially if you watch it on a big screen HDTV, though overall color reproduction is close to the film. The DD 5.1 sound is excellent -- I'd rather watch the DVD with my eyes closed, as the resolution of my mind is almost infinite (though not very accurate. The original theatrical experience helped :) <br />This film deserves a DVD re-release with better picture encoding/compression, which I hear is coming &quot;Real Soon Now&quot;.

0553260111|3.0|I am not a fan of the spy genre. This is the first book I picked up after watching the Matt Damon movie where he played Jason Bourne. I thought it was wonderful and since books are usually better than the movies, I thought the book would be even better. <br />It turned out I was wrong because while the plot was pretty good, Ludlum cannot write for nuts. Seriously, I wince when I read the dialogue. Characters have no chemistry between them. I cannot feel Bourne's anguish because the writing is so technical. I felt that throughout the novel, rather than having an atmosphere of despair as Ludlum wanted to convey, all i got was he throwing it in my face that yes, poor bourne, poor thing. <br />This book gets a 3 stars for the nice action and plot. If you can ignore the poor writing, it does make for a rather good read especially at the end. Oh and i don't plan to read the next 2 books.
B00006HBUB|1.0|This is an unwatchable big-budget attempt to cash in on a \\"classic\\" TV show. Yes, it's got big budget over-the-top effects and sets. Actually, I was surprised they didn't throw in a few more recognizable \\"B\\" actors (besides Buffy) to up the hype factor.<br />The plot and pacing drove me to get up and leave the room with the movie running due to boredom. The characters were all unlikable, with the possible exception of Shaggy and the Scooby CGI. The burping and farting contest not withstanding.<br />The attempts at \\"clever\\" adult jokes (pot smoke? etc) directed at the adults stuck watching this abomination were merely reminders that it is possible to make movies for kids that appeal to adults as well.<br />Usually movies this mindless are teen sex or slasher flicks that at least have nudity or gratuitous violence to keep the attention.<br />(..)Avoid at all costs!
0553277472|5.0|I finally read 'Zen', one of those books that nags at you for years before you've even read it. Every copy I've ever run across is dog-eared, warped from water and tinged brown from time and the smoke from fire places and camp fires. Here is my take: Pirsig's entire \\"inquiry into value\\" (a subject which he seems to take too far, and no wonder he goes a bit nutty trying to subdivide and take the subject to its logical end, when there is no logical end, because it is largely subjective in my opinion)was less important to me than his stark look at his own weaknesses and eventual madness, which he recovers from by being, at least in part, a different person. That he does this gradually, teasing us with glimpses through the looking glass to the thoughts and doings of 'Phaedrus', is gripping. I empathized with Pirsig's railings against the system, although his intellecutal arrogance perhaps stopped me short of complete sympathy. But I really admired him for facing himself this way - it is harrowing and kind of beautiful - and his realization in the end, when for a crucial moment he gets out of his head and sees what has been before him the whole time - really gave me the shivers. This human oddyssey, of a man too intelligent for his own good, is what I think makes 'Zen' an extraordinary, special book that stands on its own and will for many decades to come.

Just like me after purchasing it, you won't be able to not listen to it over and over and over. It fills my living space with good vibrations. One of the first CDs/albums I've ever owned that I just keep playing. To think Norah wrote and plays keyboards on several tracks is even more reason to let one's self partake of this wondrous musical adventure. I've played it so often since buying it my cats are bored and want to go out side, hahaha! Do buy it, relax and let Norah's spell be cast over you, your living space and your life! And think she's ONLY 22, so many years left, so much pure and innocent talk!!!!!! Go girl!

B00005QG9J|5.0|I'm fairly new to Incubus, so this would have to be their best in my opinion. Their music is very relaxing and monotone, as Brandon Boyd spews random thoughts that come from his mind. Nice To Know You, Warning, Mexico,and my favorite Wish You Were Here(no,not the Pink Floyd song)are among this great collage of this intellectually stimulating album.
B00006M183|5.0|I think this is my favorite PJ album next to Yield.<br />... If anything, this is PJ's most worldly album yet -- I could tell that they weren't thinking about themselves when recording it.<br />I like the wide variety of songs here.  It goes straight from the rocked-out Save You to the organ-driven Love Boat Captain, probably my favorite track on the album.  I also love Matt Cameron's contributions, especially Get Right and You Are.  It is a little strange to me to hear I Am Mine on this album, simply because I have been hearing a version of this song all the time since the 2001 Bridge School Benefit, and most recently since they released the single, so it is not really 'new' to me like the rest of the album.  Speaking of the single, I can definitely see why they didn't put Down or Undone on this album.  Although I love both songs very much, I really don't think they fit with the mood of the other 15 songs here.<br />This album sees the 5 members of Pearl Jam collaborating better than ever.  From the tense opening drums and chords of Can't Keep to the solemn ending of All or None, there is never a dull moment.  I recomment this to ANYONE without reservation.
B00003CXXS|3.0|An attempt to continue one of the most original film-series of all time.with an iffy beginning, the movie never gets much better. however there are some great special effects (of course) and some quite admorable actors. but in all its a science project that had no spine, a bad mix of storylines, a lack of the jurassic park engineer in steven speilberg, and coaded with  some named actors that had no material to work with all in a sour broth of humanitairian ideals. it goes off-track from the series and being a lover of the first film, i was utterly disapointed with its 3rd counterpart. 3 out of 5 which was generous.

0517123207|5.0|Although a lot has been learned since Darwin's time, and a lot of good books have been written, it's still useful to go back and read the book that started it all.  Darwin's text is clear and readable; and, since he was writing for people who'd never heard the idea before, he starts from first principles, as some modern writers don't.
B00006IR5S|5.0|If you liked the first soundtrack you'll love this one even better.  This has a wide aray of qualities in itself.  From light airy fun songs to the deep dark tunes in the story. By listening to this soundtrack it shows the story to music.  Just listen to it and you'll understand.
0553801481|4.0|Fool's Errand begins a new trilogy from acclaimed fantasy novelist Robin Hobb. It is not required to read the previous trilogy, but it does make the experience richer. All important past events are mentioned a few times, so I kept up although I hadn't read the first series for several years now. There are great tie-ins with both her other trilogies, so if you have read her other books, you will really enjoy this one.<br />I wasn't able to relate as much to this older, more mature character as I was to the characters in the Liveship Traders trilogy. I suspect this is because I am a young female and this book's main character is a middle-aged, experienced man. However, this very reason may make the book appealing to older readers, as so many fantasy novels focus on a youthful hero.<br />Robin Hobb's matured writing style is reflected in the matured characters and broader range of human emotions. This is a complex book character-wise, although the story is easy to follow.<br />As with all of Hobb's series, this one starts slow, allowing us to know our main characters before thrusting them into the action. However, it is never dull as so many introductions can be. Words and events are used judiciously.<br />I liked the underlying premise of this particular book, which seemed to be that beasts can be more noble than humans. This is shown both in the character of Nighteyes, Tom's wolf companion, and his distaste for unnecessary killing, as well as in the villain's disregard for the well-being of animals. I cannot say much more without giving away the plot, which has many surprises. These surprises are well set up in the beginning of the book, without giving away what they are. That kind of foreshadowing takes talent.

B00005JL96|5.0|I went to see Lilo & Stitch expecting a cutesy movie about a spunky Hawaiian child and her alien pal.  It turned out to be a  touching story about what it means to be family.  It takes the fanciful story of an alien coming to Earth and uses it to discuss death in a family, children acting out, the struggle of low income families to stay together, and love.  <br />I sincerely hope Disney continues to help children peek into other cultures in this way.  A child from the inner city of New York can identify with the messages in this movie while learning about an entirely different culture.  It is literally doing us a \\"world\\" of good.  I will definitely purchase this movie.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The best person to see this movie is someone who wants to read the book but hasn't yet.<br />Obviously a movie that's not 8 hours long never lives up to its book, but the parts they did use were done quite well enough that I don't regret paying seven bucks to see it in the theater.<br />One of the best integrations of CGI I've ever experienced; of course the fact that the movie is a coloring book of a kid's fantasy tale kinda makes that easier.  Just the same...<br />If you're 22 like me, give or take a few years, and you loved Legend and The Dark Crystal and The Labyrinth and The Princess Bride and The Neverending Story, pretend you're a kid with a new VCR and you're momma or daddy just rented this for you.  It's sure to be a classic in the same vein as those mentioned to the kids who are seeing it now!!

He has three new assistants which are nuns in disguise. Mary Tyler Moore is one of them, and she soon falls for the doctor. Elvis' character is stunned when she reaveals herself. At the end of the film, she is deciding who to go with: the church or the doctor, the church or the doctor. It keeps flashing on-screen: a crucifix, Elvis, a statue of Mary, Elvis.

B00006M183|5.0|It seems with each new album that Pearl Jam release, they deliver something different to anything that they have done before.

This album is a must have for any Pearl Jam fan.
6305827079|5.0|\\"Elvis: That's The Way It Is (Special Edition)\\" was a hit in January 2001 when it aired on TCM. I love this documentary. On TCM it read: \\"In November 1970 Denis Sanders directed the documentary 'Elvis: That's The Way It Is.' It chronicled Elvis as he returned to live performances after making movies in Hollywood during the '60s. Most of the footage shot was unused in the final film and remained lost in studio vaults. Until Now. \\" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer rediscovered over four hours of lost footage showing Elvis rehearsing and new concert footage and compiled most of it in here. This is truly something for evrybody to see. Don't try to pass this one up. As shown, the show is a complete sell-out and the seats in the showroom are packed. Elvis in concert in August 1970 at the International Hotel in Vegas in one megashow. That's the way it was!

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is one of the greatest films of all time.  Although it appears to be a children's movie, the humor has been directed at all age groups and maturity levels.  My family loved it so much, that we've passed it on to even my grandmother!  The simple jokes and allusions (especially to Lord Farquad's height) are creative and sly.  Although Shrek (Mike Meyers) does a fabulous job in this film, I would have to say that Eddie Murphy (Donkey) steals the show with his witty commentary and wisecracks.  You must see Shrek, whether you are a kid or an adult.  Don't be ashamed to rent it...the guy behind the counter will understand.
B00006CJOY|1.0|I love Manu Chao, but this live CD is not worth your money. <BR>From the first track, the listener is bombarded with familiar manu tracks set to a constant backbeat of hey! hey! hey! hey! ad nauseam. Nearly every song features that repetitive background vocal, and, while initially the album strikes one as energetic, upbeat, and fresh, it quickly becomes stale about halfway through the twenty-plus tracks, burying itself in its own droning, repetitive vibes. <BR>Energy in a live performance isn't created just by making your audience jump up and down to a &quot;hey!&quot; beat. <BR>Two hours of this amid a sweaty audience and too much beer in your system might work, but on a CD, it translates to music that annoys. <BR>Stay away.
B00006M183|5.0|With the release of Riot Act, Pearl Jam is showing the public where they are coming from, and where they are going, with their music. Unlike previous PJ efforts, namely Binaural and Yield, this record solidly rocks from the beginning to end, with the only slow down being in the thinly veiled Anti-Bush rant Bushleaguer.<br />Stand out tracks here are Save You, with Eddie throwing down more expletives in one song than their other 6 studio albums combined, Thumbing My Way, and 1/2 Full. As I said though, the only weak track is the spoken-word Bushleaguer, which is a poor man's &quot;I'm Open&quot; from No Code, so there is no need to skip tracks on this disc.<br />Though not as sonically explorative as Binaural, there is a raw quality to both the vocals and instruments that add a different flavor to the PJ catalog, giving the whole disc the garage-rock feel of Binaural's &quot;Grievance.&quot;<br />Overall, a fantastic disc that, despite its lack of \\"classic\\" Pearl Jam anthems, still hits on most every track and keeps you enthralled for all 54 minutes.
B000002U82|5.0|I purchased this album felling fairly doubtful about how good it would feel. I am so glad that I did. This album creates a beautiful peaceful, yet sad atmosphere it is amazing. Just close your eyes and listen. And they throw in time and money, in the mix of sad and beautiful which are both good normal rock songs. This is the kind of album that you get for the sole purpose of listining to it from start to finish, because otherwise its just not as good. For some reason this album perfectly describes the whole atmosphere of the american midwest to me. Its amazing. You can also do the whole wizard of oz thing with this album which is pretty cool too. Buy it, it wont dissapoint.
0393317552|5.0|The book is the result of an attempt to explain why some civilizations (civilization is definitely not the correct word to use here. I am using it for lack of a better term. \\"A region occupied by a homogeneous ethnic group\\" is what I believe the author is basing his arguments on) came to evolve faster than others. The book consists of three parts; the first in posing the question, the second in developing theories as of why differences in speed of advancements in different civilizations occur, and lastly in applying the author's theories to different continents.<br />The author attributes differences in available natural resources at the time of exploitation as reasons of disparities in speed of development. A typical argument of his would evolve as such (excerpt from chap. 9): \\"How can we explain the concentration of the Ancient Fourteen [domesticated animals] in Eurasia? ... One reason is simple. Eurasia has the largest number of big terrestrial wild animal species, whether or not ancestral to a domesticated species. Table x.x shows that Eurasia has the most candidates ... [Table x.x contains 1) candidates and 2) percentage of candidates actually domesticated] ... But why were Eurasia's horses domesticated but not Africa's Zebras? ... Efforts at domestication went as far as hitching Zebras to carts: they were tried out as draft animals in 19C Africa, and the eccentric Lord Walter Rothschild drove through the streets of London in a carriage by zebras. Alas, zebras become impossible dangerous as they grow older. Zebras have the unpleasant habit of biting a person and not letting go. They thereby injure even more American zookeepers each year than do tigers! ...\\"<br />Diamond evidently adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy in his arguments. A quick, immediately palpable reason succeeds the initial question he poses, followed by an abundance of physiological and/or physical evidence. From the evidence yet another set of questions arise, which are in turn answered withmore ample evidence, often times supplemented with historical annectdotes.<br />Diamond's evolutionary/physiological/physical approach is not without precedents. The historian Ferdiand Braudel, as well as biologist Cavalli-Sforza for example used similiar arguments in their numerous publications. However none of their publications are as thorough in evidence and at the same time as accessible as this book. It was an enjoyable, and in a sense, relaxing read.<br />With what little knowledge I have, I gather that evolutionary theories are in (for every social phoenomenon there seems to be an associated evolutionary theoretic explanation nowadays). There will be other ways in the future to explain the very same question Diamond attempted to tackle, but till then there will be more than enough time for Diamond's \\"historical science\\" (as he puts it) to evolve.

0316666343|5.0|This book is nothing short of genius. I was amazed at how Sebold's mind works. She is a brilliant and compelling author. Susie Salmon takes us on her journey as she struggles between earth and Inbetween. Her desire to comfort her family in their grief and her yearning to move to her final destination is stirring to read. From the beginning we know who her murderer is and Sebold ALMOST manages to paint a sympathetic portrait of him. Susie's murder is graphic and disturbing, but she relay's her death to us in matter of fact tone. Susie is not consumed with her killer being found although she does cheer when someone stumbles upon a clue. We watch with her as her family members grapple with guilt as they try to move forward. It is only until Susie can let earth go that they will be able to do that.

They live their lives traveling to find work whenever and where they can. Lennie is a rather large man with enough strength to do hard work.  Unfortunately, Lennie has a mental disability, denying him the privilege of having a higher intelligence than that of a child.  George is Lennie's caretaker and best friend.  George's characteristics are opposite of Lennie.  He is intelligent and small.  Like many laborers during that time, Lennie and George dream of owning their own piece of land.  They plan to live life without a boss and make their own decisions.  Lennie and George know this dream can come true, but a set of unfortunate events, characters, and Lennie's attraction to trouble begin to alter their dreams and future plans. <BR> Throughout the novel, Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck is able to depict many themes.  The themes that are found include understanding disabilities, racism, loneliness, and segregation.  Characters that are encountered in Of Mice and Men are creatively used as symbols to describe the themes.  <BR> I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that provide good meaning and insight.  I was highly entertained by the novel. Of Mice and Men is a remarkable and extraordinary book that allows you to look into different perspectives.  Its story line is emotional and filled with suspense.
B00006M183|3.0|Pearl Jam has somewhat gone back to basics on Riot Act.   I think Riot Act will please all the fans.  The die hards will be more than happy, and people who haven't listened to much of Pearl Jam over the last few years should welcome them back.  There are some really good rockers on this album, along with some instant classics such as \\"I Am Mine\\", and \\"Green Disease.\\"  The album has a very raw, live feel to it which is a neat departure from the polished sound of Ten and Yield.  Most of the songs make for a good listen, however Riot Act is pretty spotty.  Similar to Binaural, RA has ups and downs.  Most of the songs are pretty straight forward, and don't go on longer than 3 or 4 minutes.  Boom the keyboard player, is a nice addittion to the band, and will really expand Pearl Jam's live sound when they start touring next year.  All in all this is a really good Pearl Jam album, but not quite their best.    ---  After 3 years, I've gone back and listened to this.  This isn't a terrible album by any means, but it's my least favorite PJ album.  Plus, IMHO, the songs didn't translate too well live.  The new one (Avocado) is much, much better.

Justine has spent her life in this small Texas town, avoiding college for fear that it would cost her her husband working at the same dreary job for years... The two enter into an elicit affair that stretches the boundaries of what Justine thought her life was about and causes her to reevaluate everything she holds dear.<br />This movie works, but it's not on the strength of the writing...film bills itself as a comedy, but for the most part is far more dramatic. Most of the really funny moments all seem to come at the hands of Zooey Deschanel who plays a cynical worker at the department store who has fun with the public address system and with unsuspecting cosmetics customers.<br />Which brings us to where this movie does work -- the performances. Deschanel is great in her cynical voice, with impeccable comedic timing. Gyllenhall is also good as the young man who wants to be J.D. Salinger so badly he's already planning to disappear after writing one novel. Reilly, as Aniston's husband, takes a character that could very easily have been a stereotypical tank-top wearing, wife-beating husband and injects some real humanity. You get the impression that Phil Last is a man who genuinely cares about his wife and would do anything for her, he's just too stupid to realize there's a problem. Nelson, who's almost always good, compliments Reilly's bumbling good-hearted character well.<br />Aniston, however, really shines in this film. Her accent seems quite natural -- the only times it ever feels out of place is when you remind yourself how long she's played the spoiled rich girl on Thursday nights and compare the two voices. She is convincing as someone who has painted her entire life into a corner and doesn't know how to escape. Director Miguel Arteta uses a very understated style that works for the movie -- it's never too flashy, never too loud. The movie knows its pace and keeps it well. Only the script by Mike White keeps it from being a truly great work...<br />Although you can see the end of the movie coming a mile away, the performances of \\"The Good Girl\\" make it worth checking out. Perhaps for the first time in her career, Aniston has proven she can play a good deal more than this particular title would imply.keeps it well.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Please don't sleep on this album. I have read many reviews and most everybody has nailed it. This is by far the best album that I have heard in a while. This is one of two cds that I own where I don't skip s aingle track. The best song on the CD is Walk Away. This song, if she releases it as a single, will secure Christina a spot among legends such as Whitney, Celine, Mariah, and dare I say Aretha and Patty Labelle? If this is how good she sounds at 21, think about how she will sound in 5 years.  If I want to hear a beautiful voice and excellent lyrics, I'll put in Stripped.
0553381687|5.0|All the great epic fiction - be it LotR or WoT or Shannara or StarWars, or even the much praized Harry Potter - evolve around some unsuspecting village boy destined to overcome the ultimate super-villain (who had usually once been defeated but regained strength), and always our unsuspecting boy is guided by some wizened and powerful mentor, at least in the beginning: Frodo guided by Gandalf to destroy Sauron, Rand al'Thor guided by Moraine to face the Dark One, Skywalker guided by Kenobi to challenge the evil embodied by the Emperor and his right hand, the gruesome Darth Vader, or Harry Potter guided by Dumbledore on his way to battle Voldemort.<br />Not so with Ice and Fire. G.R.R. presents us with a multitude of deeply developed characters, non of them belonging to the group of unsuspecting village citizen. On the contrary, almost each of them is in his own way struggling for power, for himself, his beloved or any of purposes worth fighting for, driven by a variety of motives ranging from honor to greed, from revenge to desparation, employing methods as straightforward as warfare or as subtle as intrigue.<br />Heroism comes to these characters by nessecity of survival rather than impressed upon them by some greater cause or destiny, and it is far from being a guarantee to survive, either. All of this makes this epic so real, that you are reminded it is fiction only by the unfamiliar geografy of the world and - well - some sparsely but effectfully deployed mystery, such as bits and pieces of magic, some curious disbalance in the seasons, and an ominious but growing threat from the far north.<br />If you want to read something where you really could imagine yourself in the midst of it, this series is the right thing for you. Beside all things I said so far, it should be mentioned that between the covers of this books is packed the densest suspense, and a lot of surprises, not all of them pleasant.
6304806418|1.0|So much to learn from this movie:<BR>(1) The device of the 'generic antagonist' can never work. Banderas tries really hard. It's just silly and distracting at first, but it ends up silly and unresolvable.<BR>(2) Never make a musical about electoral politics. It's as inspiring as a feature-length campaign ad.<BR>(3) Avoid showing every damn moment! Her rise, the best part of the movie, took an hour. Her elections took another hour! Her death took yet another hour! And it seemed like a lifetime!<BR>(4) The best singing on earth can't help a script that runs three times as long as it should, and which says nothing new after the first 30 minutes.<BR>(5) When writing musicals, less is more. Throw away everything repetitive, everything trivial: songs, music, lyrics, ideas, set pieces ... there were moments at the beginning where I thought the creators had some sense of this. And then they just went on some sort of mindless drunken bender, echoing themselves ad nauseum.<BR>Please -- Hollywood -- Webber -- please try to value the time of the little people! We don't have any true free time! Because there's so much junk to consume!
0553381709|5.0|I will refrain from getting into judgement whether Storm is better as Game or Clash, but it definitely upholds the standards set by G.R.R.<BR>The most remarkable feature of this epic fantasy saga, setting it apart from all others, is the absence of a quest. Also absent is a clear distinction between overwhelming good and overwhelming evil, though certainly some of the characters are more evil than others. What is unique for this series is the in-depth development of individual characters of all sides of the conflict(s). The characters which we learn most about are not nessecarily the greatest heros or greatest villains. Characters which we grew to dislike over the course of the first installments suddenly are given their own voices, calling for understanding, which we grow reluctant to withhold. For example, even if it would never cross our mind to forgive Jamie the Kingslayer for throwing little Bran out the window, we come to understand and respect certain aspects of his personality. <BR>What also sets this saga apart from all others is the complete unpredictability of the outcome. Even in the classic of all classics of the genre, the ultimate victory of good over evil is predictable from the very beginning, the only question remaining how it will be brought about. In ASoIaF we don't even know the ultimate goal, let alone whether it will be achieved or not (I would not even be surprised finding myself surprised by the revelation that the feared Others aren't bad at all, but simply misunderstood champions of some uncomprehensible cause of greater good). G.R.R. keeps us suspended, secondguessing and tearing ourselves apart in awaiting the next sequel, making this the best fantasy series ever encountered.
B00005YUPO|1.0|I ordered Baby Mozart after hearing about it from a number of my friends.  My 5 month old daughter loved it and would squeal with delight when it was on, so we decided to get her a couple more of the DVD's.  When we received Baby Bach and put it on my daughter started crying within the first 5 minutes and wanted nothing to do with it.  I tried it a couple more times over the next week and found no interest in this DVD.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B00006M183|5.0|Now I'm taking a big step, but I think Riot Act may be the best album that the boys of Pearl Jam have ever recorded. With a fantastic blend of quiet, soothing songs like &quot;I am Mine&quot; and &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; with straight-forward rockers like &quot;Save You&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;. I think the standout track on this album is &quot;You Are&quot;. In a song written by drummer Matt Cameron, the guitar sound is very original (this because the guitars are processed through a drum loop machine). The choir-like &quot;Arc&quot; is a nice transgretion to the end of the album. If you are a Pearl Jam fan or thinking of becoming one, this is the album to listen to. Nice work Pearl Jam!
B000065U1N|4.0|Wow, it seems that most of the movies that are debuting on the scene throughout North America carry the same theme. That idea being one of war; and by golly it isn't pretty. Out of the past 5 movies I have viewed in theatres, 3 of those involved hardcore gun battles. Pearl Harbour, Enemy of the Gates and now today's debut release of Black Hawk Down. <br />So Tell Me Where We Are <br />The movie begins in the year 1993, located in the capital of Somalia, Mogadishu. The film is based on a true event that occurred back in that year. <br />The story revolves around a detailing description of a US Military adventure in Somalia. War is definitely hell as the film visually describes it. The leader of Somalia Mohamed Farah Aidid have been accused of harming innocent civilians and stealing the food that the United Nations has conveniently provided for the starving Somali citizens. Over 300,000 Somalians died of starvation as noted in the movie prologues credits. <br />Two military teams from the US : <br />Delta Force <BR>Task Force Rangers <br />.... have teamed up to rid the Taliban like militia groups surrounding the capital. <br />The Americans in this film extremely underestimated the will power of the Somalians to fight back. After losing a man, the whole 11 hour mission turns into a half day of rescuing. <br />Throughout the film, choppers go down, and the American Military motto \\"Nobody Gets Left Behind\\" seems like a bad decision as the movie progresses. The first injury leads to a huge string of bad luck that forces the Americans in and out of the town for 11 hours. <br />The amount of bloody scenes throughout the movie are incredible. I almost turned my stomach on 5 separate occasions. If you have kids, now is not the time to use the power of adult accompaniment! <br />The images of Somali lifestyle are extremely exaggerated as pictures of one of my friends vacation shows that it is not some sort of wasteland. Most people will agree with what they see in the film and build up that \\"hellhole\\" impression of Somalia, but not me. <br />The first 40 minutes is preparation for the war; the remainder is a constant battle, gunshots every 4 seconds and that is a fact. We don't really get to learn about how the characters got into the army; who they interact well with; etc. Come to think of it, after all the complaints of Pearl Harbour and its run-on plot, this seemed like the most sufficient way to narrate the film. <br />Final Thoughts on Black Hawk Down <br />Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepherd and Ewen Bremner and some characters we can remember from Pearl Harbour fill the movies cast. The movie directed by Ridley Scott is a somewhat accurate picture of the events that occured back 8 years ago and rates a 7 with me. The action scenes I believed were pretty good, yet at some times were very repetitive and trailed too much. <br />The acting was pretty good considering each actor was portraying themselves as an action figure. Dialogue seemed to not matter in this one. <br />I finally saw a new release on the first day and would recommend this film to anyone who has a good stomach. Wait 30 minutes after eating to go in the water; wait 4 hours to watch this movie after eating dinner! <br />* The Mogue is what the two US forces called Mogadishu!
B000001ESF|5.0|I cannot stress getting this album enough. If you have any curiosity about Rush and aren't quite sure which album is a good one to start off with, this is the one. Many people tend to go with Moving Pictures(Rush's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\"), the only Rush album people think is worth owning which is complete and utter B.S. The song 2112 is worth the price alone. It may not be Rush's best song in many peoples' ears, but it's certainly the best piece of music by them that I've ever heard. And I own the Rush catalog. The biggest problem Rush haters have with the band is the vocals. Well, the vocals are in full swing here. This is the wildest Geddy Lee would ever get with his singing(screaming). The title track on full volume beats any modern metal band in it's intensity(and this is a mid seventies album by a band not even considered heavy metal!). Yeah, some consider it kind of corny lyrically, but scrooooo it. The epic sci-fi/fantasy concept wasn't stale yet in the mid seventies, it certainly is now with about six billion metal bands doing it. If you ask me, this is the best introduction you could have to Rush instead of Moving Pictures which seems to be the norm. I'm not ripping on Moving Pictures, that album is amazing, but there's a lot more to Rush than Tom Sawyer.
B00006CXSS|5.0|... <br />...Well, the men of Easy Company were regular Joes. Oh, there were a few that were more educated and a <BR>few with military training but basically they were young Americans asked to perform duties that ultimately sacrificed the entire company, one way or the other. Easy Company suffered 150% casualties. Let me repeat that:150%! Can you imagine that? <br />Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have been forefront in the effort to keep our past alive through \\"Schlinder's List,\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". They are the executive producers of HBO's production of Stephen Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\". I believe the cost of the production exceeded one hundred twenty million dollars but it was worth every dime... Folks, if you liked \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", you'll love this. I loved former movie but I believe this series is even better. <br />The first episode dealt with the intense training that Easy Company went through in Georgia. They were pioneers in Airborne (Parachutists) warfare. Hanks and Spielberg <BR>deliberately did not go after the big name Hollywood stars. The best known actor appears in the first episode as the hated Captain Herbert Sobel as portrayed by David Schwimmer from the \\"Friends\\" cast. Sobel was so mean that many of his trainees talked about killing him when they arrived in Europe. The training was not only physically exhausting but Sobel was a master of mind games. However, many years later, one of the veterans of the company said <BR>that it was his rigorous training that saved many lives in combat. <br />The second episode concerned the D-Day jump of Easy Company behind Germany lines. The heroes of this episode were many but Lt. Richard Winters (later Major) begins to assert <BR>himself as an amazing leader. As you probably know, almost all of the paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to due to intense anti-aircraft fire. One of the missions of Easy Company was to wipe out some massive German cannons (88's) which were creating havocfor the landing parties on Utah and Omaha Beaches. After gathering his forces together gradually, Winters led an assault on the cannons which is now textbook military strategy on such battles. The episode is called \\"Day of Days\\" and Winters thanks God for getting him through that incredible day. <br />Easy Company was supposed to jump, accomplish their mission and go back to England. They did go back to England but not until they had fought its first big battle as an intact <BR>company in the French town of Carentan which was a valuable crossroads for both Allies and Germans. The third episode highlights the initial battle and the subsequent defensive <BR>position that the company went into after the battle to thwart massive German counterattacks. Each episode features different soldiers in their various roles. The individual acts of heroism are chronicled beautifully but nobody seems to thing much about it. They're doing their jobs and just trying to survive. <br />The fourth episode highlights the move of Easy Company into Holland where it liberates a very grateful Eindhoven. There is really no battle and the people of the town are delirious to see the Americans after years of harsh treatment from the Germans. Although there is some <BR>fighting in this episode, it is probably the least violent episode to date. A false feeling that the war may be over by Christmas, 1944 starts to evolve. It wasn't to be, of course, but the lapse in fighting lulled the men into a false sense of security. <br />The fifth episode has Easy Company traveling to Bastogne where the Germans are mounting a massive attack in a last ditch effort to stop the allies. Easy Company does not have enough <BR>ammunition, food nor the proper winter clothing but they do a miraculous job in holding off the Germans in attack after attack. This episode was directed by Hanks and reminded of the fierce battle scenes in \\"Ryan\\". Now Captain Winters is heavily featured in this episode in the battlefield as well as behind the lines where he has been promoted. He loves Easy Company and hates to sit behind a desk. There is a foreboding at the end of this episode that the near <BR>future of the company is going to be trouble. <br />Sure enough, Episode 6 concerns the now totally surrounded Easy Company's attempt to hold off German panzer attacks as well as far superior numbers. It is by far the bloodiest <BR>episode as Easy gets [beat]. The episode features a young medic who is kept frantically busy due to the injuries and his lack of supplies. At the end of the episode, the casualties have mounted to a staggering degree but Easy Company still has fight left in it and are ready to move on into Germany. <br />...
0064400557|5.0|I just read this book to my 4-year-old, and loved every page. When I was a child, I avoided reading this because I thought it would be too heartbreaking. Maybe as a sensitive child, it would have broken my heart, but from my perspective now, I think that the events are handled in the best possible manner. Life is a natural cycle, and we must cherish our time and our true friendships. It is a beautiful story, wonderfully written, and an entertaining read which I found a pleasure to read.
B000003TAR|4.0|First a confession: I was never a big Nirvana fan. While the band's music was fairly catchy, had a lot of emotion and was certainly better than that of bands like New Kids On The Block and Paula Abduhl, it was generally brought down by weak lyrical writing and Kurt Cobain's irritating voice (I know most will disagree with me here). <br />In 1993, the band released their follow up to the enormously popular Nevermind: In Utero, which was in a lot of ways a rougher, darker and more mature version of Nevermind. But did that necessarily make it the masterpiece Nevermind (in my humble opinion) wasn't? <br />The first thing you'll notice when listening to In Utero is that the production is a bit rougher than on Nevermind. The music still comes in crystal clear, and there's very little static or garbling. But the instruments sound a bit rougher this time around (sometimes I was left wondering whether or not the band ever rehearsed these songs), no doubt to reflect the darker atmosphere portrayed on the album. Kurt Cobain also sounds a lot less happy-go-lucky and more tortured than he did on Nevermind. The problem is that he simply wasn't a very good singer IMO (definitely not as good as people make him out to be). At times he sounds almost like an old woman, and other times he sounds a bit overly dramatic (in a forced way). <br />Contrary to what some may have led you to believe, In Utero does have its share of commercial leanings. Many songs like Rape Me and Serve The Servants have very pop-like beats and tempos, while there is a lot of that subtle acoustic work popular with both grunge and alternative bands. As a bonus, Nirvana throws a few country/southern rock influences into some of the songs here (such as the aforementioned Rape Me). On the other hand, there are those songs like Tourette's and Scentless Apprentice that are purposefully grating to the ears of the average listener, but for the most part, In Utero is a straight-up alternative rock album. Not a punk or heavy metal album. <br />Lyrical writing was never one of Nirvana's strong points, and In Utero is (for the most part) no exception. Every once in a while, the band will throw in some interesting and even somewhat philosophical lines (\\"I miss the comfort in being sad\\" - Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle), but for the most part, the lyrical writing is very abstract and difficult for the average listener to understand. Perhaps this is intentional as Kurt probably wanted listeners to not only hear but FEEL what he was going through, but it really detracts from the band's creative potential (as, once again, they do have their occasional gems). <br />As usual, here's a rundown of each track: <br />1. Serve The Servants - In Utero gets off to a strong start with the sarcastic yet fun pop/rock track Serve The Servants. The album features an awesome acoustic riff backed by some truly meaningful and surprisingly well written lyrics (\\"All my life I wanted a father but instead I got a dad\\"), stating that if you have loving supportive parents, appreciate them (for I Kurt Cobain wish I had the same thing). Listen to the song's verse (\\"Serve The Servants... Oh no\\"). If Kurt's singing of it sounds familiar to you, it's just because so many alternative bands thereafter have imitated it. Definitely one of the album's best. <br />2. Scentless Apprentice - This was Nirvana's first attempt at a less commercial track. Unfortunately, for them, the riff has a fairly mainstream (at least by today's standards) sound to it, and the only real screaming is during the chorus. The song is basically several verses strung together with one giant guitar arpeggio following and then Kurt screaming \\"HEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYY!!!! GO AWAY!!!!\\" The song succeeds in illustrating Kurt's suffering, and stands as one of the better tracks. <br />3. Heart Shaped Box - Probably the most mainstream song on the album, Heart Shaped Box is a song about how even though Kurt knows Courtney Love has treated him really badly, he still somehow feels this sense of love for her (I think at least a few of us can relate to that). Although Kurt's singing voice can be fairly irritating, the song's saved by its instrumental/lyrical emotion and powerful chorus. A very good track. <br />4. Rape Me - I remember first seeing this song being played on Saturday Night Live many years ago. It also got quite a bit of radio airplay where I live. As it is, Rape Me is an alternative track with a nice southern rock acoustic riff and silly but somewhat sensual lyrics (about social injustice). A very catchy if unspectacular song. <br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle - A song how grating fame can really be. Kurt Cobain attempts a country-like voice here and somewhat succeeds. The riff is simple yet effective. But the chorus is rather grating thanks to the way it is literally whined towards the end. Another decent yet unspectacular track. <br />6. Dumb - One of my personal favorites, Dumb is another pop-like track with an all around catchy tone and even a nice cello in the background. I don't quite agree with Kurt Cobain's philosophy here (\\"I think I'm dumb. But I'm just happy\\"), but the fact that he had the guts to express it makes the song all the more worth listening to. A nice, less serious break from the sometimes overly dramatic music Nirvana and most other grunge/alternative bands were playing. <br />7. Very Ape - This song could almost be considered a foreshadowing of the release of Green Day's Dookie as it is a fast paced pop-punk track with a nice riff and good drumming. It's nothing to get excited about, but a fun song nonetheless. <br />8. Milk It - Another punk-pop track, albeit slower and heavier. Milk It has a good riff backed by (guess what?) more whining courtesy of Kurt Cobain. There are some fairly interesting lyrics here, and the drumming is rock solid. All around good track. <br />9. Pennyroyal Tea - A slow, dark anti-abortion track with some nice guitarwork and a lot of emotion. The chorus is a little annoying though. The Unplugged version is actually better. <br />10 - 11. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter/Tourette's - I'll just review these two songs in the same paragraph since they're basically just a bunch of guitar noise and screaming courtesy of Kurt and Company. No doubt, these \\"songs\\" were intended to scare off some mainstreamers and not much else. Still, they really show the pain Kurt Cobain went through, and definitely have their place on the album. <br />12. All Apologies - The final track, and a good one at that. All Apologies is basically Kurt's suicide song, describing what he's been through, and why he must leave this world for good. At the end he quotes John Lennon (\\"All in all is all we are\\") as the finishing touch to this moving track. Definitely worth listening to, if just because of its realism. <br />As you can see, most of the songs on In Utero are good (though not spectacular). And because of that, it gets a 4/5 from me. I understand Nirvana was a very passionate band and wanted to focus more on feeling than technique. But a little technique can, in a lot of ways, add quite a bit of emotion to music. This is, ultimately, where In Utero falls flat on its face. The album hasn't aged very well (listening to it made me feel a very bad case of nostalgia), and there's very little in the way of experimentation. Once again, I understand Nirvana wanted to keep it simple, but a band with their potential could always stand to try something a little more creative once in a while. <br />Still, I recommend everybody gives In Utero a good listen. If you can look past the rough production and lack of much innovation, you'll find a very sincere, passionate, emotional record, that will definitely leave you wishing the full band was still alive and kicking.

B00006M183|5.0|The reason Pearl Jam is one of my favorite bands is also the same reason a lot of people gave up on them: their music changes and adapts. Riot Act is the next installment of Pearl Jam's journey. Their last album, Binaural, offered an experimental sound which worked for some songs, but not for others (even Brendan O'Brien was invited back to try to re-mix some songs so they would sound right). Riot Act is recorded and mixed in a more &quot;rock-traditional&quot; sound and it fits perfectly. Eddie Vedder writes beautiful lyrics relating to recent events and he even lets out a little steam on good old George W Bush. <BR>Overall, this album has more straight-forward rock. Mike McCready is allowed to let loose on a number of guitar solos throughout the album (something not seen too often in previous albums) and Matt Cameron adds an incredible Soundgarden-esque percussion which complements and enhances the Pearl Jam sound. Overall, a much more complete album than Binaural (which was still very good), with more edge and a touch of anger. But don't worry, there's still a couple of &quot;love&quot; songs. No ukeleles though.

B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams shows what he's capable of on this soundtrack.  The music is stronger, louder, and better than his work on the first movie's album.  It is more defined and actually paints the pictures for the listener (before the listener has even seen the movie).  I think this soundtrack is phenomenal, certainly a must-own for score collectors like myself.
B00006LLLN|3.0|I am a diehard fan of Alison Krauss and Union Station.  That said, this is a live album with all that implies.  The band's performance is of course flawless -- and I echo the &quot;What did you expect&quot; reviewer who preceded me.<br />But in my unprofessional and unsolicited opinion, the &quot;crowd noise&quot; is mixed WAY too loudly into thie album.  Usually, one hears the applause as a crowd recognizes the tune being started by the band -- and then the applause at the end, the whistles, the cheers, etc, are brought back into audibility as the song is finished.<br />Not so with this album.  I had no idea people in Kentucky had such a poor sense of rhythm.  The annoying clapping along with the music persists through some of the songs, severely detracting from the enjoyment of them. <br />This is annoying enough when one has paid to hear a performance by professional musicians and is hindered in doing so by an inconsiderate and discourteous audience.  But if you want to hear the powerful and magical performance that is &quot;Live&quot;, you have to listen to the dysrhythmic noises of the audience.  At least no loud drunk yelled &quot;Rock And Roll!&quot; or &quot;Free Bird!&quot;<br />Much as I hate to do so, I am selling this album used.  Someone with a tin ear is going to get a heck of a deal.
B00006M183|4.0|This album is proof positive that Pearl Jam will never fade as a vital, heartfelt and important band.  Perhaps their most diverse outing since Vitology, this album is one of their best.  I would personally put it third on my all-time list behind Vs. at #1 and Ten at #2.  It has something for everybody.  Hard and soft, fast and slow.  Even a &quot;protest&quot; song, in Bushleaguer.  If you are a fan, you probably have it already.  If you are curious about Pearl Jam, this would be a good album to start your collection with.  It showcases all of the bandmembers strengths.  Get it.  Good, solid, beautiful rock n' roll.
B00006M183|5.0|This album is a good comeback after binaural (not that binaural was all that bad).  If you just like Ten and Vs, you probably won't like this.  If you've liked all their albums up till now, this one will be no exception.  There some great material in here, good riffs, good lyrics, and a lot of layered guitars.  My standout tracks would have to be Can't Keep, Love Boat Captain, Thumbing My Way, Green Disease, and You are.  I can't wait for the tour!!!
0783225881|5.0|I come from Australia so baseball does not have the same impact as it does in the USA.<br />However, we have a game known as cricket which, to us, has the same effect as baseball has to the USA.<br />I think &quot;Field Of Dreams&quot; is a fantastic movie as it moves the soul.<br />I lived on a vegetable farm as a boy (I'm 46 now) and we used to play cricket in the front yard.<br />Opposite the yard was a vegetable field and, at the appopriate time of the season, corn was planted.<br />Nothing would please me more than to have my father walk out and say &quot;do you want to have a bowl son&quot;.<br />That is why this movie touches me so.<br />Buy it and enjoy!
B00006G8LB|5.0|A trusted friend had recommended this movie with two reservations<br />1. \\"Kirsten Dunst..she was okay..pretty enough but not how I thought the Spiderman's herione should look.\\"<br />and 2. \\"too many computerized special effects\\"<br />Wrong on both counts. Kirsten Dunst glowed and was the perfect girl next door from a dysfunctional family. She's beautiful.<br />And the effects...my god, they were fantastic. I never once sat there thinking..oh, there they go and again -- Tobey McGuire couldn't do that...which leads me to my next compliment....Talk about perfect casting...I'm surprised Hollywood didn't cast a Backstreet Boy! McGuire was believable before and after his transformation.<br />William Dafoe puts the StarWars IV's villain and especially the 4th Batman's villains to shame. He chewed up the scenary and spewed out a believable character.<br />This is a movie for the whole family!!! If only the world had heros like Spiderman!!
B00006M183|5.0|Surely this album will create a riot at the stores coz it really is a fantastic album.Well i have recently started listening to pearl jam i.e is about 3 months ago.I started with most underrated album binaural and found it to be a treat and then moved back to no code then vitalogy and so on.I really think that an artist reserves the right to display his maturity,creativity and verstilaty.Pearl jam has shown over the times an evolution in their music while still sticking to their grunge roots.i think i have lectured enough so i will get to the point that most of the reviews i have read bout pearl jam albums they all refer to the album TEN and that pearl jam can never accomplish the feat again,well that is exactly my point coz pj does not want to repeat themselves they want to move on so either love it or leave it ;)so now comin to the album here's a track by track:<br />Can't keep:a good experimental song once again by pj.Which sounds quite different from the usual we here these days 8/10<br />Save You:Well here is a song for all u buffs who r searching for TEN in every album a gr8 grunge song 9/10<br />Love Boat Captain:Trademak pj song with a gr8 bridge and chorus not to mention the music. 9/10<br />Cropduster:this is my fav. song on the album which is immediately likeable bcoz of its catchy tune like red mosquito. 10/10<br />Ghost:Here's another grunge song with experimentation.no doubt pj fans will like it. 9/10<br />I am mine:Well u all must have heard this one unlike n e thing i have ever heard the most wonderful thing about the song r the lyrics which can be interpreted in so many ways 10/10.<br />Thumbing my way:gr8 acoustic song which reminds me of &quot;OFF HE GOES&quot;.A classic 9/10.<br />You Are: Sounds like a zeppelin song the influence is quite clear.need i say more the name zeppelin is synoymous with success. 9/10<br />Get Right: Nothing much to say bout this one reminds me of classic rock.a good song 8/10<br />Green disease: This is an all orignal pj song gr8. 9/10<br />HelpHelp: if the beatles did grunge this would be the result cool song. 8/10<br />Bush leaguer: pj take on politics this is another song with spoken dialogue like i'm open cool lyrics,nice chorus. 9/10<br />1/2 full: a country song which sounds like much of stings recent work.well in my opinion its not that gr8.6/10<br />Arc: unsual and interesting vedder proves that he can even chant a tribal song.If u play it loud enough it will actually rain ;).<br />All Or None: once again the neil young influence is eminent.a nice night song.8/10<br />Conclusion: even if u don't like pj and just appreciate music i'd sat go for this one.
0671799320|5.0|&quot;The Prize&quot; is, quite simply, the best book I've ever read.  Its scope is daunting-- almost 800 pages-- and it took me months to get enough time to complete it. But every time I had to put it down, I couldn't wait to get back to it.  Yergin's style is masterful: a complex historical epic is told as a series of succinct anecdotes, filled with colorful characters who are deftly drawn and dramatic episodes that are vivid and alive. Along the way, &quot;The Prize&quot; provides an amazing education on the development of modern industry, the creation of the global economy, and just about every important historical event of the past 150 years. This is a compelling book: read it and you will have a far greater understanding of world events, both past and present.
B00005OMTT|4.0|When Enigma started to sound in Spain I must say I didn't like at all. I hated Sadeness. Now is one of my favourite songs in the history of music. I started apreciating 1 or 2 years later listening to my dad's CD. I rate 4 out from 5 cos there are some changes I would do in the best songs album. As I've read from you, jerry, the 2 songs you like are instrumental and more or less soft, relaxing. 1st cd, MCMXCa.c. has 2 \\"strong\\" songs (Principles of lust, which contains Sadeness and Find love, and Mea culpa), 1 intro as every Enigma cd, 3 more relaxing (Callas went away, Knockin on forbidden doors and Rivers of belief) and the other one is like an intro (The voice and the snake). <BR>2nd one, Cross of changes is, perhaps, stronger (Return to innocence, I love you...I'll kill you-which I love-, Silent warrior, Age of loneliness and Out of the deep). There is one long instrumental (Eyes of truth) and 2 short \\"melodics\\" (Dream of the dolphin and the cd closing Cross of changes).<BR>3rd, Le roi et mort, vive le roi (King is dead, Life for the King in french). More calm songs (Morphin thru time, Shadows in silence, Almost full moon and Odyssey of the mind), and 3 stronger (Why, TNT for the brain and Roundabout). The other 3 are relaxin I think (the single Beyond the invisible, Child in us and Prism of life).<BR>Finally, The screen behind the mirror: 5 strongs (Push the limits, Gravity of love, Modern crusaders, Camera obscura and Silence must be heard). 5 relaxin (Traces, Screen behind the mirror, Endless quest, Between heart and mind and my favourite Smell of desire).<BR>I think four of them are very similar in that way, maybe second is the strongest and could be worse for you. Try with 1st or 3rd, but if you have the oportunity make yourself a mix with the calmest songs I recomend you: Callas went away, Knockin on forbidden doors, Rivers of belief, Beyond the invisible, Shadows in silence, Almost full moon, Traces, Between mind and heart and Smell of desire. Take into account that there are not breaks between songs in the cd's if you want to mix them. It seems me a bit unfair not to include my 2 favourite songs: Principles of lust (12 minutes) and I love you...I'll kill you (9 minutes). They mix strong and calm passages.<BR>ciao
0440180295|5.0|On February 13-14, in the year of 1945, 65,000 incendiary explosives were dropped upon the peaceful and beautiful German city of Dresden by British and American forces, burning 135,000 men, women, and children to death (15,000 more than the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima).  So it goes.<BR>The author of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut, was one of the 100 people to survive the bombing, and then only because he was deep under the ground in a slaughterhouse being held as a prisoner of war.  For the main character of the story, Kurt Vonnegut invented Billy Pilgrim, the imaginary protagonist of Slaughterhouse-Five, to also witness the somewhat unknown firebombing of Dresden.  The damage that the event inflicted upon Billy's mind becomes apparent throughout the course of the book, beginning with the fact that he experiences time by jumping from event to event in his life, similar to a severely shell-shocked individual.               <BR>The story is presented in a calm and informative manner, with absurd, disturbing, and often unexpected events mixed with the often mundane and uneventful story of Billy's life.  It is through these bizarre events that many of the book's main points are presented; for instance, aliens known as the Tralfamadorians (who view the universe through the fourth-dimension) kidnapped Billy Pilgrim in his warped mind and showed him that the true way to view the universe was to see it all at once, as a huge picture, and then to focus only on the times that were pleasant.   <BR>In my opinion, Slaughterhouse-Five is a book that should be read by every human being on the planet.  Who knows, maybe people might realize that destroying people's lives and minds over issues they don't have anything to do with won't make the world a better place.

B00005NTJK|3.0|I HATE this new Benefit Remaster -- it [stinks] big time.  They castrated this recording, all the rough edges (i.e. Rock) have been \\"polished\\" off -- especially the guitar riffs!<br />For perspective, I LOVE this album, it's one of my 3 favorite Tull albums; I purchased it when it first appeared in the US.  Obviously, (in lieu of his recent folkie sound) Ian is trying to \\"reinvent\\" the past, making his back catalog easier listening for his Prog/Folkie fans.  I liked the hard rock sound of Stand Up, Benefit and Aqualung and lost respect/interest in Tull when he went the \\"concept\\" route, with far less success than The Who and the Pretty Things.<br />Don't sell your old CD, like I did, before you listen to this sell out.  I was going to purchase the Remastered Stand Up, but now that I know better -- forget it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|To hell with catchy poppy tunes like Radiohead's ticket song, Creep. Radiohead treks on into a new stage on OK Computer. The clang and clatter of OK Computer just sounds like pots and pans at first but once you get it into your head there's no getting rid of it. On Ok Computer the Oxford quintet create their best album ever. with melodical hooks, tantilizing guitar riffs, stirring drum beats and haunting lyrics they make one of the best records of the nineties. From beginning to end the album is infectious and intriguing. It starts with the cello-like guitar driven Airbag that dazzles and soars. It ends with the calm and relaxing The Tourist that keeps you humming. But the album shines like no album ever shines about two and a half minutes into the epic Paranoid Android. When singer Thom Yorke sings \\"You Don't Remember!\\" and the guitar punches in, it's the most surprising and memerable moment in most any song. The entire 6 and a half minutes of Paranoid Android is gripping. but the highlight of the album is the hair raising Exit Music (For A Film). it starts with just a whisper, then a soothing echo of melody that bursts into a pounding chorus that slurs back into a waning whisper. The whole album is essentially about chaos. Subterranian Homesick Alien addresses the idea of alien's being disgusted with humanity if they ever laid eyes on it. Karma Police expresses Radiohead's view of the hypocrites that consume the radio (\\"He buzzes like a fride. He's like a detuned radio.\\") All in all OK Computer is one of the best records of the 90s and won't let you down. 10/10 Highlights: \\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\" \\"Paranoid Android\\" \\"Lucky\\" \\"Karma Police\\" \\"Airbag\\"
B00006LIRI|3.0|If you were expecting the qualitative equivalanet to U2's first compilation of singles, 'Best of 1980-1990', you will find this one a bit of a disappointment, even if you liked the music of U2 from 1990 to 2000.  Here's a song-by-song review:<br />1. \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\".  As the fourth single from their most successful record of the decade, 'Achtung Baby' (1991), this pop dity, appropriately the opening track, has excellent guitar work and a lyrical irony that would characterize the \\"reinvention\\" of U2 in its second decade.<br />2. \\"Mysterious Ways\\".  As one of their most popular singles and live songs from 'Achtung Baby', the underwater guitar sound, the funky bass-line, and a distinct lyrical shift into the secular (or is it?) would yield success of U2's debut as a pop band.  (NOTE: For U2 fans, a line is changed from the original at 1:43.)<br />3. \\"Beautiful Day\\".  If you don't know this one, a dose of optimism and heavy guitars hearlding the first single from the \\"return-to-their-roots\\" record, 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' (2000), you have probably been living under a rock.<br />4. \\"Electric Storm\\" [William Orbit Mix].  As the first of two new songs on this release, it is curious that the band included a remix on the original compilation.  While the first 50 seconds are appropriate for the accompanying lyrics, this remix lacks the venom of the original version of the song (included only on the Limited Edition bonus disc), the quality of which lies somewhere between just-good and classic.<br />5. \\"One\\".  If any song of U2 in the 1990s will be remembered, it is \\"One\\", a bittersweet ballad with multiple interpretations, which has been covered by a number of artists (e.g., Johnny Cash, R.E.M.) and would have been just as big of a hit as the other contender for U2's best ballad (\\"With or Without You\\") if it had a catchier chorus.<br />6. \\"Miss Sarajevo\\".  This sleepy tune is the one single and sole entry included from the U2/Brian Eno collaboration, 'Passengers: Original Soundtracks' (1995).  Unfortunately, because of the deletion more than one minute, what was a stunning guest performance by Pavorati on the original version seems awkward immediately following Bono's subdued verse on the edited version here.<br />7. \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\".  This relatively traditional and mellow single from U2's exploration into art rock, 'Zooropa' (1993), moves along nicely, with its value as a U2 classic derived from the lyrical imagry and fine vocal performance by Bono.<br />8. \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\".  Although the lyrics are a bit hokey for Bono, this single was originally an ode to the deceased INXS singer who killed himself in 1997 that took on new meaning in the nationwide grief post-9/11.  Nonetheless, it seems a bit out of place among the tracks from the 1990s.  (NOTE:  This single was not actaully released until 2001, which is when the Grammy-winning \\"Walk On\\" and Elevation\\" were also released, leading me to wonder why these stronger tracks were not also included.)<br />9. \\"Gone\\" [New Mix].  As one of the three tracks from the much-maligned 'Pop' (1997) record, this one was not a single, but it is hard to argue against its inclusion on this compilation, as this plodding rocker is a lyrical highpoint of the U2 canon and has remained a live staple.  On this \\"new mix\\", certain vocals and guitar parts have been re-recorded and the middle section has been re-arranged to mirror the live version - unfortunately, the result is flat and uninspiring when compared to the original.<br />10. \\"Until the End of the World\\".  This is another strong non-single rocker, this time from 'Achtung Baby', which lyrically a conversation between Jesus and Judas.  It has rightfully remained within the U2 live set for a decade.<br />11. \\"The Hands That Built America\\".  This is the other new song on this compilation and the theme to the upcoming film 'Gangs of New York'.  Initially, it comes across as a over-orchestrated and uninteresting ballad; when Bono's filtered, operatic vocal break shows up in the middle, you may find yourself cringing; and with the thrown-in lyrical reference to 9/11 at the end (without any real contextual connection to the rest of the song), one has to wonder what were they thinking?!  <br />12. \\"Discotheque\\" [New Mix].  As one of the most controversial singles and introduction to the poorly-received 'Pop' record, this version is the most different from the remixes here.  Unfortunately, where the original version was pumped up with many sonic colors and heavy beats, wonderfully closing the seemingly wide gap between club music and metal, this version is, quite simply, unfulfilling by comparison.<br />13. \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\".  The non-LP single from the 'Batman Forever' (1995) soundtrack is a welcome inclusion here, an autobiographical rocker which characterizes U2-in-the-1990s - \\"You don't know what you're doin' - babe, it must be art\\".<br />14. \\"Staring at the Sun\\" [New Mix].  As the second and perhaps most well-received single from the 'Pop' record, members of the band have often stated that they could never get the tempo right on this one (as an ill-fated attempt at the song in the opening night of the PopMart tour would prove).  However, the added drum tracks in this remix here only adds a sense of disjointedness as compared to the original.<br />15. \\"Numb\\" [New Mix].  In the attempts to rewrite parts of U2's second decade by including several remixes, this is the one that was tampere with the least, and as such, may actually be better than the original, which was easily their most experimental and controversial \\"single\\" ever.  In this version, the vocals have been moved up in the mix (so you can actually here what the Edge is chanting . . . well, kind of), the Bono's falsetto of the chorus (\\"I feel numb\\") in the original has been replaced by the deadpan voice of an unnamed singer who actually sounds numb (drummer, Larry Mullen, I presume),  and some guitar has been added to make the sound a bit more anthemic.<br />16. \\"The First Time\\".  This is the third non-single track included on the compilation, and while lyrically strong, the minimalist musical elements are far to similar to a previous U2 hit (\\"All I Want Is You\\") to warrant inclusion here.  On this note, one has to wonder, where are the more experimental singles that defined the decade (such as \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Lemon\\") or even the stronger more traditional-U2 releases (such as \\"Please\\" or the single semi-acoustic version of \\"Wild Horses\\")?  Whatever the answer, this compilation could have been bettter constructed and pales by comparison to its 1980s counterpart, even if you liked U2 in the 1990s.
B000002TYK|3.0|When Dave Grohl sings \\"I'll stick around\\" he ain't wrong. The ex-Nirvana drummer is sticking around. His band has gripped the ears of rock lovers everywhere. With his breakthrough record Grohl shows the world he's not just the drummer of the most successful rock band of the '90s. The Foo Debut is a rock solid rock record spilling with great harmonies and chilling guitar riffs. It's full of great post-grunge style rock anthems like \\"I'll Stick Around\\" \\"Weenie Beenie\\" and \\"Wattershed\\" while still pulling off great pop hooks like \\"Big Me\\" and \\"This Is A Call.\\" Their debut may not be as ambitious or bold as the follow ups but it's definetly worth any Foo collection. 7/10 Highlights: \\"I'll Stick Around\\" \\"This is a Call\\" \\"For All The Cows\\" \\"Big Me\\"
B00006M183|5.0|This is definitely one of Pearl Jam's best albums. Buy this album - you won't be disappointed!
B00006M183|4.0|And here it is, PJ's latest offering. Admittedly I felt disappointed on first listen. Why? No tunes besides the 1st single grabbed me. But then again, listening to it as background music with your kids screaming & carrying on in the same room doesn't help. Now, after a few thorough listens via headphones & without interruptions, I've fallen in love with the record, as with all past PJ releases(except maybe for No Code).<BR>We are still left with an album with no real potential commercially appealing singles. I Am Mine is a good example. As great as that song is, it is not what the mass market are after any more. The kids these days are not interested in hearing what any band has to say after their 2nd album. Why? Simple; someone else has come along & replaced them. Replaced that void.<BR>That is what's happened to Pearl Jam. BUT not for the fans, & those who can be objective enough & dedicate the time to have a good listen. This album ROCKS! It is a continuation of Binaural, which continued on from Yield(to a lesser extent).<BR>What is surprising here is that the drummer Matt Cameron has contributed so much to the writing(both music & lyrics). Below's a quick rating(from 10) for each song. Without a doubt this could change after many more listens...<BR>1. Can't Keep - great lyrics. Interesting melody line. Good arrangement. (8)<BR>2. Save You - Straight fwd rock song. Hints of old PJ. (7)<BR>3. Love Boat Captain - more of that experimental stuff. They pull it off here. Brilliant lyrics! Only drawback is the sudden change in melody at around 1:30 into it. Great bridge. (9)<BR>4. Cropduster - interesting 7/8 timing in verses. Otherwise nothing really new here. (7)<BR>5. Ghost - another straight fwd rock tune. (7)<BR>6. I Am Mine - excellent! (10)<BR>7. Thumbing My Way - brilliant change of pace. Good placement on album too. WOuld love to see Bruce Springsteen do a version, or at least get up on stage & sing with Eddie. (10)<BR>8. You Are - love the distortion here! Must be Matt's idea for the song. Would like to hear them do more of this stuff. Can be a surprisingly successful single. (10)<BR>9. Get Right - another Cameron contribution. Great guitar sound here. Verse structure has hints of early Midnight Oil. (9)<BR>10. Green Disease - great song, although sounds like parts were borrowed from a few places. The ending on verses sounds not unlike XTC's Senses Working Overtime. (8)<BR>11. Help Help - see 10. Great build-up going on throughout this one. (9)<BR>12. Bushleaguer - one of the best tracks! Great choice as B-side to I Am Mine.(10)<BR>13. Half Full - Rhythm too similar to Rival from Binaural. (7)<BR>14. Arc - PJ always throw one of these obscure tracks on. I like it. Very Middle-Eastern sounding. Choice or coincidence? (9)<BR>15. All Or None - would be interesting to see the other tracks PJ contemplated putting on as a closer. This slow number is nothing special. (7)<br />Overall, a great CD. One gets the feeling that Eddie is trying to say too much in some songs. Like the older classic tunes they wrote, he needs to remind himself that often less-IS-more! I think it's only a matter of time 'till Eddie releases a solo effort. Some tunes here would sit well on that, such as Thumbing & All Or None. <BR>If u're a devoted PJ fan, u will NOT be disappointed. If u are new to them, start with something else, like VS or Vitalogy(Ten was different to anything they did after). In fact, those two are probably their most underated efforts. Underated u ask? Yes, because they should be regarded as rock masterpieces, of any era since Rock was born almost 50 years ago! <br />Pearl Jam & Eddie Rock!!!

B00006CXXU|5.0|i think this cd was the best cd she has done, and that is very real... i love the mix of different types of music on it... i would recomend it to anybody..
0316666343|5.0|I finished this book in one night! That's how good it was. It had an interesting point of view, leading us to wonder HOW and WHEN the mystery will be solved, instead of wondering who did the crime. Susie's emotions to many things are well portrayed and we are able to see others thoughts. This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I strongly recomend this book to anyone of any age, oldeer that 12.
079070546X|4.0|Clark Griswold is the quintessential \\"boy who never grows up,\\" an idealistic dreamer with sky-high expectations and wide-eyed innocence. Anticipating a hefty bonus from his employer, he places an order for a swimming pool, invites his parents and in-laws to his home, and eagerly looks forward to enjoying an old-fashioned \\"family Christmas.\\"<br />Of course, everything goes horribly wrong--the tree, the lights, family squabbles, snooty neighbors, a coldhearted boss and an unexpected visit from Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid is priceless). All of the mayhem wears on poor Clark until he finally snaps...the result of his \\"breakdown\\" is complete comic bliss.<br />This Griswold saga is second only to the original \\"Vacation\\" as the funniest movie in this series. Next time you feel overwhelmed by the \\"stress\\" of the Holiday Season, pop this movie into the VCR and relax; your subsequent laughter will be the perfect elixir to cure any holiday blues.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Before viewing SPIDERMAN, I could definitely not have been classified in the Spiderman lover category.   I considered the comics to be childish as well as bland.  However, after seeing this movie my mindset (amazingly) was forced onto a different path.  What a great production!  There is none of the comics reiteration of the same plot, or confusion of scattered storylines.  This film is concise, intriguing, and I must face it- VERY cool!!!   I find myself waiting (with baited breath) for SPIDERMAN 2, and wanting a LOT MORE!
0345440900|1.0|My doctor lent me this book to read when I was having problems getting my 3 month old to sleep.  I have switched doctors since then.  The author is know-it-all, condescending and very annoying in her book.  Her opinion on breastfeeding is a joke.  She obviously did not breastfeed her babies very long and is one of those people who thinks formula is just as good despite all of the scientific research to support breastfeeding.  She believes that there is something wrong with a mother who breastfeeds past a year.  She actually had the nerve to write that she thinks a mother who breastfeeds past a year does it because she secretly enjoys being the only one who can calm the baby.  Ridiculous!  I hated this book!  It is a detriment to new parents and babies!  Don't buy it!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Before viewing SPIDERMAN, I could definitely not have been classified in the Spiderman lover category.   I considered the comics to be childish as well as bland.  However, after seeing this movie my mindset (amazingly) was forced onto a different path.  What a great production!  There is none of the comics reiteration of the same plot, or confusion of scattered storylines.  This film is concise, intriguing, and I must face it- VERY cool!!!   I find myself waiting (with baited breath) for SPIDERMAN 2, and wanting a LOT MORE!
B00006GEKB|5.0|This is like my faovrite CD in thr world.  I didn't really like Avril because she was anti-Britney, but she rocks and her CD is the best!  I like &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot; the best.
0790729628|2.0|If Dir. Scott had wanted the movie made this way he would have made it this way, no this is a farce created by the Corporation to cut back on violence and make more money off a VERY GOOD movie, Dir. Scott had nothing to do with the &quot;Director's Cut&quot;. Just a rumor, there is supposedly a 3.5 hour version with voice over. The REAL Directors cut I assume.
B00006690G|5.0|With pulsing beats and lyrical flows that will put anyone else in the buisness to shame, this is by far Eminem's best work yet.  Tracks 2, 18, and 13 are some of my favorites.  Wether you have been a fan of Eminems since the beggining or are a new fan I highly recommend this CD.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina brings it to you in a whole different light for 2002 with this new cd. I am not a big Christina Aguliera fan but I always liked her singing and thought she had real talent out of all the teen pop stars. Now that she has broke out on her own creativley and musically on this one its a whole new christina...for the better and worse. She might get dissed for the dirty video and dressing in less things but it does not make the talent disappear.....Listen up, Things like:<br />Cant Hold us Down(Mostly for the lyrics and the point of view she was coming from...beat could have been better..but she had Kim reppin on this track too), Walk Away, Fighter(Tight rock track that could be a single), Infatuation, Impossible (Alicia keys hooked this track up...it has a blues/jazz sound to it), beautiful(Another tight track....the next single...soudns like a whole different christina), Make Over, Cruz, Dirty(Featuring my boy redman..and sample of his old beat), The voice within, Keep on singing my song.  <br />Overall these are the songs im feeling and think they really show christina in a whole new way. Her original fans might be thrown off somewhat or may be pulled in even more. either way she made a turn for the better by covering topics so serious that it makes her first album look like childs-play. She covers serious topics with serious music that will definetly make a mark for the upcoming months to follow. If you are looking for something different with strong vocals and a good mix of many different styles in music...then this is the album for you. Here all hype and gloss is stripepd to show the true talent behind C.A......The time is now!
B00006CXXU|5.0|CHRISTINA AGUILERA \\"STRIPPED\\" IS THE BEST FEMALE CD I PERSONALLY HAVE EVER LISTENED TO. AND I DO, ALL DAY LONG , AT HOME , IN THE CAR.. WHERE EVERY I CAN. MISS AGUILERA IS CERTAINTLY IN A LEAGUE OF HER OWN AND HAS FOUND HER OWN, FAR FAR AWAY FROM THE LIKES OF SPEARS AND SKATERBOI LAVIGNE. SHE CAN ACTUALLY BRING YOU TO YOUR FEET, TEARS TO YOUR EYES AND JUST MAKE YOU FALL INTO A WORLD OF MUSICAL ELATION. HER VOCALS ARE OUTSTANDING AS ALWAYS, HOWEVER, THERE IS A REAL SOULFUL ROCKISH SOUND IN HER CORDS NOW GIVING IT SUCH A UNIQUE SOUND. I AM IN LOVE WITH THE SONGS \\"THE VOICE WITHIN\\" \\"BEAUTIFUL\\" \\"IMPOSSIBLE\\" THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS CD IS BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY STATE WHICH SONG IS MY FAVORITE, IT IS IN MY OPINION, A MASTERPEICE.... MY HAT OFF TO CHRISTINA AGUILERA!
B000069AT7|4.0|It really is a stroke of genius to include the original version of the film as well as the new version - and a joy to have 5.1 sound available for the first time (English and French for the new film, and E, F and Spanish for the old one). The sound quality is really stunning. But as if that was not enough, the package includes the soundtrack of the film, and also a version of the film with a live orchestra playing the soundtrack, complete with the sound of the cinema audience clapping and cheering in the background. Simply Brilliant, as well as unexpected. Thank you! The pictures are much clearer and sharper than the Laserdisk version, but (and this is a big but!) for some reason, the DVD's have Macrovision copy protection, so the picture occasionally freezes and jumps when it trips in. The accompanying book contains the script as well as pictures and anecdotes from the making of the film, and the Bonus Material was very interesting indeed, giving fascinating insights into the making of the film. My children loved the Solar System game (which is very funny - You select a planet and &quot;ET&quot; tells you about it - definitely not for anyone over about 8!). Apart from the copy protection - you will know by now how your system responds to that, its a treat. I'm glad I got it, and my children love it.
B00006M183|5.0|All I have to say, is WOW!  This is the most original, experimental, rocking, and moody record yet.  The new usage of organ by Boom, adds an intriguing new twist on songs like \\"I am Mine\\", and the wonderful \\"Love Boat Captain.\\"  \\"Get Right,\\" and \\"Save You\\" are two of the hardest rocking PJ songs yet.  For those who lost the band after Vitalogy, do not worry.  There is plenty here to keep you fair weather fans dancing as well.  Mike's guitar solos are even more prominent here then on Ten, and the sheer variety of the album transcends any one song that may dissapoint you.  \\"Cant Keep\\" and \\"All or None\\" are very No Codesque in nature, but amazing additions.  This could really be a greatest hits album with 15 brand new songs, if that makes any sense.  It really is that great, and anyone who hasn't picked it up, get off your butt and do so now!
B00006RAKP|3.0|Again its just another rehash that totally ignores &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, It is the 1ST to include his ENTIRE career, But can we at least have one more CD with those rare gems, beggining with &quot;Border Song&quot; and &quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot; as the 1ST 2 songs?
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie was outstanding, I was shocked.I couldn´t belie what I was watching.It was very similar to Lost Highway, another great movie.<BR>This movie is so powerfull, strange, human, difficult to understand, wild, cool, hated, loved and beutiful.<br />Of course it took me a while to figure it out, but it was worth it.But I won´t tell you the real meaning of the film, but it´s something about Hollywood´s monster machine and how it create or destroys a whole new person.<br />Betty is this beautiful blonde that moves to Hollywood to become a star.She stays at her aunt´s department.There she meets Rita, a strange woman that says that she losted her mind in a car accident, in Mulholland Drive.<BR>That´s all I can say.<br />Naomi Watts is so talented, she seems to be a regular actrees at first but you´ll see.Laura Harring is an Oscar winner, she´s wonderfull.<BR>Justin Theroux was espectacular, his character was anoying and so well done.<br />This movie gave me the chills, that old couple, the monsters behind the cofee shop and the cowboy.Was very scary.<BR>One of the things I loved was the music, God, what a maste´rpiece.Club Silencio´s scene touched me, I was almoust crying like Rita and Betty.<br />Mulholland Drive is the best film of the year 2001 and 2002 so far.It´s so weird.Lynch´s a genius, I love that director.<BR>His way of seeing the world and how he manages to transmit that in a film.<br />Mulholland Drive is a blast!!<br />MULHOLLAND DRIVE(U.S.A/2001)<BR>Rated R<BR>Directed by David Lynch<BR>Starring: Naomi Watts, <BR>Laura Harring, Juatin Theroux<BR>Running time: 145 minutes<br />Final Grade: A+(10)
B00006CXSS|5.0|I read the book and loved it.  The HBO series does more than great justice to Stephen Ambrose's book.  You really feel like your in the battle and get a great understanding of America's  heroes and the sacrifices they endured during that time period.  This is a powerfull series and I plan on watching it over a few times.  Well worth it.

B000002GJH|5.0|Before Pearl Jam came out with their first album and soundgarden really established themselves, they recorded this excellent tribute album to the recently deceased Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone.<BR>With all the emotion involved, the members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden united to create a truly amazing rock/grunge album.  <BR>The first track \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" is a brilliant song with Cornell adding just the right amount of soul and tilt to the vocals.  Excellent lyrics such as \\"words never listen and teachers never learn.\\"  Bolstered by a killer Mike McCready guiatr solo this is one of the best songs on the album.<BR>Next comes the monster \\"Reach Down\\" with 11 minutes of guitar pyrotechniques by Stone Gossard and McCready.  Cornell absolutely WAILS on this song with his unbelievable vocal range.  If you dig long and loud guitar solos this is a great song, if you enjoy more punchier and concise solos this is most likely boring and you'll like the next song much better.<br />\\"Hunger Strike\\" follows next with the excellent interplay between Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell.  This is the one song most people remember from this album mainly because it's played on the radio.  It is a great song but a bit overrated.<BR>Temple continues on with the rock atmosphere with \\"Pushin' Forward Back.\\"  This sounds like a demo from Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" with the soaring guitars and driving drums.  The fake ending is a nice suprise too.<BR>\\"Call Me a Dog\\" is a decent power ballad.  Mike's solo is the high point and the song really builds to greatness at the end.<BR>\\"Times of Trouble\\" is a blatant reference to Andrew Wood's drug problems which eventually killed him.  This is one of the high points of the album especially with Cornell ripping it up on the Harmonica.  Pearl Jam's song \\"Footsteps\\" has the same melody but with  different lyrics and can be found on the \\"Jeremy\\" single.<BR>Next comes \\"Wooden Jesus\\" and \\"Your Savior.\\"  In my opinion these are the low points of the album.  Thereisn't a lot of musical development going on.  Decent at best.<BR>\\"Four Walled World\\" follows being one of if not THE best song on the album.  Seven miuntes of pure grunge.  All members contribute emensely to this track.  Drummer Matt Cameron is pounding on the drums like his life depended on it, Stone provides a killer riff, Jeff's Bass is nicely present with some cool runs, Cornell is wailing his best and mike is spectaular on the end solo.  All this leads up to a great ending with cornell crooning \\"oh yeah!!<BR>\\"All Night Thing\\" is a nice breath of fresh air after the firestorm of \\"four walled world.\\"  <BR>The is a fabulous album with so much emotion and great performances all around.  If you're tired with all the radio friendly wanna be grunge bands (Creed, Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Staind, Bush, Default.  None of them from Seattle I might add) this album is great.  If you like guitar solos, superb drumming, soundgarden, pearl jam, grunge, rock and roll, excellent vocals, genuine emotion and just plain great music pick this up.  As great as this album is, it gets better with each listen.
B00006M183|4.0|Great album, from a great band. Not their best work but still very very good. I liked all of the songs but i personal prefer \\"save you\\" , \\"ghost\\", \\"You are\\" and off course \\"Love boat captain\\". Great drums, reefs, and a lot of solo work by mike maccready. But still, pearl jams best album, is and problably will continue to be No Code. ...
B00006CXXU|5.0|THIS IS A REALLY A GREAT CD FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES MUSIC REALLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE HONESTLY PUT HER HEART AND TIME INTO EACH SONG! THERE ARE NO FILLERS!! THE ONLY SONG I DONT LIKE IS IM OK WHICH IS A SAD SONG ABOUT HER ABUSIVE DAD BUT ALL IN ALL KIND OF BORING. THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE AT LEATS NOMINATED AT THE GRAMMIES FOR BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR. THIS GIRL'S GOT A POWERFUL VOICE AND PUTS FULL EMOTION INTO EVERY SONG UNLIKE SOME OTHER BLONDIE I CAN THINK OF... OKAY BRITNEY SPEARS! I ADMIT IM A PRITNEY HATER AND PROUD OF IT! SHE'S AN INSULT TO MUSIC CUZ SHE ACTUALLY CALLS HERSELF A SINGER( ALTHOUGH TO THE PPL WHO IDOLIZE HER SHE'S CALLED AN \\"ENTERTAINER\\" CUZ EVEN THEY KNOW SHE CANT SING WORTH NOTHING)HOPEFULLY WITH THIS NEW ALBUM CHRISTINA WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PULL HERSELF OUT OF THE SAME CATEGORY AS BRITNEY SPEARS AS \\"POP PRINCESS\\" AND RIGHTFULLY TAKE ON HER THRONE AS THE QUEEN. mY FAVORITE SONG ON HERE IS FIGHTER. IT AHS A TIGHT BEAT AND EVEN TIGHTER GUITAR PAYIN. OTHER GOOD ONES ARE CANT HOLD US DOWN, INFATUATION, BEAUTIFUL, IMPOSSIBLE, MAKE OVER, THE VOIVE WITHIN, CRUZ, AND WALK AWAY. BUT REALLY ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD!! I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT!!! SO GO OUT 2 THE MUSIC STORE AND SKIP THE B'S (BRITNEY) AND GO RIGHT ON TO THE C'S FOR CHRISTINA. BELIEVE ME ITS WORTH THE MONEY.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I bought the John Mayer CD the other day just to see if he truly was a DMB wannabe or not.  (Dave Matthews happens to be my favorite band by the way.)  I put the CD in my car stereo and took off driving.  At first I was a bit confused and thought I had accidently bought a new DMB album that I didnt even know existed. (He even had a song on his album named '83')  Then as I listened I noticed that Mayer actually has a sound of his own.  Even though his singing is remarkably close to that of Dave's, his guitar riffs are more upbeat and have more variation with less strumming and more picking.  I thought to myself he is just living a little kid's dream (atleast I always dreamed of being Dave Matthews) and since his music isnt quite as catchy as Dave's he would die out as quickly as he came in.  But even if he does it is still fun to listen to a new song once in awhile in between my looping tracks of Dave Matthews Band that I listen to all day long. Especially the song Your Body is a Wonderland. (This song sounds like it would fit in nicely with Dave's older stuff he used to write.) I would recommend this to anyone who likes Dave Matthews, but dont throw out the old Crash CD to make room for this one, because you will soon find yourself coming back to it.
B000066NW0|1.0|This CD is the most horrid CD I've heard in a long time.  With Avril's claims to be &quot;punk&quot; and hardcore, this album is completely and totally pop.  But don't get me wrong...I love a good pop CD just as much as the next person.  In fact, I own Hanson CDs.  That's good pop.<BR>     The only decent song on this album would have been &quot;Complicated&quot; but due to the over playing of it, I can barely stomach it.  <BR>     &quot;Losing Grip&quot; could have been a decent song, but the up and down bass sounds make me feel dizzy.  &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; could quite possibly be the worst song on the album, claiming that all people turned down by the popular hot chick in high school will turn famous---and of course, Avril will be right there waiting to pick him up.<BR>      &quot;I'm With You&quot; could have been a good song, but I think she injects the word &quot;damn&quot; to just feel older and cooler.  &quot;Mobile,&quot; &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; don't really stand out at all to me, none of the three are musical geniuses, that's for sure.<BR>      &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; it sounds really, really country and Avril strains to reach high notes.<BR>      &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; is the only song that I think has any potential now.  It's actually half-way decent.<BR>      &quot;My World&quot; just talks about Avril's normal life...and how she washes her hair for hours.  &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; is an attempt at a rap it seems, and she claims she's real.  Right.<BR>    &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot; is another song with a peek of potential, but sandwiched between &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; most people probably haven't made it to that song to hear it.  That's all I'm saying about &quot;Naked.&quot;<BR>     I think this album was a poor attempt at a debut album...I think MAYBE (and that's stretching it...) that if Avril would have come out as a pure &quot;Alanis&quot; singer, no attempt at this hardcore audience grasp, she may have been okay.  Just be yourself, show it through your music, and you'll have success.  Avril has sold tons of albums, but if she only knew what people on punk message boards were saying....

B00005JKCH|5.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" is the best movie of 2002. Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker who lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) from the death of his parents. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider and when he has spider abilities, he becomes Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is amazing in her role as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beautiful classmate. James Franco is great playing Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend. And Willem Dafoe is good playing Norman Osborn, Harry's dad. The picture and sound quality from the DVD are good. The extras are superb including the \\"HBO Making of Spider-Man\\" and the commentary. An excellent film.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam has long been undergoing an evolution, from the experimentation of No Code, the emotive calm of Yield, and through the slow burn of Binaural, but they definately have evolved. Riot Act serves itself as the product of those years, as a musically varied effort that, unlike Pearl Jam's last three understated works, does not need time to sink under one's skin. This album is a rocker! From the &quot;Oceans&quot;/&quot;Who You Are&quot; hybrid opener to the offspring of &quot;Indifference&quot; and &quot;All Those Yesterdays&quot; that closes the show, this album resurrects the classic rock and roll that we found in early Pearl Jam, without eshewing the progress they have made over these years. A return to form? Not quite. Frustratingly unfamiliar? Not exactly. A tremendously comfortable in between? Definately.<br />What's better is that Pearl Jam is once again ENTHUSIASTIC about promoting and declaring this album's presence to the world. Gone is the fame ducking which first irritated me in 1996. Pearl Jam loves their music again, and that makes me feel less guilty about loving it. Perhaps the reason for this newfound excitement is the decidedly Political stance which the album takes. Bashing Bush (Bushleaguer) and an uproar against the upper class (Green Disease) comes naturally. But Pearl Jam doesn't rage against the government as they did against the music industry with Vitalogy. If you disagree with Eddie and Co. this time around, you don't get a middle finger and &quot;Bugs&quot;. Instead you get a courteous agreement to disagree in &quot;I am Mine&quot;, a song which encourages everyone to form their own opinions and direct their own lives.<br />Pearl Jam's music, like the band, has become more accessible, more likable, and more intelligent.
6304712936|5.0|&quot;Amadeus&quot; is easily one of the best movies ever made that won Best Picture for 1984. It's a story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played wonderfully by Tom Hulce (Oscar-nominated), who was a composer all his life until he died mysteriously at the age of 35 in 1791. F. Murray Abraham won the Oscar for playing Antonio Salieri, a competent composer, and Milos Forman won the Oscar for Best Director. I have this movie on DVD and I am glad to have it for my collection. An excellent film.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is exactly what it was anticipated to be. At first, I thought this album would be like the last one, but when I heard it, I was blown away.  Its amazing the skill, talent, and vocals that this girl has.  I definitely recommend getting a copy, or maybe even 2. ;)
B000001FS3|5.0|i dont understand all these bad reviews of joshua tree. this album is in ever sense a masterpiece. i read a few reviews back that u2 was trying to make a \\"lavish living\\" off of political lyrics....???!!! Bono lives in a middle class neighbourhood and donates most of his money to charities and other foundations, get your head out of your ... buddy. Bizkit and Creed are not new and fresh, they are N'Sync with guitars  playing the same manufactured garbage. U2 are one of the best bands of the last 20 years. they managed to rise to the top int he 80's and are one of the VERY FEW bands that made the transition to the 90's and kept their sound fresh and relevant. Recognize good music when it comes along. buy the joshua tree right now if you dont own it and consider yourslef a  fan of real music.
0789723107|5.0|If you buy any book on website usability, this should be it. Have read Nielsen, Rubin and Rosenfeld/Morville. Out of all of them, this one was the best. Krug cuts to the chase by writing in non-techie terms. This makes the concept of usability a better sell to the uneducated.

0316776963|5.0|If you need to get away from the insanity happening in today's world...this book is for you. It will provide a haven of humor. Found this to be so enjoyable that I caught myself laughing out loud several times. The book is composed of short vignettes that recount Mr. Sedaris's life from child to adulthood. Everyone has childhood experiences that we would like to forget, as well as relatives that make us wonder if we're really adopted. Mr. Sedaris capitalizes on the quirkiness of both realms with his unique observations and dry wit. <br />I also read two of his other books &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; a great book to read this time of the year with the holiday just around the corner. It was another laugh-fest; and &quot;Naked&quot; which out of three, has some good stories but isn't as good as &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; and &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;.<br />I hope that Mr. Sedaris keeps the books coming...am looking forward to his next one!
B00006LIRI|5.0|U2&#146;s second greatest hits package stands in stark contrast to their first greatest hits album.  Listening to the two side-by-side, it almost seems as if they are two different bands.  The discrepancy in sounds shows how this band are truly gifted musicians.  The 1990&#146;s found the band sliding into the Alternative music scene with their first release of the decade, Acthung Baby.  That album is representing by the brilliant &#147;Mysterious Ways&#148;, &#147;Even Better Than The Real Thing&#148;, &#147;Until The End Of The World&#148; and the heartbreaking beautiful &#147;One&#148;.  The album and, in particular, &#147;One&#148; (which is about AIDS) showed they could adapt their music to modern styles, yet still make music with a message. Zooropa was their next and it really was an extension of Acthung Baby, but it moved them even more away from their main sounds.  Pop was a complete move into electronica and really sounds nothing like a U2 record.  Long time fans were displeased with the album and the press jumped all over the band.  While it is clearly the weakest album the band has made, they should be applauded for not standing still and have a willingness to experiment with new sounds.  They also did some movie soundtrack work in the 1990&#146;s with songs like &#147;Miss Sarajevo&#148; and the overlooked &#147;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&#148; from Batman Forever which is one of their best singles as well as contributing album tracks &#147;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&#148; and &#147;Until The End Of The World&#148; to soundtracks (One of the two new tracks &#147;The Hands That Built America&#148; is also from a movie, Martin Scorcese&#146;s Gangs Of New York).  In 2000, the band returned to a more traditional U2 sound with All That You Can&#146;t Leave Behind.  The album was universally hailed and produced the glorious &#147;Beautiful Day&#148; that won a slew of Grammys.  The album contains two new songs, but it also has new mixes of songs like &#147;Discotheque&#148;, &#147;Numb&#148; and others.  U2 is one of the biggest rock groups in the world, but they are constantly evolving their sound and refuse to rest on their laurels.  Not all of the sound changes they have attempted have worked, but they are constantly challenging their fans and keeping them entertained in the process.&#147;Discotheque&#148;, &#147;Numb&#148; and others.

B00006SFBD|5.0|...But then, I'm sure you weren't expecting me to say anything else, right? Every Opeth album presents a minor tweak to the style, but it's all been essentially the same stuff: Long, complex, stunningly beautiful death/doom/black/acoustic metal songs. I bought Deliverance the day it came out, and after several thorough listens, I can say it effortlessly lives up to the standards Opeth have set for themselves. <br />So what does this album sound like? Well, it sounds as though Michael's Bloodbath project has had some effect on his main band, because they've chosen to scale back the complex riffs and lush washes of sound in favor of a tighter, starker sound that recalls classic death metal pioneers like Morbid Angel and Obituary, while still oozing tons of Opeth personality. The softer acoustics and clean vocals are still present, of course, but instead of blurring the lines between them, like they did on the last two albums, Opeth have chosen to play up their contrasts.<br />And it works. I mean, it really works. It's so good that words fail me -- But then, that's how it always is with Opeth, right? \\"Deliverance\\" probably won't sway the legions who claim \\"Morningrise\\" or \\"Still Life\\" as the best Opeth albums, but the old \\"best Opeth\\" question is beside the point. If you like Opeth, of course you need this album. If you've never heard Opeth, but you find yourself reading this review, I have no doubt you'll love them, and \\"Deliverance\\" is as good a place to start as any -- Particularly for old-school death metal fans.
B00006M183|5.0|As a die-hard Pearl Jam fan, I've been waiting in anticipation for this CD for months now and boy was it worth every second!  I had already heard some of the songs (ie. Can't Keep & Thumbing My Way) from one of the previous concerts, but was surprised to hear how different they sound on the record.<BR>It's truly a great musical work ... but then again, I've thought that of every Pearl Jam song ever released.  I'm certain that if you are a Jam head you wont be disappointed.  If you aren't, don't expect the whole CD to be \\"I am mine\\" material or you will be very upset.<br />5 STARS!
B00006V9A0|1.0|Well, well, well.<br />  How sad.  Yes, sad.  Good thing this isnt the only &quot;new&quot; thing coming out by Nirvana(lol).  Ok, I love this band.  My favorite band ever and am a huge fan of Kurt's stuff (HUGE FAN!).  But this is so sad.  &quot;Hey, lets take everything you have heard and or are tired of hearing on the radio (plus one new track) and rip the fans off. Now, it is up to us to buy it, but lets face it.  Chances are, you have a friend or know of one who has 1 or more Nirvana cds. Chances are, you like more than just the singles.  And, Chances are, like me, you have downloaded You Know You're Right, off the internet.  So now I ask,  &quot;Why do you want this cd?&quot;  Thats like taking a Fender Strat, adding a new coat of the same color paint and going &quot;Hey Look, its NEW!&quot;
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Steven Spielberg's E.T. was a phenomenon when it was originally released in 1982.  The film wracked up huge ticket sales and became the highest grossing movie of all time.  The story appeals to young and old alike and it is a movie that parents can watch with their children and both will be equally entertained.  The story focuses on the relationship forged between young Elliot and E.T., an alien stranded on earth.  Along with his older brother and younger sister, they hide E.T. from the mother and try to find a way for E.T. to get back home.  Both Elliot and E.T. grow to love one another and even though Elliot doesn't want E.T. to leave, he knows that E.T. must get back to his own planet.  Henry Thomas gives one of the best performances by a child actor in movie history.  He portrays Elliot with real feelings, not just some teary-eyed kid who whines throughout.  His performance is layered and has real depth.  Seven-year old Drew Barrymore is cute as Gertie and the scene where she first sees E.T. is priceless.  Mr. Spielberg has called the film the most personal of his career and Elliot is clearly his alter ego.  Mr. Spielberg re-released the movie in 2002 to mark its 20th anniversary and he remastered and reworked the picture.  The main part of the updates involve making E.T. more life like.  In the new version, he has more motion and movement.  Some things like a line about Elliot looking like a terrorist and guns in Federal Agents hands have been changed (his mother says he looks like a hippie and the agents carry walkie-talkies now).  The film looks visually better, but the changes that are made seem like corrections, not enhancements.  Stick with the original 1982 release that is on disk two for the definitive version of the film.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|Anyone who is looking at this page I am assuming is a fan of MetallicA.  This is a DVD of their performance of the live album S&amp;M.  If you have ever heard the album before then you know that it is very different from any other album they have ever made.  I am not sure if this is for all MetallicA fans, the name S&amp;M stands for symphony &amp; MetallicA, yeah they play their songs being backed up by a Symphony.  The DVD is just the performance being taped.  It definitely helps the music if you can see Lars out there beating on the drums, instead of just imagining it all the time.
B00006M183|5.0|since everyone's been waiting for the next Ten, PJ comes up and DELIVERS, only it's not TEN, it's better, diverse, and F ing &quot;a,&quot; it's better.<br />Rock n Roll my friends and wide open, then tight, beautiful and SHUT YOUR MOUTHS now &quot;ten fiends&quot; they delivered.<br />1. Can't Keep : a rolling vedder song, haunting yet rocking<br />2. Save You : even flow anyone? forget it, best rocking song on the album, a dirty riff and thankless lyrics<br />3. Love Boat Captain: This song hit me much like Radiohead's Pyramid Song, organed out and wide open, yet feels like you are slowling paddling into the dock at the end of the song, much like a long journey.<br />4.Cropduster: say hello to the scale riffs, wonderful. The ol' &quot;I'm not one with the world&quot; eddie sings about his place in the world with fat power chords behind him.<br />5. Ghost: fast paced, scary.....rock n roll again<br />6. I am Mine: most complete song on the album, already a hit, much like betterman was, but a much different song<br />7. Thumbing My Way: even in the cd packet Eddie looks like neil young, and you can definitely hear a bit of the influence, heard this song was recorded when the band didn't even know....<br />8. You Are: gotta love cameron for giving them new ideas, putting the guitars through the drum machine definitely brings in a new sound, beautiful flowing chorus<br />9. Get Right: ROCK N ROLL..thank you !<br />10.Green Disease: the same again, mr. MFC stand tall, in the vein of rearviewmirror<br />11.Help Help: Ament always gets the oddly disquieting songs onto the ablum, the chorus only reverberates, &quot;help me&quot; over and over.............i shake<br />12. Bushleaguer: Eddie finally gets his spoken word song to sound listener friendly<br />13. 1/2 full: wowieeeee..........ROCK N ROLL? very solo based, what Rival would have been if it was unleashed<br />14. ARC: remember vitalogy's little snippet songs? insert here<br />15. All or none: and like they always do, PJ ends with a &quot;ballad&quot;......thank you, just plain out thank youquot;......thank you, just plain out thank you
6305807086|5.0|This is the kind of film that can restore your faith in American cinema. That it was even produced is a miracle, let alone received Oscar nominations. Unjustly deprived of the award for Best Original Screenplay (losing to \\"American Beauty\\"), Charlie Kaufman's magnificently absurd story works on so many levels: as surrealist fantasy, as a critique of our fascination with fame, as an acid inquiry into gender, power games and sexual manipulation, and, more simply, as just one hell of a funny trip. What's particularly impressive is that despite his story being relentlessly and increasingly ludicrous, Kaufman manages to tie-up all the loose ends and deliver an ending which is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious. He also gives us some of the funniest lines ever spoken on screen, to wit: 'Behind the stubble, the too prominent brow, and male pattern baldness, I sensed you feminine longing.' Spike Jonze extracts near-perfect performances from his high-calibre cast, with Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener cleverly playing against type, and John Cusack showing his incredible versatility. Three cheers for originality and having the courage to follow it through.
B000065V41|1.0|I am very disapointed with this dvd and also Muppet Treasure Island...both of which Disney chose not to release in widescreen at all.  These are Full Screen only movies in their current DVD form.  I can just watch the VHS copies I ahve if I wanted Full Screen.  The other Muppet movies published by Columbia/Tristar contain both widescreen and full screen, so I don't know why these are not in widescreen.  I will hold out on buying them until they are, however.
B00000IQMT|5.0|The music is the best thing about the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels because John Williams succeeds where George Lucas has failed abysmally. Rather than jettisoning his old work in some obsessive pursuit of innovation, Williams moves forward while reworking key elements of the original scores to create the thematic connections Lucas's plodding writing cannot possibly secure. He doesn't just duplicate his work from the original trilogy - he transposes aspects of it into an entirely new register, both musically and emotionally. \\"Anakin's Theme\\" adapts the old Imperial March into a new key, in a neat foreshadowing of Anakin's fate. While \\"Duel of the Fates\\" is not only a chilling backdrop to a lightsaber battle; its choral references to 'Carmina Burana' and other German masterworks help activate latent fears about the evils of our own time.  Williams really knows what he's doing here - he seems to be the only member of the prequel crew who does. The result is music which is beautiful, intelligent and stunningly effective. If only he wrote screenplays, too...
B00006LIRI|5.0|I just received it. Overseas.<BR>On the other side of the world.<BR>Its great. <BR>Eventhough I already new the selection of songs, it was very strong to see them all together on a CD. <BR>The B-sides are great. Already known versions with new ones.<BR>It is just a new example of how U2, even with old songs, can still surprise. Always gives you something.<BR>Here I am at work. As I said...stuck in a Cd I can get out of...<BR>I feel Numb.
B00006BTCA|4.0|While the rarer hackneyed comparsion to Joy Division may plague this band,  I find this to be an excellent revisit to early 80's post-punk.  Essentially unpretensious and sonically rich, Interpol brings bands like Wire and, yes, later Joy Division to mind.  Still, there is a lack of variety in sound that one could never have accused Joy Division of.  While Joy Division blazed trails in the early parts of three genres--punk, post-punk, and gothic rock--Interpol clearly has a set sound.  If I have any complaint about this album is that so much of it is similiar in sound.  It's good, very good; especailly in an age that seems to pride itself on going to the roots of garage rock.  If we are going to revisit any dated popular music period, I'd much prefer where Interpol is headed to where the Strokes are.
B00006M183|5.0|With this music out these days it's kind of hard to look forward to a quality cd release. Well we have had 2 in the past 2 weeks, the new Nirvana album and now the new Pearl Jam album. This is a must buy for any Pearl Jam fan, or for any fan of rock that wants to listen to something else than music about hate and beating up everyone (KORN, Limp Bizkit, any other poser of NU METAL), why can't any kid really listen to real music, do they have to listen to pre manufactured pop and rock ? If you want to really listen to a new album that is good, get Riot Act. Every song has a real meaning and songs with a singer that sings with passion. Get riot act now.
B00006LLLN|5.0|We saw this concert in Fort Worth, Texas, in May, and AKUS again in July(?) at the Down From The Mountain tour in Dallas, TX. We have all her albums (except Forget About It -- not quite the same as the other albums - more mainstream than Bluegrass). It's great to have AKUS live. I just wish I had a Sony DVD player that played SACDs, because this album is also on SACD. But, I'll get the DVD in the Spring, which will be DD 5.1 or DTS 5.1/6.1. Beautiful!
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult's ability to keep reader's on the edge of their seat left me unable to put this book down! I absolutely loved it!<br />I have never read anything by Picoult until now and I definitely will read more in the future. <br />The Pact was amazing. I could relate to many aspects of the novel and each event left me thinking. The story makes you wonder how life could be so perfect and then change in an instant. Picoult uses great detail in showing the love between two teenagers and how their once close famalies become split apart, left with a mystery of one child dead and the other accused of murder.<br />This book truly touched me and I would strongly reccomend it for readers who enjoy the strength of love and the search for truth.
B000059TPN|5.0|I am referring to the criterion collection. The movie here is revamped with beautiful sound, unbelievable color, and nice features. Although the movie is, as was pointed previously, lack of any artistic value, the adrenalin rush you get out of it is very high. This is further hightened by the brilliant sound.<br />Buy it only if you love the movie. Use this to test your home theater system to the limits. And to show-off what great sound system you have.
B0000203YT|2.0|I thought the movie will be so much better, I had red the great reviews about it and I was very disappointed by this movie \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", it was most of the time very boring.  The only thing I like was the beautiful costumes, dresses and atmophere of the moive but for the script it was pretty bad.When Gwenette Paltrow play Romeo she can't fool anybody and when she was acting it was pretty bad her voice had no tonation and was bad.  She look fabulous in her beautiful dresses that's what was good about her, her acting was not great, just okay.  I usually like her she is a good actress but this time her acting was boring.Also seeying all the time Shakespeare and her in bed reciting some part of the play was boring and sometime they both get really much in my nerves.I don't say don't rent the movie, you may like it, it was not that bad but I was pretty disappointed by it, I thought it will be much better!
B00004YA66|5.0|If you are a father, this movie makes you want to go hug your kids.
B00000AFDW|4.0|Dont pay attention to what the older kiss fans will say about this album, they just cant stand the fast that the band has a new much heavier metal sound, which in my opinion is a better thing for this band.  Because if they were still singing soft songs like Beth and Great Expectations in the 90s, they would have no new fans from the era raised on Glam Rock and Metal.  Consequently with that being said, this is EXACTLY the album that attracted me to KISS in the first place (heh), I first heard the flagship title for this album, Psycho Circus, on Fox's now-canceled Series Millenium and thought it was the best thing I heard in a few years, afterwords I learned of the Psycho Circus album and the rest is history, bringing me to my 12+ collection of KISS cds.  This album has strong heavy metal and should at least have a second look before its trashed by bias.
B0000004F9|5.0|I had third-row tickets to see Jimi Hendrix at the Virginia Beach Dome.  But of course we had to suffer through some unknown opening act first, a trio called &quot;The Soft Machine&quot;.<br />After the Soft Machine got through with us, Hendrix was an anti-climax!  There was Kevin Ayers on bass guitar and vocals, Mike Ratledge on organ (with some extra sounds built in-first time I'd ever heard fuzz organ before), and up front was drummer and lead singer Robert Wyatt.  The organ and bass were on a higher level behind Robert, who actually led the band.  <br />They began their set, and played without a break for something like an hour and fifteen minutes, doing smooth transitions from one song to the other so that it came off like a suite of songs.  Their musicianship was astonishing!  And their music was so unlike anything I'd heard before (or since), that I was absolutely blown away!  They quit, and the lights came back up, and as I looked around, I saw others with their mouths hanging open and their eyes wide, just as mine were.  There was a moment or two of complete silence as people gathered their wits and came back down to earth.  Then a standing ovation!  We were completely wrung out.  <br />I didn't know how much of what they did was planned and how much was improvised, but when I bought their first album, I was amazed to hear that the record was a short version of the concert that I had been lucky enough to see.  A true psychadelic journey!  <br />Hendrix did the smart thing when he came on.  He left the lights on, and started slow, doing an intimate version of &quot;Red House Blues&quot; while smoking a cigarette, giving us time to recover, and slide into his vision of reality bit by bit.  <br />Volume two is a logical extension of volume one.  A bit jazzier, a bit more refined sound-wise than volume one, which was a bit on the raw side from time to time.  But it's a further look at the same musical vision, and a unique one at that.  The two albums work together well as a musical unit.<br />This is not background music, it is not dance music.  It is not music that you listen to casually.  It's music that will take you on an emotional journey if you give it a chance.  It's somewhat free-form, not adhering to conventional song structures or chord progressions, but they used a lot of jazz and rock elements to make a music vision that was theirs and theirs alone.  <br />If you have time and a reasonable attention span, give the Soft Machine a chance to show it to you.  But please don't do as one clueless reviewer did, and judge a body of music from just listening to a few brief clips.  That's ridiculous!<br />After their third album this group lost me.  As much as I loved their music, they moved into personal avenues of expression that I was no longer able to share.  Some songs sounded to me as if they inadvertantly recorded the time they spent tuning and doing sound checks and put that on the record instead of the songs.  But the first two Soft Machine albums, and much of the Third, still shine as gems, as unique today as they were in the late sixties.  Nothing like it before or since.
B0000696ID|5.0|What can you say about a masterpiece. One of the truely inspiring movies that have changed and directed the lives of the kids from the 80's and the general populus of the world, time and time again. The movie is timeless. The bonus features make the movie even better, from the commentary of the actors, to the marketing material used (remeber the ET toys) <br />Thumbs Up
6300273016|4.0|A look back at the 60's, and a glimpse into the life of rock's bad boy Jim Morrison, this hour long tape is based on the Danny Sugerman/Jerry Hopkins bio, \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\".<br />The authors are interviewed extensively, as well as producer Paul Rothchild, and the other Doors: John Densmore, drums, Robbie Krieger, guitar, and Ray Manzarek, keyboards.<br />This is a rough sketch of Morrison's life, with many gaps (for instance, there is not even a still shot of Pamela Curson, who he called his \\"cosmic mate\\"), but is nonetheless interesting. He comes off in the interviews as totally spaced, and somewhat the naive innocent...a child in a gorgeous man's body, which with the added lure of stardom, must have presented some gigantic problems.<br />By contrast, the other 3 Doors seem down to earth, and serious...and while they were busy making music, Morrison was experimenting with life itself, even to go as far as sometimes messing up the performances. He \\"packed 50 years of living\\" in 27 years, and left us a sizable musical and poetic legacy.<br />The song clips include:<br />\\"Back Door Man\\" and \\"Crawling Kingsnake\\".<br />From the Ed Sullivan Show: \\"People are Strange\\" and \\"Light my Fire\\".<br />The clip from Apocalypse Now that uses \\"The End\\" in its soundtrack.<br />And shown in their entirety are \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"Touch Me\\".<br />The tape ends with this quote from 1969: \\"Let's just say I was testing the bounds of reality. I was curious to see what would happen. That's all it was: Just curiosity\\".
1587990717|5.0|I read a lot of books in non-fiction, books related to finance, economics, popular science, history. I have no doubt in saying that this is one of the best books I read in my life! <br />Taleb's iconoclastic views are not just about financial markets, a field he is well-versed with, but question perhaps the whole of current social order. In a world of uncertianty where much depends on chance events, success often is not about survival-of-the-fittest, but survival-of-the-luckiest. All of us understand pay- offs, in so far as they are more visible and can be measured easily, much better than risk. Besides we all love simple explanations for a complex phenomena. Poor understanding of risk coupled with penchant for over-simplification results in a culture that celebrates all success and victories, of whatever variety, in equal measure. <br />Taleb's writing style has intensity and depth, and his unconventional, but theoritically sound, views make this yet another book on the over-written field of financial markets a gem. Anybody who makes a living in hyper-competitive walk of life, specifically financial markets, will either love or hate Taleb, but won't ignore him. <br />Taleb doesn't spare anybody who don't follow what they preach, be it celebrity fund managers or nobel laureates! It seems that a lot of efficient-market-hypothesis enthusiats are wannabe active money managers who couldn't make it!<br />I don't expect this book to top any popularity charts, but then in a Talebian world what is too popular must also be mediocre too!
B000000W5P|3.0|There are really 3 stand out tracks here.  (guess which ones).  The rest are filler.  I think the next 2 albums Emotional Rescue and Tattoo You are better.  You can find the good songs on any hits compilation.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I give it up for this cd. It had a lot of artists on it...which i was truley surprised I thought Em would try to take all the credit! The songs that i was really feelin on this cd were 8 miles and runnin -Jay Z Lose yourself-eminem Wanksta-50 cent Rap Game-D12 and U wanna B Me-Nas
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire is definitely one of my all-time favorite superhero movies. I wasn't certain what to expect of the film, particularly being a huge Spider-Man fanatic as a kid who was hooked on the cartoon. This film pleasantly met all of my expectations as a Spider-Man fan and as a novelist and screenwriter. It is a wonderful story about young Peter Parker who is bitten by a high powered genetically enhanced spider, which transforms him from a nerd into the crime fighting, web spinning Spider-Man. The main storyline is accompanied by a touching subplot that involves the childhood love of Peter's heart, Mary Jane(MJ) played by Kirsten Dunst. As these two storylines interweave, Peter expresses his long overdue affection for MJ in dramatic fashion by springing to her rescue as the high flying superhero. As in all superhero stories, it would not be a good story without a formidable adversary. No one could have played the role of the &quot;Green Goblin&quot; better than Willem Dafoe, who gave an absolutely superb performance. This film pulls the viewer into a nail-biting conclusion as the Goblin and Spider-Man clash in the finale, bringing the audience to a breathtaking and satisfying climax. I recommend this feature to all Spider-Man fans and to those who enjoy a good story. Kudos!
B00001W9G0|5.0|The critics had a field day when this was released:  &quot;Barbra acts her head off&quot;  And they were right.<br />A simple story, beautifully photographed and lovingly acted, The Way We Were captures your heart.  You can't help but feel that Streisand and Redford are close friends of yours.  Every line, gesture and action on their parts rings true.<br />No technical wizardry or special effects (save for a beautifully remastered tape) are used or really needed.  Barbra never looked lovlier.  The 40's style made people finally forget about Barbra's unique look and realize that she is as beautiful as her voice . . . And What A Voice!<br />The title song is captured and you understand why it won the Academy Award and became one of her biggest hits.<br />In total, this is a timeless movie that any serious collector should own.
B000060MWU|5.0|I've been waiting for over a year and still no US. release for this DVD. I decided to purchase the German version from Amazon.de and not knowing any German I was nervous. What I did during the ordering process was to cut and paste all text from the German site and convert it through an online text converter. Now I'm a proud owner of Lost Highway on DVD!! The German version of Lost Highway has excellent sound quality and the picture is perfect. Be warned you must have a multi-region DVD player for this to work on or use your PC-DVD.
B000021Y77|5.0|As soon as I heard about this movie I had to go out and rent it...this turned out to be a great decision.  I watched it 3 times in one weekend and it is now one of the crowning jewels in my DVD collection.  <BR>Lola is an amazing chacter, who is very easy to empathize with.  with one phone call at the beginning of the movie she is thrown into a dizzying situation which requires her to act entirely based on wit and instinct; she has 20 minutes to get 100,000 marks or her boyfriend, Manie, is a dead man.  <BR>the short time frame evicts raw emotion from Lola,  and she goes thru every obsticle presented to her quickly with no time or patience for anything that gets in her way.   the things we get to see are Lola's split second reactions, along with how small differences in her encounters (down to what words a woman uses to curse at Lola) affect not only her outcome, but the future of the other people in the encounter.  the use of flash forward still frames gives you a glimpse into these character's changed lives, and does so effectively while not slowing down the movie.  There are some scenes, not in the 20 minute timeline,  that give an in depth look at  the characters.    My favorite of these is a scene with Lola  and Manie where they have a \\"how do you know you love me\\" conversation that establishes the depth of their relationship without being over the top or weakening the characters. the movie is WONDERFUL.   <BR>Personal recomendation:  watch the german version with subtitles, it's the best way to get a real feel for the characters and their reactions...the english dubbed version is nowhere near as effective and is even comical on occasions where what you're hearing and seeing just don't mesh.
1573226521|1.0|It s-u-c-k-s, but is fabulous if your into superficial plots, guts and vomit. I give it 5 stars in shock fiction, sensationalism and anything to sell books mentality.<br />Oh, and did you know that Alex \\"how else can I mis respresent Gen. X\\" Garland did not even visit Thailand before he wrote this book, dispite what he has repeated in many interviews.<br />Its a throw together, boring, sickening, childish piece of hack, and its a testement to the generation, to which I belong, that it was such a hit. It's fame to me is something akin to pompous people who expound endless metephors to look like they know art, when all they are looking at is a urinal... get it?<br />So, if you feel like wasting money, reading about people pooing on themselves and wait 235 pages for a plot to develop... go for it. <br />Don't say I didn't warn you:)
B0000029J5|5.0|Great CD.  Keb Mo ought to be a superstar and this CD proves that.<BR>If only the rest of the world knew!
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam is back with a vengeance, with some similar things, but a much different alblum than ever before.  There are some great, mature songs on this alblum like \\"Cropduster,\\" \\"Love Boat Captain\\" and \\"I am Mine.\\"  Great stories go along with these songs and actually there is a recurrent \\"love\\" theme on various songs.  There are also modern day topics on the alblum such as in the song \\"Ghost\\" where Eddie sings \\"The TV she talks to me, breaking news and building walls, selling me what I don't need...\\" The ironic thing about this, is we all have been thinking a similar thing I believe in watching some of the news recently when getting news reported to us on such stories as the girl missing in Utah, the sniper in DC and the Taliban.<br />There are some individual highlights as well, such as Matt Cameron's kick beat in \\"Cropduster\\" and \\"Green Disease\\" and the guitar work of Gossard and McCready in \\"I am Mine\\" and \\"1/2 Full.\\"  \\"1/2 Full\\" is actually a great rock song that just rolls along. Eddie Vedder does a top notch job in the acoustic \\"Thumbing My Way\\" that is just a beautiful song with great lyrics as well.<br />There is great production on the alblum, as well as good work by the entire band. Everyone dabbed a little in either the music and/or lyrics.  There are a couple of songs that are not as solid as the others like \\"Bushleaguer\\" and \\"Help Me.\\"  Even these two do have some highlights however. Good closing to the record with \\"All or None.\\" Just turn up the record and enjoy.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I have to speak up.  This is not my favorite Diana Krall album, and - with all due respect to Bruce Weber - I'm a little put off by the photographic overkill in this CD package.  But, big deal - so someone had a funky idea about how she should be marketed - it's been done since the earth cooled - and it makes her no less an artist.<BR>As for Diana Krall's musical talent, I don't see how it can be questioned. She has a style, and she interprets music within that style.  Her melodic and lyrical sensitivity is amazing, her rhythmic sense is impeccable, AND she's doing all this while plunking out some very tasty stuff on the keys... <BR>Jazz is every bit as much about the silence between the notes as it is about the notes.  If Diana Krall isn't the singer you want her to be, music fan, then listen to Sinatra sustain his notes (which he does very nicely) and get off her case.  <BR>Right now, I'd rather gear down and listen to an artist giving me consistently lush, complex and textured interpretations of great music.  This album gives me that in spades - &quot;S'Wonderful&quot;, &quot;I Remember You&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; are particularly delicious.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Until now, the closest any CD set has ever gotten to surveying Elton's entire career in the U.S. was the limited edition \\"To Be Continued\\" box set released in 1990 and then reissued for a short period 10 years later (among other things, you can read about the box set in my book, \\"His Song:  The Musical Journey Of Elton John,\\" from Billboard Books and available for purchase right here on amazon.com).  The two CDs-- plus bonus-- in this latest collection go further, if for no other reason than that they take the listener up through 2002. In the case of both \\"To Be Continued\\" and \\"Greatest Hits 1970-2002,\\" Elton is captured in transit from one great achievement to the next. And as we did in 1990, in 2002 we find Elton John as productive as ever and as poised as ever to surprise us with his new creations.<br />One may quibble with the song choices. Fans had concerns about the \\"To Be Continued\\" package, which at least had some rarities, such as the \\"Your Song\\" demo and a live version of \\"I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun of Robert Ford).\\" But what makes \\"Greatest Hits 1970-2002\\" stand out is its ability to synthesize a varied and prodigious career in just the two main CDs. You get most of Elton's Top 10 hits, beginning with \\"Your Song\\" (while some are omitted, such as 1979's \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\" and 1974's \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\"). You also get songs that have never before been included as a studio recording on a Greatest Hits package: 1988's number two hit \\"I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like that,\\" the other A-side on the double A-sided best-seller \\"Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About The Way You Look Tonight,\\" the 1999 duet with LeAnn Rimes on \\"Written In The Stars\\" from Broadway's then soon-to-be hit musical \\"Aida,\\" and two choice morsels from Elton's latest and perhaps greatest album, \\"Songs From The West Coast.\\"<br />For the devoted fan, this package provides a convenient way to hear some of Elton's most famous songs without skipping from CD to CD, and a good read in the narrative written by longtime Elton friend and commentator Paul Gambaccini that is included in the 40-page booklet. For the casual fan, these CDs offer a stunning introduction into the wonders of Reg from Pinner and, most likely, will turn many a casual fan into a devoted fan. For Elton novices, the Gambaccini essay will be a true revelation and the pictures of all of Elton's album covers will offer an irresistible temptation to pick up some of those other collections.<br />The U.S. bonus CD only includes four tracks, while the UK version boasts nine, but either way, the four-track bonus CD really is a bonus for U.S. music fans, most of whom won't have heard the soul-filling 1996 \\"Live Like Horses\\" duet with Pavarotti or the riveting \\"Your Song\\" duet with Alessandro Safina from the summer of 2002.<br />As a final note, while many of the pictures in the accompanying booklet have been seen before, they haven't necessarily been seen before by a devoted fan who is not a manic collector, and few will have been seen before by the casual fan. In any case, the pictures are, like the songs, an inspiring look at the songwriter, performer and man called Elton Hercules John, through all phases of his career.d a good read in the narrative written by longtime Elton friend and commentator Paul Gambaccini that is included in the 40-page booklet.

B00003CXAA|5.0|I got this movie about 6 months ago. I believe that one way or another I did watch the movie more then 4 times. This is not becasue the story is thrilling. The way the Director made this move is really attempting to watch. There are also Marlon Brando, Al Paccino making the move really attractive. There are many important notes that apply to the real life as well. Sometimes I got the feeling that the movie changed my way of thinking and behaving.
B000002ILG|5.0|Hair Band... yes they certainly are.  For many reasons this album transcends the entire genre of hair band.  Lyrics & Music are really above their normally \\"lame\\" catagory.  I can't see someone not loving this album.
B00006M183|1.0|What a HORRIBLE album!!!  I LOVE Pearl Jam, and have for quite some time.  I have most of the 2000 tour Bootlegs, all of the studio albums and a majority of the singles as well.  I know that \\"Binaural\\" is not everyone's cup of tea, but I found many of the songs to be quite memorable and enjoyable.  For example, \\"Insignificance\\" is a wonderful song and \\"Grievance\\" is just spectacular.  This is what \\"Riot Act\\" is lacking.  One definitive song.  One song that you want to go and play again.  One song that makes the album worthwhile.  \\"Binaural\\" had several, and so do all of the previous albums, but this album doesn't.  It drones on like a funeral dirge until it is over.  I actually found myself wanting this album to be over, but each time I felt that way, another droning song came on.  Eddie Vedder holds back with his vocals, NEVER once sounding like he cares about what he is singing.  The rest of the band sounds out of it too.  It's almost like these guys put an album together just to get it out of the way.  <br />I couldn't give you any review of any particular song to tell you what I didn't like about it, because none of them stuck out in my mind.  There are ok songs on this album that aren't memorable and the rest of the album is just bad.  An album of total filler.  Let's just hope that the live renditions of these songs will be a little more memorable.<br />So, if you have Pearl Jam's other stuff, and you are a huge fan of the band, I would skip this one so that the magic that the other albums bring will not fade.  But if you are a completist, get the album.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B00000JMOJ|4.0|The Running Man tells of a future world where convicted fellons are put on a game show \\"The Running Man\\" and are placed in arenas along with psychotic stalkers who are there to kill these guys in record time all for the entertainment of the American people. <BR>The film is great but not perfect. I love the way the film portrays society, as basically a bunch of mindless and gullable media slaves. Which some would argue is true for our society today, where we believe everything served to us on television and radio, not considering that maybe the people behind these stories are money hungry, heartless liars. It was almost like a future version of the Roman Empire, where upper class Romans found the most violent and bloody sport with slaves getting butchered in an arena as pure entertainment. This film uses the likes of rich corporate adults as the shows mainstream audience loving fellons get butchered the same way.<BR>The films special effects are ahead of its time, with believable gore and movie props like futuristic cars and buildings.<BR>Richard Dawson is great as the gameshow's host, as a lovable teddy bear on screen, and a greedy, self-involved liar backstage. The remaining cast do thier jobs well, although they could have found more talented actors. Arnold is Arnold, without him, this movie wouldn't have the box-office appeal that it did, nor would it have the appeal on todays audience that it did. And even though his one liners after each death border on stupidity in this film (with a lot of the other dialogue), his Arnoldness simply makes up for it. <BR>This movie was a great and unique idea and it was executed just fine, I own this dvd and like it a lot. Although, giving us simply a trailer as an extra simply sucks. I wouldve like to hear some commentary on it at least. Oh well...
B000069AUI|5.0|A &quot;sophomore slump&quot; is something Coldplay definitely avoided with &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. This album is a clear step above their debut, retains everything good there was about &quot;Parachutes&quot; and, what's more, brings haunting, magical atmosphere that lasts from the very first song to the last.<br />At the same time modern and emotional (great achievement, as nowadays it is not 'cool' to express feelings), the album solidifies Coldplay's very own style, different from Radiohead and different from Travis. If a tangible similarity is left there between the three British groups, it is predominantly vocal expression of their singers, Chris Martin, Thom Yorke and Fran Healy, respectively.<br />The atmospheric music and arrangements are dominant over lyrics which basically reflect contemporary anguish of young adults and even try to hint at world events (&quot;Politik&quot;). What also makes this album stand out is its defying categorisation. While Brits are not shy to file Coldplay under pop, American critics usually place them under alternative or indie cap. But, does it really matter?<br />Indeed, opener &quot;Politik&quot; is as rocky as Coldplay can be, yet setting the mood beautifully. Particularly potent in keeping the magic alive are &quot;The Scientist&quot; with its groovy guitar licks and piano motive on &quot;The Clocks&quot;. Minimalist melody on &quot;Daylight&quot; reaches climax on chant-like ending &quot;...slowly breaking through the daylight...&quot; The most emotional moment is saved for &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, when Chris goes, with disarming sincerity: &quot;and the truth is, I miss you...&quot;. Sublime &quot;Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;Amsterdam&quot; display the band in a quiet, thoughtful mood, opposite to agitated &quot;Whisper.&quot;<br />In all, Coldplay have crafted an almost perfect album that improves with repeated listens. Admittedly, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; may not necessarily appeal to alllisteners, but one is inclined to agree with those who are overwhelmed by its emotional impact. Even though the elusive emotion would be hard to describe by words. You're not sure whether it's joy, euphoria, spell, peace or whatever. There is... just something about this one.
0792845684|4.0|Why is it that John Carpenter only makes decent movies when he has a small budget and foils up big time when he's given a Hollywood budget? ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is one of Carpenter's better movies. Sure, it's mindless entertainment. But it's good mindless entertainment without too much gore, sex, or profanity. This was the film that started Kurt Russell down the path to bigger box office dollars. It's also worth checking out for the opening scene where a hijacked plane crashes into a tall New York skyscraper. It's so eerily similar to September 11th, 2001 that it makes you wonder how much art really does imitate life, or is life now imitating art?
B00006M183|5.0|This Pearl Jam album reflects a maturity from the band, and it feels so good to know we still have Pearl Jam while we are bombarded with silly pop on the radio these days.  PJ fans should enjoy this one.
B000063147|5.0|This cd, in an essence, is amazing. I would be the first person to tell you that hardcore isn't my choice of music, and this cd STILL is nothing short of astounding. The five piece from California is capable of literally any kind of music they put their mind to. Throughout the \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" you will hear styles ranging from 80's metal to hardcore, and from punk rock to even a rock ballad featuring the vocalist M. Shadows on piano.<br />each member of the band is amazingly talented at their instruments, and it definitely shows on this album. On guitar, we have Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance. These two are better than 75% of guitarists making 100% more money these days. From the first song till the last song, you'll hear riff after solo after riff, each jaw-dropping in its own unique way. Next is Dameon Ash (replaced by Justin Sane) on bass. He's got the metal riffing down, but usually is drowned out by the guitars and (hella)awesome drums of The Reverend Tholomew Plague. If there's a drummer in this world that should be worshipped, it is this man. He is one of the fastest and most elaborate drummers in the punk/hardcore scene, and it definitely can not go unnoticed in \\"Trumpet\\". Lastly, but not least(ly), there is M. Shadows on vocals. He makes the band what they are. What are they? Nobody knows, actually. There's no real label you can put on them, and part of the reason is Shadows. He can go from straight glass gargling hardcore growling, to melodic emo singing, and polishing it off with Greg Graffin of Bad Religion styled punk rock harmonizing.<br />if you're in the mood for something new, and you're completely sick and tired of nickelback and good charlotte, you should definitely pick up Avenged Sevenfold's \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\".<br />best songs: darkness surrounding, lips of deceit, warmness on the soul, and shattered by broken dreams
6304712936|3.0|Having seen the original play on Broadway, and the movie years ago time allows some perspective. I was impressed like many here, but like so many movies today the facade does not hold up over time.  The casting of Tom Hulce as Mozart was dreadful.  That silly laugh has gotta go! In fact all of these American actors are pretty bad in this movie.  To see good 18th Century costumes and then hear flat American accents that sound like Madison Ave. is visually distracting.  This movie throws a lot at you with music, impressively staged opera scenes and a lot of over the top acting.  But in the end you are left with a sensational perspective of Mozart and his times, with little solid background.  The rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is certainly exaggerated for affect.  The idea is clever, but grating after a while.  This movie will appeal most to those who don't really know much about Mozart and classical music.  It makes him look like a punk rock star of the 18th century!  If the movie awakens interest in listening to more of his music than I suppose it will have served a good purpose, but as a historical portrait of the composers life it is a travisty.  A musical fantasy.  The DVD version I found disppointing as it does not really show any behide the scenes footage of how the movie was made
0156012197|1.0|First of all, this is my favorite book, ever, and gets five stars. When I'm very sad or going through a difficult time, reading this little book always cheers me up and makes me feel happy. It makes the world seem right again and makes me see with my heart. And it makes me cry in that very good way we all (those who cherish this book) love so much.<br />However, the new translation is simply dreadful, and gets one star. It somehow manages (with a few exceptions) to miss the charm of the original at every step. The original English translation, by Katherine Woods, is a classic, and Harcourt's attempt to \\"improve\\" it seems ill-informed and gratuitous to me. I see from a number of other reviews that I'm not the only one who feels this way, so I hope that Harcourt comes to their senses and goes back to the original before it's too late. I'd hate to think that future generations will know this book only by its new translation, and will never know how exquisite it was before that.<br />If you've never read this book or are going to buy a copy, please get an old one (Woods translation) so as to maximize your enjoyment while at the same time foiling Harcourt's dastardly plot to destroy a classic.
B00005RHGK|3.0|This movie start well and keeps you on the edge of your seat. However t does not make much sense overall. No explanation is given where the monster come frm, what it is, why it does what it does and so on. It just makes no sense. Special effects are excellent and the pace of the movie is up there with it's gender. Overall: FAIR.
6304711891|2.0|This review has nothing to do with the quality of the movie and everything to do with the quality of the DVD.<br />The 'widescreen' is really a fullscreen movie with matting (horizontal black bars) added at the top and bottom.  What does this mean?  MISSING CONTENT.  You just cannot enjoy the movie with this presentation.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam seems to have grown in their talent and virtue as musicians over the years. In RIOT ACT we see an aged group still at the peak and mastery of their craft. The album soars from beginning to end and the tightness of each guitar solo by Mike McCready, the swaying rythms of Stone Gossard as well as front man Eddie Vedder's vocals, take the listener to places both profound and exclusive in their sound. Songs like \\"I AM MINE,\\" \\"LOVE BOAT CAPTAIN,\\" \\"YOU ARE,\\" and \\"ALL OR NONE\\" still ring with the band's signature sound: explosive musical riffs mixed with passionate and volatile vocals. <br />Pearl Jam has matured into sage like musicians and have come a long way since the early 1990's. Their music has mellowed some what, and yet they're still as masterful as ever when they need to just jam. In RIOT ACT, Vedder's lyrics seem more comfortable and sentimental, as in the beautifully composed \\"THUMBING MY WAY.\\" And yet, Vedder still strikes at the political chords with songs like \\"BUSHLEAGUER\\" and \\"CROPDUSTER.\\" His voice is a bit subdued throughout most of the album, which might slightly disapoint the occational Pearl Jam listener, but to those who have followed the band since their 1991 debut TEN, it's a welcome sound and a wonderful alternative to all the \\"Vedder-Pretenders\\" that have saturated the air waves recently. He's still the captain of this ship and yet still knows when to step out of the way and let his gifted band mates take the reins of a song. <br />The band makes no apologies about the direction they've taken musically as the only seemingly radio-friendly song \\"I AM MINE\\" is still vastly different from anything else in popular music today. Pearl Jam returns, not to reclaim their crown from pretenders-to-the-throne bands like Creed and Stained as is their right, but to simply perform great music. They've progressed in the ways other classic rock artists and song writers have and have nothing left to prove. They are masters of their craft and prove, onceagain, that there's more to rock than three chord, woe-is-me songs. In many ways, Pearl Jam has stripped away the \\"Alternative/Grundge\\" label and have come up out of the waters simply as incredible musicians and song writers as well as an unbelievable live act. This is their lasting legacy and RIOT ACT is a perfect compliment to this statement. It's not their best album, but it is a great one nonetheless.
B00005ATZT|2.0|This review has nothing to do with the quality of the movie and everything to do with the quality of the DVD.<BR>The case is cardboard, not a plastic clamshell.  As a result, it will deteriorate much more quickly and lose its aesthetic qualities.<BR>The 'widescreen' is really a fullscreen movie with matting (horizontal black bars) added at the top and bottom.

B00006SFBD|2.0|Why is this band so critically acclaimed?  All of the songs sound pretty much the same and you can't understand a word the &quot;singer&quot; is saying. Each song is like an overlong run-on sentence!
B00006AW2F|5.0|I forgot how much I loved this disc until I got the reissue. But F ME ! I canna only play it in the car. I can't get it ripped on my MAC thus I can't put it on my iPod thus again I can't play it wherever I want.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Without a doubt this is the most complete collection of Elton John's hits. It's also a must have for every record buyer. However, it could have been even better. This collection leaves out such hits as Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Mama can't buy you love, Chloe, Nobody wins, Friends, and several others.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have been checking the HBO site for months waiting for the release of Band of Brothers on DVD...my patience was rewarded. The boxed set is truly spectacular. What a tribute to the men of the 101st and all who fought it WWII.<br />I read Ambrose's book years ago so I was naturally drawn to the project when I heard about it.<br />Not being a HBO subscriber, I was forced to watch video copies in which the dialogue was often difficult to understand. The DVD set solves that problem easily.<br />I suggest reading the book first. There are many characters and the series does make it difficult to learn the names of many of the E Company soldiers, with the exception of the main characters: Winters, Guarnere, Malarkey, Lipton, Nixon, etc.<br />The music, too, is spectacular.<br />Well worth the price.
0767817478|1.0|This is not Godziila, perhaps a giant lizard attacking NYC, but those are two different things.<BR>I love the campiness, bad dubbing, and low tech effects of the early (real) Godzilla flicks but most of all I love the SPIRIT that those films were made with.<BR>This high-tech 1998 mis-named Godzilla movie is just a long string of computer effects, corporate sponsors and overall emptiness. No spirit or purpose (other than $$$) whatsoever.<BR>A product for the indiscriminate masses.
0792153367|4.0|The celebrated author on whose novel it was based despised the film version, describing it as &quot;mawkish.&quot;  The star wasn't much more enthusiastic; she never considered it among her best work.  And the reviews were mixed.  But regardless of what Truman Capote, Audrey Hepburn, or the critics thought about it, the public adored it--and the image of Audrey Hepburn wearing a black evening dress, nibbling pastry, and window shopping has passed into our cultural iconography.<br />The film is indeed lightweight stuff.  Audrey Hepburn is a New York good-time girl who makes a living by clipping her wealthy escorts for fifty here and fifty there.  When she meets handsome George Peppard--a writer who makes ends meet by trading favors with society matron Patricia Neal--can love be far behind?  But Audrey's mysterious past and her determination to marry rich, George's status as a kept boy-toy, and their occasionally questionable associates provide plenty of complications to fill out the story.<br />What makes the film work is the remarkable charm of its two stars.  Most of the attention goes to Audrey Hepburn and the film shows her to remarkable advantage: she is a remarkable actress, personality, and beauty, and she works wonders with the ultralight script.  But when it comes to charm, George Peppard is no slouch either: the film catches him at the height of his early golden-boy good looks, and he is the perfect foil for Hepburn in both their comic and dramatic scenes.  Mickey Rooney's excessive performance as Yunioshi aside, the supporting cast is also very entertaining, with Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Dorothy Whitney all give enjoyable turns.  The film looks great (make sure you get the widescreen version), the score (which includes &quot;Moon River&quot;) is excellent, and director Blake Edwards keeps everything moving at a pleasant pace.  This a great film to cozy up with on a cold night--romantic, entertaining, and as comforting as a cup of hot chocolate.  Recommended.chocolate.  Recommended.
0743216458|5.0|If you enjoyed the HBO miniseries, you need to purchase and read the book BAND OF BROTHERS. It is my personal favorite of Stephen Ambrose's works -- more personal and intimate than D-DAY: THE SIXTH OF JUNE and more physical, energetic, and gripping than CITIZEN SOLDIERS. <br />Two things make this book unique in war literature: 1) the emphasis on pre-combat training and the development of a unit's esprit de corps; and, 2) the attention paid to the postwar lives of the men who served. <br />As always, Ambrose's machine gun prose seizes your imagination with perfect historical details. Another historian might tell you that training was tough, only Ambrose knows that American paratroopers were more fit than the professional football players and prize fighters of their day (and that the athletes often served as physical training instructors for the troopers!). Another historian might tell you that the company commander survived the war and led a prosperous, peaceful life; only Ambrose lets you know that the same man raises geese but would never think of slaughtering them for food.<br />Stephen Ambrose made a unique contribution to the profession of history and to the United States of America because he was able, more than any other researcher, to elicit from the heroes of World War II the complete and candid accounts of their actions.<br />If you already have read BAND OF BROTHERS, I suggest than you turn next to Ambrose's PEGASUS BRIDGE, which recounts the daring and critical glider raid by British commandos the night before D-Day. <br />Another, little known book that any reader of BAND OF BROTHERS will treasure is WITH THE OLD BREED: ON PELELIU AND OKINAWA by Eugene Sledge. Sledge served with the Marines in the Pacific and endured some of the worst combat in the history of the world. He survived to write a compelling and unforgettable memoir.

0140186409|5.0|While Steinbeck's masterwork fit more perfectly into the era of recovery from the Great Depression, it addresses human interrelations in a most timeless fashion. Those of us who have discovered what it means to lose all (or nearly all) of our tangible possessions, as the Joads did, grasp a deeper meaner of life. The Joads demonstrate greater respect for fellow humans than for the clothes on their backs.<br />Steinbeck also provides an eloquent look at those who clawed their way to retain tangible wealth. These people wanted no part of sharing with folks in desperate need and Steinbeck demonstrates this through both the path of the Joads from Oklahoma to California as well as more general looks at the circumstances of the dustbowl's victims.
B00006LIRI|4.0|What a great compilation for the second half of U2's career!  Although in my opinion, I feel zooropa and pop are the band's weakest efforts, this cd manages to pull out the best tracks from both albums; further adding to the magnificent array of pop rock that is u2.  This is the perfect addition to the greatest hits set released a few years ago.<br />Now you can pop this baby in, and play it in order right after the first cd, for a truly gratifying experience.
B00006IR5S|5.0|While many of the favorite Harry Potter melodies are all too familiar, John Williams was able to build upon them to bring us an even grander soundtrack.  There are many melodies that will distinctly remind one of some of the classical composers of old, such as Bach or Wagner.  I also noticed a few that are reminiscent of some tunes from Williams' Indiana Jones &amp; the Last Crusade Soundtrack.  I think I enjoyed the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; Soundtrack even more than I did the original soundtrack from the &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;  If you are a fan of John Williams' music, this sountrack is a must have!
0451191153|4.0|As neither an atheist nor an objectivist I can still say that this is a very powerful novel.  Only because I have read Atlas Shrugged and know about the descent into cult like status which objectivism fell prevents me from giving this book 5 stars.  It's long and a bit dry, Ayn Rand is certainly not bathroom reading, but in the end worth the effort.  <br />My personal opinion on objectivism is probably a bit harsh; I consider it a parasitic ideology that can only survive in the comforting environs of a strong established democracy, but it is worth reading as reinforcement of certain principles; namely ambition and individuality.  I'm sure there are a lot of counter-culture kiddies that read this and Kafka or Kerouac and think they understand the world, hardly so.  An architect cannot stop a city nor can a copper magnate, a Swedish pirate and a philosopher ... grease monkey turn off the \\"engines of the world.\\"  I know who John Galt is and he is the bastardized interpretation of the ubermensche of Nietzsche's philosophy.  Pure objectivism would essentially be social Darwinism, survival of the smartest and most cunning, not something that depressed teenagers should be reading.  Never the less, I do agree with Ms. Rand that we are individuals.  We should drive ourselves to excel no matter the obstacles but, that said, the rest of society is not necessarily an Albatross around the neck.  We are not necessarily responsible for/to those less fortunate.  We should help them out of compassion, not obligation.  Mix in a little compassion and some reality into this book and it's worth reading and recommending.<br />P.S.  Stay away from Atlas Shrugged, it's the Fountainhead with renamed characters, an implausible plot (see Swedish pirate above) and a monologue at the end that would put Tolstoy to sleep.
B00006V9A0|4.0|I have been a Nirvana fan for quite some time now, and I couldn't wait to buy this CD. But when the track listing was posted on the internet, I was shock that the CD only contained 14 songs. I could have easily chosen many more songs to place on the CD. If this CD was meant to be a greatest hits collection, it definently was not. Nirvana was one of the greatest bands ever and they have more than 14 hits.<BR>   On a lighter note, I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because no matter what, the songs that actually were included on this CD are amazing. The songs themselves deserve 5 stars. After hearing many people comment on this CD, you can pick out the true Nirvana fans from the fans who really know anything about the band; because a true fan knows that this is by far a pathetic excuse of a greatest hits.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is awesome! Every single song(well, almost)on this album is A+! Best CD I got so far after summer. Definitly worth 15 bucks!
071484232X|5.0|Peter Trippi is to be commended for his beautiful new publication -- J W Waterhouse. It is a well researched text that includes Waterhouse studies, paintings and photographs not gathered together before for so many to enjoy. Peter carries forward the tradition of Anthony Hobson as he shares insights and information with all those who love the art of J W Waterhouse -- those insights and information are most appreciatively received.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I brought this CD because people told me it was good. It's okay, but...tell you the truth, IT ALL SOUND THE SAME!! Every single song sounded the same to me. But her voice is beautiful, so I'm happy that I got it.
B000059PR5|5.0|I remember the initial pre-broadcast hype for this movie.  It aired on a Sunday and everyone at church that day was asking &quot;Are you going to watch The Day After tonight?&quot; Most everyone we knew was planning on watching it.  My husband and I watched it and unlike most TV movies, it seared itself into my mind and the vivid images are still there today.  <br />Nearly twenty years later, I now live in the KC metro area.  We are within an hour drive of Whiteman AFB and Fort Riley AB, 10 minutes from a major armament manufacturer, and one of the world's largest communications corporations has it's headquarters nearby - in other words - we're still a prime target.  With all the goofballs in the middle east right now, the scenes from this movie still scare me because I know nuclear war is a very real possibility.<br />The actors all did a wonderful job and were totally believable.  I enjoy everything I've ever seen Jason Robards in.  He was a national treasure and added class to every film he graced.  <br />The special effects were terrific for their day and still hold up.  The movie effectively describes the aftermath of nuclear war, horrifyingly updating such cold war classics as &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot;.  However, I agree that the British movie &quot;Threads&quot; was much more terrible in it's depiction of atomic aftermath.<br />I can't say I enjoyed this movie.  How can you enjoy something that so frightens and depresses you?  But I highly recommend it.  Parts may be too frightening for younger children.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is just one of those movies you can watch over & over.  I've seen it dozens of times and I NEVER get tired of watching it. Lots of action (and blood) plus a great story.  Sure it's not entirely historically accurate, but who cares?  It's beautifully shot & has great acting.

B00006V9A0|5.0|People stole most of my old Nirvana CDs so I was just about ready for another dose. I really liked this. It was like a trip down memory lane.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Turn the lights down, light a candle, pour a glass of cabernet, and hang on for an amazing experience.  This CD reaches to the depths of my soul and touches me like few other have.  Norah Jones has a quality to her voice that just welomes you in and makes you want to listen.  &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is my top pick, speaking to the longing to leave all the worlds concerns behind and walk away with the one you love.  Every track is a winner, making this my favorite CD of the year.
6305897786|5.0|It has been a while since Roman Polanski has created a good movie.  In the Ninth Gate Polanski shows us that he still has the knack for turning out an attractive and interesting film.  The Ninth Gate is a neat razor cut out of a wonderful but convoluted book, The Club Dumas.  The concept of a banned book from the 17th century slowly emerges out of a quest to authenticate a part of The Three Musketeers.  <BR>In the Ninth Gate our mercenary \\"hero\\" played by Johnny Depp is immediatly put in harm's way with a charge to authenticate a book supposedly co-authored by the devil. Polanksi skillfully leads us into a suspensful mystery that mid-way through begins to get atmospheric and supernatural.<BR>What the movie does not do is toss buckets of blood into the viewer's face as a idiot's version of horror and suspense.  What the movie does do is lead one deeper and deeper into a eerie and scary world of ruthless people and the creepy thought that the book might actually be written by the Devil.  The music is at once beautiful and atmospheric. The supporting cast is perfect, especially Frank Langella who is haughty and villanous.  We are also treated to Emmanualle Seigner who let us think she is an angel, or a demon, or a familiar.<BR>The DVD version has a voice over commentary by Polanski who explains the ins and out of the film.  There is also a feature that singles out the music.  The DVD edition is crisp and clear.  <BR>Some have said that The ninth Gate displays Hitchcock style.  It actually shows Polanski style with a nod to Val Lewton.  It show us a character who increasingly has to look over his shoulder for fear of some dread fiend behind him.  But the fiend is allowed to live mostly in the viewer's mind and not in the viewer's eye.
B00006IUL7|4.0|From the time that Al Pacino became an international superstar with his gripping performance in \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" he has held film audiences in rapt attention with his inner intensity.  He often will not even say a word; the tension looms as a coil ready to spring.  Pacino generates interest, speaking or silent.<br />In \\"Insomnia\\" Pacino plays a well known but highly troubled Los Angeles detective assigned with partner Marty Dawson to travel to a small Alaskan town to help solve a murder which has local police baffled.  When he arrives Pacino is overwhelmed when energetic rookie officer Hilary Swank, determined to be the best in her profession, idolizes him to the point of knowing his cases and even notable quotes, in the manner of a baseball fan knowing the statistics and famous games of a favorite player.<br />Alaska is known for its seemingly interminable alternating periods of sun and darkness.  Pacino arrives during the sun period.  As a result, he finds it impossible to sleep.  As the story develops we learn that it is more than the sun, however, bothering Pacino.  His own past and present career as an officer reside in indefinite turmoil.<br />Pacino is in Alaska to solve the murder of an attractive 17-year-old girl.  When suspicion shifts from her abrasive, physically abusive high school boyfriend to a local older pulp mystery writer, the story heats up.<br />When Pacino and police cohorts are seeking to corner the murder suspect in a field shrouded in fog, Pacino unleashes a shot and kills his partner.  He is happy to leave the impression that the retreating suspect killed his Los Angeles police sidekick, but his world is jolted when, during one of his many sleepless nights, he receives a call from the detective writer, who reveals that he saw Pacino fire the shot that killed his partner.<br />Robin Williams, who made his mark in rollicking comedy, turns in a superb effort as the troubled writer who believes that, by making a compact with Pacino, they canboth emerge free of suspicion.  The wily but troubled Williams theorizes that all Pacino needs to do is direct suspicion back to the boyfriend, pretend to solve the case, and return to Los Angeles, leaving him unscathed with a patsy being convicted of the crime.  He explains that he did not really mean to kill the young woman anymore than Pacino meant to kill his partner.  Accordingly, they should both be free of any taint of guilt. <br />The picture and the blackmail offer from Williams becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Pacino was being investigated by the internal affairs department in Los Angeles and believed his own partner would be a crucial element in bringing him down.  So did he or did he not kill his partner deliberately?  Does Pacino ultimately know?<br />The imaginative script by Hilary Seitz keeps viewers guessing until its conclusion.  Swink, a recent Best Actress Oscar winner, does a superb job as the gung ho small town Alaska police officer who begins figuring things out on her own pertaining to both Pacino and Williams.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard.  Critics of the lack of song titles, album title, and a real language have a point, but they don't seem to understand that Sigur Ros's intent is to have everything completely focused on the music, and they have done an extremely good job.  Tracks 1, 4, 6, and 8 are my favourites.  If you liked Agaetis Bryjun and Von, you won't be disappointed with ( ).
B00004RJ74|5.0|Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay to this tribute to B-grade horror films which had Robert Rodriguez at the helm.  Tarantino and George Clooney star as the Gecko Brothers; two looney outlaws on a crime spree that kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Lieu) to get across the Mexican border and are to meet an accomplace at a seedy bar.  But little do they know that this bar is overrun with vampires, and this is where the fun begins.  Honestly to all of those giving From Dusk Till Dawn a bad review have either never seen it or are still whining about the success of Pulp Fiction; From Dusk Till Dawn is a tribute to B-grade horror films of old that Mystery Science Theater 3000 loves to spoof, and that is what makes this film so fun.  The first half is a road movie which establishes the characters so the viewer can get to know them.  Keitel and Clooney are great in they're roles, especially when they have to interact with each other.  The second half of the film is an over the top blood spewing gore fest (of the R rated kind) that will have you laughing your head off if your not one of those delicate types.  All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn is a blatantly cheesy horror movie that is just a reminder of the days when you could have fun while making a movie, and the audience can have even more fun watching it.  The great cast includes Cheech Marin (in three roles), Fred Williamson (blaxploitation extrordonaire), super sexy Salma Hayek, Kelly Preston, B-movie god John Saxon, and gore meister Tom Savini as a whip brandashing biker.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Okay, for all those who saw and enjoyed the episode, you've already bought this CD so this review is for those who haven't.<br />From the off let me say that not al the cast are singers but this works in the CD's favour, providing a  wonderful balance of &quot;reality&quot; to the songs.<br />Of the voices Amber Benson's voice stands out above all the others.  Tony Head and Emma Caulfield come in very close behind.<br />All the stars give their all and the lines crackle with emotional intesity and humour that the show is well known for.<br />Highlights include the soaring &quot;I'm Under Your Spell&quot;, &quot;Rest In Peace&quot; and the epic &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;.<br />Great episode, great songs, great CD.  Go buy it.
B00006M183|4.0|To start off, my brother and I combined own every Pearl Jam album from &quot;Ten&quot; to &quot;Live on Two Legs&quot;. We also have an ever expanding collection of the bootlegish live CDs. I just bought &quot;Riot Act&quot; without reading any prior reviews or anything, and I must say that it is outstanding. It is much different from earlier Pearl Jam CDs, but these guys manage to create a sound that is so original. Even though I would consider the album &quot;slower&quot; than earlier albums, it just rocks overall. The solos are very  satisfying, some of them are so amazing and heavy. In &quot;Bushleaguer&quot;, Vedder speaks a story, backed by awesome drumming and bass. &quot;I am Mine&quot; does not give the best impression of what the rest of the album is like. I stress that anyone who likes Pearl Jam at all should go out and pick this one up. You won't regret it. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because its not a classic...yet.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive was originally filmed as a pilot for a network TV series.  When the TV deal fell through, David Lynch went back and filmed some additional footage, then re-edited it into feature-film form.  Much of the cinematography is bright and cheery, which is a departure for Lynch.  I've pretty much figured out the plot after having watched the film three times, but my interpretation differs a little bit from other people's.  There is room for disagreement, as with most of Lynch's work, which is what makes it so fascinating.  When you watch this film the second or third time, certain major plot elements will jump out at you which weren't necessarily apparent the first time.  Although the critics seemed to like this movie, most of them didn't &quot;get it&quot;, presumably because they only viewed it once.
B000002NJM|3.0|the songs collected here are all great, but the production value of the cd isnt all that great.  it seems sloppy and rushed to me.
B00000J2PH|2.0|I've read the female empowerment stuff in here. Huh? \\"Where you lead, I will follow\\" There are quite a few others in a similar vein. Maybe it's just all these years of changing sounds and expectations, but boy do these lyrics and arrangements sound lame. \\"Ain't it good to know you've got a friend when people can be so cold.\\" That doesn't qualify as poetry in my lexicon.<br />Spare performances--they changed the way singer-songwriters performed, but this is like watching black and white TV. Interesting, but without the color it feels washed out, not vibrant and intense.<br />This is just one person's opinion--but I have surprisingly little interest in hearing these again.
6303014100|5.0|This film could have been a huge disaster.  Sets, locations, cast, script, bad acting, historical inaccuracies may have marred the production.  Fortunately for us, John Q. Filmgoer, this did not happen.  The locations were the actual battlefield, the cast included heavyweights like Martin Sheen, who did wonderful, and Jeff Daniels, who did wonderful as well (surprisingly).  The script was very good and helped keep the film moving most of the time.  The acting was very good.  The cinematography is lush and gorgeous-very well done.  The strengths of this film far outweigh the weaknesses.  As important a war film as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, FULL METAL JACKET, or PLATOON.<br />Highly recommended.
B00003CXXP|5.0|The movie is long, slow, and is always pushing you someplace, only you find out that when you get there it's not where you thought you would end up.  But I keep coming back to the sadness.  It's not the type of downer sadness that pushes those buttons that films find so alluring, but rather it deals with death in a way that gives meaning to death.  Not in the usual way of \\"rebirth\\" or even alluding to God and a new existence (another form of \\"rebirth\\", anyway) but rather absolute and final ENDING which has a beautiful closure and brings nobility to fatalism.  I wasn't crying for the loss of things, but rather for the acknowledgement of truth.  That being that even though life is a futile attempt at happiness, and is in a constant state of decay and entropy, when all is said and done maybe there is hope that even though things are not eternal, at least beauty and meaning can be experienced while life is still present.
B000000OA6|5.0|INNUENDO is one of those rare albums where even though I don't care for two tunes, the rest are SO strong that they totally overshadow and make up for the lackluster ones (All God's People, Delilah).  It is hard to lavish enough praise on this album.  Queen put out one mediocre album after another in the 1980's.  Sure, A KIND OF MAGIC and THE GAME had their high points, but INNUENDO is the bands strongest release since the 1970s.  Talk about going out with a bang!  Here Queen get back to their proto-metal roots.<br />The title track is an absolute monster, complete with gorgeous flamenco-style guitar interlude and walls of crushing Brian May guitar.  &quot;I'm Going Slightly Mad&quot; and &quot;Headlong&quot; are two great tunes that are very catchy.  &quot;Headlong&quot; is especially rocking.  &quot;Don't Try So Hard&quot; is beautiful.  It is the same type of tune that &quot;Who Wants To Live Forever&quot; is.  It slowly builds in intensity.  For a hard rocker check out &quot;Hitman&quot; and then the frosting on the cake; the awe-inspiring &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; -one of Queen's greatest songs.  Freddie soars on this one.  <br />Thank God they were able to record this great album before Freddie passed.  Despite his failing health, he sounds as strong as ever.  This album is as important as NEWS OF THE WORLD, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, and SHEER HEART ATTACK.<br />Essential.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is the finest FLEETWOOD MAC Hits collection ever and appropriately titled \\"THE VERY BEST OF(1975-97)\\" because it also includes many classic key album tracks that have become radio play staples over the past three decades since the BIG MAC became a superstar band. This \\"BEST OF\\" of cd is actually a testament and tribute to the BIG MAC's hit single glory days and to the fact that CHRISTINE McVIE will not be on board for the reunion cd-album of 2003. Sadly, the band's most consistent hit producing singer-songwriter has exited, retired and moved back to her beloved homeland of England after three decades of California superstardom living. You have to hand it to CHRISTINE McVIE and credit her \\"love songs\\" contributions to the band's gloriously rich catalogue. The BIG MAC will continue in 2003 with a new cd-album which will no doubt showcase the talents of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Though their only Hot 100 #1 was Nick's \\"DREAMS\\" single in 1977, CHRISTINE McVIE's richly melodic catchy dreamy lovesongs overshadowed the other two writer-vocalists' singles contributions on the hit singles/radio play lists charts consistently over the past three decades. Christine McVie's contributions yeilded HUGE hit singles for Fleetwood Mac and further catapulted the band into the memories of baby boomers and hordes of new fans from the next couple generations that came along. Christine McVie \\"came into her own\\" as a completely gifted and critically acclaimed recording/performing ARTIST from the mid-70s onward during her tenure with Fleetwood Mac. Thirteen of these 36 tracks have \\"Christine McVie\\" stamped as a writer-vocalist all over them - that's roughly more than one third(not counting several missing hit singles/album tracks) of this double cd set, though she's involved on every track! Christine's sultry smoky butter cream voice epitomized the sound of Fleetwood Mac though the other two vocalists stood neck to neck with her on talent and all three artists were so intriguingly alluring that there was no escaping the sounds of Fleetwood Mac as a whole unit. Even though Stevie Nicks was a \\"visual\\" lure to the Big Mac, Christine McVie was the ultimate vocal lure to the band's massive fan base.These artists collaborated with so much impassioned gusto that they were incredibly irresistable as a complete band! All five members of the BIG MAC had solo recording careers in the 80s, and each enjoyed substantial success for what they issued as solo artists, but their solo careers soon faded out and it became increasingly obvious that as FLEETWOOD MAC, they were were uncontested recording and \\"live\\" performing superstars! Back to \\"VERY BEST OF...\\">>> the missing links here are the classic FM/satellite radio staples \\"Warm Ways\\" - \\"Sugar Daddy\\" - \\"Oh Daddy\\" - \\"Heroes Are Hard To Find\\" - \\"Brown Eyes\\" - \\"Honey Hi\\" - \\"Save Me\\" - \\"Spare Me A Little Of Your Love\\"- \\"Never Forget\\"(all Christine McVie classics)...\\"Blue Letter\\" - \\"Crystal\\" (Lindsey Buckinham) - and \\"Angel\\" - \\"Beautiful Child\\"(Stevie Nicks)...but, there are plenty classic tracks here regardless! As for you fans that seem to always complain about the pre-1975 Big Mac era and lack of representation thereof: GET OVER IT(!) cos the worldwide masses outside England could care less, save for those classic Christine McVie tracks! It's like, WHY wasn't Fleetwood Mac such a superstar band before the collaboration of the FABULOUS FIVE?!!! Otherwise, if you're going to include a Buckingham solo track, you might as well include Christine's \\"GOT A HOLD ON ME\\" classic hit, cos it's about as FLEETWOOD MAC as you'll ever get! Good luck to the ultra-talented Lindsey on continuing the \\"love songs\\" of Fleetwood Mac in the future, and may he be fulfilled as the superstar artist he's always deserved recognition to be with the most perfect band behind him. Stevie, you've had your several respective turns, but it's LINDSEY's long overdue turn in the making for well over two decades. I was at the original RUMOURS tour in 1977, and also at the Reunion RUMOURS Tour 1997, and I must admit, CHRISTINE lured me to the concerts in 1977, 1980, & 1997,but, in '97 - Lindsey was the SUPERSTAR of Fleetwood Mac! Thank YOU, CHRISTINE McVIE, for all the spectacular performances and recordings I'll cherish eternally...your songs are a soundtrack to my love life!
0345404475|4.0|Philip K. Dick's novel \\"Do Androits Dream Of Electric Sheep?\\" is about a Californian bounty hunter whose job it is to track down and kill androids, that have escaped from another planet. <BR>Philip K. Dick makes in his very thrilling novel a point about the quality of humanity by depicting a society that defines human life by the ability to feel empathy. This definition makes sense within the novel, because the lack of empathy is the only criteria to tell apart human life from artificial life. <br />Rick Deckard, the protagonist of the novel, undergoes a rapid development, that finally changes his view of life. Other important aspects that are mentioned in the novel have similar existential quality, such as the importance of religion or the influence by mass media on our society. <BR>If you don't mind a very futuristic and somehow dark setting you will enjoy a compelling story that once you started, can't put down anymore.
038533558X|5.0|After reading Harlan Coben's Tell No One, I couldn't wait to get my hands on another of his works. The description of Gone For Good wasn't as intriguing to me, but having heard it was as good if not better, I had to try it. I am so glad that I did!<br />This book had me on the edge of my seat trying to make connections and links between people, and to figure out what was going on! But Coben only relinquishes as much as he wants the reader to know (which makes the book even better), and to the last page, I was shocked by developments. <br />Nothing in this book is as it seems, and if you think you know someone -- have you ever got a surprise coming to you! The protagonist -- Will, and his enlightened Yoga instructor buddy Squares are amazingly well developed. This book is full of fascinating twists, turns, and secrets. Coben writes with a comedic flair, and the ability to create three dimensional characters, some of whom you wish were your best friends. I am already seeking out more books from this talented writer.
B00004RYZT|5.0|Unbelivable, this guys are really meased up. The Concert is great, with excellent fireworks and show. If you are a Rammstein fan this is a must have. if you are not (like i was), it is too, and you will become one (like i did). AMAZING
B000007S5B|4.0|This CD is very diverse, but it's not as electrifying as their previous two albums. It starts off very poppy with \\"Hello I Love You\\" and \\"Love Street,\\" two good songs, the latter containing some great guitar lines by Robby Krieger. <BR><br />The masterpiece on this album was supposed to be the Doors' grand epic \\"Celebration of the Lizard,\\" but due to lack of focus in the studio (probably due to Morrison's hedonistic misbehavior)the group can only salvage the 4 minute \\"Not To Touch The Earth,\\" a dark, eerie song, and a high point on the album. Ray Manzarek's keyboard has some haunting effects that match the song perfectly. Other eerie highpoints on this album are the anti-Vietnam \\"The Unknown Soldier,\\" and \\"Five To One.\\"<BR><BR>Overall, this album is a very diverse, but a very uneven mix. This album has pop (\\"Wintertime Love,\\" \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\"), Krieger's brilliant flamenco guitar work in \\"Spanish Caravan,\\" and rather unexciting and jazzy ballads (\\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" and \\"Yes The River Knows\\"). It even has a terrible parody of an Indian chant \\"My Wild Love,\\" Containing some of the worst poetry Morrison ever wrote. <BR><BR>Overall, it's an adequate album if you want diversity. Some of the best songs by the Doors are on this album, but others aren't as great. Get this if you really want to dive into the Doors' career.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|In my view, that chief drawback of this dvd release lies in the lethargic conducting of Levine. There should be no doubt that the orchestra of the Met gives us playing of enviable standard here. Unfortunately, the music just drags on under the baton of Levine, who often fails to piece the many transitional passages together in a coherent and dramatic manner. His slow tempo also causes much straining on the part of the singers, and in particular Frau Behrens, whose slender and patchy voice cannot adequately cope with Brunnhilde's music. The other cast members are often little more than adequate. Surely not a great performance, which, as I've said, is unhelped by Levine's interpretation. Quite disappointing.
B000002KIE|5.0|Their attitudes WERE punk rock. It all reflects in the gritty (and rather sophistcated for a punk band) guitars, the aggressive drumming and the acertbic, sneering and nihilistic lyrics of Johnny Rotten. This was the pinnacle of punk rock and no one has topped their aggressiveness in the dying and withering genre of punk. Up there w/ the first 4 Ramones albums and the Clash's London Calling as the best punk album ever.
B000002GYI|5.0|When I bought the Computer World in Vinil years ago I listen time and time again and try to imagine the possibilities of having a computer in our homes. In that age no such thing were possible here in Portugal and inimaginable! Like the TV sets now we could have more than one. This Album is one of my favorite, and was produced in the great year of 1981!
B000002I2G|3.0|The Doors always took chances, but by 1969, the group wasn't really operating the way they did during the good old Whiskey-a-Go-Go days of 66-67. Jim Morrison's drinking and rowdy behavior had landed him with a police record (including an indecent exposure charge that he was later sentenced to 6 months of hard labor for; he died in 1971 while his appeal was pending), and musically the Doors weren't nearly as solid as they were on their first 2 records. Their 1968 release \\"Witing for the Sun\\" still had a few classic songs, but other parts of it were incoherent. Jim Morrison's baritone was suffering in terms of conviction and passion, probably due to his alcoholism, and his lyrics started to border on silly. \\"The Soft Parade\\" shows an already troubled group, willing to try new things from orchestral arrangements to elements of country-western, but ultimately, the album doesn't piece together the way it should have. The strings on \\"Tell All the People,\\" and \\"Touch Me\\" make the band sound like a Vegas lounge band instead of trailblazing psychedelic blues pioneers, and \\"Runnin Blue\\" is one of their worst songs, especially with guitarist Robby Krieger's poor Slim Pickins-styled vocals. Morrison's lyrics were, for the most part, terrible, and the band just sounds tired in most songs. Sure, they were able to create some great songs like \\"Shaman's Blues\\" and \\"Wild Child,\\" but others lack the intensity of their previous albums (especially their debut and Strange Days). Tensions in the band were piling on, and Robby Krieger took on more lyric writing duties, probably due to the fact that Morrison had become unreliable at this point. I read that Morrison wanted to quit the band by the end of 1968 because the pressure of fame was getting to it, but keyboardist Ray Manzarek talked him into staying in the band. Morrison exiting the Doors as soon as that might not have been such a bad idea. The next year proved to be a disastrous one, because this hodgepodge of an album was critically panned and many fans consider at as their worst (with the exception of the 2 they released after Morrison's death in 1971), and Morrison's infamous Miami performance threatened to derail the band's career. Maybe quitting the Doors in 1968 could've saved Jim Morrison's life. Yet again, maybe not. It could've also saved his reputation, for Miami wouldn't have never happened at least in the way that it did. The band itself could have gained from some time off, because their albums from this point could have been more focused, especially this one. Yet, the pressure of fame and the demand for the band was still high for the members to just walk away. So this is what you get. An album of a few great songs, a few songs that were decent, and some missteps. Even the title track, their attempt of an epic among the likes of \\"The End\\" was incoherent and dull. I'd only listen to this album for observational purposes only, and would only think of buying this album if you're a completist or a die-hard.
1563898586|5.0|The book is, as usual, much, much better than the movie. In fact, if you hated the film, you'll love the book!<br /><br />If you loved the film, you may not be ABLE to read the book, or much of anything else, either.<br /><br />The \\"League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" is loaded with references to other works that a sharp reader can pick up on. Sherlock Holmes references (not merely the obvious ones), James Bond, the Scarlet Pimpernell, art that is reminicent of 19th century popular illustrations, & un-numbered Jules Verne references.<br /><br />If you liked HG Welles, Arthur Conan Doyle, Poe, Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" or any other book from the 1870s-1920s, you'll love this.
0385484518|5.0|Mitch Albom takes his readers through a journey of love, friendship, life and death. This is a story that Morrie himself would have applauded. After seeing his favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz, on \\"Nightline,\\" Albom discovered his long lost professor and friend was terminally ill. <BR>Having lost contact with the professor for sixteen years, Morrie caught Albom's eye on television, discussing with the world a disease that would not only take his life, but provide an opportunity to change the lives of those he encountered.  <BR>This book is filled with lessons, not in a scholastic sense, but life lessons that must otherwise be learned the hard way. <BR>Through Mitch Albom, his final student, Morrie provides an in depth look at the lifestyle and attitudes of a man, dying happy. <BR>Albom shares with us the trying aspects of their friendship, the beauty in their relationship, and the wisdom gained from both perspectives. <BR>From reminiscing the college days, to experiencing death for the first time and experiencing life in a new light, Mitch Albom talks about his Tuesday visits with Morrie as if he had no life beyond this friendship. He explains his initial reluctance and discomfort, and later describes Morrie's overpowering honesty and confrontational approach to solving problems of any nature.<BR>Morrie addresses concerns and solutions to a variety of issues including religion, family, embarrassment, relational discomfort, death of a loved one, and the process of dying. <BR>From these lessons, for Albom and for the reader, humility and gratitude is achieved. This is not a book that must be re-read to remember the story, yet the story never grows old. Like popping in a favorite Disney movie at bed time or jamming out to a favorite song while doing chores, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is inspirational. Not only through each lesson taught to Mitch Albom, but through the disclosure of the carefree lifestyle and adventures of Morrie Swartz, Albom's interviews with Morrie motivate the reader, and seemingly force a self-analysis approach to understanding the meaning behind much of Morrie's statements and clichs. Albom describes Morrie as having always been a teacher of involvement. In one section of the book, Albom discusses Morrie's anti-war display when he gave every student in his class an \\"A\\" to help avoid the draft. <BR>Morrie's standpoint on life, though fully bloomed as death approached, had always been to help others.  Morrie's philosophy on happiness stemmed from a view of how much happiness one could bring to others. <BR>This book guides readers through its purpose, allowing them to see the sincerity and love in Morrie's humorous personality and perspective of life. This book will leave a lasting vision imprinted into your mind of what true happiness and contentment really is, and how to achieve it through humility and friendliness. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" provides a gripping look at the life of Morrie Swartz, a man who lived to teach. This book is a must read for people of all ages, gender and race. Upon reiterating the purpose of the publication of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" Albom put it best in the last four words of the story, \\"The teaching goes on.\\"
B00006M183|5.0|Okay, if you're looking for another &quot;Ten,&quot; then stop reading now.  Intrigued???  Riot Act continues to prove that Pearl Jam is an ever-evolving band not afraid to try something new as they perfect the old.  The first time I listened to the album, six songs immediately jumped out:  Can't Keep, Save You, Love Boat Captain, I Am Mine, Thumbing My Way &amp; You Are.  These songs all have their own Pearl Jam sound and can only be described as &quot;tight.&quot;  &quot;Can't Keep&quot; is an excellent intro to the album.  Rhythmic guitars playing over a steady and rolling drum beat all behind one of Eddie's smoothest singing performances.  Close your eyes and feel &quot;Can't Keep&quot;.  &quot;Save You&quot; starts and continues with great guitar and is the &quot;Eddie w/Attitude&quot; song of the album.  &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; is a little slower in tempo but again let's Eddie sing his heart out.  Great song.  &quot;I Am Mine&quot; sounds just as good on the album as it did on the radio. Reminds me of &quot;Nothing As it Seems&quot; from Binuaral in that I wasn't sure about it when I first heard it but now understand why it was the first single released.  My second favorite song on Riot Act, &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; is a long slow story that is beautiful from start to finish.  Very simple and tight.  Neil Young is proud of the boys for this one I'm sure.  Okay, my favorite song so far, &quot;You Are.&quot;  I guess this one was pretty much put together by Matt Cameron.  This is the most experimental song on the album and involves the synthesizing of guitars and drums by Matt.  Very &quot;funk.&quot;  And, of course, Eddie takes it to the next level by again singing with unmatched emotion.  The other nine songs on the album are classic Pearl Jam and although they haven't quite got me as excited as the six I already talked about, I'm sure that with a few thousand more listenings (which will happen) there are at least a couple more favorites to emerge.Overall, another great album from Pearl Jam.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney is incredibly talented in both her music, voice and looks.  I love every song on this CD!  Its so awesome!!  This is much better than Eminem's CD where they cuss, insult and use sexual lyrics in the songs.  I hope she will have many more Albums to come in the future as well.
B000066JES|4.0|To me Manowar has always been quite hit or miss, especially on their own albums.  For instance, on Kings of Metal, you had two of the more uplifting songs ever--\\"Heart of Steel\\" and \\"Hail and Kill\\"--side by side with \\"Pleasure Slave.\\"  Hail to England produced the majestic \\"Blood of My Enemies,\\" the heartfelt \\"Army of Immortals,\\" and the epic \\"Bridge of Death,\\" but seemed rather monotonous otherwise.<br />They keep up this trend with Warriors of the World, though I have to say they hit it a lot better on this one.  The traditional songs are not pretentious--they know it's all about killing the unbelievers, the posers (a term I've heard Manowar coined) and spreading the metal word.  They may not in themselves be unique by Manowar standards, but they are certainly enjoyable and get your heart pounding.  The production is flawless.<br />Much has been said about the departure from tradition, with the inclusion of \\"Nessun Dorma\\" (excellently done and works), \\"An American Trilogy\\" (I'm not a fan, but can appreciate it), \\"The March\\" (yeah, that was the big failure of the album), and \\"The Fight for Freedom\\"  About the latter--no, it was NOT a tribute to September 11.  Eric Adams has gone on record saying that song was written and recorded before the terrorist attacks.  The idea it is a tribute is simply coincidental.<br />Is the album perfect?  No.  Is it worthy of Manowar?  I certainly think so.  It isn't a big departure from their normal style--but why fix what isn't broken?  I certainly recommend it.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This Cd is totally different from everything else in the rock scene right now. The sound to me is very reminiscent of Cream and other psycadelic/acid rock band with components of grunge and metal.  When I first heard &quot;No One Knows&quot; on mtv2, i thought it was a good song, but after hearing it few more times it grew on me so much that I went out and purchased Songs for the Deaf. &quot;No One Knows&quot; is completely different from any of the other songs.  At first I thought this was a bad thing, but after a few listens I was hooked.  So if you buy this Cd give it a while, it will grow on you.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Well, this album is another fantastic work of art in the incredible saga of the band, Opeth. I think these guys can do no wrong in terms of songwriting ability and musicianship. \\"Deliverance\\" is a darker and heavier Opeth which harkens back to the days of \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\". The selection of 6 songs on this disc may seem rather small, however, at the 60 minute running time, and average of 10 minutes per song(the only exception to that average would be the 2 minute instrumental, \\"For Absent Friends\\"), the selection is very satisfying. <br />The songs on here are great. <BR>Wreath - A great, brutal album opener with a nice progressive flow.<BR>Deliverance - Classic Opeth at it's best. Great heavy parts, soft parts, musicianship etc.. One of the best songs Opeth has ever done.<BR>A Fair Judgement - Beautiful song. The softest song on here, beautifully sung and performed.<BR>For Absent Friends - Nice little acoustic interlude.<BR>Master's Apprentices - The brutality is back at it's finest. The heaviest song on here with Wreath. Great tempo changes throughout. <BR>By The Pain I See In Others - The Perfect album closer. The most progressive song on the album. This song even has little touches that I've never heard Opeth try before.<br />In closing, all I can say is that this is some of the best music I've ever heard, an it's making Opeth climb in my top three bands. This is an album which begs repeat listens. If you are a fan of Prog-metal, Death metal, any kind of metal, or music in general, \\"Deliverance\\" is a required purchase. I can't wait until \\"Damnation\\" comes out in March!
B00000DC10|5.0|This is, quite simply, the bast album I have ever heard.<BR>I had never in my life imagined music could be this way, and then in my 14th year i put this album in my stereo and my way of thinking about music changed.<BR>sure, i had heard hardcore music before, but never like this. <BR>the hardcore/punk aspect of this album is simple the background to this incredibly complicated, incredibly amazing work of art.<BR>In all years of growing and changing, my opinion of this album remains the same. <BR>If you dont think its genius, then well, im sorry.<BR>youre really missing out.<BR>buy this now, ... its just that good.
0375707972|1.0|I can't help but wonder if this book lost something in translation from German to English, and I can't believe Oprah Winfrey endorsed it. A friend lent me this book, and I am glad she did, otherwise, I would have been very upset if I paid money for it. First of all, the storyline is flat, and that was a big disappointment, because the premise of the book was great, I think Schlink could have done alot more with the idea. I also found the characters to be shallow and one-dimensional, especially Hanna. Michael, on the other hand, irritated me after only a few pages, he is completely narcissistic, self-centered and self-absorbed. As for the \\"secret\\" hinted at on the back cover?? The \\"big secret\\" was pathetic, I figured it out WAY before the author disclosed it. But the ending was the biggest let down, just when you think the novel might have a redeeming quality, that Hanna and Michael might be able to resolve some of their issues, you are slapped in the face.<BR>I would not recommend this book to anyone!
B00006SFBD|3.0|Opeth created one of the most astounding pieces of metal that has ever been blessed upon this earth. After creating Blackwater park, it is hard to imagine anything better as far as what Opeth has done. That album culminated all their previous efforts into one epic masterpiece.  Now Deliverace is not a BAD album persay. It is very enjoyable at places.  But I feel like this album has been rushed.  Whether Opeth rushed putting it out there or whether it was the record company pushing them so they could continue to ride on the wave of success that Blackwater acheived, the album is incomplete.  The heavy parts are still there and the soft parts are there.  But neither really grab you.  It doesn't sound \\"bad\\" it sounds bland, like you are listening to rehashed licks from previous albums.  The singing parts are not near as catchy as they were before. The singing vocals are almost drowned out to where they are not even vital.  The riffs are heavy but none just reach out and grab you as awsome, like Bleak or Blackwater did.  So this is subpar and this is not Opeth acheiving what they could have.  So get this if you are a die hard fan, because it warrants a few listens, but it nowhere near as great as Blackwater or My Arms, Your Hearse.   Opeth needs to take a little more time create some better material nextime around.
B000067G3C|5.0|Speed is one of those movies that has such a stupid premise its fun to watch, and many people do, myself included, over and over and over again until we are sick of it, and then we give it one more round. The film stars Keanu \\"Whoa!\\" Reeves as a LA police officer who boards a bus with a bomb armed below it. Go above 50 the bomb is armed, go below 50, Kaboom! Sandra Bullock stars alongside crazed bomber Dennis Hopper as a chick who got on the wrong bus this morning.<br />What really drives this movie along is the relentless action that director Jan DeBont seems to throw at the audience like it's candy. Coming off of one obstacle leads to another more challenging problem. Nearly all the time you would be board of \\"Not Again...\\" syndrome, but the movie keeps everything fresh and good and keeps you entertained for it's two-hour running time.<br />Speed was giving an initial release on DVD (along with it's god-awful sequel) back when the format was still young, while every studio has to double dip, FOX takes the cake with their excellent 5-Star Editions of classic action movies like Independence Day, Die Hard, and The Abyss. So here we are with Speed being given the ultimate treatment and you couldn't have a better result.<br />Video<br />For being a movie made in the mid 1990s the picture quality is right on and the color definition is excellent, especially during the explosions in the beginning with the first bus and the cargo plane at the end. Blacks, although not present that much, unlike Resident Evil, are deep when they can be seen on screen. I didn't notice any edge enhancement of the print, but then again I was to busy watching the movie. There are still a few artifacts here and there, but for the most part video quality is excellent and is right up there with Die Hard and ID4 for superior quality with the 5-Star name. <br />Sound<br />One word: Excellent. I love FOX for including the DTS soundtrack with it's ample use of your subwoofer. Your neighbors will be either pissed, or begging to join your party. I know I am a sucker for DTS, but man, this is an excellent track. While I still like the sound in Black Hawk Down and Behind Enemy Lines better, Speed's soundtrack is excellent. I do with that voices were a bit higher defined in the center channel, but with all the sound effects and explosions everywhere you won't be listen that hard to see where people are talking from. The THX optimization only adds to an already great sounding track. The disc also provides a Dolby Digital 5.1 track for those of you without the pleasure of DTS.<br />Extras<br />As with all of FOX's 5-Star DVD's the entire second disc of the two disc set is loaded with special features. You can see the full listing below, but there is some really cool stuff on this disc. You get some extended scenes, stunt break-down, an eight camera shot of the final bus vs. cargo plane sequence. You get music videos, and HBO special, screen play, trailer, and TV spots, not to mention interviews with the cast. A wealth of material and a worthy addition to the series.<br />Summation<br />Speed was a great movie when it was released on a bare-bones DVD, and it becomes an excellent movie with one of the best discs I have in my vast collection of DVDs. This is a great disc and if you are second guessing the position to buy it, don't, this is a great movie, pick this disc up now.<br />
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|I have never been so bored, nor totally hated a film as much as this. The three MAIN things that annoyed me were;<BR>1)the contrived and poorly acted whole love scene, relationship build up thing. If you could actually relate to the characters it would have been less offensive, but I've seen better acting in a Punch n' Judy on Blackpool promenade. A film about a relatively recent major event such as this deserves to be shown accurately (and NOT trivialised into some kindergaten love triangle).<br />2)The American centred, gung ho, flag waving, tripe that seems to pervade Hollywood these days. Hint for the inept director of this monstrosity- not showing the stars and stripes every two minutes could save something up to half an hour of screen time. Best quote to illustrate my point- the RAF bloke saying to Ben Affleck persona \\"if all Americans are like you God help anyone who wages war on you\\"(or something to that effect). Pleeeeease. <BR>3)This film is an example of the present 'political correct culture' in America, that is more offensive to all sides than showing events accurately. Cuba Gooding Jnr, who i think is a fine actor,puts in a rather annoying appearance as the token black guy, and the Japanese are sanitised beyond belief, in order not to offend the lucrative Japanese market. If anyone is in doubt of the double standards of hollywood, please watch The Patriot, and watch ACCEPTABLE levels of racism. <br />However, despite the above flaws, i have a new found respect for Affleck. Man that guy is great. He gets everywhere. Flying in the Battle of Britain, crashing in the Channel then miraculously surviving throught the night, popping back home to fight, then instantaneously make up with the Matt Damon clone, reunite with Girl, pretty much single handedly put up the defence of Pearl Harbor, shooting down numerous Japs. Then, as if America does not have enough well trained bomber pilots, he is drafted in to fly the Doolittle raid. Thats what you call a hero.<br/>In case you did not grasp the message contained in this review, I will reiterate. My good deed of the day is to strongly urge you not to buy/watch/go near this 'film', and save your hard earned cash for more enjoyable pursuits. You could buy a tin of paint, paint a wall and proceed to watch said paint dry, a veritable barrel of laughs compared to the agony of watching this film
B0000683DH|5.0|Everyone knows the curse of Star Trek movies that started with this sequel to the sci-fi pajama time known as Star Trek: The Motion Picture. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, this series of movies has been effected by the even-odd curse that makes all the even ones good and all of the odd one's blow. While a true fan, I don't believe any of them \\"blow\\" (sans Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, what the hell were they thinking), I do think that the odd numbered ones were not up to par with the rest of the series. After the long, drawn-out Star Trek: The Motion Picture the team returned to the series in 1982 and put together what is universally known as the best Star Trek movie ever. It has everything you could want from a movie, emotion, action, violence, and more. This makes up for the odd movies, and then some.<br />Star Trek II begins with the Enterprise leaving on a training mission full of new recruits, many who are experiencing their first time in space. What Admiral Kirk and the rest of the crew don't know is the USS Reliant has stumbled upon the marooned Botany Bay and remains of Khan's followers exiled from earth in 1996. The center of the plot is a device called Genesis that reorganizes dead matter and brings life where there is none. Khan wants it as the ultimate weapon, Kirk is trying to prevent the destruction of the Federation at the hands of a vengeful foe, and the rest of the crew is caught in the crossfire.<br />This movie is filled with some excellent space shots of the Enterprise in battle with the Reliant near the end of the movie. As you will see in some of the following screens there are some really neat camera angles, especially the one of the camera mounted on the nacelle of the Enterprise. While the special effects are very 80s and the new uniforms still aren't up to the one's seen in Star Trek: First Contact, this movie stands out as a Trekkie's favorite and any movie buffs favorite Sci-Fi film.<br />Video<br />Video quality is what you would expect from a twenty year old film. While for the most part everything looks good, you can see some shimmering in the print (especially during the opening Paramount logo). The colors seemed to have been preserved well on this digital transfer and they are much cleaner and brighter than the original Star Trek II DVD that was released in the film box set a few years ago. While no one generally likes to see a double-dip, if they improve the print this much, it is definitely worth the extra money.<br />Sound<br />Star Trek II is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, and while I still prefer DTS over Dolby it is understandable to not have it on a disc that was made before the audio format's introduction. Sound is generally good, and your subwoofer gets ample work from the low hum of the warp engines throughout the movie. Positional audio is right on and all channels seemed to be moderately well. At some part during the movie I felt that the speech was a big hollow, maybe suffering from audio compression to fit on the DVD, but besides those few moments (Kirk talking to Savvik on the Simulator Bridge and Kirk screaming in the Genesis cave are two examples) the audio is great.<br />Extras<br />Paramount went all out with this DVD and it features interviews with the original cast at the time of the original movie as well as updated interviews with the surviving members of the crew. It was nice to hear what DeForest Kelley thought of the movie and while I would have loved to hear what he had to say today, I know it can't happen. The movie itself features four additional minutes, including the oft-neglected scene where Scotty tells Kirk that a young crewman is his youngest nephew, so the emotional reaction when he is killed in the initial attack is understood more by the audience. There are featurettes on the special effects and the movie disc features commentary by the director Nicholas Meyer as well as members of the cast and crew. All in all the second disc is packed with about five hours worth of new content.<br />Summation<br />Star Trek II is one of my favorite Star Trek movies, it actually comes in a close second behind Star Trek: First Contact. While most fans can't wait to see Star Trek: Nemesis this December, picking up this DVD and seeing how it was done 20 years ago is a great way to pass the time. There are rumors of the Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Director's Cut to be released shortly before the 10th movie, but until then, enjoy this disc...P>-- Erich Becker is a die-hard Trekkie.

B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road has a simple, but effective ambiguous cover which brought the Abbey Road studio, where nearly all of their great music was recorded, to the attention of the public. It has been an important influence on the recording industry, and hasn't hurt British tourism either. I wonder how many people have been injured being photographed at that famous crossing?<br />If &quot;The Beatles&quot; [the White album] was the first Beatles solo album, Abbey Road sees them back together again, creating marvelous harmonies and playing as a real band.<br />This album features interesting, subtle, skilful use of electronic sound. Consider the long ending of I Want You (She's So Heavy), the synth solos in Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Because, for example.<br />George Harrison's songs on this album are his best ever, I think. Frank Sinatra said that &quot;Something&quot; was Lennon and McCartney's best song, and it does come close to the best that George wrote. &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; has terrific guitar sounds and interesting use of rhythm.<br />&quot;Because&quot; features the best example of the Beatles' use of vocal harmony, I think. The layering of 9 Beatle voices sounds superb, though the lyrics are rather dull.<br />The medley (originally on Side 2 of the LP) has snippets of songs that seem to flow logically into one another, until we arrive at the appropriately titled &quot;The End,&quot; which features the Beatles' only (and mercifully short) drum solo, and some exciting guitar exchanges.<br />I highly recommend this album, which I have enjoyed since I first heard it faintly over the airwaves in 1969. It is easily as good as Sgt Pepper and Rubber Soul.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is one of the most devastating (and depressing) films ever made.  It is the pinnacle anti-drug narrative.  And this film score is hands down one of the most engrossing I've ever listened to.  In fact, I would put it above anything John Williams has ever done (well, maybe not \\"Schindler's List\\", but everything else).  It's thematically brilliant, and contains some of the best editing for a music CD.  For those complaining about the repetitive and jarring nature of the score, may I suggest watching the film?  The repetitive and jarring editing is created specifically to add to the repetitive nature of drug abuse.  When most films simply use music for setting the mood, here is a score that emphasizes the themes at play in the film.  The Kronos Quartet, brilliant as they are, have outdone themselves.  This is simply one of the best performances I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.  It's been my number one CD for the past three days at work--strangely, it suits my boring, repetitive job and makes the time fly by.  Do yourself a favor and pick up Clint Mansell's stunning achievement in music, experimentation, and thematic beauty.
6305508550|5.0|This is a fantastic comedy.  It's sort of like watching Dilbert on the screen.  I absolutely loved it.  People who work in cubicles in particular will probably be able to relate to a lot of the comical situations.  It's a definite keeper for me.  I'm going to be including it in my dvd collection.
B00006M183|5.0|Maybe the 24 different varieties of Korn that are presently being passed as alternative rock will finally sound absurdly stale when contrasted to Pearl Jams latest.<br />I was happy to find parts of this album difficult to digest, as some of my favorite albums took weeks of listening before I was humming their tunes while out on a jog without a CD player. Those are the same albums that I can't stop listening to now, Pearl Jam's &quot;No Code&quot; is in that vein, 6 years old and it still sounds fresh. Songs from Riot act, like Can't Keep, Love Boat Captain, Thumbing my way, I am Mine, and all or none, I suspect will still be pleasurable listening in six, seven or ten years.<br />It seems that PJ is the only band these days that actually cares about creating their own music on their own terms, and no matter how many records they sell, that alone makes them a great band. <br />I think their latest effort enforces my opinion of them as a creative force in modern music. Thankfully they have evolved from Ten to Riot Act and have not made an effort to continue rehashing a single succesfull recipie. Instead each album has carried a different flavor.<br />The album as a whole touches on many themes, mortality being a prominent topic throughout many of the pieces. Green Disease and Bushleaguer continue a trilogy of Ed's songs along with soon forget from 2000's Binaural which protest the disparities between rich and poor, as well as The Government/Big Businesses  grip on our country. <br />The adition of keyboards to almost all of the songs is a succesfull attempt at adding a new level of richness to their songs.<br />This is a very good album, it is high in contrast from song to song and demands your interest throughout it's play. As with any PJ album this one should be listened to in it's entirety in order to be truly appreciated.
6303823351|2.0|Some people claimed that Beatles were not good actors, it is really true! but some die hard beatle fans have their own rights<BR>& said this is excellent! <BR>but I love to say that the pop music is a major of musical taste!<BR>Honestl y I´m not a huge Beatle fan. I am giving this film 2 stars because it is the beatles. Additionally, Beatles gave the strong<BR>cultural POP influence in the 60´s with their musical styles. That´s all & PLEASE END OF DISCUSSIONS!<br />In fact, I take a look the other better Hard Rock bands than this HELP,......check out the DVD´s like Led Zeppelin \\"THE SONGS<BR>REMAINS THE SAME 1976 or DEEP PURPLE London Symphony orchestra 1999 or Deep purple at the CALIFORNIA JAM 1974 are excellent DVD´s. These legendary bands are also not the good actors in their concert films but musically they<BR>are also the best one.
B000071K06|5.0|Well, this DVD is F...ing hilarious from start to end! Loads of action and all! Fun filled for the whole f...ing family. Austin powers in Goldmember is the best of the Trilogy (with Austin Powers 1 being the worst). I give this DVD 10 outta 10 stars!
B00006NSZ5|3.0|I got the 8 Mile soundtrack hoping that it would be another Eminem album.  Sadly, the CD is packed with lame cuts by minor leaguers.  Eminem's contributions to this album only serve to distance him further from every other rapper in the world.  He is the best on earth; his rythmic skills are among the best ever in our language.  He is in a class with William Shakespear and Dr. Seuss and not many others.  This is no exaggeration.  The songs here by 50 Cent, Nas, Jay-Z, etc. are just filler.  The album would have been 100 times better if it just included all of B. Rabbitt's battle raps from the film.  His version of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" in the film is better than all of the non-Eminem tracks here.  <br />So I give 3 stars.  But to brake it down, tracks 1, 3 and 16 get 5+ stars.  Track 2 gets 4 stars, and all of the other tracks get no more than 2.  Alas, maybe there will be a second volume of the soundtrack so that I can hear Em's dope rhymes that kills pretenders many more times.
0452281881|4.0|If you are in the mood for something quick, light, fun and funny, look no further than \\"e.\\"  I didn't really know what to expect from a book written entirely in inter-office e-mails, but it works!  Matt Beaumont has done a superb job with this novel.  I eagerly await the sequel.<br />\\"e\\" is the story of a group of employees at one of London's top advertising agencies, Miller Shanks, and the two weeks of preparation before the big Coca-Cola pitch.  Landing Coke is quite a deal, but left in the...ahem...capable hands of the creative department, it is as good as done.  Meanwhile, there are disasters on the horizon with other clients, and, of course, an office isn't an office without co-worker rivalry.  \\"e\\" provides readers with all the juicy details!<br />Despite knowing any background information or characteristics of the characters, Matt Beaumont has managed, through the e-mails, to give them all distinct voices.  It took several pages to finally put it all together, but their personalities eventually shined through.  I loved this novel and all it's two-faced bigwigs, [weak] employees, backstabbing, love triangles, and corportate politics.  Hilariously written and one I will definitely read again.  I also suggest Syrup by Maxx Barry, another great novel based in the corporate world, this time in behind-the-scenes Coca-Cola itself.
0553381709|1.0|Please do not buy this book, it rambles on for 900 painful pages.  The first 2 books were good even with all the players but this one hits the bottom of the barrel and then failed to give an ending.  Failure of ending a book is getting to be an epidemic with today's fantasy writers.  <br />As I read the book there were good parts but just about everybody I liked gets killed.  I told my wife every time I read the Storm of Swords book, the first 2 books were good, this one has to get better.  It never did.
0307120007|5.0|This is an awesome book and a classic!  My 18 month old twin girls have really been into touch and feel books.  This is definitely one of their favorites.  It has soft textures, scratchy texture, and the peek-a-boo is their favorite as well as the mirror.  It also has a scent page, which is great as well.  The only thing I would change is to make it more durable.  I've already taped it back together, and the comb binding comes undone easily when toddlers are handling it.  It is still a great book, and I would recommend it to anyone with toddlers.  At least it fits in my purse or diaper bag easily because it is small and lightweight.

B00006SFLV|5.0|During the early 1990's this show was a critically aclaimed success among my generation for a myriad of reasons. First off it chronicled the 'real-life' feel of high school while simmultaneously borrowing from the 'grunge' fashion craze of the early 1990's (albeit in a non-condescending manner).<br />Seccondly, it's characters were neither the 'cookie-cutter' nor 'junior soap' creations of other shows proclaiming to doccument the high school experience. Rather, the sheer magic of the show was the fact it spoke to us in our own language and our own terms.<br />My favirote character (due to her off-beat dressing) was Rayanne, but I also had a soft spot in my heart for Rickie Vasquez and of course Angela and Jordan. I was saddened the later two were never quite as close as I hoped they would become, but chalked it up to the show's intention of keeping things real.<br />That it was pulled by the networks should not be held against the show, but rather used as an indicator to show just how far ahead the show was in it's over all portrayal of teen life. If there had to be one show I would want my kids to watch many years later for 90's retro-tv, this would be one of my top shows. Long live MSCL!
B00006NSZ5|3.0|I got the 8 Mile soundtrack hoping that it would be another Eminem album.  Sadly, the CD is packed with lame cuts by minor leaguers.  Eminem's contributions to this album only serve to distance him further from every other rapper in the world.  He is the best on earth; his rythmic skills are among the best ever in our language.  He is in a class with William Shakespear and Dr. Seuss and not many others.  This is no exaggeration.  The songs here by 50 Cent, Nas, Jay-Z, etc. are just filler.  The album would have been 100 times better if it just included all of B. Rabbitt's battle raps from the film.  His version of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" in the film is better than all of the non-Eminem tracks here.  <br />So I give 3 stars.  But to brake it down, tracks 1, 3 and 16 get 5+ stars.  Track 2 gets 4 stars, and all of the other tracks get no more than 2.  Alas, maybe there will be a second volume of the soundtrack so that I can hear Em's dope rhymes that kills pretenders many more times.
0783225881|5.0|Don't pass this movie, it's not that much about baseball (thankfully) or heaven (thankfully again, the writer was agnoistic), those are merely just metaphores, this is a movie about dreams. I could watch this movie a millions times and not get sick of it. Amazing screen play, great cast, even Kevin Costner is tolerable... it's wonderful. This movie will reinstill the importance of dreams and paying no mind to those who can't see them. If you truly deep down believe in something and go for it that you will see your own Field of Dreams.
0446310786|5.0|This book is a wonderful portrayal of prejudice, not only of African Americans, but of all people as well. It gives examples of prejudices against the poor and strange; the story not only focuses on the main character (Scout), but also on the important events surrounding her and gives her child's perspective of the occurances. Her views on her father (Atticus Finch) and brother (Jem) are interesting, and through her eyes we are guided through a most interesting story. Though this tale deals with a lot of serious topics, it also has a subtle and unassuming humor that personally made me laugh. It is a well-written, well-balanced book that brings real topics to light and, at other times, brings a smile to your face.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This collection is a fine representation of Elton John's career.<BR>The only song I might have left off is the duet with Leann Rimes.<BR>But that is only a tiny flaw in a beautiful gem.  If you like Elton John at all, buy this.  The sound has been updated and is so wonderful and the booklet is just great!!  A very enjoyable romp through Sir Elton's music.
B00006M183|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a die-hard PJ fan.  Given that, any review I could give for a PJ album may be slightly biased.  Anyways, here I go.<br />Once again, Pearl Jam has released an album that sounds very little like anything they've previously released.  This is part of what makes Pearl Jam one of the most interesting and enjoyable bands in the world.  Every album from Pearl Jam is in a different direction.  This album is no exception.<br />After the slight disappointment that was Binaural, Riot Act is a major redemption for PJ.  At first listen, there aren't really any song that stand out as excellent, or radio friendly.  The album generally comes across as mello, but driven.  After a few listens, though, that drive causes the album to grow on you like a rash.  Musically, the members of Pearl Jam are really at the top of their game, too.  They play rock music in a way that other bands just aren't right now.  They aren't pressured to mold themselves to match what's popular on rock radio.  \\"I Am Mine\\" is a testement to that.  Only PJ would pick one of the mellowest songs off their album to release as thier first single.  Each song is quite a bit different from the one before, but as a whole the album is very connected.<br />All I can say is to give this album a few listens.  It may not grab you the first time around, but it's so addictive it's bound to get you eventually.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album caps off U2's great back-to-back triumvirates starting with &quot;Unforgettable Fire,&quot; &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; and then this mold-breaking transitional master work.  &quot;Unforgettable Fire,&quot; is perhaps their most moody and artistic, &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; their most earnest and spiritually fiery, but &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; is both commercially accessible and experimental.  Whereas the Edge owned &quot;Unforgettable Fire,&quot; and we'll give &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; to Bono, this album has Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton's stamp all over it.  In most songs in fact the bass line is jacked all the way up to &quot;11&quot; and pushes the music pile-driver style.  I challenge you to find a rhythm more catchy than that created by Mullen Jr. in &quot;Mysterious Ways.&quot;<br />If there is any critique of this CD, I guess it would be that each and every song is a veritable hit making them not stand out as unique works in and of themselves.  The songs are so good it plays like a greatest hits album in fact.  Unfortunately, this album marked U2's ungainly leap into further experimentation with the sub-standard &quot;Zooropa&quot; and &quot;Pop&quot; where Bono lost his sincerity for lyrics and the band seemingly lost their collective minds, but only for a little while as they returned somewhat to form with &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind (Bono's lyricism is still spotty in places).&quot;  One of the best album's of the 90's born of Berlin's Zoo Station and other urban scapes across the globe.  This is U2's finest.
0812548094|5.0|When I was eleven, I first got my hands on Terry Goodkind books from my brother. The first one being Wizard's First Rule was awesome! I loved it! Within months I started collecting the collections. I was reading the books pretty fast, but then I decided to take a break. While I was taking a break I couldn't help from reading the book, it is so addictive! Having read the whole collection of the Sword of truth(except the 6th one have to borrow that from my brother!)I believe this one is the best! It is very suspensful and fun to read! I am now in eighth grade and still love reading the Stone of Tears!

0671027344|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. I have read it 5 times and I love it more every time. I would recommend it to anyone who likes teen books and has good taste. (he he he) I really think this is the best book that I have read in my whole life. It changed me for the better.
B00006M183|4.0|The cd starts out with &quot;Cant Keep.&quot;  This song reminds me of &quot;Sometimes&quot; off of No Code.  It is a great way to start the album and a great song.  &quot;Save You&quot; picks up the pace a little bit.  &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; is one of my favorite songs on the cd.  It is about the nine spectators that died on the 2000 tour.  Cropduster, Ghost, Get Right, Green Disease, and Help Help are all similar songs.  They are my least favorite of the cd and are the least like the Pearl Jam that I love.  &quot;I Am Mine&quot; and &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; come back to back.  These are some of my other favorites with their poetic lyrics and their smooth feeling.  Bushleager reminds me of &quot;I'm open&quot; from No Code where eddie is saying poetry.  The best part of this cd by far is the last two songs.  ARC comes on and I am floored.  Eddie is singing to the top of his lungs in a chant voice with other voices in the background blending in.  This stops and leads into &quot;All or None.&quot;  A typical slow song for the end of the cd.  I loved it.  Over the years Pearl Jams music has evolved but they have never produced a cd that wasn't original and flawless.  This cd adds to it a piano and a dige.  The solos are amazing and the lyrics keep you thinking.  Buy it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|OK reviewers. Get with it! Some of you are too young to remember the &quot;originals&quot;. I was a disc jockey for over 30 years, and I know my music. To say they're &quot;remakes&quot;, and the quality (echos and fades) sound bad (like in Heartbreak Hotel) is wrong! These are the original recordings, and RCA isn't ripping anyone off or trying to promote poor quality. This is the way Elvis' recordings sounded in the 50's. Remember, &quot;stereo&quot; wasn't around then, and the &quot;echo&quot; effect was. This album is truly great. The only song I miss is &quot;My wish came true&quot;, the &quot;flip side&quot; of the hit &quot;A big hunk of love&quot;. from 1959. Elvis &quot;lives&quot; on this album. Enjoy.
B00006IRJU|4.0|Great music from the 80`s.<br />If you have more than 30 years, this is your music !!
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is by far the best metallica album yet. For you metal or metallica fans I highly recommend purchasing this album. The price is right, the music is great, and it'll last forever. I listened to this album and was completely shocked. I didn't think that they would ever be able to top \\"Kill `em All\\" but I was completely wrong. This album is not only heavier than kill em all, it is more musical. If you like the early metallica then you will love this album. If you like the new sold out metallica album then you will not like this album, unless you like both. It is a huge inspiration to all metal fans.
B000002JB3|5.0|Well, I must say that I completely disagrees with the reviewer below! This is to me one of Phil's best albums, and though a few of the songs ought to have been left off, that is no problem - I do have a programable CD-player, and the rest is just nice stuff!<br />Best track is the title track - fantastic rhythm and horn arrangement, and wonderful happy lyrics. I can't sit still while hearing this one, it's such a happy tune. Lorenzo is fantastic as well - great lyrics and wonderful african inspired music. The Bob Dylan remake The Times They Are A-Changin' is terrific! I would never haver believed this to be a succes, but here it is, complete featuring Phil on bag-pipe and all! Wow. The Same Moon is the only more silent song of the album, featuring a fantastic guitar sounding quite different from anything I've herd elsewhere - deffinitely another favorite!<br />Add to this wonderful african inspired sound on River So Wide, Phil's first venture into blues (Oughtaa Know By Now, Just Another Story) a couple of plain but lovely pop-rockers (It's In Your Eyes, No Matter Who) and a couple of funny uptempo songs (Wear My Hat and Take Me Down) - well, what more can one ask for?<br />I only really dislike That's What You Said, which is plain and boring, and Love Police, which has some awful lyrics (but a wonderful melody) - but as I said, a CD-player may be programmed. That several of the songs were done much better live (especially Wear My Hat) makes this album slightly less enjoyable, but oh well.
B00005OAIE|4.0|There's not a lot to dislike about John Mayer's &quot;Room For Squares.&quot; The disc is consistently pleasurable throughout -- and there's nothing wrong with that!<br />&quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; comes as close to blissful pop perfection as any song I've heard in a long, long time.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I was tempted to give only one star to this film, but the<BR>purely visual beauty of the film is impressive and the<BR>\\"lesbian\\" scenes are both tasteful and erotic. However,<BR>that is sllim fare for this disappointing film. Lynch breaks<BR>no new ground, anyone having scene Blue Velvet or<BR>Twin Peaks will spot the lynchisms. The narrative is<BR>non existent and who really cares how many hidden<BR>clues (if any) are to be found upon subsequent viewings.<BR>(this is no  Usual Suspects).<BR>The film collapes upon itself, perhaps by design, but<BR>leading to my own attention span collapse. And why<BR>is Robert  Forster given star billing when we see him<BR>so little? Oh well....in short, this is a perhaps typical<BR>\\"aren't I cute\\" Lynch effort. and yes even the most<BR>literate film viewer might be wasting his/her time here.
B000063JDE|5.0|It's really just another week in the South, folks.  <br />We all carry on like this down here.  I can send you all the Franks and Bens and Dorothys you would ever want to meet direct from North Carolina (where Lynch filmed this classic).  This fact used to really amuse me in LA where I saw this back in 1986, and everyone then and there thought Lynch had invented some sci-fi world.  Oh, Lynch had definitely taken sharp, genius note of smalltown America in the South: that is what makes an artist good.  <br />But 'Blue Velvet' is REAL, folks, just in case you've been stuck in Visalia or San Diego all of your life with all of those colorless people pretending so hard to look and feel like a Gap ad.<br />None of this should be taken to mean that BLUE VELVET is anything less than a wonderful black comedy packed with brilliant moments of poetry, cinematic fireworks, and slippery kitsch. There are few moments in comedy/surrealism to equal Dean Stockwell lipsynching to Orbison's &quot;In Dreams&quot;, or Dennis Hopper repeating the same lyrics to Kyle McLachlan before he smears the kid with lipstick and sneers &quot;Pretty! Pretty! Pretty!&quot;<br />Lynch's tale is also a rather acute evisceration of a psychosexual journey in the mind of a young man, Jeffrey Beaumont (Beaumont means of course, &quot;beautiful mountain&quot;, or &quot;beautiful view&quot; even).  He meets Dorothy Valens (self-explanatory), and is visited by his blond siren, gal pal Sandy (the Goddess Cassandra, of course.)  BLUE VELVET is ripe with readings and references.<br />Lynch's is a wonderful achievement in having a good, wild time at the movies.  Wasn't this one of the few films of the 80s or 90s that even managed to pull one completely into its dream? For me it was.  Most junk today is just passive eyecandy, face it.<br />'Ben, you are so suaaaaave.'  <br />'Frank, stop it!! Yes! I like to sing Blue Velvet! Mommy Loves You!'<br />BUY IT NOW!
B00006CXXU|4.0|When I first heard Christina was coming out with a new album, I was really curious about what it would be like. Not being a huge Christina fan, I was surprised to find that the CD contained some pretty cool music. Among my favorites are her duet with Lil' Kim and \\"Beautiful\\". Both incredibly different but both very powerful in their own way. With the exception of the CD cover which I find a little offensive, I say this is a must-have addition to any collection.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Yeah, i see Abbey Road is at 4.5 stars too. sigh..<br />This album may take a while to grow on you and it is a somewhat dark record, but beneath the grating exterior the harmonies, chords and emotions are sheer brilliance.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I've bought VHS of Marilyn Manson: God is in the TV two years ago and it was great. 1 hour of Music clips, plus additional 1 hour live from tour. It was the coolest VHS I've ever seen.... Until now. 2 days ago, I find out in the shop long awaited DVD GGG. I came home and insert it into my DVD Rom. I only check out, if DD 5.1 is active and immediately press play button. The show, which was waiting for me, was indescribable. I have seen Marilyn Manson in Prague,Czech Republic, but this DVD offers much,much more. It includes records from Japan to Europe and (of course) scenes, I've never could see (anywhere). I love this band!! They're like no other I'm listening to or even I know. Every MM fan MUST have it and see it on his own eyes!!!!
B00006M183|4.0|...This has been a long time coming, and it rocks pretty hard.  Pearl Jam has been off the radar for a while now, and \\"Riot Act\\" is a killer return...<br />The new material is pretty impressive...The album has melodies in it that are more complex than previous Pearl Jam efforts.  There is something very profound in this.  <br />This record has a great feel.  Pearl Jam could easily make status quo, but instead, they try to make something they haven't made before...There is something about this band that gives them a timeless quality.  Perhaps it is the fact that there is no urgency to produce.  They have been in the light, they have been in the dark.  They know their fan base.  In \\"Riot Act,\\" they create a new piece of brilliant work that should be on every alt-rock fan's CD shelf.
B000067DNC|5.0|It's my opinion that Stargate SG-1's second season was its best. It was a huge step up over the first year, and would set up many plotlines that continue well into the show's current sixth season. Among my personal favorites this season:<br />The Serpent's Lair: A slam-bang, take no prisoners action-packed follow-up to Season 1's cliffhanger finale.<br />Prisoners: SG-1 are imprisoned unjustly and must escape with the help of a kindly old woman who is not what she seems.<br />Thor's Chariot: SG-1 returns to Cimmeria, and must try to contact the fabled Asgard to stop a Goa'uld invasion.<br />Secrets: A reporter threatens to expose the Stargate project to the world, Sam tries to reconcile with her estranged father, and Daniel reunites with his Goa'uld enslaved wife Sha're.<br />The Tok'ra: An epic and moving two-parter that introduces the Goa'uld rebels called the Tok'ra.<br />Touchstone: Someone on Earth is stealing valuable relics from other worlds, and SG-1 is blamed.<br />A Matter Of Time: Earth is in danger of being sucked into a black hole - through the Stargate!<br />The Fifth Race: After an alien encyclopedia is downloaded into his brain, Col. O'Neill undergoes a strange transformation that leads to contact with new allies.<br />Serpent's Song: SG-1's archenemy, Apophis, seeks sanctuary on Earth, but one of his foes will stop at nothing to retrieve him.<br />Show And Tell: A mysterious, invisible alien race threatens the destruction of all human life in the galaxy.<br />1969: A lighthearted romp through the Summer of Love ensues after SG-1 is thrown back in time.<br />This set should be at the top of any SG-1 fan's wishlist. With first-rate writing, acting, and special effects, Stargate SG-1's  second season is TV science fiction at its finest!
B00005UEAR|4.0|Unfortunately my first exposure to Dream Theatre was through their 1997 album Falling Into Infinity. I couldn't get into it and frankly I wasn't impressed much by it. Sure they could play fast, but the songs were pretty much like any other metal band. I got the impression that they were good musicians but not good song writers. Then one day I went to the CD store and I saw this album on the shelves. I was really bored and needed something to listen to and there wasn't anything else that even vaguely interested me. I decided to give Dream Theatre another chance and I bought this two CD set hoping I wasn't throwing my money out the window. I'm happy to report that haven't regretted it. I am now officially a Dream Theatre fan.<BR>It took me two or three listens but I started getting into the music but eventually it happened. I like the extended track on CD 2 which deals with the theme of mental illness and depression but I prefer CD 1, especially the last two movements of The Glass Prison. Misunderstood is a great heavy ballad that I find myself listening to a lot and and the other three tracks and interesting too.<BR>Since then I have bought Scenes from a Memory, which I also like, but not as much as Six Degrees. I also dusted off my old copy of Falling Into Infinity and have begun getting into that one too, although it is clearly inferior to the other two above-mentioned albums.
6304169558|3.0|I saw Twister in the theatre and then got the video when it came out. Director Jan DeBont had some awesome special effects in the movie. However, even great directing can't overcome a plot that is predictable and unfocused.<br />Basically, the plot centers around a group of professional \\"storm-chasers\\", scientists who track tornadoes and go where they strike. Meteorologist Bill Harding(Bill Paxton) has created TOTO(Totable Tornado Observatory), a device that sends sensors into the heart of a tornado to see how the storm behaves. Bill's former colleague--and now rival--Jonas Miller(Cary Elwes) has come up with a similar invention, and Bill accuses Jonas of stealing his technology. In fact, when Jonas demonstrates his machine, he and Bill nearly come to blows. There is also a romantic triangle here. Bill's estranged wife, Jo Thornton(Helen Hunt), like him a weather scientist, has divorce papers ready for him to sign, and Bill's girlfriend, Melissa(Jami Gertz), has come along to get a piece of the action. Bill at first wants to retire from storm-chasing and settle down with Melissa, but he is dragged back into the tornado scene when he discovers that Jonas wants to take credit for inventing something that he(Bill) in fact came up with.  Finally, as we see in the opening flashback scenes, Jo's father was killed by a tornado when Jo was a little girl, which is part of the reason for Jo's intense interest in the tracking of storms.<br />There is intense action throughout as Bill, Jo, and their fellow storm-chasers race across the Oklahoma countryside which is part of the Midwest's Tornado Alley. When I saw the movie in the theatre and later watched it on video, I was awed by the special effects--for instance, houses coming apart, cows spinning around, a pickup truck being lifted off the ground, fuel trucks blowing up, and the sky literally turning black in seconds. Also, TOTO, which Bill nicknames \\"Dorothy\\" in the film(from Dorothy and Toto, who were transported to Oz by a tornado in \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\"), transmits some memorable color images, despite the mishaps Bill and Jo endure in getting their machine into the air. In the end, Melissa, who is terrified of storms and who realizes that Bill and Jo might still have feelings for each other, decides to leave. In the last destructive storm, Jonas, Bill's chief antagonist, dies when he gets reckless. He fails to secure his machine properly and as a result is sucked into the funnel cloud. Bill saves Jo's life by holding onto her as she clutches a pole, and they get back together.<br />Despite its awesome storm scenes, though, Twister is no better than average. Although I like its special effects, I think the plot lacks focus. If the movie had concentrated more on the action, I wouldn't be too disappointed. However, in my opinion, writers Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin, in trying to develop the personal lives of their main characters, twist the plot(pardon the pun) in so many directions that it is sometimes difficult to figure out, and the characters aren't really interesting. There are also some scenes that I believe are completely unnecessary to the movie--for instance, the one where Bill, Jo, and their colleagues take a break from storm-chasing to go to the home of Jo's aunt for a steak-and-eggs breakfast. However, I think Twister's special effects save it from total disaster--after all, it's a movie about a natural disaster. The special effects alone make Twister worth seeing.a tornado in \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\"), transmits some memorable color images, despite the mishaps Bill and Jo endure in getting their machine into the air.

0440237688|5.0|I thought this was a very good book!! I liked it very much.
B000002AZ8|4.0|You can tell Eddie wrote most of this himself and its a good album and all but, the songs on this album dont sound as good on here as they do live.<BR> &quot;nothingman&quot; is a great song,one of their best in my opinion, but the version on &quot;live on two legs&quot; is much better.<BR>This is a more experimental album for them too, which takes some getting used to.<BR> It's definitely worth owning, but you may find other live recordings of these songs to be much better.
1571200851|4.0|This book is a lot of fun.  It's pictures are beautiful and the diagrams and illustation informative.  You'll want to try every fold in the book.  Some of the quilts made with these folds I would be afraid to wash but they are beautiful and a joy to try.
6303471730|3.0|I agree with everyone else who said it was poor quality.  The movie originally was great.  Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne are wonderful together.  Unfortunately the tape was very snowy and was very hard to enjoy.  It really looked like someone taped it off a really bad tv.  I am going to buy the estate version and hopefully it will be better.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Where do I begin? This series from beginning to end just floored me. Was it because I've always been extremely interested in history (particularly WWII)? Was it because my grandfather (god rest his soul) was real life friends with one of the actual \\"main\\" men of Easy Company portrayed in this film? Was it the great acting, high production values and attention to detail? <br />Yes.<br />This is one of those war films that draw you completely into it - you feel yourself get involved with Easy Company. When an episode is over, I felt myself thinking about what that must of been like in real life as the credits roll. I'll tell you right now, speaking as someone who has seen many war films including \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Guns of Navarone\\", \\"Bridge over the River Quai\\" (my spelling could be off) and many many more -- the accuracy of this film is easily verified with a little research to your nearest library. <br />Btw, this is probably the first time in about 4 years and 30 or 40 \\"movie\\" reviews that I actually gave a 5 star rating. (So you know I'm not \\"easy\\" on films).<br />Take care.
B00006M183|4.0|Ok so here's the album that al of us pearl jam fans have been waiting for and....well? I have to say I like the album but it may not be what most people are expecting.<BR>What I mean by this is that this album has a mellower feel than any of their other albums(the only thing that comes close is yield).<BR>     Riot Act is not as dark as their last album(which I personally like much better than this one),it is lighter and more radio friendly than the previous album.<BR>     If you havent liked anything since \\"ten\\", then this is not the album to buy, but if you have liked \\"yield\\" and everything since, then you will probably like \\"Riot Act\\".<BR>     In my opinion it is definitely worth owning, even though it isnt the best Pearl Jam album.
B00006EXCC|5.0|The Stones finally stopped filling half their albums with respectable R & B covers and turned in a brilliant mid-sixties masterpiece with \\"Aftermath\\". Okay, maybe not a MASTERPIECE in the sense of a \\"Let It Bleed\\" or \\"Exile\\", but pretty durn good nonetheless and their best album to date. The first side of this album is as strong as \\"Revolver\\" and I might even be inclined to argue that it's better. I'd buy this before Between the Buttons for sure. The album ends on a flatulent note with the lame \\"What To Do\\" (which should have been a b-side) but everything else is top notch. The remastered sound quality is remarkable and really smacks you in the face on first listen.
B00006M183|5.0|I heard I am Mine on the radio and realized that Riot Act would be a success, and i wasnt disapointed.  Recently the band has drifted away from more mainstream rock for more space-like vague songs.  Binural was a disapointment for me.  Riot Act's songs return Pearl Jam back to Vitalogy and Yield, which for me were two of the bands best albums.  The album is sincere, political, and very diverse, something that many Pearl Jam fans have been needing.  Songs like Cant Keep, Save You, Love Boat Captian, I am Mine, 1/2 full are very traditional PJ, while Get Right, Green Disease remind me of the Ramones.  Bushleauger and Thumbing my Way add alot of diversity to the album Bushleauger takes a few shots at George W, and T.M.W is a very slow intimate track.  My favorite song on the album is number 8, You Are, the guitar on the song reminds me of Rage Against the Machine, this song alone would have made me buy the album.  Overall any Pearl Jam fan that has Yield and Vitalogy and loves guitar based power rock needs to buy this album, you WILL NOT be disapointed.

B000002A46|5.0|In 1996, fresh out of college, I decided to use my skating skills to make some moolah. I worked at Rock Center in NYC thru the whole season. One night, our beloved manager David, put this in the cd changer. I'd never really listened to this before, but I fell in love. It's EXTREMELY skate-able, and blends traditional gospel with childrens' carols and just a touch of going to church on Christmas Day. I play this in July, too, just to remind me why I love Christmas so much. A fun album, one of the better holiday choices. Snoopy, Mariah, and Nutcracker--that's my musical trinity when I put up the tree and need inspiration as I untangle the tinsel. Lots of fun, and I would have never paid attention if I didn't work under the greatest tree of all! Thanks, David!
0446310786|5.0|An interesting story of three children and their exploits in the backdrop of 1930's Alabama. It keeps you riveted though it does not have the suspense, violence and corporate mumbo-jumbo of nowadays fast novels portraying big city life. This book is very soothing read, will keep you smiling to yourself and will talk to the evergreen child in yourself, you'll be happy you read it.
1586210912|4.0|For a three disc set you only need discs 2 &amp; 3 to learn anything. Disc 1 is an autobiographical account about Mr. Kiyosaki and a childhood friend &quot;creating their own money.&quot; I found this quite boring.  I think it's more of a lead to introduce you to Rich Dad and Poor Dad.  Discs 2 &amp; 3 were fantastic and I learned quite a bit.  No need to buy into his infomercial items as I think he hits 90% of that stuff right here in this audio book.  If you need inspiration to be an entrepreneur, this is the tool for you!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I heard a review of this album on NPR &amp; then had to go out &amp; buy it. It is a great album to listen to &amp; I have since brought it for 3 friends who have enjoyed it as much as I have. It is well worth the investment.
0812513495|5.0|When Ender Wiggin was taken to battle school, he had no knowledge of what he had said yes to.<BR>   Time is running out for the battle schoolteachers as well as the planet earth. The buggers (who are a species of alien) have attacked earth twice already. The IF (International Fleet) must destroy them, and their home planet once and for all. The teachers try to keep secrets from the battle school geniuses, but one thing that can't be kept secret is that the third battle is about to begin. <BR>   In a last effort the IF begins training geniuses at an early age. They do it so they have a suitable fleet when they start the third battle at the Bugger's home planet. There is almost no hope of winning the final battle in which one race must come to an end, but can the human race stay alive? Or will the buggers defeat them once and for all?<br />Ages 11-adult. I have seen kids and adults reading this book so its great for anyone.
B000004286|5.0|The music is stirring and inspiring.  As a lover of all things Scottish and particularly of this film, I cannot recommend this soundtrack highly enough. <br />Add this to your collection and you won't regret it. Don't forget the additional music on 'More Music from Braveheart'
B000000OUW|3.0|Manowar can make a record completely loyal to their fans anytime, everytime.  Through tragedy and discomfort they have emerged as one of the most loyal metal bands, and this record pays tribute to their tenacity. With songs like courage and return of the worlord, Manowar shows us they can still blow our brains out and have us coming back for more.  For anyone that wants to return to a time when courage was everthing, purchace this record.
B000062XM7|5.0|As a Daniel Day Lewis fan, this is a must see! As a movie fan in general, same response!  Great acting by all in the cast (unusual in itself), beautiful cinematography, wonderful score (recommend that as well).  One of the best on screen kisses, too.<br />Don't try to compare it to the book. Watch it for its own merits and avoid the DVD at all costs. They have edited out all the wonderful, memorable lines that make this a great movie.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I have heard it said that brilliance is close to insanity. I do not know whether or not this is true, but A BEAUTIFUL MIND, helped me to see what a brilliant person goes through when they also suffer from schizophrenia and what they see and do. <br />This performance by Russell Crowe, as Dr. John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who, although unknown to the viewer at the time, shows signs of schizophrenia upon entering Princeton University, is Oscar calibre material as far as I am concerned. This is a true story about Dr. John Nash, who develops an economic formula which earns him a coveted position at Wheeler Labs. His brilliance at solving codes causes him to be approached by the Pentagon. <br />Not knowing that he was schizophrenic, I truly believed that he was involved in government espionage work and was becoming so frightened that he was showing signs of madness. Not knowing anything about the life of Dr. Nash, I had no idea what the theme of this movie was and found myself shocked to realize that Dr. Nash was \\"seeing and hearing things\\". I still do not know how much involvement was real and how much was imagined. <br />Jennifer Connolly gave an excellent performance as the wife who stuck by him through the good times and the bad, helping him to live with his illness and filter back into a functioning life,teaching at Princeton, and eventually earning the Nobel Prize in his later life. <br />Christopher Plummer gave an outstanding performance as the psychiatrist who tries to help him. Again, at first, there was doubt as to whether he was a \\"good guy\\" or a \\"bad guy\\". <br />The movie, directed by Ron Howard was riveting. It had humor and sadness and held my interest throughout. It was not until the end of the movie that we learned this was a true story. <br />I highly recommend this movie. It was rated \\"PG\\" and there is not any reason that teens cannot see it, or mature young people. There was no explicit sex and no extreme violence.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love this album!  I expected a lot out of this second LP since the first one was great, and yes, XTina did deliver tenfold.  Naked or not, everyone knows this woman is talented.  Yes, she dresses a little off center and her hair could use a comb, but at least she's not britney (like that's anything new).  I rank Ms. Aguilera up there with Ms. Carey and Ms. Houston, but off course she's got a long way to go.  But if Stripped is any indication of a good career ahead of her, she'll surpass both the (fallen) ladies.  Sorry to say it, but with success comes rock bottom.  I hope XTina doesn't fall into that trap.
B00006IUNN|1.0|I enjoyed John Woo's previous movies for what they were, simplistic action movies with exiciting action, relatively clever plots and decent dialogue.  This movie is awful however.  The acting is bad.  The script is bad.  The characters are bad.  And Woo goes overboard with the battle scenes.  It's almost like he watched Saving Pvt Ryan and decided that he wanted to recreate the intense and graphic battle scenes himself - which he does about 10 times during the movie.  Eventually you get sick of watching soldiers hurtling thru the air with missing limbs.  I struggled to watch the whole film.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Seriously, are we supposed to put this movie the same class as the first one? This was a very Disney-like attempt to make money from a sequel.<BR>Aside from a few clever one liners, a hilarious cameo by Michael Jackson, and the fact that Laura Flynn is very pleasing to the eye in Victoria Secret apparrel, this movie was really 'disapointing'<BR>\\"But what about the scene stealing dog?\\" you say, ok the dog was funny in some points, mainly riding in the car. Ultimately I would say that if you laughed at the trailer, thats as much fun as you're gonna have.<BR>A more appropriate title for this would've been \\"Burger King, Nokia, and Mercedes Benz present MIB 2!!\\" because its really a big commercial. It didn't exactly help that there were some very obvious 'product' shots thrown in which really get annoying after a while.<BR>On the postive side, the team up of Jones and Smith is still funny, but ultimately you get the feeling of 'I've seen all this before.' To those who haven't seen it, I would say 'see it, if its a rental that someone else is paying for because they ran out of copies of something you would want to see, like oh I don't know: Episode II.
B00006LIRI|5.0|Well, I've read a few reviews on this album, and all have been either ok or negative.  However I personally believe that these are some of U2's best songs ever.  They're a bit more electronic than the ones on the previous Best Of album, but that's the normal course of evolution for this band.  Plus, it includes hits from the 2 best U2 albums ever, Achtung Baby and All That You Can't Leave Behind.  The new songs are VERY good, especially \\"Electrical Storm\\".  William Orbit is a genius and it's great that he added his ethereal sound to this track.  Other great additions are \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" featuring Luciano Pavarotti and \\"Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me\\" from the Batman Forever soundtrack.  While it's a great album, I think it'll suffer from the I-like-their-earlier-stuff-better syndrome, which is a popular opinion for second greatest hits albums.  Look at Madonna's GHV2, another fabulous album that has been ignored for this same reason.  I own both U2 Best Of albums plus quite a few of their studio albums.  Maybe it's because in 1990 I was 13, but I actually like this newer stuff better...
B00003CXAY|3.0|After reading the previous review from the gentlemen who owns an IRE special edition of Koyaanisqatsi I suspected they must have done the same \\"image cropping\\" to Powaqqatsi.<br />Well, after comparing the Powaqqatsi DVD with an old VHS edition published back in the late 80's I can confirm that in order to go from 4:3 (VHS) to the 16:9 format of the DVD they simply cut the top and bottom part of the image. The DVD does NOT show extra stuff that would come from a wider picture.<BR> <BR>Very stupid I think. The movie was probably shot in 4:3 originally.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This is definitely not as quirky as some of Beck's other albums. It's no Odelay, that's for sure. It's got a different vibe. The whole album is very somber and acoustic and depressed. The emotions are a lot different from some of his older stuff. Even though what he delivered here was unexpected, it's still a moving album that is worth every penny.
B00006IU73|5.0|I have been listening to Porcupine Tree for years and own all of their albums. I think (and have thought) that they are simply one of the best modern bands around. In terms of the quality of their playing, compositional strength, ambience, production, and (most importantly) consistency, there just is not another band that comes close. In all these years, I have said over and over that they have the potiential to break and be the next big thing.<br />It looks like it could be happening - I told you so!<br />Well, maybe not Nirvana-style where they destroy all the [garbage] on the charts (too bad). I have just had more and more people come up to me and say \\"do you still listen to Porcupine Tree? I saw their video the other day\\", or \\"I saw their album on sale\\", or I read \\"Porcupine Tree on tour with \\"so and so\\" this Fall.\\" A couple of years ago I had hoped that this break would happen with the absolutely flawless \\"Stupid Dream\\", but in all honesty it couldn't have happened to a nicer album than \\"In Absentia\\".<br />Early word on \\"In Absentia\\" was that it was the heaviest recording that the Tree had ever done. That made me nervous, but not because I don't like heavy music. Porcupine Tree always evolves and innovates from record to record in the most interesting ways, which makes them a progressive rock band in the truest sense of the word. However, many progressive bands play heavier when they start running out of new compositional ideas. It's sort of a cheap way to innovate.<br />However, after many listens, I'm not sure if \\"In Absentia\\" is really all that much heavier. Remember \\"Dislocated Day\\" from \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\"? That song, as far as heaviness and energy goes, is comprable to the work done here. Porcupine Tree has been doing that for years. In terms of production, however, the mix is MUCH heavier. Guitars are more massive and drums are turned up and EQ'd in a very metallic way.<br />After all is said and done, this heavier side is only a new tool in the tool box. The sonic palatte that \\"In Absentia\\" is painted with has some sharply constrasting hues. There is always the ghost of Pink Floyd that haunts every Porcupine Tree album. Steve Wilson's breathy David Gilmour-esque vocals largely contribute to this, as well as cleverly claustrophobic lyrics and attention to ambience. We also have some thicker Beatles/Beach Boys style vocal arragements.<br />It is difficult to point out the strongest points on the album without citing pretty much every song as my favorite for one reason or another. If you are wanting to get an overview, listen to \\"Your Blackest Eyes\\". This roars with some of the heaviest guitar riffs of the album, but quickly and convincingly modulates into a strumming pop style verse and singable chorus. Honorable mention goes to \\"Wedding Nails\\" for being one of the best thought-out rock instrumentals since YYZ and to \\"Heart Attack in a Lay By\\" for creating an evocative, emotional, and lucid atmosphere.<br />While mentioning things in an honorable fashion, I should take a second to point out that everyone in this band has nearly virtuosic chops. Steve Wilson is a fascinating talent. He can write and produce comparably to many artists that have much more experience. As if this wasn't enough, he really can play the heck out of the guitar. I was also admittedly nervous about the loss of Chris Maitland. He was so perfect for the band - Nick Mason feel with Neil Peart chops! I told myself quickly, though, that Steve Wilson would not fail to find a guy that would at least fill his shoes, and Gavin Harrision easily does this. Perhaps he plays little less subdued than Maitland, but nonetheless has chops galore and can really make the drum set speak.<br />The lowdown: Yet another nearly flawless album from Porcupine Tree. If you want to watch a band walk a tightrope (made of Rush's heaviest licks) between Pink Floyd and Radiohead, stop what you are doing and buy \\"In Absentia\\".ol box.

B00006RAKP|3.0|Another greatest hits compilation from Elton John, After Greatest Hits, Volume II, Volume III, The Very Best of (Import),1976-1986, Love Songs and One Night Only (The Greatest Hits)-the horrible live album, here comes Greatest Hits 1970-2002. Granted Sir Elton has had a long career filled with ups and downs with a lot of wonderful songs, so let's hear a few other hits.  I'm am a huge Elton John fan, having every commerical release and was excited about this purchase as well. The songs on the disc sound wonderful but there are so many hits lacking which is why I gave it only 3 stars. How about a 3rd disc with many other top 20 songs that he had. Where is Blue Eyes, Healing Hands, Empty Garden, Part Time Love and nobody in the US is going to believe that Written in the Stars with LeAnn Rimes was a bigger hit than Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds which doesn't appear here. I think rabid Elton John fans would have loved more material, especially from the down side of his 70's career and 80's comeback. So the songs weren't up to snuff but wouldn't it great to hear even some guilty pleasures for old times sake like Ego, Bite Your Lip, Victim Of Love (well maybe not),Nobody Wins, Chloe, Kiss The Bride, Who Wears These Shoes, Wrap Her Up, A Word In Spanish, Club At The End of The Street, The Last Song and the extremely wonderful and Adult Contempory #1 Simple Life. Look I mentioned 17 songs in this review, easily another full disc of music. Guess we fans will have to burn our own greatest hits from Elton John to get what we really want especially from later in his career.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I can't say that I am a big Nirvana fan. I always thought they were a bit overrated both when they were big in the early '90s and to this very day. I was a big fan of grunge (and punk music) back in the early '90s but not with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. Still I did think they put out some really good songs, plus they killed that stagnant hair metal scene that was huge in the late '80s and early '90s. So for that, I will be grateful to Nirvana for killing the dying beast otherwise known as hair metal, and ushering in a new era for popular music. As a casual fan, I had to acquire this compilation. It definitely wasn't for the never-been-heard song \\"You Know You're Right\\". I am not impressed with that song to be honest. I wanted to hear how well songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\". Surprisingly enough, those two songs (as overplayed they were), still holds up well especially with the sea of ...that is being passed off for rock music, let alone alternative music. Most of my favorite Nirvana songs have come from \\"In Utero\\" and pretty much are the reasons I bought this cd although I also wanted to hear \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" as well. I love the infectious opening basslines to \\"Come As You Are\\". And then there is the sing-along chorus to \\"Rape Me\\". One of the catchiest Nirvana songs I have ever heard. As a woman, I suppose I should be offended by that song title but I'm not. Kurt Cobain's angst resonates through out that entire song as well as with the rest of this album. The more I listen to this album and to each song more carefully, I realize how much the world needed Kurt Cobain and still do. There is a magic in the songs that I really don't hear in most new artists and bands today. For this casual listener, I think this was an excellent compilation. For diehard Nirvana fans, they probably would be better off with the upcoming boxed set.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The friend who loaned me her well worn cassette of this album (so worn, in fact, that the song listing printed on the plastic had long since been rubbed away by her fingertips) told me she laughed when she first listened to the track titled \\"Fitter Happier\\". I might've laughed, too, if I hadn't found it so chilling...and after countless listens still I find it no less affecting....
6301966562|5.0|This is one of the most underrated 80's movies. Back then, if you relied on media hyperbole to determine what movies were or were not worth seeing, then you missed out on a lot of good films and got dissapointed by a lot the ones you did see. The concept of a love triangle between a boy, girl, and computer sounds like it could be campy. But this movie is genius in that it actually makes you forget that it all started when Miles (Lenny Von Dohlen) spills champagne on his keyboard.<BR>Miles is played as middle of the road between the average joe (who's got to read the computer manual), and the awkward geek. He's an architect trying to design a new brick in his spare time, so you know he's smart. This was long before Urkel canonized the geek caricature. Virginia Madsen plays Madeline the love interest in this one. And you could tell this is an 80's movie in that Madeline displays immediate interest in Miles because of his intelligence and shyness(which used to be interpreted as sincerety not lack of confidence, at least where women were concerned). Unusual today where down and dirty bad boys like Vin Diesel and The Rock seem to attract all the women.<BR>Parts of this movie seem like the way I remember music videos. Slow, romantic pieces are rare for music vids these days and the dream sequence is surrealistic harking back to a similar animated sequence in 1980's Xanadu. It actually helped give the story atmosphere instead of just being eye candy. <BR>This definitely rates as a fairy tale or a fable. Some of the scenes in this movie are almost prophetic in that 18 years later, were looking back an asking \\"How did they know?\\" Most notable is the hilarious concert scene which fortells the age of those annoying musical cellphones. I was a geek back in the 80s but didn't care about fitting in so this movie is nostalgia in that back then, geeks ruled their own little turf. You avoided computers if you didn't know what you were doing. Did I mention the music was excellent. Brought back those 80s memories.<BR>The only thing I saw wrong with this movie was that it did seem to depict 80s home computers as a little more powerful than what I remember them to be. But then, this is a story that can happen anywhere and within reason, anytime.<BR>So puleeaze, if they can get your run of the mill recent movies out on DVD seven months after theyve been in theatres, get this one out...its been seventeen years.
0800135954|5.0|If you don't like to cry at movies, don't see this one.  If you don't normally cry in movies, and think that you can stay tough through anything, think again.  I NEVER cry in movies, and I was nearly brought to tears about 6 times during this.  Not that it was a bad movie.  Not in the least.<br />This movie really makes you care about the characters.  Three brothers, a father, and the woman that drove them apart.  To me, the father was the most endearing, because even when faced with the most horrific challenges, he manages to overcome them.  Tristan, the main character, and his brother Alfred, both run away from their problems, only to different places, and the youngest, Samuel, didn't live long enough to have any.  The catalyst is the woman, Suzanna, who first becomes engaged to Samuel, and then finds out that love isn't everything she'd wished for.  (I'd tell you more, but I don't want to ruin the story.)  At the edges of this brilliant picture, are the people who truly run the farm, including the old indian master, the indian/white convict couple and their half-breed daughter, who at thirteen knows that she will marry the middle son, Tristan (significantly older than her).<br />To me, the whole movie moves forward with a self-desctrustive determinism, that no matter what happens, life continues, sometimes with even more devastating effects.  The real tragedy of the movie is not what happens to Tristan, but what happens to those around him.<br />As for visual effect, the general impression of the movie doesn't change.  The boys and the father remain dressed in very similar clothes throughout the movie, having lived on a ranch almost their entire life.  We see the decades change from the 1910's to the 20's to the early 30's through Suzanna's clothes, the one female in the movie with the luxury of changing fashions.<br />The strength of this movie is in it's story, and the director has done a superb job in simply enhancing the tragedy with simple shots and simple styles, instead of loading up the visual side of it without letting the characters stand alone.<br />To me, the whole movie's attitude is summed up by two phrases, spoken by Colonel Ludlow towards the end of the movie to his middle son, Tristan.<BR>&quot;You're not damned, Tristan.  I won't allow that.&quot;
B0000024K1|5.0|In my opinion PE's masterpiece \\"It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back\\" is the single most important record in hiphop history, and one which will be remebered 50 years from now as generations \\"raise their fist to the music\\". PE really outdid themselves on this one.<br />There are those who would say that the \\"beats\\" on this record are little more than noise, and I would agree fully. The tracks are very noisy, and have a sense of experimentation which has yet to be surpassed. The Bomb Squad created tracks that were quite interesting to listen to, and it was a true experience to follow the tracks along as they weren't the typical verse/chorus/verse brand either. Thrown in the social commentary of Chuck D, the comical rants of Flavor Flav and the cuts of Terminator X, and you have an album worthy of the Hall of Fame.<br />If I could ask anyone who picks this album up, don't listen to the music at first, but rather give it one spin paying attention only to the lyrics. I gaurantee they will chill you to the bone.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one of those albums, perhaps 5 to 10 of them, that I can sit down and listen,to, and they just take me with them to another place, and my world just goes away for an hour.  Luckily, I can take the experience back with me to my world and write this review.  Radiohead went so far beyond anything else out in music at the time with this album, it's hard to describe it.  I think this album has some highpoints and lowpoints (I mean emotional lowpoints, not musical lowpoints, there are none of those) which have been discussed ad nauseam by the other reviewers here.  Fact is, each person has their own favorite songs on this album, mine are completely different from other people's, but the point is, this album has taken ahold of us, and we all recognize it for the genius it is.  The &quot;rain down . . .&quot; section of Paranoid Android, Exit Music (For a Film), Fitter Happier (I don't understand why people call this filler, that computer voice is so intense, I find myself shaking afterwards), and Climbing Up the Walls.  Also, I just want to help get this rating back up to 5 stars.
B000003B6J|5.0|Listening to this album is a lot like witnessing a robbery that just wnet wrong, and someone was killed. Unlike PE, who's landmark &quot;It Takes A Nation Of Millions...&quot; which was released about the same time, N.W.A. didn't provide commentary on the social struggle. They simply offered insight in to what would happen if things were not fixed, and just how out of control they can truly get.<br />&quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was the record that scared White Amerika, and was the record they didn't want anyone to hear. Why? Well that's a simple question, White Amerika didn't want the world to know what was going on in it's backyard, and were afraid to allow anyone to hear it. Reality at it's most bitter, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was a classic record from start to finish...
0385335482|5.0|I love Becky!!  She is an absolute scream.  I could relate to so much of this book.  Becky, while seemingly always in over her head, still manages to maintain a good outlook and a positive view.  The character keeps a running commentary in her head justifying her purchases, and kept me laughing out loud.  Also, highly recommend the sequel, Shopaholic takes Manhattan
B00006NSZ5|4.0|This is the best soundtrack I ever heard. My favorite song is Wanksta by 50 cent. Any fan of Eminem or 50 cent should cop this album because they push this album to above average status. It also has Nas dissing Jay Z and a coo song by Xzibit. This ones a must buy forreeal.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is simply an amazing album. The RHCP has been around for a long time, and the only CD I could find that I enjoyed was Californication, with some of the slower more thought out songs. But now this takes the cake. An incredible CD.<br />By The Way:The great title track. It blends traditional Chilie Peppers and their newer, more slow and thougtful style.<br />Universaly Speaking: A great song, fast paced chorus, guitar solo at the end, everything. One of  the best on the CD.<br />This is the place: Not my favorite song on the CD, but not bad.<br />Dosed: A beautiful song.<br />Don't forget me: One of the best songs on the whole album, with amazing background vocals.<br />Zephyer song: Some great guitar work here, and along with the great vocals, the CD wouldn't be the same without it.<br />Can't Stop: Punky, rappy, fast paced-this song is more a look back at what RHCP was before. Not the greatest.<br />I could die for you: A beautiful love song. Not my favorite, but it's pretty good.<br />Midnight:Again, Not my favorite, but definitly a good song.<br />Throw away your television: This is good, but far from the best. Fleas Bass holds this one together.<br />Cabron: This one's amazing, yet totaly different from any other song on this album (Or any other album I own, for that matter).Listen to it for yourself.<br />Tear: Wow. Another one of the top five on the CD (Of have I said that about six now? Oh well).<br />On Mercury: Another interesting song. And another you'll need to hear for yourself.<br />Minor Thing: Not my favorite on the CD, But good.<br />Warm Tape: Strange song, but another great one.<br />Venice Queen: To be honest, I owned the CD for about a month before I realized the pntential of this song. It's easy to skip it because the begining isn't the the most exciting music in the world. But a few minutes into the song, the mood changes completely. Another hit...P>BUY THIS CD!

B00006SFLV|5.0|I had heard the buzz from this show for almost a year leading up to its premiere. I came in with low expectations.<br />I don't think it's hyperbole to say that this show captured the experience of being a teenager better than any other show had before or has since. It was both timeless and timely and that is a hard balance to strike. If you take out the music and watch the show, it could be happening now. Angela Chase and friends deal with the same issues that today's teens do. Guns in school, alcohol and drugs, first love, insecurity about their changing bodies. It's all there.<br />The characters are rich and engaging. They are true to themselves. The writing is superb and incisive. The show is well cast and the acting is excellent. The music is incredibly timely and sets the mood of the show equally well. ... <br />I've read this a number of places and I ultimately think it's true. The show was ultimately doomed because of Angela herself. The person she confided in most was herself and the times that she came to her greatest revelations were within self-reflection. There were no solutions, only emotional patches to help get from one personal crisis to the next. We like to see our characters resolve things with the help of their friends and everyone goes home happy at the end of the day.<br />I can't do anything but recommend this show. I have been for 8 years.
0375704027|5.0|It is amazing how a novel which is so fundamentally sad could somehow also be so redemptive. Sitting in an airplane and hearing an orchestra cover of a Beatles song,  Toru Watanabe remembers clearly the first girl he ever loved.<br /><br />_Norwegian Wood_ is a book about suicide-- about a young man who has to choose between one girl longing to be with the dead and another girl who is trying to come back to life.<br /><br />There is plenty of humor in the book, Midori is one of the most charming characters to be found in the modern novel. For all its sadness in its characters, the book is never really sad.<br /><br />Going on my list to be given out as a gift for Christmas.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Many Wagner snobs may decry the traditional staging - but what use is modern new wave stagings unless you have seen the orginal first.  is it helpful for a first time Ring viewer to see Valkyries on bicycles for example.  As most people will not have seen the ring on stage this traditional version must be welcome.<br />I loved Levines thoughtful reflective reading on the music score.  The singer is as good as it can be - all the big Wagner stars were in this production.  It may not compare with the great cast ensembled for Solti landmark audio recording but what can?  <br />For those of us who cannot understand German the subtitle is a godsend).  My understanding of Wagner has made a quantum leap!  The importance of subtitles cannot be underestimated for this work because the total integration of words and music.  In fact even if you can follow German I think that you would understand it better with the subtitles (in German).<br />The sound is superb esp in DTS - better then the CDs of either Barenboim or Solti.  One other great thing about DVD and Wagner is that only two DVD are needed for each opera.  So you can listen to your favorite bits without the hassle of changing DVD<br />After the release of this DVD I do not think I will ever listen to my CDs again.  I probably want even bother seeing the Ring again on stage!<br />Highly recommened
0140186409|5.0|Whatever you political principles and ideas about economics, you would have to be inhuman to fail to grasp the utter injustices committed against poor peasants during the Great Depression, reflected in the desperation and dehumanization brought about on the Joad family, who lost all they had and were forced to wander the American West in search of pure survival.<br />Tom Joad gets out of jail (where he had landed after he killed another guy in a fight)just to find his family destituted and forced to leave their land. So begins what has to be the saddest road-novel of all times. The Joads jump up into a waste of a car and start traveling to California, looking for the chance to get jobs in the prosperous citrics-growing trade. In the road they will suffer all kinds of setbacks and humiliations, until the terribly beautiful, meaningful and symbolic end. Several characters will leave you indelible impressions: Tom Joad himself, a simple but brave man; JC (get your conclusions about his symbolism), the appearing and disappearing ex-preacher; and, above all at least for me, the mother of the Joads, a lovable, courageuos, indestructible human being, one that makes you want to weep for her while feeling a towering admiration for her dignity.<br />Inserted between chapters are short reflections and background about those times, as well as small asides full of symbolism and literary beauties. Some say that Steinbeck's explanations have been proved distorted: don't let that interfere with what is a work of fiction. Such things have happened throughout human history, and what this book does is remind us all that we have a debt to our fellow men (and women, of course).<br />An epic of the eternal fight against indignity and misery, it deserves its fame and prestige.
0385334206|4.0|i thought that this book was one of the best books i had ever read.  i loved how the book used so many different subjects such as: Flamingos, gangs, aliens, Chicken, and insanity to keep you on your toes when you where reading.  this book was ment to entertain and i think that it did a very nice job of doing that.
B000065U1N|2.0|Well the movie follows the book, unfortunately the book is written Hollywood style.<br />Many of us who were there saw read the book and laughed. The movie made us mad, and the fanfare wade us sick. Anybody who claims that this is the real deal, was either not there or was not involved with the battle. <br />The story told is so flawed with innacurrate accounting that the make the QRF seem like the Keystone cops. It makes the Rangers seem like the poor overwhelmed troops, and the Somalis are not given full credit for the coordination of the attacks. Yes it did show the heroic efforts of the Rangers and Delta that were fighting in these horrific conditions, that is the only saving grace of this movie.  <br />The true story of what actually transpired still hasn't been told, and it never will be, because the true story is not a movie, nor a book anyone wants to read or watch. There were agregious errors made in the planning and execution of the mission. There were also a lot of missed opportunities that happened prior to this battle. <br />But it is so so entertainment if you try not to take it seriously.

B00005YW4H|5.0|The first time I  heard \\"Come Away With Me\\" played on our local radio station I was completely taken by the vocals and the music. I just had to have it. It is just one of those songs and cd's that completely drains away any feelings of stress you may have and makes you feel calm and revived. The entire cd is very enjoyable. *
B00006IR5S|4.0|Williams, with his first score, for Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone, came very close to copying, plagerising, if you will, many themes of previous soundtracks. He has redeamed himself wonderfully with the soundtrac to the Chamber of Secrets. Although it does not have the \\"gusto\\" and musical speed and action the first score did, the score for the Chamber of Secrets is another great and high original piece for Williams. This is a great score for any Harry Potter fan to enjoy, I know I do. Have a wonderful day.
0451191153|4.0|I am a junior in high school.  When I first read The Fountainhead, it was like a revelation for me.  I thought that my life was basically meaningless as it was, and to truly experience enlightenment I must learn to be &quot;selfish&quot;.  However, that initial passion has since faded, and I can now step back and see some of the fallacies of the book.  Although great in concept, Objectivism, as the extreme opposite of Communism, may work in much the same way.  I also noticed that characters in Rand's books (I have read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, and We the Living), especially the female characters, are fundamentally very similar, both in appearance and character.  This does not detract from the books' overall appeal, but does take away a little of the mystery and intrigue.  I love these books though, and while not agreeing totally with every aspect of Rand's philosophy, I appreciate the beautiful workmanship of her writing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is amazing. I cannot say enough about it. She is completely amazing. Her voice is so soothing and so awesome. I cannot wait for her to release even more recordings. This is a definite must buy!
0385484518|5.0|Two books have changed my life. Tuesdays with Morrie challenged me to live every day fully and not take any relationship for granted. Everyone should read this. A reader told me if I liked this book to read an excerpt of a novel by Kirk Martin at thegraveldrive.com. I did and I was hooked! The Gravel Drive changed the way I look at my kids and I will never be the same. &quot;Time only moves forward and each second that is passed will never be regained.&quot; Every parent needs to read Martin's book. Both are full of simple wisdom that will change your life.
B000002KHH|5.0|While better musicians, lyrics and production techniques have revolutionized rock in the 3 decades since &quot;Paranoid&quot;, the simple fact is that rock music keeps returning to it's roots over and over again. This LP, with it's rudimentary riffs, slow sludgy pacing and cryptic lyrics has been copied a million times and with good reason, nothing else in rock/metal sounded it like in the early 70's and it inspired thousands of teens to pick up guitars, start bands and talk openly about their feelings of alienation. &quot;Iron Man&quot; is the first song I learned on guitar and Geezer Butler's melodic bass sound on the title track made me want to learn bass. &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; is downright ambient with Butler's bass right up front, and it's languid arrangement is actually quite relaxing. The playing, singing and lyrics here are far from virtuostic, but they still sound awfully cool to me. Every genre' has to start somewhere, and &quot;Paranoid&quot; is a great starting place for metal and all it's admirers. A Classic.
B00006SFBD|5.0|This is the kind of music we need more in America. Talented, original, innovative music that doesn't stick to a formula. This album has brutal singing and some of the most creative guitar work ever. Opeth has gottn even better on this new album. The restless Opeth ghosts haunt on. Best album I've heard all year!
B00005JK8K|3.0|I usually love John Woo movies. This one was just OK, despite extremely realistic battle scenes. Main reason is that the promise of a movie about the Windtalkers was unfulfilled.This was a second-rate &quot;reluctant buddies&quot; movie, where one of the buddies just happened to be a Navajo. This movie reminded me ot the recent two Star Wars disasters -- all effects and very little character development. It's still watchable, mostly due to Woo's brilliant battle scenes, although it's certainly not for the squeamish.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have very diverse musical tastes, all across the board. Normally I buy pop albums just to hear some fun, brainless music and don't really expect anything but catchy hooks and dance beats. So I bought the new Christina album. Wow! I didn't expect the depth that she goes to in the lyrics in most of these songs. She bares her soul on many of these tracks, letting the whole world experience the pain she has been through in her life. I can't remember another pop tart who has done this other than Madonna and Janet. And I didn't expect it to be Christina to do it. Anyway, even if you don't like pop music, you should give this album a listen. The lyrics are great, the arrangements are awesome. I can't pick a favorite because the tracks are so diverse that each one has something fresh to offer. But the track \\"I'm OK\\" is absolutely mindblowing. Christina's voice is stripped down and very emotional. I think Christina might be on her way to the Grammy podium with this album, if the judges have any sense.
B00006IR5S|5.0|The new Harry Potter soundtrack returns us to the world that was created by J.K. Rowling and given musical life by John Williams. While revisiting old themes that are already beloved, there are new themes that are introduced for the first time. The wonder Fawkes the Phoenix seems to be the dominant theme and will be cherished as much as Hedwig's Theme from the first movie. Then there's the dark Chamber of Secrets, filled with mystery and suspense. The other track are exciting, like The Flying Car and The Spiders. Harry's Wondrous World from the first movie concludes this installment of what is sure to be one of the best movie series ever, if not for anything else but Williams' wonderful score.
0140067477|5.0|I have read the tao te ching, and this book perfectly mirrors the largest message in lao tzu's work. Things work out on their own, and it's mostly our meddling that cause them to go wrong. To do this one has to be simple, and not worry about things constantly. I know that the whole idea of simplicity being a virtue might set some intellectuals on edge, I can understand this. Our society is not overly accepting of thinkers, therefor it makes us rather defensive. But this book does not condone stupidity in any sense of the word. In fact, the character of pooh is very interesting in the fact that while he does not know many things, he draws very logical conclusions using the information he has available to him. I consider stupidity to be the act of willfully ignoring the world around us, and it seems so do Lao Tzu and Benjamim Hoff.<BR>    Throughout &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; Hoff uses the pooh stories as examples of how Taosim works, while his narrative more clearly explains the characters and what type of people they represent. I think the best example of this is the Pit story. When Pooh, Rabbit, and Piglet are lost in the woods Pooh notices that they keep on coming back to the same pit whe they try to find home. Thus he concludes that if they try to find the pit, the will end up back at their houses. A perfectly logical conlusion based on the evidence at hand. I thought it was one of the best examples of Taoist principles I have ever read.<BR>  &quot;The tao of Pooh&quot; made me see the winnie the pooh books in an entirely different light, as philosopical texts in themselves. Taoism seems to overlap with many of the values i hold anyway, so I suppose I am a Taoist. Both the religion and this book reassert a sense of optimism about the physical world which is very lacking in nearly every other major religion, and much of our literature. It is simple yet prfound, truly a Taoist text in every sense.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Simply the most adventurous interesting work that Wilco has ever done. Simply the most adventurous interesting album of 2002.<BR>Like Fleetwood Mac's Tusk album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is not an easy album to listen to. This is not background music for your entertainment. This is music that forces you to participate. This is music that sucks you in. At times discordant and lo fi but with repeated listens, you soon begin to \\"get\\" the beauty of every single track on the record. Stunning, shocking, breathtaking.<BR>Buy it now. Buy a copy for your friends, buy a copy for your mother. American music rarely gets this good. A perfect tonic for our new hyper-conservative government and that idiot milquetoast president of ours.
B000002UAR|5.0|I am fourteen years old, and last year, afer reading a lot about this album, I decided to buy it. I'm so glad I did! I am a huge Sgt. Pepper fan, but I like Revolver ten times more! First of all, no song can start off an album like Taxman. George Harrison at his best, and the Beatles at theirs, too. Wow! Eleanor Rigby is pretty depressing, but it tells the truth. I greatly admire Paul McCartney and his lyrics on this song. I'm only sleeping, which I'm listening to right now, is the ultimate song about laziness. Makes me want to be lazy too! Love You To has a groovy beat, especially towards the end, plus inspiring lyrics. Pretty groovy! And Here, There and Everywhere is the greatest love song of all time! Better than \\"Something\\"! Makes me think of my girlfriend... Yellow Submarine is really the only weakness on the album, but everyone else likes it, and you probably will, too. She Said She Said is so awesome it makes me want to jump up and shout! And it's making me feel like I've never been born... Good Day Sunshine is the ultimate song about bliss. And Your Bird Can Sing would be the greatest rock song of all time if it weren't for Taxman, but that makes this monster of an album all the better! WOW, what a guitar riff! For No One is McCartney's worst song on the album, and even that song is greater than anything he ever composed, except \\"Hey Jude\\". Dr. Robert! What a awesome line: No one can succeed like Dr. Robert\\"! John Lennon definitly scores another touchdown with this song. I Want to Tell You is an awesome song, with the greatest lyrics of the album, except maybe Taxman. GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE is so full of spirit that I almost shouted out loud at the ending one time! And then, the ultimate song of the changing 60's. The LSD song. The most experimental song I can think of, and the experiment was indeed a sucess. WOW! Even on the Beatles Anthology 2 it sounds awesome! The lyrics are bad, but it still inspires me. I listen to it on the way to school wheneverI have a Math test. It works. The only thing wrong with this album is the cover.  It's very well done, but is it attractive?  Sgt. Pepper and Rubber Soul have much better covers(and can we forget Abeey Road!)<BR>Revolver is the GREATEST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME! YEAH! BUY IT!<BR>\\"Perfection\\" is not an overstatement!
B000069AUI|5.0|If Wilco's &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is in your collection and you buy Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, then you have the two best albums of the year.<BR>Coldplay's second effort is a stunning piece of work: one of those albums that shines from start to finish. Think &quot;Rumours&quot; crossed with &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and you'll get an idea of just how good this collection of Chris Martin songs is.
0312265859|3.0|I love Janet Evanovich's writing. I was thrilled beyond words when I read, \\"One For The Money\\" and still a happy camper with \\"Two For The Dough\\". But after reading High Five, I suppose I should have stopped there, because I jumped to Hard Eight. This means I still haven't read 3,4, 6 and 7. It may be a while before I got back and read these novels, although I own 3 & 4.  Maybe I'm thinking the characters and the storyline is beginning to get too repetitious for me. She's still having her on-again/off-again fling with Morelli; she's still chasing the FTAs and depending on Ranger to bail her out of trouble. And just how many cars is she going to destroy and he will keep replacing? The only thing different in this book is Stephanie paying her debt to Ranger for his help with her body and that wasn't some of Janet's greatest writing either. I would have thought she would take more time with this scene and she didn't. The ending of the book was just cut off like she was tired of writing about it and ended it there. I think Janet's humor and wit are the greatest and I do enjoy her writing. But this book didn't do it for me like some of her others and in all fairness, I'm not sure if it's her or me. I'll read more of her work later on, but after Hard Eight (and I couldn't connect the title with anything in this book either), I'm due for something different.
0790731983|5.0|If anyone ever doubts that Liza Minelli deserved her superstar status way back when, Cabaret erases those doubts. Now the butt of late-night humor, Minelli was at her peak of looks and talent when she starred in this brilliant Bob Fosse film.<br />The movie, adapted from the hit play, is a chilling look at a Germany that is just on the cusp of Nazi takeover. Set in Berlin, it tells the story of Sally Bowles, a cabaret singer whose bawdy, rowdy, brilliant stage presence is matched only by her even more excessive personal life. The almost nightmarish look of the tawdry but popular nightclub in which she works is matched by the underlying hysteria of its musical numbers. Joel Grey is absolutely brilliant as Sally's foil: the club's spooky star, whose act is cheap, witty, and lurid.<br />Against this backdrop of frantic fun is the very real and chilling story of two innocent young Jews whose romance is about to crumble in the face of the Holocaust to come. They know they must escape--they just don't know how truly doomed they are. Marisa Berenson is exquisite as the young woman, so scared, and so in love.<br />Michael Crawford plays a British journalist, in Berlin on assignment. He is the exact opposite of Sally--straight-arrow as they come--but he becomes entwined in her life, her tragedies, and her very real vulnerabilities, which Liza revealed to perfection in the midst of dancing and singing her heart out. The film garnered eight Academy Awards, including one for Liza, and for once, it deserved every one it got.<br />This is a classic film, as brilliant today as it was at its debut. Liza was no flash in the pan, and her incredible talent was never as fresh, young, and in-your-face as it was in this movie.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|Look, anyone who disses eminem hasn't listened to his music. Yeah, he has some tracks that are just totally mainstream and commercialized, but the man has skillz. Listen to his words, how does this kid come up with this stuff, crazy! but anyway, this cd is worth the buy, i was skeptical at first being a soundtrack, but when i heard 50 cent was on it, well i had to hear what all the hype is about, and i have to say these tracks by 50 cent alone is worth it.
B000001FS3|5.0|I've had this CD since it originally came out, and it's still such an incredibly great album.  I own 8 or 9 U2 collections, and this has to be my favorite.  Besides the well-known hits, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; really show the passion of this band. <br />It will always be an essential album for any collection.  There isn't a bad song on it.
0316666343|4.0|Parts of Alice Sebold's story of murdered 14-year-old Susie Salmon, watching from heaven as her friends and family live out the life she never got to finish, felt so true they took my breath away.<br />The author painted a sad and beautiful picture of Susie's plight. Though Susie is in heaven, where anything she wants is only a wish away, she cannot let go of earth. She feels cheated out of growing up and watches with both love and jealousy as her friends and family experience everything she never will.<br />This portrait of Susie is the truest. The first three-quarters of the novel are so delicately beautiful they practically float. I found myself feeling a deep attachment to this child yanked away from her life in its midst and to her grieving family.<br /><br />But then the author took a strange, Stephen King-like turn. Sebold started letting Susie and her friends do things that shattered the believability of the world she had, up to that point, so elegantly described. I was so enamored of Susie -- and the world she lived in -- that I felt cheated by this violation of the rules. My eyes stopped gleaming with sad, quiet rapture. Instead, my brow wrinkled as I tried to figure out why the author was trying to destroy the novel I had grown to love.<br />Maybe she was so fond of the characters by the end of the novel that she felt it only fair for everything to work out perfectly, I thought. Maybe she just had no idea how to end her story. Maybe she got very, very tired and didn't care anymore if her book made sense.<br />Until I reached the last fourth of the book, I had sung its praises to everyone who would listen. But suddenly, as the novel disintegrated before my eyes, I felt almost angry. A great injustice was done to Susie. Certainly, we have to see Susie grow up in some way to feel that the novel is complete. But the way the author chose to do it blows the ethereal aura of the novel away like dream fog, and Susie emerges not as an adult, but as a merely fictional creation. Until then, Susie had been real.creation. Until then, Susie had been real.
B000002L99|2.0|sammy hagar is an able blues-rock singer and guitarist in his own right, but david lee roth he ain't. gone are the double entendres worthy of bon scott, gone is that signature wail, gone is the struggle for prominence between the charismatic vocals and the phenomenal guitar work. truth be told, the blame for this album can hardly be restricted to sammy. alex van halen began a slide towards mediocrity in his drumming here, turning into an increasingly bland boogie drummer. compared to the varied, gutsy drums on the band's self titled album, this is downright embarassing. there remains little bass to speak of and eddie's guitars tend to overwhelm the music, which doesn't work very well because he hasn't got any particularly good compositions. all of the sudden, van halen wasn't pioneering the music that the bands of the eighties then atempted to replicate anymore - they were playing by those bands' rules, becoming JUST ANOTHER BAND. <BR>if you aproach this album with no expectations, it may strike you as reasonably good hair metal album. this should be a good thing but keep in mind: for years before this, van halen had been satisfying, then EXEEDING the high expectations they created for themselves with their relentlessly creative, exhilarating reinvention of sixties pop and seventies hard rock, culminating in the imortal 1984 album. for fans of the original van halen, 5150 is nothing short of painful to listen to.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark Knopfler, the creative heart of the Dire Straits group, continues to record fine work in the Celtic-blues-country-folk-contemporary-rock vein (hey, you try to characterize his style better than that!).  While none of the individual tracks on &quot;A Ragpicker's Dress&quot; quite grabs me as much as the title cut on &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia,&quot; this is still a top-notch addition to his body of work.  Another reviewer noted the phenomenon of Knopfler's recordings growing the more you listen, and I have already found this to be the case with &quot;A Ragpicker's Dress&quot;.  I'm on my third listening at the moment and it just keeps getting better.
B00004YW6I|4.0|pj harvey's 'stories album is largely made up of mellow, new york centric songs about the big apple, love and love in the big apple. there are four rockers, all in pairs. kamikaze and this is love manage to be engaging and honest while making good use of the gutsy guitar work. the two songs opening the album, however, are destroyed by stiff druming. <BR>some of this material is memorable, some of it isn't. what's nice is that when harvey hits her stride, this stuff is in a totaly superior class. <br />the best song on the album is a duet with thom yorke that almost makes all those overrated radiohead albums ok, called this mess we're in. <BR>pj harvey provides a somewhat uneven, but deffinitely interesting album.
B00006IR5S|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks ever produced, even without images from the movie to go along with the soundtrack (since the movie hasn't been released yet) the music tells the story in a new way.  Although there is dissapointment in the fact that there isn't a track with the quidditch match in it,this soundtrack is complete and is a must have for harry potter/john williams fanatics.

Any of you who don't like this cd needs to get a better taste in music... my 15 year old brother listens to rock and hates MJ but still things the cd is amazing!! Well hope you all buy this cd!! Buh byez!!
B00006M183|5.0|If you have not bought a PJ album since Ten please move on because you are not a PJ fan at all.  PJ has evolved into much more than Alive and Jeremy.  Actually I rate No Code and Vitology as the best PJ albums to date.  That may all change with PJ latest album Riot Act.  You need only spin this record once and you will fall in love with each song, maybe not the last one but PJ is know for a weird song on each album.  Riot Act encompasses Eddies unique and soulfull vocal cords in each song.  It amazing how incredible his voice has gotten.  Trust me if you buy this album you will absolutely love it.  The first song \\"Can't Keep\\" opens up the show with punch and the ablum will continually get better as the tracks move on.  The ablum is phenominal....don't hesitate buy Riot Act TODAY.
B00006SFBD|5.0|On that day, the release date for the new Opeth album, I have to say one thing, I've listened the album over and over all the day and I'm sure I will be attracted by this album for a long time.<BR>First of all, the vocals, between the mix of the \\"death\\" vocal and the \\"emotion voice\\", I'm totally impressed by the capacities of the singer. All the music parts all well played and it's sound like a TRUE METAL sound, with no synthetiser and other stuff like that. It's a real metal album, a nostalgic sound for any heavy-metal fan. The bass parts are so dark and hanging for the ears. All the 6 tracks are kick ass, especially \\"Master's Apprentices\\", a beautiful mix between the death-metal and progressive-metal. As a whole, this album possess a remarkable talent, an imposing sonority, a legendary passion and a good brutal sound. I've discovered this band with this album, and I know that I'll buy all the albums that I'll can grab! I'm blown away by this band and I believe that this band represents the future of true-metal. Don't waste anymore your money to buy other bands that doesn't have the capacity to write songs and great riffs like this band, Opeth. Go to buy this album, it worth the cost 10x!!!

B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam has a strange (and fortunate) habit of constant change- no two albums in their arsenal sound alike (possibly excluding the 72 bootlegs- even that's questionable). Some of their albums are instantly striking (\\"Vs.\\", \\"Yield\\"), while others need to grow on you (\\"Vitalogy\\", \\"No Code\\", \\"Binaural\\"). I proudly say that \\"Riot Act\\" is in the former category. The album closely resembles Live's recent \\"V\\" in which the band experiments a lot more with techno that in the past- fortunately, Pearl Jam knows how to pull this kind of album off, unlike Live.  I really wish more people would buy this album- it has sadly sold only 400,000 copies to date.<br />Can't Keep- The album's opener and one of its best tracks.  It has a steady build but never quite explodes, which actually makes it seem even better<br />Save You- A great rocker that's very loud and fast; I hope this one's a hit<br />Love Boat Captain- The best song on the album.  It both rocks and is emotional, and has a great tune and chorus.  I can't wait to hear this one live<br />Cropduster- I actually like this song, as it's gotten mixed reviews on this site.  The lyrics are very good, and the music is a nice, steady mid-tempo<br />Ghost- One of the album's weakest tracks.  The chorus and some of the lyrics are good, but little on this song stands out<br />I Am Mine- A great track.  The music has a very classic rock feel, and is overall just pleasant to the ears :)<br />Thumbing My Way- Pearl Jam tries out country and succeeds.  One of the best ballads they've ever done<br />You Are- The album's strangest song- it feels like Soundgarden crossed with techno.  It has grown on me, but I still don't think it's one of the album's best<br />Get Right- Not a great song, but a very good one.  It rocks loud and has a very cathcy chorus<br />Green Disease- A terrific political song about the evil rich and, of course, Bush.  The music is great in this semi-rocker<br />Help Me- Another strange song, and perhaps their most interesting experiment on this album.  Vedder's voice is digitally altered- it actually works well<br />Bushleaguer- Pearl Jam's big [diss] you to Bush is actually put together rather strangely and has some bizarre lyrics.  They've done this kind of song better before, including on this album (\\"Green Disease\\")<br />1/2 Full- A great \\"Rival\\"-style rocker that rocks louder than that track ever did.  Is also infused with political commentary, and is one of the album's best songs<br />Arc- What's wrong with people?  I love this track!  With Vedder's constant wailing, it all seems strangely spiritual<br />All or None- This is probably one of the album's weakest songs.  It's a passable ballad, but they could have done better for a closer
0062502174|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend after I graduated from college and had trouble deciding whether I should pursue my dreams and open a business or take the recommended approach and get a job with a stable income. After reading this enlightening book, I give this book as a gift to one person every Christmas who seems to battle internally with themselves on whether they are on the right path, or if they should pursue something else.<br />I have read this book three times, and each time it reaffirms the need to follow your dreams by listening to your heart, while choosing to ignore your heart will lead to an internal struggle between the mind and spirit. Your life path is found in listening to and pursuing the dreams of your heart, regardless of how unachieveable they seem. <br />I enjoyed how the author stressed the importance of omens and listening to the world around you for signs from the earth and the Gods. I appreciated how the author stressed the importance of relying on our instincts and intuition to make the best decisions for yourself in pusuing any aspect in your life.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who needs reaffirmation on whether or not they are following their life path, and if they are using the tools necessary in order to be successful in all of their endeavors.
0312265859|5.0|I am a fan of all the Stephanie Plum books and I certainly enjoyed \\"Hard Eight\\"!  Several colleagues at work and I read this series faithfully and discuss and laugh about the books on a regular basis.  Grandma Mazur was her same witty self and Mom got into the action more this time by running over \\"the rabbit\\".<BR>I definitely recommend this book to all who enjoy fun and an easy read!!
0441172717|5.0|First of all, I am not one who typically writes reviews.  However, I was compelled to write because this stunning novel is one of the best in modern fiction.  There are many reasons why this novel has been loved by so many.  Most of all, Herbert's is a creation of supreme depth, describing the economic, military, political, and social interactions of a vast universe.  To my knowledge, only Tolkien has created such a detailed and believable reality.  So, if for no other reason, read this novel to become engrossed in the rich tapestry of humanity that is &quot;Dune&quot;.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Mikael kerfeldt and his fellow band members have done it once again.  Not that anyone had doubts.  With each successive release, Opeth set the bar high, and leap over it every time.  Not only is Deliverance a logical extension to Blackwater Park, it is also a return to the more death metal oriented days of My Arms Your Hearse.  I shall recount the night I first heard this amazing album. <BR>  The album began with the mighty Wreath.  As soon as that odd time signature hit, a smile crossed my face.  The song only got better.  Then came the highlight of the album, the title track.  From the insane opening riff, to the ensuing acoustic breakdown, the song was vintage Opeth.  On to A Fair Judgement.  I was confused.  Was this not to be an all metal album?  Were the depressing slow songs not to be on Damnation, their next album?  Not that I was complaining.  A break from the fury was welcome.<BR>  Next up, the instrumental For Absent Friends.  A beautiful little diddle, but far from memorable.  Was the album losing steam?  The first few bars of Masters Apprentice restored my faith.  With a Morbid Angel like riff, this was the hardest thing I had heard from Opeth since Demon Of The Fall.  And finally, By The Pain I See In Others closed the album out.  The vocals made my eyes shoot open.  Evil at its finest.  And as the haunting backwards words of Mikael kerfeldt faded, I again smiled.<BR>  Few too many people know the pleasure of an Opeth album.  Make sure you get in on the act.
0385503954|4.0|The book is a distinguished achievement by a distinguished author.  But I am not happy with it.  I find the plot and the characters and the overall atmosphere pushing and shoving and generally shouting: &quot;hey, read this carefully, hey, this is serious;  hey this is literature.&quot;  I find a lack of human sympathy, a lack of warmth.  I hope that other readers will enjoy this book more than I have.
B00005R87K|1.0|Pls note: I comment this on Alphavideo studio version I bought.<BR>The story & cinematography is - of course - spectacular as I expected (don't be hesitate to have one). Nosferatu is great for its eccentric form. <br />But, let me tell you 'bout how the disc going in my player. first, the the disc go smoothly, but at 3rd chapter (of 4 chapter) the disc begin to go slow and jump to next frame frequently. Chapter 4, I almost can not see the movie as it jump more and more worsely, and finally I CAN NOT SEE ANYTHING. Did I buy pirated stuff??? <br />I tell you this never happen on my other DVDs bought from Amazon before. ... I don't know if this is the right stuff or not, but I'm really NOT satisfied..<br />You'd better look for other studio version. Beware the kind of mine.

B000006342|4.0|This CD by Tina follows up her success with PRIVATE DANCER.<BR>She probably thought it best to stick to the soul/rock formula in 1986 too..and figures proved her right.<BR>The album sold amazingly well, the tour wich supported it ended up sometime in 1988, somewhere in brazil, with the largest crowd ever assembled til then for a single performer.<BR>Getting back to the album, she delivers great performances all through the CD.<BR>Does not matter if you're on the dancefloor (TYPICAL MALE) - or even a countrybar dancefloor (WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET) -, if you are in the bedroom with the one you love (TWO PEOPLE, PARADISE IS HERE) or driving in the car (TIL THE RIGHT MAN COMES ALONG); not even if you have your headphone set on (AFTERGLOW): she will always gets thru.<BR>Tina enlisted a little help from her friends again having David Bowie writing the splendid and glittering GIRLS, Bryan Adams bringin over the right rocker's touch to the guitar-driven BACK WHERE YOU STARTED and Mark Knopfler coming up with the honky-tonky-flavoured OVERNIGHT SENSATION.<BR>This album is just about perfect for everyone...<BR>pick your favourite environment and take a good listen to it!
B000066NW0|5.0|Although I am by no means a great fan of &quot;teen pop,&quot; the genre into which some people may categorize Avril Lavigne, it is clear that her songs stand out in one very particular way: they have a good harmony. Although this seems like a trite thing to note, I can't stress how important and vital this is for a song to be good. How many times have you heard a rock song that seems to go on and on without a single memorable measure? Just random guitar riffs and screeches by the lead singer? Or sappy ballads that really go no where fast because they're so tedious to listen to? Isn't there a reason why the melodious &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; is easier to listen and sing along to than &quot;Dirrty&quot; (okay, so the raunchy video that everyone seems to hate didn't help)? Although &quot;Let Go&quot; isn't perfect, it's a lot better than most albums of this kind. <br />Everyone has heard the first single &quot;Complicated&quot; (unless, of course, you don't listen to the radio or watch TV). It's infectious, it's catchy, it's less annoying than Britney's &quot;Boys.&quot; By this time most people might be annoyed with it, but it is inherently a good radio-friendly song that you can hum or sing immediately after you've listened to it. But it's not the only good song on the album. &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; which has that enigmatic and rhythmic introduction, could be another single, and is &quot;rockier&quot; than the energetic &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and pop-oriented &quot;Complicated.&quot; &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; sound better in the acoustic versions, but they are still good album ballads that are catchy and slow (quite a feat!). &quot;Mobile&quot; is also a good picker-upper in the morning, but without the distracting guitars that sometimes drown out Avril's vocals in some of the other songs. <br />Will Avril last? It depends on whether she and her team continue to churn out songs that sit on both sides of the fence -- quality andcommercial appeal. But, based on &quot;Let Go,&quot; she's got an enormous amount of talent. If her sophomore album improves as Pink's did, then the sky's the limit.
0140067477|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a close friend and he was correct in saying that I would enjoy it! I loved it! The book is well written and I feel that by using our favorite characters, whom many of us have loved and grown up with; together with their own characteriatics, makes the principles easy to understand and shows the way to how we can implement what is being taught. <br />I believe, we can all see ourselves in one or more of the characters and although some may not be happy to see ourselves mirrored in such a way, that too is part of our growth as well; and what I believe the book is trying to teach us. We can all become \\"Pooh like\\". To find our way, to become quiet and still and to become more child like in our outlook of life. Not to take things (or ourselves), too seriously but to \\"go with the flow\\" and enjoy life to it's fullest. <br />I can recommend this book highly to learn from, to live from and to find our way.
B00003CX9E|4.0|Welles is great, no question about that. At the end of the film there where to many questions that stayed unanswered in my opinion. Some people may find this a + factor, but I felt a bit annoyed about that.
B00006M183|5.0|I don't think I could give a pearl jam album less than 5 stars ( with the possible exception of No Code).  Now i am 25 years old and i am no kid writing this review, I could probably think of something better to do with my time than write this but I wanted to write about pearl jam.  The first song is much better than BreakHerFall off of Binaural. And &quot;Save you&quot; ranks up there as one of my favorite pearl jam songs ever.  Lately i've been listening more to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Modest Mouse, Low, and the Magnetic Fields.  But I usually buy pearl jam albums as soon as they come out.. I'm glad i bought this one it is excellent.  I hope Eddie Vedder and Co. continue to make music as penetrating as these songs well into the future.  Be like the Stones and Neil Young! Play until your 80.. i for one woudln't mind.  Thank you Ed for making my teen years and 20's a little brighter.
0767802489|5.0|I would like to say that this is a wonderful movie with great acting(particularly by Max Von Shrow) and tremendious camera shots. I first saw this movie in my 11th grade German class and was dazzled by all I saw. <BR>This movie provides a wonderful picture of the utter lack of hope with which German U-boat crews in WW2 were faced with, it also a look into how they actually lived in a little tin box 200 feet below the waves. <BR>The movie also shows that not all of the Germans were fanatical Nazis along with debunking several other historical myths <BR>One very important point <BR>The title is pronounced \\"Das Boat\\" not \\"Das Boot\\" like the things you put on your feet to go hunting. If you haven't seen this one yet go rent it.

B00005U8EM|5.0|Phil Coners hates going to the little town in Pennsylvania but he is very thankful that he is only going to be there for one day(or so he thinks).  The days start repeating themselves and suddenly Phil has been everywhere in town and knows exactly what is going to happen in the town at any given time.  <br />Phil starts to get to know himself and he attempts to make his life better, will he succeed??  Or will be forever trapped on Groundhog Day?
B00000DFTH|5.0|Listening to this record made me realize how revolutionary Toni Iomi's guitar playing is. It also showed how every other Heavy/ Nu Metal group ripped off Sabbaths sound yet fails to be as good. Iomi demonstrates how beautifully rythemic dark tones can be when a proper balance of harmony, Melody, and Rythem are applied. Take a song like \\"Into the void\\" and you find a the birth of Death Metal   however, Iomi makes it sound enjoyable since he changes the range of its tempo and then transforms it into a lead guitar tone. Like Hendrix, Iomi takes you on a musical Journey......The sad thing is that most metal fans are musically challenged because they only pay attention to doomy or speedy riffs rather then taking the music as a whole into account.......This album also showed me how vital Ozzies general presence is to Black Sabbath. This includes his whiney vocals when mixed with Iomi's dark structured tones produce an evil yet empowering sound. True genious. I Totally loved the way Ozzie rallied the crowed during these performances. I felt as if that fun energy gave each song a richer element. Gotta buy this album because this is great music plain and simple.
0380002930|5.0|The Secret Life of Rabbits <br />Wow!!  If you haven't read this book before you really should.  Primarily it follows the adventures of four or five main characters <br />Hazel, Fiver, Big Wig and Dandelion and there followers.  The cast is wide and varied and the detail is incredible.  Mr. Adams has created a wonderful story here not just a story of rabbits fleeing their home in search of a better life.  This story is also about their myth and culture and there are several chapters about the rabbit hero Elerray Ra kind of a mythological hero/ trickster god.  <br />Overall-Wonderful book, you can really have fun while you are reading it.
B0000029DD|1.0|I hate this album.  I bought it because someone told me that it was great.  It's not.  I bought this album because every critic loves this guy.  I don't.  I love all the bands in the &quot;If you like Jeff Buckley, you'll also like...&quot; box.  The problem is that I just don't like Jeff Buckley.  <br />In fact, I can't find any redeeming qualities to this at all.  People rave about Jeff Buckley.  Frankly, I don't know why.  His lyrics?  I can't make them out.  His music?  Original, but unlistenable to me.  I've tried and I give up.  I'm sorry Buckley fans, I just don't get it.  Someone tell me the error of my ways.

B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam continues to intrigue with this no-nonsense, pure rock album, which is a gift in this age of &quot;American Idol&quot; garbage which seems to play endlessly over our airwaves.  This band just keeps evolving, but at the same time stays true to it's roots.  That demands respect.  This album has a nice &quot;live&quot; sound which you don't find on many albums these days.  Right before the first track &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, you can hear one of the guys mumbling the marching beat for the song they're about to play, and at the end of another you hear drummer Matt Cameron's drumsticks falling to the ground.  It gives the album a &quot;no-frills&quot; kind of feel to it, which reflects the band itself.  It flows smoothly from one track to the next and you can just picture the band banging out these song in the studio, one after another.  My personal favorites on this album are &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; (the organ is a nice addition), the powerful &quot;Save You&quot; (a song you must play very loud), &quot;Get Right&quot;, &quot;Cropduster&quot;, and &quot;Green Disease&quot;.  This album is solid, this band is solid, and hopefully they'll stick around for a long, long time.  Thanks Pearl Jam.
B00000JHAU|5.0|The work that introduced me to Belle &amp; Sebastian is still great after hundreds of listens (the same can't be said about my cd). Seeing Other People was the track that first caught my attention on this cd, the piano work is beautiful. My appreciation has grown for the rest of the cd, but track two remains my favorite. An excellent cd by an excellent band, definitely worth checking out.
B000002HAF|5.0|. . . this one probably got heavy rotation in your CD player at some point.  If you like punk/alternative/gonzo/whatever this is some of the best.  Why do people like this so much?  Because it sounds like it was made from lunatic asylum escapees.  Mexican lunatic asylum escapees.  There is a definate Mexican flavor in the madness, a little hot sauce thrown into the mix.  Sometimes Mr. Black's voice sounds like Sting.  You know, the first time I heard Sting was when he was with the Police and listening to the way he annunciated words I was convinced he was a Mexican-American. Anyway . . . this is way cool.
0553382179|5.0|This book is EXCELLENT! I thought I was the only one living in CHAOS.  Marla just has a nice way of writing to get your attention and get you moving.  She understands our plight and doesn't discourage - but rather encourages us to take baby steps eventually leading to a warm, clean, organized home.  I've read MANY books on getting my home in order (at least 15 in the past 2 years)... but for some reason this one speaks to me.  <br />This morning I made a journal for my 6 yr old with the 10 things she needs to do in the morning before catching the school bus... She LOVED IT!  She crossed off as she went along and I wasn't constantly yelling at her to do the next step.  My kitchen has been clean for 2 weeks, my laundry is caught up and every night I have at least 45 minutes to do what &quot;I&quot; want to do before bed.<br />If you are depressed with trying to get your home and life in order, this is a great book.  I am also re-reading Don Aslett's Clear the Clutter and it now has new meaning. Now when a neighbor stops by - I can actually let them in.<br />Marla is a Christian - so there are references to home blessing and quiet times with God.  I personally enjoy her approach but I am trying to make this review generic.
B00006M183|5.0|Being a long time Pearl Jam fan, I would have bought this album regardless of the quality fo the music on it.  After an enormous disappointment with the band's last album Binural, I was praying that Eddie and the boys would get back to what made them what they are today.  Much to my pleasure, they came back full force.  Although there are similarities to Binural on this disc, there are far more similarities to previous albums like No Code or Vitalogy.  I was very happy with this purchase and think you will be as well.
B00006G8HX|4.0|Although this is not the best film in the series, that title went to the previous movie, The Wrath Of Khan. In my opinion, I think its the best of the reissued Star Trek DVD's so far. Why you ask? On disc 2, you get to hear Willian Shatner as the sorest man in Hollywood, slamming poor old Leonard Nemoy and the executives at Paramount. I am not going to ruin it for you, just watch as Shatner explains how he saved the day and what a wonderful man he is!
079070546X|5.0|Great movie! I had to buy it again, because the original one got misplaced,(must of been the divorce thing)My Daughter loves that movie, its a holiday tradition to watch it every year, so I bought it for her for one of her Christmas gifts.
B000002B7S|5.0|This is solid 80's metal at it's finest. &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; is one of a number of quintessential eighties metal hits, so popular that it's on the Vice City soundtrack! The video is fabulous, about Ozzy suffering from Lycanthropy, and turning into a nightmarish wolf. The other hits rock as well, such as &quot;You're No Different&quot;, and &quot;Slow Down&quot;. But the hidden gem in the remastered CD is the unreleased &quot;Spiders in the Night&quot;, which rocks the house, and is haunting as well! I wish that a live DVD would be released of the 1983 &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; World Tour, I would love to hear those incredible hits live. Great music while cruising down the highway, or hitting the weight room, your adrenaline will flow!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Jesus Christ, why haven't you bought this album yet? The best, most creative, most unique and fresh thing the metal world has ever seen. Absolutely comparable to none.<br />I could list all the aspects of this album that make it great, but that would be a waste of time. I've never followed a band who've kept me on my toes like this. They make everyone else look like they've been faking it.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam have never released a bad record. Some have  been better than others. Riot Act just blows them all away. I like the addition of keyboards on some of the songs and guitar solos are back from hibernation. Riot Act is the sound of a great band playing great songs. There are rockers, ballads and songs like Arc which is really just kinda like a chant. Its awesome! Buy it!
0783229526|5.0|One of the wildest rides I have ever been on.  Gilliam perfectly recreates some of the insane scenes in the book.  Depp and Del Toro are brilliant in portraying Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo.  May not be for everyone, but a must see for fans of the strange and unusual.
B00006M183|5.0|With the state of popular music the way it is today, its truly refreshing to hear a genuine, and honest rock band like Pearl Jam continuing to put out great records. Unlike the ignorant, and concrete sequential Editorial review says, this record is not about one person. In fact the whole premise of this disc is universal themes, which could really apply to anyone. There is no self-obsession, or egotism here; there is instead a consistent theme of walking in someone else's shoes, and a concrete base of emotion, which could apply to anyone. Songs range from the sharp, valid, political commentary of \\"Bu$hleaguer\\" to the deep, dark, rhymthic, blues-laced \\"You Are\\". Throughout the record, there is a consistent energy, and garage-rocking feel. Riot act feels stripped down, and yet more complex and multi-faceted than any other Pearl Jam record yet. The track \\"Arc\\" is an lush landscape of overdubbed vocals, with droning, and almost tribal sounding singing by Eddie Vedder, bereft of any instrumental accompanyment. <BR>Riot Act sees Pearl Jam covering the rock steady ground of their roots, and taking new steps in exploring into more diverse and rich musical worlds. This record reestablishes Pearl Jam as one of the best, and most essential acts in rock today.
B00006M183|5.0|What a great album.  It feels like a classic rock album!  Vedder croons, the band rocks.  I'm listening to it now.  And this feels like one of those lame reviews that helps no one... oh well..
B00006M183|5.0|Many would say that Pearl Jam has cooled off, or (god forbid) gotten too old too make valid records. But the exact opposite is true, as is exhibited on the lush and ambitious new Pearl Jam disc, Riot Act. On this 15 track monolith of sophisticated rock, the band takes giant steps forward from the sharp, and valid political commentary of Bushleaguer to the heavy, deep, dark bluesy rocking on &quot;You Are&quot;. With a rock steady flow of good garage rocking throughout the record, Pearl Jam re-establishes themselves as one of the best, and most essential rock bands in the market today.
B00006M183|5.0|With its 7th studio album, Pearl Jam gives us its most balanced album yet.  On Riot Act, the band taps into its strengths better than any album before it, and the result is a guitar fueled record mixed with crunchy guitar lines (Love Boat Captain, Bu$hleaguer), wailing guitar solos (1/2 Full, Ghost ), and experimental sounds as well (You Are, Get Right).  All in all, Pearl Jam presents its most balanced album yet, focusing on the collective strenghts of each band member.  Only time will tell where this record ranks in the vast Pearl Jam catalogue, but Riot Act is the most accessible PJ album since Vs.  A classic!
B00003CY5J|4.0|Ok, my impression is that this movie should be shorter. After some time you can predict it. There is no movement.<BR>But what a great jazz music they use: Casandra Wilson, T. Monk, Conanball Aderley, Diana Krall. I think I watched to the end of the movie just to lissten to this music. Good test Mr Oz, thank you.
0451191153|3.0|This overtly philosophical novel is about Howard Roarke.  This book describes the career of a fiercely independent architect, who exemplifies Ayn Rand's objectivism.  His career is juxtaposed with a colleague from college, Peter Keating, and is intertwined with other characters, including a unique woman named Dominique, a successful businessman name Wynand, and a famous \\"intellectual\\", Tooley.<br />Rand thoroughly describes each individual's concept of humanity throughout the book.  This is strength, and a flaw.  The dialogues are very, very contrived, and at points insulting to the reader's intelligence.  Keating and Roarke's rivalry was thoroughly enjoyable.  To see such those two in tandem, though extremely overt, was stimulating.  The inclusion of other characters, especially Dominique, bored me to death.  Even though she provides a sort of bridge between two the two rival philosophies, her intrusion into the story is convoluted and serves little purpose than to occupy pages.<br />This book contains a great message.  It's almost hard to find anyone who doesn't relate to Howard Roarke's character.  It's lack of subtlety, its super preachy and continuous dialogues, annoying other characters, all deter it from making it an enjoyable read.  I found myself glued to some pages, while trudging through others.  It's best to describe this as an essay containing fictional characters, rather than a classic novel.<br />Some people say that this book changed their life.  Fair enough, but all the philosophy and messages are presented throughout simple economic principles, historical affairs, and common sense.  The only true insight I gained from this was the definition of objectivism.  Not worth 700 pages of only mildly interesting reading.<br />Would I recommend this book?  Probably, it's not that bad, and you can decide for yourself.
B00006M183|5.0|The privilege of being able to hear the gorgeous 'Thumbing My Way' anytime you like, as many times as you like, is alone worth way more than what you'll pay for this record. And trust me, you *will* play it over and over. <br />Ditto 'Love Boat Captain,' which sounds nothing like you'd probably expect. If you ever saw the old 'Love Boat' tv series with its corny theme song and may be fearing that the guys are going for some sort of smaltz satire with this one, relax. 0% smaltz here - 'Love Boat Captain' is an expertly constructed piece of music. And don't be fooled by that slow Hammond organ opening. The song begins slow and quiet but builds, ebbs and flows and ebbs again. Net result: This song rocks. Great melody, lyrics vintage Vedder philosophy, complete with a nod to another musician philosopher, John Lennon (&quot;all you need is love, love is all you need&quot;). Adding poignancy without being sappy or exploitative is a line referencing 9 fans who died a couple years ago at a rock festival in Denmark during PJ's set (&quot;lost 9 friends we didn't know, two years ago today&quot;). <br />The opener 'Can't Keep' is another terrific addictive tune. Listen to it a few times in a row... by the third or so listening it'll be firmly lodged in your brain forever. Gotta love those minor key change-ups. <br />If you're a serious fan and know your PJ catalog backward and forward, parts of the melody of 'Save You' may bring to mind 'State of Love and Trust' which can only be good. Another great, catchy, all out rock song. Crying shame radios all over America aren't filled with stuff like this. <br />'You Are' gets your attention from the first few notes - get a load of that funky guitar effect! I understand that's a thing (drummer) Matt Cameron brought to the studio. What can I say except IT WORKS! What a cool sound, what a super funked up song. The combination of swirly EV harmonies, a dark melody, and surprisingly romantic lyrics ('I am the shorelines, but you are the sea') make this one strange little love song. Everybody I know who's heard it names it as a favorite on this record. <br />These are just my personal favorite tracks so far. I'll skip going into detail about every track. If you're a PJ fan you already know to expect nothing less than expert playing and singing wrapped around original melodies with plenty of tasty hooks, and those everlovin' EV soulful lyrics. That's what you get here, only more so because there are bigger contributions from all the guys this time around. And if you're not necessarily a big PJ fan but just like real music created by people who obviously would rather be doing absolutely nothing else, you should do yourself a favor and check it out. If you don't come away with at least one new 'favorite song' to add to your personal list, I'd be real surprised. Something for everybody here. <br />As always with PJ: Repeated listenings at worthy volume with headphones for best effect. Gets better every time you hear it.<br />p.s. for those of you who are also'B'... unless I miss my guess, the DQ influence still sneaks in here and there lyrically. Ishmael would be proud!
B00006SFBD|5.0|I LOVE OPETH.  Apart from Pink Floyd they are my favorite band.  I eagerly have awaited each new Opeth release since I bought My Arms... back in 98 or 99.  <BR>When I heard Opeth was going to release 2 cds at once, one a normal Opeth album, death metal and easy stuff and an entire cd of the mellow styled tunes and interludes that have graced their albums since Orchid.  I awaited the arrival of Deliverance and I was lucky to pick up a copy the Sunday night before it's release.  <BR>I have not been so disappointed since Cliff Yablonski stopped updating his part of the  webpage every other Monday.<BR>The cd goes like this:<BR>Wreath- opening tom rolls and Martin Lopez is off.  He's not cut loose like he has on this album since MAYH.  It is a decent song but not what I expected.<BR>Deliverance- starts good and gets quiet after a minute and goes in to a mellow part.  When it goes back in it starts to get old.<BR>Mikael also does this weird thing with his voice.  His singing voice is so beautiful but there is something wrong on this cd.<BR>A Fair Judgement- Takes too long to start.  Odd for a mellow Opeth tune.  Gets better though.  I like the solo.<BR>For Absent Friends- Instrumental track.  last bit  of peace before...<BR>Master's Apprentice- Sinister riff. Not enough layering of guitars, making it not sound like Opeth.  <BR>By The Pain I See In Others- Good closer, all elements of Opeth songs in it.<BR>It is an album that takes some time to grow.  I like it more now than when I started this review five or so minutes ago.  The guitars are not as layered as on the last 3 albums.  The drum sound is very clear.  I was mislead by the 2 song teaser on the Blackwater Park rerelease.  Maybe that appetite will be satiated next March or so When Damnation, the mellow cd hits the shelves.<BR>Best Opeth Cds:<BR>STILL LIFE- the highpoint in their career.  Best songs.<BR>MY ARMS YOUR HEARSE- The heaviest of the bands catalogue.  If you feel like spending money, get the import with the 2 cover songs on there.  Hell, get anything Opeth.<BR>BLACKWATER PARK- A great cd, but here is where the band's constant progression ended.  Viewed by many as a side step to Still Life, Black water is still a wonderful cd.  Get the rerelease while you can.<BR>DELIVERANCE- Mikaels most brutal vocals.  Not a lot of progression since Blackwater.  Takes time to like, there fore making this a hard Opeth album to enjoy at first.<BR>ORCHID- The first and my first.  Epic and truly unique for the time.  Still today, too.<BR>MORNINGRISE- My least favorite but it's still better than anything that's selling a million copies!
B00006M183|5.0|Some great music has been released in 2002 (e.g. Elvis Costello's \\"When I Was Cruel\\" and Sonic Youth's \\"Murray Street\\"). You can place \\"Riot Act\\" up near the top of that list. This is stripped down rock at its best that is neither a return to form nor a new direction for Pearl Jam. What it really is, is another great release in a long line of great rock and roll music from a great rock and roll band. The disc gets stronger and stronger with each listen.  There really are no weak tracks. So far, track 2 \\"Save You\\" is the stand out cut from the record.  However, some of the best tunes can be found on the second half, such as track 8 \\"You Are\\" and track 10 \\"Green Disease\\". Good stuff.  <br />As far as individual performances go, Eddie Vedder's vocals are predicatably top notch. Yes, he is a little more subdued than what you may be used to, but he's no less powerful.  I think this restraint really adds to the overall feel of the music.  He has such a unique voice that it still sounds fresh after all these years. Also, there are some rippin' guitar solos peppered throughout the album. Production is crisp.<br />The world of music has many uncertainties, but one thing's for sure, a Pearl Jam record is sure to please.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This CD is an amazing journey to be savored.  I first heard it driving through the Smokey Mountains of North Carolina and again a few days later in the Arizona desert. Beck picks you up and you glide through an evolution of sound and sensation.  He is maturing musically in a most interesting way and will chart a new direction in music.  A total gem and triumph.  Thank you, Beck.
B00006M183|4.0|I have to put out a disclaimer first, I gave this album 4 out of 5 stars only b/c it has yet to grow on me. Each Pearl Jam album that I listen to grows on me; so in about 3-4 months, I will probably change the rating to 5 stars. <BR>In short regarding this album, it is a finely crafted piece of work (Although I think &quot;Binaural&quot; was slightly better). What I woule more like to comment on is Pearl Jam, the band. Personally I think that Pearl Jam will enter to the Annals of music as has the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and other icons of modern music. I am exhausted on listening to everyone's comments about how their music is no longer like &quot;Ten&quot;, as if that were a horrible thing to be. What this means is that the band has matured and streamlined their music into their own genre, alternative or grunge could no longer define this kind of music. Pearl Jam's music will endure and my grandkids will probably be commenting on this music years from now and will wonder what it was like to see them in concert, as I do with bands like Led Zepplin now. Keep up the fine work gentlemen.
B00006M183|5.0|Its quite amazing the way Pearl Jam consistently comes out with new albums every two years, each one having something completely new and different to offer. This album is sombre, soulful and very honest.. Eddie's voice sounds even more *personal* and even though I just had 3 hours to listen to it, I already love it. The guy sings from within. The songs which immediately strike as beautiful (5 star songs) are \\"Cant Keep\\", \\"Love boat Captain\\", \\"I am mine\\", \\"Thumbing my way\\", \\"All or None\\" (this is the 5th time I am listening to the same song).. the rest are great too and would slowly grow with time. Pearl Jam always end the album with extremely touching and beautiful songs (Release, Indifference, Immortality, All those yesterdays, Parting Ways and now All or None). <br />Musically its close to later works like Binaural; but Riot Act is different from Binaural, though the difference is in the feel of the album and not the music. Starting from Ten, they have kept evolving (the real transformation was during the \\"No Code\\" release) to create more mature music which grows on you as you listen to it. <br />In this era of a chaos of thousand nu-metal groups crowding the music scene without absolutely any innovation in their music, Pearl Jam stands out as fresh as always.It helps the reader when the reviewer gives an idea about his taste.. Tool, Kyuss, Sigur Ros, Pink Floyd, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Opeth, The Verve, etc... are some of the other bands I love. <br />I think Riot Act won't disappoint newcomers and fans are going to LOVE it. SO RUN TO THE STORES AND BUY THIS ALBUM and see one of the best bands evolving before your eyes!!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is so awesome, I could relate to the lyrics for every single song.  Between the lyrics and her voice, this CD is absolutely amazing, the BEST I've ever heard. It's all I listen to!!  I LOVE IT!!
B00006M183|5.0|Now maybe I'm just judging too soon and out of excitement, but I seriously believe from the 2 days I've had with it that Riot Act may be my personal favorite PJ studio album. Naturally it's not as big and dynamic as something like Ten, which'll surely be a turn off for the \\"I don't like their new stuff (No Code & on)\\" crowd, but it's hardly a flaw where I'm concerned. The laid back, worn in feel that permeates the album makes for probably their most cohesive set yet, holding that cohesion through 15 tracks (a lot of 15 + track releases this year, huh?). That also means there's no instant classic on the album - no Alive or Black or what-have-you, but again, that's fine, because it make sthe album as a whole a much better listen than previous ventures (which I all loved as well mind you). Were I forced to describe this in terms of previous albums I suppose it would be a cross between No Code & Binaural, but minus the minor faults like No Code's slight un-even-ness.<BR>Comparisons out of the way, the album is, like I said, great. Everyone gets in on the writing process with Cammeron in particular contributing a lot, probably second only to the esteemed Mr. Vedder. They even let ally and keyboardist Boom Gaspar in on the fun and he contributes some nice backing parts throughout, especially on the outstanding \\"Loveboat Captain\\". McCready is in full effect here as well, making up for his slim writing contributions by soloing his ass off throughout the albums duration. The album's cohesion, it's worth pointing out, does not make for an album of 15 same sounding songs - we get balls out rockers like \\"Save You\\", acoustic non-ballads like \\"Thumbing My Way\\" (another pleasant standout), lots of great varying mid-tempo tracks (album closer \\"All or None\\" being among the best), and probably the best partially spoken word track they've done yet, Bushleaguer, which balances melody and spoken word far better than say \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" off Yield. Hell, there's even a chant-based songas the album prepares to wind down. <BR>But enough rambling - the key element here is that Riot Act is an amazing release from an amazing band who refuse to rest on their laurels, cash in on the easy road, or lose relevance. Easily the best album of the year, and probably the best of Pearl Jam's career. Now if only they'll tour with Audioslave and encore with Temple of the Dog material...
6305077630|4.0|This was a great movie! I was 15 years old when this movie came out and I've seen it a gazillion times. I am all about the 80's and what a fun time it was to live in the last of the original decades. I'd love to have this one for my DVD collection also...
B00006WUWQ|5.0|I can't wait to get this groovy 3 pack! I think the Austin Powers movies are great! (...)<br />10/10 Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery - Great Great film. Truly an original.  Mike Myers scores big with this one.  I saw this movie 7 times in the theater.  It has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and a true classic. Elizabeth Hurley is still the best Powers girl.<br />2/10 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - Terrible Terrible movie, what was Mike Myers thinking?  They just recycled all the same Jokes from the first one. Heather Graham can't act to save her life. Fat (guy)is so gross and if you close your eyes you just hear Stuart Mackenzie, his scottish character from So I Marries An Axe Murderer.  It was a really dissapointing and pointless sequal. I gave it 2 out 10 because there were some okay moments, like the Introduction of Mini-Me. I did laugh a couple of times, but I only saw this once in the theater and never again.<br />7/10 Austin Powers in Goldmember - Groovy Baby, now where back on track.  Though not as original as the first, it was good to see a fresh Austin Powers movie that didn't borrow much from he first or second.  It grows on you the more you watch it too. For instance the first time I watched it I didn't like the Goldmember character, but as I watched it more and more I began to apreciate the humor and respect the craziness of the character. Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is great. It was nice to see some who can act for a change after watching Heather Graham and her awful awful acting in the second film. I really liked the Foxxy Cleopatra character.  Though I liked Vanessa Kensington from the first movie, I'm glad Beyonc&eacute;s character was way different and not all [like prostitutes] like Heather Grahams character in the second film.<br />Those are my two cents take it or leave it, to each our own. This may not be the best way to buy the films, but I like to buy movies as sets so alas I purchased it. Enjoy!
020161622X|5.0|This book takes the reader through all facets of software development and gives practical methodologies to write better software. This book is not language specific; almost all of the concepts can be applied to virtually any language. Besides dealing with how to write better code, &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; discusses project management, team dynamics, user expectations, and a host of other topics. At only 250 pages, this book does not go in to great detail in any one topic, yet there is enough information for anyone to implement the practices suggested in the book. I recommend this book to anyone who is in the field of software development: developers, project managers, systems analysis, and even managers who want a better understanding of how the software development process should be.
B000000WJZ|5.0|\\"Siamese Dream\\" was one of the first albums I ever purchased, and I have loved it ever since. I can remember seeing the Pumpkins play on Saturday Night Live when I was 14. That performance was incredible and it got me hooked. Billy Corgan is a genius, James Iha is amazing, Jimmy Chamberlain rocks, and D'arcy is incredible. This album rocks, and you do not know anything about music if you do not own this album or think that it is not any good. ROCK ON!
0066620694|4.0|You see every week in the IT Industry, companies that were once industry darlings announcing major problems just a year or two after they were at the pinnacle of success. In this book, Clayon Christensen explains why seemingly good companies fail to embrace disruptive technologies. This book is exhaustively researched, and highlights many once successful high tech companies that failed to adapt to new trends and markets. An interesting read for anyone who seeks to prevent this from happening to their company or small business.
B00006M183|5.0|This was a really good album. A bit tame relative to the old-school Pearl Jam, but definately fills a good niche in the current music scene. It's more of a calm mix, with lyrics that are very great.
B00006SFBD|4.0|This is the first of a \\"double album\\", the second being \\"Damnation\\" which is due out some time next year. From what I've read, one is supposed to be a \\"heavy\\" album, and the other \\"mellow\\".<br />This is the heavy one. It starts of very fast and furious, but like every other Opeth release, the tempo and mood changes a lot and there's still plenty of clean vocals and acoustic guitars to be heard. The drumming is also very tight throughout.<br />After a few listens, this album is starting to grow on me. They haven't broken much new ground with this release, but that's OK because they are still ahead of everyone else.
B000069CWE|5.0|This new Linkin Park CD is truly amazing.  The remixes of many of their acclaimed songs from the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; CD are even better than the originals!  Points of Authority, With you, and Pushing Me Away are all beautifully remastered tracks featured on this album.  Listening to this cd, you can't help but nod your head to the beat....
B00006SFLV|1.0|As is the usual way with most pop culture phenomenon and me, it took me a few years to watch this one.  Boy am I unhappy I did.  After watching about four episodes in a row, I wanted to kill myself.  I'm being melodramatic, but this show would make the happiest person on earth start having doubts about their sanity.  This show was that depressing.  Teenage life, especially when you are a girl is bad enough and this show would just sort of added salt to the wounds.  I didn't like it when I was a depressed teen and watching it as an adult makes me want to throw the tv out the window.  Or, at least change the channel and watch Nigella Bites instead.  At least I could learn something from her.<BR>Jared Leto was nice to look at, Claire Danes could benefit from some acting lessons and the rest of the cast had their moments, but this was really nothing special.  <BR>An hour of dysfunctionality, highlighted by Claire Danes making some face, that was supposed to convey some emotion.  Then, she would pull her plaid shirt in tighter and say \\"like\\" all the time.  <BR>Fine television.  <BR>Daria and Beavis & Butthead were funnier.  Ab Fab had a teenage daughter-who really had a right to pout, but didn't.  At least Daria and Saffy stood up for themselves-instead of making faces and giving out these ridiculous teenage bromides like \\"sometimes, the most truthful people can be so dishonest.\\"  Almost like meeting the Dalai Lama hearing something like that-yeah, right.<BR>There's a reason teens don't run the world.<BR>Save your money-if you are a teen-buy something that will make you feel better...
B000002LND|5.0|This is Madonna's first greatest hits... and what powerful hits they were too! These songs are well known and very well loved, but they aren't as deep as her later songs such as all the songs on &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; is a great remix, as well as &quot;Express Yourself.&quot;<BR>You can probably remember all the hits and the conrtoversy over pretty much every one of them, this album is essential for any fan of music.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Yes, it sounds a lot like Joy Division, yes, the lyrics make less sense than old Beck (\\"The subway is a porno\\"? \\"Friends don't waste wine when there's words to sell.\\"?). Did it bother you with Beck? Did you not like Joy Division? This is a compulsively-listenable CD, and as for the charge that they're just 80s recyclers, I'll quote the _Boston Phoenix_'s Annie Zaleski:\\"It's in alluding to these bands that Interpol find their own charms -- not as post-punk clones, but as preservers and extenders of a sound and an era.\\"
0425170349|5.0|This was my first Tom Clancy novel and till date, definitely the best. The plot is good and the action thrilling. Even though I have read Tom Clancy's other titles, I think this is the Best of the lot... and definitely better than the PC game.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Once upon a time, I would have scoured Rolling Stone and Spin to learn about the backstory here, the heartbreak and remorse that has transformed Beck from a funk-happy ironist to a painfully sincere crooner. Does he really mean it when he sings, \\"Mister Bluebird at my window/I can't hear you anymore\\"? It doesn't even matter, these songs are so affecting you won't care if they are affected. The title has it right -- the success that was spoiling Beck has turned to dross, and he's got the blues, or at least he's doing a [darn] good impression of them. Be warned, though: as another reviewer said, there is no more devil's haircut, no more [...] pants.
B00006LWSF|5.0|Slim has yet again created another hip hop classic with this soundtrack, and is slowly making hip hop his own empire (incase u haven't noticed).From the Detroit underground to worldwide success.Either hate him with a passion, or love him to death.<BR>Slim along with the affiliates of Slim shady records shine bright as the sun on this soundtrack and if the movie is half as good as the soundtrack it has to be a must see...So in conclusion.. BUY IY!!!
B000066JES|5.0|One of the best albums in the history of metal. Period. Go into battle with this!
B00005JKCH|3.0|If you're going to buy a DVD, chances are you know enough about the movie that you want to spend $20 to own it versus $4 at Blockbuster to just watch it.  So I spend a lot of time reviewing the additional material that comes with a DVD.  In my opinion, that's what makes a title worth owning.<br />In the case of Spiderman, the extra material was just bad.  The outtakes had no context, the gags weren't really that funny, and the stuff around the comics version of Spiderman was just dumb.  Do I really care about Peter Parker's loves from the comic books?  Do I want to see the tryouts for the roles?  Where is director's commentary?  How about interviews with Stan Lee?  How about extra and deleted scenes?  Production stills?  It's not like Spiderman didn't get enough hype before the movie was released or that they didn't have scads of material to draw upon.  But Hollywood's baiting of the public by selling 2 DVD versions and 4/6/8/10 DVD versions of the same movie is just pitiful.  It seems a rather quantum leap for movie types to think that there are people who want the MOVIE and people who want the EXTRAS.  SO why not sell a ONE disk version with movie only for a cheap price and a version with WELL DONE extras for more?  At this rate, I'd rather wait for my Blockbuster to sell the already viewed versions and buy my DVDs for $10 rather than paying an extra fee to the greedy Tinseltown execs for the privilege of shrinkwrapped junk.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This Has To be one of the best greatest hits albums i have heard in recent times it is truley a modern classic for future generations to listen to the great mix of tracks inculding the last 3 live sounding songs (but they may justy be unedited to get the real voice of one mr cobain on to a album if this album dont go down in history then i want to know who makes that decision cos i have some choice words for him form all nirvana fans world wide
B00006IR5S|5.0|Yet another fantastic assembly of music from John Williams for the second installment of the Harry Potter stories.  I think that Chamber of Secrets director Chris Columbus says it best:<br />&quot;When John Williams and I first viewed the rough cut of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; we realized that the film, at it's core, still possessed the heart and soul of the first Harry Potter film.  But Harry's second year at Hogwarts was also edgier, funnier and much more exciting.  John's score would need to reflect the changes in Harry Potter's world, while not abandoning the thematic integrity of the original film's soundtrack.&quot;<br />&quot;When you play this album, you'll hear the familiar themes that all of us have grown to love and associate with Harry Potter.  You'll also hear a wealth of new material, a glorious tapestry of themes that are filled with humor, emotion and magic.  Like the Potter novels, John Williams' new score is not a sequel.  It is a timeless classic, a rich, complex work that brilliantly captures Harry's second year at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> ~Chris Columbus.  September 18, 2002.  London
B00006M183|5.0|This is the best PJ album in years. So solid. Grover rules.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|This is Chicago's best album, quite simply. The pop is hip and the jazz is real. I just came back to it after many years away and found it as enjoyable as ever. We all know that most music does not demonstrate such resiliency. This recording can be put on a level with Chicago II and V, which is also saying a lot. As always, a love of a phenomenal horn section is key to the full enjoyment of this band, and this selection does not disappoint. But Robert Lamm's keyboards and Terry Kath's brilliant guitar (I still miss him) are amply featured to full effect. Sadly, they never again sounded so good.
B0000029DD|5.0|Definitely one of the best albums of the 90's. The songs, the vocals, the instrumentation, the production, all about as stunning as humanly possible. (and, with the vocals, maybe sometimes beyond!) Shimmering, melancholic, wistful, youthfully arrogant and angry, all these apply. In a way, the world is better off without him...the standards he set with Grace alone were too high for the rest of the world to ever catch up to. <br />P.S.  I originally wrote this review back in '99, but have recently changed my e-address, so I figured I'd re-post it.  So, yes, odds are you might not have Alzheimer's after all and that the review does indeed appear twice.
B000053VAF|5.0|I thought Dogma was one of Kevin Smith's best as a movie and as a comedy because of how it took a jab at religion and the church and how even if God saw this movie, he'd laugh because let's say it everyone has a sense of humor.<br />It stars an All Star cast of Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Selma Hayek, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jeanine Garafalo, Kevin Smith himself, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, George Carlin and Alanis Morrisette. You would think that usually, when you have that many stars, the movie isn't the same because each actor/actress is trying to steal each other's thunder, but not hear because all of them have really brought together their collective skills and made Dogma a wonderful and hilarious masterpiece.<br />It starts as Affleck and Damon, 2 exiled Angels from Heaven and follows them on their killing spree before they cleanse their souls by walking through the doors of a church celebrating it's Bicentennial. By them doing this, they find a hole in God's creation and by proving God wrong, all that ever existed would cease to be. It's up to Fiorentino, Smith, Mewes, Rock and Hayek to stop them no matter what!<br />O.k. Dogma might make a few people made because it pokes fun at religion. I have to admit it, you'd probably be more offended by the vulgar swearing before that because when it all comes down to it's just a movie and there have been comedies that have made fun of very serious things. And even so, this movie never once said that religion is bad. Again, it just pokes a little fun at it.<br />I would definitely get this one. Even if you're not a Kevin Smith fan, you'll still laugh at this one. And again for any of you that are very religious, you'd probably be more offended by the swearing first. Check this one out!
0316666343|3.0|I was reluctant to read this book because I thought that the subject matter would bother me and also that the book would be more literary than I usually enjoy. However, by page ten, I was engrossed. The storyline was excellent and suspenseful. There were even elements of humor and flashes of pure joy. Unfortunately, I felt that the ending was contrived and seemed as if it had been written by a completely different person. <br />The story begins with a 14-year-old girl, Susie Salmon, telling about how she was raped and murdered by a neighbor. The neighbor's guilt is known by the reader throughout the novel, so that element of mystery is taken away. The story is told by Susie of her family and friends' reaction to her death over an eight-year period following her murder. Susie also talks about her heaven, where she is. Her heaven features things that she wishes for - the high school she never went to, a duplex where she can live with her roommate, Holly. <br />Overall, the story holds interest, however it is literary and full of symbolism and all those things we learned about in English class. If you are looking for a mindless read, this is not it. But do give it a chance even if it's not the type of book you typically read.
0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbert possessed one of the most fertile imaginations I have ever encountered. Dune is a fantastic novel of so many layers that I find new truths ever time I read it. It won the Hugo and the Nebula awards (sci fi's top two awards), and is considered by many to be the finest example of the genre. It is frequently compared to Tolkein's fantasy novels because both authors build complex worlds containing myths, histories, and conflicts, that seem utterly real to the reader. In fact, Herbert was influenced by Tolkein.<BR> <BR>Dune tells the story of the boy Paul Atreides, a future duke whose father is murdered, forcing him and his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica to go into hiding on the desert planet Arrakis. We see Paul's transformation into a powerful prophet and leader known as Muad'Dib, and his rise to galactic prominence. The book explores ecological issues, and Herbert has said that the scarcity of water on Arrakis is meant to parallel the scarcity of oil on Earth. Many other issues and characters are explored with penetrating insight and masterful prose. This book cannot be recommended highly enough for anyone interested in a moving, thoughtful, and brilliant book.
0486282147|5.0|The classic tale of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson investigating the strange goings-on at Baskerville Hall...and, what's that howling in the distance? Is it...could it be...THE HOUND? Read, and find out the answer!<br />Great story, and you can't beat Dover's Thrift Editions price.  No frills, but classic selections!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am also not a Christina fan...However, this album is as stripped as she said it is.  She has been promoting this album to be the real her and it shows.  She has amazing vocals and you really feel her pain and emotions through her music. All the songs are great and you can tell she has put a lot of heart and time into it.  I can't take it out of my CD player...plus there are 20 songs!!!
B00006M183|5.0|After two long years of touring, Pearl Jam releases (in every sense of the word) Riot Act, an album that contains brilliant songs delivered by one of the most important bands today. Riot Act tackles tough issues: greed, George W., love, self-confidence, and, most importantly, the band's struggle with the death of nine fans at a concert over two years ago. As a result, Riot Act is the most introspective release since Vitalogy. <br />Musically, the band traverses yet another set of tangents, playing around with off-beats, guitar wails and echoes, and even an unaccompanied chorus. Pearl Jam's influences are more apparent than ever in these tracks: Hendrix, R.E.M., U2, Soundgarden, and the Beatles are a few bands whose styles Pearl Jam integrates throughout this recording. The motifs are not plagiarised, but carefully crafted into the songs with the distinct creativeness that makes Pearl Jam unique. <br />The entire track list is worthy, but the band truly shines on the more emotional tracks. \\"Love Boat Captain\\", about the aforementioned Roskilde tragedy, and \\"Thumbing My Way\\", about lost love, became my immediate album favorites. \\"You Are\\" and \\"Green Disease\\" are energetic, moving songs that will become prime candidates for tour jams. \\"Arc\\" was a pleasant surprise, and \\"All Or None\\" sticks with the band's tradition of closing an album nice and soft. <br />All in all, Riot Act is a beautiful work of art and a must for any fan of Pearl Jam.
B000001E18|1.0|This, like all of their stuff after Achtung Baby is ***. The most disappointing album ever, followed by Pop. This isn't some rant against U2 b/c I like a lot of their stuff...but this album is terrible, throw your $$ in a fire instead.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'd seen a few of Lynch's movies before, but this was the first one to really click with me- and click it did, so strongly that I was compelled to go back and revisit the films of his that I earlier dismissed. This is a complex, moving, gorgeously creepy film, and not nearly as impossible to decipher as some people would have you believe. Naomi Watts should've been nominated for an Oscar for her role, and the movie should have won Best Picture. That it didn't isn't much of a surprise, but that shouldn't keep you away. A must for people who like their movies a little off-kilter. (Okay, a _lot_ off-kilter.)
B00005UKE0|5.0|After being relegated to only two songs per album while he was with the Beatles, this \\"masterpiece\\" by George Harrison was inevitable. A true coming-out party! As George himself said \\"It was like being constipated for many years and than being allowed to go.\\" And go he did!    A must for all Beatle fans as well as Harrison fans and music lovers everywhere! At first the casual fan might be attracted to this album (I realize it's a CD) because of the more mainstream \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"What Is Life\\" but upon hearing the other tracks, the listener will discover the hidden genius of the \\"quiet Beatle\\". From the adrenalin rush that is \\"Wah-Wah\\" (my favorite), to the more middle of the road \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" - a song co-written with long time friend Bob Dylan - to the more reflective \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", this album has it all.   If your only going to have one Harrison album in your collection, this is the one to have. Buy it! It's George at his purest!!!
B00006M183|5.0|I think PJ have done a really gr8 job..<BR>Just check out these songs..<BR>I'm not saying much....<BR>Maybe the effect might fade out. But at the moment this album has me totally freaked out
B00006CXSS|4.0|I can't say enough good things about Band of Brothers.  It was such a tremendous undertaking and so well executed.  The idea of &quot;trailing&quot; one or two characters through each episode in order to better see events from different perspectives - &quot;Bastogne&quot; from the eyes of the medic.  &quot;Breaking Point&quot; from Lipton's perspective - was well conceived and, better still, well done.<br />Unfortunately, for all the wonders of the script, the acting, the directing and cinematography, the DVD just doesn't manage to carry the same level of quality.  First, rather than the letteboxed format used in the original bradcast, the DVDs are formatted for 16:9 Widescreen - effectively dropping some film elements from the sides of the screen.  Second, while the bonus features promise great potential, much of it is little more than window dressing - the maps have little in the way of detail and could have been expanded with little effort, the ranks are incomplete, the list of Easy Company soldiers, while nice, would have been nicer had it included some additional photos and possible filmographies for the actors.<br />All in all, while I'm glad to include the film on my shelf, I'm sorely dissapointed with the effort put into converting such a grand undertaking to DVD.
0553208845|5.0|Background .<br />--------------<br />Hesse's Siddhartha is a special kind of hero and a controversial one . Unlike the more regular type of protagonists that fight the elements , other humans and themselves in the process , Siddhartha's struggle is almost completely internal . Born with the graces of looks , wealth , charisma and high intelligence - he can't ever complain about or deal with any underdog position like most of the others I've come across in the past . Nonetheless , he is not happy with what he has got , nor is he satisfied . The book tells his path to achieve spiritual redemption .<br />The plot .<br />----------<br />In the book , Siddhartha is described as a free soul that is connected to everything - but not REALLY connected to anything - except for his chase after inner peace and truth . He is the ultimate happiness seeker you will ever find ; His journey begins as he and his friend Govinda leave his biological family and the company of Brahmins , in which they were raised to join the Samanas , the cult of the ascetics . After a while , he realizes that this is not his place . Toward the end of hanging around with the extremists of the spirituality seekers , he gets the chance to meet the famous Buddha , named also Gotama , which he learns to admire . Nevertheless , pretty soon he manages to throw a doubt upon the Guru's philosophy and way of life , and decides to move on .<br />He then leaves everything behind for the second time - to pursue the material pleasures the world offers . Naturally for his kind of a character , he takes it to the extreme - as he always try to get to the bottom of things - only to find out how empty his soul has turned out , when he finds out he can't think anymore , lost many of his graces and is just mundane like everybody else in his sphere of conduct . Disgusted by what he has become , he braces himself and restarts to wander again , almost loses interest in life , to finally find the inner peace he has looked for - some would say - in one of the most unlikely places of all ...<br />There are many gems that are interwoven in the story . The ones that immediately come to mind are the enlightening description of what a gambler goes through during his addiction , and the insight about the process of teaching that many times involves revealing only one side of the story to make the effort possible .<br />The book is quite short , but reads like a long one . The main reasons for this is that every page or two bear the need for a full stoppage to understand the self illuminations and deep messages that are transferred in the text , and the fact that the story sums up the major part of the hero's lifetime in a relatively short scope .<br />Significance .<br />--------------<br />Without a doubt , 'Siddhartha' requires a second reading for better understanding of what it's all about , and even then , many things might wait to be understood - in the course of a lifetime . The significance of the story is so universal and profound , that I guess that at any point in life , can one gain new insights about himself and about the world he is living on .<br />Notwithstanding , in the aftermath of the book , the reader is left wondering , and this is a big problem with the book's concept , message and perspective : Does a person , with similar targets to Siddhartha's , have to try EVERYTHING to achieve inner peacefulness ? Does he have to go through all these trials , tribulations  and powerful , sometimes brutal , emotions and stretch his experiences to the max ? Is an internal journey  - like most go through , without having to actually execute each and every thought and wish they desire - enough to finally get to the same conclusions and ascensions ? How confident of his actions and essence can a person be without challenging himself frequently , and should one really aim at this direction ? Definitely, these are tough questions that are there to be answered during the passage of years .me would say - in one of the most unlikely places of all ...<br />There are many gems that are interwoven in the story .

B000008H1Y|5.0|I have been a Jethro Tull fan since I was a Kid. I have every album, 8 track, cassette, and CD, and this is got to be my favorite. This album catches the true essance of Tull. I wish the Bass player John Glasscock was still with the band. The world lost a very talented and creative musician in his passing. I only wish I had the privelage of seeing him play. however I was too young at the time. He also appeared on the follow up  heavy horses recording with which I believe is also another masterpiece of Tull. Ian, as always is at his finest. He captures the true feelings of 17th century woodland living and mixes it with modern rock and a touch of myth and mystacism. Songs from the Wood has a very spring/summery feel to it.  If you are a Jethro Tull fan and have not heard these recordings, Please check them out, you wont be sorry!!
B00006SFBD|5.0|I was a lucky enough Opeth fan to acquire a pre-release of this album, and I must say it is a good one. They have gotten heavier in certain ways. There is no clean singing on the entire opening track; it really sets the mood for the entire album. The drummer uses the double bass technique much more than previously and there is much more of a death metal feel to this album. I would definetely compare this album to My Arms Your Hearse. It is much heavier than Still Life and Blackwater Park but much more diverse. Don't be fooled- this is definitely Opeth. There is quite a bit of clean singing and acoustic work blended with the very heavy material. I recommend purchasing this masterpice and enjoying the subtlety behind Opeth's style.
0440416027|4.0|Reading this book, one gets the feeling of sitting in a dark room that is slowly illuminating with light.  This angel is different--depressed and weary, ready to give up on life--then, a young boy and girl bring him encouragment.  It's a wonderful story of angels watching over people, and vice versa.<br />One plus is that each chapter is short, so a child with a shorter attention span can more easily enjoy.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Yes, that's my opinion. This the last record of the band that is worth a spin or a thousand. It was the last record they recorded while playing the instruments. Never mind computers and samplers, which unfortunately they became way too fond of. All the songs were infused with Smith's sticky self absorbed angst, but always intelligent, just perfect. You have only to listen to all the album to see why they were considered one of the best bands of the decade. All the songs sound like they belong together but not one sounds like the next. For bands like this, singles paid the bills, they always did; but the had the integrity to do complete work and select from it. Keep in mind that this was a double album when you notice that not one track can be considered filler. The bass, guitars and voice on this album are all top notch Cure, the drums are not bad either, slightly better than adequate. Musical Rorschach with a lot of color (mostly red and pink). Regrettably, such greatness gave them much deserved mainstream exposure. This ultimately ruined them into writing vapid tunes like \\"Love Song\\" and rehashing their old stuff in the much maligned \\"Mixed Up\\" album (stay away from that one).<br /> \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" will remind you of favorites or provide new ones without forcing you to hit the skip button to get to them.<br /> It's obvious the 80's are back. You want to ride that wave? Look no further, this the perfect board to do it on. If you are interested in original and influential material, check out \\"Pornography\\", \\"The Head On The Door\\", \\"The Top\\" and \\"Faith\\" all albums from the Cure too. Or for a sample of all get \\"Standing on a Beach\\", or \\"Staring at the Sea\\" (same thing different name for an early eighties compilation).
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is Wilco's best work... an absolutely fabulous collection of lyrical poetry... my personal favorite of all time...
B00005AWMF|5.0|As someone else mentioned, this cd does not contain the full-length album versions of some of the songs.  In some cases, the mixes are *slightly* different (such as &quot;Never As Good As The First Time&quot;).  This is because this disc contains the single mixes/edits of those songs.  Since the album versions are still all in print on cd, how nice that Sony has presented the single versions here.  <br />As to the material, I can only echo the praise others have posted.  Sade has been making good music for nearly 20 years now, though this compilation doesn't include anything from their latest effort.  Each of Sade's albums is worth having, even though some of them have a track or two that miss the mark a bit.  This cd, however, is something you can play over and over and never tire of.
B00003CX8U|5.0|The late Bob Fosse's cinematic love letter to his own excess ages surprisingly well. In fact, a few hyper-egocentric Woody Allen confessionals aside, \\"All That Jazz\\" remains a movie genre unto itself. Roy Scheider's portrayal of Fosse's barely-disguised alter-ego... a middle-aged, chain-smoking, pill-popping, womanizing choreographer/film director dancing on the edge of an impending massive coronary is nothing short of extraordinary. Along the way, Fosse's patented choreography explodes across the screen as if its creator's life depended on it (which, for all intents and purposes, it did). The opening \\"On Broadway\\" sequence has become the stuff of legend, although I'll admit a preference for the steamy \\"Air-rotica\\" sequence, containing the hottest display of sexuality outside of a \\"Triple-X\\" film (and no one disrobes...well, er, there is some brief nudity involved, but it's very, ah, um, artistic). The final 30 minutes, which could be interpreted as the most drawn-out death scene in the history of film (albeit with great dancing!) may test your patience, but no one can deny the overall artistry of this this must-see experience.
0553103547|5.0|AMAZING!!!<br /><br />Its hard to believe how good this book is!!!<br /><br />the best part is how Marin lets main characters get killed off...<br />No one and nothing is sacred for him!!!!<br />and they dont get killd in the predictable cheesy way...in the \\"oh my god NO!!!...that was my favorite character how could this be\\" kind of way...(he does the same in future books)<br /><br />nothing and no-one is safe in this series...the only sure this will be a high level of enjoyment and suspense...<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK!!

B00006V9A0|1.0|Aside from the obvious kitsch factor, there's little to recommend here.  Fans of Deborah Gibson or The Partridge Family might enjoy this -- everyone else should steer clear.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album has a handful of forgettable songs, and that's about the only negative comment I have to offer. (Save for \\"Julia,\\" the last quarter of disc 1 -- everything after \\"Piggies\\" -- is substandard Beatle music.) The good stuff on the White Album is great. <br />The album is downright weird, befitting the times when psychedelia, no longer new, had become almost customary. Lennon in particular is now producing acid rock with or without special effects; it's like his second nature. The White Album is also one of Beatles' least cheerful albums, with a dominant mood of depression and discontent. In fact the album deliberately undercuts its lighter moments at every turn -- a conscious decision, probably, after the faux cheerfulness of PEPPER/MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.   <br />The sound overall is much grittier than anything previously heard from the Beatles, but the production work is careful and consistent, and helps to hold this bizarre farrago together.  There's a \\"live in the studio\\" air about many tracks, but don't be deceived!  Listen through headphones and the heavy contribution of engineering genius becomes obvious.       <br />The Beatles in 1968 were on the verge of dissolution, and the White Album testifies to the fact that they remained the band of Beatlemania in name only. But the common canard that the album is a collection of \\"solo\\" performances, e.g. \\"John with band, Paul with band,\\" is rather misleading. Most of the classic Beatles albums could be characterized that way, usually inaccurately. What makes the White Album a bit more susceptible to this charge is that the Beatles' personalities had become more clearly marked, and more divergent, and the extra LP allowed everyone some self-indulgence. Hence \\"Revolution #9,\\" \\"Rocky Raccoon,\\" \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road\\"... and others.  Paul McCartney plays drums here, lead guitar there, piano, solo acoustic guitar... and the White Album contains more \\"one man band\\" tracks than any other in the Beatles catalog.  <br />The absence of \\"hit singles\\" on The White Album, lamented by some, is explained by the simple fact that nobody tried to issue a 45 rpm single of White Album tracks.  There's no \\"hit single\\" on SGT. PEPPER, either.  But the #1 \\"Hey Jude\\" was recorded and issued during the White Album sessions (as was its flip-side, \\"Revolution\\"), an indication of the abundance of great material the band was producing.  \\"Lady Madonna\\" also dates from this same general period (early '68).   <br />The price is relatively steep, but bite the bullet and buy this one. It's one (or two, rather) of the very greatest rock albums.
B000BTGY1O|4.0|Audrey Hepburn is irresistible in this frothy adaptation of the Truman Capote novella. An immediate box-office smash, the film was followed up a scant three hours after its premiere by the sequel, LUNCH AT TIFFANY'S.
B00006LI4S|4.0|I found this dvd of David Gilmour to be a vital addition to my floyd collection.David still plays and sings just as well as he ever has!If you are looking for a heart pounding high energy concert in this dvd you may be disapointed,but if you enjoy a very well played and layed back concert from one of the greatest guitar players,from one of the greatest bands,THAN YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE!!The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it left me wanting MORE!!as in another hour or two!
B00005JKCH|1.0|This film is basically representative of modern action hero films: lots of flashy computer effects propping up a predictable and lame story. In other words, it's a perfect example of how Hollywood panders to the lowest common denominator (which keeps getting lower). Those who were raised on video games, live in their Mom's basement with their comics collections, and can't pay attention to stories and characters deeper than a puddle will love it. Thankfully, I didn't have to pay to see it.<BR>Those who want engrossing stories and heroes, sans computerized eye candy, should look elsewhere. Perhaps Spartacus, El Mariachi/Desperado, or Clint Eastwood westerns?
0385508417|3.0|Give the guy a break! Grisham came up with a novel idea and turned it into an entertaining story. Not the sort of book that will give birth to a Cliff's Notes or a full-length feature film, but a very cozy read that will make you smile if you let it (made me laugh out loud at least once - and that's not as easy as it sounds). Like a warm and fuzzy forties movie, the corn is plentiful, the funnies tend toward slapstick and the laughs are telegraphed first. But, this time of year especially, it doesn't hurt to take a vacation from books with sharp edges and deep points.
B00006LLOG|5.0|The newly remastered version of Reed's &quot;Transformer&quot; is one of the few recordings boasting said term and actually mean it. The sound is now a lot cleaner, bursting with a fullness that it hinted at with it's original release, but never fully realized. This definitly marks Reed's depature from being the soft spoken frontman for The Velvet Underground and his acension into the flamboyant, abriasive and unpredictable Rock n Roll Animal persona which he kept until the early 1980s. A Very experimental album, not in terms of structure or sound, but rather of feeling, identity and content. Though some of it may seem cliche by modern standards, this truly is in my opinion THE album of the 1970s generation. Pure brilliance
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This was a really funny move - Ben Stiller is great as a dim-witted male model, and Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor, Will Ferrel and Jerry  Stillher are a wonderfully hilarious supporting cast.
6302373972|4.0|An evening of Lou Reed's second true film for the ears (his first being the 1973 Berlin album) caught on the aging VHS format. The music comes across with more depth and passion when performed live than on the already vivd and staggeringly poetic recording. A Must for Reed disicples
B00000J7JO|5.0|Red Hot Chilli Peppers r my favourite band and this album was by far one of the best albums I have ever heard by any artist. The instrumentation is awesome and Anthony has the best voice ever.RHCP's just keep getting better and they always will.
0375703764|4.0|Thinking about reviewing this book, I'm reminded of the popular quote about golf being a good walk spoiled by a little white ball.  Similarly, House of Leaves is a good book spoiled by an over-abundance of material.<br />Like many people, I discovered this book in connection with the CD \\"Haunted\\" by the author's sister, Poe.  The album is one of my personal favorites, and I thoroughly enjoyed making comparisons and seeing the similarities.  However, for those who have not heard the CD, I'll start by looking at the book by itself.<br />The main story (as you may have read a zillion times in other reviews) revolves around a film (The Navidson Record), which is a documentary of the experiences of a group of people in a wickedly unusual house.  What was supposed to be a film documenting the rebirth of a relationship turns into an eerie account of very strange happenings.<br />Where the book succeeds is in the excellently described explorations of the physically impossible hallways.  The madness of the characters and the horror of the situation makes for fascintating reading.  While some may be turned off by the odd writing patterns, it adds impact to an already powerful situation.<br />The book also includes a number of very interesting diversions, including chapters that focus on the science of echoes, the history of labyrinths, and the truthfulness of photography.  Also, there are some interesting appendices, including a heart-wrenching series of letters from an institutionalized mother.  The letters show the increasing mental deterioration of the character, and it's almost frightening to read.<br />Alas, as I said, the book is spoiled - if only slightly.  The book is too frequently interrupted by the \\"founder\\" of the text of the film, Johnny Truant.  While his story offers some interesting insights, the sexual escapades tend to come off as unnecessary and obstructive.  They don't add any value to the story.  Also, he tends to ramble without a sense of purpose.  Whilehis descent into madness shows the effect the story has on him, it's ultimately unneeded and unsatisfying - almost.  There is a touching story near the end he tells that just about makes up for his previous material.<br />Now, I'm rambling.  Overall, I did enjoy the book a lot.  I would definitely recommend it.  There are a lot of great insights in the book, and it was a very interesting read.<br />Now, for those who HAVE heard the Poe CD (and if you haven't - go listen to it), the connections are very interesting as you come across them.  There are blatantly obvious ones (Like the 5 1/2 Minute Hallway and the references to Spanish Doll in the mother's letters), but some of the songs seem to take on new meaning after reading the book.  I'm Not A Virgin Anymore obviously relates to the character of Navidson's wife.  And Control almost doesn't seem like a lover scorned anymore.  It sounds more like a woman gaining control over the House (as described in one section of the book).  If you try to make the connections, it makes the read even more satisfying.
B00003CXPD|5.0|My English Prof made us watch Billy Elliot in class, and I have to say this is an excellent film. Everything in this film has a purpose from the music to the usage of steel. This film evokes so much emotion that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it so great. Billy was in him this great means of expression. Even before he learns to dance, he has a rhythm to the way he moves. And one day, he finds that he can dance, and has great potiental. However, the world he lives in does not allow boys to dance. Billy knows that *this* is what he is supposed to do, what he was made to do, what he needs to do, but there are so many things in his way that it seems impossible. Through love and hope, eventually his family changes their world to allow his to go after his dream. Awesome film.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I first heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; in late May and was impressed by the poetry, the tune, Ms. Jones' intonation, and the &quot;tickling of the ivory&quot;. I considered buying the album. Fortunately for me, my brother already owns it. I was excited to hear other tracks, hoping for more gems. Alas! I was disappointed by the rest of the CD. And I understand why there is so little air play of the rest of the album: DJ's know the CD for what it is. Norah Jones tone quality is poor, and she has the annoying habit of &quot;scooping&quot; to every attack, probably because she lacks the skill to get the note right the first time, reminiscent of Six Pence None the Richer. Every track sounds the same. Poor. No dynamics. No explosions of variety, ingenuity. Contrasted to other psuedo-jazz, like Donald Fagan's Nightfly: Ruby Baby's explosive crescendos, or the staccato rhythm's on The Goodbye Look. I know Norah's album is popular, but the discerning listener will quickly regret the purchase and the CD case will become a coaster for a coffee mug.
B00006LI4S|4.0|We have to thank a lot to David Gilmour for spending time in rewriting all these songs in accoustic versions. Can't tell how attractive may be this DVD for new listeners, but it is a great gift for many Pink Floyd fans.<br />I must admit it is much softer than what I expected, but there was no dissapointment at all.<br />The video starts with David Gilmour alone in the scenary with his guitar. After a brief jaming he plays SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND with his acoustic guitar and little midi effects controlled by himself. I can´t figure out how and when he realised/thought he could play this song alone. Spectacular. For the first time I was able to see him play the guitar solo of SOYCD part 6 (the begining of the second half).<br />The other songs are great too, but as they are much easier to imagine how they will work out in an acoustic version I don't write about it.  Obviously there are some songs I find boring, and there are lot of songs I wish were included, but the DVD is a 4 STAR.<br />Another thing I liked a lot is that the crowd is heard clearly, but not enough to be anoying. Makes you feel you are in the concert. You can feel you are sharing emotional high points with them.<br />Finaly, I hope this review helps you to take the right decision.
B000003C2S|5.0|This is the best death metal recording of all time. Chuck Schuldiner was at his peak on this 1990 release. The addition of James Murphy on guitar added so much to the group's sound. Terry Butler (now with Six Feet Under) is the best bass player in death metal, and Bill Andrews is unbelievable on the drums on this album. (Butler and Andrews also played in Massacre.)<BR> All eight tracks are solid. No filler material is on this release. Scott Burn's production was great. Schuldiner's vocals can be easily heard and are not buried by the music. This album still sets the standard for any death metal release. A classic in its category.<BR>
B00006M183|1.0|how did pearl jam ever think anybody would want to listen to this [stuff]? not a single track stands out from the wreckage of this album. vedder's voice has never sounded so incapable, nor have his lyrics ever been worse. a really sad comedown for what used to be a good band.
B000068OSK|3.0|It's just not that good to me. I bought it first, and when De Stijl came out I flipped my wig...On this cd...it just didn't capture me, I don't know...but it's still way better than white blood cells.
B000002L9W|4.0|I have never been a VH fan until now.  I am a HUGE Steve Vai fan and he is the reason I picked this CD up.  I think Roth's vocals are ok and thats about it (resulting in only 4 stars) but i'm not sure its possible to pick a better band!<br />Steve Vai-Master guitar player.  He's done stuff with Alcatrazz, Whitesnake, Frank Zappa, and has an extreemly sucessful solo career.  He has appeared on over 60 cds.<br />Billy Sheehan-Wonderful bass player.  Played with Talas and Mr. Big.  He is amazing but I think it could have been Stu Hamm in his place.  Billy is more of a Rock 'n Roll type of guy though.<br />Greg B.-Is a fantastic drummer.  He's signed to Steve's lable and Steve has been on 2 of his albums.  Going back to the subject of Roth, he was awesome.  I think Jeff Cambatellie could have filled this position too.<br />All in all this was a really great cd.  So good, i can't pick a favorite.  None of the songs left me dissapointed.  Not even a mildly bad song.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Cool biz. This live album (to me) allows for the room nessesary to allow these songs to &quot;breathe&quot;.  I love all the Portishead recordings but this seems the most &quot;real&quot;. The studio albums seem a bit clausterphobic compared to these live performances.<BR>I saw them (first row) in Detroit later on in this tour, and it was simply stunning with churning dynamics, moments of stark beauty, and of course Beth Gibbons chain smoking throughout.<BR>If I had to choose one I'd take the live album.<BR>Also, the mixes to many of the songs are a little different from the CD versions to the DVD versions.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Ok...I admit it.  I have every one of these songs on other CDs and yes, even other compilations...but I bought it anyway.  And I am happy, but not surprised to say, that this collection of hits still comprises the best &quot;new&quot; CD out there...no competition.  What a great experience to listen to these songs one right after the other.  It really is a stunning achievement for Elton and Bernie.  Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Elton's hits just sound so fresh...the poetic, timeless lyrics paired with one of the greatest voices in rock and roll, not to mention astounding piano player. <br />I also confess that I reflect on the song selection much like the selection played at an Elton John concert.  I love what he plays, but am always convinced that he could have executed an equally powerful and satisfying performance if he played all the songs he chose not to play at the concert. So there are, in my opinion, many greatest hits not included in this 2 disc set: &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; &quot;Healing Hands,&quot; &quot;Club at the End of the Street,&quot; &quot;The Last Song,&quot; &quot;Simple Life,&quot; &quot;Empty Garden,&quot; &quot;Blue Eyes,&quot; &quot;Pinball Wizard,&quot; &quot;Wrap Her Up&quot; (with George Michael),&quot;Candle in the Wind 1997,&quot; &quot;Take Me to the Pilot,&quot; &quot;Amoorena,&quot; &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot;...and the list goes on and on...but then again, if all of these were included, you'd be putting a box-set together, which already exists.  <br />Truth is, Elton John's 32 year catalogue is inexhaustible. That being said, this collection is stellar.  What is striking is that the second CD, taken mainly from the 80's through present day, is as strong as the first, which contains all the 70's hits.  Unfortunaltey, it is rarely ever said that Elton's later works are just as important as his earlier works.  Side by side, song by song, this CD makes that point crystal clear.  The beauty of &quot;Daniel&quot; is equally matched by the sweetness of &quot;Nikita&quot;; we can hop and bop to the &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; and snap our fingers and mean it to &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot;; we soar into outer space with &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; and glory in the orchestral intensity of &quot;Believe&quot;.<br />There's no talent equal to Elton John.  Listen for yourself!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've never been to war, and I've never served in the military. But I have to thank those who did for putting themselves before anything so that I can live without fear.<br />This film is by far the most amazing account of war that I have ever seen. I can't imagine a more compelling, realistic view of what WWII must have been like. Scenery, writing, characters and acting all make this film a real eye-opening experience. The change of characters personalities over the series is something that is truly awesome from a theater perspective and saddening from a personal one.<br />Thank you to all those who fought for our freedoms, and thank the makers of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; for bringing their struggles to our attention.
0743219619|4.0|P.D. James is reknowned for her ability to combine the psychological novel with the classic murder mystery--but now and then her emphasis on psychology so overshadows her plot that it becomes hard to describe the work as a murder mystery per se.  Such is the case with THE BLACK TOWER, a profoundly bleak novel set in an isolated home for \\"the young disabled,\\" a euphemistic term for victims of slowly progressing but ultimately fatal muscular disease.<br />The story begins when Inspector Dalgliesh, himself recovering from both a serious illness and a crisis of confidence, is invited to Toynton Grange by the home's elderly chaplin; something is amiss, and the chaplin would welcome Dalgliesh's advice.  But when Dalgliesh arrives, he finds his old friend has died a few days earlier.  With little to go on except his own suspicion, Dalgliesh slowly, grudingly begins to investigate... and finds one suspicious death after another.<br />The premise is a classic set up, but in this novel James places Dalgliesh more as an observer of the inevitable than as a detective, and when the solution arrives it does so more by intuition and assumption than by logical deduction.  But if this element is weak, the overall novel is very strong: moody to the point of despair, and peopled with painfully pitiful characters, THE DARK TOWER is perhaps one of James' more memorable novels in terms of style alone.  Flawed, yes; recommended nonetheless.  But be forewarned: you may need prescription medication to escape the sense of depression the novel creates.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John is one of the energizer bunnies of Greatest Hits albums with now his fourth out. So why would we want this one when there is already Greatest Hits, Greatest Hits 2 and Greatest Hits 1976-1986? Because this is a superb collection of music from the span of his career, all in one place. In many ways this is like a boxed set, without all the esoteric extras and alternative takes. It's pure, simple pop hits from one of the leaders of Pop Music making for the past 32 (32!!) years.<br />Disc 1 is pretty much stuff that was on Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits 2 (though those two albums give 5 more songs that didn't make it here), and cover the heyday of John's career, before he focused more on being a consummate songsmith rather than a over the top entertainer. Disc 2 gives us some of the Greatest Hits 1976-1986 (or Greatest Hits 3), but then it explodes in presenting John's work of the past 15 years, when he spread his wings into songs for Disney, and Aida, as well as his continued explosion with Songs from the West Coast. Although Disc 2 seems a bit more padded, NONE of the songs are clunkers.<br />Disc 3 is almost an last minute add on of things &quot;we wanted to put on the album but we ran out of room for.&quot;  Greatest Hits? Nah. Just versions of good songs.<br />Anyone can quibble over the choice of songs for a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package. Yes, it's disappointing that &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; is not there (it's on Greatest Hits 2). And I certainly could have done without his live version of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; from Australia - this would have been the chance to put his bestselling version for Princess Diana into the collection. But in his favor, unlike many other of these albums, Elton doesn't put on that one new song that you have to buy the album to get. So if you have all the albums already, you're set.<br />If you love Elton though, this is just a great handy collection to throw on and relive the fun of pop music.
B00006HBUB|1.0|This movie contains a highly rude and rather long scene of Scooby and Shaggy enjoying themselves in a contest of who can belch the loudest and pass the most gas.  I deeply regret purchasing this movie due to the effect this scene has had upon my two young children.  I have been fighting and condemning rude behavior ever since...
B00005TT77|3.0|Aside from the fact that anyone else playing the Beatles songs could never be anything but a nostalgia trip,  this disc starts well but never really takes off.  Some of the renditions of songs are really great-I like Aimee Mann and husband Michael Penn singing &quot;Two of Us&quot;.  Sarah Maclaughlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot; is consummately professional if ultimately lacking any emotion whatsoever.  Rufus Wainwright sounds great on &quot;Across The Universe&quot;, at times very similar to Lennon.  Ben Harper, The Vines, Stereophonics, Ben Folds, and The Black Crowes all do a nice job as well.  But what are we to think of Sheryl Crow's awful &quot;Mother Nature's Sun&quot;?  Is it just me or was she shrunk down to a seven-year-old by the ray-gun in &quot;HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS&quot;!?  Also, the Chocolate Genius, Grandaddy, and Howie Day versions are at best forgettable, at worst, blasphemous.  This disc has its moments, but overall it is average.  Use caution...
B000005JA8|5.0|Yes yes yes. It's cacophonous, it's gritty, it's unpleasant. Put it on at a party and watch people make a mad dash for the door. Just try and dance to some of the arhythmic beats that fill the album like a car being thrown down a large flight of stairs. It's not popular music was never meant to be and will never apologize for not being so. It is as about an acquired taste as you can get.<br />Nonetheless, I truly think this will be one of the albums that survives the twentieth century. I think people will still be listening to this in a few hundred years when the concept of music changes and dissonance and staggering rhythms are as harmonious as the choir in the fifth plane of heaven. Rock has produced nothing like this up to this point. Nothing with this sense of exploration and personal vision. Nothing as playful, nothing as fun. Nothing that stretches the boundaries of what people think of as 'rock music.'<br />I don't think 21st century music listeners in America are ready for this. To truly appreciate this album for what it is you need to have a different definition of music and rhythm from the norm. No words will prepare you for how jarring it is. Your friends will hate you, people will think you're insane or on drugs (Beefheart, by the way, was not a drug user even in the early 1970s). My girlfriend still won't allow me to play it when she's home. People plain wonder what's wrong with me. Why would I listen to such tripe? Such ridiculous trash?<br />The answer is that if you're one of those like myself that discover what's in this music, you simply can't stop listening. It's not for arty reasons, or reasons of influence (I could care less who Beefheart influenced, to be honest), or showing off my tolerance. There really is something here for those who can find it. I get more and more from every listen.
6304366027|5.0|I am suprised every time I talk to someone about New York, New York, they tell me they havent seen it! I know I come from a different generation being the young age of twentythree, but I am a devoted fan of Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro. Being another collaboration from these two cinematic greats should lead you to believe more of the younger movie buffs should have seen it by now. We all talk about the usual Scorcese pics and gawk over how amazing Taxi Driver or Goodfellas is. On that note I just want to brag about the beautiful and touching picture about two creative people and their struggle to love each other and at the same time be creatively successful. Liza Minnelli is brilliant as Francine Evans and does nothing to bring the picture down. In fact after Caberet, this is the only other role I've seen her in. In any case she doesnt disappoint and actually comes off very sexy! Her eyes glow throughout he entire picture and especially in the opening ballroom scene. Robert DeNiro is always great as we all know but he really suprised me here with the character Jimmy Doyle. His razor-sharp toungue spits out the mostly improved dialogue with such fury that it sets the screen on fire. He is also very, very funny. Its also a very personal film obviously to Scorcese considering that it practically mirrored his personal life at the time of filming. Im not going to go into details but if you are a Scorcese admirerer, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. All in all, this is a movie that every movie lover, young or old, should get aquianted with. Scorcese's deft direction, along with the trancendant art direction and performances and with all the music including the title track, this is one gem you shouldnt miss!
B000002J1M|5.0|Genesis'  history must be one of the strangest in rock . The band starts out making mostly beautiful music tinged with elements of classical music (i.e., &quot;Art rock&quot;, as I've heard it called) - then after Peter Gabriel's departure the band becomes pop darlings under Phil Collins.  Genesis was a band I hated in school (i.e., the &quot;Abacab&quot; and &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; era). It was a long time before I knew the origin of Genesis (that's an interesting phrase). I was completely shocked at what I found: Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel in the same band playing amazing music.<br />If you want to explore Genesis' early days, Foxtrot is probably the one to start with. The over 20 minute &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; flies by without ever seeming overlong or repetitive. It's a rock suite (whew - my pretentious detector just went off) that's really about 10 songs combined together thematically. It's sprinkled with such lines as &quot;We're the gods of Magog, swarming around.&quot; They don't make music like this anymore. It's music you can listen to and catch nuances in. It's not purely for rocking your brains out (but you can do that if you want to).<br />The recordings have a terrific rough edge to them that probably saves them from the art rock dustbin that a lot of acts from this time have fallen into. Had they been too polished and slickly produced they may be somewhat more unlistenable today.<br />It's sad that this is music from a bygone era. I was in my single digits when it was originally released, and obviously way too young to have appreciated it. No record company would release such gems today - they would only make 5% profit, which isn't enough to buy a small country, so why bother?!?!? Not only that, but Genesis was brilliantly strange in their early days, and sometimes scary (some of Gabriel's stage outfits were straight out of nightmares).<br />Good stuff. This is music to listen to over and over again.

B00005JKCH|3.0|SPIDER-MAN raked in another ... million in just the first three days of it's home video release.  That brings the world-wide gross to about a billion bucks.  An off the chart figure.  So what is it about this story that connected with a global audience on such a stratospheric level?  Was it the marketing, the name recognition from the seemingly endless series of comic book incarnations or something else?<br /><br />If the film does not hold up as well as one might guess on repeated viewings, the metaphors for the frustrations and fantasies of male puberty come though even clearer.  Perhaps more than anything, this film is a romantic rite of passage; almost tribal in its subtext (the ritual spider bite and the shamanistic hallucinations of flying and fighting demons) but in a post-modern garb.<br /><br />But does it all add up to anything?  Not really.  Perfectly directed by super-visualist Sam Raimi (a master of the floating camera), and with nice, understated, naturalistic performances by Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.  These two actors exude a rare and apparently authentic chemistry in their scenes together.  Inexplicably, Maguire is missing on the entertaining audio commentary with Raimi and Dunst. Interesting but rather ordinary making-of and behind-the-scenes extras on the second disc.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I'm a recent convert to Johnny Cash, so don't have years of listening experience.  I can say, however,  that I've never been so moved by a single work.  &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,&quot; is simply so moving and beautiful, I had to stop listening to it.<br />This feels like an intimate concert with an incredible man.
B00006AW2M|4.0|Interesting CD with a rotten title. However, the album captures the full atmosphere of 1967. I have always felt that \\"Dandelion\\" & \\"We Love You\\"- the latter featuring John Lennon & Paul McCartney on harmonies, would have fit snuggly on this cool little time piece. By adding those two tracks and dropping the ridiculous \\"Sing This Song All Together (See What Happens)\\" would have made the album less cluttered. The original vinyl had the famous 3-D hologram front cover. Psychedelic indeed! I picked up the original monophonic Canadian pressing which has the three dimensional cover as well. Yes, it sounds a little different. The Rolling Stones attempt at \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is fascinating but it does fall short in many places. The band over induldge on instruments they obviously never had much time to learn and the result is a mess. Still, they manage to deliver some great songs like \\"She's A Rainbow\\" (one of the Stones' best tunes), \\"The Lantern\\", \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\", \\"In Another Land\\" & \\"Citadel\\".
0553801481|5.0|I've just finished this book, the seventh in Hobb's magic world of intrigue, romance and balls-to-the-walls action.  They've all been well written, well plotted and imaginative, with this Fool's Errand as good as the original Assassin's Apprentice.  Read them in order, though -- they're all worth it.<br />Hobb's style is a kind of cross between Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea trilogy and Robert Jordan's massive Wheel of Time.  She has Ms. Le Guin's heart wrenching purity and characterization, and she has Mr. Jordan's fine story telling and action sequences.  Painfully, she also has George R. R. Martin's exquisite sense of tragedy, crashing the reader into despair on a regular basis, then lifting them back to a peak of relieved joy.<br />I realize I've just compared Ms. Hobb to three of my favorite modern fantasy writers.  She may be the best of the lot.  Read these books.
B00006690F|4.0|I am a mother of a 16-yr old boy who loves Eminem. I'd never listened to his other albums, but I wanted to know what the fuss was about- so I bought it. I'm probably the only kid's mother in high school that listens to Eminem- in my town, anyway. AND- I really liked it. The language is a little rough- but the message is truthful and passionate. I can relate to some of it...and it provoked a conversation between my son and I on why people feel threatened by Eminem and why people sing the lyrics they do. Anybody that can get a conversation and thought process out of my kid is okay on my list.
0385470819|5.0|Near the rural town of Clanton, Mississippi, little Tonya Hailey is brutally raped, beaten, and left for dead by two drunken and remorseless men. The rapists are almost immediately caught in a roadside bar, where they have been bragging of their exploits. When the men appear in court days later, Tonya's father Carl bursts out of the courthouse basement, and executes them with an assault rifle. Murder or execution? Justice or revenge? Carl trusts his life to only one man in town - local criminal lawyer Jake Brigance, who dreams of famous cases, headlines, and the big time. Jake is about to face the fight of his life, and he knows it. Not only is he up against Rufus Buckley - a tough, ambitious district attorney who realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office - but he has a much bigger problem: the rapists are white, the judge is white, the jury is white - and Carl is black. This is a trial sure to change forever the lives of everyone involved.<br /> A Time To Kill is a riveting novel that challenges everything we think we know about justice and equality.
B0000026CM|5.0|Every ten years or so an album comes along that reminds me of all things good in music.  I bought this album in 1988.  Only recently while going back through my CDs did I come across it again.  In the 14 or so years that have past since this album hit the streets, many many bands have come and gone and tens of thousands of songs, good and bad, have been played but few albums that I have listened to over the years still give me goosebumps like The Seventh One still does.  I'm not sure if it is hearing the brilliance of Jeff Porcaro on Mushanga or the impecable drive of Steve Lukather but what ever it is everyone needs to hear it. <br />If you can only buy one album this year, buy this one.  If you have it already and haven't listened to it in a long time like me, pull it out and pop it in.  Let the music take you back.  You will be glad that you did.

B00005YW4H|4.0|There's something about the music of Norah Jones that speaks to you. In a world where the music industry has become so commercialized and marketed, it's a true pleasure to experience Blue Note Records's biggest star. It would be a drastic understatement to say that Norah's music is mature way beyond her 22 years. On Hank William's cover of Cold, Cold Heart you hear a jazz-inspired interpretation of the song that only leaves you humming it for hours afterward. Her vocal ability and tone are of the highest caliber and she reminds me of one Karen Carpenter in that sense. If you don't purchase this CD, you will definitely miss out. Norah Jones isn't just a musician or an artist, she is truly an experience.
B000065VB9|5.0|For a long time I didn't know how to stop listening to this album. Up until SO this is probably his most accessible record, but it's a very weird one as well. It starts off with \\"Intruder,\\" with a hypnotic drum into and suspenseful chords telling the story of a man who knows \\"how to creep across creaky wooden floors.\\" The album starts off unsettling, and then we go into \\"No Self Control,\\" a man who has OCD, with one of the most thrilling choruses I've ever heard. \\"Start\\" is a synth intro to \\"I Don't Remember\\" and it's a plot-setter type of track like those instrumentals in The Lamb lies Down On Broadway, Gabriel's stellar finale with Genesis. Then after 1:20, we go into one of the most disturbing cuts on the album, with Peter's manic howl letting the guitars in. <BR><BR>\\"Family Snapshot\\" is an emotional view of an assassin who shoots a politician before flashing back to a lonely childhood with a souring relationship between his parents, with some very emotional vocals by Gabriel (his specialty). \\"And Through The Wire\\" and \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" are probably the two 'pop' songs on the album, with catchy hooks. \\"Not One Of Us,\\" is a song dealing with conformity containing the quote \\"It's only water in a stranger's tear.\\" Then there's the mostly instrumental \\"Lead A Normal Life,\\" before the finale and ultimately the focal point on the album, \\"Biko\\" a tribute to the South African anti-apartheid icon Stephen Biko who was murdered in prison in 1977. With emotional lyrics and vocals by Gabriel, it's easily the best protest song of the 1980s, and one of the best songs ever.

080017948X|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I could only think that it was incredibly stupid, but the second time, I saw that there is a very important message.<br />As the vain, conceited, ill-tempered and mean spirited weatherman, Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is forced to live each life day after day, in a type of private hell, we see how there is a spiritual message here.<br />We are all here to learn lessons and our dilemmas will continue to be repeated until we rectify our mistakes.<br />In a sense the same theme as the Scrooge story. Bill Murray was also superb in `Scrooged'!<br />A superb performance by Andie McDowell as the movie's leading lady.
B0000024SD|5.0|Simply put, this album is fantastic.  The density and depth of <BR> Dylan's lyrics have never shined brighter than here.  The <BR> poetic beauty of the perennial folk-rock favorite \\"Mr.Tambourine<BR> Man\\" is a delight.  His attempts at less \\"topical\\" or political<BR> songwriting  (which were so prevalent in his first albums)<BR> with \\"She Belongs to Me\\" & Love Minus Zero\\" are VERY successful,<BR> the former being my favorite song on the album.  Dylan really  <BR> hits it out of the park with \\"Gates of Eden\\" & \\"It's Alright, <BR> Ma\\".  I am completely exhausted after listening to these 2<BR> songs...but that's a good thing.  The density, depth and meaning<BR> these songs hold is nothing short of incredible...one of my all-<BR> time favorite Dylan lines is from \\"It's Alright, Ma\\"...\\"he not<BR> busy being born is busy dying\\".  He not busy listening to this<BR> album misses out on a piece of mind-blowing poetry from the <BR> world's foremost lyrical genius.
0783231032|5.0|OK, OK, I admit this movie is a bit sophmoric, but if that worked in 'Animal House', why can't it work here?  I loved this movie, and those who are overly critical of it need to realize that simple humor does work.  Notice I said 'simple' and not 'stupid', which in light of recent box office releases such as 'Jackass' seem to be somewhat popular.<br />What makes this movie more poignant is September 11th.  Now, I know it isn't good form to make fun of the recent terrorist attacks, but the reaction by the US mirrors the events following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which this film makes fun of.  Trust me, I am in the US military, and people we racking their brains in trying to guess what, where and how the next attack would occur.  I read reports of people in small towns in west central Texas thinking they would be the next target.  It was the same paranoia that occurred after December 7th.<br />I don't advocate taking terrorism any less serious, nor do I want to downplay the heroic actions of those in NYC, the Pentagon, or on the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania; but we spun ourselves through the roof (and still do) with a \\"ready, fire, aim\\" mentality.  Panic does not help, and the best thing to do is cool down and think clearly.  I think this films shows us how ridiculous \\"war nerves\\" can make us all!  Well worth the money!

0812550706|5.0|*** Contains Spoilers ***  Ender's Game deserves more than to be one of the best Sci-Fi books of all time.  It has all the elements: space, galactic war, imperial powers beyond individual control. In the end, though, Ender's Game is one of the great coming-of-age novels ever written, write up there with &#34;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&#34; and &#34;Catcher in the Rye.&#34;  The story follows a young man through trials that force him into adulthood.  Ender is the perfect young man:  intelligent, angry at his powerlessness, his views fixed by his parents and society as an outcast. Through the story we see him grow, but not through contrived dialogue and classic &#34;firsts.&#34;  There is no loss of virginity, or facial hair, or &#34;chats&#34; with pop.  Ender learns to win through competition; he learns of the power of force through beatings.  He learns of oppression through futile dealings with magistrates.  He also learns of camaraderie from friends, and of himself through isolation. The two greatest lessons he learns, however, are the tragedy of the story.  He learns objectivity only too late, despite a video game that begs his attention to it repeatedly; when he exterminates a race of beings with whom he feels an unknown connection.  And he learns responsibility when he devotes his life to preserving their memory. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  It is the story of the future, but don't relegate it to the sci-fi shelves.  For it is also a story of struggle, pain, of mistakes, and of learning.  It deserves to be right up there on the classics rack.

B00006IRJU|5.0|This album is priceless.  Simply every song on this CD are great to listen to from beginning to end.  Its about time Warner Bros Re-released Icehouse's albums.  But above all, Man of Colours stands as their all time best.  Best of all this cd is remastered to perfection and it contains Bonus tracks of all new mixes and never before heard songs.
B00006FIAZ|5.0|This is one of the most perfect albums I have ever heard. Everything on this album is done so well. The atmosphere on this albums is incredibly dark and perfect. This album may not have solos, but it is so good that it doesn't even need it. Even though this band only had a few releases, I still say that they are the true kings of black metal. Anyone who listens to this album would agree.
6304698658|4.0|I don't think that this movie will ever take the place of The christmas Story but it is still an enjoyable movie.<br />All Clark Griswold wants is a nice family christmas..with a presents and family with a declious christms dinner and just a perfect family get together..and he gets it right....come on were talking about clark griswold and the Griswold clan not the brady bunch. Everything that could go wrong does and i mean everything. this movie is a family movie that will make you bust out laughing....it also makes you hope that your family get together won't go as bad as the griswolds.
B00003CXMG|4.0|This movie is one about coming of age through change.  It follows three main characters:  a young writer for Rolling Stone, the leader of a Led Zeppelin-like band in the 70's, and a beautiful groupie.<br />Each person is faced with intense highs and terrible tragedies at the hands of the others throughout the story.  The strength of the movie is that, instead of shoehorning the characters into roles and making them tragic heroes, it instead makes the events change them.  By the end, it's the Rock hero that looks up to the writer, the suicidal groupie that mothers the other two into an understanding, and the aspiring writer who fails at writing but still finds his dream.<br />A huge part of the movie is probably the soundtrack, a collection of original works and the best soaring rock of the 1970's.<br />Excellent movie.  Even when it falls into the trap of being saccharine, it at least avoids seeming contrived.  I would recommend it to any nostalgic baby boomer, confused teenager, or wild gen-Xer.

Although it takes 3 or 4 back to back listens to really get hold of it.<br />It starts with what I consider to be a classic PJ album opener (by that i mean, an interesting track but not one strong enough to fit anywhere else on the album)<BR>The Album then really picks up in tempo from the second track onwards.<br />There are some clever unusal chord structures in this album which makes it initially difficult to listen to, but its production is excellent and a definite improvement on Binaural from 2000.  <br />The highlights are : <br />Loveboat Captain (Classic PJ) <BR>I Am Mine(Played at Waltz pace) <BR>Half Full (fast rocker with Hendrix style solo) <BR>ARC (Gregorian Chant) <BR>Thumbing my Way (Springsteen style vocal phrasing).  <br />As usual there are a couple of The Who influences here and a bit of Neil Young.  <br />Some fans of there earlier work may not like the lack of repetative coruses but the overall content and quality of this album is supurb.<br />If you genually are a music fan buy and listen to this album (unless your George Bush who probably wont enjoy it)
B000002JSR|2.0|At the time of Zep's demise, it seemed appropriate to release this, but CODA really isn't a good album, but a bunch of outtakes, and it shows.<br />Some people appreciated this for the verve and raw-ness of the In Through The Out Door outtakes.  I was turned off by their lack of punch.  Physical Graffiti had outtakes that sounded like songs, Coda has outtakes that sounds like they should have remained there.<br />What is interesting historically are &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot; and &quot;Poor Tom&quot; - not brilliant recordings but snapshots from an era.  The live &quot;I Can't Quit You&quot; from a Royal Albert Hall rehearsal sounds so vivid that one hopes they will release the whole show in its entirety some day.<BR> <BR>Years later, with the release of the BBC sessions and their remasters, Led Zep did their musical legacy proud, and fans interested in exploring more should get either the Box Sets or the aforementioned BBC CD instead.<br />Avoid Coda if you can - it doesn't really do much to enhance the experience of listening to a great band like Zep.
B00006M183|3.0|Riot Act, pearl jam's 7th studio album, is finally out.  Not including the some 70 odd number of live albums they've released it's been two years since they've made an album.  The new single &quot;I am mine&quot; is probably the strongest song on Riot Act but others such as the rocker &quot;Save You&quot; and the mysterious love-ballad &quot;Love boat captian&quot; are likly singles.  I gave this album 3 stars but more like 3.5 its a okay record but not their best.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Ron Howard and Jim Carey brings a beloved christmas cartoon classic to life...the dr. suess world comes alive in this movie....the visual is stunning and this 2 disc set is packed with great features included the faith hill christms song where are you christmas...this is new classic and i love this version as much as the cartoon.
B00006M183|5.0|Amazing.  This album is simply brilliant.  Songs such as \\"You Are\\" and \\"Ghost\\" will make you want to buy this album for a buddy.  It's nice how the band shared the opportunities to write lyrics and the music to the tracks on Riot Act.  It gives the album a very fluent sound.  Standouts on Riot Act include \\"Can't Keep\\" \\"Love Boat Captain\\" \\"Ghost\\" \\"You Are\\" and \\"Greendisease.\\"  I have been a die-hard Pearl Jam fan for a year now and this album ranks among the top three out of the seven studio albums so far.  What a way to rejuvenate your standing as the most creative alternative-rock band in the world.  Go out today and pick up Riot Act.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Before finally buying my first Radiohead album, OK Computer, wasnt really into music that much, except for a few bands that i cant even listen to anymore. but, one day, i watched Vanilla Sky, and there was a Radiohead song, .... I bought OK Computer, and at first i couldnt understand it. all the great music was too much for me. so after listening one full time through, i went back to the beginning and listened again 3 more times. finally i started to find all the little intricacies in every song, and i loved it. Paranoid Android was my first favorite, and soon to follow was Karma Police, Let Down. and fianlly, i have found that the entire album is one great song. if you dont understand this album at first, just listen again and again. its so different than everything else out there that it will seem confusing. and later radiohead introduced me to great bands like the strokes, weezer, coldplay, the white stripes, the dandy warhols, and many others. Listen and Learn.
0385495323|5.0|It's said that a good writer can make any subject interesting. In \\"The Code Book\\", Simon Singh takes an interesting subject and makes it not only fascinating - but understandable. <br />Singh has a PhD in physics as well as a talent for incorporating lucid explanations into a well-told story. His book offers a historical survey of the ongoing struggle between those who create encrypted (disguised) messages and the enemies who would decode those messages. The book is a only a survey, not an authoritative history, but it gives a tremendous feel for the subject. It ranges from ancient times to present-day efforts in the mysterious world of quantum cryptography. Throughout, Singh's thorough and illuminating analogies and explanations make the encryption and decryption techniques themselves accessible to the intellectually curious layperson.<br />\\"The Code Book\\" was published before 9/11/01, but after reading it, you'll wonder if the US National Security Agency (NSA) is focused right now on building a quantum computer that can crack encrypted terrorist messages. I'm guessing they are, with as much urgency as Alan Turing and his colleageus in England worked to crack Germany's \\"Enigma\\" machine in World War II (read all about that in Singh's book). And if they succeed, it will have enormous implications for online privacy and security. Which, incidentally, is a subject that Singh also covers in an effective, objective manner when he recounts the development of \\"Pretty Good Privacy\\" in the 1990's.<br />\\"The Code Book\\" should appeal broadly to anyone who is the slightest bit curious about this fascinating subject. Encryption isn't just the stuff of spies and nerdy mathematicians, it is (and has been) of vital importance throughout history. Side note: Technology managers who want to gain a fuller appreciation for the methods and circumstances of modern-day, computer-enabled encryption should read this book.

0195145925|4.0|Julian Barbour has presented some fantastic ideas that I really like.  In a nutshell, he claims that our current framework for physics [absolute space and time] is a problem and he instead suggests what he calls &quot;Platonia&quot; as the framework.  In Platonia, time does not exist, nor absolute space.  The important thing is where the matter in the universe is relative to all the other matter in the universe [relative configuration].  <BR>  When a scientific theory breaks down, the first thing to do is check the assumptions that are built into the theory.  Given the failure of even finding a Unified Theory [or Theory of Everything], particularly with the definition of time, it is about &quot;time&quot; that physicists started examining their assumptions.  The assumptions that are under suspicion are the very existence of absolute time and space.  [Does space exist as the box that we put matter into, or is it the matter that exists and we draw the box around it in order to describe it?]<BR>  Hooray for Dr. Barbour for having the courage to challenge our most sacred cows!  I hope others will take up the challenge as it appears there is much to be done.<BR>  The reading is a bit dense at times and some of the analogies he uses were better left out [they are more confusing than illuminating].  I would have appreciated some mathematical examples.  I worry that he may have missed the mark in going into too much detail for the non-physicist and not enough detail for the physicist.
B00000K19E|5.0|The best ever fight scenes in a movie! I loved it!      Plot: The world is a dream, created by machines. A group of rebel fighters who live in the real world are trying to stop this matrix. They recruit a person they believe to be what they call: the one. This person is Thomas Anderson(Keanu Reeves), aka Neo, computer hacker. Rebel leader Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and his second in command, Trinity(Carrie Ann Moss) free his mind and bring him into the real world, where he must go back into The Matrix and defeat the dreaded Agent Smith.      Rating Flags: Violence(Gunshot wounds, Kung Fu scenes, etc.), and Language(the standard expletives).      Special Features: Okay. Not all that great.      Overall: An incredible movie! Groundbreaking special effects and fight sequences.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this movie for kids, it's just weird.  There are just too many other good movies for kids to have to expose them to this weird stuff.
B00005MP58|5.0|Since it became fashionable in recent times to adapt Jane Austin novels to film, this jewel of a masterpiece from A&amp;E/BBC(respectively) has the most interesting performances from a brilliant cast; a great script to reel you in and keep you there; elegant and meticulous art direction you'd expect from a British production; and marvelous direction which altogether affords the viewer the chance to really get attached to these beloved characters. Even those not familiar with Jane Austin would enjoy this stylish and colourful adaptation of one of her most popular works. Enjoy...
B00006JIAF|5.0|I've had a year to digest the music of the three &quot;It&quot; band sweepstakes: White Stripes, the Hives and the Strokes. Don't get me wrong; I dearly love the two former mentioned bands, but the Strokes are hands down winners. White Stripe's Jack White is the most compelling front man of the lot, with his nose-thumbing anger at the musical establishment and the papparazzi. White Stripes are an off kilter delight that blaze away with the same kinetic energy of the legendary Boston band, the Pixies. The Hives are closest to the spirit of '76 with their inspired anarchy and anti-establishment anger. You will never hear an American band as overtly leftist as the Hives. I still don't get the dopey British Invasion suits and ties, but it is a ironic contrast to assembly line hipness of other so called &quot;alternative&quot; bands. The Strokes are the quintessential New York rock band. I think comparisions to the Velvets are fair to that extent, but Julian Casablancas' voice is capable of more range and expression than most New York singers, who have a tradition of dark, atonal, sing-song intonations. The twin guitar attack of Albert Hammond and Nick Valensi are in the tradition of the clean and powerful exchanges between Television's Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd. The glue that holds together the Strokes, however, is the cascading bass lines of Nikolai Fraiture and the solid one drop drumming of Fab Moretti. This is a band with a lot of great ideas and they have carved out enough musical space to be around for years.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I love this movie! It's the funniest thing ever!!!         Plot: A British spoof of medevil movies that finds King Arthur and his knights of the round table on a quest for the elusive Holy Grail. Obviously, many misadventures ensue.         Rating Flags: Bloody Comic Violence..., Language(a couple s words and so forth) and Sexual References.         Bottom Line: Extremely funny! A warning though; it's British humor. While it is definetly a comedy, it's still beautifly shot and features brilliant locations.
B00006M183|5.0|Unbelieveable, this is absolutely the best album they have recorded since Ten, it might even be better than Ten. This album will go down in rock 'n' roll history as a classic.
0060082569|5.0|I recommend this honest and very straight forward book to all who care to know more about the Vietnam conflict.  As a kid who was born in the 1960's, my appreciation of the soldiers who fought and gave their lives has been limited to the various movies and stories of the era.<br />The authors of this book have done an incredible job gathering information from their fellow soldiers (and in some cases those soldiers families) in order to convey and portray what can only be described as an incredibly poignant account of their experiences.<br />I know that this will be a story I will one day recommend that my own children read in an effort to improve their understanding of the sacrafices such brave people have made for the sake of our continued freedom.
B000021XS0|5.0|Mind-altering sounds arose from my CD-player when I listened to this talented and, in its very own way, subtle piece of art.   Dream Theatre has taken instrumental and progressive rock to new, utmost heights (or depths - how could I know for sure?) of mesmerising and disturbing virtuosity.<BR>The leading song is, no doubt, 'Strange dj vu'.   However, it does not come alone, for the whole disc is a great continuum of themes which do not tend to conclude until the story itself does.<BR>Because this album tells a story.   And my advice is to learn about it in a quiet, gloomy room, having plenty of time and preparing to feel a rare set of sensations as this awesome opus comes to an end.
B00005K3LU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I had already seen it several times on TV, but it's even better on DVD!!! The picture is awesome, the sound is incredible, you just can't do any better!       Plot: New York cop, John McClane(Bruce Willis) comes to L.A. to be with his wife(Bonnie Bedelia) and kids for christmas. He stops at his wife's office where a christmas party is in progress. But there are some uninvited guests. A group of thieves posing as terrorists. The terrorist leader, Hans Gruber(Alan Rickan) terrifies the party guests and tries to get his hands on approx. 640 million dollars in bearer-bonds. But he wasn't counting on John McClane being there.       McClane escapes into the 40-story building, runs around, calls the police, and kills a bunch of terrorists while he's at it.       Rating Flags: Graphic Violence(An extremely graphic bullet-to-the-head, bullets stream through a man's legs in slow motion, McClane is forced to walk across broken glass in bear feet, many gory gunshot wounds, etc.), Very Strong Language(Tons of f words), and Brief Nudity(A couple flashes of women's breasts)       Special Features: There's an absolutely incredible/awesome special feature on disc 2. It's called Scene Editing Workshop. It's incredible! I'll let you discover it for yourself.       Overall: An awesome movie. An American masterpiece/classic!
B00004R99R|4.0|One thing that could have made this movie better, if Michael Borton singing \\"I can go the distance\\" during the end credits, was cut. Michael (in my opinion) was really bad singing that song, he sounds like a bird dying. But does Disney expect people to believe that an inmortal baby can be put on eartj, and made mortal? As the movie opens, baby Hercules is born to Zeus and his wife, and has a party, which inclues the movie's villain, Hades \\"lord of the underworld\\". Hades has Hercules stolen from Zeus and his wife, taken to earth to change to mortal and then killed. But the baby misses the last drop, and is discovered by a human couple. When Hercules is a teenager, he sets out ot find where he blongs, and a statue of his father comes to live to talk to him, and teels him to get back to being a god, he has to be trained a true hero, and his trainer is Philoctetes \\"Phil\\" (Danny DeVito). Joshua Keaton voices the young Hercules and Tate Donovan voices Hercules as an adult, Susan Egan voices Hercule's girlfriend Meg, and James Woods voices Hades.
B00006M183|5.0|If you cannot tell from my bold statement above, I am an avid PJ fan.  I was too young to catch them in the beginning, but i have been listening to them religiously for the past two years or so.  Everybody should go out and buy Ten, which is, to most, their best CD.  Riot Act, while not stacking up to Ten, is still an unfreakinbelievable album.  It's really chill and mellow with songs like Can't Keep, Love Boat Captain, I am Mine and All or None.  Pearl Jam also proves they can still wail with songs like Green Disease (which sounds strikingly similar to RVM) Get Right and Save You.  I'd have to say this is their second or third best album (competing with Vs.)  everybody should go out and buy it.  In a desert of crappy Pearl Jam ripoffs (Creed, POD, Staind, Need I say more?) Pearl Jam's fresh album serves as an oasis of good music today!<br />Keep on Rockin in the Free World!<br />J.S.K
B000066C87|1.0|This horridly boring film from Robert Altman doesn't generate enough suspense to be interesting nor humor to be funny. It wades in a cesspool of dullness, never giving us interesting characters or even comelling situations. As if the murder mystery wasn't used enough, this movie doesn't even try to give us fascinating dialogue or characters worth mentioning. The cast is divided into two parts: the rich and the servents. The rich sit around acting pompous and speaking with British accents. Their servents have no particularly unique qualities. Now here's the odd part: the film was up for the best picture award at the Oscars. What for? A weak delivery? Bland characters? This film fails on all counts in turning in something worth watching. It's long-winded and never really gets off the ground.
B000002LMM|5.0|&quot;My (musical) world is a little bit dark. . . a little bit off-center. I think of it as tragically beautiful. That is how I would describe what I love best: tragically beautiful.&quot;  Angelo Badalamenti<br />Today's working hypothesis is no composer was ever more important to the success of a television show than Angelo Badalamenti was for his work on the David Lynch televison cult hit &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990-91).<br />The criteria here is not just coming up with a memorable instrumental theme song (in which case we just pick Lalo Schifrin for &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;), but the scoring of various episodes over the course of several seasons.  By that standard what is the competition?  Jan Hammer's work on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; got a lot of publicity, but when you think of the soundtrack for that show you are just as likely to think of Glenn Frey's &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; and Phil Collins' &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; as you are the show's theme song or other incidental music.  For me the close second would be w.g. snuffy walden's work on &quot;thirtysomething,&quot; but that superb work (especially &quot;second look&quot;) never received the publicity that Badalamenti did with &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (Population 51,201).<br />Besides the memorable main theme you have the haunting &quot;Laura Palmer's Theme&quot; and the quirky little &quot;Dance of the Dream Man.&quot;  The former was used in different variations to different effects throughout the series, eloquently underscoring the twists and turns in the search for her killer.  Even when David Lynch writes some lyrics for Julee Cruise to sing, the mood produced by the music never changed.  It is amazing to me how you could always be aware of what Badalamenti was doing while watching &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; yet the music never becomes intrusive or overwhelming.  Instead it is a perfect compliment to the story and pictures.  And remember:<br />That gum you like, it's coming back in style...e...
B000050XEI|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this CD, however, her work has matured much past this point.  I've been a fan of Enya since I heard her song The Celts last year.  I'll just rate the songs in the order in which they come on the CD.<BR>A Day Without Rain: 5/5 I loved the instrumentals and can listen to it over and over without getting tired of it.<BR>Wild Child: 3/5 I find it too contemporary for my tastes, I can only listen to it once or twice before becoming sick of it.<BR>Only Time: 4/5 A great song, although hard to comprehend.<BR>Tempus Vernum: 5/5 Awesome!  The chanting sends chills down my spine.<BR>Deora Ar Mo Chroi: 5/5 A good song, showcases Enya's beautiful voice.<BR>Flora's Secret: 4/5 Has a nice beat, but the lyrics are mediocre.<BR>Fallen Embers: 5/5 Has a mournful touch to it, whcih is a nice break from the more upbeat songs on here.<BR>Silver Inches: 4/5 love the instumentals, but would have preferred something more subtanstial than only the harp and violin<BR>Pilgrim: 5/5 My favorite song on this CD.  The lyrics are wonderful, and Enya's voice is breathtaking.<BR>One by One: 2/5 Has too much of a pop influence in it for my tastes.  The lyrics don't make any sense either.<BR>Lazy Days: 2/5 The lyrics don't mean anything and, again, it has toom uch of a pop influence.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cd! I liked all the songs except for #12 (I think Christina went a little too out of her realm for this song but it's a fun song either way) Other than that, this CD is AWESOME. There is so much soul and heart in this cd. I could relate so much to her songs. She has all genres: Rock, Pop, Blues, R-n-B, Hip Hop, etc. and songs on a range of topics: falling in love, getting over a bad break up, flirting, inspiration, etc. A definite A+++++++ for Christina doing her own thing and not caring what people think.. Great cd, I'd recommend to anyone!!
0792843584|2.0|I must give 'Heaven's Gate' credit for being one of, if not the most, beautifully shot films I've ever seen. Michael Cimino is/was a very talented director, but the compliments will stop there. Its almost impossible to describe the plot because it is an absolute mess. And that's an understatement. The movie give no time for us to understand anything that is going on, and it is 3 hours and 40 minutes long!!<br />Apparently it is trying to tell the story of the Johnson County wars. How many people know what the heck that is? I know I don't know, and neither does the majority of the American public. I don't recall me learning it in history and the same can be said about most people. With that said, 'Heaven's Gate' should have told us something about the war before the movie began, but it doesn't.<br />It goes from one scene to the next without any coherancy. After watching it, I got the feeling I'd just watched a blank screen for over three hours. See it only for curiosity.
0875847706|5.0|This book gave me simple but amazing insights in areas where I was so used to being stuck, I hardly believed there could be a solution - and there was and the insights continue to come.
0553213105|5.0|You may have heard that literature is an example of the time and place during which it was written. Pride and Predjudice is such a book. While many think of it as a serious book, it is actually quite humerous. Austen's portrayal of love and marriage is a perfect example of how it should be. From marraige-obsessesed Mrs. Bennett, to the intelligent Lizzy to attractive Fitzwilliam Darcy, the book is a masterpiece! This is one book that I could (and have!) read over and over again. I challenge someone to tire of it! If you are looking for a classic, witty and all around fun book, this is it!
B00003CX5P|3.0|I have been a fan of George Lucas and Star Wars Episodes 4-6.  <br />The production quality is fantastic as expected but the story did leave me disappointed.  It looked like they were trying for special effects more than character development, so lacked much of the charm and humanity that I came to enjoy in the &quot;original&quot; episodes.<br />(I would have been happy if they cut some time out of that way-too-long pod race scene and had the characters talk to each other more.  If you check out the supplementary material, you see that there was even MORE of the pod race that had been cut out!)
0375414053|2.0|Ultimately this is the story of the poor rich successful girl (yes, I realize she wasn't born rich) that popped two kids out and didn't realize they instantly came with a nanny.  She's a control freak who can't control anything.  NOT impressed and very glad I got it from the library.
B000069I3O|5.0|I can't believe there are no reviews for this movie.  Douglas plays wealthy, emotionally distant Nicholas Van Orton.  His brother, played expertly by Sean Penn, gives him an unusual birthday present, a game.  Douglas (and the movie viewer) is unsure who is involved in this game, when it begins, the object, etc.  This movie keeps you guessing right to the climatic ending.  Very interesting movie that sticks with you.
0345448898|5.0|While Christian zealots have unfairly condemned Philip Pullman as an athesist from this series, I find that Philip Pullman have created a book of the millenium.  Not only capturing and nuturing the interest and passion of young readers and adults, he also addressed some problems that'll never be accepted in children's book, but should be discussed with children.<BR>Note ***** If you are only looking for a quick review, skip the following paragraph **********  <BR>      Take his view on christianity for example, while god has always been \\"the father of all\\", the \\"savior of mankind\\", and the church been the holy sacred temple for him, we always see Chrisitianity as 'good', 'pure'.  But how often have we seen the bad side of Chrisitianity (especially children) ? The oppression of women, the burning of witches, the tortures they used, the lid they shut on science (Galelio)....and countless more.  Children, especially those of Christian familes are drilled with the so called 'goodness' of the church, but never seemed to learn the 'not so good' side of it.  Shouldn't they be able to know the good/bad side of Christianity, to take a pick??  That's why this series is so good, it does not directly insults Christianity, but instead holds an open and philosophical view of Christianity.  <BR>     In conclusion, the series was written very very very well, with a touching and powerful ending.  For young readers, children for example, this is a good story book, one which nurtures their imagination; For young adults, this book is something to think about, to discuss the view on Adam, Eve, Garden of Eden, and Sin.<br />     By the way, I'm a 14 year old student who is writing this book, so my view of this book is a view of a YOUNG ADULT, not a mom's or dad's.
0553274503|5.0|Charlie Gordon is a retard, but an operation boosts his intelligence so that he becomes a genius. However, it becomes clear that the operation might start regressing and he may end up as retarded as when he started. The story is skilfully told in diary form, with the writing accurately reflecting the mental ability of Gordon. We watch through Gordon's eyes his mental ascent to unassailable heights; fumbling with his emotional development as it lags behind his intellect; coming to terms with his past....and brooding upon his eventual future. Although the story is sad on so many levels, the book is never depressing and always compelling. This is because Keyes is a writer of skill and subtlety, and deserves to be known to a wider audience than his narrow science fiction base. A minor 20th Century classic.
B00006M183|5.0|PJ is back (even though they never went anywhere).  Cameron seems to really fit in well on Riot Act, and the band seems to be more comfortable than they were on &quot;Binaural&quot; with exploring new horizons.  Vedder's lyrics are great as usual, and Boom's organ play adds a cool new dimension.  Fans who liked &quot;No Code&quot; will especially like this album because the songs seem to be layed out in a similar fashion.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam has gone backwards for a more mellow 70's sound. The songwriting is excellent. McReady is a stellar guitar player that shows off various solos throughout the album. There are 2 ballads and one track of just pure vocals. The rest is true rock with an older edge. This is not the Pearl Jam of old. This is a much more mature sounding band.

1563898586|5.0|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is perhaps the best comic of the 21st century. Its premise is totally original: gather already established literary characters past their primes and have them go on a mission. Moore sets himself up well, since he has unlimited characters. Since his characters are pre-created, all he has to do is fit them into the storyline. Also, he did his research. I happen to own the novels that the characters come from. I checked back to them, and all info in the comic is the same as that in the novels.<BR>One little extra that people keep failing to notice is in what would be issue two, around the beginning of the book, after they find the Invisible Man. There is a portrait on the wall with a prototype LXG. Three of the members are Natty Bumppo, Lemuel Gulliver and... The Scarlet Pimpernel, the original masked hero! Now that's a great surprise! I'd love to read about their adventures. Maybe in another volume...
B00005U2JL|5.0|I've bought VHS of Marilyn Manson: God is in the TV two years ago and it was great. 1 hour of Music clips, plus additional 1 hour live from tour. It was the coolest VHS I've ever seen.... Until now. 2 days ago, I find out in the shop long awaited DVD GGG. I came home and insert it into my DVD Rom. I only check out, if DD 5.1 is active and immediately press play button. The show, which was waiting for me, was indescribable. I have seen Marilyn Manson in Prague,Czech Republic, but this DVD offers much,much more. It includes records from Japan to Europe and (of course) scenes, I've never could see (anywhere). I love this band!! They're like no other I'm listening to or even I know. Every MM fan MUST have it and see it on his own eyes!!!!
B000002G0P|5.0|This cd is amazing. The album is a concept album, divided into three distinct musical sides. YOURS (all aggressive hard rock), MINE (moody, experimental pop/rock), &amp; THE TRUTH (progressive rock opera style, and it's in a class of it's own). All the songs are masterly crafted, polished to perfection. The guitar player Nuno is at his best, with some incredible guitar playing that just makes you think, wow how did he do that? -- The vocalist Gary Cherone sings so heartfelt and pure, he sounds incredible and has a very powerful singing voice, it's on full display here. The album has intelligent lyrics, that tackle everything from war to religious beliefs. The last side though, Everything Under The Sun, is a musical triumph that has to be considered as some of the best music ever recorded. Actually that also can be said for the whole entire album. Pick this up, words do not do this justice, hear to believe, it's an essential cd.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Don't waste your money on this, I saw the movie in the theater and it was terrible. They tried to introduce all the characters, or as many as possible, bad choice. There were scenes that appeared to have no relevance at all. (can anyone say Nobert?). Finally, for such a high budget movie, you'd think they would make some good special effects.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I first heard \\"Dirrty\\" I asked myself \\"What is this girl doing?\\", then I saw the video and I thought the world was comming to an end!!! (LOL).  I bought the album and this has got to be one of the best that I got this year.  From the first song to the last is a trip that Christina takes you showing us her true self.  \\"Dirrty\\" was just something to get our attention.  The beat of this song is very club driven and Redman is just fantastic on it, but there are many other highlights on this album that outline Christina as a true artist who is shaping her craft as she goes.  One of them is \\"Walk Away\\" is a Blues type of song that talks about a relationship where she was used.  The lyrics in this song are very heart driven and her vocals are soulfull and full of pain.  This is my favorite song on the CD.  \\"Beautiful\\" is like an anthom for everyone who has been put down by someone and letting us know that we are BEAUTIFUL!!! \\"The Voice Within\\" is a power-ballad about believing in the only person that can help you out and that is YOURSELF!!!  Throughout the CD I noticed a theme. To me it was about self-growth and accepting who you really are inside.  With this album Christina has let us know who she really is inside and out and also that she is not a child anymore.  THE GENIE HAS BEEN RELEASED!!!
B000002J09|5.0|The great thing about Led Zeppelin in the early 70's was the depth and variety of their music. While this CD has only 8 tracks, there is actually more top-notch music here than in a hundred other 75 minute discs released nowadays. For me, the guitars, mandolins ethereal voices of Sandy Denny and Robert Plant on the gorgeous &quot;Battle Of Evermore&quot; is the prettiest moment on this LP. John Bonham (R.I.P.) is so brilliant behind his drums on &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; and &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; that you can't resist playing along in the air with him! Jimmy Page's chord changes on &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; never fail to elicit tears of joy from me, even after 1,000 listens. There is not a wasted note sung or played here. A Classic.

B0000027G6|5.0|Along with Morricone's &quot;The Mission&quot;, this is the best soundtrack out there. It's better than &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, although these are fine scores.<br />Dances with Wolves has some of the most simple yet stirring melodies found in modern music. I HIGHLY recommend this CD!
B0000640S3|1.0|A very interesting movie about the true American patriot who helps to good Taliban people (also known as Al Queda people at the head with Osama Bin Laden) to fight against bad Russian barbarians. Just imagine that terrible things could happen today if Russians would defeated these peaceful Afgan people in 80's... However the history was gracious. So, bad Russianswere banished from Afghanistan, and good Taliban people were fully allowed to do that they were wanted to do. They got the money, they go the power and they got the time to prepare their plans. Should we say \\"thanks\\" to CIA and personally to Rambo for all that they did to Taliban, for all that they did to Al Queda, and for all that they did to USA??? Do you really think so?.. I didn't set any inverted commas in my review above. Hope you will be able to do this yourself, use your brain when you read my review above. Be like a human but not just like Homer Simpson. USA??? USA??? USA?..
B0000042MY|4.0|This is a good soundtrack that complemented the film. However, one reviewer said &quot;It's the best music ever written&quot; which I say, &quot;No way!&quot;<br />The variation of the theme, in my opinion, does get a bit monotonous, but the theme is beautiful and I enjoy listening to the CD.
B00006IR5S|5.0|This CD is perhaps one of the best that John Williams has ever done. The music is so moving and just a lot of good times with it.<BR>I recommend that everyone buy this CD, since it would make your life better.
B000002UA9|4.0|In order to truly appreciate the Beatle's debut, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; one has to understand that recording techniques were more primitive than 2002, using mono and 4-8 tracks.  They also did this album in about two days.  It helped that they had been playing most of these songs in their live set for some time.  All the pieces are here for what's to come from the John, Paul, Ringo and George:  nice vocal harmonies, chiming guitars and a taste of R&amp;B pop.  True, the tracks are raw, but that makes the energy all the better and more exuberant.<br />Who cares if the majority of the songs are covers, again, that was the norm of the day.  John and Paul were still budding songwriters.  Besides, all for Beatles get a lead vocal feature, which very few bands today can do.<br />&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; is one of the great rockers of all time.  Great vocals by Paul, cool bassline, twangy guitar solo by George and interesting changes.<br />&quot;Misery&quot; features some nice harmonies by John and Paul, followed by the ballad &quot;Anna&quot; and three-part harmony of John, Paul and George on &quot;Chains.&quot;<br />&quot;Boys&quot; features Ringo on lead vocals, with some nice background screaming by Paul doing his Little Richard imitation.<br />&quot;Ask me why&quot; has more nice harmonies, although the woo-woo-woo is a little dated and cheesy.  &quot;Please please me&quot; is one of the Beatles earliest singles, with some nice call/response with the &quot;come on, come on&quot; excellent harmonies and cool guitar hooks.  There's also a decent middle eight that would become a trademark for John and Paul.<br />&quot;Love Me Do&quot; is another early staple, musically simple but with more nice vocal interplay between John and Paul trading lead parts.<br />&quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; is a schmaltzy love tune, but the vocals are both earnest and naive.<br />&quot;Baby It's You&quot; is a nice cover of the David/Williams/Bacharach tune.  Check out the version on &quot;Live at the BBC.&quot;<br />&quot;Do You Want To Know a Secret&quot; is a Lennon/McCartney composition given to George.  His vocals are tentative and that Liverpool accent is pretty strong, but it's a harmless tune.<br />&quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; is well, what can I say.  Still, I like it, with the time changes and haunting melody.<br />&quot;There's a Place&quot; is probably the overlooked gem on the record, with it's urgent harmonica and super harmonies.<br />The performance of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; is now legendary, with Lennon's raw vocals and the call/response making this version outshine the original.

0449227545|5.0|I liked this book and from page one was enthralled. The obligatory romance(s) could have been left out but in case this is made into a movie they have to be there. It was exciting throughout and delved into the mind of an egotistical maniac.
B000002A46|5.0|Merry Christina is a great album, there are great songs like &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot;, &quot;Christmas(Baby Please Come Home)&quot; also some of you're favorite Christmas songs like &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, &quot;Silent Night&quot; and Santa Claus Is Comin To Town&quot;. I know this will become you're favorite christmas album.
B00006RAKP|5.0|The only thing that could have made this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; set any better would have been if it was 4 CDs (3 + bonus CD).  There are some great songs left off that force US buyers to want to get the UK version.  Maybe that was the strategy here.  Anyway essential EJ.
B000002BQK|5.0|Butterfly is one of Mariah's best albums! One of my personal favorites on the album is &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; this song is a great ballad and a heart warming song. But if you're into the up tempos then there's songs like &quot;Honey&quot; &amp; &quot;Breakdown&quot;. I could list every song on this album, because there all great songs. If you're always feeling leftout then &quot;Outside&quot; is a song you will love. I give this album 7 out of 5 Stars! It's a prefect 12!
B00006M183|5.0|I have followed Pearl Jam since their debut of Ten in 1991 and they have only gotten better and better.  Their new album Riot Act tackles the big three issues : life, death and love (with a good helping of politics on the side)  They have never disguised their political activism, but this is the first album where it is impossible to ignore with songs like \\"Bushleaguer.\\"  In another song \\"Love Boat Captain\\" they address the tragedy that took place on their 2000 tour where 9 people died in Roskilde at their concert...Eddie sings \\"We lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today.\\"  The song concludes with a positive message, \\"all you need is love, love is all you need, love, love, love.\\"  One of the best songs on the album \\"Save You\\" is the only song on the album where Eddie screams.  It is a powerful song about the power of addiction, and the struggle to save a friend in desperate need of help.  Although this is not \\"the song\\" written for Layne Staley (that may turn up on a b-side I have heard) the message is clear, from the very first line, \\"Gonna save you f***er\\" to one of the very last \\"Please help me to help you to help yourSELLLLF!\\"  <BR>One of the greatest things about this album is the group effort behind it. There are two songs written by Jeff Ament (music and words) that are absolutely amazing and like nothing you have ever heard before from this band.  Matt Cameron (former Soundgarden drummer) adds two songs to the album, one of which (\\"You Are\\") has a Nine-Inch-Nails-esque quality to it.  It is a very sexy song and like nothing you have ever heard Pearl Jam play before.  Eddie plays a solo on here with \\"Thumbing My Way\\" where he sounds very Bruce Springsteen.  There is also a 1-minute track towards the end of the album called \\"Arc\\" and any fan of Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn will smile when they hear it.  (It is clearly a tribute) Eddie experiments with his voice on this track in a way that he has never before on any album.  <BR>Another key to what makesthis album so stunning and fresh is the fact that they have, after all these years, finally added a keyboardist!  \\"Boom\\" a friend of Eddie's from Hawaii has lent his help to the album and really transformed their sound.  He will also be playing on the tour with them this upcoming year and re-working older songs like \\"Black\\" and \\"Betterman\\" giving them a fresh new taste with the keyboard.  <BR>If you love Pearl Jam this album is a MUST HAVE.  If you gave up on Pearl Jam after their second or third album, this is the one where you owe it to yourself to pick this album up and give it a listen.  YOU WILL BE AMAZED!
0887307280|5.0|What a great little book. I highly recommend this to ANY person owning their own small business. Some people may say that Gerber's &quot;franchise&quot; or &quot;systematic&quot; philosophy of business ownership doesn't apply to all, but I completely disagree. There is something for EVERYONE in this book. <br />Buy it. More importantly, USE it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|There's a reason that \\"Spider-Man\\" broke all kinds of box office records in the United States on its way to grossing just over $800 million dollards world wide.<br />For starters, Spider-Man is one of the most popular comic book super heroes of all time. Almost everyone can somehow relate to the struggles that Peter Parker faces. Most of us can associate with feeling like you are living a dual-life. And besides, just how cool would it be to be able to crawl up walls and shoot webs from our hands.<br />Another reason is that \\"Spider-Man\\" almost faithfully adapts the story of our hero from the small pages to the big screen. There are minor changes, but nothing that alters what the story is about or who the characters are.<br />Yet another reason is because of the terrific action in the movie. The CGI and special effects in the action sequences were nothing short of amazing.<br />And still another reason is the romance in the movie. It made it easier for the guys to ask their girls to go watch the movie with them.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of all time. Despite initial concerns, Tobey Maguire is very convincing as our conflicted hero. Kirstin Dunst, as always, was excellent, and casting William DaFoe as the Green Goblin was nothing short of brilliant.<br />This DVD edition comes packed with hours of extra, much of which most people won't care about. However, the \\"making of\\" and \\"E! Entertainment\\" specials are worth watching. And for the fans of the comic books, there is an entire section of the 2nd DVD devoted to the history of the Spider-Man comics, including the loves of Peter Parker.
B00005221L|5.0|Arnold hit his peak with the release of &quot;Predator&quot;. The movie that almost never was remains til today as action as action can get. The flick pulls no punches or cater toward a ladies needs. You will find no inner love story here! I guess we can call this our &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;.<br />A great cast of some known and not so known actors. Billy, the Indian especially is a strong character. Jesse Ventura has a few classic quotes he won't get away with today. Carl Weathers is strong in a non-Apollo Creed role. And of course there is Arnold. As tough as he is...he is just another puny human compared to the alien. A great buy, highest recommedation!
B000069AUI|4.0|The album is certaintly not as great as the first release by coldplay. That said, Coldplay are artists that deserve their share of attention in your player. Spies is certaintly a very intriguing song and to follow such brilliance would be very hard, but they manage quite well to innovate without formulating themselves. Although the terrain they travel is unfamiliar and somewhat hard to digest like on the opening track, this album has very successful moments that really make it worth it. Recommended!
0783226845|5.0|This movie shows what our kids are learning in school nowadays, unlike our ancestors. They have become totally like minnows and wouldnt be able to take care of themselves when they are a encountered by trying situations. The man, Colonel Slade, shows what a real &quot;man&quot; would be like. Its a great movie and you will have ur spirits up if u are a man and (like me) have been forced by society to suppress your manhood.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream theater is one of those bands that can bring you to your knees with their metal, and have you standing with determination by the day's end.  This double disk set is indeed a work of art.  Leaving no note unheard, the Dream Theater team dishes out song after song of raw emotion.  Track number four on the first cd brings the stem cell research debate into light through dream like melodies.  This is a must have for any serious metal head.
B00005RG6B|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST LIVE VIDEOS EVER! IF YOU LIKED THE STUDIO ALBUM YOU WILL REALLY APPRECIATE THE TALENT OF THIS BAND LIVE. TO SOUND THIS GOOD LIVE IS A TRUE TESTAMENT TO THIER ABILITY AS MUSICIANS. A GUARANTEED WINNER!
B000000OUW|4.0|This record needs to be heard blasting through your cracked car windows as you speed past a church on Sunday.  Manowar can get the job done.  With such metal diversity from Courage to Return of the warlord, it's no doubt that the kings of metal shall not stray from the path of true rock.  Listen to this one loud, hard, and fast. And you'll know true metal exists today.
B00005OAIE|5.0|If this were vinyl, I would have worn it out already.  John's only 25, and yet he's captivating audiences from the age of 15 to 83.  He's only bound to mature his ability, but for a debut album, this ROCKS!  He most certainly has an old soul as I remember boys at that age and most were never that deep or soul searching (not that I am THAT much older).  He has managed to capture the essence of what makes music popular...relating to others thoughts, desires and histories and making it sound catchy and then adding a strong blues edge and influence.  I can't even say that he is a spokesperson for his generation because when I saw him live, I was amazed at the diversity of his audience.  I had listened to him before he hit the mainstream and wish that those of us who enjoyed him then would have been able to keep him secret from the rest of you, but since the secret's out, buy this CD and you won't take it out of the CD player...
0440211727|4.0|I'm writing this review to voice a basic disagreement I have with what I believe is popular opinion.  This is not Grisham's best work.<br />Grisham had me wrapped around his Mississippi finger for the last 100 pages of the book, but up until then it was only interesting enough to read.  This may be the result of having criminal justice entertainment crammed down our thoughts with 20 different Law and Order shows, plus however many other trials (fictional and not) that grace our T.V. and movie screens.  I'm sure when it came out, this book blew people away, but by now the story has become stale.  If you haven't read his books before, I recommend The Firm as your first.  It trancends courtroom drama in a way that A Time to Kill just can't.
B0000714B5|5.0|1. The plot.  The Nobel prize winner, Hermann Hesse, wrote Siddhartha in 1922. It is a novel about Eastern spirituality (many Indian scholars consider it as one of the few succesful examples of Indian philosophy presented by a Western author). Siddhartha is one of the names given to the Buddha himself.  The novel narrates the pilgrimage of the son of a Brahmin, his struggle to find his own destiny; his friendship with Govinda (his \\"shadow\\"); his encounters with many different people: the Samanas (the ascetics that practice self-denial); Kamala (a courtesan who claims that she can teach and provide love as an art); Kamasawami (a rich merchant who becomes his boss); and Vasudeva... - note Vasudeva is another name given to Krishna, the teacher/driver of Arjuna in the Bhagavad-Gita).<br />2. The Movie.  In 1972, Conrad Rooks (an almost unknown movie director who made \\"Chappaqua\\" in 1966) came out with a 94-minute movie transcription of Hesse's novel.  He engaged Sven Nykvist (the famous Swedish cinematographer of Igmar Bergman) and a mainly Indian cast, including Shashi Kapoor (Siddhartha), Simi Garewal (Kamala),  Romesh Sharma (Govinda) and Zul Vellani (Vasudeva). The beautiful music was composed by Hemanta Mukherjee (I hope the soundtrack will be available soon). It will be particularly enjoyable by those who had read the book. In many of the scenes the synergism produced by the photography, the music and the acting is superb. And with few excceptions, the movie is a good transcription of the book.  The book and the movie became part of the \\"cult culture\\" of the West coast of the early seventies, but it never got the attention of the general public. With a condescending tone, Leonard Maltin refers to the movie as \\"too arty, but on-location photography ... is often dazzling\\".
0028643151|5.0|This is an excellent book. Well written and about a topic that will definitely keep you turning the pages. Each chapter is about a separate &quot;catastrophe&quot; and begins with a quick 2-3 page hypothetical situation. The chapter then goes into explaining the cold, hard facts and research behind the scenario in depth. From Cyberattacks to Ebola to Nuclear exchanges, it's in here.<br />I'll be honest with you as well... Unless you have a gut-of-steel, this information will make you uneasy, and will most likely frightening you. And, what makes it so scary is how it's simply based on real research and rock-solid facts. You read these scenarios, and you think, &quot;Wow... That could actually happen.&quot;<br />Otherwise, enjoy the book for what it is: Information. Because, after all, you can never have too much knowledge.
B00006M183|2.0|I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan, and was looking forward to this release. Unfortunately, it was a wait that was unfulfilling. Pearl Jam reminds us of their glory days on a few of the tracks (i.e I am Mine and Love Boat Captain). The majority, however, are overly moody and pensive (even for Eddie Vedder) and seem to disolve into no particular place. The album probably should have been called \\"Side B\\" or \\"Look what I found in the bottom of this old guitar case\\". One gets the feeling that the boys got together after being hassled by their record company to fulfill their contract, and spit out whatever permeated their beer soaked brains. This is obviously not their best work, and sadly may be their worst. I certainly hope it's not their last, because there is better music that can come from these talented musicians. It will be worth the wait if they choose to make it. This, however, is not it.
B000008GEF|4.0|This album was bought for me when I was 10 years old on vinyl and it's always been one of my favorites.  It doesn't have a lot of the &quot;wall of sound&quot; schlock that the Phil Spector produced All Things Must Pass contains and it seems more authentically George.  Another observation is that while the never ending court travails influenced one or two tracks on this album, George wasn't yet overwhelmed by the My Sweet Lord case which seemed to dominate some of his later music.  All in all one of my favorite post-Beatle albums by any of the Fab Four.
B0000248L0|5.0|This gem had only one trouble: it came in 1990, when trahs was already losing its force, and when its pioneers like Metallica and Slayer had already ripped the benefits.<BR>Also, the uncapacity of Jeff Waters to keep its singers made the band lack a solid indentity with its public.<br />But \\"NEVER NEVERLAND\\" is marvellous, the bes trash than can be created!
B00005JKG7|4.0|Fog is an underrated and atmospheric gem. It is essential to see it in widescreen because John Carpenter keeps all sorts of good creepy things in the corners and Dean Cundy's photography is beautiful. Like \\"The BIRDS\\" the film has a nice slow build. Be patient and pay attention to all the accumilating clues of an impending supernatural event as a small town is surrounded by the spectral FOG. It has an old fashioned ghost story feel as well as shocks (most of which are supplied by truly frightening sound effects). UNFORTUNATELY the DVD is a big disappointment! GET THE SPECIAL EDITION WIDESCREEN LASERDISC on EBAY if you can. Fans of John Carpenters music should be aware the laserdisc has the music score isolated on a seperate audio track and the new DVD does NOT give us this feature. Its very important for Carpenter fans because the recently released expanded CD is really a release of the poorly done LP with new tracks made up of re-edits of the existing tracks. So much music from the film is STILL missing on the CD and the laserdisc is the only way to get it. ALSO the DVD has some outtakes as seen on the laser disc but NOT all of them. Missing on the DVD outtakes is different FX clips of the fog damaging a generator, the live FOG FX being spread thru the town, a unused moment of a rotting hand coming out of the misty water, and extra FX clips of the FOG composited on the bay. These are included on the laser though. There is an annoying visual glitch during a suspenseful moment as the FOG engulfs a house. The film freezes for a second and it really stands out like a sore thumb. This glitch is NOT on the widescreen laserdisc. While the DVD does correct a small audio glitch that the laserdisc had, they instead give us a even more noticable visual mistake. The DVD picture is slightly washed out taking the richness out of the color a bit. The FOG should have a bluish tinge to it and this transfer has it washed out to white and sometimes a very slight yellow green. Just like the DVD cover art showing the green mist which is wrong!!.
B00000255X|1.0|Such great reviews for this lousy album. It seems Dylan can do no wrong. He can! BLOOD ONT HE TRACKS is much better than this one here. The only worth track is \\"HUrricane\\". The rest is...
B00006M183|5.0|Many other bands may sell more albums, but they don't really matter, do they? If you are void of substance in your musical catalog, you may want to try this album. You may not dig all the songs on the first listen, but the songs grow on you and provide satisfaction... This album has its fair share of rockers and ballads. \\"Save You\\" is in the mold of \\"Do the Evolution\\" \\"Spin The Black Circle.\\" What I really look forward to is seeing these tunes performed in concert. Peace
B000007O9L|4.0|If you're looking for the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of a live show, look elsewhere. But if your looking for some great Rolling Stones tunes that you don't often get to hear, this is a great choice. With the feel of an Unplugged show, although much of it is indeed plugged, the Stones dig out some of their more country/blues material that's perfectly suited to the setting. Although they kick things off with the rocking &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, the general mood is considerably more laidback. The inclusion of little-known gems such as the gospelly &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, the slithery blues of &quot;The Spider &amp; the Fly&quot;, the bopping 60's soul feel of &quot;I'm Free&quot;, the country twang of &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;, &amp; the jaunty old-time blues of &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; were strokes of genius. They're naturals at Dylan's &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; (dare I say this is the definitive version??). &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; fits in nicely with the rest of the set. &quot;Wild Horses&quot; &amp; &quot;Angie&quot; were obvious choices. The only serious drawback for me was the agonizing &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, (although I suppose it's worth it if the only way to keep Keith in the band is to let him sing an occasional lead!). <BR>If you're looking for another side of the Stones &amp; you're tired of the umpteenth live version of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, etc., you'll love this CD.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Little attention was paid to Elton John when he first appeared on the scene. It took a solid two years after he broke in the US for his native UK to notice him. Maybe he needed a better fashion sense to gain the attention. Anyway, this is a fine comprehensive collection of John's string of hit singles. What's amazing is how little craftsmanship and art there is in hit singles now. John in collaboration (for the most part) with long time lyricist Bernie Taupin concentrated on craftsmanship. Sure he borrowed from The Beatles, The Stones and others but he managed to craft their unique elements into his own unique sound. His most fertile period was 1970 through 1975 (by the time of Blue Moves his muse had abandoned him).<br />His work in the late 70's with Gary Osborne lacked the melodic sense and insightful (if slightly convulted and occasionally overdramatic) lyrics of Taupin. Both did far from their best work when working with others. By 21 at 33 John resumed his collaboration with Taupin (as well as still working with Osborne and others).<br /> ... His work in the 80's wasn't quite up to par to his best work. There were still many highlights and Too Low For Zero along with some of the albums after that were pretty strong. This great collection isn't definitive--it lacks a number of key album tracks and focuses on the singles (rightly so) but includes many lesser singles.<br />It's nice that Gus Dudgeon's involved and importance to Elton's early albums are finally acknowledged. He was George Martin to Elton's Beatles (or Jimmy Miller to his Stones). His best work was with Dudgeon (and his best later work was with the talented Chris Thomas as producer).<br />The rarities included here (like The Who's Ultimate Collection) aren't really rare but they're nice additions.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Don't waste your money on this, I saw the movie in the theater and it was terrible. They tried to introduce all the characters, or as many as possible, bad choice. There were scenes that appeared to have no relevance at all. (can anyone say Nobert?). Finally, for such a high budget movie, you'd think they would make some good special effects.
B00006FXB6|4.0|Imagine Black Sabbath had formed during the comedown from the grunge movement in Seattle.  There's the most suscinct description of this band's sound.  And this is a good thing.
B000002G7E|5.0|&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; is one of the most accessible albums I've heard in a while.  And it's not a total mess of guitars.  Sure it's noisy, but there is more of a fuzziness to it than a hairiness.  The reviews that said this album is bad, were lying.  The reviews that said this was the best of the VU weren't.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDTRACK IV EVER HEARD. IT SETS A CERTAIN ATMOSPHERE & ALL THE TRACKS FIT 2GETHER WELL (APART FROM 1 - SEE FURTHER ON!!).THE 3 EM TRACKS ARE SPOT ON & ALL GET 10/10.

B00005JL3A|2.0|This movie was totally dumb.  The only thing I give it credit for is the fact that it made me jump.  Wow....big deal.  The zombies were so phony and the ending.....well, I wont give it away but it definently dissapointed me more than the movie itself and that was pretty hard to beat.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|This is not a great album. As a lifelong, devoted listener to the words and music of Johnny Cash, and very aware of the personal circumstances in his life, I would much prefer to have written something a bit more triumphant. But that would just be dishonest.<br />So much filler. Well-intentioned stuff that just didn't work for whatever reason - maybe the wrong song for Cash's style, the wrong arrangement, or something more elusive. \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"Danny Boy\\", \\"Desperado\\" - none of this resonates and touches the heart the way so much of the material on the previous three \\"American\\" albums does.<br />And what makes it all the more noticeable is the title cut, \\"The Man Comes Around\\". In stark contrast, this song is a monster, one of the very best (and immediately a candidate for THE best) songs Johnny Cash has ever recorded. We all think about life and death, but rarely is this abstraction so brilliantly expressed in song. \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is frightening and reassuring all at once. The book of Revelations swings open, the words and images jump from the pages and swirl around as if it were a scene from some \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" movie, and the spirit is transported. One cannot listen to this piece and not be moved and changed. <br />And it is so much a Johnny Cash song. The lyric goes \\"WHEN the man comes around\\", but by dropping the \\"When\\" in titling it, Cash teases us with the double meaning. I can see him laughing to himself when he thought of it. Here is this man, practically loitering at the doorway to the next dimension, delivering with the all power and cockiness of a young king rooster. He's not saying \\"Don't write me off\\" - that is defeat in disguise. It's \\"Be careful treading in my yard, son. Looks are deceiving\\". Because they are.<br />Now, that's a tough act to follow. And for a while at least, the album hangs in there. \\"Hurt\\" is very good - moody and melodic, soft and strong. \\"Give My Love to Rose\\" is strong as well, but it's a reworking of a song done before, and turns out to be a signpost for a loss of momentum. \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is acceptable, but nothing more. One more step up for Sting's \\"Hung My Head\\", but then that's it, really. The atmosphere of foreboding and brilliance established early on is lost, and things get kind of pedestrian thereafter.<br />What this really should have been is an EP. Take the first five tracks, drop \\"Bridge\\", maybe add \\"Sam Hall\\" as a finisher, and you'd have something tight, strong, and honest.  Because, no matter how it was packaged and sold, the essential piece was \\"The Man Comes Around\\". There was no need to dress things up any further.<br />Now, that creaky old SOB is showing us that not only can he do this stuff, he IS this stuff. No time to sit and around and get cozy, John. Put another great one together, because you can, and that's what you do. We'll be waiting for you. Outside the yard, just to be on the safe side.
1573226521|5.0|Skipping the synopsis, I'll just tell you why I liked the book so much.  It seems that in the book world today we are caught up with Tom Clancy's terrorists and Anne Rice's vampires, and we have forgotten what real literature is.  Literary devices like symbolism and dramatic irony may have been lost in place of guns and blood, but these are found in plenty in Garland's masterpeice The Beach.<br />     This book can be read by the casual reader who likes tropical settings and an exciting storyline(both of which Garland utilizes expertly), or the hardcore lit buff who wants to read it and re-read it looking for subtleties and messages.  I have personally read it three times so far and I'm pleasantly suprised with a new meaning each time.  Garland will not vanish from the world of books, he will be very famous one day.
0316096199|5.0|I'm giving this book five stars as it really is a fantastic book.  The best non fiction always reads like fiction and Lucky does that and does it well.  Alice's description of the rape and aftermath are so well done you feel as though you were there in Syracuse at the time.  However, the book does have a MAJOR fault.  The ending.  I couldn't believe when I got to the ending and there was a short chapter on her heroin use following college with no real warning this was coming.  You are reading along and in the entire book I don't think any substance beyond alcohol is mentioned (as least as far as Alice's intake is concerned).  Suddenly, there in the last chapter she's discussing smoking heroin and living the life of a vagabond.  She just doesn't segue into this very well.  There's no real description of how she began, how she stopped, etc.  I felt like I was reading a different book by a different author.  Considering how much of her family she exposed, her mother's \\"flaps\\" (anxiety attacks-the poor woman was clearly under-medicated or improperly medicated), her parent's indifferent style of loving not only each other but their children; she seems to clam up about this side of herself.   It seems impossible to think that she's intentionally clamming up after vividly and explicitly describing everything else that's happened to her.  It's as though she doesn't think her substance abuse problem was connected to the fallout from the rape.  This being stated,  Alice Seebold is one author that I eagerly anticipate reading any and everything she writes.
6305291500|3.0|Allen Bauer (Tom Hanks) is a fairly successful produce merchant who loses his girlfriend prior his friends wedding and in grief he withdraws to Cape Cod.  When he arrives to Cape Cod he falls into the ocean in a similar accident that he experienced 20 years ago as a child.  In the accident he losses his wallet as he is saved by a Mermaid, which he is completely unaware of.  A couple of days later Allen gets a phone call from the police regarding a young woman who has been found wandering around naked outside the Statue of Liberty with his wallet.  Splash is an entertaining film that unfortunately has some melodramatic moments that lowers the cinematic experience.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Two observations:<br />1) The people who dislike this movie because of the violence are the targets of the satire. Naturally, they give it bad reviews, because it makes fun of them.<br />2) It has been argued that this movie causes people to think violence is glorified and cool, but isn't that the point that the movie is trying to make about the media? This movie may have unintended consequences on children viewers, but it was made for adults and given an R rating, so kids shouldn't be watching it anyway. I can't find any argument as to why the movie is bad, except for the violence issue, and I think that a well informed and intelligent viewer can see the satire as it is.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I was blown away when I listened to Deliverance. The sheer power of it is beyond description. I felt that every song was even better than the one before it, if thats at all possible. <br />To all Opeth fans: YES! Its true that Deliverance is the heaviest Opeth to date. However, that doesnt mean that the usual soft spots aren't present. For Absent freinds is a soft, beautiful instrumental. Not as good as Harvest on Blackwater Park, but if thats what Damnation (the upcoming softer Opeth album) sounds like, it will be another masterpiece. <br />For people new to Opeth, they are a band that mixes Death Metal with Prog influences. As opposed to many Death bands, Akerfeldt (the singer) is not ashamed to use clean vocals as well as death growls, i.e he doesnt growl for the sake of it, only when necessary as befits the lyrics and music. The music is melodic and, at times, haunting.  The lyrics are some o the best I've heard in metal.<br />All in all, this is one album I'd recommend to all ineterested in Prog And Melodic Death Metal. 5 Stars.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|This edition of Pearl Harbor is a must-have for all fans... First of all, the presentation of the box set is incredible. It was magnificent created, it includes a &quot;copy&quot; of the famous Roosevelt's speech to the Nation... It also contains several post cards with pics of the main characters, a booklet with more pictures and the episodes, and in the center of the box set, 4 envelopes, containing the 4 DVD's. Of course, if you didn't like the movie, don't bother buying this edition, you wouldn't appreciate it as much as the rest of us, who loved the movie.
B000002UAX|5.0|I am 14 years old,and I bought this album last summer, just two months after buying Revolver, the greatest album of all time.  Nothing can stand up to Revolver, but if anything almost does, it's the White Album.  This is funny, because the Bealtes didn't even try very hard.  John was stoned out of his mind and starting his relationship with Yoko, Ringo quit for a few days, Paul did several songs by himself(like Blackbird, Why Don't We Do It in the Road, Mother Nature's Son...there's more), and George was mad at everyone for not taking their meditation they studied in India seriously.  They were not in the mood to make an album, but they made a double album, and a good one, too.  Some people try to judge the Beatles becasue of their decision to make a double album.  HOW FOOLISH!  More music, more Beatles!  And everything the Beatles ever did was fantastic, so don't complain, man!  Also, the Beatles truly show their talent on this album with all the different styles of music they perform.  Heavy rock, jazz, reggae, there's tons of them!  And not one song is bad!  Revoltion 9 is NOT A SONG!  So it doesn't count.  Actually, Good Night is a poor choice to end such a wonderful album.  I would have picked Glass Onion, but that's me.  Really, there are few faults that can be found on this album.  The high points of the album are I'm So Tired, Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, Birthday, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter, Honey Pie, Cry Baby Cry, and - oh, I can't name all of them!  Revolver is flawless; the White ALbum is nearly as good. Wanna know what else is good?  Rubber Soul.  And Abbey Road.  And Sgt. Pepper is okay, too.  BUY THEM ALL!    YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B00006M183|5.0|What can I say.  I am not going to ramble on and on about how great Riot Act is.  If you are a Pearl Jam fan, you surely have come to expect nothing less.  Riot Act continues on Pearl Jam's experimental path, trading hooks for odd time signatures and inventive chord changes.  Stone and Mike sound awesome and Matt continues to prove he belongs with these guys.  For those of you looking for yet another TEN, go buy yourself another copy of that or it's many modern rock clones.  If you like solid rock and roll, from five guys who continue to push the envelope on their seventh studio album, then by all means pick up Riot Act now.  Music is great, Ed's lyrics touch on many subjects and are better than ever.  If you are a true PJ fan like myself, you will not be let down.
6305648522|5.0|reddifnes the term \\"tear-jerker\\" I defy anyone not to shed a tear at the end sequence of this movie.  I will not go into plot as others have already done that.  Let me say once and for all, no matter kind of mives you like, no matter if you don't like foreign films, see this movie.
B00005RFAI|5.0|this is a good cd but you should buy oven mits they rock<BR>you wish you had oven mits dont you yeah...........
B0000028PL|4.0|this album should be a classic.  It embodies the true mission of rock music - angry, rebellious, brilliantly played.  It's a great antidote to the whiny, mushy pablum that is all over the radio today. Buy it and get in touch with your masculine side.
B00005A0RI|3.0|I don't suppose there's really anything wrong with this album. The songs are really quite lovely. They are also, however, (in my opinion) mostly pretty boring. I hoped for more from an album with such an alluring title and premise (Haden's jazz with a Cuban influence), but was disappointed. For me, it lacked both diversity and spice-two things I excitedly hoped to find.<br />The only track that really seems to have much individual character is track 8, &quot;El Ciego (The Blind).&quot;  All the other tracks blend practically seamlessly together, sounding FAR too much like everything else I've ever heard of Haden's, albeit with somewhat of a Cuban influence which, at times, I didn't even particularly notice. Still, they were beautiful, regardless of their similarities.<br />Another problem I had was with the general mood of the music on the album. The title (Nocturne) and the notion of a Cuban influence was appealing to me because they somehow indicate a sort of provocative sensuality. Overall, however, I found the music generally wistful and somewhat melancholy. It was just a bit too slow, being more the music of someone drinking alone in a quiet bar than the music of a busy, exciting nightlife (Cuban or otherwise). It really even lacks the potential of the latter. Only a couple of tracks managed to supply any notion of excitement, the two most notable being &quot;Tres Palabras (Three Words)&quot; and (again) &quot;El Ciego (The Blind).&quot;<br />In short, I really enjoy Haden's work, but had hoped for a little more of something different in this album that I didn't see. It's a lovely collection of slow, wistful recordings, but if you're looking for anything electrifying, you might look somewhere else.
B00006SFBD|4.0|First off, I discovered Opeth by hearing Blackwater Park. I now own all their CDs. I know to expect a mixture of acoustic passages, clean vocals, Cookie Monster Deth Vox, and double-bass augmented power riffs galore. This album is little different with a few more glaring weak points, and therein lies my only reason for giving this CD 4 stars.<br />This CD is intended to be the first of a two disc set: the companion, titled \\"Damnation\\", is to be released next spring. Interviews with the primary songwriter, Michael Akerfeldt, would lead you to believe that this is the heavier. disc of the two. By God, is it ever heavy!  Six tracks, five over 10:00 long.<br />The first two tracks, \\"Wreath\\" and the title track, are brutal in its delivery of pounding double bass and good ol' Opethian riffage. There are a few respites in the action, but for the most part both are an assault on the senses. The last 4 minutes of the title track, however, are the same two riffs repeated over and over and over again. I think it ended up just adding time to the song and not adding to the mood like Blackwater Park's \\"Drapery Falls\\" did.<br />If you ever consider buying this album, do it for \\"A Fair Judgement\\". Although the lyrics themselves are short, base, and relatively unimaginative, the bluesy influences and guitar solo halfway through make this song great. In fact, because (or in spite of) this song is missing the Cookie Monster Deth Vox, this song makes the album Opeth. <br />The next track, \\"Absent Friends\\", is the necessary soft instrumental. Nothing really there to spark the imagination, in my opinion, but it recharges your batteries for two more barrages of Opeth metal, which \\"Master's Apprentices\\" and \\"By The Pain I See In Others\\" serve well enough. The album closes with a few bars of keyboard noodling (likely by Mr. Wilson from the band Porcupine Tree) and FX-laden 'backwards singing' of a few lines from \\"Master's Apprentices\\". The vocals themselves kinda weirded me out. Probably something to listen to at night with nothing on but a black light.<br />Why did I give this album 4 stars, even though I love Opeth to death? Because I feel that my expectations weren't quite met given previous material. Because I think this is the first real \\"formula\\" Opeth album. Because I am sure they are capable of more than one standout track on an album. Because I can immediately recommend almost every other album to listen to from this band INSTEAD of this one.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad disc at all. I would just recommend going elsewhere first if you aren't familiar with Opeth yet, preferably Blackwater Park or My Arms, Your Hearse first. For Opeth fans: this is more of the same but still recommended to add to your collection.
0312243022|5.0|THE HOURS begins with the gifted author, poet and visionary Virginia Woolf drowning herself rather than facing another period of madness. The subsequent text entwines three narrative paths: Virginia Woolf as she writes MRS DALLOWAY during the 1920s; California housewife Mrs. Laura Brown whose favorite book is MRS DALLOWAY during the 1940s; and book editor Mrs. Clarissa Vaughan, nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" in the 1950s. Three women, three different timeframes, all bound together in a shimmering conclusion that is destined to haunt the reader long after the last page is turned. <br />Clarissa Vaughan plans a party for her friend Richard, who has just won a major literary award for his poetry. Housewife Laura Brown struggles to find more meaning to her life than a simple existence than just as a wife and as a mother. The text brilliantly exposes their psyches, capturing the subtle nuances and flavors with a graceful pen; thereby exploring the contradictions and compromises that create our existence; deftly detailing fluidity of time and existence. <br />While mass-market readers may be a bit baffled by THE HOURS, literary scholars and classics lovers will adore it. Readers who bring a through knowledge of Virginia Woolf, a love of her novel MRS DALLOWAY, and an appreciation of the poetry of language will discover an amazing gift of beauty within this finely woven novel. Indeed, Virginia Woolf scholars will recognize the influence of ORLANDO, THE WAVES and A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN, as well as MRS DALLOWAY. In addition, admirers of the beauty of language will be stunned by Cunningham's ability to capture Woolf's voice and style in her sections, to flavor it with his own voice in the Clarissa Dalloway's sections, and then to exhibit his own unique voice and style in the Laura Brown's sections. A memorable novel to treasure, THE HOURS earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the best examples of an eclectic musical mixture. It includes sounds from several different milestones on the history of pop and rock of the last 30 years. When I hear these songs I hear Pearl Jam, I hear Catatonia, I hear Dido, I hear Jeff Buckley. This guys made it possible to insert all that in a single CD. This alone makes it worth getting it.
0312265859|3.0|I'd really give this three and a half stars, because I did enjoy this book.  The darker edge was different and interesting, although I was a bit disappointed in the lack of Morelli in this one.  Ranger is tasty, but he doesn't really have the depth that Morelli does, and Stephanie is a bit too confused between the two for my taste.  Sure, Ranger's sexy... but I thought she loved Morelli?  And Morelli's no slouch on sexiness, either.<br />What really made me give this novel the lower rating was the ending.  I won't tell you what it is, but it's not the usual Plum pluck that got Stephanie out of her trouble.  It was a bit too \\"deus ex machina\\" for me, like Janet just needed to end the book for a publishing date, so she stopped the story and rescued Stephanie from her troubles.  I preferred Stephanie using her own luck and resourcefulness to get herself out of scrapes, instead of the damsel in distress routine.  She's certainly needed rescue before, but managed to save herself, instead of waiting for the men to save her!<br />All in all, I very much liked this bookm but it could have been better.  It made me go back and reread One for the Money, still my ultimate favorite in this series.  It was the first book that actually made me laugh out loud while reading, and I'll continue to read this series, no matter what, because of that.  Kudos Janet, but just make sure that Stephanie doesn't become wishy-washy!
B000065U1N|3.0|I must have watched this film at least 25 or 30 times ,and came away each time shaking my head in askance as to why we  were there in the first place. The exploits of Task Force Ranger were detailed very well in the book ; the film , although very \\"heroic\\" really didn't own up to the fact that the whole operation was screwed up. Over 60% of the Rangers and Delta Force boys were either killed or wounded. That critical diatribe aside , I thought that the portrayal of the young Americans who fought the battle of Mogodishu was very good. Tom Sizemore always brings his character to life--this time LTC Danny McKnight. In fact Colonel McKnight was perhaps the most realistic senior officer involved in the battle ; he realized what a terrible risk was being taken by the senior brass to capture the warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. <br />The combat scenes that follow the landing of the Ranger chalks are pretty realistic ; the axiom that \\"no plan survives contact with the enemy\\" , the one the brass forgot , plays out before the viewer's eyes. Those who have never served in the military cannot understand that full auto fire can really do a number on the hearing as portrayed in the movie. This film shows the enormously destructive power of modern helicopters as well as their vulnerability to small arms ground fire...<br />I guess I didn't really \\"enjoy\\" this film ; I found myself time-warped back 35 years to my time in the army , and found myself cursing the politicians who got us into this situation and the generals who did the planning(?!) for the operation.<br />As a general comment on the film , it really is a must see. However the book is a must read if you watch the film. I rated the film only 3 stars because it didn't reveal to the audience the real magnitude of the tragedy to both sides. It is , however , a suitable tribute to the soldiers who served.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbusters has always been one of my favorite movies.  As a kid, I watched it for the ghosts (especially Slimer, but then, he's every kid's favorite).  I didn't get the sexual references back then of course, but I still knew a funny movie when I saw one.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for every kid -- know your child.  If they're afraid of, say, the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz, the ghost in the library scene will probably scare them, as well as some of the other scenes.  This is a funny, funny movie, but if you don't think your children can handle some of the scary scenes, wait until they're older.<br />The DVD edition is much better than the old VHS I had, which was actually taped off of cable and not the highest quality.  The sound and picture has been cleaned up and is now of high quality (although alot of the special effects are still incredibly cheesy) and the director commentary and deleted scenes are great.  I always love hearing the memories of the directors and writers when DVDs are released with this -- it makes things much more personal, and some of the stories make you laugh almost as much as the movie itself.<br />In summary, this is probably one of the best, if not the best, movie to come out of the 80's.  A classic, which everyone should watch at some point.  I'd rate this 10 stars if I could.  \\"Let's run some red lights!\\"
0380018179|5.0|I read this book years ago, I must have been in the 8th grade then, but I was used to reading big books, and I just loved it.  fell in love with Father Ralph and I just love the name Dane. I have never forgotten that name. After Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy, which I really recommend if you liked this book, this has got to be one of my all-time favorites. I've kept my copy preserved and on the shelf in a place of honor and I tell you, it really deserves it.
B00005QHSN|5.0|I first listened to this album roughly about a year and seven months ago in its origninal incarnation with the free download.  It is november of 2002 and I still pull so much from this album after so many turns on my cd player.  The energy in this masterpiece is beyond the physical.  If you allow it, it can effect your soul and emotions.  Creativity pours from Sanada's soul and magically pours into the depth of your heart.  I have purchased dozens of records over the years, yet nothing has had the lasting effect that Wild Card AKA Solar return has.  Sananda should continue, if he is capable,(recording contract issues) of creating this music of freedom. Soul on a disc for real.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This album runs the risk of being classified a Schedule 1 drug by the FDA for its remarkable addictive potential. Yes, Diana Krall is like aural heroin on this electrifying CD. Her pacing, her rich, sultry voice and her impeccable pianistic skills shine like very few artists around today. I have played piano for nearly 50 years (God, am I THAT old?) and find that  I simply  MUST play along with this album every time I listen to it. This is also one of the best recorded live albums I have ever heard from an audiophile perspective. My system seduces me into believing that she is literally playing in my living room along with her great  backup musicians. I saw her live at the Algonquin Hotel in New York  about 5 years ago and the verve, swing and intimacy that  I heard at that concert are clearly in evidence here on this cd. It looks like this brief review will be one of many 5 star ones for this album. It  is certain to be a classic. Buy one, but if you don't have any money, this album is so good...
0451450523|5.0|This book is shimmering with magic and beauty. It is just as otherwordly as the fairy-tales you loved as a child, and yet it somehow more than that. It has its own mood, its own atmosphere. Somehow, it seems as though all the characters are aware of the world they live in, as real people never are. This is not a dream pretending to be real. This reality well aware that it is a dream.<br />The charakters are simple and yet each serves a purpose. Each is distinct and well-drawn, from the amusing Smendrick and the strong Molly the tragic Unicorn and the wrecked king Haggard. And even though you instantly &quot;see&quot; each character, they are all more than what they apear to be. All of them seem to have that second layer wich makes them deeper and more meaningul. They are both simple and many-layered. And all of them are tragic, and yet filled with hope.<BR>The story is written in a language full of delightful images, with so musical lines its almost like poetry from time to time. I´ve never read anything quite like this book, and that is saying a lot. Scenes and sentenses keep popping back into my head, even when I´m thinking about something quite unrelated.<br />But the thing that really sets this book apart is that even though it is wonderfuly inreal, it feels true. It feels though the world of the unicorn is more true than the real world. It almost hurts to go back.<br />Go on. Buy this book. Spend a few hours in a magical dream-land. We all need some enchantment in our lives.
B00006LPER|5.0|THE PIANO TEACHER goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet.  In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings.  This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy.  Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten.  Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict.  The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilharation that mirror the life inside a music academy.  We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and dsitorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students.  Yes, this is a distrubing film, but it is not a grotesque film.  Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches.  An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice.  An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.
0395389496|4.0|Van Allsburg is one of my favorite storytellers and this charming X-mas tale is no exception.  Holiday stories can be a bit preachey and sappy sweet but this one maintains the authours mystery and sophistication.  As with all his books, the narritive and illustrations maintain a dreamlike quality that will appeal to all ages.<br />Not one of my favorite Allsburg stories, I prefer \\"Just a Dream\\" and \\"The Sweetest Fig\\", but one that will occupy a proud and well deserved space on my bookshelf.<br />Do yourself a favor and read everything by him, no matter how old you are.

B00006M183|4.0|This is a good albumn but not a great one, unfortunately.  I feel like Pearl Jam could be putting out better stuff then they are.  There are some great moments on this albumn though.  &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; is one of the best Pearl Jam songs ever: its chorus is both catchy and climactic, its verses are driving and its lyrics are both meaningful and beautiful (i.e. &quot;Is this just another phase/of earthquakes making waves/trying to shake the cancer off/stupid human beings/once you hold the hand of love/ it's all surrmountable).  &quot;Cant Keep,&quot; &quot;I am Mine,&quot; &quot;Thumbing my way,&quot; &quot;Green Disease,&quot; and &quot;All or None&quot; are all solid tracks.  All in all this is a must have for Pearl Jam fans and it's certainly the superior of Binural and perhaps some other PJ albumns as well.
0060523794|5.0|Lou Gerstner has succeeded in writing a book which both provides valuable insights into the computer industry and the situation and success of IBM, as well as providing a roadmap for leaders seeking to effect strategic change in any industry.  He reveals that IBM was close to running out of cash in 1993 before he stepped in and kicked out the investment bankers (later pilloried as greedy suppliers of the \\"hooch for all of the wild speculative periods in our economic history\\") who were preparing to sell of IBM, a national treasure, in pieces.<br />The book is easy to read, non-technical, and laced with interesting anecdotes.  <br />Turning around IBM was one of the greatest business achievements of our time.  I have worked much of my career in companies that competed against IBM and have known many ex-IBMers.  All continue to have great respect for the people and the organization.  There is no question that IBM had, and has, some of the best people in the world.  Yet, they became unable to execute appropriate strategies quickly, losing much of their market share in the process.  <br />Lou Gerstner rejuvenated the company, a task which is rarely permanently successful in the high technology world.  Today, IBM still sells mainframes (much less expensive now, but an extension of the basic architecture introduced in 1964).  And, that technology is still at the center of the IT organizations of many of our largest companies.  Introduced later, but now long gone, are the Digital VAX, the Intel 8080, the Zilog Z80 and various computer architectures from the likes of Prime, Wang, Data General, etc.  Most have been replaced by Unix or Windows.<br />We have Lou Gerstner to thank for saving IBM.  As the book describes, he did it by focusing on the customer, eliminating useless bureaucratic processes, and, as a non-engineer, understanding the business implications of technology change better than most within IBM.  But, it was execution, focus on cash flow and profits over revenues, and constant attention to detail in strategic planning and monitoring, together with communications and leadership which saved the day for IBM.<br />The title is interesting.  Elizabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School Professor, wrote Teaching Elephants to Dance in 1989.  Gerstner refers to some of her other works late in the book, but not this one, which appears to have provided the inspiration for the title of his book.

B00006CXSS|5.0|A bonus feature included with the DVD set provides a hint at what makes this production a one-of-a-kind classic.  An actor, Ron Livingston, kept a video diary of the beginning stages of his involvement in the production.  We see him beginning to research his role of Lewis Nixon, Battalion and Regimental intelligence officer by reading Stephen Ambrose histories and 1940's field manuals.  He meets Lewis Nixon's widow and pores over photos of the man he's playing.  We see him awed by a telephone call with the REAL commander of Easy Company, Dick Winters,in which he promises to do his best in acting the part of Winters' lifelong friend. <br />THAT's part of what makes this production special.  The writers did additional research for each episode, in many cases interviewing the surviving members or family of Easy Company.  The actors did the same, in many cases calling from the set to run a line reading by the vet they were playing.  The Easy family members speak fondly of \\"our actor,\\" the one who played their vet.  All of that bonding and commitment to getting it right comes through on the screen.  <br />This is an off-the-charts production that repays repeated viewings.  I cannot speak of it too highly.
6304925131|3.0|I heard the audio tape, before I bought the video. I think that the book is better than the film, although the film is fine. If I should say something that I do not like about this film, it must be that the women come out so weak. The only one that tries to work out something on her own, is the sick boy's mother. She has been fighting for her son's life. Sadly, this is a battle she loses.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|I loved Blade and was very much anticipating the release of Blade 2.  Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to my expectations.<BR>I hate giving this a bad review but I found it completely implausible and had trouble getting lost in it like I did for it's predecessor.<BR>I think the acting was severely downgraded, the story was weak and the action was the sole basis for this getting 2 stars.<BR>Hard core fans will enjoy it, but I have a hard time believing some of these reviews saying it was better than the original.<BR>I've even rented it to make sure that I wasn't in a bad mood that day- nope just another poor follow up sequel that they had hopes to launch into a franchise.  No word of Blade 3 because this one did so poorly.<BR>Only die hard fans need apply, all others will be left wanting so much more.
0316666343|5.0|Once I started I couldn't stop reading this book.  This is a totally different perspective in that it tells the story through the eyes of  the victim of a brutal murder.  The writing was outstanding in that you can visualize the places and people along with her perspective of what \\"heaven\\" is.  You will laugh and cry as you see what happens to the lives of Susie's family along with her experinces past and present.  I am looking forward to reading more of Alice Sebold's works she is a gifted writer.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire had so much potential and a great new story line that I was looking forward to how it was displayed on the big screen.  Figured there were some good actors, special effects- this was going to be good.<br />It wasn't.  Matthew McConaughey was horrible.  He delivered lines like he was pretending to be a pig in labor- all grunts and couldn't understand a thing he said.<br />The action was mediocre at best since you rarely if ever get any scenes of the dragon!  They are few and poorly done.  If the lack of dragon scenes was to inspire fear/curiosity through anticipation it fell flat- looked to me like the budget ran short so they couldn't have too many special effects.<br />I wish I had better things to say, but this is a slapped together B film that is may be worth a rental on a sick day.  Not worth a purchase or the[money] bucks I paid to go see it in the movie theater.
B000068TPN|4.0|Wow! this is a good movie, especially if you like true stories. If your like a movie with a good story, then you should see this movie. This is one of those movies that made me cry and laugh at the same time (more crying than laughing) I watched it 2 times so far, the first time I saw it I missed some important things and thought it could have been better, but the 2nd time i realized that i had just seen a really great movie, twice. The first time I saw this movie I thought there were too many battle scenes, but the 2nd time I watched it, I realized that these were real caricters.......this was a true story......these men really &quot;were soldiers&quot; and the long battle scenes made me feel these peoples pain. Mel Gibson played a part that made me admire and respect him, and made me want a leader just like him if I were in battle. The &quot;behind the scenes&quot; special feature lets us meet the real caricters and see how close the actors came to portraying these real carciters. These soldiers went to battle because their country told them too and while there they survived by helping and fighting for each other, they looked after each othrt because each other was all they had.
B00005JKCH|5.0|With the recent adaptation of comic book heroes for movies with big budgets, I was looking forward to this film.  I'd even say I had built it up a little and was setting myself up to be disappointed.  But I wasn't.<br />Spiderman was a great film that had amazing action, a good story, told Spiderman's history pretty close to the original comic and entertained my fianc&eacute;e with a romance in it we weren't expecting.<br />The acting was very good, writing superb, and the action was great.  A fine film that everyone could enjoy (over 12 years old).  I even got the DVD set as a gift from my fianc&eacute;e and we watched it the other night.  She really enjoyed this film too.<br />The movie draws you in from start to finish like a roller coaster ride.  Very much enjoyed it and would recommend to others.
B00006M183|5.0|just bought Riot Act, day after it came out.  like most pearl jam albums the first song is great, and leads into other great songs early on the CD.<BR>there are really great songs that stand out on their own pretty well, like &quot;i am mine&quot; but as a whole the entire CD is good, there might not be earth shattering songs on this album, but every song is worth a listen.  <BR>this is really one of those albums u can listen to from start to finish, there are no downpoints or bad songs.<BR>if u like pearl jam's other stuff go grab this now, if u havent heard much of them yet, listen to &quot; i am mine&quot; first and see if its your cup of tea.  you wont be disappointed
B00003CX9Q|3.0|Who in heaven's name thought it was a good idea to re-visit this film in the editing booth?<br />FBI agents and police don't carry guns?  Upon learning of extraterrestrial invasion?  Even in a kid's movie, that stretches credibility.  (I'm glad they had radios!)  Next you'll be telling me that Han Solo didn't shoot first!  (Oh, wait!)<br />Buy it for the original version, use the new version as a coaster.
0452282152|4.0|Well, as far as I'm concerned, I thought this book was interesting as well as facinating. I first came here to amazon.com to find a book for my new class book report. I asked for historical fiction and a handfull of books popped up. Only, this was the one that caught my eye. I read a couple of reviews and the excerpt and decided to try it out. Now, I'm not the kind of person who would read a historical fiction but this one was great. I found it interesting, not boreing at all. It was very mezmerizing and I could never put it down. I finished in a week and told all my friends about it. They too were hooked.
B00000342V|5.0|\\"Superfly is 1 of the 5 Greatest Albums EVER, but the mix is HORRENDOUS! May I say that Rhino has always done a wonderful job with re-issued music. I thoroughly enjoy Curtis Mayfield's \\"Curtis\\" & \\"Roots\\", especially \\"Roots\\". The packaging & sound are AMAZING. So when I received my \\"Superfly\\" cd in the mail, I was expecting the same thing. The packaging was the best I've ever seen. It had so much content & information that I was blown away. I put the cd in my player & I hear the worst mix EVER! <br /> Now mind you about 5 years ago, I bought the original cd release by CURTOM CLASSICS & was pleased by the sound. There was a lot of clarity & it was an improvement from the lp. I was expecting an even better sound from the re-release from Rhino. I was GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. This cd sounds like somebody made a tape from the lp. There's this fuzzy noise in the background, no clarity, no treble, no separation of sounds & the mix as a whole is muddy & muffled. The RECORD sounds better!<br /> This is a shock to me considering the fact that \\"ROOTS\\" was AWESOME. It's probably the best mix by Rhino. But \\"Superfly is a dramatic step DOWN. The original cd by Curtom was a better mix. ... The packaging was WONDERFUL, but the sound needs to be just as good.
6300274195|5.0|After twelve years, six VHS tapes and one DVD later DUMBO is still my favorite Disney film, if not greatest film for me, of all time. The summary should already be known through the reviews, so I shall not bother to say more on that. However, I must say that I was rather alarmed at the number of people who were frightened by the Pink Elephant scene. People are talking about the alcohol in Dumbo as if that was the very first time alcohol was in a Disney film (Pinocchio). The scene of colorful, and yes odd, but in a delightful way - the fun of watching the elephants change shape and backgrounds through various acts of oddity. \\"Baby Mine\\" is a challenge to sit through when there are no tissues available. \\"When I See an Elephant Fly\\" is punny and lighthearted. Yes some of the themes are depressing (being torn from mother and being mocked), but when I compare this film with other Disney films this still comes out on top. I could have even told anyone this at age 4, nothing has changed but my love for the movie, which has increased at an exponential rate.<br />*Turn on sarcasm radar now* Other reviewers are right. No one wants to watch a film in which a character must overcome social problems that he cannot change. Or a film that is willing to delve into adult themes while still capable of appearing to be nothing more than a cute film. Yes this film is too frightening for kids - now lets watch some lion kid's dad being trampled by antelopes, and a lion being eaten alive by hyenas, or a giant sea witch getting impaled, or hear the sounds of a deer's mother being shot, or a CGI film in which mutilation and torture are okay because they are just toys, or a film in which children are changed into jackasses from drinking.*
B00006V9A0|5.0|Kurt does not live.  Nirvana did not change the world.  If they had, this disc would not exist just in time for the Christmas rush and no one would be making scads of money from its sales.  It is a fairly comprehensive selection from almost the entirety of Nirvana's brief existence.  The hits (the evergreen 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'; 'Come As You Are') are of course righfully included, as are several lesser-known and not-too-hard-to-find tracks. If you do not already have any Nirvana this is an excellent place to start, and quite possibly stop.  The liner notes are pretty informative, too, and the packaging is attractively, if dutifully, stark and somber.  Guess you can't really go wrong with this one, but it would have been nice if tracks from, say, the early Sub-Pop EP were included.  The CD clocks in at only 50 minutes, which leaves much room for improvement.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act is Pearl Jam's strongest, most consistent effort since 1996's No Code.  The band sounds more confident and more daring than either 1998's Yield or 2000's Binaural, though each of those releases contained major leaps and highlights.<br />What sets Riot Act apart is the subtle quirkiness and power hiding in every song.  It's a difficult album to get used to--and you won't find yourself humming along to many of the songs until around the 4th or 5th listen. There's a lack of traditional rock &quot;hooks&quot; that many rock radio listeners might find disconcerting.<br />But with repeated listenings, patience, and open-mindedness, the brilliance and fun of Riot Act is revealed.  Odd time signatures and chord progressions abound, as in Cameron's powerful &quot;Cropduster,&quot; and Ament's strange, amelodic &quot;helphelp.&quot; Yet there are moments of sheer beauty and delicacy, as in Vedder's &quot;Thumbing My Way,&quot; and the nicotine whiskey closer &quot;All Or None,&quot; which is destined to be a classic in the Pearl Jam canon.<br />Much will be made of the political content of such songs as &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; and &quot;Green Disease,&quot; which is at turns humorous, passionate, and ahem, infectious--but none of which would mean anything if it weren't couched in the only musical setting worth listening to in mainstream rock music.<br />Whether or not the hype dies down, Riot Act will be one of the best rock releases of the year, and is recommended along with the import single for &quot;I Am Mine,&quot; which includes two previously unreleased b-sides, &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Undone,&quot; which are well worth the price.
0671027344|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, it's phenomenal, amazing, fantastic, awesome! There just aren't enough adjectives to descrbe it! Charlie is so easy to identify it, the plot is great and the format is unbelievably easy to read. Love it! Buy this book!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman has to be one of the best comic book to big screen adaptations to come out in quite some time.  Everybody of course knows the standard plot line with Spiderman.  Peter Parker is the high school student who isn't physically overwhelming and is picked on by other students.  He has of course the woman he's seriously in love with in the stunningly beautiful Kirsten Dunst.  On a school trip to a museum, he's bitten by a radioactive, DNA hyped up spider and there's your story.  We see him going through the learning process of how to become Spiderman and use his newfound powers which is hilarious and amazing.  His foe for this first of probably several new Spiderman movies is the Goblin.  Willem Dafoe's performance is absolutely wonderful and probably the best acting job I've seen him do in some time.  The fight scenes in this movie are right up there with \\"The Matrix.\\"    <br />This is an emotionally uplifting and wonderful movie that you can take your family to and everybody will enjoy!  Other reviewers have stated that some of the fight scenes might be a little too much for younger children.  The fight scenes in this great movie are no worse than many of today's popular video games and the shows on TV geared towards these same children.  For those that want a little more than what is put on the screen, I might also suggest the paperback, written by Peter David.  The second disk has scores of extra stuff with something of interest for everybody.  This DVD is an excellent addition to your DVD collection.  Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for the next movie!
B00006JSS8|2.0|I suppose it is my own fault if I disagree with the material selection...it is a highly subjective matter.  Personally I think there is too much of the earliest stuff on it that was made before he hit his mature genius.  However, it is inexcusable that the recording quality is so dreadful!  There are remastered versions of this material available that sound wonderful, and much of this sounds like a transistor radio.  Another rip-off by a record label on us.  One wonders if the engineers who put this stuff together have any pride at all in their work.  I see no evidence of it here!
B0000648WZ|1.0|Most of the things that make Starship Troopers a great book are completely lost in the movie version.  It was like watching 90210 in space.
6302719631|5.0|I found this to be a remarkably engaging piece, especially owing to it's idiosyncacies with respect to the indulgent, poetic licence that the director, producer, musical score evoked.<BR>How very eighties the score was....it was a welcome reprise. <BR>I agree that the music was somewhat incongruous with respect to the historical time frames, but I felt it added to the appeal.<BR>Peter Firth was earnest, nay, strikingly elegant in his portrayal of Henry Firth.  I found the final scene, with his emerging from the mist as profoundly harlequin-like, but acceptably satifsying.<BR>Katherine Schlesinger's wide eyed stares were occasionally a little difficult to understand, and I felt that perhaps she should elect to have her thyroid levels checked.  The gothic scenes initially put me off, however, I do believe that with the passage of time, I grew accustomed to them, and as a result they were less and less objectionable.<BR>On the whole, I have to confess that I loved this venerable production.
0446607274|5.0|Connelly is on top form in this installment of the Harry Bosch series.  Angels Flight, a suspenseful tale of murder and police corruption in Los Angeles, a city on the brink of imploding, is one of Connellys best.  As usual, the characterizations are superb. Bosch and gang are memorable in the pursuit of a murderer that could be from their own ranks and the depiction of LA is atmospheric and grimly realistic.  I highly recommend this for fans of crime fiction.
B00003CXA2|3.0|& the over-the-top praise this movie received certainly certifies that bromide. But it has its funny moments, kind of an extended R-rated Gomer Pyle. However it just goes on & on & on & on & on for so long & it slathers on shameful amounts of sentimental goo plus every conceivable film cliche without being in any way witty. Oh well, as my mama used to say, that's just like us, ain't it? It's worth 2 1/2 *s actually.
B000021XR5|3.0|After Scott Weiland released a solo album and STP did a side project called Talk Show, it seemed that STP's days were done.  In 1999 \\"No.4\\" was released to lukewarm sales numbers mostly due to the fact that STP couldn't tour because Weiland's drug troubles landed him in jail again.  When Weiland was finally released, he and STP began a huge tour and \\"No.4\\" finally started to sell very well thanks to the success of the hit single \\"Sour Girl\\" (one of STP's poppiest, simplist, and overrated songs).  Songs like \\"Down\\", \\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\", \\"Chruch On Tuesday\\", and \\"No Way Out\\" are simplistic and catchy, while \\"MC5\\" and \\"Sex & Violence\\" are injected with a punkish vibe.  While \\"No.4\\" isn't a bad album at all (although it could have been a bit longer), it doesn't have any of the raw emotional feel that STP's previous albums had, and it just sounds more poppier and radio friendly.  But then again, maybe STP is just trying (along with a few other bands like Pearl Jam and maybe Jerry Cantrell) to reclaim the crown that was stolen by bands like Creed, Nickelback, and Puddle of Mudd.
B000001ESP|5.0|When I was in college, a guy down the hall from me who owned a massive high-powered stereo system got into the habit of playing \\"Moving Pictures\\" every day. Daily at around 3:00 in the afternoon, when I returned from my calculus class, I would hear Neil tapping out the Morse Code letters \\"Y-Y-Z\\" twice on his high-hat, followed by incredibly loud power chords playing the same pattern.<br />After about a month of this, the floor pothead politely knocked on the Rush fan's door and said, in a blurry-sounding voice, \\"Dude, like, Moving Pictures is a great album and all, man, but, like, do you HAVE to play it every single day?\\"<br />Well, yes, he did. Because Moving Pictures could be the best rock album ever recorded. Beatles and Floyd and Stones and Zep fans may disagree, but I truly believe one would be hard-pressed to find a more consistent collection of solid tunes ever made.<br />In Paris is housed the Standard Meter -- a bar of metal exactly a meter long, encased in a special inert gas to prevent expansion or contraction. If there were to be a Standard Rush Album kept in Toronto under a glass dome, used as the measure against which all other Rush albums were to be gauged, this would be it.<br />The musicianship is uniformly tight, the Three Men From Willowdale meshing together like teeth on a zipper. Neil's drumbeats are crisp and staccato, Geddy's bass grumbles and roars like a dragon, and Alex reaches stratospheric heights like never before.<br />Put on Moving Pictures, and you're immediately a teenager again, not entirely satisfied with hair-metal, definitely not into teeny-pop, brooding, sensitive, captured by the group's musical depths, enraptured by Neil's intellectual lyrics.<br />Nothing more need be said -- and can be said.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane generally is considered the greatest film ever made.  It has top numerous lists (including AFI's Top 100 American Films) and is revered by practically every movie critic.  While some film has to rank number one, and Citizen Kane deserves the title as much as any film, actually watching the film is a bit of a letdown.  That is not to deny the film's greatness.  Orson Welles directed, co-wrote and stars in the film and he set the standard for the likes of Woody Allen and Spike Lee to command the three major components of a movie.  No one else reached the levels of greatness that Mr. Welles reached with Kane.  His acting is brilliant, the screenplay is sharp and his directing is first rate.  The fact that he only won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was a commercial bomb shows that the Academy and film going public weren't ready to accept this progressive film and how he was ahead of his time.  The actors in the film were apart of Mr. Welles' Mercury Players and they all (especially Joseph Cotton) give strong turns.  Going back to my point about the film being a bit of a letdown, I mean with all the praise and superlatives that are heaped on the Citizen Kane, the film has set such an impossible buildup, it may not meet the modern film fan's expectations.  The bonus disk is worthy of a separate release itself.  It contains the documentary, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which itself was nominated for an Oscar, that is one of the better documentaries about Hollywood that has been produced.  Orson Welles was a true movie visionary, but despite the fact that he would go on to create many first rate films, he was never able to duplicate the greatness of Citizen Kane.

B00003CXSP|1.0|This movie contains the most disturbing scene I've ever seen on film. I won't even describe it. It's sad that Hollywood puts out this trash, even sadder that an actor such as Anthony Hopkins contributes to it, and even sadder that millions of people apparently find gratuitiously gory portrayals of cannibalism entertaining. :-(
0684843749|3.0|This is a well written book, but is not for everyone. It depends on what you are looking for. It's well worth the price if <br />1) you are looking for a source of all possible exercises and how do them right.<br />2) want to learn about this history about the sports, and some great champs from 50's/60's/70's. the book is full of inspirational photos.<br />However the nutrition section is dated, not a whole lot of info on preventing injuries. The workout plan that Arnold outlines is simply insane. You need to rest each body part a week, and not 1-2 days as Arnold says. It would work if you are on steroids.
B00005QW5X|5.0|The first time I saw this DVD, I had borrowed it from a friend. Rocky Horror 2? Sure, I'll check it out. I now realize that comparing Hedwig to Rocky Horror is like comparing Goodfellas to Cabin Boy. The first thing I noticed was how the movie drew me in, from the fantastic opening number to the final credits. I had such a good time. But actually realizing how great the film is, catching the little details, didn't start until the second viewing. I'm now on viewing number five and I'm still finding nuggets of brilliance -- I just noticed something interesting about Hedwig's tattoo, which appears in one of the first and last scenes (pay close attention). The songs are all incredible, the performances uniformly sublime. The ambient noise throughout is surprisingly well done; in the restaurant scenes you can barely hear people ordering chicken fingers, with glasses breaking at extremely humorous moments. The editing -- everyone has the perfect expression in every shot (I love the unwitting audience members). The early scene of Yitzhak trying on the wig carries a Shakespearean depth and import. Nothing in this film is tossed in at random; everything has a significance and you could write papers unpacking its richness. The theme of tomatoes being thrown and subsequently eaten is an interesting recurring thread not many people pick up on. This is artwork of the highest calibre. Yeah, if you're uptight about gender and sexuality, the film may trouble you. But watch with an open mind and the universal themes will touch you. You will walk away a changed person.
B00006M183|4.0|I like this record as I do all of Pearl Jam's output. I just feel that some songs that had catchy riffs or melodies at certain points did not go on to fulfil their potential which is a shame. You're left just wishing the chord progression had taken a slightly different path in some songs in an effort to be that bit catchier. The single 'I Am Mine' is a great song as is 'Love Boat Captain' and 'Save You'. The music itself is in some ways more challenging and mature than anything that has gone before. It follows on from Binaural in a similar vein to that record. At times experimental, lovely, rocking and just plain wierd(see 'Bushleaguer' - a great spoken word politically themed song - and the chanting in 'Arc') this album has obviously benefited from a solid mix of creative inputs. Maybe I haven't listened to it enough yet but I feel it needs a stronger ending. All gripes aside I believe it will be great in the live arena.<BR>So 4 stars from a big fan - maybe on further reflection 5.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth, not merely music but rather a listening experience.  With the release of their sixth album, Deliverence the band delves more deeply into their death metal roots.  All the brutality of Ackerfeldt's grunts, growls, and screams are present as are a plethera of melodic rythym and lead guitars.  Compared to Orchid, Still Life, and Blackwater Park (I havn't heard My Arms or Morningrise) this album has much much much more of a death metal feel to it; there are even a series of more grindy riffs not common in the guitar-driven and classic rock oriented Sweedish death metal scene.  This is not a bad thing and indeed it makes the album stand out as different.  The only downfall of the album in my opinion is the fact that the acoustic passages which on Orchid have an enchanting flow to them that merges the music together perfectly, are absent on deliverence.  Not totally absent as acoustics make up a large part of the Opeth sound; they are however boring and redundant on Deliverance and seem to lack the emotion of the accoustics heard on Orchid or Still Life.  All in all, this is still Opeth and this album is a must have for all Opeth fans.
B00006IR5S|5.0|What an amazing alnum. It really brings to life all of the themes of harry potter and really compliments the first album Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. If you think you might want this item don't hesitate to but it.
B00006M183|5.0|First of all, I would like to emphasize- if you aren't a big Pearl Jam fan but you might be curiously browsing this title, this one is definitely worth your money.  If you are a rock and roll fan in a very traditional sense, get the album.  If you are a country fan, pick up this album!  <br />Pearl Jam is one of the few rock and roll bands in history that can manage to pull off albums with consistantly GOOD music, track by track.  Even if you don't like a song or two, you will still think everything else is great.  Riot act is no exception.  On this album, we find the band evolving even further.  Their lyrics are better written than previous albums, and highly intelligent as always.  The guitar work is consistantly improving from the other albums (this is perhaps because they allowed more actual solos than in previous ones, excluding Ten).  If you can absorb the the merits of the songs ontop of your own personal opinions on them, you will find the experience to be mature one that leaves the listener highly satisfied.  On a side note, the final song &quot;All or none&quot; does not give traditional closure, but rather evokes the feeling of continuing along a path.  I hope to continue along the path with this band.  They deserve my utmost respect with this release.  <br />Personal Favorite- &quot;Thumbing my Way&quot;- I think if they released it as a single, you'd see grown men, (even in pick up trucks!!) driving down the highway with tears streaming down their face.  It's that good.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is my second favorite musical of all time. Second only to Annie Get Your Gun (the broadway version). THis movie really has lots of funny things in it and is a must buy for musical fans.
B000067CPX|5.0|I thought that californication was a stepping stone just like blood, sugar, sex and magic.  But the latest release???  When I heard the first single on the radio I tholught I was in for another excellent release from these guys, and I thought right.  What I didn't figure on was them taking it to another level.  There seems to be, in most artists careers, on break through release, the one that can't be beat.  This has to many songs to count, to many good songs to count and not a single filler.  This is unbelivable and gets better with every listen.
B00005N9CV|3.0|THE LOOK OF LOVE is definitely one of Diana's better albums.But,I do agree with some of the previous reviews-her vocals don't have enough &quot;beef&quot; on this album.It does sound like she's half asleep on a few tracks.As far as the ongoing debate over whether she's a real jazz singer,I would say she's most definitely a jazz singer(you could hardly call this music &quot;pop&quot;).Although from a personal point of view,I would probably say that Karen Carpenter is more of a jazz singer than Diana-even though Karen's repertoire is only about 25% jazz.While Karen's phrasing and vocal technique is similar to Sarah Vaughan or Nina Simone,Diana is more comparable to Astrud Gilberto.

B00005JLRR|4.0|First, I'm not one of the Trek-hounds who seem to know everything pertinent before the movies are released.  I recommend that you take a look at the cast for this one.  From the trailers I've seen there's no indication that so many TNG series characters are in this flick... however, they're on the cast list.   That's made me even more excited about seeing Nemesis.  <BR>btw... where's Ambassador Spock?  Isn't he supposed to be on Romulus on special assignment, to strengthen ties with the Romulans and influence their culture in a positive manner ?
B000065U1N|3.0|This one was hard core war porn- lots of violence surrounded by little or no plot to speak of.  I suppose that's what real war stories are, but the movie left me cold and disturbed.  I wouldn't really recommend this one, the pacing is erratic, the characters are fairly shallow and poorly developed, and the editing makes you nauseous.  There are far better war flicks out there.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I think it was the Beatles who called Elvis &quot;the man with a rainbow in his throat&quot;. How right they were.
B0000026WD|5.0|some ppl say it flopped, some ppl say the scandals overshadowed it..<BR>i say this is JAM PACKED with more hits than ur money can buy on any other cd out there,, do urself a favour, instead of spending money on any cd, this is the one thats worth the money. &quot;who is it&quot; has a tune that would haunt ur dreams, it's a true classic, other all time greats include &quot;Remember the time&quot;, &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;In the Closet&quot;, &quot;black or white&quot;, and the ballad &quot;heal the world&quot;. i dont know how any music fan can miss out on this one.<BR>peace.
B00006CXXU|4.0|After you've listened to this record, you would never compare Christina to the other teen pop stars again. You will start comparing her to Alicia Keys, Whitney and Mariah. Yes, it is that good. <br />She listened to the critics and stop overdoing it with bountiful, unnecessary high notes and focused more on emotion. With the exception of &quot;Dirrty&quot;, every song on this album is exceeded my expections by a mile and then some. My mouth literally dropped open when I heard the ballads, &quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot;. &quot;Impossible&quot; featuring Alicia Keys, &quot;I'm OK&quot;, and the Pink-tinged, &quot;Underappreciated&quot; are some of the other standout tracks. <br />I am not a big pop fan. I like jazz and indie European artists who most Americans have never heard of. So, even if you aren't a pop fan, you will not be disappointed by this cd. Christina  has a long career ahead of her.
B00006V9A0|3.0|I love Nirvana and some other alternative so I was excited to hear that they had a greatest hits album coming out. Most of album is great. A couple songs were mediocre b-sides, and should not have been included on this ablum. They screwed up something that should have been wonderful.
B00006RAKP|2.0|When record labels usually release Greatest Hits collections, there is most of the time, a miss that comes within the collections. That case came exactly right here with the music of Elton John. Although he has been making music for more than 30 years, not even all of his songs can come into a full collection.<br />The 2002 Greatest Hits 1970-2002, compiles over 30 of Elton's biggest songs in his entire career, including Your Song, Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word, and I'm Still Standing. Although it seems to be the maximum of massive hits for Elton John, I was truly surprised, because there were at least a dozen of Elton's hit songs that didn't even make the collection like Candle In The Wind 1997, The Last Song, Empty Garden, Club At The End Of The Street, and Someday Out Of The Blue. It seems to be a sad state of affairs when record labels can't even do it right.<br />Unfortunately, this collection isn't exactly a good collection of Elton John's career. You're better off getting the re-released box set, To Be Continued..., or expecting a seperate Greatest Hits collection of Elton John's music from the 1990's and beyond.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man is one of the better comic book adaptations to come to the big screen. I was surprised that Toby Maguire did a great job as the young superhero. Dafoe's sinister green goblin was exquisite as well. Some of the best scenes are Spider-Man swinging from building to building--those are just jaw-dropping awesome. The plot is mediocre though. It is an excellent choice to watch though and surprisingly fun.
0316666343|5.0|In real life terrible things happen like little kids being abducted and killed.  We all grieve.  We all believe that our loved ones look down on us when we die.  This is a story of a young girl who meets a horrible demise and then tells the story of what the people she left behind go through as a result.  I loved this book.  But, of all the Oprah recommended books I've read, I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You is by far the best.  I recommend both.  As for Lovely Bones, get it.  What an imagination on this author.
B0000039QP|5.0|I just can't beleive how talented this man The Notorious B.I.G. was and this album really bring the man to his peak. the edited version is very impressive which I can now play at school partys and events from felow freinds and co-workers.
B00006F7S4|5.0|The only previous Beck album I had heard was Odelay and I must admit I didn't care for it that much.  Sea Change, however, is in a totally different class, as though recorded by a different artist.<br />Whatever it is that bums this guy out, let's make sure it sticks around.  This album is stunning, plain and simple.  Melodic, moody, but strangely enough NOT depressing, this album is a shot in the arm and renews my faith in music.
B0000039PW|5.0|This album has all the elements to drop of a classic debut and it's was very interesting to that biggie Smalls developed his skills of rapping from the life that witnees in his hood. Great collection of songs which are very emotional and dark, witty and enlighting, real and ruff...so many things that express to me that Biggie Smalls was very talented.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is by far the best film I've seen in years.  This film should be the example to which all future historical dramas should look for inspiration.  The acting, sets, script, direction, music, special effects and cinematography all shine.  Well worth the money and time.
B0000039QA|5.0|I was amazed when I purchased this CD. It had the commercial and underground balance that I didn't espect which is very impressive. The album is very dark and very lyrical. the mast at work, Notorious B.I.G. did it B.I.G. Style and he gave his listeners what they wanted, the truth.
B00006M183|3.0|Pearl Jam has been one of my absolute favorite bands for a long time now, and I always look forward to anything they do. This album was no exception. The first single &quot;I Am Mine&quot; is probably the best song on this album in my opinion, but it is by no means the only good one. If you had to compare this to any of their previous albums I would have to compare it to &quot;No Code&quot;. I say that because it is kind of hard to grasp at times. &quot;No Code&quot; had plenty of good songs on it, but no real amazing ones. Same goes for this album. The song &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; reminds me alot of &quot;I'm Open&quot; from No Code, in that it's more of a strange spoken word track than a song. Another thing that I always look forward to in Pearl Jam albums is that they always find an interesting way to package them. This album is packaged very well, but pretty much the same as Binaural. (I realize that the packaging isn't that important, don't worry) Another thing that i noticed is that Eddie Vedder doesn't seem to use his voice like he used to. On songs like &quot;Black&quot; (which is one of the most beautiful songs of all time) &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;, and &quot;Why Go&quot;, you can really hear the intensity and emotion in his voice. With the past few albums (including this one), his voice usually stays at a certain level, and doesnt really convey as much emotion. But he still remains one of my all-time favorite vocalists. Overall, this album isn't amazing like Vs. or Vitalogy, but it's still a very good one. I recommend this for any Pearl Jam fan, but if you're just getting into them, i'd  recommend buying Vs. or Ten first.
0767830520|2.0|I had heard so much about this film that actually seeing it was an anticlimax.  One of the best films ever?  I don't think so.  I prefer De Niro's later work and found that parts of the film really dragged.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|One of the saddest films I have seen in recent years is this film with an outstanding performance from Ellen Burstyn.  A movie that shows the real tragedy of drugs and doesn't leave anything to the imagination.  It had me thinking for days afterwards.  A must-see for those who like to count their blessings!
B00000IQC8|5.0|The Indie movie that got Kevin Smith and Co. their start in the business. Clerks was easily one of the best ones because it was funnier than all hell and completely messed up (some parts in the movie like when Dante talks to Veronica about her previous boyfriends!).<br />I will say, Clerks has the film quality of a dead rat. The images are really unclean and slmost raspy in a way because of it's stile of film (Black and White). This might be a turn off for some people but I assure you that what's in the movie is what really counts like story itself, the comedy and everything else. Honestly, you have to overlook the film quality before you judge this movie.<br />Great movie, check out Clerks first if you've never seen a Kevin Smith movie. After that, check out Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma and of course the mother load, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Again, very cool, check it out!
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man is not a perfect movie.  But it does so many important things right that it can be forgiven for its weaker points.  Most importantly, it is a fun, kinetic movie that doesn't let up.<br />The most successful element of Spider-Man is its inspired choices in personnel.  Director Sam Raimi brings his manic visualization skills to the film, making Spidey's famous &quot;webswinging&quot; as exciting as they can be, without undue showing off.  And the casting is simply brilliant.  Tobey Maguire was made for this role.  Not only does he nail the physical elements (his transformation from thin bookworm to stringily muscular acrobat, the shyness and awkwardness), but he is especially marvellous at expressing Spidey's chatty, self-deprecatory sense of humour.  The best performance of his career so far.  Kirsten Dunst was a terrific choice for Mary Jane -- while she is sometimes saddled with cheesy scenes (the final scene at the cemetary being especially disappointing), Dunst is never less than lovable.  And her kiss in the rain with an upside-down Spider-Man is probably the sexiest moment in movies this year!  Willem Dafoe deserves more screen time as Green Goblin; Dafoe is more than good enough as an actor to craft a character akin to The Joker in Tim Burton's Batman, but the script, by red-hot screenwriter David Koepp (Mission:  Impossible, The Panic Room) doesn't really allow him to explore the character's depths.  That appears to be a conscious chioce on Koepp and Raimi's part to keep the focus squarely on Peter Parker/Spider-Man, so it's forgiveable.  The one weak link is James Franco (City by the Sea), who plays Peter's best friend completely at face value, seemingly addicted to a furrowed-eyebrow expression to try to show internal turmoil but falling flat on his face.<br />The comedic elements are delightful; the origins of Spider-Man's name is a hoot, as are his interactions with Mary Jane and the Daily Bugle.  The overall sense of fun is infectious, and thestory moves along briskly enough that there are never any dull moments.<br />A great movie for sheer entertainment.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This soundtrack couldn't have been more well produced than Aesop Rock on a Dj Premier track! This just goes to show that although one tries to succeed in this rap game there will always be some (east coast) cat trying to make like it's not good enough. This album is a definite 5 stars and if it came out again in 10 years I'd give it the same.  One luv, NASA~
0316666343|4.0|This is an excellent book.  The viewpoint is one that you don't normally find.  The ending is a little disappointing, but the rest of the story more than makes up for it.  A definite read!
0061020710|5.0|If you want to see where it all begins, here it is.  We get introduced to Discworld and it's essential &quot;flavor&quot;  I have the entire series and would give it 7 stars if the rating went that high.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|First of all, DJ ENC, a soundtrack is provided as a musical score of what is occurring in the movie.   In most cases, instead of performing songs that are strictly for the movie, a cast of artists are assembled to contribute songs to the project.   In this case, the system works for the most part.  Eminem fans will be satisfied since Eminem is featured on 6 tracks, if you have the deluxe limited edition.  \\"Lose Yourself\\", the soundtrack's lead single is clearly the best song on the CD as Eminem leaves the comedy alone and actually makes a dead serious track.  He reflects on the movie's lead character, Jimmy Smith Jr. aka Bunny Rabbit, and he pours his heart and soul into the song.   The title track goes through Rabbit's trials and tribulations that he has to deal with in the movie with his family life, his job and his personal struggles.   On \\"Rabbit Run\\", Eminem raps one continuous verse without any kind of hook and definitely wins with this format.    It feels like Rabbit is able to release his rage in one verse and Eminem fans will love this song.   On the deluxe limited edition song with Em, \\"Stimulate\\", seems as if it was left off of \\"The Eminem Show\\".   While it may be a winner with diehard Eminem fans, it doesn't break any new ground for him.    Eminem is featured on  D 12's song, \\"Rap Game\\", where he even goes as far as rapping in Pig latin and on one of the best songs on the soundtrack, \\"Love Me\\" featuring Obie Trice and 50 Cent.   Eminem uses a Bob James sample and all three rappers deliver a decent performance.   Since Obie Trice and 50 Cent are now signed to Shady Records, you would expect that from them.  50 Cent even goes as far as cracking jokes on Lil Kim, Lauryn Hill, D'Angelo, Ashanti and Charli Baltimore.   Anyone that is a fan of 50's underground cuts will enjoy this song.   He also has two solo cuts on 8 Mile, \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"Places To Go\\".   \\"Wanksta\\" will sound familiar to 50 Cent fans if they follow the mixed CD circuit and the song is the 1stsingle to his full length solo CD, \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\".   Both songs will definitely create enough of a buzz until the CD drops.   Although, Obie Trice has been featured on the D 12 CD and on Eminem's \\"Drips\\" from \\"The Eminem Show\\", I would still say 50 Cent has more potential.   However, Obie doesn't disappoint on his solo cut \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" and on his 1st single \\"Rap Name\\", which is featured on the deluxe limited edition CD.   While this CD does seem like a Shady Records promotional soundtrack, other rappers make quality contribuions as well.   It seems like Nas has some more words for Jay Z on his contribution for 8 Mile, \\"U Wanna Be Me\\".   While he is currently seeking an end to the beef, it seems as if he had other things on his mind while he was performing this track.   However, this track is classic Nasty Nas as he gears his fans up for his new CD \\"God's Son\\" which will be released on December 17th.   Coincidentally,  Jay Z is featured on the same soundtrack.   Hmmmm, I guess Lil Kim was right when she said \\"Money Talks, BS walks...\\".   It seems as if Jay Z and Freeway are more worried about promoting their new releases on \\"8 Miles And Running\\" but Jay Z represents as he always does and Freeway will have even more fans waiting for his frequently delayed solo release.   Xzibit shows up with the Denaun Porter produced \\"Spit Shine\\".   Porter also produced Xzibit's first single from his latest release, \\"Man Vs Machine\\", \\"Multiply\\".   Other artists making contributions are Gang Starr, Rakim, and Macy Gray, yes that's right, Macy Gray.  Her song isn't that bad but it is definitely out of place.   Taryn Manning makes an outstanding contribution with \\"Wasting My Time\\".   Although, this slow jam is definitely out of place, if she gets with the right people, this singer will have a nice future on her hands.   Overall, I would recommend 8 Mile to anyone who is an Eminem fan.   Although 50 Cent and Obie Trice make good performances, many people may see this as aShady Records soundtrack and not a soundtrack for 8 Mile.   <br />James' Top 5<br />1) Lose Yourself- Eminem<BR>2) Love Me- Eminem, 50 Cent & Obie Trice<BR>3) Wanksta- 50 Cent<BR>4) U Wanna Be Me- Nas<BR>5) Places To Go- 50 Cent
0790729393|4.0|Yes, it's a good movie. Yes, &quot;Sleepers&quot; was a good book - BUT bear in mind it was promoted as a &quot;true story&quot; with but one thought in mind: to cause a controversy that would make it a bestseller. Now that everyone whose eyes, ears and brain are operational, knows that &quot;Sleepers&quot; is pure fiction, why does the movie studio still try to market the film as &quot;non fiction&quot;? Watch &quot;Sleepers&quot;, by all means, but remember that it's fantasy, not fact.
B000056K04|4.0|Despite years of critical acclaim and the development of a devoted fan base, the Dave Matthews Band still managed to stay right on the edge of mainstream popularity.  Aside from a few singles from their first three albums, most of their music is not 'radio friendly'.  It plays better when the full album is listened to, and is quite spectacular in concert.  <BR><BR>   Achieving mainstream success is not the brass ring every band is striving for, though.  Mainstream music doesn't exactly mean good music.  A lot of what passes as mainstream music is prefabricated, over-produced pop garbage.  In many instances, bands that developed a strong following outside of the mainstream are perceived as 'sellouts' by that loyal fan base once they make music in that area.  In this case, however, the Dave Matthews Band has accomplished a rare balancing act.  With the help of a new producer, they assembled an album of more polished, radio-friendly songs without sacrificing their musical soul in the process.  \\"Everyday\\" is an excellent album.  It will please the die-hard Dave fans while also being able to win new converts to the loyal fan base.  <BR><BR>   Ironically, the title song on this album is actually the worst thing about it.  The song \\"Everyday\\" is a very slow, plodding, boring tune that calls to mind some of the bands less successful attempts to keep a diverse range of music.  Aside from that song, though, the rest of the album is simply a listener's delight.  The odd number tracks on the first half of the album are the best of the bunch.  \\"I Did It\\" has that fast, fun sound it that makes it sound like \\"Too Much\\" off the \\"Crash\\" album.  \\"The Space Between\\" is an absolutely amazing song where the Dave Matthews Band is able to slow the music down, but still captures a wealth of emotion that really grabs the listener.  It's probably the band's best slow song this side of \\"Crash In To Me\\" (also off the \\"Crash\\" album).  \\"So Right\\" and \\"What You Are\\" keep the musical juices flowing with good tunes that are just fun to listen to.  When it is all said and done, this is probably the most accomplished album produced so far by the Dave Matthews Band.
B00005YW4H|3.0|She has a great voice, but it never changes from one song to the next. She lacks a certain inflection in her delivery &amp; sings everything in the same bluesy fashion - which is great if you don't mind a monotone CD.<br />She could be another another &quot;Chet Baker&quot; if she changed her inflection somewhat and the musical arrangement. Straight piano with a bass accompaniment gets old.
B00004TEUX|5.0|It is little known that the Swiss conductor Peter Maag originally set out to be a concert pianist, his mentor in this regard being the great Swiss/French pianist Alfred Cortot (you can hear Cortot's sense of colour and spaciousness echoed in Maag's conducting, too). One of the greatest and most underrated of conductors, Peter Maag's reputation rests largely (despite his prolific recorded output for small, obscure labels) on a handful of recordings made for Decca in the '50s and '60s: Mozart concertos with Barry Tuckwell (horn) and Gervase de Peyer (clarinet), the \\"Prague\\" and 32nd symphonies, Serenata Notturna and the Notturno for four orchestras. However, it is his Mendelssohn: the \\"Scotch\\" symphony, the Hebrides Overture and the music for \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" which has set the standard by which other performances to this day are judged....In this Maag was assisted by the magnificent production/engineering of Ray Minshull/Kenneth Wilkinson (\\"Scotch\\" symphony) and James Walker/Cyril Windebank (AMSND), the excellent state of the LSO at the time and, often overlooked, the unbelievably beautiful acoustics of the Methodist Kingsway Hall in London in which Decca's finest sound was achieved (it is now, sadly, unavailable for recording-it should be on the National Trusts's list for preservation as a recording space!). I don't think that this release will ever be surpassed. Buy it and revel in the artistry of Peter Maag and the LSO, as well as the extraordinary recorded sound of the Kingsway Hall, and Decca's marvellous FFRR recording. You won't be disappointed. One of the most sublime moments is the unforgotten Jennifer Vyvyan's singing in \\"You Spotted Snakes\\" - simply unsurpassable. The only regret is that the time available to the current cd medium is not sufficient to include Maag's unforgettable \\"Fingal's Cave\\" (although that WAS issued on cd in 1995 along with the \\"Scotch\\" Symphony and parts of the AMSND in Decca's series \\"The Classic Sound\\", which has now beensuperceded by \\"Legends\\"). If you love Mendelssohn, you can't remain without this release - it's simply, for a host of reasons, the best that's ever been (or likely to be) recorded.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This has to be one of the best CDS I own.  I first heard of them 1 week ago in my music class. The song was called &quot; The Great Debate&quot; once I heard this I had to have the cd.  Bob did a Great job mixing, lots of effects.  If you are going to be a mixer I recommend you to buy this cd. This is truly a pure rock cd.
B000002N25|5.0|.... 1) One of the few discs I would want if I were stranded on a desert island ... 2) a must-have disc if you own top-shelf audio gear... 3) This disc is worth the price of admisson just for the title track, in my opinion one of the most understated, heartrending, beautiful love songs ever written.<br />A great mix of styles and a great performance by a true songwriting and guitar-playing genius.
B00006LLLN|5.0|First of all, if you ever have the chance to see these guys live, don't hesitate--it's worth every cent. They are witty, comfortable on stage, in tune with audiences, and INCREDIBLE musicians. I've seen them play in Virginia, New York City, and now here in Louisville. The Louisville show was even better than the others, and it's well captured here. Listening recaptures that night for me, and thrills to the bone. You'll get a good taste of how much fun the concert was at the end of &quot;lucky one&quot; and during &quot;man of constant sorrow.&quot; <BR>To echo the other reviewers, I must say that Alison is a true pleasure to listen to. Likewise, the band is fantastic--crisp and ferocious, but also full of emotion and subtlety. Jerry Douglas's dobro is especially phenomenal throughout. <BR>I'll bet the DVD version of this is great (the theatre really is so beautiful, as was the stage set). If you like this, I highly recommend both AKUS's earlier cds (especially &quot;now that I've found you,&quot; &quot;new favorite,&quot; and &quot;so long so wrong&quot;) as well as Jerry Douglas's &quot;slide rule,&quot; and nickel creek's eponymous release. This is newgrass at its best--and you will be hooked!
B000005RQE|5.0|This album deftly blends REM's firmly established mysticism with its burgeoning pop sensibilities.<BR>Some of the band's best writing is here on such gems as &quot;Heron House,&quot; &quot;Exhuming McCarthy,&quot; &quot;End of the World as We Know It&quot; and &quot;Oddfellows.&quot; The production is just right.I really like Peter Buck's cow-punkish fret work on this record, and you could sense Michael Stipe coming into his own as a singer.  Definitely in the upper register of the REM canon.
B00005JKGK|5.0|One of my sisters and I watched this movie together and we laughed and cried all the way through it!  We were totally captivated - I can't say this movie is for everyone as my MIL and SIL watched it without feeling the emotions that we did but then again they're white and we're asian.  I can't say it any plainer than that.  I'm sure I would have loved this movie Asian or not but the little things that my sister and I could relate to made it so much more enjoyable - every friend of our mom's is &quot;Auntie&quot; and they love and hate each other - preferring to rate their own success and consequence by their childrens.  The characters were very real and believable - they could have been my relatives!
B00006690H|5.0|I bought this album as soon as it came out. And let me tell you it definetly exceded my expectations. Every song on the album has a great beat that is typical of Eminem's genius. He raps about his family, mainly his daughter, his parents, his ex-wife Kim, and defends himself against attacks from critics, namely Lynne Cheney, the Vice President's wife. However, other tracks such as 'Square Dance' and 'Till I Collapse' display his ability to produce a excellent beat. <br />I have purchased all of his albums, as it astounds me he is able to make each and every song on the albums a work of art that is worthy of praise of the highest level. The contents of the album are hard to praise highly enough, in which the best testimony would be to listen to the album and discover for yourself the rap genius that is Eminem. All in all, Eminem fans will be glad to note that Eminem's latest album, 'The Eminem Show,' has lived up to the highest of all expectations.
0060090367|4.0|A very quick read.  Very funny book!  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00006M183|4.0|I'll be the first one to admit that I was concerned about Riot Act.  While I'd been disappointed a little by previous efforts, their last, Binural, was perhaps the most disappointing Pearl Jam release.  I wasn't expecting another Ten but I was anticipating something better than their last effort.  And I got it.  Clearly, Pearl Jam is a band that's moved past the era of 90's grunge that gave birth to them and we shouldn't expect them to retreat anytime soon.  <br />Riot Act showcases the stripped-down sound they began experimenting with on Vitalogy and combines the best elements of No Code, Yield and Binural.  And while Riot Act finds the band in somewhat more mellow territory, the music's impact is powerful.<br />Highlights include I Am Mine, Love Boat Captain, Thumbing My Way and All Or Nothing (check out that final guitar solo!).
B00006J3WH|5.0|I am not a regular Buffy viewer, although I have many friends who are and have therefore become somewhat familiar out of self-defense.  This episode/soundtrack, however, has cast a spell on me!  I listen to this CD all the time, and love singing along. The lyrics are clever, the music is really quite good, and it's just an all around good time.  I highly recommend this for anyone who feels like having some fun!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Saving Private Ryan started a genre of WWII films whereby achieving total accuracy in both the human and military aspects of warfare was the underlying goal of the whole production.  The acting is superb; character development is very well done. Many have already raved about this series, and I could rave on about it too, it is just great, but the one area I want to expound on is the historical accuracy of this film series.  The accuracy of the battle scenes is truly fantastic, whereby the German tanks, light field howitzers and self-propelled guns are either real in some scenes but in most cases, replicated with exacting detail that would fool only the most observant WWII armor expert.  Let's face it, there are not many Tiger Is or JagdPanthers (tank destroyer) left in running condition if any at all, so it is left up to the creativity of those tasked with the production of these films to product a convincing facsimile.  In the case of the Tiger I heavy tanks, the same ones used in Private Ryan were used which were mock-ups on-top of a Russian T-34 chassis. Again, they really pulled it off, so much better than the desert-sand painted American Patton tanks serving under Field Marshall Erwin Rommel in the movie Patton (1970).  The uniforms, equipment, small arms, and sets are very accurate, and really do an effective job of transporting the viewer back to the 1944-1945 ETO.<br />This is a great series, and a very nicely done DVD collection, too bad you can't give it 10 stars because I would...
B00005LQ04|4.0|This creepy thriller is undoubtedly one of the better horror films to come out of the '70s. Argento found the perfect heroine in Jessica Harper, who plays the role of an emotionally detached American at a German ballet school. The emotional detachment that she portrays in her character adds significantly to the mood of the film. Argento also uses color for setting mood brillianty, much in the same style as Kubrik, though not with quite with the subtleness that Kubrik used color in his films. The acting of the rest of the cast is satisfactory at best, with the exception of the first two victims who shouldn't have been given any dialogue in the film. 3/5 stars for low grade acting and poor special effects. But mood, atmosphere, and suspense, the foundation of any good horror, get a solid 5/5 stars.
B00006LLLN|4.0|They have won countless music awards, released more than nine CDs, and have been hailed as some of the best musicians in the business.  But in their 15 years together, Alison Krauss and Union Station have never released a live album. . . until now.<br /><br />  On Nov. 5, bluegrass's brightest shining stars unveiled their first attempt at a live recording.  Titled simply Live, the two disc set was recorded in Louisville, KY, during last spring's New Favorite tour.  The focus of Live is mostly on the group's last two albums, New Favorite and the Grammy award winning Forget About It, with old favorites mixed in.  From the traditional flavored \\"Every Time You Say Goodbye\\" to the haunting \\"Broadway\\" to Krauss's mainstream hit \\"When You Say Nothing At All,\\" the album is effective not only in highlighting the band's recent work, but introducing fans to classic recordings as well.  Two of the group's contributions to the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack, \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" and the acclaimed \\"I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow\\" are also featured.  One of the most unique aspects of Live is the album's ability to portray the magic and intimacy of a Krauss performance.  Krauss's endearing introductions to songs, the humorous comments made by guitarist Dan Tyminski, and the ecstatic reactions of the audience perfectly capture the experience of the concert, showing listeners that seeing the band live is unforgettable.<br /><br />  Since the group's formation in the mid-1980s, Alison Krauss and Union Station have established a place for themselves as skilled, incomparable musicians, and there is no doubt that Live will become yet another addition to their accomplishments.  If you love musicians who possess nothing but talent and skill, the group's first live album is a must for your music library.
B00006G8G4|3.0|The movie itself is great. The problems of the gift set are, well; No.1, I think the interview of Stan Lee's is extremely lengthy and boring and I'm actually typing this very review as I can't stand watching it but couldn't turn it off as this is the first time I'm playing the dvd(and probably the last). My advice is, you have to be a die-hard Stan Lee's fan rather than Spider-man's(or other characters') in order to live thru watching the stupid interview; No.2, The litograph would have made us so much happier if it had had been autographed personally and not printed; No.3, how would the 35mm film cell be made 'collectible' if everyone gets to have the same segment of the same scene from the film? Basically, it's still OK to buy the gift set if you are not too fuzzy and not mind paying a little extra. Otherwise, just stick to the movie.
B0000584V3|5.0|Of all Opeth's albums (at this date in time), this is by far the most diverse and accomplished. This album has a perfect mix/master. It's sound is crisp, and very rich. You'll be swimming in it's vast soundscape.<BR><br /><br />Opeth is first and foremost a black metal band. But don't let that title scare you away. In terms of American rock bands, Opeth challenges some of the greatest talents out there, and gives us some beautiful compositions. The album is multi-faceted, diverse in several styles for your listening pleasure.<BR><br /><br /> The opening track shows Opeth's roots. It's a hard song with the singer's growls, yet half way through the 11 minute-plus dirge, he changes singing styles and utilizes actual notes. And this man can SING! His harmonies are beautiful. Strangely on the album, his growls are juxtaposed with his lyrical tones. Throughout the album you are confronted with a tapestry of sounds. For you Opeth newbies, I suggest starting on track 3, &quot;Harvest&quot;. It's an acoustic ballad, with a mellow, fairytalish background. From there you can adjust to Track 4 &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; a hypnotic stereophonic wave. It brings you in touch with Opeth's more rigid guitar riffs but doesn't completely bombard you with it like they do in the last track, &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;. As a final note, &quot;Patterns in Ivy&quot; showcases the musicians expertise at providing you with a broad listening experience. Here, the band has implented the use of a piano. It's suttle notes and rythym relay to you just how much skill this band has. If you like hard rock, and beautiful rock songs with soul, you could not possibly go wrong with Opeth's 'Blackwater Park'.<BR>
B000062YAZ|5.0|This Album Redefined all other countless cheesy Speed/Death Metal outfit's.As 1986 was Metallica's,Master of Puppet's came out while a Great Album- Last Album for Bassist Cliff Burton-R.I.P.This Album gave The Speed/Death Metal Hinge with no turning Back.While Slayer Never turned away on their roots like Metallica, Again Cliff-R.I.P..While Also wishing Slayer Their Continued Success.This Album is Definitly worth Listening to.The Opening Song,Angel of Death is Based On Joseph Mengaline,And of Auschwitz, Nazi Germany.I Like God Hate's Us All.But This and as Magazine Print's This is By far The Best Speed/Death Metal Album to Date. I Have yet to see or hear them play Necrophobic Live.Great Album, Anyway,A Must Have.
B00006SFBD|3.0|Simply, this album is not like Blackwater Park. And the artists did not set out to make a similar album. What they did make was a more straight forward, more accessible album. Opeth's style is still here, but the songs are much more basic in terms of structure and style.<BR><br /><br />But don't fret, Opeth has some really good hooks on this album. The singer has a new cryptic growl, and even a new singing voice that he utilizes on some songs. The singing seems comparable to Depeche Mode at times.<BR><br /><br />You still have 11-minute escapades on the songs, and Deliverance (the title track) is the first song to take hold of your ears. I love the super-long riff that the whip out at the end, it's nearly twenty seconds long, times that by 12 and you're looking at three minutes of abuse.<BR><br /><br />Overall, Opeth has succeeded in progressing their artistry. What they have not done, is make a timeless record. Unlike Opeth's other albums, this one probably won't stand the test of time. In my opinion the album is rather simple. Opeth only released Blackwater Park about a year and a half ago. Is that enough time to amass new material? In Opeth's case, I think not.<BR><br />
B00006IR5S|2.0|&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; represents the second big disappointment from film composer extraordinaire John Williams in 2002, the first being his lackluster, uninspiring score for &quot;Star Wars: Episode II.&quot;<br />The &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; score has little to say that wasn't already said in &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; All of the themes from the previous film appear, and they are drilled into our heads over and over and over again on this new album. The only new theme to speak of is for Fawkes the Phoenix, and it is a rather unmemorable one at that.<br />Then there's this business of the score being &quot;adapted and conducted by William Ross,&quot; yet the album liner notes insist that John Williams composed the music. Why does this sound suspiciously like they're crediting Williams for his &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; score here, and William Ross is responsible for what little new material there is to hear? Either way, Williams has not delivered.<br />Is John Williams finally tired of scoring overblown fantasy films? It certainly seems that way. He didn't even bother to write new music for the spectacular arena battle at the end of &quot;Episode II&quot; -- the film just recycled cues right out of &quot;Episode I.&quot; Sure, his &quot;Minority Report&quot; score was an interesting switch for Williams, but can you remember anything about it other than it was &quot;different&quot;? I can't.<br />After the double disappointment of &quot;Potter&quot; and &quot;Episode II,&quot; Williams can no longer be considered the premier film composer; perhaps that title belongs to Thomas Newman, Hans Zimmer or Howard Shore nowadays.
B000002KHY|5.0|I had to reach a certain level of maturity before I could really appreciate James Taylor. Some might consider him way too tame.<BR>This album is quiet and thoughtful. It's lushly recorded with crystal clarity. If you are proud of your sound system you NEED this album, number 2 also. Perfect for reflective listening with a glass of wine.
B000021XS0|5.0|This CD is great.  I think that Dream Theater is one of the most talented bands producing music right now.  The instraments alone are enough to sustain this album, infact, some people I know wish that there were only the instraments on this album.  The lyrics in my opinion are also good.  It is a modern opera set to progressive rock.  The basic storyline involves a murdered girl and two brothers.  It begins with a man being hypnotized and it is never clear whether the man is just a bystander, the girl reincarnated, or the surviving brother.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam return with their newest effort, Riot Act.  These guys know how to write great songs, and this album is no exception.  15 great tracks in all.  Don't expect another &quot;Ten&quot;.  Do expect the mellower side of PJ.  You've probably heard &quot;I am Mine&quot;, the first single, and the tempo of this track is more the rule than the exception for the whole album.  But don't let that keep you from buying this.  It's a great album, and I'm glad these guys don't put out the same LP over and over.  And don't compare it to the Chili Pepper's latest effort either.  PJ haven't changed their style, they just kept things a little more laid back.
B00006L9ZT|4.0|There are problems with this 1990 staging. The sets are glorious. (Did the ending of the Ring ever look this good?) It is beautiful to the eye and (mostly) easy on the ear. But as other reviewers have pointed out, often the acting is poor, just meandering around stage. This is especially a problem for the Siegfried. Still, given a choice between this Metropolitan production and the kinky Centenary Ring from Bayreuth, I would take this one without hesitation. I'm giving several copies for Christmas presents this year.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams has done a supurb job (with William Ross) for the music for this movie. There is a lot of music that's similar to the first movie, but that is to be expected. The theme &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot; is beautiful and fits perfectly. This music should please anyone! John Williams has done it again!
B00006AFF5|2.0|I've been a fan of Dr. Seuss's book and the original TV version of this story for as long as I can remember.  When I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical yet hopeful.  As I saw pictures, I became encouraged.  But when I actually got to see the movie, I was highly disappointed.<br />First, the good.  Everything from the costumes and people to the sets looks exactly like a Dr. Seuss story brought to life.  The cast does a wonderful job, even Jim Carrey, who I'm a marginal fan of at best.<br />However, the best part of this movie is the 30 minutes that tell the original story.  The back story, while needed to make this a full length movie, does nothing for the plot and lessons the impact of the themes regarding Christmas.  Frankly, I was bored waiting for The Grinch to start stealing Christmas.<br />My recommendation?  Skip this movie and get the Boris Karloff cartoon.  Or better yet, read the original book.  Either would be a better holiday tradition then this disappointing movie.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There is a lot of hype about a lot of new bands out there: the vines, the hives, the white stripes, the strokes.  of the &quot;the&quot; bands, the Strokes are the best.  if you think you want to get into some of this new type of music, check out the strokes first.
B00006IR5S|5.0|Well, obviously we know the 1st one was good, but this one? Chamber Of Secrets soundtrack is way BETTER than Sorcer's Stone!!!!! The music is mixed up into a better pattern and it fits better to this movie!!!!!! The music couldn't be more perfect for this movie!!! I love it and I HIGHLY reccomend it!!
B00006M183|3.0|After the shambles that was Pearl Jam's last effort-the truly forgetably Binaural, Riot Act offers up some real keepers. The first single, I Am Mine is the band's best in years. Songs like 1/2 Full and Save you show the band can still rock. Yet even on these standout songs, the listener is left with a sense of what could have been. A common feeling is that any of these songs could have been huge hits, but for some crazy reason, were messed up purposely so as NOT to appeal to the masses. Almost all Pearl Jam albums have their weirdo songs - the exceptions being their debut Ten which is solid top to bottom and INMHO the commercial flop No Code-one of their best). Vitalogy, which is a fantastic album, gave us [junk] like Bugs and Stupid Mop - Vs. gave us the ghastly Rats. This one outdoes them all with the awful song/thing/chant/whining session Bushleaguer. The audacity and hypocrisy with which Vedder attacks the president just doesn't make any sense. And you, dear listener, are lucky enough to pay for it! It's not a song, it's [bad], and it costs the album a star off its rating.<br />All in all, Riot Act is good. It's not groundbreaking, those days are past. But after the 3rd or 4th listen you realize it is their best overall since No Code. It's just not radio friendly.
B00006SFBD|4.0|After listening to &quot;Deliverance&quot; several times through, I have concluded that it is some of their finest work. Though there were rumors that this was an &quot;all heavy&quot; album with no mellow bits, there is a good mixture, but the heaviness is much more prominent. I would compare this album mostly to &quot;My arms, your Hearse&quot; only with more melody. The acoustics are extremely hard to find here, except for briefly on A fair Judgement and For Absent friends. There are also some smatterings of acoustic work throughout the other songs, but are hardly significant, in my opinion. Opeth's aim on this was obviously to focus your attention on their heavy side without overwhelming you like they did on M.A.Y.H (don't get me wrong, it's a brilliant album). My favorite songs on here are the title track, A fair Judgement, and Master's Apprentices. As a big fan of Porcupine Tree, I was thrilled to see that Steve Wilson produced it and provided some guitar work as well as backing vocals. I also hear that he will do the same for Opeth's upcoming album &quot;Damnation&quot;. So far, these are my favorite Opeth albums(most to least favorite)<BR>   1. Orchid<BR>   2. Morningrise<BR>   3. Blackwater Park<BR>   4. Deliverance<BR>   5. Still Life<BR>   6. My arms, your Hearse<BR>Over all, I applaud Opeth once again for another outstanding album. Based on this newest work of art, I can't wait for Damnation to come out in March. Bye all.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This is the best soundtrack I have ever listened to. The are many graet songs from D12, Obie Trice, 50 Cent and many others. There are also three new songs by Eminem including his brand new song \\"Lose Yourself\\". I would recomend this soundtrack to any one. If you have not seen the movie, I would also recomed anyone to go and see that.
B00000IQW3|4.0|This is pure enjoyment, no matter your age. Young love, a straight forward hero saving the world, the loyal sidekick, a truly evil villain, and a canny scoundrel. One of Robert Preston's last movies, it's a tribute to his most famous role: the scoundrel in The Music Man. The first movie to use computer graphic imaging, parts may appear dated to today's eyes, but it was just as pioneering as technicolor.<br />This one's a keeper. Enjoy it for the fun it is.
B000002505|5.0|At first you would think this collaboration would prove problematical. Fusioneer-Jazz guitarist meets Latin/Rock guitarist. Not only does it work but it works brilliantly. A departure in a sense for both. Backed by stellar musicians including Billy Cobham and Larry Young. They explore a series of complex pieces in perfect cohesion. Putting all mysticism and reservation for mysticism aside, this is excellent music. They do honor to John Coltrane with their renditions of both his masterpiece \\"A Love Supreme\\" and \\"Naima\\". The arrangement is loose and outstanding solos abound. This is not a chops-fest, however. Although, given the musicians involved, you would think. They play with great sensitivity and are always listening. This one stands  as one of his(Carlos Santana's) true masterpieces along with \\"Caravanserai\\" and \\"<br />Welcome\\". This one left you hoping for a sequel. Unfortunately it did not come making this release so much more special in the scheme of things. They brought out the best in one another. Carlos' playing is crisp and sharp without sacrifice to his expressiveness. The usually very fleet fingered John McLaughlin (then known as Mahavishnu) was especially empassioned. This album reminds me of how that particular time was so glorious in music. There was an explosion of style and new directions that was more based in musicality than in technology as is the case today. Bravo!
B00005JKDR|5.0|My children (ages 2 and 5) love this movie.  We watch it almost every day.  My 2 year old loves the scenes with Boo and it is great family entertainment.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Freed from the shackles of what Pink Floyd has become, David Gilmour sounds positively liberated on his new live DVD, David Gilmour in Concert. The years have snuck up on him, as it inevitably does to all of our heroes, but his voice is even more expressive now than it has ever been. He's actually becoming more like his long-estranged counterpart Roger Waters, and that's a good thing, a great thing in fact. <BR>  They are both world-weary veterans having finally arrived at similar crossroads in their lives after drifting apart in their not-so-distant youth. Both men's voices are thinning, sometimes straining to reach notes. While Waters is still the bleeding-heart poet, and Gilmour still the guitar virtuoso, both seem tired of the bloated excesses of the rock n' roll machine that had welcomed them with open arms all those years ago, instead opting to embrace a more deconstructed approach to performing.<BR> Even moreso than Waters' latest hits tour, Gilmour has unearthed rarely performed gems and obscure covers, and has re-invented overplayed classics. The result is breathtaking. His take on Syd Barrett's seminal Terrapin is pure magic, and Dick Parry's sax solo on Shine On is a freeform revelation. It's this sense of experimentation that has been missing from Gilmour's repetoire since he and the Floyd recorded Dark Side. He's even managed to take his latter-day Floyd tunes into exciting new directions. Take High Hopes for example, what once sounded somewhat inflated and bombastic confined to its awkward Floyd-by-numbers construct, has now taken on a more stripped and organic flavor. Even his lyrics play better without the baggage of the brand name. It's also wonderful to see Richard Wright, playing Breakthrough from his own Broken China album, sounding relaxed and beautiful. <BR> Much of the beauty of the performances is in the rawness of the sound; often times you can hear each finger slide down the fret, each bend of the string. It's a clear and pristine recordingto be sure, but it's not sterile and perfect, it's live, alive. Listening to the 5.1 surround, you could swear Gilmour is just feet away, acoustic guitar slung over his shoulder, entertaining guests at an intimate gathering. <BR> The bonus features are equally rewarding. Gilmour's cover of \\"Don't\\", the Leiber and Stoller song made classic by Elvis Presley, is heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and his rendering of Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, with Michael Kamen, is sublime. <BR> I was quite frankly shocked at how much I enjoyed this DVD. I've already played it more times than I've played Waters' excellent In The Flesh Live. I'd nearly forgotten how definitive Gilmour's guitar sound is, and how much I missed his voice. It's truly the sound of a wisened man with nothing to prove, a man no longer haunted by the ghost of Roger Waters. If this release is any indication of things to come, I will be waiting with just as much anticipation for Gilmour's next solo album as I am for Roger's, and praying for old friends to make amends.
0553573403|5.0|Rather than call this a fantasy book for adults I would like to think of this as a fantasy book for people who think.  There is a difference.<br />I read with some surprise some of the more critical reviews of A Game of Thrones there were complaints of graphic sex scenes and gratuitous violence.  I couldnt find any graphic sex scenes.  Sex was presented but it was not graphic or gratuitous, I thought it was a little refreshing; far too many fantasy books avoid sex like the plague.  I also found far less violence in this book than in most other fantasy novels where anything that is inhuman or ugly is hacked apart with massive swords by the beautiful people.<br />The book is about politics, which sounds horrifically boring but is presented in such a way as to make the intricacies of court and the multitude of players become vivid and real.  A Game of Thrones tells an epic tale of honor and treachery, love and vengeful hatred, intrigue and heroism set in a world where summers and winters can last for years, even lifetimes.  The main story line involves Eddard Stark, lord of Winterfell, and his investigation into the death of another noble.  Along the way there are dozens of interwoven plots, subplots and fascinating characters.<br />This is not a book about conflict between the elemental forces of good and evil.  Rather than a drab world of black and white  Mr. Martin has opted for a more realistic world of grays and innumerable colors.  Rather than having simplified reasoning for actions the characters all have understandable motives or at least understandable rationalizations for their actions.  This is a feature lacking in 95% of other fiction I have read.<br />A Game of Thrones is filled with interesting, fully fleshed out characters.  I searched in vane for cardboard or clich&eacute;d characters and every time I thought I found one I was proven wrong as these characters developed and grew in front of my eyes.<br />Attention to detail in creating the Kingdom of Westeros is remarkable. Westeros is a large island off the coast of the main continent (Think the British Isles) that was at one time divided into seven separate kingdoms but in present day is united under the banner of a single King.  These individual domains all have their particular customs, traditions and ruling classes.  The history of this land is presented with great care, one never feels lectured at or bored with background detail provided.<br />Magic is happily kept to a minimum.  This is a book about people and politics and intrigue, not about wizards tossing around bolts of lightning.  The minimal placement of magic and fantastic beings in the book serves to make their appearance all the more interesting and also serves to carry the story forward rather than solve all the characters problems with a wave of the hand.<br />I have the second and third installments of the series and am looking forward to the fourth book, reportedly due out in 2003ting the Kingdom of Westeros is remarkable.

078401213X|5.0|An outstanding film but when will someone think of releasing the soundtrack? I cant find it anywhere but maybe you will find it for me Amazon.com! <br />I have just bought the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack and I'm in awe! I NEVER usually buy soundtracks, and the only other one i own is Judgement Night with many collaborations between Grunge and Hip-hop bands, including Sonic Youth & Cypress Hill. Highly recommended!<br />Please release the Pi soundtrack!!!!
B0000027RL|3.0|From sharing an office with two alternative rock n roll fans, I became intrigued with this Pearl Jam record. Upon listening to the disc closer, I realized that the music is more than just alternative. There is a creative imagery in the lyrics and vocals of Eddie Veder as well as some noteworthy touches by the other band members.<br />As songs go, Alive and Black are undoubtedly excellent. Alive features a captivating hook and a riveting guitar solo at the end. Black is an example of the more tender side of the band as the lyrics of a missed opportunity are oh so poignant. The keyboards add a special touch.<br />Jeremy, Even Flow, Release and Oceans are good songs as well.  The hooks are quite captivating and Veders vocals do soar. The other tracks are certainly listenable but just not very distinguishable.<br />Overall this is a good recording. The tone is a little monotonous and Eddie Veder's vocals with all his passion can be a bit grating and somber. Don't get me wrong these guys are talented. However, the style could use a few more dimensions. But alternative fans should seek this recording out for sure.
B00006M183|1.0|Self-importance is no longer the premium it once was in the music world...PJ is no longer vital, if they ever were.  Once their mediocrity filled a void...now it's just the void itself.  It's sad because they're true believers.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Listen up people! This is by far the best debut album of the year! Perhaps even the one at the top in the decade. Its called \\"Turn On The Bright Lights,\\" by the fantastic band Interpol. <br />Honestly, they are absolutely amazing. Every song is mind blowing, the well-written lyrics and music; I can't say enough good things about them. I got to catch a live show and the performance too was incredible. They have a great stage presence as well as the foursome coming decked out in suits and ties. All four are absolutely gorgeous, so it's difficult to choose just one to daydream about. <br />Interpol is from New York and they are Paul Banks on vocals and guitar, Daniel Kessler on guitar and background vocals, Carlos D. on bass guitar, keyboards and background vocals and then we got the last sex symbol is Samuel Fogarino on drums. <br />The story goes is that Daniel and Carlos first got together in New York and then Daniel met up with Paul in Paris. Maybe hanging out in Paris is why they got that full European feel. Or maybe that Paul was born in England. Who knows, but they are the best thing since Morrissey and the Europeans are all ecstatic about the new album too!<br />Off the, \\"Turn On The Bright Lights,\\" album is the first track, \\"Untitled,\\" that is short and the sweetest thing you'll ever hear. The complete and accomplished lyrics goes as followed, \\"I will surprise you sometime, I'll come around, when you're down.\\" This song is truly breathtaking and no doubt you will be humming and singing the lyrics for days on end. Truly a two-minute endeavor that can't but hold top preference of all the songs. This superb song only leads to more really exquisite, fresh, endless, ethereal ear candy. <br />Second track, \\"Obstacle One,\\" is fantastic and another favorite. The guitar starts the song off and immediate lyrics follow of a girl putting weights on a heart. \\"NYC,\\" is the third track with Paul singing, \\"Subway is a porno, pavements they are a mess. Know you've supported mefor a long time, some how I'm not impressed,\\" and with Daniel and Carlos singing the background lyrics, \\"got to be some more change in my life.\\" Even though the song is about New York City, the tune is just so good you can't help to love it besides the point and plus it feels a song all people can relate too. \\"PDA,\\" is the fourth track and you can get a good taste of Interpol.P>Check it out and BUY the album since it's a certainty you will fall in love with the stellar band, Interpol and this new album, \\"Turn On the Bright Lights.\\"

B0000524CY|2.0|I was surprised when Warner Bros. actually re-released this movie. I 'd already seen it, but thought I would see it again to find out what was so different. Big deal, there we're a few different scenes in the movie that the original did not have. This should tell you how outdated this movie is-when I saw it in the theater, There we're only two other people In there with me. In my opinion, Warner Bros. should have thought twice before re-releasing this one, cause It obviously didn't make any money, the second time around. If you have never seen this movie, it will probably scare you. If you have seen this movie already, don't bother seeing it again.
B00005YW4H|3.0|This music is as pretty as the picture on the CD cover. Norah Jones has a smooth, evocative voice, and the instrumentation, recording, and mixing are all very professionally done.<br />If you're a jazz fan, you may find more pleasure listening to Ella Fitzgerald, Betty Carter, Shirley Horn, Cassandra Wilson, Carmen McRae, Sheila Jordan, Billie Holliday, Abbey Lincoln, or Sarah Vaughan (as I do). Ms. Jones certainly is not anywhere the level of any of those great artists, but her music is a pleasant way to pass some time.<br />Norah's music is a mixture of country, blues, and torch song. She's a very minimal piano player (although her playing is an effective accompaniment for her voice), she doesn't improvise with her piano or voice (unless you consider simple embellishments to be improvisation), and the solos by her sidemen are *extremely* tame and predictable. Even the presence of Bill Frisell and Brian Blade does nothing to propel it into the jazz idiom. In other words, it's a pop album. Nothing wrong with that; just don't pretend it's jazz, please. It's closer to alt-country. No wonder it's selling like hotcakes.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I'm glad to see that a complete collection of Elton John is finally put out.  However, it does miss a few essential tracks.  It does not have &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Mama Can't Buy You Love&quot;, or &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, which many would argue that are important EJ tracks.<br />  Another couple of disappointing things about this collection is that &quot;Saturday Nights Alright for Fighting&quot; fades out nearly a minute early, and &quot;Daniel&quot; sort of fades as it ends which makes the start of &quot;Saturday Night...&quot; a little more harsh following it.  &quot;Sorry Seems To be the Hardest Word&quot; ends Disc One and &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&quot; starts Disc Two.  This is kind of annoying, since these two tracks would be better reversed in the collection.  And chronologically, it should be. Remember, the first disc covers EJ's first and strongest 6 years of his era, and the second disc covers his last 26 years.  I like to shuffle my discs when I listen to them, so having &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&quot; and &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot; really sounds out of place on each disc.<br />  On the second disc, &quot;I Don't wanna Go On With You Like That&quot; is out of place if you consider that these tracks are supposed to be in chronological order.  However, when you consider the intensity of its upbeat sound, it would sound kind of out of place if it were placed between &quot;Nikita&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot;.  So, I can understand why they did this.<br />  Of course, Elton John does have alot more hits (many Top 20) that have not been put in this collection, but, this collection is pretty tight for all the great songs that are here.  I don't know how high the last three tracks charted, I hope they were big hits so that the other EJ hits that were left off is justified.  The third bonus disc is kind of unecessary.  Although they could have put some more of his lower charting tracks on it.<br />  I'm not too crazy about the packaging, since this is not a standard jewel box that is usually used.  These cardboard dig-paks get tethered and worn too quickly.<br />  But, for the most part.  This is a collection worth owning, even if you have all his seventies albums on CD.  The second disc really is a bargain for Elton John fans who have his first 6 years covered.it.  <BR>   I'm not too crazy about the packaging, since this is not a standard jewel box that is usually used.

0553812173|5.0|Erikson's Gardens of the Moon, is, in short, one of the best epic fantasy novels I have ever read. The plot is excellent, very well thought out,and oddly enough, original to the core. This book is a masterful mix of intrigue, magic, and what seems to me to be a rarity, a departure from Tolkieneske standards.<br />Overall, I just cannot recomend this book enough, it is well writen, the plethora of characters will astound you with their uniqueness and each page will have you wanting more.

0140288503|4.0|I read the book by Mark Bowden Black Hawk Down.  This book was so good that it became a major motion film.  On a scale from one to ten, I would give this book a nine.  It had everything you could want in a war story, action, drama, and killing.  The story setting is Mogadishu.  The U.S. army is there to kick out the terrorist that is running the country.  The book is about one of their missions that went horribly wrong.  The soldiers thought it would be a routine mission that would take 30 minutes, but as soon as they fly into the city they get a bad feeling.  First they drop a man from the helicopter and then RPG's shoots down two Black Hawk's.  Then the convoy that was suppose to take them out of the city got lost, leaving the soldiers stranded in the city all night long.    Bowden catches the attention of the reader right from the beginning and never lets go.  As you are reading the book, it feels like you are there.  He gives you a vivid description of the surrounding and all the action that is occurring.  An example of this is, \\"The little convoy sped out to the main road and for a stretch of firing abated and in the distance was the ocean.  But as they approached the port area, there were thousands of Somalis in the streets.\\" (Bowden 56)  He also describes the action scenes with great description.  \\"When the first group of four dashed out into the night, the whole neighborhood erupted.  It sounded like the city of Mogadishu had sprung viciously back to life.\\" (Bowden 240)  This is an example of his description in the action scenes.  The authors descriptive detail makes the reader want to keep reading.  If you liked We were Soldiers Once... and Young or Band of Brothers you will like this book.  I also recommend that once you finish reading the book, go see the movie if you haven't already.
B00005JL96|5.0|I took my 5 year old son to see this movie during the summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, more than he did. I can't wait for 12/3 when the video/dvd comes out.    It was wonderful. I would highly reccomend it.
B00006M183|5.0|I borrowed my friend's album and after listening to it i must say Pearl Jam is really good.

B00005JKCH|5.0|I was a Spiderman fan when I was little but grew away from it and became a Superman fan/collector. However, watching this movie brought it all back. I thought the movie was packed with some real good action and adventure. Good plot and it stuck to the comics. This movie definately kept my attention, especially in the end when Spidey got hammered by the Goblin. I highly recommend this.
B00005NWM3|1.0|It doesn't take a genius to realize that Nickelback are unoriginal, derivative and simplistic. So why all the 5 star reviews? I think that most of the people who have written reviews for this album buy about 3 cd's per year, or they are just kids who blindly go out and buy every peice of trash rock anthem they see on MTV. \\"How you Remind me\\" is a likeable peice of pop rock, but you can't honestly say that this whole album is as good as that song. Every other track sounds like they have taken one song and rearranged it 10 different ways to fill up the rest of the cd. The lyrics are simplistic and blatant. Chad Kroeger trys so hard to sound morally upstanding yet at the same time so down and defeated. Its pathetic. Get some soul and some creativity.

0060090367|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Marian Keyes but it certainly won't be the last! It was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. The story is told from the point of view of Claire, a woman dealing with the birth of her first child as well as her husband leaving her. It doesn't sound like suject matter for a hilarious novel - but Marian Keyes manages to keep readers in stiches with Claire's witty commentary on the events going on in her life. I highly recommend Watermelon.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|A lot has been written about Ryan Adams of late, both good and bad.  But whatever you think of his rowdy (perhaps obnoxious) lifestyle, his split from Whiskeytown, his high-profile friendship with Elton John, his self-aggrandizement, his dubious choices to release in one way or another everything he has ever recorded (Demolition), he is still a phenominal talent.<br />No songwriter today succeeds at bending genres, being literate, and being catchy as well as Ryan Adams.  \\"GOLD\\" is nothing if not compulsively listenable.  Think of it as the sonic equivalent of a page-turner -- every song is dynamite, different from the previous track but just as exciting.  The soft songs are gentle and loving, the rave-ups are toe-tapping and hard-charging.  Some songs are better than others, certainly, but all are GOOD.  This is an album you have to listen to all the way through, no skipping tracks, no stopping halfway through.<br />The variety of styles on this album, the nuanced and skilled songwriting, the gutsy, heartrending vocal performances -- all add up to a great album.<br />The lack of focus that the Amazon.com reviewer criticizes -- \\"indistinct\\" and \\"plodding\\" are two words that stuck out -- seems to be intentional, and hardly a fault at all.  Too many bands and artists are willing to make the same song or same type of song over and over again.  Even great artists like REM, U2, and the aforementioned Elton John all get stuck repeating themselves.  Not to say that Ryan Adams will never repeat himself, or that each and every song he writes will forever be like night and day to each another.  But on this album at least, Adams finds himself intentionally firing off great songs of all types in many different directions.  That's part of what makes it so musically interesting.  I don't happen to think that the album plods, or that he isn't able to rock (Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues rocks well enough for my liking).  Instead, I think he has made a well rounded, expansive, unconstrained record as much full of rowdy fun as it is of gentle poetics.<br />Will Ryan Adams get better?  Will he self destruct?  Will he burn out?  Will he and Elton John keep in touch?  Who knows.  Who cares.  This is a great album for the here-and-now, and beyond.  It's just a great listen, nada mas.
B00005JM09|3.0|When it was announced that James Cameron would not direct TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, fans and critics said \\"Hasta La Vista\\" to the film's success, both critically and commercially. Not having Cameron's visceral trademark M.O (Blow up everything) for the continuation of the series is criminal. But that's Hollywood for you. Now with Cameron only producing, Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U571) is set to helm this monster of a movie. With both star and budget problems and no Linda Hamilton, this could kill the franchise. Oh sure, it'll be impressive to see what it'll look like and Arnie's fans will no doubt get excited about the Austrian hulk's return to the series after a long string of action clunkers. New cast members include Kristanna Loken as the female terminator and Claire Danes. It's all speculation, but Cameron replaced by a shaky B-movie director, we can only hope that this will be a success that will terminate box office records and revive Schwarzenegger's career as one of the greatest action guys in movie history. And regardless of the film's problems, millions of hard-core fans are eagerly waiting for it's theatrical release in July 2 2003.
0679411585|5.0|I was 15 at the time this action took place.We were told that we were fighting for democracy in South Vietnam.As it turns out that was an ideal that only the men that brought the war to the NVA really embraced.Like most young boys of my generation we were brought up on such films as Iwo Jima,Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,The Flying Tigers ect. ect.It seemed to be the right of passage that each generation was defined by the conflict that they fought in. In a way I couldn't wait to take my turn.Through this book and many others somewhat like it the courage and heroism shown by many of those sent to Vietnam many of them exactly my age in 68 when things really went from bad to disgraceful the year I  registered for the draft.The reports I was getting from friends and others just back from thier own private hell in Vietnam somewhat dimmed my enthusiasum for fufilling my right of passage and passing on college and signing up and shouldering a rifle and standing a post.One only needs to read the Lost Battalion by Charles A. Krohn to see that by 68 things were headed,if you can exuse the expresson,south and at twice double time.The first time I read this book I found myself daydreaming that if there was a time an place I would have liked to put my... on the line it would have been with Col. Moore and his men.I know thats patently absurd who in there right mind would ever say that if they had to hop into a meatgrinder a particular one was much more suitable than another.Remember I was brought up on Audie Murphy and John Wayne they never died or made it look damn good when they did.What this book pounded into my thick scull was that there is no glory in war.Only death gore and the memories of the friends that were killed and the manner of thier death for the ones who survived.I know this doesn't make much sense.Yet does taking a helo ride into hell sound like sound advice? What I don't get when the 2nd Battalion renforced the 1st on the third day and had the NVA in full retreat why in the hell didn't they go an finish the job.And whoever ordered those men to march to LZ Albany I would imagine that the spirit of those troopers slaughtered there haunted him the rest of his life.Or at least I hoped they did my god what a trajedy.I am more than humbled by the narative and the stone cold way it is dilivered.God bless those 79 men who never made it home.I echo many who have written here this should be mandatory reading for high school civics students.
B000005GWE|4.0|Another solid collection of energetic jazz from Pat &amp; SEVT (Somebody Else Very Talented).  I don't intend to denigrate JS, because I don't know his music.  I just know that when Pat gets together with another whiz for a studio recording session, the results are usually great.  This CD has a lot of similarities to other CDs that Pat's done with SEVT, but the flavor of this one is more electric, upbeat, and dynamic than others. <br />I believe that I own every release that Pat's ever done with anyone else, solo, or PMG.  I even have the one with Joni Mitchell.  It's the fattest and most cherished part of my music collection!  This CD is a solid addition.  I can't believe that I just discovered it this year.  It's been out since 1994.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones has certainly made a spash with her debut, and a well-deserved splash at that.<br />I must echo what has been said before about this album, however -- as promising as it is and enjoyable as it is in its own right -- it's also very much outshined by some of the other &quot;retro&quot; songstresses that have come to prominance in recent months.  In particular, Diana Krall both sings and plays circles around Jones, and I prefer Jane Monheit's new album as well, to say nothing of the work Natalie Cole has done in recent years.<br />When Jones is best, however, is when she breaks away from the Billie Holiday-style sultry standards and takes on new tunes (the catchy Don't Know Why) or re-reads classics of another genre (Hank Williams' Cold Cold Heart).  In fact, I think she would do well to focus more on offbeat song choices and further explore her gentle, almost-country leanings.  With a bit more adventurousness, pizzaz, and soul, Jones could differentiate herself from the Kralls and Monheits of the music world and carve an exciting niche for herself.<br />Instead of modeling herself on Billie Holliday, Krall, or others in fact, I hope she instead looks to the criminally overlooked Madeline Peyroux, whose one amazing album &quot;Dreamland&quot; all but slipped under the radar.  Check out Peyroux's &quot;Dreamland,&quot; a much funkier, fun, ragged album than the borderline over-produced &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot;  Since Peyroux has completely disappeared as far as I know, I hope Norah Jones decides to take a page from Peyroux's book and takes a different tack from the other contenporary standard-bearers.  Krall plays circles around her, Monheit has more soul, Cole has the bloodlines.  Norah Jones should make herself something different altogether.  If she manages this on her follow-up album (always tricky to overcome the sophmore jinx), count me as the first in line to check her out.
B0000648WZ|1.0|&quot;Lust in space&quot; may have been a better title for this awful movie based on the book by Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein would cringe if he saw this lust story.  Because, thats what is it when you get right down to it: a lust story. There's a catfight between the two women in Johnny Rico's life (although the two girls don't fight each other in the physical sense). One girl wants to get laid by Rico before the other girl does. UGH!
0312932081|5.0|On Ender's Game from a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) I give it a 9.  Orison Scott Card wrote a terrific book about another world in which bugs from another planet try to invade earth.  To stop them, the bugs, Earth's defense has to recruit young boys.  Train them in war tactics, teach them how to be leaders, and school them as well.  In the beginning of the book you read and get lost of who is who.  The main character is a boy name Ender; his real name is Andrew Wiggin.  Orison wrote Ender's name as Andrew in the beginning but doesn't tells us that he was Ender later on.  That's the only confusion I found in the book other wise Ender's Game is a fun and adventurous book that you won't be able to put down.  The book leaves you on the edge of your seat every time you turn the page. If you like books that are about outer space and the Star Wars series like then this is the book I would recommend for you.  It has romance, action, and betrayal all the things to make a book irresistible and unpredictable.  Orison Scott Card made the book fun to read for ages 10 and up.  He won the Nebula and the Hugo awards for Ender's Game, if you like this book then you should try out the other books in the Ender's Game series.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I have had the opportunity to hear AKUS live on four different occassions and have come away every time thinking that they needed to find a way to bottle the raw emotion and energy that they display on-stage.<br />This is the closest you will ever get to bottled Alison.  All of the cuts on this album are excellent.  It was recorded on a 34 track SACD system that successfully caught every little breath of the singers and every little squeak of fingers fretting instruments.<br />While the album is heavily peppered with songs from New Favorite, she reaches as far back to her 1995 release, Every Time You Say Goodbye for material.  My favorite, however, has to be &quot;But You Know I Love You&quot;, which was performed at varying times by Kenny Rogers (you know who he is) and Don Williams (if you don't know who he is, shame on you).  While a fan of both gentlemen, the emotional depth she brings to this song is astounding and is now my favorite version.  The album perfectly captured the calm that settles over a crowd when she sings &quot;Ghost in this House&quot; (to hear the original version of the song, still my favorite, check out the now-defunct country group Shenandoah).<br />One song that I would have liked to have heard was &quot;Teardrops Will Kiss the Morning Dew&quot; (from her I've Got That Old Feeling release), which she does an excellent job of delivering live.<br />Overall, this is one of the best live albums I have ever heard and faithfully represents AKUS's artistry.  If you are looking for a first exposure to AKUS, this may not be a bad place to start.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I saw this movie when It first came out 20 some years ago.<br />I just got the dvd verison for my 4 year old daughter and you know what?? she sat still for the whole 2+ hours of this movie. just goes to show that an oldie Is still a goodie.

B000001E7L|5.0|It was the video to \\"Zombie\\" that first made me notice The Cranberries. At first I didn't care for the song, but as it grew on me, I began to be pulled into the emotion and story behind the song. Finally I paid attention in detail, and I was hooked. While The Cranberries first album was full of love and angst, this album is a bit darker and about violence.<br />The first song, \\"Ode to My Family\\", is very much in the style of the songs from \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\\" Still full of angst, but this time about her feelings about her family. The sentiment is positive, but the tone of the song feels grunge.<br />\\"I Can't Be with You\\" has a faster pace, and harkens back to the angst-filled love and relationship songs of their previous CD. The tone of the song is ironic, because it sounds as though it wants to be happy, but is a song of separation and frustrated love.<br />The next song has simple lyrics, and I am unsure of the subject matter. \\"21\\" may be about turning 21 and being on your own, and being able to do what you want to do. The song is mellow with Dolores' beautiful voice.<br />The outstanding song \\"Zombie\\" follows. Containing grunge elements, this song has a heavy beat that crescendos with the chorus, punctuating the anger regarding the \\"Troubles\\" in Ireland. The mental images and the video are graphic and sobering, visual art successfully marrying musical art. A beautifully performed song that is political and sad and angry and despairing all at once. Stop the violence she says.<br />The next song is another angst-filled song. \\"Empty\\" could apply to a lot of situations, but given The Cranberries penchant for relationship songs, my guess is that it is about someone who either didn't notice someone who wanted to be noticed, or didn't get the relationship they wanted, leaving the singer \\"Empty\\".<br />\\"Everything I Said\\" is another relationship song. Slow and sad, touching. Trying to reach out to someone who just isn't paying attention.<br />I sometimes find it emotionally difficult to listen to \\"The Icicle Melts\\", because the subject is about the death of a child, and the sadness of the mother. It is difficult for a man or a woman who has not carried a child for nine months to understand the special bond that exists between the child and its mother. It is sad when any child dies, but for the mother it will always be worse. This song is very serious, and incredibly sad. You must be in the right kind of mood for this one.<br />\\"Disappointment\\" is about ending a relationship for a serious error on his part. While these songs seem like one sad song after another, they are so beautiful and mellow that sometimes they just really fit my mood. \\"Ridiculous Thoughts\\" is another song along the same lines. \\"Dreaming My Dreams\\" could have been happy, but the song is about a glass half empty instead of half full, very slow, very mellow, and very full of bass.<br />\\"Yeat's Grave\\" has a little quicker beat. I must admit that the subject matter of this one is beyond me. I suspect that it relates to Irish history or folklore, of which I have only marginal knowledge. It is very pretty though.<br />As you might have suspected, \\"Daffodil Lament\\" is another relationship song, about her thoughts of breaking up and not being able to stay with him. Dolores gets to exercise the full range of her voice on this, punctuating the song sharply in several places.<br />The last song, \\"No Need to Argue\\", is a kind of coda. The reason there's no need to argue is because the relationship is over. The song starts with an organ sound, very very slow. This song would seem to tie all the relationship songs on this CD together to form a vague concept. If you assume that songs like \\"Zombie\\" and \\"Yeat's Grave\\" form a background to the relationship, then perhaps this is a concept album, the story of the trials and tribulations of a relationship that ends with the last song.<br />Musically, lyrically and vocally beautiful, this CD is a bit more polished than \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\\" If you like mellow music, especially like Enya or Lorena McKinnitt, you might find this CD to your taste. Just be prepared for the angst.ished than \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\\" If you like mellow music, especially like Enya or Lorena McKinnitt, you might find this CD to your taste. Just be prepared for the angst.

B00006V9A0|1.0|The new single is good.  It's really good.  But this disc is awful.  If all you want are the radio hits, fine, but that's not Nirvana.  Besides, you could buy only 3 Nirvana albums and that would cover all their radio singles anyway...  I was hoping for some new music.  Geffen should not have put this out.  It's not cool that bands like Sublime and Nirvana are still putting out music...  Think about it.  Save your money.
B000067CPX|5.0|The songs on this album display a mastery of a variety of genres. I enjoyed the first two songs immediately. The remaining songs grew on me, quickly. The Peppers will take you on journey, from the sentimental to the knowingly smug, that you may never have been on before. This is a wonderful album. Great to work out to, great to listen to while you're reading, great to work around the house to. Better than Californication, a nearly impossible feat.
0060523794|5.0|i'm currently reading &quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?&quot; by lou gerstner...<br />so far it's an excellent and insightful read, especially from the standpoint of someone who's worked w/ and competed against ibm for the last two decades...<br />having been a customer, a var, a fierce competitor (dell online) and a partner (numerous times both w/ the old and new ibm) i can comfortably state that they are much better today then they've ever been, and from an i.t. perspective they are strategically a very safe bet to partner w/ as a customer today then they ever have been...<br />their strategy regarding web services (walking the line between j2ee and .net) is brilliant and their turnaround, technological improvement and marketing campaign regarding webshere vs. bea is amazing, especially considering that webshere in the early days of the web was a complete and utter waste of time...<br />reading lou's &quot;story&quot; regarding the last decade is very entertaining as well as educational for anyone interested in the i.t. and computer industries...
0446677450|5.0|This book is an excelent tool for opening a whole new world up to people who were told to &quot;Go to school and get good grades, so you can get a high paying job.&quot; This book doesn't contain every grain of knowledge that is required to find your path in life, and you path to richness, but it does allow you to see that such a path exists and that it may not be the path that your parents took or the one that they encourage you to take.  If this book affects you as it did me, you uncover an inner desire to be more than you are and energize you on your path to becoming more.  I have bought and read books non-stop since reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad, about investing in traditional investments and investing in myself. This book has definately had and will continue to have a positive inpact on my life.
B00005JKZ2|5.0|A great movie! Despite what some may say, MIIB is not a rehash of the original film. It is new, fresh, and very clever! MIIB is a jam packed movie starring Will Smith as Alien fighting, fast talking Agent Jay, and Tommy Lee Jones as Jay's strict and serious partner, Kay. The men are back...in black this time to save the world from the evil Serleena, an alien that takes the form of a Victoria's Secret model. Serleena vows to capture \\"The Light\\", a very powerful force that could destroy the entire world unless it leaves Earth by midnight! Jay, Kay, Frank the Pug, the Worm Guys, and Laura, a new love interest of Jay who witnessed an alien crime, set out to save Earth and to destroy Serleena. <br />The weapons are cool, the gadgets are cool, the background music by Danny Elfman is cool, and just the overall style of the film itself is very cool. Trust me, this is one of the greatest and most hilarious films ever made!
B00000ILBK|3.0|Ok, upon watching Star Trek: Insurrection in theaters back in early '99 I thought it was a pretty good entry in the Star Trek franchise but when I bought the DVD I realized after multiple viewings that it had major flaws. First of all I think the producers tried a little to hard at being funny and humorous. Yes, Data, Picard and Worf singing Gilbert & Sullivan was quite entertaining, Troi and Dr. Crusher admiring how their... are firming up and Picard wearing a newly allied alien's headpiece was near side-splitting but just about everything else isn't to good. The plot about the eternal fountain of Youth and the Baku and Sona was interesting but would have probably been better suited as a TNG episode. The Special FX were good and I just love the part where the Enterprise is pursued by the Sona and Riker uses a \\"joystick\\" to pilot the Enterprise and blows away the Sona ships by clever means. Ruofo wasn't to bad as the main villian and the Admiral was a wuss who could be manipulated easily. It would have been nice though if there was some continuity from \\"First Contact\\". In the end, they time-travel back to the 24th century and in Insurrection it seems nothing at all changed and everything is spic and span. What's the deal?! Oh well, Star Trek: Insurrection is still a reasonably good movie worth renting or possibly buying if you're a Trekkie or Trekker. Star Trek: Nemesis will kick... Peace out.
0790729393|5.0|Rare is a movie that completely holds your attention for 2 1/2 hours but Sleepers is that movie.  Played out by an exceptional ensemble cast (Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Renfro), it tells the tale of four young Hell's Kitchen boys who after pulling a seamingly harmless prank, are sent to a juvenile facility where they face unspeakable horrors at the hands of ther wardens.  This trauma follows 2 of the boys into adulthood where they enter a life of crime. When they take their revenge on a particularly sadistic guard, it's up to the other boys, along with a childhood gal pal and a loving priest to save them. Every performance in this movie makes an indelible impression but the standouts are Deniro as Father Bobby, Frank Medrano as neighborhhod shopowner Fatman, Minnie Driver as Carol and Geoffrey Wigdor as young John.  I watch this movie every November(it feels like a Fall time movie) and it never fails to amaze me.  It is tense, heartwrenching, touching and at times funny.  However the final 5 minutes always hit me where it hurts.  When I think of how those kids were robbed of a normal life it sickens me.  Sleepers is a phenomenal film that will leave a deep impression.
B00006M183|4.0|After hearing the band play &quot;I Am Mine&quot; and &quot;Last Soldier&quot; at the Bridge last year, and Eddie playing &quot;Can't Keep&quot; and &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; I'll admit I was a bit skeptical about the next album.  I was excited, but afraid that the band was drifting into the REM phase of their career - an all acoustic, mandolin and ukelele album - but I couldn't have been more wrong.  Riot Act is just that.  Led by the single &quot;I Am Mine&quot; which is without a doubt the strongest single Pearl Jam has released and truly shows Eddie's arrival as the song writing center of the band.  The power packed threesome of &quot;Save You&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot;, and &quot;Crop Duster&quot; throttle into the single and &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; which is one of the sadest most beautiful songs Pearl Jam has ever recorded, it has the overplayed &quot;Betterman&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; beat by a mile.  The second half of the album is overall the most experimental the band has been on a single album, &quot;You Are&quot;, &quot;Bushleaguer&quot;, and &quot;Help, Help&quot; and &quot;Half Full&quot; are more cohesive and realized versions of what &quot;Bugs&quot; had alluded to.<br />One of the strongest, most focused albums in their catalog thus far.  Overall, the lyrics are a bit weak on some of the songs, but this is a minor issue.  The addition of Boom on keyboards adds a great boost and dimension to most songs, especially &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; the tribute to the Rosklide victims.  Mike's solos are firey and fierce delivering an additional punch to most songs.  Riot Act is a natural progression for a great rock band.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I recommend this album to anyone who loves music. Incubus is a great band both live and on record. All five members are excellent in their instrument manipulation and music writing, especially Brandon since he is one of the few frontmen in mainstream rock who can actually sing (another would be Lajon Witherspoon of Sevendust). One thing that really amazes me about this album is the excellence in production quality. Keep in mind that they did not record this album in a premier acoustically designed environment such as a recording studio but in a beautiful Malibu mansion which is obviously not designed for recording music. I've only been an Incubus fanatic for about a year. I heard &quot;Pardon Me&quot; on the radio, I got hooked and it's been one of my favorite songs of all time. I still wish that Incubus can still do a lot more heavier material like the ones heard on  SCIENCE and Make Yourself, but with Morning View they are doing something different and new, which is a breath of fresh air to the mainstream.
1558807381|3.0|i couldnt decide if this movie was just plain bad or just horrably hilarious. I mean the Lord of darkness holding his \\"Horn\\"...that was just, just....funnier then [anything].Every secene seemed to have, on some level, a reference to sex. No this is no movie for the kiddies.... but excellent if your bored out of your mind and need a good humorous movie!
B00006YXE4|5.0|I've gotta give this CD a five star rating, because I've always loved Clapton, not to mention I went to the concert when he was doing this tour, and it was amazing.  &quot;River of Tears&quot; is one the highlights of the entire thing, it's very very good.  It's true, he is mellowing out nowadays, and &quot;Layla&quot; is a little more mellow compared to the original, but hey, it's &quot;Layla,&quot; who cares, if you're a Clapton fan.  I highly recommend this CD and DVD, it was a very awesome concert.
B00006IR5S|5.0|I bought the soundtrack the day it came out. I was expecting something pretty good but instead I got...amazing! I love this soundtrack! It is a lot darker than the first and has more character themes. My favorite tracks are &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix,&quot; &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart,&quot; and &quot;Dueling the Basilisk.&quot; I would recommend this CD to anyone who asked!
B00003CX9Q|4.0|Universal did a good job on the E.T. DVD release.  The film doesn't need too much in-depth exploration since the whole movie's believability rests on your willing disbelief that E.T. is actually an alien from outer space.  I must admit that some of the behind-the-scenes clips showing little people in the E.T. suit are a bit shocking!  I know he's only a special effect, but seeing those scenes is a bit like learning the truth about Santa Clause -- I suggest *not* viewing the behind-the-scenes featurettes until *after* you watch the movie (if this is your first E.T. experience).<br />The digital makeover was probably needed and doesn't bother me that much.  For those who are purists, Universal has included the original 1982 version of the film.  I think Spielberg went a bit too far when he digitally removed the guns -- I can understand why he made the decision though.<br />I really enjoyed the preproduction designs of E.T. and his spaceship.  It is very nice to see the Ralph McQuarrie (of STAR WARS fame) spaceship designs.<br />The Harrison Ford scene (cut from the film ... he played Elliot's principal) is still missing, however there are some black and white stills from the scene -- Elliot's chair levitated, apparantly.  Hmmmm.  Interesting.<br />E.T. is a classic film.  The new DVD set (in attractive packaging) is nice to add to my collection.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I find it helps to know what type of fan a reviewer is when I'm reading their <BR>review.  So... I own all of EJ's albums on CD (including the horrible &quot;Victim <BR>Of Love&quot;).  I've been listening to his music since my parents had &quot;Madman <BR>Across The Water&quot; on 8-track.  Even as a huge fan and completist, it's hard <BR>to argue with any of the songs on this 2 CD collection.  These ARE his biggest<BR>hits.  And the remastering is great (as good if not better than the full album<BR>remasters).<br />Disc 1 covers EJ's amazing early years 1970 to 1976.  It is a perfect one disc<BR>version of his original Greatest Hits albums (Vol 1 and 2) with only 4 tracks <BR>missing (1 of these tracks is on Disc 2).  The only flaw I can find is the <BR>edited version of &quot;Saturday Night's Alright&quot; (it's 50 seconds shorter).<br />Disc 2 covers the rest, 1976 to 2002.  This period easily could have been <BR>expanded into 2 discs.  A three disc compilation of EJ would have been perfect.<BR>Disc 2 does contain his biggest hits but I miss songs like &quot;Who Wears These <BR>Shoes&quot;, &quot;Healing Hands&quot; and my favorite 80's song, &quot;Empty Garden&quot;.  Including <BR>these songs would have also helped break up the endless stream of slow ballads<BR>that overwhelm Disc 2.  One thing that is still bugging me is that &quot;Nikita&quot; <BR>follows &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot;, which doesn't make sense.<BR>The entire compilation is chronological except for these 2 songs.  And by <BR>inverting the order of these 2 songs, there are actually MORE slow songs in <BR>a row than should have been.  It just confuses me.  Oh well.<br />The bonus disc is nice to have but adds little to the final product.  The only<BR>song that belongs here is the live version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot;, which was <BR>a number 6 hit in 1987.  Wouldn't it have been great if the bonus disc had 3 <BR>other lesser known hits from the period?  Songs like &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad <BR>Hatters&quot;, Burn Down The Mission&quot;, &quot;In Neon&quot; or &quot;Please&quot;.  I really don't <BR>want another copy of George Michael covering an EJ song.<br />But if you could have only 2 CD's of EJ's best, this would be it.  If you do <BR>not own any EJ, buy this.  If your feeling adventurous, buy &quot;Tumbleweed <BR>Connection&quot; and &quot;Madman Across The Water&quot;.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I do have to admit that for a while, I thought POP had sunk U2.  Recent times and re-exploration of the disc has actually brought it up much higher in my assessment of the U2 catalogue.  Pourquoi?<br />1) There is quite a bit of rattle and hum that goes unnoticed when the album is not listened to via headphones.  It is extraordinarily complex.  First three seconds of \\"Mofo\\" - absolute brilliance!<br />2) The more minimalist remixes of \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Gone\\", and \\"Staring at the Sun\\" on the new U2 compilation album show the songs for what they are - REALLY GOOD SONGS.  Stripped of some of the dance beats, the guitar line in \\"Discotheque\\" is perhaps the most exciting moment of mid-90s U2.<br />I think this album deserves a lot of reconsideration.  It is far from perfect, yes.  \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" and \\"Miami\\" are rubbish, yes.  But there are some giddy high points hit by this album.  Different production could have made this a much-less maligned album - it is dark, it is complex, but it is still really good.<br />I would be really interested to hear ALL the album tracks (Miami and the Playboy Mansion included) remixed - could be even better! Still, in some ways it's good that this album proved the dark night of the U2 soul for its having pushed \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" to become what it was.
B000063V8T|5.0|This boxed set represents one of the best collections of one of the best television shows around. The picture and sound quality are phenomenal it's liking watching them for the first time, much better than when originally broadcast. The DVD's are easy to navigate with excellent menu configurations. Anyone who is a fan should experience STTNG the way it should be as presented here.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I think this guy is the best guitarist in this world. The sound of his guitars is incredible. It's a real pleasure : acoustic and electric , the work is perfect.<BR>If you need action and power PULSE is the best concert of all time, but if you prefer feeling and blues , this live is for you.<BR>David if you read this review, you must know that you gave pleasure to millions people around the world since your fisrt album with PINK FLOYD, thank you very much.<BR>Your modesty must be an exemple for all the artists ( and for Roger Waters for sure).<BR>I am a french man and I cried when I listened to your song of Bizet :YOU ARE THE BEST !!!<BR>The sound and video quality of this dvd is EXELLENT. <br />My personal preference is your extra with Mica Paris : for all the professionals of electric blues , I really think that are better than all the other guitarists. I love Clapton, BB King , SRV ... but I have never heard a sound so clean and beautiful...<br />Thanks a lot, David . I hope that you will do ohter concert like this and other dvds.
B00005JKCH|1.0|Although both the packaging and the DVDs themselves are<BR>identified as the widescreen edition, my Pioneer DVD player<BR>only played the fullscreen version; I could not get the<BR>widescreen version to play. The package info does not even<BR>indicate the fullscreen version is on the disc. On a different<BR>brand player, the widescreen version did play.<BR>(So both versions are on the DVD even if the viewer can't<BR>choose between them.) -- I returned the DVDs and did not<BR>get another, assuming any copy would have the same result on<BR> my player.
B00005JKHP|3.0|The 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture Director's Edition' DVD set makes a valiant attempt at restoring the first Trek film to its intended format. In part, it succeeds, due to the evident passion for the movie displayed by director Nicholas Meyer and others who worked on the film. <BR>The &quot;director's cut&quot; seen on this set is a combination of the original theatrical release and the television cut (previously available on VHS for many years) and I feel it works better than both prior versions. However, it's still no classic. <BR>The pace and tone of 'Star Trek: The Slow-Motion Picture' (as I like to call it) are alternately mind-boggling and as dull as watching paint dry, while the dialogue and acting are stiff and uninvolving. Even some of the new additions to this film are off-putting, such as over-the-top digital panoramas on Vulcan that practically scream, &quot;Look at me! I'm making this movie better!&quot; The special effects as a whole are great for the time, although the movie's focus on SFX over plot and character is a fatal flaw.<BR>So, all in all, I'd still rate this one as the next-to-worst of the Trek feature films, with only 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier' coming out worse. It's a blessing for the Star Trek franchise that the film to follow, 'Wrath Of Khan', was so infinitely better in all respects and helped set the groundwork for all the adventures to follow.
0743233832|5.0|This is more than just a translation of Marcus Aurelius' wonderful &quot;Meditations&quot;. It is a recreation of its meaning for the modern reader, true to the original text and to the tenets of Stoic philosophy and yet in a lucid and poetic language that is immensely readable. I have studied the &quot;Meditations&quot; in the original Greek, and I have seen other translations. Scot Hicks' and David Hicks' rendering is undoubtedly the best. It is supported by a commendable graphical production which highlights the most memorable passages. Marcus Aurelius deserves to be read by everyone but especially by those who purport to lead other people.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I got a European version of this DVD and am buying the US version now - it is stunning ! I first saw a teaser video on Apple's QuickTime website and was blown away ! I especially like the Shine On track and the Comfortably Numb (although I wish Bob Geldoff didn't need to read the lyrics:). Check out the teaser - this DVD is awesome !
B00005JKG9|5.0|If you have been lucky enough to have seen this film then you know what I am talking about. If not buy or rent it, trust me, you will not be sorry. One of the greatest screenplays ever made and starring some of the greatest actors of our time. It can't miss! &quot;Sit down, coffee is for closers&quot;
B00006M183|5.0|Ok so your here becuase your wondering wether to buy this album. Or just looking for some opinions.<br />For a first time pearl jam fan this isnt the place to start. FIrst time fans should grab the three best pearl jam albums, no code, ten and yeild. Or even just live on two legs. Also the pittsburg bootleg if you can find it.<br />For long time pearl jam listeners all i can say is this material is superb. Totaly blown away. The album needs time to sink in though, so dont give up after a first listen. TO describe it i'd say it's a mix between vitolagy and binural, so you can gather that it is a very dark album. And onto the songs!<br />1 cant keep - 8/10, good song it's got ed playing the uke and the rest of the band playing a grea beat. Sounds like somethign off no code, reminds me of sometimes or smile.<br />2 save you - 7/10 the big rocker on the cd, fast and edgy and a very catchy riff, good work mike and stone, plus some wicked druming my our man matt cameron.<br />3 Love boat captain - 10/10 , defanatly one of my faves, starts slow and builds up, kinda like given to fly. Lost 9 friends we'll never know, heartfilled lyrics by edd written about the festival gig in 2000 where 9 fans were crushed to death during daughter.<br />4 cropduster -8/10 didnt like this one at first, but it really grew on my, strong vocal chorus. SOrta like a rocking version of light years.<br />5 ghost - 10/10 oh yeah hear we go, this song is great, welcome back solos from mike. Superb rocker. This is defanatly my favourite song on the album.<br />6 i am mine - 8/10 yeah we've all heard this, pretty little song, with a great choris and a short but neat solo at the end. This is the first hit off the album.<br />7 thumbing my way - 7/10 from what i have heard, many people find this song their fave on the album, it's great but it doesnt quite do it for me. It's more like a downscale version of off he goes.<br />8 you are - 9/10 woah!!! Is this really pearl jam? <BR>SOme great riff work by mike, no it's actually it's matt? Yep he fed a guitar through a drum machie and this is the result! SOmething very different for the jam. And quite a jam it is.<br />9 get right - 7/10 another rocker but it's not as good. Catchy chorus with hand clapping!<br />10 green disease - 10/10 great stuff this song, another rocker, great bass line and it's really catchy ones of my defanate faves on the album.<br />11 help help - 6.5/10 one of the worst songs on the album, kinda annoying after a while, good guitar work at the end though, this song is written by jeff ament.<br />12 bushleaguer -9/10 great heavy riffage here. ALthough edd talks most the verses of this song it's still cool. THe chorus reminds me of of the girl, which was the best song on binural.<br />13 1/2 full 6/10 wost song on the album, looks likw they were trying to do another red moskito but failed kinda badly. Although some people seem to really like this song, but i didnt really.<br />14 arc, not really a song just edds vocies. Makes a nice intro to all or none. THis is a great song to piss off your neighbours with, and you can just keep it on repeat!<br />15 all or none 10/10 another favourite on the album, slower and has a piano in which is really nice great end to the album.<br />so a great album a must buy for all pearl jam fans, specially if you werent to keen on binural because this one blows it's socks off!<br />Keep up the great work guys and i'm flying over fro NZ to see you in Brisbane yay!!!!!!
B000002J1M|5.0|Everyone seem to have an opinion in what his or her favourite Genisis CD is , for me its FOXTROT. Why you may ask? well just be patient and I`ll tell you ! This is the CD that shows us just what a great lyricist and voice Peter Gabriel is and it gives us Supper`s Ready and many other classic genesis songs like Get em out by Friday , Watcher of the skies, infact the whole CD is fantastic and so consistant , from the beautiful Horizons by Steve Hackett to the amasing percusion by Phil Collins . get this CD its worth remembering .
0385508417|5.0|&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a charming story filled with characters you would love to have as neighbors, even as you can picture them standing outside the Kranks house singing Christmas carols at all hours...and placing Frosty's on the rooftops!  I have not laughed out loud while reading a book in a long time, as I did while reading this novel.  As others have said, and I agree, this could easily be made into a delightful &quot;made for TV movie&quot;, hopefully someday soon we will see that come to pass.  &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is definitely a different type of book for John Grisham, but it is very enjoyable - - take a day or two out of your busy holiday schedule to read this book!!
B00005QK3B|5.0|Ive been a big Marillion fan since Script for a jesters tear and i must say that I love the Fish period of this band it was so much more interesting . Script was a great album , marillion kind of took a strang direction with with there second album Fugasi it was good but fish seemed to be very bitter over personal issues (which we all know he likes to share with us).<BR>But this knocked my socks off , talk about an amasing recording and the lyrics so profoundly put and totaly personal. The music on this CD (and Clutching at straws) defines Marillion and captures the magic that very few neo prog artist ever have. The beautiful intro of Psuedo silk kimono leading us to the huge hit song Kaylie onto the wonderful Lavender , and the musicianship on this and all marillion CD`s is in a special class that very few artist can or will ever match, its a class I would put perhaps Early Genesis , Kansas , Rush , Spocks beard , and perhaps The Flower kings.  Marillion are and deserve to be known as true prog legends, and this CD is a must buy, also get Script for a jesters tear and Clutching at straws.
B00006LJ72|3.0|Although this Box set was released in 2002, this set is basically a recycled &quot;Box of Dreams&quot; with new cover artwork and added tracks. Almost ALL of the content on this set exists on the Box Of Dreams trilogy released in 1998!<br />This is becoming a disturbing trend by record labels trying to to cash in on music buyers: Releasing already existing collections with new packaging artwork and added tracks! From a musical standpoint, this is a great multi-disc collection of music but this set could've been so much better. If it were possible they should've taken one of the discs and made it a total B-Sides collection instead of just including a few B-Sides and leaving out the rest. At least the amazingly haunting Isobella is available on here. It's a haunting track not too much different from Hope Has A Place or La Sonadora but better than both and Isobella would've propelled A Day Without Rain to a five star. Where are Morning Glory, I May Not Awaken, or Asbhaile(correct me if I misspelled it)? Enya has over ten B-Sides and they all should've been included on this set or on a single or double disc set. If they had all been put on here, this box set could've been the ultimate box set ever.<br />A thumbs down to the record labels where cashing in on the fanbase seems to have become a habit.
B00006M183|5.0|If you listen to rock radio you have probably heard the new Pearl Jam single \\"I Am Mine\\" which has a slower more organic feel to it. The rest of the album follows suit. It's not the thrashing Pearl Jam of old, but rather a more suddle introspective Pearl Jam. The best songs on the album are definitely \\"Thumbing my way,\\" \\"Love Boat Captain,\\" and Ghost.\\" If you like the slow Pearl Jam songs of old like \\"Black\\" and \\"Nothing Man\\" you'll love this. All around great CD from start to Finish, Pearl Jam at their best.
B00005YW4H|5.0|You will know when a star is born. And this certainly have to do with Norah's debut album with full of oomph in it!! With the review she got from the media, it certainly helps her to gain more attention. <br />This lady surely makes no mistakes by putting all those nice and smooth jazz into this CD. Being a newbie in jazz listening, I was even appauled by her strong vocals and catchy tunes. With few sampling from Track 1 to 3, I immediately purchased this CD from the store. <br />What I like most about this CD is that, after getting home from a hectic work schedule, I will play the CD right from Track 1 and listen till it stops. The songs makes me feel so comfortable and relax. It is like having a peace of mind forgetting all the hectic shhedules that I had went through the whole day and just sit back and relax. <br />For those of you who have listened to come away with me, Norah truly suggest you to have an enchanted evening listening to her songs and this CD will definitely be in my player for years to come. I have introduced this CD to so many friends and they like it from the point of listening. <br />If you have nothing to buy or looking for a jazz CD, try her out and you will definitely be converted!<BR>Otherwise, write back to me and let me know why !?
B00005JKL8|4.0|Don't watch this expecting anything more than an action-packed, melodramatic, shallow, attention-holding, rootin'-tootin', flag-wavin', cheesey, cat-and-mouse, shoot 'em up.  You'll be disappointed.  This is no Jane Austin adaptation.  Or We Were Soldiers for that matter.  There's not much serious drama going on here.  Look elsewhere.<br />Owen Wilson plays a Naval fighter plane's navigator.  His performance is not Oscar-worthy, but more than adequate.  He was funny and convincing.  (I don't understand all the protests over the choice of him to play this character in these reviews.  Who would they rather have?  Stallone?)  He and his pilot are shot down during a routine reconnaisance mission over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Gene Hackman plays the Admiral and commander of their carrier, and is handcuffed by NATO politics while trying to rescue his boys.  The race is on to extract Wilson before he's caught by the... uh, Bosnians--err, no wait.. the Serbians--uh... whatever, the bad guys.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by this films entertainment value.  Yes, it's a bit of a Navy commercial, but it's done well and looks great.  It's very fast-paced and loaded with thrills.  It held my attention throughout.  The special effects were impressive, albeit rather cheesey in their implementation.  Like a whole battalion shooting at a one running man and never hitting him.  But it's spirit and thrills makes up for that type of deus ex machina convention.  The effects sequence where their plane was being chased by a surface-to-air missile was nearly as good as can be done.  <br />The picture and audio quality of the DVD are top notch.  I've listened with only the DTS audio on, but I'm sure you'll find the other options done well also. The extras are a little spare, offering commentary, a short \\"featurette\\", and a couple trailers.<br />Overall I give this a 4 because it succeeds at entertaining, which is too infrequent of a quality in movies.
0321127420|5.0|This book gives a catalog of patterns for enterprise solutions based on layered architecture(he has not covered the filter/pipe pattern). It provides multiple probable solutions(In C# and Java) for many enterprise related issues/problems. Most of these issues are shared by J2EE/.NET/CORBA framework based applications. If the user has already read J2EE Design Patterns, Design Patterns(Gang of Four) books and worked on 3-4 Enterprise multi-layer applications, then this book makes a lot of sense. The solutions can be put to practice fairly easily , atleast in the J2EE app server based solution space.<br />BTW, this books is out of stock at Amazon, I ordered my copy from Barnes and Noble and got a good discount too.<br />The book was on the net for a while on martinfowler.com site and only after it was published at OOPSLA 02, was it removed. Going through the June 02 snapshot of this book provided for interested reading. The final version has been edited for easy reading and comes out pretty well.<br />CONS : <BR>1) Does not come with a CD :-)<BR>2) Does not use all(advanced) language facilities (to make it readable)
B00006RG9K|5.0|The first time I saw/listened to this I wasn't that impressed.  However, on the second run through, it really was a great selection.  The third time I loved it...  The Old Medley is awesome as is Driving the Last Spike.  The translation to 5.1 is not the best, but definitely gets by.  I would heartily recommend this for any Genesis fan.
B00003CXC6|5.0|A film about the subjective nature of truth, Rashomon is a startlingly original film from Japanese director Kurosawa. Well known and regarded for his classic samurai films, Kurosawa's rich and sharply observed personal films are often overlooked by most fans of Japanese cinema. It has more to do with Kurosawa's unconventional approach to storytelling than anything else. Like Hitchcock, Truffaut, Kubrick and Spielberg, Kurosawa uses the camera as truth detector. When a young woman is raped and her husband is killed, we are asked to interpret their various stories and figure out who's telling the truth. We realize, in the process, that everyone and no one is being completely truthful for a variety of selfish personal choices. We also begin to question the subjective nature of truth and personal observation about the world.<br />Mifune is marvelous as the rapist/killer/lover (you decide which hat he truly wears)in an unexpected role. He's just as compelling here as he was in The Seven Samurai and other Kurosawa epics.<br />The Criterion transfer is crisp rendering the black and white photographer in stark, sharp images whose beauty belies the ugly truth underneath it all. The extras include a running commentary by a Kurosawa scholar and loads of goodies including the original US run theatrical trailer. Given the age of the film and condition of the negative, the transfer is nearly flawless having none of the flaws I've seen in many video transfers and new prints of the film.<br />I'd highly recommend Rashomon for fans of Japanese cinema as well as anyone who likes entertainment to be more than a giant meatball.
B00006M183|4.0|This album has had me more excited than any other release this year, except for the coming Audioslave (Cornell w/RATM) release!<br />I can't believe no one has reviewed this album yet...it is great. For those who liked Yield but were disappointed with the production of Binaural (the songs were great live), this album will bring you back. &quot;Save You&quot; simultaneously evokes memories of &quot;Hail Hail&quot; and &quot;Brain of J&quot; at once, &quot;I Am Mine&quot; recalls the Vs. days (think of it as the new &quot;Daughter&quot;), and the rest of the songs are great too...especially &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot;, and the extremely trippy, almost techno, Matt Cameron-penned &quot;You Are&quot;.<br />In summary, if you're still waiting for Ten pt. 2, keep waiting. If you're looking for a great album by a band who keeps evolving and refuses to stay stagnant, get this record. I still like No Code and Vitalogy better, but this is on par with Yield for me, which was a mighty fine album.
B00002EPJH|5.0|My son gave me this CD and it quickly became one of my favorites.  I've since given it to two friends who both love it as much as I do.  Contemplative, sweet, but not overly sentimental -- just lovely.
055321263X|4.0|I read the book &quot;The Woman in White&quot; a few months ago, and ever since I have been thinking about writing a brief review about it; which I do now.<BR>     What I could gather from the story presented on those pages, after I read them and thought about their contents for a while, is that it is certainly a very beguiling one, and that Wilkie Collins has a great storytelling skill for sure. The way he narrates all the incidents which assailed the lives of the romantic couple Wlater Hartright - Laura Fairlie through the voices of the characters most directly involved with each of them undisputably mesmerizes the reader, and beguiles them into believing the whole fictitious story to have a great amount of truth in its core. It is definitely a book which a good reader shan't forget so early.<BR>     The only real flaw it displays, however, is that it is not a book directed to any kind of reader; in clearer terms, the principles of the peruser DO matter a lot when they decide whether they appreciated or not the book.<BR>     People with a romantic inclination shall obviously love the story, for it shows the reader a virtuous hero in the picture of Hartright; one in whose existence more practical and sceptic readers won't even believe. The same happens to the demure and sweet character of Laura Fairlie, whom even the surname indicates to be a perfect lady.<BR>     What I wish to impart is just that I really advise this book to be read by romantic people rather than realistic ones, who may find it too much surreal. As i have a little of a romantic and a little of a sceptic myself, I rated the book 4 stars, in order that I can express all my feelings towards it.
B0000542D2|5.0|I have loved this movie from the start and I have eagerly awaited a digital version.  Here it is and I am jazzed.  The picture quality is just great, for older black and white film originals.  I like the wide-screen format very much.  That is the only way to go.<br />The movie seems to have been re-done intact, so I am very happy with the flow and sequence of the film.  Then there are the extras.  I thought that having a second disk was a bit much, but, I did really enjoy the material.  You'll have to see for yourself.  I like the insights from the &quot;Fifth Beatle,&quot; and the comments from the people who actually worked on the project.  The bit I like most is finding out that the tailor, whose measuring tape is cut by John, is actually the tailor who made all their suits.  Trust me, If you have enjoyed A Hard Day's Night before, you'll love it all over again.
B00004RFCM|5.0|after recommended to me by a friend, i decided to get the series. after watching the first episode, i feel that it is quite boring. however, after reading the rave reviews, i decided to watch the 2nd episode. to my surprise, it got me. the subsequent episodes are so funny and nice. good acting, beautiful people and funny plots are what you can expect in this series. strongly recommended. but there are many nudities and vulgarities in this shows. skip it if you are offended by these.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This remarkable live recording is as close to 180 degrees removed from the choreographed, lip-synced, computer generated &quot;live&quot; performances of so many &quot;Pop&quot; performers of the last 20-30 years.<br />Other than the microphones what we are treated to here is the stunning artistry of 5 world-class musicians at the absolute top of their game.  Alison Krauss has been playing with bassist Barry Bales and guitarist-banjoist Ron Block for more than ten years.... Guitarist-Mandolinist Dan Tyminski was added about 7 years ago and Dobroist Jerry Douglas about 2 years ago.<br />I doubt Ms. Krauss would allow any inferior musical product to be released with her name attached, but, listening to these amazing live recordings, it appears to me that it has taken this long for this band to &quot;hit their stride&quot;.<br />To say that Jerry Douglas is &quot;the world's greatest dobro player&quot; is no small compliment, but your average music listening would likely be hard-pressed to name ANY dobro players.  Introducing him Alison correctly states that Mr. Douglas is widely viewed as one of the worlds great musicians - and by THAT title I include him among ranks of very rarified ability - Yo Yo Ma, Wynton Marsalis, Itzhak Perlman, Mark O'Connor, Chris Thile level of achievement.  The addition of Jerry Douglas to the ALREADY very accomplished AKUS has simply driven all the other band members to new heights instrumentally.  Ron Block sounds better than ever.  Dan Tyminski plays like Tony Rice in his prime.  Alison fiddles with the power and passion of Stuart Duncan.  This is the current version of AKUS, instrumentally.<br />Vocally.... has there ever been a &quot;Bluegrass&quot; band this good?  If you don't think Ms. Krauss is the most gifted female vocalist in the history of bluegrass you hold the minority opinion.  The meteoric rise and acclaim of Dan Tyminski has only let the rest of the world know what the Bluegrass community has known for over ten years - Dan Tyminski has a voice that is other-worldly good.  When they sing together.... it is almost painfully good to listen to - like the bite of the best dessert you ever put in your mouth or the odor of the best smell you ever experienced.<br />Writing about the talented Cox family Alison generously said that she expected when she arrived at heaven that they would be playing the Cox family's music.<br />I would guess that right now the angels are playing &quot;Alison Krauss and Union Station - Live&quot;.an Tyminski has a voice that is other-worldly good.

1883217040|5.0|I agree with the splendid reviews given by the others.  I'll add something which has made it helpful for me.  I like playing and improvising from fake books.  Fake books often don't give very interesting harmonies to use.  Levine's book gives you lots of alternatives for reharmonizing and also teaches you to think in terms of scales, which opens up all sorts of possibilities for improvising.<br />There's so much in the book that it bears re-reading many times.  I've gone over it many times as there's way too much to pick up at one, or even a few times.  I'll look to it for ideas, work on them, and then come back to add new ideas.<br />The Jazz Piano book has a lot of repeated material in it, but there's easily enough strictly piano stuff too be worth buying, if you're a pianist.<br />Levine's command of the material is pretty amazing.  For any concept he has several examples.
B000067CPX|5.0|It seems that almost everyone that i've talked to about this album came to me with the expectations of another Blood Sugar Sex Magic or another Mother's Milk. Well, i picked up this album expecting more of a Californication, it seems that noone had their expectations met, I, however, had my expections not met, but destroyed. At first listen to this album, I felt the same let down felling as probablly everyone else. But thanks to somgs like Dosed, Midnight, This is the Place, Tear, and Venice Queen, I forgot about my old exoectations and started to enjoy the symphonic melodies and the album as a whole. I fell that although this isn't old Chili Peppers; it was important for them to re-create themselves, in stead of being like Creed and playing the same song a million times with just diferent words. I fell that they created an awsome album which is one of the best Chili Peppers, and by far, the best album yet in 2002.
B000003TA4|5.0|Dude, I don't care what you say about Kurt and the boys, but this CD is a work of genius.  The people who don't like this disc are just angry MC Hammer and Whitney Houston fans who are still mad that Nirvana took them off the charts forever.  Buy this disc, and if you can, buy the Screaming Trees, who were making music right there with Nirvana.
B000002PCS|5.0|Having watched the movie (accidently coming upon it on t.v),I was drawn to the characters, acting, amazing musical score, time period and phenominal acting for Chris Reeves, Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer.  My heart was captured and I was brought to tears of joys and sorrow. It is truly a classic musical piece, writing and acting (not to mention how fabulous the costumes were! This grabbed my heart &amp; will never let go. Kudos to all! Buy the tape, DVD or whatever you have the format for in your home--you shall not regret it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I brought this CD based on the suggestion of some friends of mine, and I was really glad that I did. Norah Jones' COME AWAY WITH ME is smooth, mellow and romantic. After owning it only for one day and listening to it four times consecutively, I know this will be a CD that will stay in constant rotation in my home.<br />Ms. Jones will undoubtedly be compared to that other piano playing pop/jazz diva, Diana Krall, but there are distinct differences in their musical styles and their vocal abilities. Norah may have musical roots in jazz, but you can hear distinctive influences of pop, country and soul in her work. She also has a melodic, laid-back and cool vocal delivery that is very appealing. Her renditions of the standards &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; and &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; are outstanding, with her obvious knowledge of jazz phrasing. Norah gives us a touch of soul with &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, which has quickly become one of my favorites, along with the original tunes &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, &quot;Feelin' The Same Way&quot;, &quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot;, &quot;One Flight Down&quot; amd &quot;Painter Song&quot;. Norah Jones may only be 22, but her voice belies her years. If you enjoy Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson, or the music of the greats like Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington and Nina Simone, give this CD a try. It may not be straight jazz, but it is definitely worth listening to. Highly recommended.

B00006F83Y|2.0|A song by song review by a guy who has listened to this disc twenty times in the vain attempt to understand why so many otherwise rational human beings seem to think it's the greatest album since the formation of the Solar System.<br />Millionaire: Is the squawking vocalist supposed to be funny?  And how about that break when the song cuts off, and then it starts right up again!  How original!<br />No One Knows:  Bop-bop-doodle-doo!  Bop-bop-doodle-doo!  Over & over & over.  Why do so many people who listen to music that Actually Rocks get a kick out of this bouncy chunk of banality?  We get plenty of gushy \\"ooohs & aahhhs\\" to fill the background.  Nice big guitar break, though, even if Kiss did it better in Detroit Rock City.<br />First It Giveth:  Crooning lyrics and thumping drums and one really, really repetitive chorus.  Not truly bad, but there's nothing much to distinguish it from most mainstream stuff.<br />Song for the Dead:  Nice syncopation and trade-offs.  But those \\"awww-awww\\" background vocals get old fast.<br /><br />Sky is Falling:  More strained and crooning vocals, this time in the foreground as well as the background.  Another tune with a bop-bop-doodle-doo melodic line for guitar.  Really annoying, but when the guitar hammers it has power.<br /><br />Six Shooter:  Twangy, screamy, shallow silliness.  Maybe they thought it was funny when they recorded it.  Makes me yearn to hear some real punked out raving and turn this cheap imitation/parody off.<br />Hanging Tree:  Yawn.<br />Go With the Flow:  Kinda reminds me of a Phil Collins song.  Poppy banging piano, catchy little bounce to the chorus.  And even more crooning background vocals!  Weak as a day old kitten.  \\"If you believe it in your head...\\" indeed.<br />Gonna Leave You:  Even More 'Awww-awww' crooning going on in the background.  And another poppy refrain repeated until you could sing it backward.<br />Do It Again:  Doddle-doodle-doo-Bop!  Hey!  That's a change!  Same stale pop sensibilities though.<br /><br />God is in the Radio:  Different from the rest of the album except for having another fade out, fade back in conclusion.  Nice throbbing guitar with more than a little 'Spirit in the Sky' holding it up.<br />Another Love Song:  Pure pop for those who dig the stuff.  More \\"oooohhh-ahhhh\\" choruses, another boring refrain.<br />Song for the Deaf:  Probably the best tune on the disc.  Moodier and more powerful than the rest, with deep trippy breaks and no sign of the poppy bouncin' beats and sighing choirs that fill the rest.<br />Ha-ha-ha!  Doesn't this little extra cut kinda speak for itself?  Think they might be laughing at us?  All I know is that listening to it more than twice is unendurable.<br />Mosquito:  A really original cut here.  The slo-mo silent-movie-style piano and bombastic orchestration is pretty unique.  But there's another goddamn \\"ooooh-oooooh\\" chorus going on behind all the melodrama and it just doesn't go anywhere.  It doesn't rock, it doesn't charm, it doesn't do much of anything.  Is it supposed to be funny?  I guess I don't really care.<br /><br />And I can't forget all those Hilarious Comedy Skit DJ parodies!  Oh, my sides!  Especially funny after hearing them for the 20th time!<br />So there you have it-  the fruit of listening to this disc twenty times in two weeks.  I can't figure you guys out, but I think I know the main reason I dislike this disc.  It has distinctly artificial feel.  The only thing most of the songs share is a forced, bouncy pop beat.  The whole album is assembled from diced up pop rhythmns and riffs that are stuck together in a chunky, artificial fashion, with repetitive devices like that cursed chorus of 'oooohs'.and 'aaahhhhs\\" filling up the background.<br />Can you honestly say this weary stuff sounds New & Different to you?s though. <BR>      <BR>God is in the Radio:  Different from the rest of the album except for having another fade out, fade back in conclusion.

0446608955|5.0|The title of the book is A Walk to Remember. The author is Nicholas Sparks. My opinion about the book is: the story is sweet ,lovely, and a truly unforgettable story,&quot;a story that reminds us that in life each of us may find one great love, the kind that changes everything&quot;. On a scale form 1-10 I would rate the book with a 10, because it is an incomparable story, it is about how love canbreak frontiers, it is a wonderful love story. The evidence that I have about the book is &quot;There was a time when the world was sweeter...when the women of Beafort, North Carolina, wore dresses, and the men donned hats...when something happened to a seventeen-year-old boy that would change his life forever.&quot;-Nicholas Sparks. One remark about the author's style and voice is the way the author imagine this story is incomparable, it is so realistic. He also said &quot;First you will smile, and then you will cry-do not say you have not been warned.&quot; This can happen to anyone. If you liked &quot;Message in A Bottle&quot; or &quot;The Notebook&quot;, you will like this book. Katherine Maranon.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Reign of fire was an excellent film.  The cinematography was near perfect, and the special effects were breath-taking.  Its not a movie that everyone is going to like because it isn't very uplifting to see the human race stomped out to near extinction.  However, it is suspenseful and has a few suprises along the way.  The method in which the dragonhunters go about killing a dragon with all the high-tech computer equipment was fascinating.  The plot is somewhat thin, but it shows how boring the lives of humans became when they were forced to live in refuge and fear.  It needs to be in every sci-fi fan's DVD library!
B00006CXSS|5.0|There has never been a finer movie about WWII. It shows the special bonding that only takes place between men who have experienced combat together.  From the haunting theme music to the excruciating combat scenes, this was a compelling presentation of the power and pain of war. No other television program has so well demonstrated the overwhelming confusion and chaos that takes place in war or how a group of men, under stresses that would make most of us crack, could overcome their own fears and the forces arrayed against them.  The world owes its honor and respect to the men of Easy Company and the rest who gave their youth and their lives to overcome the Evil of their time.  To those who find the stresses and struggles of life today unbearable, especially those born after WWII, I suggest you watch this series and discover the difference that  courage, committment, and the dedication of a Band of Brothers can make in this world. May we never forget their sacrifices!
078401213X|4.0|Notes for the bewildered:<br />1. Pi is NOT about the number pi (I'm not sure some of these reviewers even watched the film);<br />2. Accusations that the film is more about numerology than mathematics miss the point by a mile, i.e. there is a vital scene in which the main character is plainly warned that his obsessive pattern search will lead him into the non-science desert of numerology;<br />3. Max's search for the 216 digit name of God is not a simple descent into mystical hooey: his investigation of the Torah, like the stock market, is a search for an underlying pattern in a chaotic system. He is intrigued by the possibility of arriving at a fundamental insight into the universe by this discovery. Ultimately his fallacy is not the assumption that this pattern exists, but his presumption that his brain could encompass the entire world.<br />Enough philosophy - the black and white photography is stark and unsettling, the minor characters are memorable (Lenny and Sol are standouts), the soundtrack is refreshingly modern and engaging without being obtrusive, and the whole is laden with a creepy atmosphere of cold cerebral obsession (this quality probably being the main reason people either love or hate this film).<br />Reasons for some dissatisfaction might include the hallucination sequences being only vaguely delineated from the rest of the narrative, which causes some confusion, and the discontinuity of the plot, in which story and character are artfully sketched rather than fully filled out.<br />The ending is also problematic, but it is unsatisfying only in as much as total comprehension of the universe by the human mind is an impossible dream. It is this intellectual tantalization which is, I believe, the point of the film.
B00006M183|4.0|HMMMMM.....I probably shouldnt be reviewing this yet, i have only listened to it about 4 times, but I thought it would be cool to be the first reviewer. Anyway, this album is not what I expected. I heard it was supposed to sound like PJ's old stuff, but it definetely doesnt, which is actually a very good thing. Most of the songs are very good, my favorites are probably Save You, Love Boat Captain, and You Are, although that is just what I think so far, I need to listen some more. You are is amazing, and almost sounds like some techno or industrial thing, but for some reason, it is just awesome. Save You has a nice riff and is a cool song all together. Love Boat Captain has a cool organ intro to it and is different from anything I have heard from PJ. I am Mine is a cool song both lyrically and musically, with a nice solo from Mike McCready. The other songs are all pretty cool too. One thing that really surprised me about this album is Matt Cameron's influence as a songwriter, and even a guitar player. He co-writes 4 songs, including two where he either co wrote lyrics or wrote lyrics by himself. He even plays rythym guitar on the awesome You Are. This seems to be a good thing, since the songs he helped write are all very good. Overall, this may not be as good overall as Vs. or Ten, but its a great album and I cant wait to see what these guys do next.

B0000630BT|5.0|Painkiller. Judas Priest's twelfth and final album with Rob Halford at the vocals. Up until this album, the band had literally gone through hell. The release of the prototype-album Turbo(1986) turned-off their older fans with the use of synthesizers and caused Priest's success to spiral forever downward. The followup Ram It Down(1988), although a step back in the right direction, did little to help gain the respect back of the older fans. Even the newfound Turbo fans hated it because it differed too greatly. Although the band had fun making the album, Priest was now out of steam and the producer and drummer quit on them, leaving them in a terrible state. To make matters worse, a lawsuit was filed against the band for two Stained Class(1978) songs apparently causing two teenagers to commit suicide. It lasted for four long weeks before Priest finally won the case, and proved that it was in fact the victims' home environments to blame and not the band. Later that year, Priest found a new drummer, Scott Travis, who's frantic pace breathed new life into the band's songs, and also a new producer, Chris Tsangarides, who worked with them way back on their 2nd album, Sad Wings Of Destiny(1976). The newly equipped Priest then unleashed Painkiller(1990) late into the year. Priest carried a lot of their current angst to drive each of the nine high-octane, thrashy songs. Gone were the happy tunes found in the previous albums. Judas Priest is back and with an unapologetic vengeance.<br />Kicking off is the incredible title track in which sheer intense drumming and powerful vocals grab hold of you and don't let go until the end. Next is the unique midpaced, yet underrated Hell Patrol. All Guns Blazing is the one track on here that I would say is a bit cheezy, but even still, Glenn and K.K.'s wild guitar playing still gives the song some strength. Leather Rebel is the album's machine-gun totting anthem, in the veins of the much earlier Hell Bent For Leather and Breaking The Law. Its live counterpart is less than stellar though, and shows that Halford's enthusiasm for the band is wearing thin. Metal Meltdown is the fastest song on there, resembling a darker version of their previous album's title track. Night Crawler and A Touch Of Evil are Painkiller's two haunting tracks: the latter slow, and the former resembling The Sentinel. BTHATA is solid, midpaced 80s thrash, with the greatest guitar tapping section in a heavy metal song. The album's strongest and most productional track, Battle Hymn/One Shot At Glory is an underrated Priest classic, with Glenn and K.K.'s guitar shredding abilities set on maximum. Living Bad Dreams is Painkiller's single studio cut ballad, which should have stayed in the album even though it's a break in the all-out metal assault.<br />Following the album's large-scale world tour, Halford quit the band in 1992 and started a solo career, which showed mixed results until his heavy metal return album Resurrection(2000). The remaining band was in stand-by, hiding from the fans for seven years until they found a replacement, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens and released Jugulator(1997). Unfortunately, this changed the band forever and fans lamented its new death metal, grunge sound.<br />So how does this album fare? Well, it's far removed from their earlier, more successful days, but at the same time, much different than Turbo or Ram It Down. Though Priest was no longer influencing popular metal, you have to wonder if this album really had some historical significance, because a whole lot of neo-classical power metal bands (and even Halford's Resurrection and Crucible albums) borrow HEAVILY from Painkiller. Hmm. Musically, it resembles old Metallica but with non-inspired lyrics. I noticed that many reviewers hated this album just because of \\"cheezy\\" lyrics. They may not be poetry in motion, but Halford sings them like no one else can. Just as I had mentioned before in my Ram It Down review, songs don't have to have good lyrics to simplyrock, and rocking is what this album does very well. I heartily recommend Painkiller, as its a worthy addition to top off the Priest discography. Come in open minded, and you will not be disappointed. Get ready because Judas Priest will rock your world one last time. And as they say, its better to burn out than to fade away...

B00006CXXU|3.0|On STRIPPED, Christina Aguilera sets out to prove yet again, for those not paying attention, that she's a first-rate vocalist. Too bad she sounds so miserable doing it. STRIPPED, though highly ambitious for a sophomore album, is also, at best, a self-indulgent mess masquerading as that all-important(and apparently all-encompassing)\\"adult\\" album that so many teen popsters have attempted with varied success(Justin Timberlake's JUSTIFIED being the best of the bunch). Consequently, if it's so necessary to bare your soul, why not at least make a record that isn't for the most part a snooze-inducing bore? Aguilera throws away all her 'Genie In A Bottle'/'Come On Over Baby' melodies in favor of a more R&B-styled approach--not hip-hop, per se, but rather the more traditional fare embraced by that overblown Alicia Keys and her gaggle of followers. To that end, Aguilera solicits Keys for the 'Fallin'-like ballad 'Impossible', and coupled with 'Walk Away' and 'Loving Me 4 Me', gives us three utterly boring and indistinguishable soul ballads that, ironically, never truly come to life. Not to say that she hasn't made concessions to current R&B trends--the opening 'Can't Hold Us Down' is fairly listenable, at least until Lil' Kim makes a not-brief-enough appearance with arguably the worst rapping of her career--her unusually limp rhyming sounds as if she's been listening to too many of mentor P.Diddy's records. The other hip-hop flavored track, 'Get Mine, Get Yours' is actually one of the better uptempo tracks on the album, though it's buried in the second half of the album. In fact, the album doesn't even get REALLY interesting(with the exception of the previously mentioned 'Can't..' and the arena rocker 'Fighter')until track eleven, when producer Linda Perry first surfaces with the appropriately titled 'Beautiful', which sees some(I said SOME)vocal restraint from Aguilera. A few of Perry's other contributions are among the set's better tracks, particularly 'Make Over' and 'Cruz'. But the two best tracks are the ones that would probably sound most at home on the radio--the set's most straightforward ballad, 'The Voice Within', though straight out of the Mariah Carey songbook, works on several levels, not the least of which are the great vocals and terrific melody. And then there's the highly reviled 'Dirrty', which seems to be this year's whipping boy song from critics and the press. All I can say is that I'm truly confused as to why--granted, the video is horrifically bad, but the song is easily the catchiest tune on the whole album, bar none. Vocally throughout, Aguilera continues to be left to her own devices--I don't think anyone can reign her in from riffing the hell out of a song, but she remains nonetheless a magnificent vocalist(and the riffing here is not nearly as bad as it was on that pile of garbage she passed off as a Christmas record a couple of years back). Ultimately, Aguilera should be commended for her ambition, though she may need to be reminded that it might be nice to convey some sense of enjoyment when exercising it.'.

B00006M183|4.0|This record will be well worth your time.  I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since the beginning and I am always amazed how different they sound from record to record (Check out &quot;You Are&quot; to hear what I mean). Only one song should have been left off...&quot;Bush Leaguer.&quot;  Not good.  Some songs may need repeated listens to get into them (e.g. &quot;Can't Keep&quot; and &quot;Cropduster&quot;, both of which are great) while others reveal themselves as top notch right away (e.g. &quot;I am mine&quot; &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;). Buy this record.  It's the REAL thing.  Not some knock off like Creed or thousands of other bands.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I've loved this movie sense I can remember, even if the goblins would freak me out, i still loved it!! And i think i always will. But now that I'm older, I start to look at the movie in a bit of a new way,  all the things you really have to think about, for instance the things the worm says.<br /> A 15 year old Jennifer Connelly, and a sexy David Bowie were great picks for this flick! Bowie just has that sex appeal and magical appearance for a perfect Goblin King, if they had picked anyone else it would not be as good. <br />A Gem of a movie for both young and old.
0394716787|4.0|The Complete Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe by Edgar Allan Poe is a collection of all of Poe's work. It has 73 tales in all, including stories, poems, essays, criticism, and journalistic writings. If you are looking for a good scare, this book is right up your alley. Pick from &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, and many more. &quot;The Bells&quot; and &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; are two of the poems in the book. Poe's great descriptive ability is shown in this collection and the tales will send a chill down your spine no matter how many times you read them. I would definitely recommend this book, but beware the vocabulary, it is pretty tough. But don't just take my word for it...
B00005JL2O|2.0|Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of the series. I have a very easy going sense of humor and it takes a lot to bore me. Well guess what, this one bored me. The Goldmember guy is a really stupid character and the plot is not all that funny. This movie must have been thrown together in a hurry because I could have easily written a better script givin the success and the characters in the series. I highly recommend waiting for this one to come out on cable and save your money. If you plan on giving this one as a christmas gift keep your eyes on the auction sites the day after christmas I'm sure you will see it again.
B00000K0E5|3.0|Pierce Brosnan's acting in his first movie may not be as good as in his more recent ones, but he does a pretty good job.  The villain is rather good.  Even the plot is pretty good.  The only complaint I have (and this is a huge one, folks) is that the soundtrack is the worst of all of the James Bond movies.  Needless to say, the song isn't the best we've heard, but suffice to say that there are some that are worse (Back in 1983 they released a song so unbelievably awful that in some countries it is a national day of mourning, and I am not referring to All Time High).  But the score is atrocious!  Eric Serra composer of such 'masterpieces' as The Fifth Element?  Goldeneye was almost ruined.  Where did the theme go?  A James Bond movie cannot survive with a score that has no James Bond theme and relies solely upon percussion tinks for action music!  Thank God for Tomorrow Never Dies...<BR>But, overlooking the frighteningly disgustingly atrocious music (and I know how hard that is), this is a pretty good Bond.  Lets hope Eric Serra doesn't come back to this franchise.

All 6 discs remastered with 1 hour extra of a documentary on John Carpenter.  Ya heard right...  it is already available in the UK...  since dvd discs were invented there, it seems the best stuff comes out there first, then here.  But keep your eyes opened because by Halloween 2003 you'll have a chance to get it for yourself.  Don't be foolish and jump the gun and order the UK version (released on Sept. 30th, 2002), because you can only play their Region discs in the UK; the U.S. dvd's are Region 1 dics... so be patient and hold on.  However...  a brand new kind of dvd is heading our way...called SUPERBIT ... it has super sound and is super clear.  A much higher resolution picture PLUS Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound to boot.  Cool, huh?  And superbit dvd's can be played on ANY dvd player:  that's right, they are multi-regional.  Who'd thunk that?  You won't have to buy those silly multi-regional adaptors for your dvd player or your playstation either (RegionX), and you won't need to go out and buy a Superbit Dvd Player to enjoy them. A whole slew of superbit dvd's are already on the market, ....    By the way...  The Exorcist Trilogy DVD Boxset is also headed our way very soon...  those lucky Brits already have their hands on this special edition.  Okay, okay.. I know you're thinkin', \\"What are ya, a know-it-all?\\"  \\"Why come you know too much?\\", and \\"When is Elvis comin' back, huh?!\\" ...  well, my kids... I tell ya... I get the big fat DVD REVIEW magazine each month from my local ...store and since it is from the UK it is packed full of info on what is headed our way a year before we hear about it.  AND, I spend a little time each week visiting [a website] for info on what movies are being made, like the new Superman 5 movie, starring Brenden Frasier. or the new movie FREDDY VS. JASON! ...  P.S.  Elvis is already here...on the brand new ELVIS 8 DVD BOXSET...  check him out... and uh, thank ya very much.

B00006JKOM|5.0|Too Old to Rock and Roll: Too Young To Die is an imaginary off Broadway musical concerning the growing critical view that all of the old classic rockers had seen their better days. And so like Elvis, the album heads for Las Vegas and puts on a lavish show that makes fun of the concept that age should ever have anything to do with being valid. Indeed, Jethro Tull laugh in the face of critics and the emerging Punk scene with this, a dreaded concept record!   The music is as much the means of communicating the feel of the play that never happened, as the lyrics are the words that the actors never sang. The guitar in quizz kid aptly captures the quick wit mind of it's protagonist, while driving nails into the very same persona's celebrity in the following song, Crazed Institution. Salamander plucks away with the heated passions brought on by desire, and Taxi Grab creates it's own traffic jam of music, caught up in the frustrations of life in general, and sex in particular. The sleazy sax solo from Dead Beat to an Old Greaser is plain enough, while the haunting one man blues of Bad-Eyed and Loveless bitterly paints it's scene in black, with only a single cold spotlight blaring down on the old fool who can't seem to get no satisfaction anymore. Big Dipper is a fond memory, captured in a playful mood that hints at the fun and games of the titles true meaning, but which in the end only leads our hero to the bitter end conclusions of the title track. Pied Piper is a recovery from that bitterness and self pity, emerging with a new found faith in life and leering joyfully on into the future. The Chequered Flag ends the story on a gentle note, sentimental but not sappy sweet. It builds upon the subtle beauty of a song like Requiem from the Minstrel album, only it manages to pluck more resonate heartstrings than the former. In the end, the complexities of the emotions presented musically and lyrically here expose Punk for the one dimensional, fly-by-night disposability that it was.    Of all the recordings in the Tull catalogue, this one and Broadsword and the Beast were in the most need of a remastering job. The sound here now sparkles with life as it should have done all along. There's never been a better time to own this fabulous recording so get it now before you are too old to rock and roll, or at least too deaf to hear it anymore.
B00005RJ1U|3.0|JEEPERS CREEPERS had so much potential. The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie were enthralling. The banter between the brother and sister was great, and rather realistic and other than the profanity reminded me of conversations I have had on long drives. The way one sees the Winnebago turn a corner in the backseat window and the BEATNU truck suddenly come up behind the sibling pair is a classic piece of cinematography. The way the film continues to build up with some more DUEL-type suspense is great. However, once the brother and sister check out the pipe behind the old church, the film starts to fall apart.<br /><br />The movie slows down a lot after that and I found myself fastforward viewing through the slowest moments. A lot of elements are introduced to the story that have little bearing on the plot. And the song, what in the world does the song Jeepers Creepers have to do with the movie? Nothing as far as I could tell.<br /><br />The Creeper itself may not have been that impressive of a monster. However, I found it nice for once to have a horror movie where the horror was a real monster. Unfortunately, this monster is indestructible. That makes the film rather disappointing. What's the point in fighting a battle (or watching a movie) where nothing, absolutely nothing, can be gained? I mean, come on, even Superman has kryptonite and demons can be exorcised; every creature has to have some weakness. But apparently, the Creeper doesn't. That's a shame because it would have made the showdown in the police station all that more interesting.
B000069AUI|5.0|Really this album is AWESOME. I don't need to say much more than that but if you liked Parachutes you'll love this one.
B00000099Y|1.0|With every time I come across something by Tool, I grow more and more irritated by Maynard's intolerably obnoxious attitude. Consider the way the man wants to have his cake and eat it too. On one hand, we're clearly to know that not only is he a Suffering Artist, but also a Profound Thinker as well. We are reminded of both many, many, many times - of the former by his hideously mangled screams, and of the latter by the ponderous liner notes, the formless videos, and the equally formless sludge of the music. Apocalyptic visions, tales of use and abuse, talk of \\"healing\\" and \\"salvation\\" are all de rigueur, and of course, all the faux-mysticism, pseudo-philosophy, and sundry babble are all as vague as possible. On the other hand, Maynard refuses to commit to this course, and holds himself carefully aloof from it with devices that are grating in their dishonesty. We're told as much in the asininely titled \\"Hooker With A Penis\\" - if we're dumb enough to, heaven forfend, call him on his frankly ludicrous philosopher-king pretensions, well, that's our own fault for not being cool enough to Get It, because Maynard is, you see, also a Very Clever Fellow, and can ceaselessly abuse the concept of irony in order to keep himself at arm's length from his own spoutings. Similar is \\"The Balls Of Satan,\\" yet another Witty Ironic Joke For Those Intelligent Enough To Understand It. Except the problem is that the irony is wretchedly illusive, as indeed is the entire album.<br />What does this record sound like? Not much of anything, but it sure is loud and it sure is very long. For arty post-pubescent teenagers with a penchant for vapid navel-gazing and intolerably lazy self-aggrandizement, it's manna from heaven. Melody is for losers, after all - the longer and the less listenable the affair, the better and the _deeper_ it is! If Tool has a defining element, it is sludge. Not too different from the Melvins, in that respect. For the muse descended upon Tool, and she spake thus: \\"Tool,remember this well. If you play fast sludge, this will be Aggressive. If you play slow sludge, this will be Ominous. Other bands are just Aggressive, so this will give your album Depth. And if you eschew melody as if it were the bubonic plague, you will be Unique and Against The Mainstream.\\" There's the Tool aesthetic - the less substance the better, since any level of detail will expose the utter lack of anything worth exposing, and vagueness gives everything a superficially \\"enigmatic\\" air. Okay, okay, so other artists have done this \\"oblique verbal cut-up\\" thing before, some with success, but they didn't do it in the context of an hour of bludgeoning guitar slime, and they had more than moving eyeballs to offer. At the very least, they were all honest enough not to act like they were above their own intellectual excesses. And moreover, their intellectual excesses themselves had a lot more class; Maynard, however, mixes meaningless exotic-sounding bromides with sheer crassness - what immediately comes to mind here is that monumentally imbecilic \\"auto-erotic lotus.\\" Look! It's obscene, it's ugly, it's utterly juvenile and inane, but it's shaped all weird, so that makes it a Symbol understandable to only the chosen elite, all of whom just happen to be Tool fans! No. Ugliness is not beauty; that notion is a pathetic cop-out for those with nothing beautiful to offer.<br />Tool are not the worst band to ever pretend to be meaningful. The A Perfect Circle album proved, if nothing else, that Maynard can sing when he feels like it, and rare parts of \\"Aenima\\" are alright simply by virtue of not being atonal. Apparently, this band means a great deal to many people, and really, that's just great, as far as I'm concerned. We all have our own ways of getting through life. But when people start claiming that Tool is some sort of incredibly deep intellectual \\"experience,\\" the time comes to take them aside and argue the point with them.

B000002WU9|5.0|1995 was a one of the greatest years in the history of hip hop. The underground circuit was strong and future stars were on the rise. The Wu-Tang had a world-wide appeal that was almost contagious. With several street bangers already in place who knew that a quit member that goes by the name &quot;The Chef&quot; would drop an album that would prove to be timeless. Raekwon's &quot;Only Built For Cubn Linx&quot; is not only the best Wu-Tang album created but one of the best Hip Hop albums of all time. How many CD's can you play all the way throught and be totally entertained as well as educated. Hell, even the skits were dope! Standout tracks such as &quot;Rainy Days&quot;, &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot;, &quot;Wu Gambino's&quot;, &quot;Ice-Cream&quot; and &quot;Knowledge God&quot; all represent classic Wu-Tang music......But on &quot;Verbal Intercourse&quot;..Nas drops one of hip hops hottest verses followed by an equally hungry Raekwon. The album is pretty much flawless and the outro is one of the best I've heard.

B000063UR2|3.0|Fantasy movies are rare. Good fantasy movies even more so. <br /> The story behind the movie is pretty simple--just about any fantasy author out there could tell this tale in a short story or at most a novella. Which is one of my problems with this movie. Some movies (like Battlefield Earth), try to cram 1000 pages of material into two hours. Legend stretches a mere yarn into a movie. What one gets is a lot of boring, drawn out scenes that just make one yawn alot. <br /> I found the ending rather disappointing, how they use light to kill darkness. It was far too childish and cliche for my taste. <br /> On the more positive side, I thought that Mia Sara was perfectly cast as the princess. And of course, the Dark Lord, even by today's harsh standards, looks very cool and evil. <br /> Younger people might like this movie, but for me, just reading a good fantasy novel--and there's lots of them, if you know where to look--is like a movie in itself.
B00004RFFU|5.0|The vampire movie has a long history in films whose focus ranges from the sardonic to the comic to the thriller.  But it took INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE to show the undead as having day to day problems not unlike those of their mortal victims.  Director Neil Jordan has taken Anne Rice's novel and glitzed it up with a kaleidoscope of color to present a three century leisurely flashback related by a vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) to a reporter Daniel (Christian Slater), who becomes more involved in the tale than at first he thought.  Though Louis does the telling, he shares center stage with his mentor vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise), who gives him the gift of eternal life.  During the long years of a life that stretches from the French Revolution to modern day America, Louis never loses sight of what it meant to be human, even with all its failings. Louis kills and kills again, but he hates who he is and shares a strange hate-love relationship with Lestat, who keeps trying to remind Louis that he is what he is and ought to take joy in that.  Much of the film revolves around a home-erotic relation between Lestat and Louis, and later between Louis and another French vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas).  There is a further subtext of incest between Louis and a very young girl Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Louis turns into a fellow vampire.  <BR>       <BR>     As in many vampire movies, the dramatic thrust is often equally divided between the frequent scenes of neck biting and the equally obvious eroticism enacted between vampire and victim.  In INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, both Louis and Lestat combine the historical bloodiness of earlier vampire movies with the pulsing sexuality that was raging in all concerned.  And while all of Louis' story is being recounted to David, the focus begins to shift ever so slightly from the one being interviewed to the one doing the interviewing.  During the course of the tale, David learns that human beings often present themselves to known vampires in the hope of joining the ranks of the undead, thus assuming their mantle of power.  David learns that it is not enough to wish to become a vampire.  One must be deemed worthy to become one.  This wish to stalk the living during the night is a potent one, yet the frequent films like this one portray the vampire as weaker than his victim.  In the world of the vampire, might does not make right, and INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE emphasizes this painful lesson only too well.
0321127420|5.0|This book is an enthralling read.  It is full of sound advice, tips, traps, and just plain old good common sense -- not to mention the patterns.  The patterns, like all good patterns, are not new.  They've been around for a long time.  However, in this book they are very well identified, specified, clarified, and classified.  Martin's writing is brilliant (as usual), and he brings the patterns to life with just the right mixture of prose and code.  Superb! <BR> <BR>Just as Design Patterns did seven years ago, this book will become the basis of a vocabulary that we will use from now on to speak about information system's architecture.  This one goes on your shelf right next to GOF -- but make sure you read it before you put it there!
B00004VWAF|5.0|This album documents incredible musical journeys.  You can hear the Stockhausen influence; some of the keyboards even sound like Can. There are only 4 tracks here, but two of them are extended workouts.  All of them engage in mind-blowing rhythmic patterns and instrumentation.  Not recommended for jazz purists, but definately for listeners with a sense of adventure.  <br />Not understood in its time and still not completely digested and understood today!
0395177111|5.0|I just finished reading The Hobbit for the first time in several years and was surprised by it.  This novel reads much easier than Tolkien's later books.  For anyone who hasn't read Tolkien before and has become interested, the Hobbit is a wonderful place to start.  Besides being one of the shortest novels, it also predates The Lord of the Rings, making it chronologically the novel to begin with. <br />The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo is a hobbit who goes and a grand adventure.  Unfortunately, hobbits do not like adventures and Bilbo takes a while becoming comfortable with the situation.  The novel takes place predominantly in three parts.  Tolkien develops his plot over the first part of the novel as the Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo travel to the Misty Mountains.  The second part deals with the adventures reaching the dragon.  And, the third part deals with confrontation of the dragon.  For novels this size, The Hobbit has more detail and plot than any self contained novel I have read.<br />But, I am decidedly biased in favor of Tolkien.  I have read all of his novels at least twice.  The open a world full of tragedy and heros.  The greatest of his work he never published.  However, the Hobbit is the first and inspiration for the Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien was a great author, and in writing the Hobbit wrote a novel that can be enjoyed by all ages.
0060920084|2.0|After reading only half of this book it's clear Bryson is bored. Perhaps he should just put away the typewriter, go work at Walmart as a greeter and work on his social skills.(Acually, I would buy that book!) Or maybe he should go out into the middle of a lightening storm so he can almost get hit by lightening. Maybe that would jolt some life back into his writing. <br />I'm used to, and can enjoy, Bryon's quasi-European thumbing of his nose on small town America and its inhabitants. But, I've read my computer manual with more facination. A day in the life of Bryson on the road: Get up, eat breakfast at lowlife cafe, drive under grey skies, look at stupid plaque denoting historical significance of area, eat lunch at a lowlife cafe, drive, reflect on childhood with father, eat dinner at lowlife cafe, get a hotel, watch the local access channel and ponder how it reflects stupid Americans, go to bed, repeat past day all over again.<br />...and again, and again.<br />I'll read his Austrailian book due to all the great reviews. It may sound crazy, but I actually feel a little bit bad for Bryson. He seemed very sad as he drove...and sadly missed...a great country.
B00005CDNK|4.0|Continuing the &quot;post-disco&quot; vein (is that a new description?) of 1980's Super Trouper, The Visitors is something you have to listen to a few times to get into. The opening four tracks have some expansive synth sounds and some sharp melodies. &quot;When all is said and done&quot; is a remarkable contrast of upbeat melody and trademark Abba chord changes with regretful &quot;split-up&quot; lyrics. <BR>&quot;Head over heels&quot; has quirky lyrics that could have appeared on any early Sparks album. The single &quot;One of us&quot; has another instantly memorable chorus and another heartbreak lyrical theme. On the minus side, &quot;Two for the price of one&quot;, which is so ridiculous it almost works, could be the silliest track they ever did.
B00005JLF5|4.0|If you want to checkout the \\"Dominion arc, and the USS Defiant\\" from beginning to end, I recommend you checkout Seasons 3-7, in that order.<br />If you want to checkout \\"Captain Sisko and Worf\\" from beginning to end, then I recommend you checkout Seasons 4-7, in that order.  <br />Season 3 is the real \\"new beginning\\" of DS9 (introduction of the Dominion, USS Defiant, beginning of story arcs), while Season 4's changes are more on the superficial, aesthetic side (Sisko's bald look, Worf coming to DS9 during the 2nd year of the Dominion arc).  I highly recommend you checkout Season 3 first (introduction of the Dominion, USS Defiant, beginning of story arcs), but if you are a person who wants \\"absolute, immediate satisfaction\\" (i.e. \\"How many episodes do I have to sit through, before I finally get to see Captain Sisko and Worf?\\"), then I recommend you start-off with Season 4.
0316666343|3.0|What a great book this could have been!  Great premise, great beginning. <BR>I started reading The Lovely Bones prepared to love it.  It came highly recommended.  Unfortunately it opened up important themes: what motivates serial sexual predators, and how a family copes with the aftermath of such an event and did little with it.  For example:   the dead protagonist - How did she feel understanding the torment her torturer had once endured himself?  Did she ever feel she wanted some kind of justice beyond an earthly one?  Did she ever feel torn between the immediate earthly concerns she had while continuing to monitor the lives of her family and friends and the presumably more enlightened view she would have obtained after death.  And what of her family, had they ever tried to deal with the aftermath of her death, their failure to come together would have been more compelling.  This book took on the big issues, but then took the shallow road out.  Too bad, it could have been great!
B00005JLCE|5.0|This is a FUNNY FUNNY ( one more time ...FUNNY!) movie. Madonna as Nikki Finn was BRILLAINT casting. Don't listen to the jaded journalists who have pigeonholed M into only one medium of entertainment.(OK SO SHE HAS MADE SOME BAD MOVIES...BUT THIS ISNT ONE OF THEM) Griffin Dunne is great as M's sidekick in this fast paced comedy. Give it a chance.....its no dud! <br />e n j o y <BR>CIAO MADONNA!
B00003CX8Y|3.0|I think that this movie is well.I don't think it is my type of movie though.Cause I like Action movies!
B000065U1N|3.0|i enjoyed this movie although i wouldent see it a secound time, this is one of those movies you don't reget seeing one time.  but not on my list of collectables.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Well,neither because that movie is perhaps the most adventure/action movie I have ever seen with some kids in it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I had my doubts about toby muguire, but about a half hour into the movie i new he was spider-man, and mild or nerd-y peter parker.  great movie for all ages. there were some cartoon parts that dident seem real to me but over all sam raimi did a great job in the directing of this movie.
B00006HBUA|2.0|The movie version of \\"Scooby Doo\\" does a good job capturing the look, the sound and the feel of the original cartoon series - which may explain why it works effectively for the first 15 minutes or so and for no time thereafter.  The creators of the show knew what they were doing when they limited their running time to a mere half hour (minus commercials).  And, even though the film lasts only a short 86 minutes itself, this particular installment is still a full hour longer than any \\"Scooby Doo\\" episode has a right to be.<br />Although the film itself is a witless bore, special praise should still be lavished on Matthew Lillard, who does a bang up job as Shaggy, Scooby's hyperkinetic best friend.  Lillard has nailed down the look, the voice and the mannerisms of the character to a tee and one hopes his career will go far once he ends up in more substantive vehicles than the one he is trapped in here.  The other actors (Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar and Linda Cardellini) provide the requisite energy for the roles they've been called on to play and cannot be held responsible for the overall shoddy nature of the uninspired screenplay.  As with most modern day \\"event\\" pictures, the special effects here end up overwhelming the pedestrian storyline, but this lowest-common-denominator aspiration seems to be what pulls in the big box office bucks these days so I guess we're stuck with it, at least for the foreseeable future.  Scooby Doo himself seems like just another CGI effect, partly because, as a character, his inarticulateness ends up relegating him to the status of secondary player in his own movie.  He just doesn't seem very important to the action of the story.<br />\\"Scooby Doo\\" has a nice, sunny look to it and it is never really offensively bad.  It simply makes one nostalgic for the days when crowd-pleasing blockbusters (\\"Star Wars,\\" \\"E.T.\\" etc.) could, in addition to entertaining us, make us both believe and care.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie was quite thrilling. I love to see a red, masked man swooping through skyscrapers and taxi cabs, into burning buildings and busy bridges. I also loved the fascinating battle between good and evil, and the struggle within the characters between their human and superhero personas. Very intriguing and mysterious.<br /><br />However, I felt the ending was kind of weak. I realize it was a lead-in to a sequel, but really, something more has to go on there. I don't want to give anything away, but those who have seen the movie might know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Also, I felt the additional content was rather lacking. You have to give customers something more exciting than a few sloppy histories of comic books and commentaries on the film. I was underimpressed.<br /><br />But the movie was good. Quite good.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer grabbed me from the first note and did not let me go.  &quot;In an interstellar burst, I'm back to save the universe!&quot; This CD is so beautiful and powerful that it gives me the chills and almost makes me cry.

B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is right at the top of my list of favorite Mel Gibson movies, and darn near the top of my overall favorite movies list. Mel Gibson expresses the passion of Wallace, and his determination to preserve freedom for his people. I can never watch this movie without stirring up the Scottish spirit in me, the primal unity with bagpipe and kilt. I want to let out a highland roar and march onto whatever my duties are in life, preserving truth, beauty, and liberty wherever I go.<br /><br />I still don't quite understand why Gibson put that sex scene in there, though. Yes, they got married, but please keep the resultant details off the screen.
B00003CXFG|3.0|This movie was very enterteining.Although I was expecting the same old science fiction movie about a group of persons beeing chased by a monster, I realized that this movie has some plot twists that makes it a little different from the rest.<BR>Of course, not including &quot;Aliens&quot;.<br />When a spaship suddenly needs to make an emergency land in a unknown planet and only a few people survive, we are telling you the begining of Pitch Black.<BR>This group of like eight people will have to find a way to hide from this strange and powerfull aliens that live on the planet in the pitch black dark.<BR>But why do they have to hide if this planet has 3 suns?, ´Cause ther´s an eclipse coming on, and the survivers needs to get the hell out of there.<br />I thought that this movie had one of the most impressive, well done and original crash scene.It was so cool.<BR>Then, when the aliens appeared, they looked like a bunch of crows flying fast.But then we could see thath they were bigger than a crow, scarier than a crow and obviously more dangerous than a crow.<BR>This aliens were really bad.<br />Vin Diesel was great, he made the movie.That eyes were so cool.And the sun glases too,<BR>Radah Mitchell was excellent, she´s so beautiful and talented.It was a real shame that she...well...you know(Spoiler).<BR>The little girl/Kid was fine, she/he knew how to act.<br />A lowdown of thi movie was that it started with a blast and slowdowned a lot after they investigated the planet.<BR>But the last 30 minutes were awesome, and the end is totally unpredictable.<br />Pitch Black is an interesting movie for a boring day.<br />PITCH BLACK<BR>With: Vin Diesel, Radah Mitchell<BR>Year or realease: 2000<BR>Running time: 110 minutes<BR>Origin: U.S.A.<br />Final Grade: C+(7)
B00005JKDR|5.0|I really enjoyed this Disney movie. Others I have thought were less than funny, somewhat boring, or what have you; but this movie kept me laughing throughout its entirety. Mike, the little green ball, particularly amused me. And the humor was not tainted by the subtle innuendos that are occasionally slipped into movies like Shrek.<br />And check out the outtakes and the additional short films. Quite clever. *laughs*
6305165912|5.0|The Big Lebowski is by far my favorite film EVER, which is why i have memorized pretty much every single detail in the film -- has anyone else noticed that at the beginning of the film in the superette scene, the Dude writes a check for 69 cents and signs it September 11, 1991 --exactly 10 years to the day--while the checkout chick is watching George Bush Sr on television talking about the war with Iraq?  \\"This agression will not stand\\".. Pretty uncanny and unnerving connection. At any rate, The Big Lebowski is an absolute MUST SEE.
B000066NW0|4.0|I had the chance to buy this cd and let me tell you it is one of the best debuts I've heard from an artist.  Most of the songs verge on pop-rock.  Don't be fooled by the singles.  The cd contains many great songs.  My favorite is &quot;Losing Grip&quot;.  The only one I don't like is &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.
B000001DVV|4.0|Ugly Kid Joe's America's Least Wanted is one of the first CDs i bought and i bought it after only hearing their cover of Harry Chapin's \\"Cats In The Cradle\\" on the radio and seeing it on MTV.  This album really grew on me after a few listens and out of the many albums i owned back in the early 90s, i still own this one and really enjoy it.  There's something really fun about the album and it's nice to see that this band which shouldn't take itself too seriously doesn't.<br />The album has a lot of concept songs about things such as \\"Goddamn Devil,\\" \\"Neighbor,\\" and \\"Madman ('92 Re-Mix).\\"  I pretty much like all of the songs equally as they all have their own charm.  The music really rocks and vocals are great.  The choruses are worthy of singing along loudly.  Not really many deep statements here, but the album is funny, obnoxious, cheesy, loud, and still manages to be creative.  So get this album, crank it up loud, drink some beer, and bang your head.
B00006690G|4.0|Actually, to me, this album gets 4 1/2 stars.  It is that good.  I love most of the songs.  Not only is this album different sonically from The Marshall Mathers LP, but Eminem gets more personal. Also, the rock mix in some of the songs give them grit and power.  Standout tracks for me include: White America, Business, Square Dance, Without Me, Superman, When the Music Stops, Till I Colapse and My Dad's gone crazy.  <br />This album would have gotten five stars if the song \\"Drips\\" wouldn't have been included. This song is absolutely awful.  One of the worst rap songs I've ever heard.
0743216458|5.0|I must amit I am a big Stephon E. Ambrose fan. Every book he make is like a journey to past for me. I must also say that this book BAND OF BROTHERS is the best WWII book I ever read, and im a Historian. SO indeed I have read many books. This book shows the meaning of order between a friend and a commared. I really encourage the youth even adult to read this novel formany reasons. ONe of them is cause of the historical events you never heard of-even if you think you have.
B000002BE9|3.0|This cd is pretty dark and moody, and some of the songs seem on the brink of breaking out, but it's still a great album.  The standout tracks are: Sleep to Dream, Shadowboxer, Criminal, Slow like Honey and Never is a Promise.  A wonderful cd if you aren't depressed, for it will not lift your spirits up.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie was definately one of the best movies that i have seen. I am a huge fan of the books...and i think that this movie faithfully followed the book and the cast was excellent! I also suggest for everyone to go see the second movie which is in theatres now because it is spectacular.
B000068QY7|2.0|Awful.  I mean, just...awful.  This would have been a one-star review if not for \\"The Hindu Times\\" and Liam's \\"Songbird\\" (gorgeous but should have been longer and had a bridge) and \\"Better Man\\" (which is good, but a little too derivative and kind of one-dimensional).  <br />Elsewhere, it's like Noel was TRYING to write crap.   \\"Force of Nature\\" is a dirge and destorys any momentum built up by the opener (and features Noel's flattest singing yet), \\"stop crying your heart out\\" is bryan adams/journey arena rock by numbers, \\"little by little\\" tries too hard to be populist, \\"she is love\\" is b-side material at its' least appealling.  The rest doesn't even merit my badmouthing. <br />The band sounds like hired guns doing as told, which is what they are.  Bonehead and Guigsy were by no strecth of the imagination viruosos, but that was a large part of the appeal of Oasis: mancunian ruffians who've got three chords and a gift for melody (and bad behavior).<br /> Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory (as well as 90% of Masterplan) are incredible examples of songcraft, with terrific performances by the band and Liam, but this...I dunno, Noel, are you trying to sabotage yr brother's burgeoning abilities as a sonmgwriter by surrounding Liam's songs with material so bad that no one would buy the album?

B000060OFT|5.0|Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is all about excess. Shakespeare was all about toying, spinning, ripping out lyrics like a rhetorical funkmeister. And had he been born in our time, he would have either been a grand master flash DJ or a rhyming Tom Clancy with heavy-duty familial, existential, societal, religious overtones.<br />Luhrmann so GETS what Shakespeare was doing at a youthful, cocky 30-31 years of age, it's stunning. This is the most fun version of Romeo and Juliet I've ever seen, and sure, the die-hard Shakespearianites (the same cats whose PhD salaries get their kids into private schools and Macy's clothes) will say it doesn't treat Romeo and Juliet with enough reverence.<br />Hogwash! Romeo and Juliet IS a sentimental play and it's my opinion that someone who can film the play with a realized sense of irony probably has as much (if not more) reverence and understanding of the film as any cat teaching at a state-level university.<br />...<br />:~)<br />Stacey
B00006IR5S|5.0|i bought it the first day it came out...andit was the third one left! i didnt think it could get any better, but it did. the themes arent as innocent as before but a bit darker, a little bit more mysterious. yes harrys wonderous world is on here again, i would have rather had hedwigs theme again, but the fawkes the phoenix track makes up for it. it isnt in chronological order like the first soundtrack- for example gilderoy lockhart is #4 wheras the cornish pixies track is # 15. its sort of weird, but it flows better how it is rather than trying to program it so it is in chronological order (i tried...). there are some songs that are completely new but there are others that have the same theme as the ones in the SS soundtrack, but JW tweaks it so it builds and adapts to the new movie.its beautiful though.there is also that 'hero' quality if you know wht i mean...its a must buy! it is very touching you listen to it and you just feel so harry potter. just like the first soundtrack you can feel all the emotions felt from the movie and the book. it really is just beautiful.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Let's be honest. A movie with Vin Deisel & Paul Walker? It drums up reactions of Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), James Van Der Beek and Scott Caan (Varsity Blues). I happen to feel as though they were all great performances, but beauty sometimes out ways credibility. Regardless of how hot the stars in this movie were, they proved that they could pull off a pretty good flick. It did have it's cheese factors (Paul Walker spining the Supra to a hault, firing two shots and taking care of the bad guy) but the cheese was far out weighed by the non stop action. The cars in itself would be reason enough to watch it! Yet again I go back to hot boys and hot cars. This film definately has it's target market.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth holds a place deep in my ears, mind, and heart.  I've never had such a privledge to listen to such beatiful, intricate, complex, and unprecidented music.  These musical masters are in a league of their own.  I pray this album does well and that Mikkael gets the credit he deserves.  If you liked this and it's the only opeth album you have, then you should treat yourself to all 5 of the other albums as well as the upcoming release of Damnation.  Though they have matured with their sense of musical transition and vocal accompanyment, the older albums are still wonderful.

B00004T0UT|5.0|This isn't just the greatest Elvis album ever, but the best album period.  Elvis' voice is fantastic, and his interpretation of the songs is outstanding.<br />There is no other singer in the history of popular music that could pull off an album like this.  Elvis covers pop, soul, blues, rock, country, gospel....If this record was done now, by a contemporary artist, it would be considered revolutionary.<br />Buy this album and you won't be disappointed.  It shows that Elvis was as important in the late 60's as he was in the 50's (And he continued to be in the 70's, or have we forgotten the Aloha from Hawaii special, something that had never been tried before).<br />From Elvis in Memphis shows the greatest entertainer in history reinventing himself, and contains Elvis' most mature music he had done to that point.<br />TCB Baby !!
B000002OX5|5.0|This album is simply amazing, like &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, it is a concept album, however it is not a rock opera. The album concept is that of a London radio station. It plays to the Who's witty lyrics, pop sensibility, and good sense of humour. &quot;I Can See Miles&quot; is probably one of the Who's best singles ever.I rate this album right up with their best. The album is definitely the begining of &quot;Tommy&quot; as the Who seemed to truly find their true voice. The album flows as well as &quot;Tommy&quot; and in my opinion has songs as good as any of their albums.
B00004WGC4|1.0|although I enjoy fawlty towers very much this collection is too boring --- there is a really boring interview that lasts forever right before each episode.  they could easily have put more episodes in the collection if they only would eliminate those interviews...<br />well --- sigh --- live and learn...
0688170528|5.0|I just finished reading &quot;The Pact&quot; today. Altough it was extremly hard to end this book, I learned so much from it. Its amazing how much someone elses words can change and inspire you. Thats exactly what Jodi Picoult did. Her words touched not only my heart but my mind as well. She vividly captures the essence of each character, and by the end of the novel you know them as well as your own family. She has a uniqe sense of style in how she illistrates the minds and thoughts of each character. I think anyone who reads this book will walk away changed in some way. This book gave my mind many things to analyze and contemplate while I was reading it. It made me realize that you should cherish and enjoy the time you have with the ones you love, because they just might not be there tomorrow. The love that you see from each character in this book is different in many ways but yet it all ties in together. You also realize that the way a person seems to be isn't always the truth, and some times you don't see whats wrong until its to late. A good book like this dosn't come around that often and so I can honestly say that &quot;The Pact&quot; is not just a book I read, but its a book that i felt as well. I believe that anyone who reads this book will learn something they didn't know about themeselves. So to anyone who is thinking about reading &quot;The Pact&quot; its an excellent choice and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

These 2 guys sound like Hound Dog Taylor with a little bit of Jimi Hendrix. This is what I have been wishing for for a long time, a band that isn't trying to reinvent the wheel, they love old blues and they play old blues. These 2 white boys sound like they came from the south side of Chicago in the 60's.<BR>I am eagerly awaiting the next Black Keys album.

B00006LJ72|4.0|I first fell in love with the music of Enya when one of her tracks (&quot;Ebudae&quot; from SHEPHERD MOONS) was played over the final scene of an episode of &quot;Northern Exposure.&quot; It remains one of my favorite songs.  It's included here along with four dozen other songs from her five studio albums dating back to 1987's THE CELTS.<br />So what's the problem?  Let's face it, most fans already have the music collected in this box set.  After all, Enya has released only five studio albums during the past fifteen years and fans (like me)eagerly bought each new release.  So what is new here?  Not much.  There are only seven songs that --although all previously released--have never appeared on any of those five studio albums:  &quot;Oiche Chun (Silent Night),&quot; &quot;Eclipse,&quot; &quot;Isobella,&quot; &quot;Song of the Sandman,&quot; &quot;Willows on the Water,&quot; &quot;The First of Autumn&quot; and &quot;May It Be,&quot; the Oscar-nominated song from the film &quot;Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;  [Although it should be noted that &quot;Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Willows on the Water&quot; did appear on the 1998 3-CD collection A BOX OF DREAMS.]  All seven of these songs were originally released as the A-side or the B-side of a single, but not included on any of her studio albums.<br />In addition the enhanced CD contains footage of &quot;Oiche Chun,&quot; first aired on the BBC in 1996.  Also included is a 48-page booklet with a complete discography, photos and liner notes by lyricist Roma Ryan.  This box set is a real treat for both new and longtime fans.  My only complaint is that the serious fan is being asked to pay a hefty price to add only a handful of otherwise hard-to-find songs to their collection.  The dedicated fan would have been better served by a single disc update of 1997's PAINT THE SKY WITH STARS: THE BEST OF ENYA. [It's also worth noting that the two new songs--&quot;Only If...&quot; and &quot;Paint the Sky With Stars&quot;-- on THAT collection are NOT included here.]  Those concerns aside, this is a thoroughly satisfying collection.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDion are NOT included here.]  Those concerns aside, this is a thoroughly satisfying collection.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00006M183|5.0|I have been a huge Pearl Jam fan since the beginning and have loved all of their albums, but Riot Act may just be my favorite.  Cropduster is a catching, insightful tune that has been in my head constantly since I first heard it.  Love Boat Captain and Thumbing My Way are thoughtful, beautiful songs.  Save You is a classic PJ rocker in the spirit of Go and Porch.  You Are is like nothing the band has ever done before, and I appreciate its uniqueness.  Also, 1/2 Full is a standout track.  McCready's guitar work on this song is very Hendrix-like.  Overall, an amazing album with outstanding guitar work, Matt Cameron at his best, and thoughful, insightful lyrics.  Buy this album!
0553296981|3.0|I had to read this book for my english class in 7th grade.  When I first read it, I was appalled at some of the stuff that she writes in her diary.  And I still am.<br />The story is about a young girl who goes into hidding, because she is Jewish.  The plot is good and all, and the writting is exceptional.  But, what Anne, age 13 at the beginning, writes, just scared me, adn gave me nightmares for weeks.<br />She seems to be...um...quite intersted about her changing self, and puts a lot in about how she changes, which, believe, isn't something most kids want to read about.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving the novel a one, is that some points it is interesting.  Only once or twice.
0151008116|2.0|What can i say? When i finished the first 100 pages of this book i was honestly gasping for more. I felt it was inventive, intelligent and so wonderfully poignant. The author tackles religion, identity and animal behaviour so crisply and so cogently. It was an absorbing read and i was beginnning to settle down under the covers with a cup of coffee to savour what i had christened \\"the jungle book meets the old man and the sea\\", a book of shimmering wit, one whose freshness is as compelling as it is thought provoking. How disappointed i was to be, the next 200 pages are simply about a boy, a tiger, a lifeboat and miles and miles of the pacific. It reads like a survival manual. All the superb ideas that the author introduced us to in the first 1/3rd of the book are suddenly and annoyingly abandoned for what i can only call page after page of tedious,long drawn suffering and ennui that actually starts grating on your mind after a while and you actually have to keep reminding yourself that this book won the booker this year and u cant help but ask yourself what was the panel thinking. Have i missed something here? I really dont know but i am dejected and a little surprised because i just know that Yann Martel probably had great designs for this book. But i just find myself wondering whether those designs are cleverly embedded within the book's apparently straight forward theme of isolation and madness or are there any messages here in the first place. Something is frightfully wrong with this book. Anyway so much for the booker and yann martel and richard parker and good ol' pie. Lets hope we are not faced with more such inexplicably boring material in the future, and that too, from the table of the booker panel. But i stand by this, u can read the first 100 pages. After that, just put it away, u will begin a tiresome journey of message mining on a level of expectancy that will be as dejecting as the horizon before pi's boat is perpetually empty and unpromising.
0064407667|5.0|If you are between the ages of 8-100, this is one great book for you! In this book, there is an enormous amount of suspense and you don't have to wait until the end of the book the get into it! I loved this first book, and I am 15 years old. This set of books is one that all ages can read. Each book carries onto the next! I won't ruin the story, so go out and find this extremly great and outstanding book!
B0000251VS|5.0|There was life in the undead Eddie long before Bruce Bruce became Maiden's \\"Air raid siren\\"! Di Anno's fronted Maiden broke in the UK after playing pub gigs and small shows. Featuring not one but two instrumentals and a host of creepy, hauntingly melodic pieces, Killers is Maiden showing their musicanship to the world as a true rock band. Murders in the Rue Morgue, loosely based on the E.A. Poe story and Killers carefully construct scenes of despair and inner torment without being overly fast and aggressive musically. The band understood that punk was dying if not dead and made the necessary adjustments on this album, but still pay tribute to their roots with \\"Wrathchild\\". You get the full range of Maiden's talent without suffering from one member outshining the other. This is one of the most competent Maiden albums you can find, just after breaking with their debut album and before the mega success of Number of the Beast. Evolution and cash flow were necessary and the addition of one of the greatest and most influential vocalists in metal Bruce Bruce (Dickinson) cemented Iron Maiden's place among the best.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I once had a conversation with a friend who had loved Mellow Gold and Odelay.  He didn't like Mutations, however, because it was \\"too country\\", or Midnight Vultures, because it \\"sounds like Prince\\".  I finally realized that he only appreciated Beck as a cool, hepcat wiseass, not as the creative, genius-level songwriter that he truly is.<br />If you're looking for another \\"Loser\\" or \\"Where It's At\\", you ain't gonna find it here.  Like all great artists, Beck is continually refining his approach.  Each time he makes a new record, he applies his craft in a different direction.  In the case of Sea Change, the resulting songs are dark, weary, lonesome, and absolutely brilliant.  The music is superficially similiar to the low-key country/folk-rock of Mutations, but sounding far deeper and more organic, with electronic touches for color and texture.  What's most remarkable, though, is that for the first time in his chameleonic career, Beck is truly baring his soul, giving us an unfliching portrait of a troubled man.<br />Sea Change is difficult going at first, but with repeated listening, its emotional impact is overwhelming.  The best compliment I can give this album is to say that it reminds me of Neil Young's Tonight's the Night, and coming from this Young fanatic, that is high praise indeed.

B000005DQR|5.0|I'm not sure what more I can add, since I see that this album averages 5 stars from 120+ reviewers.  Obviously I'm not alone in my love, awe, and respect for DJ Shadow.  So I'll simply say that this is one of the greatest albums ever recorded, and maybe the greatest thing produced in the entire decade of the 1990s.  If you truly love modern music, without regard for silly conventions of style, genre, marketing, etc., then you must own this album.

B0000524CY|5.0|Man, Man, I remember many things about the Exorcist back in the day and it would take me longer than this website to write them all down.<br />Some facts - this film was written and produced by William Peter Blatty, based upon his best-selling book and directed by William Freidkin, who would leter direct the Academy Award Winning The French Connection.   This film stars Ellen Burstyn, who plays Chris McNeil, a role originally offered to Jane Fonda.   Linda Blair as Regan, the possessed 12 year old girl.   Kitty Winn as Sharon, Regans' nanny.   Max Von Sydow as Father Lancaster Merrin, the priest who saves Regan from the devil.  Jason Miller as Father Karras, the troubled priest who assists Father Merrin.  Lee J. Cobb as Kinderman, a cop, a role originally offered to Paul Newman.  And, Jack McGowran, as film director Burke Dennings, Chris' boyfriend.<br />THE EXORCIST was released theatrically on December 26, 1973 and was widely acclaimed but also widely criticized.   A film, so potent back then, that drove crowds outside theatres for hours and theatre ushers actually provided barf bags to their patrons.  People actually did get sick after watching the film.   Paople would be driven to drink after watching this film. This film was widely criticized by religious groups, which was widely ignored.   This film was also widely acclaimed by film goers and film critics, alike.   Also, this film spawned any imitations on film, television etc., and was the butt of jokes and unleashed two very bad sequels.<br />This film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 1974, including Best Picture but only walked away with Best Adapted Screenplay by William Peter Blatty and Best Sound.   That was a downer as I felt this film deserved more and better Awards.<br />The film story is basicaslly simple - a 12 year old girl, mysteriously, becomes possessed by the devil and a priest is sent in to drive out the evil spirit and save the girl.<br />I have always loved watching THE EXORCIST and tomy surprise in 2000, THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN was released theatrically in September of that year, with 11 minutes of extra footage and I was quite impressed after watching this film.<br />The film begins differently with footage of the McNeil house and a church statue, the first piece of unseen footage.  Then, we are taken to Northern Iraq, where Father Lancaster Merrin is on a foreign mission, which is a ten minute sequence.   Then, we are taken to Georgetown, the McNiel home as the story and possession develops around Linda Blair.<br />The second piece of unseen footage involves a first medical examination of Linda Blair which is a five minute sequence showing first signs of her possession.   The most notable piece of unseen footage and always talked about was the \\"spiderwalk\\", when Regan in acrobatic form runs down the stairs like a spider with blood gushing out of her mouth.   The other pieces of unseen footage were more extended dialogue pieces that made more sense to the film.   Lastly, the ending is much different as Kinderman and Father Dier walk on the street past the vacant McNiel house, an ending that was much better than the always seeen one, which was always considered a downer.<br />I really enjoyed THE EXORCIST - THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN very much.  Let it be known that this is William Peter Blatty's version of all the footage he wanted to put back into the film.   William Freidkin, the director, back then felt that all the additional scenes were all unnecessary to which I disagree with, after watching this film.   I am veryglad that the \\"Williams\\", made the right move by releasing this film, again, to the masses.<br />This DVD is a little different than the 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION, that was released in 1998.   THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN has all the interactive Menus and such, presented in Digitial 5.1 Sound and picture quality that is crisp and clear.  ALso, there are 2 theatrical trailers, 4 TV Spots and 2 Radio Spots, and Commentaryby director, William Freidkin.   THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN has less Special Features than the 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION but this is the DVD that has the extra footage.<br />I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who are fans of the genre and films of the Golden Age.  This film will leave you possessed.<br />Get Your Copy Today !!!...
B000005AYM|5.0|She has a style all her own, I love it!
B00005JKZT|5.0|For these reasons.<br />1)  No, I don't believe that Fellowship was a fluke.  Two Towers and Return of the KIng will likely be just as good for this reason.  These films were shot in succession.  That means that most of the actors styles will not change, and the actors don't look different and act in other ways.<br />2)  Action and Story.  The fellowship, while still action packed, was more story oriented and less action (even more so in the novel). The Two Towers has tons more action, along with a great story to boot.  The battle at Helms Deep will be monumental for the silver screen (it will put most past epic battle sequences to shame, with the exception of Braveheart and a few others).  And for the mushy folk (and u few sentimental guys), the love story between Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Arwen (Liv Tyler)is still here (though not in the book, Peter Jackson's own addition).  Don't expect to be led into the story though.  It will jump right in, with no recap of the last movie.  Rent it again if you have to.<br />3)Three men.  Viggo Mortenson, Ian McKellen, and Elijah Wood.  These three stars are a driving force in these movies.  They give depth and meaning to these characters, that you can't help but be captivated when they're on the screen.  Not to mention Christopher Lee, who is absolutely menacing as Sauruman, and is an amazing bad guy.<br />4)  Those special effects.  Who wasn't terrified by those hideous Urak-Hai (however you spell them).  Now we have the CG created creatures Gollum, and Treebeard, both of whom play large roles in this movie.  These special effects will make you believe that everything goin on on the screen has actually happened.<br />So you've got all these great resons, so why shouldn't it be good.  Of course, I could be wrong, but of course Tiger Woods could never win another tournament the rest of his life.  Wht do you think?

0385484518|5.0|This memoir of a professor's last days is a small book, but its  lessons in living leave a big and lasting impression. Morrie Swartz had a hard childhood but he grew into a man who loved life. As a college professor, he always had a bonus for his students - a lesson in living.  He continued to enjoy every moment of life even while he watched himself die the slow death of Lou Gehrig's Disease. The author visited with his old professor Morrie every Tuesday during the last weeks of Morrie's life, and in recording their conversations, he allowed Morrie to leave a lesson plan in living for all of us. You'll not only want to read it again and again yourself, but you'll want to tell everybody you know to read it.

The Spider-man dvd menu could have been tweaked a little better and the outakes/casting auditions are pretty [bad].  However, the movie itself is great and the other bonus features such as the rogue gallary, the many loves of Peter Parker, and etc. do well to make it up.  <br />I know that a \\"Deluxe Spider-man\\" set is coming out but be warned!!!

B00003CXCD|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of classic movies, can take them or leave them, but came across this one night late and Audrey's brightness (that woman had screen presence) caught my eye.  Ended up staying up to watch it and have since bought the VHS and now the dvd to show others.<br />Point being, this is an excellent comedy and in my opinion Audrey's best work.  Breakfast at Tiffany's gets more attention, but in my opinion this movie is where Ms. Hepburn REALLY shined.  It's a cute romance, much comedy and excellent acting.  Guaranteed, you won't dislike this movie.
B000068TPN|5.0|The power of good acting is real characters, and this film is reality.  The expressions of excited young men going off to war, is stunningly altered into those bearing great shock, sorrow, and death.  The women they left at home portray the qualities of 1965 ladies supportive of their husbands, no matter what.<br />Madeline Stowe, as Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife, unites the wives left behind on the base.  When the Army is unprepared to hand deliver telegrams informing the family that their soldier died, she takes over the task from the cab company that had been hired to do so.  Each telegram is poignant, and I was reminded that every soldier, nurse, doctor, civilian, everyone has a story.<br />This one is about the American men who fought the first battle for God and country in Vietnam.  The film begins with a disclaimer that it is not a reflection of personal or political ideologies.  To me, that statement generally means the studio must distance itself to avoid potential ramifications about an unpopular war.  Also, that I am about to see more truth than fiction, more questions than answers.<br />We Were Soldiers is intense, and I could only watch it in short segments.  I needed time to think, to understand, and to witness the horror of battle.  It is vivid -- when bullets hit bodies, blood spews from the wounds.  Friendly fire kills, and is only called friendly because the man behind the bullet or bomb is in the same army.  Napalm burns whomever is in the path, and flesh is charred to the bone.  These are graphically displayed, and accounts for the \\"R\\" rating at the box office.<br />The reality, especially looking backwards at history and knowing these men and women came home without a hero's welcome, stirs me deeply.  Honor and integrity are shown along with \\"battle scenes once seen that can never be forgotten\\" in words such as \\"I will be the first one on the field and the last one to leave, and I will leave no man behind.\\"<br />Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) said he would never forgive himself because his men died and he did not in the La Drang Valley (the Valley of Death).  It is clear that in the end, soldiers fought to save each other as they obeyed orders.<br />We Were Soldiers, The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, Behind Enemy Lines, Blackhawk Down, Flight of the Intruder, Platoon, and so many others are very important films; they are about historical events.  To me, the message about warriors is that on the field there are never winners, only survivors.<br />Five Stars.<br />Victoria Tarranisaid he would never forgive himself because his men died and he did not in the La Drang Valley (the Valley of Death).

B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam have shown time and time again that they are not just a grunge knock-off band. From 'Vitalogy', to 'No Code' to those 72 live albums, they have put themselves in their own rock category, in which other [imitattion] bands(Creed, Default and a slew of others), have copied and yet have had more success than recent Pearl Jam records. <br />But take away the hype, and the 'fake-GRUNGE' motto, and you have a unique eclectic blend of artistry and uniquity that is 'Riot Act'. The boys of Pearl Jam have created an album worthy of being one of the best, or if not the best original rock record to come out this year. <br />Lyrics such as: \\"It's a disease...and they're all green/It emanates from their being/A satiation...with occupation\\"('Green Disease') show the band diving into themes that are more haunting. <br />'Riot Act' may not go platinum 10X over, but greatness is <BR>not determined by record sales.
B00006JSS8|5.0|A Motown equivalent of the Beatles &quot;#1&quot; collection -- all of Stevie Wonder's biggest hits gathered together on a single CD.  Of course, his 1970s masterpiece albums really have to be appreciated in their own right, but it's still great to sample Wonder's career and hear his transitions from an incredibly talented teenager into a true pop genius, and then into a veteran show biz star.  Nice set of music.
B00006M183|3.0|I am still waiting for Pearl Jam to release a GREAT album.<BR>If it wasn't for TEN, I would probably never have bought a PJ album.<BR>Not that I would like something that sounds like Ten, but something that has the intensity, the energy of their first effort.<BR>I don't think they have written a song since that first album, to me all the other albums they released since then sound the same, not bad not good, just flat almost has if PJ was afraid to take a step forward and reconsider their music.I had great hopes when Matt Cameron joined the band, I really though he would destructurize the beats, break the monotony, bring a new dimension to the music-like he did so well in Soundgarden...Nooops!<BR>But then again why would they if almost everybody gives them a 5 stars.<BR>I just think that they have a lot more to give than they do.
B000003N7G|5.0|John Coltrane is at his best on this recording.  Some people dislike it because they believe it is excessively serious, but to me it is deeply emotional and even joyful.  It really takes an open mind (and concentration) to enjoy this CD properly, but it will more than reward the listener for the energy he expends.  <BR>Musically, it would be absurd to attack this recording; the writing, improvisation, and interaction are flawless.  <BR>One word of warning: If you are someone who listens to music for simple entertainment or background, this is not the CD for you.  Listening to this CD in the background would be like reading yourself to sleep with James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot;.  <BR>It really boils down to how you see music.  Some people just don't think of music as being a deeply expressive artistic outlet, and that's fine - but they won't enjoy this CD.

0553208845|5.0|I read this book before I ventured out into the real world, and I read it again many years after I had returned from that world. After I read it, I wanted to kick myself for not learning more from it the first time.... But then, that is also covered in this story, Siddhartha's father could not protect him from the world, nor could Siddhartha protect his own son when the time came. You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /><br /> I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.

0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin is just a little boy.  He has a mom, a dad, a sister and a brother.  He plays with blocks, he goes to school.  He's six years old.  He's also a super-genius.<BR>Ender lives in a world still in shock from the impact of two alien invasions that a generation ago almost destroyed the human race.  All the media, even the games little children play reflect these attacks and Ender was created solely to be a military genius who can protect planet Earth from a third invasion by the aliens.<br />He's been sent to a military school in outer space where boys are trained to give up their childhood and become soldiers and commanders.  As Ender was bred to be the detached, powerful commander of this army of boys, he's not allowed to make friends or even socialize with the other children.  His teachers isolate him from the start, leaving him no outlet for human contact save as a leader in the war-games the students are trained through.  So ender throws his life into <BR>these games, winning them all and quickly becoming the greatest commander ever to train at the battle school.  He earns the awe and respect of all the boys at the school and becomes an unapproachable, god-like hero to all of them.  <br />Ender doesn't want to be a hero..  He wants to be a little boy who can laugh and cry and make mistakes.  But he knows this is impossible,  and he's miserable because of it.  He's willing to give up his life, though, for what he believes is the greater good of mankind.<br />As time goes on, however, he begins to suspect that there was much more to the historic alien invasions that he's been told through the propaganda everyone's been brainwashed with since birth.  Ender fears that perhaps the battle school is only a byproduct of a political power struggle back on Earth.  He's being forced to waste his life supposedly protecting his home planet from invasion by aliens when the real enemies may indeed be the humans who already inhabit it.  And the horrible truth is that there's nothing he can do about it.

0676973779|5.0|For many immigrants who arrived in Canada, a new life of economic prosperity seems to be the beacon that attracted them. However, for some smaller number of immigrants, like myself, arriving here felt like a happy chapter of a life mostly blanketed with sorrow, loneliness and utter helplessness. I had never read a book that related so well with my past. As you read it, you will be taken on an incredible adventure that out does many if not all \\"castaway\\" movies and stories you may have seen or read. We may have read about survivors floating on a lifeboat after loosing their entire family to a ship accident and encountering all kinds of terrible things and places, some funny some deadly. Here, it is not these that matter. What matters in Mr. Martel's &#8220;Life of Pi&#8221; is how can we all discover, like Martel&#8217;s young hero Piscene Molitor Patel (Pi) does, that deep in each of us there really is God, Allah, Yahweh, Love, Hope, Christianity, Islam, Szerelem (Hungarian), Sevgi ve Umut (Turkish), Amal (Arabic), Arzu (Farsi), or whatever else your label may be, its a Good Thing. As I started the book, excitement of a beautiful spring rain bathed my senses, as I turned to the last page, I wept tears of joy. I will read this book again. I recommend that you do too. You will be surprised how much goodness you have inside. Take this book with you on your next voyage (beyond your supermarket, city, town, country), it will not only keep you company like Richard Parker does Pi, but it well help you go on living even if life seems to have handed out it last thread of hope.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I've just finished my first listen, and was just totally blown away.  It will be interesting to see what long-term Opeth fans have to say, since I only discovered the band a couple of months ago.

I used to be a pop music lover and that was all i listened to and then i listened to one step closer and it wasnt to much screaming for me or to hard core to turn me off from it and then Crawling came out and i was changed i immediately bought the cd and loved it! they are so different then other rock music. and people have to realize that they are not just rock music they are a blend. they do not sound like Limp Bizkit! They are totally original and care about there fans. There not posers or manfactured they wrote music from there heart and the lyrics actually make some sence besides them saying Im gonna rip your head off. I will give you my word on the tracks<br />1. Papercut- This is an awesome song! It has great beats and Mike has some great fast raps i would give this song a 9/10<br />2. One step closer- An awesome song with really cool guitar riffs and a good point for people out there! 8/10<br />3. With You- This song is Great!!! It has good raps and chester has a great voice. Hes so talented!9/10<br />4. Points Of Authority-  I love this song and it has really good raps beats and verses, definately a good song 9/10<br />5. Crawling- This is definately one of my favorite songs cauze i could relate to it at one point and chesters voice and lyrics helped me throught that phase 10/10<br />6. Runaway- A really good songs but not one of my favs. But still i dont skip over it so its great! 8/10<br />7. By Myself- This song is awesome its really cool at the start and Mikes raps go so well with chesters singing one of my fav songs 9/10<br />8. In the End - AWESOME SONG!!! this is soooooooooo good the lyrics are awesome its just great one of the best on this album! 10/10<br />9. A Place for My head- spectacular song. definately one you can take your anger out on if your pissed off at the world 10/10<br />10. Forgotten- This is such a good song! It was my fav at a time its so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10<br />11. Cure for the itch- pretty interesting song but i usually skip over it since it has no lyricz but it is pretty good 7/10<br />12. Pushing me away- Ok... this is an awesome song! I mean it has great lyricz great beats and by now your in love with chester and his voice this song wraps up the cd and leaves u with an expression that makes u look like a goast your so blown away (well at least for me) 10/10<br />Overall this is the BEST cd in the world! I suggest u get it.. if u dont you'll be sorry
B00006IU73|2.0|Porcupine Tree keeps with the Pink Floyd tradition of guitar-dominated progressive. Keyboards are used abundantly, but as accompaniment or accent. Such as the voice mellotron used as intro to \\"Gravity Eyelids\\". With most prog, you know the material would sound unfinished if you didn't have somebody at least playing old-fashioned Hammond and piano--after all, prog wasn't always done with synthesizers and mellotron. With the material here, you know you could pick up your old six-string and do it passably. It sounds even better if you use your accoustic. There's a what-if here--what would Genesis have been like if Steve Hackett or Anthony Phillips had led them?<br />Now comes the downside. You can't play this disc on your CD-rom drive. With me that's no biggie--I'm still enough of a dinosaur to own CD players that just spin the disc and make the music come out of my speakers. But I personally know a lot of people who use their stereos only for their LPs and tapes and buy a comp with a humongous hard drive for their CDs. Okay, I know what you're going to say. The record companies and artists have do do something about online piracy. Maybe that makes this disc the first copy-proof disc in my collection, I don't know. But this disc goes that one better. You can't play \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" as an individual track, the player gets hung up when you try. You can't program your player to play the number out of sequence. You are only permitted to play that song coming out of the one before it--\\"The Sound Of Muzak\\". I don't think I've got a defective disc--they sent me a replacement and it pulled the same stunt. You know, it's ironic. One of the arguments used to trash the original generation of prog was that it was in violation of the basic spirit of rock'n'roll--the spirit of having fun. Instead, they told us, the \\"art rock\\" crowd tried to reimpose the stodgy values of skillful musicianship as found in jazz and classical upon rock audiences. As such, the argument went on, the Establishment was taking over rock in the 1970s after failing to destroy it in the 1950s, using the art rock bunch as their Fifth Column. In conclusion, populism was the cornerstone of rock'n'roll, and the \\"art rock\\" bunch were contaminating it with elitism. Pure garbage, to be sure. But here I've been rhapsodizing for over a decade over the return of prog with a new generation of bands like Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, the Flower Kings and Spock's Beard. And Porcupine Tree decides that they have the right make up rules governing how their audience will listen to their music.ishment was taking over rock in the 1970s after failing to destroy it in the 1950s, using the art rock bunch as their Fifth Column.

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is one of the rare bands who can mix up alternative,metal,hip-hop perfectly.Besides having 2 incredible good singers,the band manages  to combine pervading guitar riffs to their songs without lowering their 2 frontmans' abilities.What is really striking is the maturity of this album.The lyrics are extraodinary and you can easily relate to them.The melodies are astonishing as well as the DJ's amazing stuff.You'll hear it if you buy the album.They have made the perfect start and i pray that it is not the last.An absolute album for beginners and metal true fans.
0151008116|5.0|For many immigrants who arrived in Canada, a new life of economic prosperity seems to be the beacon that attracted them. However, for some smaller number of immigrants, like myself, arriving here felt like a happy chapter of a life mostly blanketed with sorrow, loneliness and utter helplessness. I had never read a book that related so well with my past. As you read it, you will be taken on an incredible adventure that out does many if not all \\"castaway\\" movies and stories you may have seen or read. We may have read about survivors floating on a lifeboat after loosing their entire family to a ship accident and encountering all kinds of terrible things and places, some funny some deadly. Here, it is not these that matter. What matters in Mr. Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" is how can we all discover, like Martel's young hero Piscene Molitor Patel (Pi) does, that deep in each of us there really is God, Allah, Yahweh, Love, Hope, Christianity, Islam, Szerelem (Hungarian), Sevgi ve Umut (Turkish), Amal (Arabic), Arzu (Farsi), or whatever else your label may be, its a Good Thing. As I started the book, excitement of a beautiful spring rain bathed my senses, as I turned to the last page, I wept tears of joy. I will read this book again. I recommend that you do too. You will be surprised how much goodness you have inside. Take this book with you on your next voyage (beyond your supermarket, city, town, country), it will not only keep you company like Richard Parker does Pi, but it well help you go on living even if life seems to have handed out it last thread of hope.
B00004W510|5.0|I have almost 1,000 CDs and this may be the one that has found it's way onto my player the most over the past 15 years.  The songs just don't &quot;wear out&quot;.  I recently got a copy of the remastered version.  The alternate takes are great and the additional liner material alone makes it worth the &quot;upgrade&quot;.  <br />Shared this with a friend of mine who is 20 yrs. younger than I am and had never even heard of The Band.  She wasn't quite sure what to think at first (not like the current teenie fare), but after a couple of listens another CD was sold.  Pass this one on to a friend.
B000066NW0|5.0|I have read in an exclusive magazine article that she says she is not punk and she is not trying to be punk. She's at least a better role model and more real then Britney Speared or Christina Gagulera.
0399229191|5.0|Lovely book with all the barnyard friends.  Great way to get your child to participate by having them make the animal sound.  Also, the illustrations are raised so there is a three-dimensional feel to them.  We thoroughly enjoy Eric Carle books in our house and you can't go wrong with this one!
B00005QXDD|4.0|This CD was wrong in every way...so if you're a Black fan you'll love it. I was surprised at the fact he actually is a serious musician, he just has a sick sense of humor. It took a while, but most of the tracks eventually grew on me. I was expecting more of a true &quot;Sandler-ish&quot; comedy CD, but have been pleased. I only give it a 4 because it isn't something that I would &quot;rock-out&quot; to, but it's not a true &quot;comedy-CD&quot;. It's just fun to listen to over some beers.
B000066NW0|2.0|Ok, at first, I really liked her. She was a new voice for a new generation, she's so Anti-Britney, which made everyone love her. But after a while, things get old. About 4 or 5 times a day I hear this on the radio \\"Uh huh....life's like this...uh huh uh huh that's the way it is\\" Do you know how annoying that is? And the same with Sk8er Boi. And then there's the thing about how she always wears ties and dresses like a guy. What is she, a hermaphrodite? Would it kill her to not wear a tie? I mean seriously. It's like how Alicia Keys always wore her hair in braids, it gets old, and drives me crazy, but I actually like Alicia Keys. I think Avril needs a break. I mean, I'm just so sick of her. She should back off and let other people who talent sing. There are talented people out there who are hardly ever heard. Like Kay Hanley or Nina Gordon. But, who am I to say anything
630575067X|5.0|This movie is great, ecspecially the action scenes (The podrace, lightsaber fight, etc...) Liam Nelson and Ewan Mgweger were extrimly good, and i ecspecially like the relationship the shared. The young Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) was performed extrimly well, we can all expect him to show up in many later movies which I am excited about.
0375414053|5.0|There are few books that can make a reader laugh out loud, or reach for a cellphone to call the kids just to make sure they were okay.  \\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" is one such book.  As a former full-time working mother, it was easy for me to relate to her feelings of guilt over time she spent with her kids, anger at not having the home in perfect working order, frustration over her deteriorating relationship with her husband, and excitement over the thrill of a budding email romance.<br />Some critics call the story a fairy tale-- but it could be no further than the truth for me:  it was the story of my life, as well as the lives of more than a few of my friends.  The book may not be for everyone, but it certainly touches a chord with those of us women who dared to dream of having it all-- a high-profile job, gorgeous husband and children.  ...
B0000029AL|4.0|Most classic bands had to make a few albums before recording their most epic anthem, but Aerosmith did it on their debut -- the timeless \\"Dream On.\\" This song alone is worth the price of admission, despite being overplayed by rock radio the past few decades. But this record has much more -- seven minutes of white-boy funk on \\"One Way Street,\\" lead singer Steve Tyler and guitar-slinger Joe Perry's first co-composition, (and autobiography of the band's early days) \\"Movin' Out,\\" and a tasty cover of Rufus Thomas' \\"Walkin' The Dog.\\"<br />While the band would go on to bigger and better things (Toys In The Attic, Rocks) before selling out in the late '80s and '90s, there are still some great tracks here: album-opener \\"Make It\\" gets things started in grand style, and live staple \\"Mama Kin\\" proves itself worthy of Tyler's tattoo and Guns 'n' Roses' cover a decade and a half later. Even the lesser tracks \\"Somebody\\" and \\"Write Me A Letter\\" rock with such style and attitude that the album demands attention.<br />To dismiss early Aerosmith as mere Stones clones is to not realize the obvious difference between Jagger's British sensibility and Tyler's greasy U.S. attitude and Keith's sloppy open-G tuning and Perry's standard guitar onslaught. This debut sounds like a band that's lived a lot, on both sides of the coin. Worth every penny.
0028643151|5.0|I rarely read non-fiction, but read this book because I've read this author's previous four novels.<br />Whoa.  This book keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is incredibly scary because everything the author writes about could really happen.  And concepts that are normally difficult for me to grasp were made understandable.<br />Whoa again.  Come on, Mr. Moran, write another novel!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Thinkg this was only for children I came in with low expectations left with anew favorite movie. Harry Potter tells the story of a young boy who doesnt realize it yet but is a great wizard. When he gets to Hogwarts academy for wizards extrimly strange things begin to happen, including a evil uncle which wants to destroy Harry for good. I am excited about the new one to see what will happen next.
B000001Y2U|3.0|To quote the people who say that this is one of the darkest albums around. This is most definitely not the darkest album around. If you are looking for stuff that is hardcore and pre Evil, check out metal bands like Emperor, Cradle of Filth and Dark Throne, which Manson is pop in comparison to. On the other hand, this is a great album of whatever you want to call it (and no, it is not industrial). Has some great combinations of Metal guitar, drumming and raspy vocals. I find that in some of the songs Manson gets a bit side-tracked, which ruins the song and makes it sound bland.
B00000JLWW|5.0|... This is a movie about the historic Titanic sinking...everything but that is secondary!!!<br />For that breathtaking depiction alone, this film deserves 5 stars. Before this movie, I had never comprehended the horrific fate of this ship and her passengers. This was a HORROR movie to me! Like watching Psycho the second time...you know what's going to to happen to Janet Leigh and you just wait...tick tock, tick tock!<br />Knowing what was inevitable made this movie rock for me...who cares if these actors can act? To me they are just figures on a giant chess board...who survives and who doesn't is the guessing game.<br />Meanwhile, sit back and watch an amazing recreation of the sinking of the unsinkable. No question: Director Cameron was the right man for this job.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This musical score is brilliant. The songs are beyond words. The moods swing from cheerful and bright to dark and haunting. I get chills every time I listen to this. Howard Shore is a great composer who really captured the music of Middle-earth. Enya's songs really add a wonderful Elvish lilt to some of the songs, especially the last one, which has me teared up every time. Although I love all of the songs, I have to say my favorite is &quot;The Bridge of Khazhad-dum&quot; The deep bass with the low voices over it wonderfully portray the danger and adrenaline that is happening in that particular scene. When the music stops- WoW! You can get very caught up in the emotions of the music. I can't wait until the soundtrack for The Two Towers comes out. I can go on and on, but I won't bore you. So, as the Elves say,<BR> Namarie! ( Farewell)
0316666343|4.0|This is one of the more well written books I've read lately.  However, it remains a little odd as to why the bad guy eventually got his due via an \\"icicle\\"...  Regardless...a must read.  Enjoy.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the band Opeth ever since I read a review of their album Orchid in an underground metal mag. I finally found myself a copy,and I've been hooked on them since. As a long time fan,I can honestly say this album is one that took the longest to grow on me. I was kind of disappointed at first,maybe I was setting the bar too high. After many subsequent listenings,the album started to reveal itself,and I was finding the songs and textures much deeper then I orginally thought. I would recommend this album to anyone. One of Opeths finest. The song Deliverance is one of the cds high points. This is absolute classic Opeth. One of the best things on this album is Martin Lopez. Good god,this is some serious drumming. Anyone into metal dummers would do themselves a favor by picking up this CD. He is incredible. The musicianship as a whole is excellent as usual,and the production by Porcupine Trees Steve Wilson,is amazing. As I said earlier in the review,this album didnt hit me straight in the head like some of the earlier Opeth albums,but it had a huge payoff once I got it. Give it a try,and give it a chance to sink into you brain. So many people do not let things sink in,and rush to judgement,then miss out on the big picture. Enjoy.
B00002E224|5.0|I stumbled on this movie (just like everybody else it seems) some years ago on TV. I read the content and thought 'Oh looks nice'. And how nice it was. I was completely speechless! I have never seen such an intense and true movie! The idea of Richard Linklater to tell his story to the world is just great. He once met a women and the walked around all night, just talking... When he visited Vienna for a movie-festival he felt it was the right place to re-enact hiStory. I like the conversations between Hawke and Delpy, the way the talk about nothing but still touch the essence of life... magnificent! My first thoughts? 'This is life.' I hope you all enjoy it the same way I did!
0151008116|5.0|I finished the book in no time, couldn't take my eyes off the pages! The humor has a touch of Mark Twain, but much sweeter. Pi's adventure is told in an extremely powerful way. I felt like I was THERE on the lifeboat with him and Richard Parker. The ending left me deeply perplexed and somewhat awestruck. I would highly recommend this book. It's one of those everlasting works of literature that leave you breathless.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko mangages to achieve something akin to cold-fusion - the absurd yet necessary confusion of tragedy and triumph, beauty and the grotesque. This is a vital film, especially for anyone who thinks they know the nature of despair. Life is beautiful and if you don't think so, then go do something to make the necessary changes - add your own brush strokes. There's enough room on the canvass, for Franks's sake!
B00006G8LB|4.0|the movie was good, the actors were really good yet the ending was very very very dissapointing. Because it really ruins the relationship between Kirsten Dunst and ahem... Tobey Maguire:)!But as far as the story goes it was pretty good. A lot better than I thought it would be!  I really recommend this to action fans, fans of the comics but I think romance fans...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................this might be ok every once in a while but I wouldn't check it out like every week because the romcance part is kindof depressing. BECAUSE HE DUMPS HER IN THE END THE WOMAN HE LOVES!AND THE WOMAN WHO LOVES HIM BACK!! I FIND THAT THE STUPIDEST THING SPIDER-MAN COUD'VE EVER DONE IN THIS ENTIRE MOVIE!. So as you can see it kinda dissapointed me at all cost as a die-hard romance fan I was kinda dissapointed yet kindof satisfied.
B00005K9QP|5.0|All right, John Mayall and Eric Clapton are white and British. But who cares, as long as they play as soulfully and rawly as in this album? <BR>After the publishing of this record, there were spontaneous paintings on the walls of London procclaiming 'Clapton is God'. Understandably. In my opinion, he's never played as intensely as in this album, except for his brief stint at Derek & the Dominoes. (Guitarists might be interested in the fact that Eric was playing a Gibson Les Paul through a Marshall amp at that time.)<BR>The covers of Freddie King's songs are exceptional and the sound of the album is very much 'british 60s'. Mayall is obviously not as good a singer as Muddy Waters, but he's undoubtedly one of the best bandleaders in the world and knows how to get the maximum out of his musicians. <BR>I must have heard this record more than a thousand times and almost know it by heart. It ignited in me an unstoppable desire to play blues guitar and buy everything related to Clapton and Mayall. Now I know how to play 'Hideaway's guitar part by heart... So beware if you buy this album, it is likely to turn you into a die-hard blues fanatic. At least that's what it did with me.
B000067CPX|5.0|When the Red Hot Chili Peppers released Californication in 1999, many people said how they had changed and they were no longer the band that they were...well they were right, and By the Way basically seals the deal. They are no longer the immature funk band that gave such albums as The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, they are now a middle aged rock band, with their focus on vocal harmonies and playing for the song and not to impress, now i'm by no means saying that they dumbed down their playing for this album, because their music is still impossible to emulate, they just have a different style of playing. The album opens with the title track and first single, By the Way, sounds like an outtake off of Californication, figures why it would be the first single. This album holds many differnt styles such as the 60's pop sounding Universally Speaking, the acoustic Don't Forget Me, and the ballads I Could Die for You and Midnight, the latter being one of the strongest songs on the album. They also have some funk inspired songs such as Can't Stop which is great and Throw Away Your Television which is not so great, probably the weakest song on the album. For the most part the band is more mellow and moody now then they ever were, songs like Warm Tape and Doesd show this. Dosed also features guitarist John Frusciante singing as well as Anthony Kiedis, which gives the song a great effect. The harmonies on this album are definately some of the best i've heard in my life. They also have the psychadelic pop of The Zephyr Song which is also the latest single and one of the best songs on the album as well as the ska influenced Lemon Trees On Mercury, and the Californication inspired Minor Thing which is one of the best rock songs i've ever heard. The album closes with Venice Queen which is a total masterpiece, definately don't overlook this song because it starts slow. This album in my opinion is the perfect showcase for where the Chili Peppers are at right now,Anthony Kiedis' vocals are more powerful then they've ever been, John's guitar playing is amazing as usual, but im tempted to say better than ever, also tempted to say that this is his album, Flea's bass playing is great, not that i needed to say that, and Chad's drums are very powerful and compliment the songs very well, this is definately a must own album, from one of the greatest bands of our time.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Chocolat (French word for Chocolate - for those not linguistically endowed) is a charming movie which leaves you feeling good about life (no matter how much it sucks in reality!). It is based on a novel of the same name by a not-so-well-known writer Joanne Harris.<br />Based in a small french town, the movie charts the life of Vianne Rocher and her young daughter Anouck and her imaginary pet kangaroo pantoufle. Vianne and her (apparently) out-of-wedlock daughter move into this town and set up a chocolaterie (a chocolate shop) much to the dismay of the orthodox inhabitants. Vianne is opposed by most of the town dwellers, especially the mayor who considers it blasphemous to even think about chocolate in the traditional month of abstinence for the christians - Lent.<br />The movie is about how Vianne slowly wins over the townfolk with her 'customised' chocolates and coffee and by caring / listening to others and helping them. The movie stars the extremely attractive Juliette Binoche, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp in a pretty different role. The film is a 'Life is beautiful' kind of movie that leaves you with a lump in the throat and reassured that all is not wrong with this world.
B00005RY7X|5.0|The thing with Andrew W.K. is either you love him or you hate him, there's really no in between, and odds are if you hate him you just don't get it, he's not out to make technically proficient music or write moving lyrics, he's out to party and have a good time. Without even hearing the songs you can figure that out by just looking at the titles. Essentially every song sounds the same but in my opinion it's not a bad thing. Album opens with It's Time to Party, perfect song to open an album with, short catchy and to the point. That song is followed by first single / breakout song Party Hard, it is just about letting loose and have a good time. Girls Own Love and Redy to Die follow, their cut from the same mold as the previous two songs and the rest of the album as a matter of fact. Girls Own Love was actually an old song called Girls Own Juice that he rerecorded for I Get Wet. One of the standout tracks on the album is I Love New York City, it's an ode to NYC that was actually written before September 11th, unlike other \\"tributes\\" The current single She is Beautiful follows, this is definately the best song on the album, everything about it is perfect. Fun Night and Take it Off like every other song are amazing and sound alike. Another standout track on the album is Party Til You Puke, yes he does have the word party in 3 song titles on the album. The album closes with Don't Stop Livin in the Red, which actually sounds somewhat different from the other songs. This album is amazing, believe it or not, personally I think it's worth it, but then again it's just my opinion
B0000640VO|5.0|It's an excellent movie, the approach to our lives of the real<BR>world is no doubt wonderful and unique. The music is the best<BR>I have ever heard in movies. And this movie truly provides a <BR>way for us to forget about the subjective and objective divisions<BR>in daily reality.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Because this is geniunely a great album. If I had to judge the band based on their mod &quot;too cool for you attitudes&quot;, I wouldnt give it a chance. But the songs to creep into your head and establish themselves as relevant. Worth the purchase.
0316666343|5.0|I thought this book was moving, sentimental, heartwrenching, chilling, soul-moving, and heartbreaking but inspirational. Best of all, like the book \\"West Point..\\" by Norman Thomas Remick (another \\"heavenly\\" type book every American should try not to miss), Alice Sebold uses that unique and fascinating presentational format that has made \\"The Lovely Bones\\" a bestseller. The Sebold book has received a wild variety of comments and ratings here on Amazon.com. Personally, I think many are unfairly too critical. But, all I can say is, read it, and judge for yourself.

0316286850|5.0|Like most women, I learnt my make-up tips here and there.  The book is well made with loads of pictures.  No matter how clueless you are about make-up you will learn because he breaks the make-uping process into easy to follow steps, he gives many different examples and useful tips.  By the way, after using his advice, I was given complements by people who normally don't.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is awesome!  If you loved the episode, then you will love this CD as well.  Not only does it have all the songs from the episode but it also has the music from episodes like Hush, Restless, and The Gift.  If you don't know the words to the songs then they have all the words in the booklet.  The last song is Joss Whedon and his wife singing &quot;Life's A Show&quot;.  It is a great CD so I recommend it for anybody who loved the episode &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot;!

B00006M183|5.0|Amazon.com should not give people the opportunity to review pearl jam albums until 15 days after their release. I hated this album so much when I listened through it the first couple of times. It sounded boring and lifeless. Then suddenly I was hit by one song, then two three..... These are the songs that can last you a lifetime! The album has grown on me now and I cannot stop listening to it! Every song is beyond great! (except for 'get right') Listen to this album carefully before you judge it! It is a classic if you give it a chance! Songs like 'you are', 'love boat captain' 'thumbing my way' and 'all or none' are something really special. <br />I am also deeply impressed by how the album came together. Most of the songs that ended up in here are first takes! That proves just how good these guys are.. The songs will be even greater live! Excellent effort Pearl Jam.
B00005N83M|1.0|I feel the same as just about everyone here.  While Jlow is a competent actress, in my opinion, she couldn't carry a note in a bucket.  In addition, I think it is incredibly low of her to sing &quot;I'm Real&quot; then to find out that Ashanti sang the hook and they put in Jlow's voice with it later to make her sound good, because again, (in my opinion) she couldn't carry a note in a bucket.  That is NOT real.  Sorry. I was proud of her too, as a fellow Hispanic woman, and thought that she was finally giving her all into her music, then I felt like I was duped.  I guess she's still acting, even when she sings.  Just one listener's opinion.
B000002KON|5.0|Fantastic! My fav Kinks album is &quot;Village Greeen Preservation Society,&quot; but this is my next fav (then &quot;Something Else,&quot; &quot;Muswell Hillbiles,&quot; &quot;Face to Face,&quot; Lola...&quot; and The BBC). The songs are terrific and Dave has all of the best guitar licks.  I can't recommend this album enough.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album really is deserving of 5 starts. I don't normally write reviews, when I saw that this album dropped to 4.5 stars, I decided to make an exception. Not only is the music amazing, but the lyrics are an even greater strength. It is a theme album (like Dark Side of the Moon), and you should definately give it a few listens while looking at lyric sheets (sometimes it's hard to make out what Tom's saying). This is my favorite album, and I think it truly deserves the mark I am giving it.
B00006F7S4|3.0|Frank Sinatra's 1976 recording of \\"Send In The Clowns\\" opens with a few words of introduction that explain the story of a dissolving relationship to follow. \\"Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant\\", Sinatra says. \\"It's a breakup\\". The same sentiment could introduce Beck's new Sea Change, a breakup album where bowed heads replace pointed fingers. Somber by anyone's standards, especially compared to the infectious plastic funk of 1999's Midnite Vultures, Sea Change puts a tight close-up on the final days of a good relationship gone bad.<br />Working again with Nigel Godrich, producer of the similarly delicate but otherwise divergent Mutations, Beck swaddles the hurt in a lush assortment of elements that would sound like Babel under anyone else's direction. Steel guitars meet Morricone strings, and beneath it all, Beck sings the blues. Sea Change was reportedly written in a heat following the end of a long relationship, and it sounds like it. The disc takes a heartbroken stretch of days and compresses them down to album size, in a way that might have sounded oppressive in its self-pity if Beck were any less assured. These songs come from a cul de sac: The reasons for going there can no longer be articulated, and the only way out is the path that led in. For all the typically diverse influences, these songs are simple in a way that the artist's past efforts have only suggested. \\"I'm tired of fighting, fighting for a lost cause\\", goes a line repeated throughout \\"Lost Cause\\", going past the accusations and the anger to the sadness beneath. It's a breakup, after all. <br />Beck knows what Sinatra and Sondheim knew before him: No matter who failed whom, the sadness is always what remains. Sometimes, it even gets turned into music of disquieting beauty.
6305350205|1.0|William Shatner has succeeded where so many others have failed. He has supplanted Ed Wood as the worst director of all time. Of course this is no surprise, he is the one weak link in the entire Star Trek legacy and Tim Allen's parody of him as a blowhard was right on the money. Avoid this movie at all costs. Resistance is not futile.
038533348X|4.0|This is Vonnegut's commentary on the 20th century - from overreliance on science and its callousness to religion and how political mismanagement makes spiritual revivals necessary.  Best of all, Vonnegut is clever and thought-provoking chapter after chapter.  His ideas, while they may not seem seminal today, are ever-important.<br />The story is based on a writer's research for a book cocnerning the dropping of the atom bomb.  Vonnegut's roots in scientific curioisity are everywhere in his writings, and crucial here.  He creates his comical cast of characters around the story of the atom bomb's fictional father - his midgit son, a 3rd world dictator, American imperialist, a former Nazi physician trying to expiate his sins, and a number of scientists, each defective in his own way and each unwilling to embrace moral responsibility to society.<br />Vonnegut's narrative flows like a biblical text that is seemingly frivolous, yet seems to tackle serious subjects with the utmost gravity.  This is vintage Vonnegut - tackling human weakness and tragedy with satire.
B00003Q43A|2.0|Ah...1996. It seems as if it were only yesterday. But it's a world away from the cynical, fearful, paranoid, and oppressive times we live in now. ID4 would be rightfully laughed out of cinemas in the present day.<br /><br />America, pulsating infectious positive vibes with its booming economy, popular President running for re-election, a summer crammed with iconic, action-packed adventures such as The Rock, Mission: Impossible, and Eraser, all while riding high the wave of the Atlanta Olympics, naturally turned ID4 into the biggest hit of the decade. I must admit, I too was suckered into it.<br /><br />Why do I say suckered? I recall being amazed by the teaser trailer before a screening of Broken Arrow on April 13th, a full 4 months before the release (we had to wait until August 9th in the UK). It promised a dark, scary, and serious film about interstellar war. Then, as we got closer, a new trailer synced to the theme of Crimson Tide came out, mesmerizing audiences with then revolutionary visual effects.<br /><br />When the film was finally released the dark, scary, and serious film that we were promised across the entire ad campaign quickly descended into camp, corny, stupid nonsense. It's easy to make a terrible film and entertain the masses with flickering images and bright, pretty colors even if it doesn't make a shred of sense. How else would you account for the success of Michael Bay? ID4 is bad across the board. The dialogue is just awful, I cringe at every other line. Despite the fact that an end-of-the-world scenario is potentially very dramatic there is no real acting in the film at all. Each and every one of the actors speak like they're reading from cue cards being held beside the static camera. Will Smith's irregular ad-libbing is irritating and dates the film even further. Bill Pullman, as much as I like him, stumbles through the film like he's drunk and/or unable to understand English.<br /><br />Principal photography for ID4 wrapped in well under 3 months. I blame the swift shoot for the obvious lack of rehearsals and decent performances. It's like Roland Emmerich got the film in the can as quickly as possible at the expense of everything that might actually make it worthwhile. His non-effort results in almost the entire film being made of static shots with no hand-held camera movements whatsoever, which castrates ID4 of any sense of urgency or realism. Even the extras are bad, which is pretty sad considering all they have to do is run away from very fake explosions. If they didn't work for free then the production was ripped off.<br /><br />There's not one likable character. The second round of promos sold it as a Will Smith movie. It's not. He's really a secondary character in a cast filled with secondary characters. The worst subplot features Randy Quaid as a drunk pilot. Whenever the film cuts to his family (and his very annoying, moody, Keanu Reeves lookalike son) it threatens to keel over and die. Emmerich really ought to have been a bit more liberal with the scissors. It's astonishing to think that his director's cut is even longer. As if it were not already too bloated and clumsy.<br /><br />Of all the would-be greatness, only David Arnold's rousing score truly entertains. Though if your very geeky like me you'll realize that it's merely a plagiarism of Richard Joseph's theme to [[ASIN:B00002SUKL James Pond 3: Operation Starfish]].<br /><br />Worth watching only as a curious, outdated relic of an innocent time long since gone. ID4's enjoyment has long since expired.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a pretty good 1080p 2.35:1 picture (of the theatrical cut) with DTS HD-MA sound. Only a few of the extras from the DVD have been ported over.for the obvious lack of rehearsals and decent performances.

055352626X|4.0|Bill Bryson's &quot;I'm a Stranger...&quot; is an interesting collection of observations and comments about several aspects of American life.  As they are taken from weekly columns he wrote for a paper in England, this is not a &quot;book&quot; per se.  But that fact doesn't take away from its charm, or, at times, stinging criticism.<br />This is mostly a humorous work, like the article Bryson wrote poking fun at the US Federal Tax Return (wait 'til you hear it!).  But it's not all light-hearted; Bryson also finds time for more serious matters, like immigration and gun control.  His analyses of these situations and his expose' of inconsistent American values/beliefs is worth the price of the book alone.  Sometimes it takes an outsider, like Bryson was, to show you things you couldn't see yourself.  He does this splendidly.<br />Others have commented that the book was a little too formulaic; I have noticed this too.  Many of the articles end with a &quot;punch-line&quot; of sarcasm, and it seemed a bit predictable the more I read.  For this reason I would recommend not reading too much at once.  It worked better for me listening to one or two themes at a time, and then taking a break.  The material (and Bryson's approach) remained more fresh that way.<br />In all, though, this was a good effort.  Bryson definitely makes you think about issues you might have taken for granted.  Four stars.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|How gloriously camp this drivel is. Remember Riverdance and Lord Of The Dance and how everyone thot it was so cool at the time? The same applies to this movie. And the story is up to very little indeed, in fact it is like Grease mixed with Luhrmann's version of R+J. A man and a woman fall in love. Wow! THAT'S never been done before! Very weak and totally unoriginal.<br />This should have seriously just been a Broadway hit and not a big screen hit. But, of course, if every critic and every woman who sees this with all of her girlfriends likes it and if they rave about how good it is because everyone else says it is great and they only went to see it because people are telling them that it is a great movie (apparently a fact, not an opinion!) then they are only going to watch the great movie that it everyone says that it is. Me? I just watch the movie for what it is. No bias or pre-movie opinions. And what I saw was a stinker.<br />Almost everything in this movie seems so forced and shoved in our faces. Every shot is cluttered with overly decorated sets, too many occurrences and detail to register with us in 2 seconds cuts, heinously bad dubbing that is about as unconvincing as Orson Welles masquerading as Mickey Mouse, VERY bad CGI that Luhrmann seems to be in love with and too many androgynous and weird looking characters.<br />This film is all visual, or, if I were unoriginal (like the movie) I would say all style and no substance. Take away the indulgent and increasingly annoying sets/backdrops and all the stupid jumping around and dancing and you are left with what? A tedious movie that is good only because people say it is good. Another victim of `Insider Syndrome'.<br />For me, every set in a movie should, at the same time, be realistic and reflect tone and mood of the scene. EVERY-SINGLE-SET in Moulin Rouge is overly-decorated to the point that we cannot tell what the set is. They are and eyesore, ugly to look at and extremely garish. A representation of everything this movie stands for: indulgence, ego, campiness and pointless extravagance.<br />Lowest marks sorry. Oh and one last thing; how come no one speaks French in this France?<br />The self-important features contained on this DVD only reflect the attitude of the film even further.ything this movie stands for: indulgence, ego, campiness and pointless extravagance. <br />Lowest marks sorry.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|One of my favorite movies! The acting is excellent, the plot, fantastic. A quirky little independent movie with a lot of heart, and some really engaging music. Don't miss the main song, &quot;I am calling you...&quot; An extremely moving and beautiful song... it will stay with you, as will this movie. Super cute.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|That's what you'll be thinking while you watch this film. Donnie Darko is the best movie you've never heard about. As others have said, it's hard to classify: funny, confusing, disturbing, odd, and imaginative all rolled into one. But nicely done, keeping your interest and making you wonder where things are going and what will happen next. Jake Gyllenhaal is cute and pensive; he could be mistaken as a brother to Toby Maguire. Watch the DVD extras; the deleted scene commentaries shed some light on a few things. But you'll probably not completely &quot;get&quot; this movie, which is part of its charm since you'll keep thinking about it for days after seeing it.
B00005QZWI|3.0|At first, I really likes this CD.  Then i kept listening.  Its not that the CD gets worse at it goes along, its that it never changes.  The music is terrific, and I absolutely loved the movie.  But the music alone is just too repetitive.  Every song is a varation of a few musical themes.  It only gets worse with age, to the point where i can only listen to one or two songs at a time and only every so often before they become repetitive and annoying.  Although its really beautiful music, is distroys itself with its lack of variety from song to song.
0380789035|5.0|After enjoying Gaiman's Sandman comics and novels like Stardust and Neverwhere, I started reading American Gods with preconceived notions that Gaiman was a very skilled writer.  Yet again, I was not dissapointed... Gaiman is most definitely my favorite author and one of the most interesting in the industry today.<br />American Gods is a book unlike any other I have ever read.  The center idea of the novel is that of the lives of Gods.  What happens to Gods when people stop believing in them?  Are they real, and do they live lives?  Gaiman puts forth the notion that Gods live among us, are immortal, and go about their daily lives just as we do.  From Ibis to Odin, and from Horus to Thor, Gaiman characterizes well-known Gods as enigmatic and real-life people.  But where the real drama plays out is the conflict between Gods.<br />Shadow, the main character, has just been released from jail when he finds out his wife has been in an accident.  Soon, he meets Wednesday, a shady and powerful figure who persuades Shadow to drink the honey-wine of the Gods.  From this point on, Shadow's life drastically changes.  He is thrown into the often strange and mystical happenings of defunct Gods who have come to America to live.  These Gods hold odd jobs, and are trying to lay low in the culture of America.  Shadow must take on great responsibilities when a conflict arises between the Gods, and it is no piece of cake.<br />I love this book for a few reasons.  It has a very defined beginning, middle, and end, and the tension continues to mount throughout the novel until it reaches a epic climax of Shakespearian proportions.  The ending is what makes this book.  The various plot directions mysteriously twist and turn only to meet at the end in a burst of grandeur.  The characters are very interesting and well defined, as they are in all Gaiman writings.  Gaiman has struck a nerve with this book, and all I can hope is that he keeps writing, because he hasn't dissapointed me yet!
B00005RHGK|5.0|Yes the characters have no sense of logic, but this was scary. I don't care if the characters are stupid, just as long as it is scary. This is a creepy and scary movie with alot of suspense. Definately a crowd pleaser.
B000007XUQ|5.0|As traditional as a decorated christmas tree and frosted cookies, this album of christmas music is a must have for anyone who wants to create the spirit of christmas in their home. There are secular and religious moments here, to provide a great balance of the christmas spirit. I have about 15 christmas cds, and this one is BY FAR the most indespensible. I have to hear it at least 20 times each season, and definately on the 25th. It's remarkable.
B000050FEN|4.0|Okay, for those who liked Silence of the Lambs, this is a horror film for you. It's a mix between a murder mystery, crime drama, suspense film, and horror film. Yes this is a slasher film, this is a body count film. This is a slasher film with class. Director David Fincher doesn't want his audience to be comfortable for a moment while watching \\"Seven.\\" Shaky camera shots, dark sets and a disturbing script that takes its characters to the extremes of emotion all contribute to the film creating a unsettled feeling that stays with you for a couple hours after the credits roll. The first time I watched this, I didn't like it, but that is because I wasn't really paying attention to it, and the sound and color on my t.v. wasn't working right. Anyway, the film begins with the overused premise of a young cop (Brad Pitt) being teamed for a murder investigation with an veteran on the verge of retirement. The two quickly develop a tense disrespect for each other, Pitt being the cocky smartass type and Freeman the hardened, pessimist New Yorker who has seen it all. Their investigation of a bizarre murder, in which an obese man is forced to eat himself to death, turns into a hunt for a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins -- gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath as his calling card. The second victim, a rich lawyer, is the not-so-subtle tip off \\"greed\\" is written in blood on his carpet. What gives \\"Se7en\\" it's unsettling impact is the way the film connects deeply with each character, even the victims who are never seen alive. Freeman, Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife are all in top form here and the audience comes to know them intimately whatever affects them, affects the viewer equally. This is especially true of Pitt, whose character struggles to maintain his optimism in the face of the horrors he sees. The killer is played, by a well-known actor who is not named in the opening credits (the producers want to keep his identity a surprize), with a calm but explosive demeanor conspicuously reminiscent of \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" The tension is so well played that even though the unsatisfying conclusion becomes obvious a good 15 minutes before the climax, it doesn't diminish at all. Because of the way it assaults the emotions, seeing \\"Se7en\\" should not be taken lightly, and must be taken seriously to fully appreciate the film. This film has good acting, excellent script and a chilling soundtrack. I recommend buying or renting this film today, and watch it alone in the dark.lm but explosive demeanor conspicuously reminiscent of \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" The tension is so well played that even though the unsatisfying conclusion becomes obvious a good 15 minutes before the climax, it doesn't diminish at all.

0783222149|5.0|I like that Tina Turner song. Anyway...<br />This is a great movie. It's one of the few movies that I've seen more than once in the theater. Meryl is great and I have to say, Kevin Bacon is a true creep in this movie. The action is realistic and the cinematography is wonderful.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd just grows on you and keeps growing. Christina's voice is wonderful, the words powerful and invigorating. Whereas the first cd had a few good songs on it, this cd has every song that is worth listening to over and over. It's hard to believe this is the same girl who sang Genie in a Bottle. Maybe a bit over-pierced, but you can't alter the beauty of that voice.

B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory were playing with detuned guitars and 7-strings long before nu-metal made waves with bands like KoRn and Limp Bizkit. And y'know what? They're still better at it. The sound is heavy, angry, and bursts with electronic augmentation that brings out new facets to what could easily be boring death metal. Fear Factory knew that to really be good, they had to utilize the best of both worlds, organic and synthetic. With \\"Demanufacture,\\" their second album, they succeeded remarkably.<br />Every song is a sonic assault of blastbeats, ultralow end rhythms, crushing guitars, and Burton C. Bell's distinguishable voice. His growls and screams outweigh any of his death metal peers, and his ability to infuse melody and actual singing in with it is a wonderful testament to this band's ability to stretch the limits of industrial metal music. Dino's guitar riffs are really heavy, but they are played very cleanly, not sounding muddy or noisy (which Head and Munky from KoRn seem to think is cool-sounding...gag me). Raymond Herrera's drums are great, always hitting the beat, fast as hell, and just pounding into your head and leaving you wanting more.<br />Every song is great on this album. Even the covers of \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\" and \\"Your Mistake\\" are worth hearing. The band has managed to cover a song in their own unique style without killing the song or removing its magic (as most covers tend to do). The title track is brilliant, great chorus, great lyrics, and a good thrasher. Aside from that, my favorites are \\"Pisschrist,\\" \\"Replica,\\" \\"Self-Bias Resistor,\\" and the beautiful \\"A Therapy for Pain\\" (another song in the list of Fear Factory album closers that substitutes brutality for a final dose of ambient beauty). And overall, the band is just really tight, Rhys Fulber's electronics and production is top-notch, Dave McKean's album design is beautiful...there's nothing bad about \\"Demanufacture.\\"<br />Most people seem to think this album is their best. I wouldn't argue, though Ithink all of Fear Factory's albums have a lot to behold, and no one is better than the other. They each have their magic. \\"Demanufacture,\\" however, WAS the first Fear Factory CD I bought, and now I own them all (all the digipaks and not including singles). So perhaps that says something about this album's power that it made me want everything by the band. For people who are looking for some good old-fashioned brutality mixed with pulsating electronics, this is a great album to satisfy your palette. Check out the remix album, \\"Remanufacture\\" as well. No more regrets...get this CD.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Although there were moments in this film that I thought were inspired, I never really felt moved by it, whether it was sympathy for the characters, or suspense. Not a whole lot of emotion.<br />I just read a review of LOTR and the reviewer strongly stated that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a better film, so I came over to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; to say, &quot;NO WAY!

When I bought Titanic, the movie sailed away into my heart, I even burst into tears at the end and that does not happen often when I watch a movie. Titanic is truly \\"the ship of dreams\\".<BR> I floated away into the era of pure granduer and magic as Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio lit up the screen as Jack and Rose, two young lovers who are absolutely crazy for each other. However, love is hard sometimes. Rose's spirit, compared to that of a wild horse roaming the plains, is what draws herself towards Jack, who really thinks she is the greatest girl in the the world.<BR> The sunset is my favorite scene where Rose cries out \\"I'm flying\\" before she and Jack engage in the most endearing kiss.<BR> The Titanic then hits a lone iceburg one night.  The scenes are emotional, filled with pure terror, bitterness, and the ever-lasting screams of the dying.  Fifteen hundred will die.  Along with the sinking comes thrilling chases and hardness of envy.  When the ship sinks, Rose and Jack fight for survial, but in the end their love is star-crossed and Jack dies, but at least they are together again after death.<BR> A beautiful movie of tenderness, adventure, and the surival to live or die on the Titanic!
B000008LUN|4.0|UFO's first lp with guitar god Michael Schenker remains a hard rock classic. Built on the same format as Zeppelin's first lp, it is mostly heavy, bluesy rock with some acoustic material thrown in between to keep some balance. Any album with songs like Doctor, Doctor and Rock Bottom, is essential. The rest of the material is also good, and there was an urgency to Schenker's playing that isn't always present in later material.<BR>Some people complain about the production (handled by Ten Years After alumn Leo Lyons) of UFO's first three albums with Schenker. I personally prefer the \\"imperfect and druggy\\" sound of the first three over Ron Nevison's slicked up production on Lights Out/Obession etc. I mean would Natural Thing have the same effect on the listener if it wasn't for that muddy, treble deficiant production? <br />Anyways- Phenomenon remains a classic hard rock album, that guitar afficiendos should check out.
044651652X|5.0|\\"The Bridge of Madison County\\" by Robert James Waller.<br />To a casual reader, the book appears to be just another juicy love story between a divorced man, Robert Kincaid, a writer-photographer from Bellingham, Washington and Francesca Johnson, a farmer's wife in Madison County, Iowa. In August 1965, he was 52 and she was 45. To a serious sensible reader, the book is much more than that. It is a powerful book.<br />Kincaid was on an assignment to photograph covered bridges in Madison County for 'National Geographic' when he dropped in on a farmhouse on a country road. A woman was sitting on the front porch. \\"I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a covered bridge out this way, and I can't find it. I think I'm temporarily lost,\\" he said. \\"You're pretty close. The bridge is about two miles from here,\\" she said. \\"I'll be glad to show it to you, if you want.\\"<br />They spent next four days together in the farmhouse. Francesca's husband Richard and her son Michael, 17, and her daughter Carolyn, 16, were at Illinois State Fair. They fell hard for each other in these four incredible days. They danced in the kitchen to candlelight, and they made love in the kitchen, in the bedroom, and in the pasture. <br />Then he was inside her again, whispering soft words into her ear as he loved her, kissing her between phrases, between words, his arm around her waist, pulling her into him and him into her. And she murmured, softly, breathlessly, \\"Oh, Robert . . . Robert . . . I am losing myself.\\" He was an animal. A graceful, hard, male animal who did nothing overtly to dominate her yet dominated her completely, in the exact way she wanted that to happen at this moment.<br />\\"What are we going to do? he asked at the end of four days. \\"There is this damn sense of responsibility I have. To Richard, to the children. Just my leaving, taking away my physical presence, would be hard enough for Richard. That alone might destroy him,\\" she said. \\"On top of that, and this is even worse, he would have to live the rest of his life with the whispers of the people here. And children would hear snickering of Winterset for as long as they live here. As much as I want you and want to be with you and part of you, I can't tear myself away from the realness of my responsibilities.\\"<br />\\"Oh, Michael, Michael, think of them all those years, wanting each other so desperately. She gave him up for us and for Dad. And Robert Kincaid stayed away out of respect for her feelings about us. We treat our marriages so casually, and we were part of the reason that an incredible love affair ended the way it did,\\" said Carolyn after reading the letter her mother left. \\"They had four days together, just four. Out of a lifetime.\\"<br />Yes, Francesca and Robert spent only four days together out of a lifetime. They wanted each other so desperately. And yet, they endured the rest of their lives away from each other. Why? For what? To do the right thing. The right thing for Francesca was to think of Richard and their children. The right thing for Robert was to respect the feelings of Francesca. Herein lie the strength and power and moral of the story \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\"
B00006IU73|5.0|Anyone out there remember albums? I'm not talking about the fragmented slabs of singles & filler that come out every Tuesday. I'm talking about the complete experience, made up of songs, art, and the printed word. Something you can absorb as a whole. Nowadays, too many of us live quickly and demand that our music be sliced into bite-sized, easily digestible listening fodder. <br />Thankfully, Steven Wilson and Richard Barbieri of Porcupine Tree still remember albums. \\"We've always been more interested in the principle of an album as opposed to a set of individual songs that don't really hang together,\\" says Wilson. The latest of what Wilson refers to as \\"song-cycle\\" albums, In Absentia, is Porcupine Tree's major label debut and the band's first proper U.S. introduction. <br />Wilson's definition of a \\"song-cycle\\" album is basically anything where the record has \\"more substance as a whole, rather than broken down into its constituent parts.\\" Records like \\"Quadrophenia, Dark Side of the Moon... some of Zappa's...\\" Barbieri adds, \\"We try to be very ambitious and eclectic in a single record. Lyrics, artwork and music sit together very well. That's the way we approach Porcupine Tree albums. All aspects of media come together in this beautiful package.\\"<br />Some of you are probably wondering... who is Porcupine Tree anyway? Are they a new band? Not at all. The Tree (as the group's fans refer to them) started out as the brainchild of Steven Wilson back in 1987. The band actually started out as a parody, ala Spinal Tap. Tired of doing computer tech support, Wilson created a spoof of a rock band--complete with a fake history. Together as a band since 1993, Porcupine Tree is one of the U.K.'s most respected underground groups with a fanbase that spans the globe. <br />Let's talk about the CD. One of the coolest things about In Absentia is the multitude of musical styles on the disc, and the way they all seem to fit together--often within a single song. From the majestic opening track, \\"Blackest Eyes\\" to the soft, cinematic \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth,\\" the band effortlessly weaves its way through acoustic bits with tender harmonies, assorted electronic textures, expansive arrangements, and bits of metal--all thrown together to create a rich, sonically intense, musical landscape.<br />As for the songs themselves, they etch themselves into your memory the first time you hear them. \\"Blackest Eyes\\" has rock radio written all over it. \\"Trains\\" is a perfect example of contrasting musical styles juxtaposed against each other. \\"Lips of Ashes\\" is a melancholy acoustic tune with lush Crosby, Stills & Nash-like vocals. Wilson takes a stab at the music industry on \\"The Sound of Muzak\\" (yes, he has a bit of an attitude--always a good thing for a musician these days).<br />The band gives Rush a run for their money with the instrumental, \\"Wedding Nails,\\" only to be followed by the dreamy \\"Prodigal.\\" A great melody and a killer hook make this song another one that's perfect for airplay. \\".3\\" shows the darker side of the band with its driving bass line, and is the perfect companion to \\"Strip the Soul\\" (the album's first video, which is also included on the CD). Metal-heads will be drooling over \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape.\\" Then, in the complete opposite direction, they follow it with the intricately layered harmonies of \\"Heartattack in a Layby.\\"<br />For the collectors out there, the original pressings were released in a cardboard cover. After the first 20,000 copies are gone, it will be switched to the standard jewel box format. The CDs are different colors, depending on which copy you happen to get. The original discs (in the cardboard cover) were a blood red color; the jewel box version is black. There are also plans to released the album on vinyl (the band actually has a clause in their contract stating this).<br />Overall, In Absentia has a harder edge than the band's last two albums, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Porcupine Tree is poised for a huge breakthrough with this record. While not quite as consistent as their previous one, Lightbulb Sun, this is one disc that's sure to please old and new fans alike.
B00006V9A0|5.0|First off, I'm giving this a five-star rating because all the songs are excellent.  Now that I have that off my chest, I must point out, along with many other reviewers here, that this set could have been much better.  \\"You Know You're Right\\" should not be the first track on the collection.  \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" a dark, vivid, punk-psychedelic track, should not follow the humorous, catchy \\"In Bloom.\\"  On \\"Nevermind,\\" the sequence of \\"SLTS,\\" \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" works just fine.  Why rock the boat here by mixing it up?  The \\"In Utero\\" version of \\"All Apologies\\" should be included instead of the \\"Unplugged\\" version, and, also, the \\"Unplugged\\" version of \\"About a Girl\\" should replace the \\"Bleach\\" version.  Also, the omissions of substantial Nirvana cuts such as \\"Love Buzz,\\" \\"Blew,\\" \\"Sappy,\\" \\"Aneurysm\\" (from \\"Wishkah) and arguably Nirvana's greatest recorded moment, \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" (which is actually on the import versions of \\"Nirvana\\") mar a project that could have been.  Now, tracks like \\"Something in the Way,\\" \\"Drain You\\" and \\"Frances Farmer\\" should be left off.  They are reserved for true Nirvana fans, or for those who are just discovering the great treats Nirvana's albums possess.  They MUST be on the proposed box-set (due out in 2004).  If I was to do a version \\"Nirvana,\\" here is how it would be sequenced:<br />1.  Love Buzz (\\"Bleach\\")  2.  Blew (\\"Bleach\\")  3.  Sliver  4.  Spank Thru (live) (\\"Sliver\\" EP)  5.  Smells Like Teen Spirit  6.  In Bloom  7.  Come As You Are  8.  Lithium  9.  Aneurysm (live) (\\"Wishkah\\")  10.  Heart-Shaped Box  11.  Rape Me  12.  Sappy (\\"No Alternative\\" compilation)  13.  Pennyroyal Tea  14.  Dumb  15.  All Apologies (\\"In Utero\\")  16.  About a Girl (\\"Unplugged\\")  17.  The Man Who Sold the World  18.  You Know You're Right  19.  Where Did You Sleep Last Night (\\"Unplugged\\")<BR>---it should also include \\"Endless, Nameless\\" as a bonus cut, to illustrate just how spontaneously whacky Nirvana could be.  That's my 10cents worth.
0679735909|3.0|The pacing of this book was such that I considered giving up on it half-way through--but I'm glad I stuck with it, because the ending was good. The author (or editors) could have easily shaved off about 100 pages from the novel, but oh well.<br />I found the characters too stuffy and too engrossed in their work.  Their whole lives revolved around dead writers from the 19th century.  Also, it was hard to really get into and care about writers that never even existed, although the author does a good job of making Randolph Henry Ash and Cristable LaMotte believable (I had to look them up to see if they actually were real or not).  I think the novel would have been more compelling had she used REAL 19th century authors, say, pairing up Emily Bronte with Charles Dickens perhaps?  Now THAT'S something I'd like to see!<br />Interspersed throughout are poems and stories from the two authors in question.  This is what really held up the story.  While I really wanted to know what Roland and Maud were up to, I had to read 10 pages of some fake literature from a fake 19th century author.  There really wasn't much point to reading all that--you can skip right through them and not be the worse for it (I did, eventually).  The letters were also a little long, but I guess that's how they wrote back then.<br />All the really juicy stuff doesn't come until the end, so hang in there.
B000002U82|5.0|This is my third favorite Floyd album (number one is &quot;The Wall&quot;, of course, and number two is &quot;The Final Cut&quot;). It captured a huge audience when it was released and remains a huge best-seller. Still, I find the lyrics lacking somewhat and the playing sub-par to &quot;The Wall&quot; (even Floyd band members admit the same). Unfortunately, although it is a great recording, there are a few subtle flaws from that era. I would not call it a bad album, by any means, I just don't think it is their best.
B0000041ZT|5.0|Shostakovich is not the typical example of a composer writing \\"easy-listening\\" music. \\"Leningrad\\", \\"Babi Yar\\" and so many other compositions full of passion, with hidden (or not) political and other messages. In this CD a new Shostakovich is can be found, the composer that writes joyful music (Piano con. No 2 is another example). The Concertgebouw Orchestra is at top form and Riccardo Chailly let the music speak for itself. An excellent CD not to be missed...
B000006TRV|5.0|I like Classic Rock and this is my favorite. I have personally owned around 2000 albums. Of course, I have listened to quite a few more. I have listened to this album (2 CDs, LPs and cassettes) over 200 times. Yes, over two hundred times. I love this album. Just when I hear a contemporary album that sounds good, soon after that I usually put this album on and it blows the others away. It is a little dark and a little angry, but well written, played and recorded. Not much more to ask for.
6304077939|2.0|I agree with the reviewer from Sillicon Valley. Sure this movie starts out with a few funny scenes, but it just gets more and more depressing as it goes along. Mental illness, and familial abuse,is just not amusing for a two hour movie. And for cat lovers don't watch this video ! there is a cat rape scene and the cat is realy suffering in this scene, it doesn't look faked. The cat is panting and terrified. But, the boy in the film is very sensative and overly intelligent for his mentally ill family. And there is no clear reason why he is commited to the nut house like the rest of his family, just becuase his mother finds him in a pool of vomit?
B000002C1V|5.0|This has some of the darkness of &quot;The Wall&quot;, but it is more obviously biographical in nature. The band plays very well, as the great recording quality shows, but the band is quick to point out that it is &quot;Roger's album&quot;. I think that is a good thing. Great lyrics abound. Many Floyd fans consider this album to be their finest (my second favorite Floyd album). The majority of Classic Rock listeners might prefer &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (my third favorite Floyd album). My favorite is &quot;The Wall&quot;, of course.
B000002O51|5.0|&#34;Third Stage&#34; is a great album from start to finish.  The opening ballad &#34;Amanda&#34; is melodic and majestic. &#34;We're Ready&#34; and &#34;Cool the Engines&#34; are catchy.  And &#34;Can'tcha Say / Still in Love&#34; has a great trade-off of Brad Delp vocals and Tom Scholz guitar riffs.  Be sure to listen to this one through headphones so you can hear the textured layers of guitar and voice.  New addition Garry Pihl trades lead guitar lines with Tom on the rocking tune &#34;I Think I Like It.&#34;  Though this album was really created by only 3 guys -- Scholz, Delp, and drummer Jim Masdea -- it is vintage Boston!
B00000K2SE|4.0|The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi thrillers I've ever seen. It is a movie that does not sacrifice plot for special effects, as is the case with films loke Lost in Space.<br />The storyline concerns a man named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) who finds himself hunted down by the Agents, minions of the ruling Agent (Hugo Weaving). He is advised by a mysterious man whom Thomas has never met before to attempt escape as quickly as possible. After being captured in the attempt, Thomas is briefly interrogated, then released. He finally meets Morpheus (Lawrence Kasdan) who is the man who had been advising Thomas. He grants access to the Matrix, a world that possesses total control over Earth. Morpheus is captain of a space ship inside the Matrix. He believes that Thomas is the Chosen One, the One who would defeat the Matrix and liberate Planet Earth from the controlling grasp of the Matrix dimension . . .<br />The Matrix is a visual feast for the eyes, a special effects extravaganza, which is most noticable in the heavy combat scenes. But there is also a good storyline. The film also seems to be trying to make a point. The body cannot live without the mind. The film gets that message across clearly. It also seeks to answer the big question, what is reality? It gives the viewer a lot to think about. All this in an awesome sci-fi setting. An awesome movie. Why the missing star? Because some actors are not as convincing in their roles as others are. 4 stars.
B000063V8T|5.0|The high quality of the 4th season episodes continues in the 5th.Dispite such clinckers as Imaginary Friend,and the over hyped yet warmly welcomed apperence of Spock in Unification,five also included The First Duty,Darmok,and The Inner Light as well as many great episodes.The season also saw the passing of Gene Roddenberry,and Rick Berman finally in place of the heir apperent,which metephorically was seen in the final scene of Unification as Spock mind-melded with Picard,finally closing the &quot;Generational Gap&quot;.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds To Mars is original, talented, and perfect in all musical aspects. All the songs on this cd are PERFECT. If you buy this cd you will not be dissaapointed. Every song gets 5/5. Pick this up right away!
B00003CXAQ|5.0|It's impossible for me to review this film without constantly bringing up how ridiculous it is, but don't get me wrong - I honestly love \\"Temple of Doom.\\" It's probably the most watchable of the Indiana Jones series, although it follows the same formula of beginning with the tiniest shred of legendary trivia and developing it into an elaborate excuse for blowing up obscenely expensive movie sets. In this case we're looking for the \\"lost Sankara Stones,\\" which may or may not have precedence in some Hindu scripture - it doesn't really matter, does it? In fact, we're only looking for them because our plane happened to crash over the remote village in India from which they were taken. And we were only on that plane because we were fleeing sinister diamond-theiving assassins in China...this is how the plot unfolds in an Indiana Jones movie. It's as simultaneously contrived and irrational as \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,\\" yet it takes itself seriously. <br />Well...more or less. The real secret to the success of these films is that they interject moments of (what they know the audience will identify as) \\"humor\\" in with the \\"action.\\" Along for comic relief on this ride are spoiled blond stock-character #36 \\"Willie Scott\\" and Asian orphan stock-character #61 \\"Short Round,\\" the \\"love-interest\\" and the \\"kid\\" respectively, convenient but disposable (remember Marion Ravenwood?) sidekicks for \\"Indy\\" to exchange deadpan remarks with in between karate chops. Willie is excruciatingly whiny and Short Round is an obnoxious brat - yeah, so? Somebody has to complicate the plot by screwing things up for our hero every once in a while. They're basically a couple of useless liabilities, but noble Indy will defend them to the death (or at least to the end of the film) and that's why we love him, blah blah blah. <br />Anyway, this A-team I've just described winds up riding elephant-back up the hill from the village to the local effeminate 10-year-old Majarajah's palace for a spectacularly offensive supper of beetles and brains. And the palace, as luck would have it, is actually the back-door to a colossal inner temple of Kali run by a supposed reconstitution of the Thugghi cult. It is this cult that stole the Stones from the village - oh, along with all the village children, just in case you wouldn't have been emotionally invested enough in the rocks alone to care. The children, you see, have been set to slave-labor in the mines, searching for the last two Sankara Stones because the complete set will render the Thugghi all-powerful - how trite can you get? And once again, who cares. Nobody's wanting or expecting deep (or any) thought here. Just rip out a few hearts, jump off a few bridges, blow up lots and lots of stuff, and nobody's gonna complain. Indy and Co. manage to singlehandedly take on the entire cult of hundreds of insane and bloodthirsty fanatics (read: \\"heathens\\") and emerge without a scratch - improbable? They succeed in destroying the Thugghi, returning the Stones to Shiva if not to the village (after all it WAS rather materialistic of those villagers to cling to such trinkets), and, of course, freeing the enslaved children - you buy it? Well fortunately you don't have to - the movie buys it for you wholesale, just so that you can have that final shot of all the kids running back into the village and reuniting with their parents to a soaring theatrical score as Indy and Willie make out 30's style and Short Round rolls his eyes, and then your whole family can leave satisfied and fulfilled with smiles on your faces, since the movie has so deftly targeted the soft spots of every possible demographic in one fell swoop.<br />But don't get me wrong....<br />They really don't make movies like this anymore. Today's audience is jaded beyond this level of corny...they're on to a whole new post-postmodern level of corny. Nowadays we have films like \\"The Scorpion King\\" with its CGI hordes and generic pro-wrestler personalities, which are essentially Puffy-remix variations on Indiana Jones themes. \\"Temple of Doom\\" is a uniquely 80's phenomenon. Yet it remains intensely absorbing if only as a parade of lunatic images.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Do you guys remember Shannon?  She sang &quot;Let The Music Play&quot;.  I always loved that record.   Shannon opened for Madonna when that record was huge.  I heard &quot;Burning Up&quot; recently on the radio, and I coundn't get it out of my head...it made me think of what the clubs must have been like c.1983.  I want to go!   Well, since that is impossible, I decided to buy &quot;Madonna&quot;.  No regrets!  Love &quot;Burning Up&quot;, and have you heard what was not a top 40 hit (though there are those too) &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;?  Great record.  Madonna was making the records she heard in the clubs, and becoming a superstar in the process.  This album shows why she is a star - the girl taps into cool.  M- if you read this, thanks!  Many memories!  You may say you hadn't trained your voice, but whatever, this is a FUN record, all the way into 2002.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The music on this album is not \\"obvious, catchy, mass produced, every day\\" kind of music. It holds ideas, perceptions, and fears that initially the majority of people are too lame and impatient to explore. The key to this album is exploration and this takes time (3 years for me). Give it plenty of chances and this album will rerward you with astonishing beauty that you once thought was never there. <BR>To me, now, the album doesn't hold any weak tracks, even though the album is better viewed collectively, rather than indivdually. Airbag (opening track) seems to be about Yorke's view on driving and in particular how every time we have a near accident on the road and shake our heads in disbelief, instead we should pull over and jump for joy screaming, \\"I'm back, I'm still here, I'm still alive!\\"<BR>Track 2, Paranoid Android is worthy of album status alone. It is art-rock at it's truly best with the band in full swing with odd time signatures, mood swings and general obscuritys...I guess that's one of the reasons I've come to love this album so much.<br />Instead of reviewing every song, instead I'll pick out highlight/main points. and skim the rest.<BR>Track 3 Subteranian homesick alien is what about being so unhappy with modern day life that you dream of being taken away to live your life in a new \\"supernatural\\" place that protects you from life and it's ugliness.<BR>For me the next track is undoubtedly one of if not the best song on the album. \\"exit music\\"(for a film) starts with intention, it airs seriousness, you just know that Yorke is telling you something that is going to give you a lump in your throat from the second you hear his broken voice coming in. The band come in halfway through and create a brilliant climax before Yorke finishes off by telling us \\"we hope that you choke\\" several times by which point you'll probably like me, be on the verge of crying. You know your listtening to brilliance when an album can do that to you.<BR>next, \\"let down\\" is a guitar jangly track that basically sums up the feeling of being very low with all the speed and craziness of the world whizzing around you. Reapeated listens make it a highlight.<BR>\\"Karma Police\\" is a single from the album, and is undoubtedly brilliant but perhaps now one of the tracks I feel least inclined to listen to. It's about how the band created a force called the \\"Karma Police\\" who would come and get you every time you did wrong...I think. One of those bizzare ideas again.<BR>\\"Fitter Happier\\" is track 7 and acts almost as an interlude. Some have viewed this track as \\"irritating\\" or \\"humorous\\" but to be honest they have missed the mark by a long shot. The last thing that this track suggests is humour. For me, it's vital, it binds the album together and overviews the entire album in one track. It get's accross the idea that we are all useless in todays world and are almost \\"programmed\\" to behave in set ways to promote efficiency and standards. What they are saying here, is that there is no \\"feeling\\" in life anymore and we are all seen as a statistic rather than a person.<BR>\\"Electioneering\\" track 8 is probably the weakest on the album, but at the same time the most accesible, maybe with the exception of Karma Police. It is the most standard, rock song on the album, and leans more towards \\"the bends\\" era. It is good but doesn't have the depth to it that the other tracks do.<BR>\\"Climbing up the walls\\" is up next and it was written by Thom, concerning time he spent working in a mental hospital when he was younger. This is a brooding track that sends a chill up your spine. The words \\"either way you turn, I'll be there...open up your skull, I'll be there\\" are simply enough to make YOU afraid. Thom has this ability throughout, to make you actually believe what he's saying, he feels his music, and therfore you feel his emotion.<BR>\\"No Surprises\\" track 10, put simply, makes you want to cry. It talks of \\"a heart that's full up like a landfill\\" and \\"bruises that won't heal\\"sounds like a man who's taken enough and can't get up and as a result is resigned to the \\"quiet life\\" of \\"no alarms, and no surprises\\"<BR>\\"Lucky\\" the penultimate track is uplifting and glorious. It was the frist track written for the album and features on the \\"war child\\" album. This was a sign of the brillance of what was to come on the rest of the album<BR>\\"The tourist\\" is the closing 12th track and it was written by Johnny Greenwood (lead guitarist, amongst other instruments)<BR>It is about the stereotypical American tourist who runs about like a headless chicken trying to get hi moneys worth. \\"slow dow, idiot slow down\\" Yorke shouts! The track ends in a very fitting way, with a little plink of a triangle or some instrument like that...then you get a sinking feeling...and then you realise you've just listened to 40 odd minutes of genius all on one little CD!<BR>All in all \\"Ok Computer\\" sounds like a band who have been living in their own little world, doing their own little thing, viewing the rest of the big world, and then giving a take on how they see things in this big bad world and then releasing it to that big bad world, expecting it top get \\"rubbished\\" but in truth, we admire, and can to relate to many of the messages coming from the world I call \\"Radiohead\\"<BR>Without question the greatest album of all time and probably always will be.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina rocks! I buy a lot of CD's, and this one is by far the best I've heard in many years, by ANY artist out there. Christina has the voice of an angel, and unlike her last CD, which was pop flavored throughout, the music on \\"Stripped\\" is intelligent, thoughtful and deep. Great grooves, great melodies, amazing harmonies and probably one of the best produced CD's I've ever heard. I often find myself stopping in my tracks just to really listen to what she is doing with her amazing voice. Christina captivates me, not only by her unique beauty, but by her incredible control of what makes great music.
B00005JL96|4.0|My husband grew up on Maui and remembers with great fondness what it was like growing up with the Aloha feeling in the air. This movie was able to bring that all back to him. I was about to cry during a very poignant moment in the movie and turned to him for comfort only to find that he was crying. I had to be the strong one! It would be wonderful for more people to understand the feeling of Aloha and how important it is to be ohana. <br />The movie is well done and beautifully animated. The characters reminded my husband of people he grew up with . The body shapes of the characters were very stereotypical of the native Hawaiians. These were real people, not some fantasy image that no one could relate to. <br />I look forward to sharing this one with my children. I want them to know that they are ohana--family.
B000002KO1|5.0|The problem with the first Pretenders record was that it was so damn good it set expectations of the band incredibly high, and Scott & Farndon cracked under pressure.<br />   In this album, you have the perfect mix of four musicians at a time when it was satori for them to get together. <br />   First,Chrissie, who was at here cocky I'm-a-woman-of-the-world-and I'll-kick-your-ass-if-you-abuse-me-again best voice, sounds like a dominatrix with a hidden heart of gold & not the PETA militant we get now (although you can see it coming on this album, but it seems like it would be more). She has the perfect balance of rage AND sensitivity on this album. It's watching oragami fragile idealism wrapped in Kevlar armor with leather & studs over it. It's fascinating as to how the combo got wedded together. She sings tender-but-wary ballads (\\"Kid\\") along side of fever sex dreams that show that the mystery of sex still outweighs the mistrust (\\"Mystery Achievement\\", \\"Up The Neck\\", \\"The Wait\\") and tales of survival (\\"Tatooed Love Boys\\", \\"The Phone Call\\") & confidence (\\"Brass In Pocket\\", \\"Private Life\\").<br />   Secondly, you have James-Honeyman Scott. Why, oh why, you a**hole did you have to O.D.? Didn't you know you were probably the greatest new wave guitar player this side of Tom Verlaine?<BR>This album is rife with extrodinarily economic but blistering riffs. JHS was old enough to rock out melodically like guitarists of yore, but added enough punkish noise to the fuel like Nostradamus's match, predicting the coming of Sonic Youth & Nirvana. The use of the atmospheric harmonic line from \\"Tatooed Love Boys\\" is STILL brilliant. And, my god you played like a hot rod drives: foot on the floor to the end of the quarter whether you were going to explode or not. Maybe it's not a wonder that you flamed out...<br />    Lastly, you had Farndon & Chambers. It's such a cliche to put the rythm section together, but they really did work as a unit. Like Scott, they mixed the best old school with a brave new edge of the new. Best of all, they were learned in the thump of R&B which kicked the Pretenders to the top of the heap in playing. Having been an O.P. (origional punker) in those days, let me tell you, it wasn't the snottiness or the aggression that made bands bad, it was the fact that they didn't GROOVE. These guys, however, had it in SPADES. Tragically, Petey decided to follow Jimmie & loaded the essence of poppy flower in his veins once too many times. So, after one more album, Chambers sounded lost without his groove mate.<br />     One of the other reviewers was talking about the philosophy that old school punk was an attitude. This is SOOO true. This album was the first living proof that you could sell an album with it. It just took street smarts.<br />    A classic.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|Unforgiven you realize, a few minutes in, is not your typical westen. Nor is it your typical Clint Eastwood movie. And it probably surely isn't your typical Best Picture Oscar winner. Telling the story of Willam Munny (Clint Eastwood), a retired bounty hunter who goes on one last job, to kill the men who slashed a prostitute's face. Now doesn't that sound like a fun movie! Whoppee! Errr... Not really. Actually it sound's downright depressing. And it is. Along the way Willam meets up with his longtime partner played by Morgon Freeman. Together they set out to kill those above mentioned men. About this time we switch over to the late Richard Harris's character. Who also is after the reward money offered up by the town prostitutes for the killing of those men I've mentioned twice already. He isn't after them long as he gets beaten and kicked by the towns people, mainly thier crooked sheriff, Little Bill (played suberbly by Gene Hackman).<BR>He isn't the typical bad guy, either, in fact he's almost good in comparison with other bad guys in other movies. All of this leads up to a spectacular climax with a showdown between Willam Munny and Little Bill. Unforgiven also convienently managed to snag 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (For Clint Eastwood's terrific directing), Best Supporting Actor (For Gene Hackman's marvelous Little Bill). All should see Unforgiven, whether all would enjoy it is another matter. But who can forget Little Bill's words \\"I'm just trying to build a house!\\"
B00006RAKP|4.0|Being a Elton John fan for over twenty years I was very happy to see that he would be releasing a new greatest hits disc this year.<BR>It is filled with some of the best music that he and bernie (along with others)ever produced. This multi cd album is truely a must have for any true fan of Mr.John.<BR>This is a great album to get a real feel for Elton's body of work, but I beleve the other albums he made are also worth a look too.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Moulin Rouge is an absolutely marvelous film with absolutely extradinary music. This is that music. All the songs are great, while not all unfortunately are here. Not included is the terrific rendition of Like A Virgin and Spectacular, Spectacular (You have to get Moulin Rouge 2 to have those songs). To start out we have Nature Boy, which I must confess, I usually skip to get to the faster paced songs, starting with, track 2. Lady Marmalade is a well done version of the original with Christina Aquliera, Pink and who knows who else. I think that this song pretty much bought the CD for a lot of people. Which is too bad because there are much better songs here. We than have track 3, Because We Can. This is a bouncy fun little dance track that will be sure to have you tapping your toes to the beat. The lyrics also, are not very complex. Track 4 is Sparkling Diamonds, sung by Nicole Kidman.<BR>The best part of which contains a snippet of Madonna's Material Girl. Track 5, is a spectacular dance track entitled Rhythm Of The Night. It's plenty of fun and sung by a singer named Valerie.<BR>Track 6, surely one of the best tracks on the disc, is a total redo of Elton John's classic 'Your Song'. First let me say that with a voice like that I can't understand why Ewan McGregor isn't<BR>a professional singer, he could have two big jobs, like Jennifer Lopez. This Ewan McGregor version in my opinion even improves on the original Elton John version. Track 7 is all rock. Children Of The Revolution, sung by U2's Bono is a great rock song and Track 8 contrasts it with Nicole Kidman's smooth vocals and easy lyrics on One Day I'll Fly Away. Track 9 is Diamond Dogs, a bouncy fun track sung by Beck. Track 10 is the Elephant Love Medley. <BR>Meaning it's about 6 minutes of the film where Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are singing favorites like All You Need Is Love, I Could Always Love You, One More Night, and Heroes. All and all a great track and one of the best. Track 11 gives us Come What May, the main love song in the movie. A great song although I personally prefer the Remix, but still quite extradinary.<BR>Track 12 is Roxanne and is magnificent and flows with latin vibes. <BR>Very memorable and cool. Track 13 is one of the more forgettable on the disc, Complainte De Butte which I won't even try to explain more than to say it's sounds sort of opera-esqe. Track 14 has an even more confusing title, Hindi Sad Diamonds and I can't tell you more than to say that it is the scene where the cast of the play is on stage doing one of the final scenes. It is slightly catchy but sort of weird I still think. The last track, 15, is another version of Nature Boy, the one used to close the movie.<BR>All in all this is a very enjoyable CD that is well worth your money.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam proves once again that they are so far of everyone its not any funny.  The songs on Riot Act are the best the band have ever written(with the exceptions being black and grievance). Songs like \\"save you\\" and \\"ghost\\" prove to all the critics that they can still rock with the best of them.  Riot Act is a breath of musical fresh air in a time where bad rap and blink182 ripoffs are receivng credit that they dont deserve. And im not going to get started on the so called \\"it\\" bands-hives,strokes- three words- COMB YOUR HAIR. Anyway i am encouraging all of you to pick up this album if you are a pearl jam fan and if you are not a fan this will open your eyes.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card, in my opinion, has outdone himself with this novel.  In fact, I find it to be better than any of his other works.  For those who enjoy his tight, focused writing style, imagination, and plotlines, this book is sure to exceed expectations.<BR> The story concerns a young boy, Ender, who is a genius in a family of geniuses, a third child in a world where the limit is two per family.  Humankind has been at war with an alien race for some time, and those children that possess the intelligence are culled from the rest and sent to an orbital school to train as future commanders.  This training takes the form of classes in part, but also includes the Game, where the children are set against each other in armies, battling clothed in suits that react to the light guns they fire at one another.<BR> Ender is very young and is viewed as useless by his superiors among the students, but he soon proves his tactical genius and eventually ends up as the commander of his own army composed entirely of the young and inexperienced.  As their leader, he crafts this band of misfits into an army that emerges undefeated from every conflict.<BR> As a backdrop to this, Ender's genius brother and sister, the former to hateful and the latter too kind to have entered the school, begin their own work back on Earth.  They use careful release of ideas and manipulation of public thought to exact a slow but effective political takeover of the world's governments.<BR> Meanwhile, Ender's exploits do not go unnoticed; when the teachers at the school realize his potential they begin to stack the odds against Ender, giving his army's adversaries multiple advantages.  Amazingly, he and his army continue to defeat all comers, and he is eventually shipped out to begin his final training, and the revelation at its end that will alter the course of his life and his own view of himself forever.<BR> This book is interesting in many ways and for several reasons.  Firstly, it is a fascinating lookinside the mind of a young boy.  Granted, not a very ordinary one, but the way Ender and his thoughts are portrayed hearkens back to the way we all viewed the world at one time or another.  Card has done an excellent job at capturing this on the page.<BR> Another reason this book is different is that, while questions about such things as forgiveness, guilt, penance, conflict resolution, authority, leadership, and many more are raised, they are answered in a way that does not delve deeply into boring, soapbox philosophy or vague, bland plot-movers.  Ender's internal struggles with the power his phenomenal intelligence has granted him, the actions he is forced to take, and the deeds he is unwittingly made to commit are fascinating to witness.  He is also introduced to a darker, baser element within himself by the combat in the Game and the violence perpetrated against him by his fellows at the school.  His inner grapplings with these demons of the self perhaps have something to say to everyone.  On a side note, I would say that while this book may involve children, it is most assuredly not children's level reading, and probably not for most children either.  There are several violent episodes involving bodily injury and even death when Ender is drawn into fights with his classmates, and these may be judged to be too much for younger readers.<BR> This book is an excellent commentary on the rights and wrongs of conflict, and will likely cause the reader to examine his or her own views on the same.  But over and beyond that, it is an enjoyable read and is backed up by several sequels and parallel novels, meaning that the adventure does not end with this book.  However, I regard this to be the best of the series.
B00006M183|5.0|First, I have to comment on what the Amazon editor Aidin Vaziri wrote. To say that the lyrics \\"I know that I'm born and I know that I die/The in between is mine.\\" is evident of self obsession is copletely incorrect. The lyrics are taken verbatim from an ageless confucian theory that states there are but two certainties in life: birth and death. What you do with the time in between is of your own making. As any Pearl Jam fan can attest to, Eddie's lyrics are always poetic and often intellectual. Perhaps the best example of this is in the penetrating lyrics of \\"Indifference\\" which are enough to bring a grown man to his knees in self-relfection.<BR>That being said, I think this album is excellent. While it may not appeal to new Pearl Jam fans, the veterans will embrace it with dreams of live performances. This album, as with Binaural, is missing the catchy songs of Ten and Vs, but instead contains the powerful rifts and lyrical momentum that >is< a live Pearl Jam experience. This album probably will not make a permanent place in your 6-disc changer but it is sure to come back into rotation after you feel what Eddie and the rest of Peal Jam translates the songs into at their live shows.
0151008116|3.0|This is the first book I've read written by Yann Martel, Canadian writer. It was sitting on the coffee table of a friend's house I was visiting, I picked it up and I couldn't put it down. Intensely compelling and riveting, this book picks you up in the first chapter and never fails to let you go.<br />Poor Pi, living under the strain of having a oft-teased first name &quot;Piscene&quot;, grows up in Indian at the Pondicherry Zoo, among the animals that will become so important in the second part. The first part of the tale is delightful, from Pi's reflections of life as a zookeeper's son, to his awakening spirituality in three modern religions. Very funny part ensure when his parents try to puzzle out his religious choices, whereas to Pi, it's just simply true. You grow to love Pi and cheer for him.<br />However, the story takes a dramatic and somewhat disappointing turn with the second, and most important, part of the story. Pi's imprisonment in a lifeboat with a bengal tiger turns this fun story into an adventure saga, one which I didn't expect nor want. As we endure his days on the lifeboat, where &quot;life&quot; in its cruelest forms plays out, the reading sometimes becomes tiresome and confusing. Pi's hallucinations only add to the mixture. I didn't really want a survival story. Whereas the first part of his story promises a spiritual component to it, the second part lets down.<br />In the thid section, Martel tries to draw some parallels between the two, but some of them were lost on me, and probably require an additional reading to appreciate them.<br />Ovreall, the Life of Pi is a tremendous work, but uneven. Perhaps another reading at another time will illuminate this work to the greatest of which I hoped. Until then, I will only mildly recommend it to my friends.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Extremely funny movie. Lots of laughs. Reese Witherspoon does a fantasic job.

B00000I01A|5.0|The songs on this CD are awesome. I have at one time or another used every single one of them as a workout song. No Easy Way out is probably one of my all time favorites: It is the perfect mix of 80s synth with 80s rock singing, timeless. Eye of the Tiger is probably the best known song on this album but the Training Montage and others make the CD far more valuable than just as a single for Eye of the Tiger. If you need something to pump you up and get you motivated this CD will do it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|For those of you who may not know this, GLADIATOR IS A FICTIONAL STORY.  Despite this the movie does a LOT to get things right.  You have to appreciate that simple fact.  It's truly a visual masterpeice, you are actually take back to ancient Rome.  The battle at the beggining is very well done.  For those of you say it's historically innacurate... it's fiction.... though some events are obviously based on fact... it's simply meant to entertain.... and that it does.  It does an excellent job of showing the struggle of power between the emperor or Rome and the senate, the plotting, schemeing, and corruption that occured, and how instable an emperor could be.  It's about time we have more EPIC's on scale with movies from the 50's and 60's.  Gladiator is an awesome movie and I reccomend it to everyone.
0151006903|5.0|As others have mentioned, the protagonist of this tale comes across as a medieval Forrest Gump, someone who happens to bumble from one situation to the next with a great deal of luck, meeting Frederick Barbarossa the Emperor of Germany, surviving the sack of Constantinople, traveling all over the known world meeting various cultures, and making sense of it in a simplistic yet humorous It-is-what-it-is manner. Eco's writing style is enjoyable yet extremely interesting, like reading Don Quixote, except with a greater need for historical research seeing as how Cervantes lived in the period of his writing and Eco is looking back on it.<BR>Although Latin pilgrims (besiegers) are rather more dangerous than windmills, we still see our hero charging into the fray, saving the helpless, telling his tale to his own Sancho Panza (Niketas).<BR>Baudolino is crude and funny, heroic and human.<BR>I really enjoyed this story.
B000067CPX|5.0|What else can I say?  The first time I listened to this CD all the way through, I felt that they deserve the award this year.  My tastes run across all genres, and my CD collection shows it.  But, this is a good example of a crowd pleaser.  I know everyone is disappointed as RHCP become more \\"commercial\\" and/or \\"studio\\", but I say to all of you, lighten up and give this album the credit it deserves! It is completely solid.  Every song warrants repeat play with the exception of \\"Cabron\\", which does get a bit old quickly.  But, it hasn't stopped me from listening to this CD at least twenty times.  My final comment is that I appreciate albums that don't fizzle out into \\"filler\\" at the end.  When you get to track twelve on this CD, you're just getting going.  Very well done.  I hope they win.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|It seems like anything Eminem puts his name on nowadays breaks some kind of record.  His third studio album has sold over 6.5 million copies since June, his first movie made over $50 million at the box office and this ensuing soundtrack topped N'Sync-er Justin Timberlake's album on Billboard.  To put it simple: He cannot be stopped.<br />The four songs Eminem appears on throughout this album prove that last statement.  \\"Lose Yourself\\" shows how much Eminem has grown as a lyricist.  Remember when everyone was against him for killing his wife, raping his mother and bashing homosexuals in his landmark \\"The Marshall Mathers LP?\\"  Now, Eminem shows that he is a deeper individual than those same people thought.  He still has all of his lyrical punchlines for different targets like Lynne Cheney and C. Delores Tucker, two advocates against Eminem's right to free speech.  Overall, the three solo songs Em recorded for this album are three of the best songs Eminem has and probably will ever put out.<br />But wait, this review isn't just about Eminem.  This is a soundtrack which features many different artists.  The first six songs show off Eminem and his labelmates from Shady Records: D12, Obie Trice and the newly signed 50 Cent.  Eminem is no joke as a label-head either; he knows who to sign.  Obie Trice and 50 Cent each get their chance to show their skill and both do very well.  After Shady Records gets their props, the listener gets treated to new cuts from Jay-Z, Xzibit, Nas, Rakim and Gang Starr.  The best of these new tracks has to be the cut with Jay-Z and Freeway.  Freeway is gonna blow up like no other when his solo drops.  He almost comes to top Jay-Z on \\"8 Miles & Runnin'.\\"  Rakim is also getting his time to shine.  He's on a come back trail with Dr. Dre and don't be surprised if he comes back in a BIG way.<br />The only problems with this cd are the two cuts that don't fit the pattern this album was going for.  Macy Gray and Boomkat don't flow well with the rest of the cd.  I never listened to either of these cuts because i'm not into that kind of music.  I especially don't care for Macy Gray.  Her voice is annoying and so is she.<br />This is a really, really good soundtrack.  Most people bought this cd for the Eminem cuts, but will be pleasently surprised with the other cuts.
B000066NW0|4.0|The album 'Let Go' by Avril Lavigne, contains a variety of music styles which would leave most people putting this album on repeat!<br />As a new artist, Avril Lavigne has done well to brainwash anyone who would usually listen to just their usual kind of music to the album 'Let Go'.<br />Let Go contains a variety of pop/punk songs, which makes a change if you're into both pop and rock genres... cause this album will get you hooked either way!<br />Many people arugue that Avril Lavigne is pop and not punk!  Well... not entirely true.   The album contains most songs that cannot be categorised as total pop songs... they're mostly pop/punk.<br />Most people don't realise that the album 'Let Go' could of been more rockier than it already is.  When Avril first made some of the songs for Let Go, it was known to be too hard and too rocky for what the record company Arista expected it to be... so they had to tone it down abit, but still keep a pop/punkish sound to the album.<br />If anyone was to buy something they have yet to listen to or want to try out something new... then the album 'Let Go' by Avril Lavigne is a must get to your collection on your CD rack!<br />Artist: Avril Lavigne<BR>Album:  Let Go<BR>Genre:  Pop/Punk<BR>Current Hits:  Complicated,  Sk8r Boi
B00003CX5P|4.0|First of all I am an avid Star Wars fan and I really loved the orinigal trilogy. Me and my older sister an brother grew up with them (I was only 2 when Return of the Jedi came out). Anyway now to the review.<br />   The story is not that bad. But it was formulatic.But however the REAL story actually involves the Sith, Dark Jedis who after a thousand years of absence are now making the plot to take over the galaxy. He makes an alliance with the greedy trade federations who invades a planet called Naboo. You all know the story So I will stop here.<br />The acting was not bad at all but its not oscar calibre. Liam Neeson does a fine job as Qui Gon Jin. He is my favoriat charector in the movie. He is probably the most interesting person in he movie. He as a Jedi even questions his superiors judgement when it comes to Anakin's fate which is dangerous. Qui Gon (WARNING SPOILERS COMING) when he was a learner (Much like Obi Wan in this film) had a very dangerous Mentor (You will find out who he is later)SPOILERS END<BR>The Special effects are outstanding, but they relied on it too much and that is not good for people can still tell what is fake and what is real. Also I did not like the battle between the Gungans and the droid army it was too static and not chaotic (Watch episode 2 and you will see what I mean).<br />But the DVD is Aweson it  has a lot of cool special features like trailers and documentaries.<br />My final thought. Unlike the orinigal Star Wars this movie cannot stand on its two feet. It needs the following two episodes to be \\"complete\\". Enjoy the film if you don't mind an irritating Gungan.<br />(P.S. Make sure you get the Widescreen Verion an not the fullscreen. The Same applies for episode 2)
0064407667|5.0|This book is the best book ever written for children. It is filled with suspense and suspicion. From wonderful day at the beach to dead horrible day at the house of Count Olaf. While you read these you will be encouraged to read the other 8. I highly reccomend this book to all the readers out there.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This is the soundtrack to EMINEM movie 8 Mile. Although This album only had 3 EMINEM songs and a couple of song featuring him and some other songs by other rapper and hip-hoppers. All The tracks by EMINEM is great and also the tracks that featured him is great too. The movie's first cut LOSE YOURSELF also help him got his first ever Number 1 track in BILLBOARD HOT 100 Chart.<br />50 cents contributed 2 track here and i really like WANGSTA, PLACES TO GO is kinda average. D-12 Rap Game in my opinion is there greatest work to date, I really like that cut. The next two track is by NAS and JAY-Z, both of em don't like each other but for me, i prefer JAY-Z as he is betta than NAS but in here, Both track is good. The rest of the album seem kinda boring but i really loved the track Adrenaline Rush by Obie Trice. Macy Gray's track Is BAD. That's all i can say about the soundtrack, buy it if you are a rap/hip-hop lover.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman rocks. That's basically what I have to say. I wan't a Spiderman fan when I saw this movie in theatres, but the movie was awesome. It still is. This movie is about an ordinary teenager who gets superpowers. Then he has to save people, and stuff like that. Be a superhero. But he still has a crush on a girl he's known forever. This movie is great. It has action, sad stuff, parts that make you jump, and romance. Also, the DVD's special features are cool. It has info about how the movie was made, music videos ^_^, and tons of other stuff. I totally reccomend this movie, wether you're a Spiderman fan or not. It rocks.
0385484518|5.0|I would advise you to avoid reading this book if you do not wish to think about the choices you are making in your life, or do not like to get choked up and think of people you miss, or if you don't want to suddenly feel the need to hug your kids, then call your parents just to chat. It is a short, simple book and quick read, but if you have appointments to get to, people you need to control, or places and things that require your attention, this might get in the way of your plans. You might suddenly want to work in a garden, rock a baby, listen to music or sit quietly and relish how fortunate you are to be alive. <BR>If you are willing to take the risks that might be associated with reading this story, perhaps you will find that it was a very good way to spend your afternoon...perhaps you will find that you have some fresh ideas about how you will spend your next weekend...perhaps you will even find that you want to really think about how you will spend the rest of your life. Those are pretty impressive results for a short, simple book that's a quick read!
B000003BF4|5.0|Dude, this is the greatest \\"Sympathy\\" in the history of the world!!  This CD is great to begin with, but the \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" rendition they perform makes it one of the all time greatest albums in the history of mankind.  The \\"Jumping Jack\\" version is also pretty sick.  If you or any Stones fan you know does not have this disc, you must purchase it right now, for it is the greatest CD in the history of the Universe.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I know a lot of people who hate the Offspring, because of this CD, but I liked it. I like Smash better(because it is better), but this is definitely the CD to buy if you are uncertain about buying an Offspring CD. If you are downloading the songs, be sure to download Pretty Fly for a white guy, Why Don't You Get a Job, The Kids aren't Alright, and She's got Issues. If you liked the Kids aren't Alright better than any of the ones named above, BUY SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!
0767903862|4.0|This is one hilarious book! I was rolling on the floor while reading this!<br />If you have ever been to Australia you will quickly recognize what Mr. Bryson is talking about, if you haven't been you'll probably learn a little bit about the country as you go along.<br />Only one of Bryson's books oustshines this one - &quot;A Walk In the Woods&quot;.
B000002KD9|5.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and he loves it. He's a big Neil Young fan, but this particular CD was missing from his collection. The only thing that bothers me now, is that he plays this CD over and over and over.
B00006LLLN|5.0|There is something wonderful about a live CD and I love AKUS, so I knew I was in for a treat when this double disc set came out. I have not been disappointed, especially since disc one and disc two are equally great!<br /><br />Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski swap lead vocal duties, when they are not leading the rest of Union Station through the rollicking instrumentals. My favorite songs are &quot;Just Let Me Touch You For A While&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot; (Krauss' voice soars), the playful &quot;Oh Atlanta&quot; and the borderline depressing &quot;New Favorite&quot;. The crowd comes into play heavily - they eat up &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. At one point a heckler yells 'more' and Dan says 'this is not a race' - showing AKUS' not often seen playful side.<br /><br />For two CDs, the price is right and it is a wonderful mixture of old and new AKUS music, along with some bluegrass standards not appearing on any of their other CDs. Truly a must-have set!
B00003W8NM|2.0|This movie claims to be philosophically deep.  Yeah, right.  You're not fooling me, Mr. Fincher.  The philosophy here is quite shallow.  Some interesting surface points are made about commercialism, but it's all just an excuse for Fincher to show off his 875 different camera angles and blow stuff up on screen.
B000002A46|4.0|At times Mariah's voice is a little overwhelming, but she really brings these Christmas standards to life. My favorites are the rollicking &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; and the similarly themed &quot;Christmas (Please Come Home)&quot;. Another standout is &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&quot;. Backed up (and sometimes 'shown up') by a most impressive choir on the songs, this CD is a little more traditional and gospel than most holiday collections - but remains a favorite of mine.
B00005JKNF|2.0|This movie is frustrating to watch. There are so many characters that it should have provided viewers with a complementary roster. Also, the British accents get in the way of American comprehension. The movie lacks a concentration on any of the characters and when the end comes, viewers will be asking \\"so what\\" and \\"what's the point?\\" A murder mystery made boring.
0553106635|4.0|This was an excellent book from start to finish. Like the previous two in the series it kept me captivated for days while I poured through the pages. Not typically one to read fantasy, I have been impressed and subsequently hooked by Martin. Only thing to prevent this from getting a full five stars is its amount of plot twists packed into one book. Almost unbelievable, however Martin has a style that can somehow pull it off when others would likely fall short. Cannot wait for the next installment.
6305399212|3.0|This movie will not be winning any artistic achievement awards any time soon.  Neither does it function as a piece of entertainment that makes you think.  It's best to check your brain at the door before viewing this one.  The characters are almost ridiculously stupid, and the \\"space marines\\" act like a bunch of children with guns as opposed to trained professionals.  Of course, it's only a movie, but Cameron could have given us just a smidgen of more depth.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I think the adult should buy this dvd because it has lots of violents,nudity,gore,kill people too. And in the movie it is not the same video game you see at the video store and you look at the video game the games is mature. Why because if your child is like to kill all of the zombines in this game do not get this video game for them to get their birthday or their christmas present at all
B0000640VO|5.0|This masterpiece of cinematografy is destined to become an evergreen. In a hundred years ppl will still speak enthusiastically about this marvelous film.<br />One odd detail:<BR>There is not a single cussword in the whole movie, a brief moment of nudity maybe but that is all. It is refreshing to find a gem like this for a change.

B000002AVF|2.0|Amazon.com keeps reminding me that I haven't given my take on this particular Carey album.  I actually thought that I had done all that are in my collection.<br />Well, \\"Daydream\\" is no better or worse than the one that preceded it or the one that followed.<br />It just goes to support my belief that if you have one or two by the singer, you have them all.
B00000K31Q|5.0|All I have to say is that this is definitely one of my fave movies of all time. Great cast, story, and acting. Awesome movie.
