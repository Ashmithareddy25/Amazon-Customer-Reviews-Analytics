B000N3AWDE|3.0|I can't get into this one, and I'm a real big fan of Celine. I think the problem I have with it is that, unlike her other albums, the songs on D'elles don't seem to have a climax to them. I don't get the feelings behind the songs. I love Celine in both French and English but this album doesn't rank as a favorite for me.
B000002AP1|4.0|Update- February 14, 2014 (Happy Valentine's Day!)<br /><br />Sorry this album is clearly better than 2 stars.  I was probably not in a particularly open-minded mood when I first reviewed Raw Power.  It's raw!  It's actually the rawest album I've ever heard from the 70's and that has to count for something right?  It counts for a lot!  The vocal melodies are significantly better to me now as well.  When combined with the crunchy guitar riff, this is a winner of an album.  Not sure why or how I didn't notice this at first.  Well... we both know why- the album was simply too raw to appreciate!  It was overwhelming as a first time listener.  Anyway this album rules.<br /><br />This is my old review with my original feelings.  Yeah I was wrong but I'll leave it here for the fun of it.<br /><br />Raw Power is considered a masterpiece by many perhaps for featuring a radically different sound and influencing the punk rock genre, but really, Fun House is a MUCH better and easier listening experience.  I just can't tolerate what the band was trying to do on this release.<br /><br />That's my problem and you probably shouldn't listen to me since, after all, most people consider Raw Power a classic that influenced thousands of punk rock bands many years later (well, as soon as punk rock was considered an acceptable genre, which didn't happen until at least five years after this albums release.  I guess you could make an exception for the Ramones).<br /><br />For me though, Fun House has a more pleasing sound and features a better selection of songs as far as songwriting goes.  I guess I can't handle my hard rock to be *this* dirty.  A song like \\"Shake Appeal\\" is just... too nasty and uninteresting to me.  Whereas everything on Fun House is not nearly as nasty and just rocks exceptionally hard.  To me, that makes Fun House better.
B00102FELM|3.0|No arguing over the music here, it is absolutely great. However, I am sooo disappointed with the song selection on this DVD. If they had followed the concert tracklist this would have been the ultimate Scorpions document ever.<br /><br />This is because the concert tracklist was the result of a vote by the fans on the Wacken website before the event. The fans themselves selected the best Scorpions songs ever. Unsurprisingly, almost all songs that were chosen came from the classic 70's and 80's period. And that is precisely the reason why so many people were eagerly awaiting this DVD, to see these classic songs performed with the original artists (i.e. including Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Hermann Rarebell).<br /><br />So it is outrageous and unforgivable that several of the old classics performed that night, and that you cannot get anywhere on DVD with the original artists, (Dark Lady, He's a Woman, She's a Man, Dynamite, In Search of the Piece of Mind) were edited out!!! Instead, what they left in includes a drum solo, and some mediocre new songs that you can see on any Scorpions DVD....!<br /><br />This is so disappointing. The music industry has a sad history of deliberately crippling best of's and live concerts so that no \\"definitive\\" release can ever see the light, but this is one of the most blatant examples ever! (And don't tell me it is because they had some kind of technical problem that they eliminated those songs, because (a) the audio stream of the concert that you can find on the web sounds fine and (b) they claim that it is precisely because of remastering that it took them over a year to release this, so they had plenty of opportunities to remedy any problem). My advice: better wait until a proper version of this concert is released or circulated via p2p.
0007107927|3.0|This is the book that started it all. I was recently reorganizing my books and ran across a copy of the original version. I decided to reread it and was really a little dissappointed. I remember reading this back in the 80's and being quite impressed with it.<br /><br />So why was I not impressed with it twenty years later? Well, a few reasons. Back in the 80's, we bought our books at a place called a book store. There, you could actually thumb through the book before buying it. So, you could easily see that there wasn't much content. The book is 112 pages, but could have easily fit on half that number. Ah, the magic of formatting. Today, we buy our books online and cannot see that we are dupped into believing there is more content than what is actually here.<br /><br />Also, the basic concept here revolves around 3 simple principles, 1 minute goal setting, 1 minute praising and 1 minute reprimanding. There you have it. Don't get me wrong, this is great stuff to know and live by, but by today's standards, this is simply not enough content to warrant the price.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, by all means, get a copy. But don't pay $14.95 for it. It's easy enough to find a nice used copy for a couple of dollars.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|this is an awesome CD, way different than the others (witch i love get them too if you don't have).  i love all the songs on the self titeled. i like that A7X isn't afraid to change their sound they've done it with every album & they've done it well! i hate that a lot of people are calling them sellouts 'cause  they don't sound like they did in WTF (shut the F*** up you don't know what your talking about). if they do the same songs over & over, their going to get bored & not want to make music any more. A7X is the best thing that EVER happened to music, & i hope their around for a long time. keep it up A7X!!!!
B00008G9JN|5.0|Ian Anderson's voice seemed to get MUCH deeper and even *creepier* for this album.  Maybe it has something to do with the updated recording equipment they were beginning to use in the mid 70's.  Whatever the case, I love the way the music sounds.  It's louder and cleaner compared to previous Jethro Tull albums.  It almost sparkles it's THAT good!    Anyway, what matters most when listening to any Jethro Tull album is whether the songwriting is up to par.  Fortunately that's completely true with this release.  The popular belief back in the 70's that the band stopped being good after the Minstrel in the Gallery album is mind-boggling to me.  It's simply not true.      The tasty flute playing/jamming has remained, the crazy all-over-the-place singing style of Ian is still there, and the style of songwriting from all the older albums is also very much noticeable as well.      Again, it doesn't make sense how this album used to be considered a downfall of quality of some sorts.  I really don't think so.  Luckily in recent years people have approached the album with a more open mind, and now people are seeing just how GOOD it really is.    So basically, if you like all the 60's and 70's Jethro Tull albums, you will like Songs from the Wood as well, guaranteed.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce stretches his msucles on this album as he has on every one before. Sure, there are no \\"Born To Runs\\" or \\"Badlands\\" on here, it's mostly middle of the road, but the lyrics are deep. \\"A Long Walk Home\\" and \\"The Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" are 2 of my favorites. The latter being one of the most dreamy, vivid songs ever put down by anyone. You can smell the ocean and feel the oardwalk beneath your feet on that one, its just sounds like a Motown blast from the past and caught me off guard. We are going to see Bruce In Columbus On March 24, 2008 and I hope he inlcudes this one. This is not as intenses as the Rising, but it's no \\"Tom Joad\\" or \\"Nebraska\\" mellow thing either. Some of the tracks do sound like pre 1976 Springsteen to me, and the E Street Band has never been tighter. When we Saw them on The Rising Tour, it was the most Amazing vibe I've ever felt in the air at a concert, and I've seen everyone who's sold over 100 million records.
B000065V42|2.0|Too sad.  I have widescreen TV and this dvd is annoying.    It has only full screen format.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This is an excellent CD!!!  I keep playing it over and over.  This is the soundtrack for the book \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" by Nikki Sixx.  I purchased both the book and CD at the same time.  If you like Motley Crue and Nikki Sixx you will love this CD and the book.  Nikki Sixx is a very talented songwriter and musician and once again does not let his fans down.      The profits from Nikki's book are donated to his charity Running Wild in the Night with Covenant House that helps runaway kids.  Just one more reason to definitely buy the book along with the CD!!!  It is wonderful to see a celebrity who has gone down the dark road of addiction come full circle to recovery and then use his position and influence to try and help others.  Thumbs up to Nikki Sixx for being brave enough to expose his weakness in the hope of helping others!!    I highly recommend this CD!!!
B00000K3UU|5.0|Adam Sandler seems to spark negative opinions more often than not.  Some people don't like his style of humor, while other people just think he's overrated.  But in my opinion, he's a great actor who can be really funny at times, and sometimes not so funny.  It really just depends on the kind of story he's involved with for whatever movie he's in.    However, this is one really rare moment when his humor is not overbearing and completely tolerable for just about anyone to get into.  You have plenty of emotions where Adam and the child character communicate with each other in such a way where you can't help but enjoy Adam's character.  Every actor needs a movie like this in their long and winding career.    Sure, at the time we weren't sure if a comedian such as Adam Sandler would fit in with this kind of role in a movie.  Over time we see that yes, it worked very well.  Great movie.

0743486285|5.0|An Amazing Book!!!  Nikki Sixx bares his soul in this Diary.  Nikki exposes the devastating toll that his drug and alcohol addictions take on his life and those around him.  This book is filled with very graphic depictions of the life of a Rock Star who has it all and hits rock-bottom with his Heroin addiction and severe depression.           There are many reviewers who have criticized how sincere Nikki Sixx is in releasing this book and I have to wonder why they are being so hard on Nikki.  Releasing this book is a very courageous move on the part of this very famous and talented man.  Nikki Sixx could very well have kept all these horror stories to himself but instead he hopes that his story can hopefully help others.  In his Introduction he makes it clear why he has written this book.  \\"So why have I decided to publish these insane diaries and show the world just what a f*****-up, strung-out madman I was at the height of my success?  Well, it's simple.  If one person reads this book and doesn't have to go down the same road as me, it was worth sharing my personal hell with them.  I'm also donating profits from this book to help runaway kids at a charity I set up called Running Wild in the Night through Covenant House....  They say to keep what you have, you have to give it away.  I believe that....  If life is what you make it, I've made mine great.  It took a lot of hard work and if you need to, you can do it too.\\"          Nikki Sixx demonstrates his sincere desire to stay in recovery from his addictions; one of the surest ways to help stay on track is to reach out to others and try to help them avoid the route he took.  By writing this book to help others Nikki is able to help himself stay strong and stay drug-free.  As a celebrity he is able to reach out to so many people and he is using his position and influence in a positive way. It is wonderful that the profits from this book are donated to his charity Running Wild in the Night with Covenant House to help runaway kids!         This book is filled with hope and inspiration and can be useful to anyone who is going through a hard time and thinks things will never get better.  I highly recommend this book and the Soundtrack of the Heroin Diaries to any Motley Crue fan!  Thumbs up to Nikki Sixx for being brave enough to expose his weakness in the hopes of helping others.  May Nikki Sixx continue to remain sober, drug-free and free from the burdon of depression.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Heavy Horses is the one Jethro Tull album people seem to mention as the \\"most underrated\\" and for good reason- the quality of the songwriting is really good overall, and particularly the multi-part section of the title song is captivating to me.      The band was just running strong for so many years leading up to this point that it's totally understandable many people might be skeptical if the band was able to continue delivering the goods.  Luckily they WERE in fact able to live up to expectations, and this is exactly what a rock album should be like.      I think most people will find themselves enjoying this album more than they probably are thinking at the moment (if you are sitting out there unsure whether you'd like it or not, I mean).  It's great stuff.
0452289963|3.0|To anybody new to philosophy books. They will find it good and impressive. Many of them will find him wise and it will make them think. For those that read this stuff all the time it is just okay. It doesn't say anything new and express philosophy close to Buddhism. \\"Egoless\\" is the idea of this book in which is similar to their is no \\"I\\" of Buddhism philosophy. The mediation process is similar to Buddhism as well. This book disappoints because it is overhyped. The writing style kills me, too. Don't read the book just because it is recommended by Oprah like the person writing this review.
B000VS6P9Q|3.0|A bunch of indie/alt stars get together and pay tribute to Bob with a lot of covers. It's an uneven experience.  The most famous songs tend to come across worst.  Stephen Malkmus, Karen Oh or Cat Power trying to turn well worn phrases like 'you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is' into their own comes off very karaoke.  Other efforts work better.  Yo La Tengo demonstrate that Fourth Time Around is a song they were in fact born to cover (and what a great song--practically invented the passive-aggressive attitude towards romance that has defined indie-rock forever).  Eddie Vedder (with a lot of help from Tom Verlaine on guitar) pulls off an excellent All Along the Watchtower.  And the less famous songs, like John Doe's version of Pressing On, and Sufjan Stevens' Ring Those Bells, tend to work better.  However, there is a problem with the overall gestalt.  In his day, Dylan was incredibly audacious--ignoring his cult and crossing straight over into the world of pop.  By contrast, nearly all the performers here seem a little timid and smug.  Here's an alternative idea--how about an album with all the acts who manage to straddle that art/commercial divide today--Kanye West, Amy Winehouse, Daft Punk, etc.--covering Dylan.  Some of these acts are probably unfamiliar with his catalogue, and I'm sure that would be for the best.    I was tempted to add a star to my rating because of the inclusion of the previously unreleased Basement Tape, I'm Not There.  It is outstanding.
0765317389|5.0|This is touted as a book for young people. I was 50 years old when I read it. By that time I had been reading Sci-Fi for 40 years. This is one of the top sci-fi stories of all time. Even if you are too old for it.
B00007KWHO|4.0|Time and a Word is quite the drastic step away from their classic sound that Yes would immediately develop soon afterwards.  What makes it different, you ask?  The inclusion of an orchestration.  It definitely sounds WEIRD to me- a band like Yes using such a thing, and it's definitely not an appealing kind of weirdness either.  Don't expect much in the way of space rock, with the major exception being \\"Astral Traveller\\".  The rest of the album doesn't resemble a progressive rock/space rock band at *all*.  You can thank the heavy amount of orchestration for that.      I'll be totally honest- at first the orchestration was a distraction, because on a song like \\"No Opportunity Necessary\\" it's RIGHT upfront and impossible to overlook, forcing the listener to quickly make an adjustment and accept it in all its glaring awkwardness.  The good news is that, with a little bit of patience, you *can* in fact adjust to it.  The vocal melody on this particular track being exceptional certainly makes the adjustment period easier.      A song like \\"Then\\" is just a pure vocal melody delight with a really cool instrumental break in the middle.  Sure, the song sounds severely dated, but it's pretty good nonetheless.  The hardest song to get into by *far* is \\"Everydays\\" because the vocals are extremely quiet and slightly jazzy, quite often barely indicating a melody is actually taking place.  The guitar solo smack dab in the middle is perfection though, because every single note is just superb.      \\"The Prophet\\" has a passable keyboard solo in the beginning before a pretty satisfying vocal melody makes an appearance.  Not the best melody Jon Anderson ever delivered, but it's good enough I suppose.  \\"Clear Day\\" is a dated orchestrated ballad with a simple melody.  The title song is by FAR my favorite song on the entire album.  An absolutely breathtaking, gorgeous and melodic ballad with a vocal melody that makes flowers cry!      Overall, be warned with this one.  It's no Fragile or Tales From Topographic Oceans, that's for sure.  The heavy amount of orchestration can be distractingly upfront at times, but other than that minor problem (and the lack of space rock tendencies we'd soon associate with the band) the songwriting is pretty good and saves it.
B000YABYLA|1.0|First off, a disclaimer: I love independent films.  The quirkier the better!  When a movie like Happy Little Sunshine, or Memento comes out, I get excited because I know it's going to have a different point of view that appeals to all of my sensisibilities.  But, however, I did not like Juno because it sends a clear message to all unwed mothers and fathers that teen pregnancy is something worth laughing about.  It is no laughing matter!    First off, I should say that I do believe there was a great script written by Diablo Cody, and there are terrific performances by Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Batement.  It is really a stellar cast, and they really bring the story to life.  Also I will say that the soundtrack is top notch and I think the director did an excellent job from beginning to end.    First of all, it's not very believable that kids that young are going to get that pregnant at their age.  Some kids do have children when they're too young, but this movie is a comedy and should not be based on real life.  Also, the main characters all say twisted little cliches that are far really too clever to come from people who are are living in a dumb town.  Maybe people from New York talk that way, but come on!    I think, first of all, that this movie would have been better as a drama, because that's the kind of movies I like most.  But if it couldn't be a drama, then at least it should have been more like real life.  I'm not saying they should have made it a documentary (although I think Michael Cera would be very funny in one of those) but maybe they should have.  Teenaged pregnancy is a dicey issue for a lot of groups and Juno makes fun of how tough a situation it can be.    All in all, I think this is not a good movie to watch on DVD, but probably better on the big screen.  I think better luck next time to the filmmakers, actors, and writer of Juno!!!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Have been collecting this series for the past several years one season at a time. There was no UPN station in my area when the series first started and only got to see a few of the shows when the local Fox station picked it up.  But what I saw I liked. So to make a long story short all four seasons have been sitting here for about a year now and I haven't watched any of them! Recently I found myself stuck at home and the wife said why dont you start watching that Enterprise thing you bought. So I did and I am hooked. I have watched all of the other StarTrek shows and was a big fan of all of them. But I have to say IMO \\"Enterprise\\" ranks right there at the top.  I agree with an earlier post that suggested the shows undoing was the fact that it was on UPN.  My only complaint and its not a big deal, is the packaging...While it looks good and does a good job of protecting the disks, its just a little over done.  Bottom line,it is a good series and well worth adding to your collection.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|For years, I have been excited about the stargate series and must say I am a little bit concerned and confused about what happened to this production.  I totally agree with the comments about this DVD the \\"Ark of Truth\\" being overly hyped and I find that it fails miserably in the action arena and  most importantly in the script.  One of the most important aspects of the original series was that it took you to new and exciting places along with intellectually stimulating concepts.  What happened to the original SG 1 members?  What happend to the competent Carter and Teal'c?  I had to endure the entire movie watching them totally out of character with their former roles, while an inordinate amount of time is spent on developing the two newcomers, claudia black and ben browder, neither of which are at the same acting level of the original SG 1 team.  I found this DVD to be ridiculously similar to the series Farscape.  Why couldn't the story deal with the Ori and not the replicators again? To say I am disappointed would be mild and I will not buy the next DVD!
B000005IU1|5.0|The Stooges!  Back then they may have been considered an ordinary rock band who wasn't able to stand tall against bands like Led Zeppelin and Who, but today people look at the band in a totally different light- a band that was one of the first, if not THE first band, to have that rough punk rock sound, dirty and nasty.  It was different from everything else we've been exposed to up to that point in time.  I guess there was just too many revolutionary musical ideas going on back in the late 60's that the world of rock wasn't ready to appreciate something like this.      Of course Fun House is MUCH better, and there's one song on this debut album that's WAY too long and tries focusing on atmosphere and sort of fails as a result (leave that kind of stuff to Pink Floyd and King Crimson) but the shorter songs pack a punch that was *very* different at the time.  Don't worry about how heavy the songs are compared to subsequent releases by the band- just think about the time period in which it was released.
0380730405|5.0|since my inherent proclivities lie in the romance genre, i have to admit that i was a bit frustrated with the scant attention given on the relationship between Max and the heroine (whose name, now that i think about it (duh), was never made known.) but all THAT aside, this novel expertly conveyed the pervading menace and darkness that surrounded Manderley. from the first page and literally to the last, the author still has the reader in her grasp, and you just can't shake off the feeling that something sinister has yet to come.<br /><br />the insecurities that swamped the young heroine were excruciating as she found herself suddenly thrust in the role as the second wife of Manderley's master and walking in the shadow of its colorful late mistress, the beautiful Rebecca. the heroine continually feels as if she is a guest, and an unwanted one at that, in her own house. it didnt help that from the onset, she received a coldly hostile reception from the housekeeper and Rebecca's zealous champion, Mrs. Danvers.<br /><br />the author masterfully unfolded the pieces of the details surrounding Rebecca's life and death, making the novel nothing less than a page-turner in a reader's morbid desire to know the truth. apparently the late Mrs de Winter was the life of the demesne, the incomparable hostess that their social group almost venerate--and no one can replace her in Manderley.<br /><br />but even as she fumbles through the social mores her new life demands of her and grapples with the emotional barrage of having Rebecca's spectre in her married life, the readers can still discern strength of character in our heroine. through it all, Daphne du Maurier showed why her name remains a veritable force in the literary world as she invokes malevolence and fear brought forth by deadly secrets, and the destruction that encroaches on the soul and spreads to everything around you. provocative and memorable, Rebecca remains a true classic.
0783231202|3.0|Over the years since this film first came out it has received something of a love hate relationship with viewers. Amazon have provided their own review filled with the sneers and sarcasm that have resulted more from critics knee jerk pandering to the masses than serious critical review.  Others have pushed the old \\"political correct\\" Motive behind the film (For anyone who doesn't know, political correct roughly translates as \\"Something I disagree with, usually something I deem to be either left wing regardless of whether it is or not)<br /><br />What should not be taken for granted however is the level of emotion still felt by many African Americans regarding the trans Atlantic slave trade.  I first watched this film at a cinema in the United States and can recall (I assume) a black American walking out during the film with tears in his eyes clearly emotionally distressed at what he was seeing (It was during the scene describing the trans Atlantic journey when many were whipped, beaten and the sick thrown overboard.<br /><br />I seriously doubt however, that Spielburg under estimated the feelings of black Americans and while this film is certainly not of the quality of Schindler's List it certainly isn't ET.  To make that kind of comparison is frankly absurd.  My guess is Spielberg went for something based loosely on historical fact similar to Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />While the argument that the characters may well be one dimensional I assume a previous reviewer did not bother the watch the film before he reviewed it and declared it \\"politically correct\\" because the film clearly shows that Cinque was kidnapped by Africans and sold to Europeans.<br /><br />Spielberg does try to show the diversity of ethnic groups such as Muslims and Animist, one man seems to be taken by Christianity (a convert no less in such harsh circumstances!) The men speak in different languages and at times are argumentative amongst themselves (A comparison can be made to the imprisonment of Jews during WW2 and the disputes that arose between Jews of various nationalities)<br /><br />Speilburg tries hard.  He shows that the Spanish and Portuguese were the main participants in the slave trade (The British admiral giving evidence and yes, Britian did send out ships to attack Spanish and Portuguese slave traders) The conflict within the United States itself regarding slavery and the divide between north and a south that still relied heavily on a slave work force.<br /><br />Morgan Freedman provides us with the character of a black man born in the United States with no concept of slavery himself and no direct links with Africa.

B00064WSN2|3.0|I guess this is an improvement over the debut album from this revolutionary progressive rock band, but I can think of four albums by King Crimson you should hear before this one because they're better- Lizard, Islands, Larks Tongue in Aspic, and Red.  Four masterpieces.      In the Wake of Poseidon just has a few weak moments scattered through some highly memorable ones, but the thing is, there's no weak moments on the four albums I mention above.  Those are four brilliant masterpieces that you must own as soon as you can.    \\"Pictures of a City\\" has some nice jazzy parts, but the vocals are horrible, and the sound quality is atrocious.  \\"Cat Food\\" is probably the best song for being an atmospheric jazzy piece.  The title song is just a rewrite of what was done better on the debut.  Or maybe not (I like this song a lot despite not really being much different from the stuff the band had already done previously).  \\"Devil's Triangle\\" has an atmosphere that really doesn't do anything for me except get under my skin a little bit for being WAY too long.  The atmosphere never really goes anywhere.    Not one of the bands better albums, that's for sure.

1400095204|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun, superbly written by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, details the human side of the war between Biafra and Nigeria.  We see the details of how the achievements of their culture and their social order are demolished by a terribly mismatched pair of enemies.  Characters that are rich in personality and history become real and often dear to us as they suffer through the horrors of the 1967-70 war.  Obdenigo, a revolutionary zealot, becomes more and more muted as his people's lives degrade.  Kainene, a brisk and cynical businesswoman, achieves heroic proportions.  Richard, apparently weak and ineffectual, finds the strength and the words to describe the horrors of the war to the outside world.  If a test of a novel is the degree to which life events change people, this novel succeds on all fronts.  I also learned a bit of history.
B00005HYH9|5.0|Some people believe Obscured by Clouds is just as good as Dark Side of the Moon and in fact resembles the album on several occasions too.  They may be right!    You can definitely tell the band had a firm hold on the sound and style they were going for, but I'm not even sure the band members were aware their music was going to explode in terms of popularity starting with the next release.      However, let's talk about Obscured by Clouds.  Pink Floyd were always good with atmosphere.  Masters, in fact.  Revolutionary masters to be more specific.  Every single moment on this disc is brilliant to me.  Top notch songwriting as well.  That's really all you need to know.

0141182601|5.0|this was an interesting read. thankfully i read the book before i watched the movie, because although the movie was semi awesome, the ending killed the final point the author made, which was that all of the stuff alex did, the crimes n such, were a product of his youth. he did it because 'kids are crazy like that' but eventually they grow out of it. now of course whether this statement was intended to be read literally or symbolically is debatable and i'm sure a couple of hours could be devoted to taking that apart, but as it stands, that point, which i would say is quite significant, was left out of the movie, which i found disappointing.<br /><br />the book was great though. the concept it explores is in the title itself -a clockwork orange. an orange that is not allowed to be as nature intended but is being forced to transform itself and act according to the dictates of others. it is being forced to act this way through a technological means, rather than societal influences, though i'm sure one could link social pressures to the situation. the orange of course would be alex and the clockwork bit would be the treatment he was given to make violence repulsive to him. This treatment doesn't change the fact that he is inclined to commit violent acts, it just prevents him from doing so, taking away his free will. great imagery, i enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />its also cool how the author creates his own language. this effectively encapsulates the terms created by youth and only understood by youth, without putting a timeframe on the story by using actual slang from a certain time period.<br /><br />great story, definitely check it out.
055357342X|5.0|George R. R. Martin has outdone himself in this, the third tome in his wickedly-entertaining \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" fantasy series.  Yes, the series started off at a ploddingly slow pace with \\"A Game of Thrones\\", but the second book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" picked up the pace and the plot got better.  This third book improves on the previous two, on just about every aspect.  The pacing is faster, the plot is \\"tighter\\", and the story is finally moving forward.<br /><br />The land of Westeros is still in chaos and turmoil.  The smallfolk continue to suffer as the Great Lords play their \\"game of thrones\\".  Meanwhile, against this epic backdrop of war and political maneuverings, characters both great and small gradually reveal their own desires and motivations.  Through many twists and turns, the plot will delight you, surprise you, shock you, and might even anger you.  Old values, beliefs, alliances, and friendships will be shattered.  New alliances are built.  The old Gods now give way to the powerful flame god from overseas.<br /><br />Jon Snow returns to Castle Black, with a wildling woman he has taken under the sheets.  Meanwhile, his trusty side-kick, the self-described craven, Samwell Tarly has taken it upon himself to rescue a wildling woman from a band of rebel crows.  Robb Stark betrayed Lord Walder Frey and now attempts to mend the broken alliance after realizing that he cannot win without the help of House Frey.  The Kingslayer, under the escort of Brienne the Beauty, slowly reveals himself through a series of conversations with the maiden from Tarth.  Tyrion, ever-clever, slowly tries to regain his political power within King's Landing, and gains himself a new paramour in the process.<br /><br />Daenerys Stormborn, the last of the Targaryens, continue to gather followers, admirers, soldiers, and enemies.  As her power grows, so do the list of those who would stop her.  Meanwhile, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion continue to grow stronger.  Stannis, the King in the Narrow Sea, has been broken, with no one to turn to but the priestess and sorceress, Melisandre.<br /><br />Many, both high and low, will fall.  And the dead will rise again.  Winter is coming.  The long night is coming.  Old heroes will die and new ones will rise to take their place to face the new evil that is about to unleash itself unto the world.  And your friend and reviewer, the ever-humble Citan, can only look forward to the next installments in the series with great hope and excitement.e Narrow Sea, has been broken, with no one to turn to but the priestess and sorceress, Melisandre.<br /><br />Many, both high and low, will fall.

B000WAEK0E|4.0|This is like the 4th Van compilation in recent times and is a greatly  expanded version of the single disc greatest hits collection of the same name. The compiler did a wonderful job of stringing together 3 great sounding discs that flow in a wonderful manner. Most of the absolute \\"musts\\" are here on this set and the remaining choices sound so good together that it's hard to quibble. HOWEVER, we Van fans MUST quibble, mustn't we? What, no Caravan? Blue Money? ANYTHING from 'A Period of Transition'? Kingdom Hall? Haunts of Ancient Peace? Satisfied? Thanks For The Information? Got To Go Back? I'm Not Feeling It Anymore? Etc. , etc., etc. Any long-time van fan can make their own list of \\"musts\\" (and probably will) that were missed. BUT, despite my title's disclaimer, this is THE definitive collection (so far) and it sounds SO wonderful as a whole. This will get a LOT of play on my dansette. At least until they make a 4 disc box set and let me be the compiler!!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I love this movie. It's gritty, dark, and intense as only Michael Mann knows how to make his movies. I love Mann's style of making crime dramas. If you enjoyed Heat, and Miami Vice, then you'll appreciate Mann's work here. He uses that similar dark style of filming that pretty much takes place throughout the course of an evening, so that way he can capture different light angles and images that come out from everyday street life. He really enjoys making a film that takes place at night and in the big city so he can fully encompass that city life type of atmosphere. It's a crime drama, it's in a big city, it's a professional scenario. Aside from Mann's brilliance in directing, I will boldy go out on a limb and say that this is Tom Cruise's best acting role to date. He's usually an over-the-top actor that is rarely believable, but I thoroughly enjoyed his role as a stoic hitman who doesn't show emotion, but is just as witty as the next guy.  Jamie Foxx plays your typical dopey cab driver who is always aspiring to leave the cab, but knows he lacks that one spark to make him do it.  Well that fire is ignited once he lets Tom Cruise's character into his cab for what he thinks will be just a regular cab ride. If you're a fan of the movies Heat and Miami Vice then you'll like Collateral for its simple storyline but amazing cinematography and dialogue pretty much between two characters in Vincent and Max.<br /><br />Keep Michael Mann on your radar if you haven't already.  I hope he comes out with dozens of more films like this.
B00005JPTK|5.0|This is a very good movie. although it may not even look good it has very suspensful moments that will make you jump(about 3 or 4). it is still very good. And Will Smith is brilliant. I see why Entertainment Weekly (great mag) named him one of the 50 Smartest people in Hollywood. If youre not sure 2 buy it (y not) then rent first. Tattoo the Miracle
B0013FBS20|3.0|First let me say that I'm an avid Blu-Ray High Def fan, and that I love watching movies in high definition.  I am Legend is a great concept, and Will Smith puts on a fantastic performance.  However, I can't help but feel a bit empty by the ending of the movie - I liked watching it but there seems like no satisfaction towards the end of the film.  I just felt wanting more at the end, and that the whole film was built to end rather blunt and uneasy.    Without giving too much away; the film is enjoyable, and Will Smith gives a FANTSATIC performance...I just felt a bit empty when it came towards the end.
B000E97HIA|4.0|Since his 1978 debut, Prince has been known for his eccentric and synthetic music production, layered R&B grooves, taboo lyrics, and his irresistible and instantly recognizable falsetto (see \\"Kiss\\"). 3121 finds the bad-boy pop-prodigy in regular form, although the edgy, sexualized words have subsided some since his more recent conversion to Jehovah's Witness. Don't let this frighten you; the absence of such content is hardly noticeable because the alternate lyrical quality, and of course, the music, are so damn good...READ THE FULL REVIEW HERE: [...]
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I have almost all of Madonna's albums and I really dig this album. Out of the album there are 3 songs I'm not fond of... I Love New York, How High, and Push. Honestly, I can't put my finger on why I don't like them... they just don't flow like the others.    All the other songs have a great groove and I can just bop along to. It's not pop stuff like in the 80s, more electronica type of dance music. But it's really good.    I listened to this cd when it first came out and decided to listen to it again and it's still just as good. Standouts for me are Jump, Sorry, Get Together, Future Lovers.    My favorite albums from Madge are... Madonna (the 1st one), Bedtime Stories, American Life, Immaculate Collection and Ray of Light, if that helps in your decision making.    Enjoy.
0671024256|5.0|King is one of my favorite fiction writers overall. His ability to draw the reader in while delivering excellent stories is rarely matched, especially in the horror genre. \\"On Writing\\" shows the reader two additional facets: human being and teacher. The book begins with a story of King's life, with emphasis on family and how he developed the perspectives and talents in those early years that would serve him well later in life as an author. It tells the story of how Carrie, his first published novel, moved from the trash heap to a lucrative paperback deal. Along the way, he comes across as both honest concerning his struggle to make his stand as a writer and generous with praise, especially for his wife Tabitha.     The second part of the book focuses on writing advice. King avoids being pedantic here, opting instead to simply speak from what is obviously a wealth of experience. He brings great (and often forgotten, at least in my case) ideas back to the foreground, including Strunk's admonition: \\"omit needless words\\". This is a simple truth in writing that I find myself missing so often, even on second and third drafts. He repeats a formula from a letter he received regarding one of his earlier works - \\"2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10%\\".    Amen. I'm sure that some of my professors from a few years back would agree with that. My ten page final papers somehow always managed to become fifteen or even twenty pages. If I can learn to follow at least half of the advice King presents, I'll be doing much better.     The final section talks about his accident. I was not aware at the time it happened just how bad he had been injured. It's amazing that he came out of the whole thing intact and ready to sit down at the Mac again to write so soon after.     This is definitely a good read, both for fans and writers. Highly recommended.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I asked for this dvd set for my birthday, because I remember this being such a great show, and how heartbroken I was when it was canceled.  Well, it's even better than I remembered, and the bonus is, my whole family loves it and can't wait to view each new episode.  I have two teenagers now, and I think Angela and her friends really strike a chord with them.  The clothes may be dated to the 90s, but the depiction of teen life and its trials and tribulations resonates today.  Angela's parents, their desires, worries, and struggles also feel very real and very powerful.  Claire Danes was so unaffectedly beautiful, it is mesmerizing to behold.  If this kind of drama were made today, it would be HBO and there would be lots of f-bombs and such, which, incredibly, are not even missed because the writing is so good, so intelligent, the teens sound real without it.  If you are unfamiliar with this series, you are in for a treat.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is great. My first hearing of Davis was Sketches of Spain, which is good, but took a while to grow on me. This one, on the other hand, jumps out immediately as a top-shelf package. One listen and you'll be humming the tunes. Two or more and you'll be positively hooked. In my opinion, Kind of Blue is compositionally his best album. Same goes for the overall \\"cool\\" factor. The whole disc is smooth and elegant, varying in nuance and tone throughout and giving each musician a chance to step up and show off a bit. Great work that deserves high honors.
0321544080|2.0|McNally is a fantastic photographer, no doubt. His career has been an amazing one. But for average schmucks like you and me, this book will have little value. I echo the comments of others, in that how many of us are going to stand on the top of the antenna of the Empire State Building or shoot celebrities with all sorts of huge, expensive lighting equipment? 95% of the book explains how his shots were made by explaining the lighting. So basically this book is 95% about lighting. Very complicated, large lighting set-ups, mostly.     I just turned the last page today, and I'm putting it up for sale on eBay. Save your money - don't bother with this unless you're a fanatic off-camera lighting, stobist-type. Not that there's anything wrong with that ...
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I am very surprised that this isn't higher in star value.  This along with Pride and Prejudice, and North and South are my all time 3 favorites.  I think she was persuaded her whole life to do for others what they wanted her to do and in the end....well I don't want to ruin the movie for those that want to see it.       I absolutely love this movie!
0972169504|4.0|I had to wait for about a Month to get my hands on this book (shipping to Malaysia from the US seems to take a long time) but it was worth the wait. Very nicely done and the quality of the book is very good. The comic strips are nice and hillarious...As a PhD student, what Cham says in his comics really apply to your day to day life and this makes this comic strip really special.....    Any Postgrad student who's interested in purchasing this book, don't think twice go ahead and order now!!!....I myself am thinking of ordering the remaining two books in future....

When you listen to it again, it's impossible not to realize how amazing of a production this truly was and still is, even now 25 years later.  Every single song is a hit, and Michael moves through genres including pop, rock and R&B with ease, nailing each one.<br /><br />It's clear to anybody who follows R&B that so many artists over the past 10 years have made careers essentially emulating Michael's singing style and dance moves.

Let me tell you, it takes quite a performer to pull off a rhinestone shirt, rhinestone socks, sparkly jacket, high-waters and one white glove!<br /><br />It's amazing to note that Michael Jackson actually wrote most of the biggest hits on this album, something today's R&B artists rarely do.

0596007124|4.0|I've read 25% of the book and I'm very pleased with it.    I like its informal style, although you might find they sometimes abuse of their jokes and funny pictures. In my opinion, the authors manage to get you reading more and more (and what's most important: learning).    Behind its appearance of a funny book there's a serious work. The authors help you learn the most important patterns and how they follow the OO programming principles (this is important, that's why those patterns are good).

B000MNP2KI|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action scenes, stunts, and special effects.<br />*Excellent picture quality and cameramanship. Very different style.<br />*Excellent portrayal of James Bond; the best since Sean Connery. Daniel Craig best captures a roughness and attitude that the other Bond films lacked (and the original novels actually had).<br />*It's largely accurate to the original novel. Numerous liberties with the story serve to make it updated for modern times.<br />*Good portrayal of other characters.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*It's kind of long.<br />*Strange continuity; it's a prequil, but takes place after all the other Bond movies (it's probably better to think of this as a whole new saga).<br /><br />As an adaptation of Ian Flemming's novel \\"Casino Royale,\\" this definately the best, since previous adaptations have been pretty bad. As a Bond film, it's also one of the best, because it's very exciting, stylistically different, and sheds new light on Bond's character. The franchise has finally broken free of the usual James Bond corniness, and told a strong, original story with a strong central character. I hope that the trend continues, for this is the way Bond was meant to be.

See my awards summary at the bottom for more on this.<br /><br />It's clear to anybody who follows R&B that so many artists over the past 10 years have made careers essentially emulating Michael's singing style and dance moves.  You can include on that list:<br />- Justin Timberlake - [[ASIN:B000H305U0 FutureSex / LoveSounds]]<br />- Chris Brown - [[ASIN:B000C5E6QC Chris Brown]]<br />- Usher - [[ASIN:B0000013H7 My Way]]<br />- Omarion - [[ASIN:B0007GAEY4 O]]<br /><br />Record labels have an army of very intelligent number crunchers that clearly realized the marketing potential of putting some top stars together to add remakes to this anniversary edition.  The remakes can't possibly match Michael's original accomplishment.  Yet they are not as bad as many say.  I actually like the Akon version of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin.\\" And Kanye West's \\"Billie Jean\\" mix really highlights his abilities as a producer.<br /><br />The included DVD includes the short film music video versions of \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller.\\"  These videos are historic in their own right, each one a high budget production better than a lot of the movies made in 1982.<br /><br />There's also the Motown 25 performance of \\"Billie Jean.\\"  For those that don't remember this performance, it's the one where Michael first does the moonwalk on stage.  Let me tell you, it takes quite a performer to pull off a rhinestone shirt, rhinestone socks, sparkly jacket, high-waters and one white glove!<br /><br />There's also a nice liner jacket with all the original lyrics and cool album art.  Even more is included with the fold-out casebook version of this release.  [[ASIN:B001041JLE Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller(Deluxe Casebook Edition)]]<br /><br />It's amazing to note that Michael Jackson actually wrote most of the biggest hits on this album, something today's R&B artists rarely do.  Most of the biggest hits from the album are his original works, including \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" \\"The Girl Is Mine,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" and \\"Billie Jean.\\"  \\"Baby Be Mine,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" and \\"The Lady In My Life\\" were written and composed by Rod Temperton.  \\"PYT\\" was the work of the legendary James Ingram and Quincy Jones.  And Steve Porcato wrote both \\"Human Nature\\" (with John Bettis) and the newly released \\"For All Time\\" (with Michael Sherwood), number 16 on this edition.<br /><br />I really liked this previously unreleased track, and it definitely has a sound akin to Human Nature. I can only speculate that that similarity is what kept it off of the original release.<br /><br />It's amazingto think this album won 8 Grammys, and I don't even believe it was close in any category.<br />+ Album of the Year<br />+ Record of the Year (\\"Beat It\\")<br />+ Best Male Pop Vocals (\\"Thriller\\")<br />+ Best Male Rock Vocals (\\"Beat It\\")<br />+ Best Male R&B Vocals (\\"Billie Jean\\")<br />+ Best R&B Song (\\"Billie Jean\\")<br />+ Producer of the Year (Qunicy Jones and Michael Jackson)<br />+ Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical (Bruce Swedien)<br /><br />And there must not have been awards for best music video back then because \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" and \\"Beat It\\" would have all been nominated.<br /><br />This is a pivotal album that is well done here at an affordable price when you factor in all the cool stuff that's included.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!m of the Year  + Record of the Year (\\"Beat It\\")  + Best Male Pop Vocals (\\"Thriller\\")  + Best Male Rock Vocals (\\"Beat It\\")  + Best Male R&B Vocals (\\"Billie Jean\\")  + Best R&B Song (\\"Billie Jean\\")  + Producer of the Year (Qunicy Jones and Michael Jackson)  + Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical (Bruce Swedien)    And there must not have been awards for best music video back then because \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" and \\"Beat It\\" would have all been nominated.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have read some of the reviews and it seems that some folks have a hard line stance about the purification of Beatles music. Here is what you take with you from this movie. The movie is a glimpse into the 60's.  From the beginning of the Beatles era to the end. In this movie you will find little visual gifts.    There are references to Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Joe Cocker who actually plays Joe Cocker.  There are visual scenes which mimics the John and Yoko bed photo which Annie Leibovitz snapped a shot of.     It is a journey from simple times to war times and the introduction of drug experimentation and how the Beatles music followed the essence of the times.    Yes don't get upset that the music is not a perfect rendition of the Beatles music and who would want that. Heck I would just go out and buy the same ole Beatles music I bought 30 years ago.    What you get is the spirit of living through the 60's. with the interpreted style of the Beatles music as a story line.    Awesome and remember able. Please make sure you buy the two disk version. The second disk about the filming of the movie made was mind opening on how much heart the actors put into this film.    You will enjoy this journey through the 60's.
0452289963|5.0|I am amazed at the ability Eckhart Toile has to describe deep and profound philosophy in terms that almost anyone can understand (even those who have not studied philosophy or religion.)<br />Certainly these ideas have existed for thousands of years.  The eighteenth century Transcendentalists described the same beliefs.  Reading this book sent me back to Emerson's essays on Nature and the gnostic gospels.  The teachings of Jesus ( although we have been deprived of many of his deeper thoughts by the council of Nicea) refect this same idea of the divinity of man and nature.  New Age-what a joke.  These ideas are as Old Age as it gets.<br />So much more to say-but read the book.  He says it so lucidly.  An inspired teacher with depth and understanding that I believe are inspired by what we who call ourselves Christians call the Holy Spirit, he deserves to be heard by those who truly search for \\"righteousness.\\"

0743496736|4.0|I enjoyed this book and I wasn't sure that I would. I had read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and was blown away with the story. I had not read anything by Jodi Picoult until then, so I wanted to read another of her books. \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is such a very difficult subject to write a story about, but after I began, I couldn't put it down. I did'nt care for the ending but others may love it.
B000BYA5G4|3.0|This is a pretty good film about a man who self-actualizes the corruption that is in the deepest part of his soul as a black market arms dealer.  Cage narrates this life - out only for himself, regardless of who he helps to kill - and it is effective to a degree.  We witness his rise, his many ruses to avoid prison or execution, and its repercussions on his personal life.  I admit, Cage's dark humor and splendidly indifferent tone are at times funny and affecting.  But the best characterizations, I think, are in the people he encounters, from the cold rival arms dealer he fights to the brutal African thug who makes him rich.  It is very good acting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is Hollywood trying to display some social conscience.  There is a kind of breathlessness to it, like they are revealing something to the audience, almost as reporting, but I found its sincerity rather naive.  While it is good to expose audiences to this, I suppose, the tone of the film implies that none of us know about these kinds of people already.  (I, for one, have been following the issue since 1982, when I read The Global Politics of Arms Sales,  by Andrew Pierre, which is a great academic masterwork, or Anthony Sampson's reporting on it from the early 1980s.)<br /><br />There is no way you can say airing these issues is bad.  Recommended for those who haven't follwed the issue of international arms trafficing.

B0011NVC98|4.0|...To paraphrase a line from the actual poem.  I was only mildly curious about 'Beowulf' when we rented it.  Being a fan of the poem, I was interested to see what this surreal cast (Ray Winstone?  John Malkovich??  Angelina Jolie???) were going to make of it.  I expected it would be camp fun.  Instead, it was unexpectedly grand, epic, and rather moving.  I gather Robert Zemeckis hates the poem, which suits my idea of him as an ignorant schmuck who doesn't recognise good material when he sees it, and enables me to give all the credit for the story to both the Beowulf-poet himself and to Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, who wrote the screenplay.    They've only really done one thing to the story to make it a fully-fledged Hollywood movie, and I won't give it away here but it makes a certain kind of sense, and certainly makes for a more satisfying movie than the original poem would have been if they'd just left it as it was.  Those who didn't like this film but haven't read the poem might be surprised to learn that there are passages of dialogue that have been lifted almost word-for-word from the original, such as when John Malkovich's cynical and snobbish counselor Unferth challenges Beowulf about a swimming contest that he (Beowulf) had lost.  The CGI acting is a lot better than some people seem to think - Robin Wright Penn's character in particular is remarkably expressive and touching.  And despite what the Amazon editorial says, Angelina Jolie's is not like a rubber doll, but actually slightly more realistic-looking than Angelina Jolie herself (I think they toned down the lips a bit).      There's some top-class smiting, enjoyable turns from Anthony Hopkins as the complacent king Hrothgar (nicely expanding on hints in the original story) and Brendan Gleeson as Beowulf's hairy sidekick Wiglaf, yet another in Brendan Gleeson's line of memorably hairy sidekicks.      Oh yeah, and that accent that nobody can seem to figure out?  It's Welsh.  At least, Hopkins is doing Welsh, so Wright does the same thing, closely followed by most of the serving wenches and Alison Lohman as Beowulf's girlfriend (although by the time it gets to her it's just gone kind of weird).  Meanwhile, Gleeson is doing inner Dublin, Winstone is doing East End of London and Malkovich is just doing Malkovich.  But who cares?  Crispin Glover's dialogue is entirely in Old English and his mother appears to be from Serbia.  Just sit back and enjoy.    'Beowulf' is underrated.  The story is in most important respects faithful to the original and, where it isn't, comments intelligently upon it from a distance of a thousand years.  I'm not totally convinced that it wouldn't have been as good if they'd done it as a mixture of live action and animation, but then they'd have had a whole cast and crew freezing their knees off in Denmark somewhere and the production would have been less happy all round.    I love the poem but it makes sense on its own terms as a poem; it wouldn't be as good a movie if you just filmed it.  They had to do something to it to make it into a movie, and I'm glad it was this.  To translate the title of this review from (mostly) Old English: that was good cinema.  Check it out.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is the best James Bond film in some time. The story is set at the very beginning of Bond's career (he's just been promoted to Double-Oh status) and Daniel Craig is a very believable rough-edged, not entirely self-assured agent who falls in love with a woman he's willing to resign his career for. But since I've seen all or most of the films in the series, beginning with \\"Dr. No\\" in 1962, continuity dictates that the beginning of Bond's career should logically have been set during the Cold War of the late 1950s -- not in the 21st century world of terrorism, cell phones, and Texas Hold'Em. (The original novel, of course, was set even earlier, in 1953.) It's as if the previous films in the franchise didn't exist. The stunts and the chase scenes are great and there's relatively little reliance on bizarre spy technology (except for a suspiciously convenient defibrilator in the gove compartment), and the relationships are key to the story for a change. And the parkour chase sequence in Madagascar was amazing, as was the the building-collapse scene in Venice. Even the open credit sequence was much more restrained than usual. Finally, the only really familiar face among the cast is Judi Dench as a very tough \\"M,\\" which allows the story to take precedence over the actors. Mads Mikkelsen is especially creepy as Le Chiffre, and Eva Green (as Vesper Lynd) and Caterina Murino (as Solange) are sufficiently attractive without being Barbie Dolls. I rather miss \\"Q\\" and Miss Moneypenny, though. I understand a direct sequel to this one will be out soon (another Bond film first) and I shall be watching for it.
B000025XKM|5.0|I didn't get into the album at first; mostly listened to the title track. But one day I listened to it while stressed out over a test, and kept listening over and over. The songs are lovely, simple, and always leave you wanting more. Nick Drake has a fantastic voice perfectly matched to his songs, which are best heard in a car with the windows down at night, looking at the stars through the moonroof.   My favorite tracks besides Pink Moon are Road, Which Will, and Things Behind the Sun, but all are excellent.
0374280967|5.0|Out doing walkees one day behind the palace, Queen Elizabeth's corgis drag her over to a novel sight: a mobile library van parked weekly at the staff entrance. Her Majesty steps inside, meets a gawky ginger-haired young dishwasher picking out his next book (on Cecil Beaton, our first clue about him) and starts her own unfamiliar hobby: book reading. Her first title, by Ivy Compton-Burnett (a witty inside joke), leads to a sustained compulsion that totally recasts her duty-bound life. This perfect novella is a paean to the illuminations offered by reading, and Bennett's portrait of the Queen and her world is as subtle and piercing as that of the recent movie, and like that movie, it can be consumed painlessly in one sitting.
0743454537|2.0|A Point of View Nightmare<br />The first thing that caused my eyebrows to furrow with My Sister's Keeper was when Jodi Piccoult inserted a grown woman's thoughts into a thirteen year old's head. The character Anna compared her lawyer's name to a very expensive bar drink:  \\"Campbell Alexander....it sounds like a bar drink that costs too much, or a brokerage firm.\\"  In my opinion, not even the most mature thirteen year-old in the world would even know what a brokerage firm is or know enough about drinking to have a passing thought such as that.<br /><br />When I first began reading this book, I found the plot amazing, yet when I saw that the point of view was changing from chapter to chapter, it became difficult to follow.  Sometimes I would forget whose thoughts I was reading.  What was even more distracting was when Sara's thoughts reached back in time to when Kate was first diagnosed with her disease.  I felt like Jodi Picoult was skipping around all over the place.  It just seemed so unorganized.  Sara's chapter overwhelmed me with medical words and conditions.  Although it was necessary to describe Kate's sickness, I feel that Jodi Piccoult could have done so without overwhelming the reader with details that only nurses and doctors could appreciate reading.<br /><br />I was about one third of the way through this book when I practically gave up and just began reading Anna's and the lawyer's point of view.  And even then, I found myself skipping every double paragraph space I approached because I knew that Anna or the lawyer was about to launch off into a childhood memory or irrelevant muse that would pull from the forward flow of what was going on at the time.  Then there was the lawyer's love interest.  Where did that come from?  It was out of place and seemed to be added to appeal to readers who couldn't read books that didn't have romance.  It just sounded as though Piccoult was trying to appeal to too many different audiences in this novel.  The firefighter's experiences, the arsonist, the flashbacks in time, unnecessary theme of romance, and point of view changes had my brain all muffled.  It gave me the impression this should have been several books instead of one because the storyline about the strained relationship with the parents and Anna; her sick sister, and the lawsuit was strong enough to stand on its own.<br /><br />To find out the result of the lawsuit, I forced myself to read chunks here and there until I made it to the end.  Although no mother should experience this type of tragedy, I actually felt Sara deserved what happened to her in the end.  I won't judge an author by one book, and since I have heard and read so many positive reviews about her novels, I won't give up on Jodi Piccoult.  I'll try another one of her novels and see what happens.e arsonist, the flashbacks in time, unnecessary theme of romance, and point of view changes had my brain all muffled.

B000002AH9|4.0|The name really does say it all. This is Holiday at her smoothe, silky best. When it comes to female jazz singers, a lot of fans like to break off into various camps: Camp Holiday, Camp Fitzgerald, Camp Simone, Camp Vaughn, etc. I'm not one of those people. I listen to jazz singers to work on and improve my jazz music phrasing. So to start, I get different experiences and learn different things from different singers, making me a Holiday fan, but certainly no basher of any other singer. Listening to any of the above singers is beneficial and enjoyable, but make no mistake: They are different. For me, I have always liked Billie Holiday because, if you know the notes, when you listen to her sing, you aren't always sure she's going to get where she needs to go in the number of beats/measures she has left to get there. But somehow, she always does. Some of the tracks on this CD are shining examples of her ability to take a phrase, soak it down, wring it out, and put it back into an unexpected but pleasing shape. Probably the best example of that is track 3, \\"You don't know what love is\\". The selection of songs on this CD leaves a little to be desired, but at the same time, the alternate takes really are \\"alternative\\", so the listener gets to experience different aspects of the same song, which makes the listening all the more challenging, but rewarding. In short, I always enjoy this CD and I come back to it quite often. Casual jazz fans looking for a compilation to add to their collection could probably do better with [[ASIN:B000003N36 Billie Holiday: The Complete Decca Recordings]], but it is more expensive than this CD. Serious jazz fans familiar with Ms. Holiday and wanting a broader introspective, on the other hand, will not be disappointed with this work.
0345444051|5.0|This book is one of the greatest classic and most influential works that I have ever read. Not only that, it is also the most prophetic novel as it seemed to reveal the culture to which we now live: a new generation being absorbed to a greatest extent in the worlds of cyberspace and mass media where we might as well be under the control of the extraterrestrial intelligence. This is certainly a book that cannot be put down, as I would surly recommend it.<br /><br />I won't bring here a spoiler, but to say that this book will certainly leave you as uncertain as well wanting to know more and also not knowing what outcome will be. It is very easy to read and relatively a short book. I was quite amazed at the fact that this book was written over a half a century ago because I felt this book is very relevant today as it was then. It is both terrifying and most certainly an eye-opening read.<br /><br />Recently, the author Arthur Clarke has passed away and he will greatly be missed. His works and legacy has the greatest impact on the modern culture. His classic works, especially \\"Childhood's End\\" and [[ASIN:0451457994 2001: A Space Odyssey]] are highly memorable.

B00005JN0T|4.0|I ROBOT, starring Will Smith, was a fine four star movie having an interesting plot, good acting, fine direction and lots of action.  I think the film was almost too ambitious from the point of view of special effects. Will Smith stated that I ROBOT had more special effects than any film he has made to date, including INDEPENDANCE DAY. Although I really appreciate good effects, I would have preferred some more of Will Smith's entertaining acting, something he was permitted to deliver in I AM LEGEND. He was too much of a stunt man in this film.  I also found the full scale mechanical effects to be much more credibly done than the abundant computer graphics which though beautiful, looked a bit too stylish giving certain portions of the film the appearance of anime.<br /><br />In the literary sense, the original laws of robotics were invented by Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific science fiction writers of the 20th century and certainly the most influential on the many recent films concerning robots.  Many Hollywood science fiction films have been based on Asimov's three laws and find it helpful to quote them. Other films refer to another of Asimov's inventions, the positronic brain. Bicentennial Man directly quoted the Three Laws of Robotics and Star Trek's android robot, DATA, was often said to have a positronic brain.<br /><br />The Three Laws of Robotics hold up very well with time and appear to be an inescapably logical way to define the important features of behavior in civilian robots. The laws, which are quoted numerous times in the film, are:<br /><br />1) A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.<br />2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, so long as this does not conflict with the First Law.<br />3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not interfere with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />This is not the first film to predict that the outcome of the three laws will be a computer or robot revolution intended to dominate man. This is based on the idea that man needs to be protected from his own warlike nature.  COLLOSUS, The Forbin Project made a very similar prediction, and the concept of a robot police state was also visited in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, though not attributed to the three laws. 2001 and 2010 made a similar projection but for entirely different reasons. Since the days of Frankenstein and probably before that a constant theme of sci-fi and horror is the artificially created turning on their creator.<br /><br />I believe that Asimov would defend his laws of robotics as being effective in assuring safety, while granting this film the artistic license to use this speculation. I also think that the idea of a robot being able to rebel in violation of the specific wording of the first law is more far fetched than a sentient robot itself.<br /><br />It is sad that we have not witnessed more humanoid robotic developments in the United States, the country of Asimov's fictional US ROBOTS AND MECHANICAL MEN.  It is HONDA's ASIMO which appears to be the most highly developed commercial robot. Because of the fear and suspicion that people might harbor against robots, HONDA chose to build their latest version of humanoid robot child sized. The big lumbering HONDA robots preceding it were a bit too intimidating and \\"Gort\\" like.  HONDA is to be congratulated for their pioneering work and will probably see some return on their investment when variations of ASIMO are actually used in science fiction films, as museum guides, and as a general purpose domestic robot initially used to assist disabled or elderly people and ultimately perform all forms of household work. Although not yet fulley autonomous,  ASIMO can currently walk and run on two legs, climb up and down stairs, play a decent game of soccer, recognize people and objects, speak, hear, recognize voices and react to speech appropriately. I would speculate that full autonomy for ASIMO will come within the next 15 years at most, only being limited by the number of calculations per second performed by the  supporting computer hardware and software. For more info about ASIMO search the web using GOOGLE.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder how much public interest there would be in sending another robot to Mars if the next lander were based on an ASIMO type design?  People might relate to seeing a bipedal humanoid robot walking on the surface of Mars, testing mineral samples for signs of water while occasionally looking into the camera and waving. Needless to say, NASA public relations would benefit immensely.<br /><br />The three laws of robotics could not be employed without modification in any military robot which might be under development in some secret government lab which would need to destroy human life in the course of assigned duties. Of course, I wouldn't care to imagine what we may have developed for the military, and just how fantastic such robot technology might be once permitted to trickle down to the circles of commerce. At that time it would be necessary to represent something with the effect of Asimov's three laws in these advanced machines.<br /><br />In the mid 70's (circa 1975) Isaac Asimov made an appearance at New York University, where my wife was attending graduate school.

B000VKDNB2|4.0|It provokes my thought to see how a scientist puts God on the same platform as any other human quest to find out about the world that we live in. Really, is there a reason that there should be any question that we should not ask? Other than not wanting to hurt the feeling of our fellow human beings...
B00009MGGI|4.0|As someone who was mesmerized by this trilogy when it appeared on Masterpiece Theater, I was surprised that the DVD was needlessly made into an \\"R\\" rated version.  Frontal nudity (women), back nudity (men) and simulated sexual intercourse on the DVD version in no way enhanced the triology.  I found myself embarrassed for the superb actor, Sir Ian Richardson, having to simulate explicit sex with actresses the age of his grandchildren.  Do directors really think the audience cannot imagine sexual affairs without having to see simulated intercourse or simulated oral sex between the actors in the movie?  To me it's bait and switch--you view a production on T.V. and are not told that what you are buying on DVD is not the same but has added content which you had not wished to see. Without the nudity and simulated sex I would have rated the trilogy *****.

It's a scary movie, true. And the effects and design of the film are breathtaking.  But this is an awful, awful movie. The plot is rediculous and frequently predictable. There are parts of the movie that I found absolutely sickening, and I have a strong stomach for gore. The ending is terrible, and also predictable.   It's a mean-spirited, badly acted, predictable, poorly written, disgusting piece of garbage movie.   But it is a scary horror movie.   Hope I hammered my points home. Avoid this piece of dreck.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|This is not the Metal Opera.  Sammet says it himself in very clear terms in the booklet: \\"But this time I have tried to do things a bit differently: I wanted to come up with something that was more abstract and not your typical good-vs-evil fantasy stuff.\\"  I loved the Metal Opera.  Both parts of it.  For a guy who \\"can't even read scores,\\" he did a pretty damn good job setting it up.  However, I quite agree with Sammet when he says \\"I didn't want to keep it within the limitations of a once-upon-a-time fairy tale, and I didn't want to squeeze the story into the tight corset of pedantry.\\"  Despite the love I have for Chalices of Agony and evil power-hungry Popes and Vandroiys, I believe that the Scarecrow is the best step that Tobias Sammet could have taken for Avantasia after his two-part-clichéd-epic.      Most people who fell in love with the Metal Opera will be looking for a plot early on.  Unfortunately for those who like overused fantasy cheese and fortunately for the rest of us, the \\"story\\" is nothing clear-cut or all that easy to define.  Rather than Gabriel Laymann attempting to save his stepsister Anna Held, we are treated to \\"something metaphoric,\\" as Sammet says, something that \\"wouldn't unveil and ruin the mystery of the story.\\"  As his \\"personal Faust-story,\\" he is careful to keep a blend of fact and fiction and personal experience that is impossible to determine and differentiate.  I like it; there is a lot of meaning to find in his strong lyrics.    The sounds in the Scarecrow are a good deal more varied when compared to the Metal Opera, which was quite strictly similar-sounding power metal (with the exception of the well-placed symphonic interludes).  Mix the eastern-sounding intro to \\"The Scarecrow\\" to the unsettling Alice Cooper vocals in \\"The Toy Master\\" to the bombastic energy of the chorus of \\"Another Angel Down\\" and the variety is clear.  It is quite welcome as well, especially after the Metal Opera's consistent high-pitched fantasy creaturesand over-the-top epic choruses.  Overall, it's a much shorter album with different aims.   If this isn't clear after the first listen, the depth of the Scarecrow is not for you.      The \\"romantic edge\\" of Sammet is more than present on this album.  His \\"romantic edge\\" isn't your soft, ballad-rich valley of crooning vocals and passion-dripping lyrics (though he fits a couple in), but powerful and edgy (or edguy, see what I did there?).  He brings up an antecedentless \\"She\\" more than a few times over four or so songs and as only \\"What Kind of Love\\" and \\"Cry a Little\\" could be given the power ballad label, the remainder is a mixed bag of anger, denial, and at times, radio-friendly alternative metal.  It's something you'll have to listen to in order to understand, but to be certain, it is an essential part of Sammet's elusive story.    Yes, if Sammet was trying to step into the mainstream, he would certainly do it with this album.  \\"Carry Me Over\\" and \\"Lost in Space\\" would fare decently on the radio.  His inner Hans Zimmer breaks out in \\"What Kind of Love.\\"  The mild chaotic insanities in the Metal Opera that were songs like \\"Reach Out For the Light\\" and \\"Sign of the Cross\\" are never attained again in this album, and considering the break from the Metal Opera, this is a good thing.  The highest energy song would be easily \\"Another Angel Down,\\" which, along with a few others, doesn't even try to reach for the stratosphere like in The Metal Opera.    As usual, the guest line-up is as exquisite as Sammet's own talent.  Jorn Lande and Roy Khan are especially good paired up with Sammet in my opinion, and Alice Cooper essentially makes \\"The Toy Master.\\"  I only wish that Amanda Somerville had been given a bit more spin time, as she gives a strong performance on \\"What Kind of Love\\" but is only heard in backing vocals in the rest of the album and I believe that with Sammet's themes of love and rejection, more of the female vocal touch might be appropriate.    The Scarecrow isa great step away from the overblown Metal Opera that, while great, did indeed impose a few limitations on Sammet's clear musical and compositional talents.  A simple but incredibly vague plot along with a mixed bag of somewhat unfocused sounds of music make this album what it is.  It is a strong album and though it does somewhat bear the mark of the dreaded sophomore release, it is definitely a keeper and though it may dispossess many members of the Avantasia following, it will certainly open up a new audience for Sammet's next endeavor (which will hopefully be sooner than three years, but no rushing though).    9/10

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|When I first heard Rihanna's hit \\"Umbrella\\" Ella, Ella  A A A.  I thought........ here we go again, another (one hit wonder) with a catchy pop tune for the MTV Crowd.  But a few months later she released another up-tempo dance tune \\"Don't Stop The Music\\" And I couldn't ignore her talent anymore. With \\"Don't stop the Music\\" she samples the unforgettable \\"Ma Ma Se, Ma Ma Sa, Ma Ma Coo Sa Ma Ma Se, Ma Ma Sa, Ma Ma Coo Sa\\" from Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Starting Some Thing\\". The is a tune I am jamming to right now, titled \\"SOS\\" from A `Girl Like Me\\"    I finally bought the album at Amazon. com digital download and made a copy for myself and my boy friend. We listen to it almost everyday. We are not spammer's we are poor making minimal wage. So this is a real review.    Keep it coming Rihanna. We love your music and your videos and your talent.

0385338724|3.0|Remember Me? by Sophie Kinsella is a fun romp of a novel featuring seemingly power-hungry, \\"bitch-boss-from-hell\\" Lexi Smart after she comes to after a car accident and discovers that she has absolutely no memory of the last three years of her life.         The last memory Lexi possesses is of her leaving a bar with her three best friends where she was trying to forget about her \\"crap job\\", her \\"crap boyfriend\\" (aptly nicknamed, \\"Loser Dave\\"), her frizzy hair and her teeth which have garnered her the nickname \\"snaggletooth\\". When she wakes up in the hospital, Lexi has discovered that she has a posh pad, a gorgeous and wealthy husband, perfect teeth and shiny glossy hair. Unfortunately, she also realizes that she no longer has her friends, any fun, or anything else that made Lexi herself.         In trying to discover how she went from \\"snaggletooth\\" to \\"bitch-boss-from-hell\\" Lexi discovers her true identity and puts her life back to rights.         Remember Me? is a novel about self-discovery, priorities, and learning to be true to oneself. It is fun, lighthearted and immensely entertaining. It is the perfect \\"comfort food\\" book when a girl is feeling down.
0679745653|3.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's by Truman Capote ***<br /><br />Breakfast At Tiffany's is an American literary classic, which spawned not only a hit movie, but a horrible number one hit song as well in the early 1990's. Tiffany's is a story of love, a story of loss, and a story of finding yourself, as well as staying true to yourself. We follow a man who is in love with the woman would is ultimately his best friend, though he does not realize that he is in fact in love with her until almost the end of the story, though to the reader it will become quite clear almost instantly, as the main character seems to be completely obsessed and infatuated with this women, but will not admit this to his self. That is basically the jest of the story. The girl can not find a place where she is happy living, and really is only happy in Tiffany's department store, where she believes that no one and nothing bad can happen to you there. Along the way criminals and drug charges are thrown in, but these just delay her search for happiness which she will not compromise for anyone.<br /><br />In the end the plot seems to run thin and is in my opinion very, very long winded. Even for such a short story as this is I feel it could have been shorter. Capotes writing style is fantastic and it is clear why he went on to become such a legend, but honestly I do not understand the hype behind Breakfast At Tiffany's, I think Capote had plenty of better material.
B000YY6786|5.0|i own the cd and listen to it twice. if you want to hear every detail of the instruments this is the one to get. but i still could'nt understand mick jagger singing in certain songs as i thought i would from this new shm cd format. if those of you that have the regular cd. your really not missing much with this one. its the same dsd remastering. but with a new plastic cover for the laser to pick more detail in the music than a regular cd.

B000F39M9W|5.0|First of all: there is no great difference between the versions of Rite of spring. Different from Petrushka and Firebird , the author correct few things, but I am convinced that no one can feel the difference.And the version recorded here is one of the bests I heard. But the principal thing in this recording is the Mussorgsky . Very good indeed . Is best than Abbado I and II ( that I love) and Dohnanyi ( the same). When people will forget the criminal version of Korsakow ???? I realy prefer the Bartok complete , but this is the best recording I heard of the Suite. Bravo Mr. Salonen !!! Bravo L A Philharmonic.
B00005JMK0|5.0|If you are a hopeless (or hopeful) romantic, then \\"Electric Dreams\\" is the perfect movie for you.  It's a quirky, off-beat, love story -- a Cyrano de Bergerac of the early personal computer age.    It is surprising that this movie still has not been put on DVD considering that Virginia Madsen has gone on to be an Oscar-nominated actress.
B000JLSM00|5.0|I just got my 1080p HDTV and Blu-ray player, and one of my first Blu-ray disc purchases was \\"The Searchers.\\"  All I can say is WOW! The picture looks stunning, especially all the shots in Monument Valley, with crystal clear detail.<br /><br />I had seen \\"The Searchers\\" many years ago, but it's a film you really have to see more than once to really appreciate. It's definitely not your typical 1950s western. What's striking about it is the level of implied violence that you don't seen in films even today. Perhaps the violence is so shocking just because the viewer doesn't see it on the screen. We do see the characters' reactions to it though. My thought was that if The Duke can't handle seeing it, then I don't want to either.<br /><br />There's a lot of different layers to \\"The Searchers,\\" a lot of things going on in the subtext. There's the unspoken yearning between Ethan and Martha, questions about where Ethan went after the war, Ethan's racism and views on religion, etc.  And for someone who supposedly wasn't a good actor, John Wayne gives a superb performance (he was always underrated as an actor). The look on his face when he saw his brother's farm burning was just heartbreaking. I wound up watching the movie three times, partly to marvel at the stunning 1080p picture, but also to catch little things that I missed on earlier viewings.
0452289963|4.0|The contents of this book are phenomenal.  From the very beginning you feel like the book was written for you. I have recommended it to everyone I know.

0375842209|4.0|THE BOOK THIEF is the story of a young girl, Liesel Meminger, who is sent to a foster family in pre-Nazi Germany. On the way to her new family, her brother dies, giving the reader their first glimpse of what is ahead for Liesel.<br /><br />Mr. Zusak uses a very unique approach to his story-telling. Told from an omniscient, narrative point of view, Death tells the story. I found myself looking forward to Death's humorous interjections, especially when he tells the reader that he doesn't wear a long, black cape and hood unless he's cold. How can a character like that be scary?<br /><br />The characters and setting are well drawn and easy to visualize. I can see why it has received such acclaim. However, to be honest, I wish I had not read this book. It is very depressing. We are told what happens from the time the tragedies occur until the end of the book, yet it seemed a bit abrupt. I felt like I had been smashed in the face and given a tissue for first aid.<br /><br />Overall, nice story, but not for me.<br /><br />CarolASpradling.com  author
B00004SVIK|5.0|I you are a fan of Pink Floyd and/or \\"The Wall\\", then you will love this CD!  It is really interesting to hear The Wall played live in its entirety.  It's an incredible record to begin with, but the live version adds another element to it.  I wish I had been there to see it!  Get the deluxe version for the book that comes with it.  The book tells the story of \\"The Wall\\" from each band member's perspective.  Great buy!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I'm frankly amazed that so many people have panned this movie. I mean, come on - it's not bloody \\"Armageddon\\"! Now THAT is a bad movie deserving all that is heaped upon it. The recent products of psychological tech-noir seem to leave a lot of people confused. Sci-fi fans hate it because it gets too ivory-tower and philosophical (I just want to see s**t explode, y'know?) and those looking for an excellent drama dismiss them because they LOOK like sci-fi.    Anyways, I put this movie in the same category as Soderbergh's remake of \\"Solaris\\" and Ron Moore's \\"Battlestar Galactica\\". This is a movie about what happens to human beings under severe stress, when they have nothing left to lose, and - from an individualist viewpoint - nothing left to live for. What choices do they make? What's at the core of all of us when the chips are not only down, but spent completely? Many fans here of Danny Boyle's other films see this as a pointless misadventure, and yet all of his films address this same basic concept. What connects us, and what are those connections worth?    The fact that this is a beautiful sci-fi movie that borrows on all the best tropes of the last 40 years seems to be a footnote. Much like \\"The Fountain\\", this movie balances the anguish and sacrifice of its cast with the astonishing beauty of an environment the human mind really can't even begin to grasp. It is awesome and transcendent, something I think Boyle did an excellent job representing with his rather mystical take on what coming so close to the sun would do to a human being.    \\"...and the people always fear what they don't understand.\\"

B000MRA5NS|5.0|If you watch Bond films for adolescent immaturity along the lines of such horrible films in the series as Moonraker, or for overly bosomed women playing horrid roles (a la Denise Richards in T.W.I.N.E) - then this is not the Bond for you.  In his nearly 40 year history, he had become more of a cartoon than a man, and a lot of people loved him for it.  That kind of escapism was done best by Bond - but for many (myself included) that diluted the character and the entire franchise into nothing but childish banter and one-dimensional plots.    Then came Casino Royale - a movie that has successfully breathed new life into James Bond.  This film is not a continuation, part of the previous series of films, or an homage - this is a new Bond and a reboot back to the original Ian Fleming tales.  Here we see him taking on the role for the first time (hence, why there is no Q, why he is not as brash with women, why he makes mistakes, and why (thank God!) we get to see him vulnerable as a human being), and Daniel Craig brings depth and persona back to the character that had been missing since Thunderball.      This is a movie for filmgoers who like their action with a dash of realism, and their characters to have three dimensions.  This movie does not insult the intelligence of its audience and does not pull any punches.  An intense thriller that will hopefully bring longevity back to the character in an age where Bourne rules.    Don't be misled into thinking there are no gadgets here - there are several and they play heavily into 007's survival.  Don't think there is a lack of beautiful women (just no damsels in distress or unrealistic fawning), just don't be surprised to see James actually care - since he doesn't yet know that he must be guarded in order to survive.  And there's definitely no lacking in other Bond staples (one-liners, brilliant foes, chases and action set pieces).  A lot of people don't realize that there was intentionally no Q (although it's very likely we'll see that branch soon enough in Quantum or just after), because this Bond is feeling the ropes for the first time (and has gone rogue, so it wouldn't make sense for MI6 to give a rogue agent any of their expensive toys).  No Moneypenny also makes sense - as we never see him at the office since is mission is clearly unofficial.    It's a brilliant stand-alone film and a welcome change of pace to a tired franchise.  Welcome back, James.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I am usually not too impressed with Director Cut DVD's.  I was very impressed with this.  THe extra scenes really added flavor and depth to this already great story.  I could see why a couple of cuts were made towards the end of the film... it could have spoiled it for first time viewers.  Add this one to your collection ASAP!
B0010X8NF0|2.0|I deliberately held off for as long as I could with this one. However, a new Wes Anderson film does have its attraction. He does have that particular niche for making films that look and feel foreign. Though I wouldn't neccesarily call myself a fan. The only accomplished film I believe Anderson has made thus far is 'Rushmore'. I was 14 years old and a Freshman in high school when it opened in theaters. I loved it, and I still love it. It holds up pretty well even by today's standards. Dare I call it a classic? Perhaps.     Still, that was 10 years ago and since then, Anderson has dished out 3 films, all creative and quirky. Yet, none have been able to match 'Rushmore's' fresh wit and involving characters. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' was ice cold and distant. 'The Life Aquatic' was . . . well, you can read my review on that.    Suprisingly, 'The Darjeeling Limited' turns out to be his best film since 'Rushmore'. You can tell that it comes from a personal place and you can really get a feel for at least one of the main characters. Adrien Brody, in my opinion, was the better of the three. His entire persona from his physical attributes to his emotional attributes were the most developed. Either that or he's simply just a better actor than Schwartzman and Wilson-probably both. The film definitely has a sort of charm to it. The exotic setting doesn't hurt either.     The problem with 'The Darjeeling Limited' is similar to the problems in 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'The Life Aquatic'. It's just too self-concience of itself. Anderson, along with his co-writers, somtimes make dialogue and scenes so intentionaly off-kilter that it becomes difficult for the audience to feel a real connection with the characters. If 'The Darjeeling Limited' were a person, it would be a too-proud, artisticly talented, loner who pushes people away. Lets just say the person would have some definite issues to work out much like how this film does.    Now, I'm probably going to get attacked-it seems I always do when it comes to criticizing Wes Anderson. I know a lot of people revere him and his films as genius. Perhaps it's becuase the Criterion Collection seems to think so. So I will only say this: There are a lot of writers who are better directors and there are directors who are better writers. It's a rarity that you find both. I feel that Wes Anderson is a better director than he is a writer. Interestingly enough, it seems that Anderson is simply unable to write a film by himself. He hasn't yet and probably never will, and that could be our loss. We know his directing style so well but the voice of his films (after 'Rushmore') are weak and need some strengthening muscle to better them.     'The Darjeeling Limited' is definitely a nice rebound from 'The Life Aquatic'. He's on the right track. I have faith in him that he'll come out with a film that will really blow all of us away. Until then, I'll wait patiently.   **1/2

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Let me start by saying this review will be completely biased!  As a lover of Springsteen since seeing him with the E Street Band for the first time as a teen it would be pretty hard for him to release something that I did not like.    That being said, Magic is like the Springsteen of the seventees.  If not for the age and time we live in now and the furor over his political views by those who control mainstream radio, this CD would have several smash hits, including the relentless \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" and the equally smooth \\"Girls in Summer Clothes.\\"    The wall of sound is back in play on this disc, much more so than on \\"The Rising.\\"  This sounds like a garage band having fun jamming on a summer evening.

0743298039|5.0|This is an amazing book. \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" isn't a mystery, horror, a romance; it's beyond genre. Setterfield combines a richness of detail and a precision of language that echo classic 19th century literature without seeming affected or derivative. \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" isn't an imitation of Charlotte Bronte, but there are ghosts and governesses and dangerous lunatics, along with a well-sustained mystery so intricate that you can't possibly guess the ending before you read it. Setterfield acknowledges her literary inspirations (\\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" appear several times in the narrative), but what she's written is a contemporary story framing a classic gothic tale. It's a book about reading, about why we create stories and why we crave them, about all of the ways in which words can both illuminate and obscure meaning (and, surely not coincidentally, it's also a book about women). \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a feast for those of us who devour books. I couldn't put it down.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|New review edit on 7/28/08...<br /><br />John Adams should be shown in every history class in America. I know that when I was much younger (and could care less about history) I was shown films like Glory at school, and it made me appreciate the subject of The Civil War much more than just reading about it. This miniseries made me proud of living in this country many times over. Okay, things aren't the best for us as a nation right now, but this series gave me hope. If leadership like this happened before, it surely can again.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti was outstanding as John Adams. He really knows how to deliver his lines, especially the speeches. Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin, David Morse as George Washington and Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, really blew me away. They all deserve the Emmy nominations they have received.<br /><br />The only reason I took off a star is that it did drag a little at times, but even at its length, I wouldn't have minded some extra Revolutionary War footage.<br /><br />This would be a great gift for a history buff or any American that wants to feel proud.

0451529065|5.0|With all of the \\"Intelligent Design/Evolution\\" books being published these days, I though I'd read the book that started it all. OK, I didn't actually read it; I listened to an abridged audio version, with Richard Dawkins narrating. (You can download that on iTunes, or buy it at amazon.co.uk.) Darwin's thesis was simple, that species are engaged in a struggle for existence, and that the ones with the features best adapted to the environment will survive. Thus, by a slow process of natural selection, species acquire different traits. Darwin made an analogy with domestic animal and plant breeding, and how different varieties of species come about as a result. He concluded that the distinction between species and varieties was largely arbitrary, and from that extrapolated his theory of natural selection. The way different species in a particular area are related though distinct, Darwin concludes, cannot be explained by a theory of independent creation. It's amazing how Darwin was able to figure all of this out even before our new evidence of embryology, DNA, plate tectonics, etc. have confirmed his theory. Further, Darwin anticipated the \\"fossil gap\\" and \\"irreducible complexity of the eye\\" objections still in circulation among creationists and IDers. Of course, the fossil record and the knowledge of eye development has only gotten richer since Darwin. Everyone should read this, and see for themselves how Darwin's idea is simple, yet powerful in explaining the world around us.
B000025RX4|5.0|My favorite studio album from Johnny Winter. The songs and performance is amazing. Although not as \\"raw\\" and \\"blaring\\" as his other albums, I actually like the melancholic and polished feel of this record. Great production work on the sound. I first heard it as a 16 year old and 35 years later, I still love it so much today. For the \\"live\\" album you must get \\"Johnny Winter And Live\\" its awesome too. I believe there is a combined set being sold. A must have for all fans. Absolutely 2 thumbs up!! Does anyone know where I can get the sheet music for this album?

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|This has been the least impressive BRD acquisition for myself, so far.  By no fault of the movie itself though.  Wicked movie.  Snyder is great, and I'm looking forward to Watchmen.  But this disc... I had terrible strobing / white dots popping in the image.  This was in the background / areas of high grain / and areas with subtle gradients.  This is a problem some people seem to have and not have.  I guess I got unlucky with this disc.   I have seen this image distortion on the Planet Earth BRD, but only for a few shots.  For 300, this was happening throughout the whole film, making it almost unbearable to watch.  I'm assuming it's a manufacturing issue.  A damn shame too, considering the work that goes into a movie like this.

076781214X|4.0|Ok, let me start off by saying that I definately feel that Peggy Sue Got Married is your classic \\"chick flick\\". It has all the elements that women love, and men can't understand.     Peggy Sue is divorced from her high school sweetheart Charlie, and is very unhappy, but finds herself going with her daughter to her high school reunion anyways. She faints and when she wakes up she is back in high school in 1960!     She keeps trying to break up with Charlie, since she knows how their future ends up; but Charlie refuses (how romantic).    All in all she remembers why it was that she loved Charlie, and realizes that no matter what they are destined to be together. When she returns to the present Charlie is there and apologizes for everything they have been through and wants to try to work things out.     This is one of the best endings to a movie. Her going back in time didn't change anything, but made her realize that she and Charlie belong together. It doesn't erase everything they have gone through, but when she wakes up she is ready to try again, as is Charlie. It didn't magically erase their life and trials and create some fake happy-go-lucky, corny ending... but gave a (somewhat..) realistic ending.    An excellent, excellent movie!!
0753453800|5.0|The book has nice pen and ink illustrations throughout and includes the original Treasure Island map illustration from the original edition. The cover art is by a different artist who has clearly adapted the image from the very familiar publicity photo of Jim and Long John Silver from the Disney film--kind of humorous.
B000002KKK|5.0|ZZ Top be cool, man! And sho nuff BAD! They also know how to play the blues, and boogie with the best! They do it all right here on Deguello (1979). The album has one foot in the blues and boogie of their 1970s sound, and the other foot in the cool, bluesy working class chic of their 1980s sound.<br /><br />It opens with a funky, slide guitar laden cover of Sam And Dave's I Thank You. Like just about everything else Billy Gibbons does, this is a little bit toungue-in-cheek, but it's a cool sound and great start to the album. The swaggering strut of I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide connected with ZZ fans in a big way, and Low Rider ain't got nuthin' on this baby!<br /><br />Easin' down the highway in a new Cadillac<br />I had a fine fox in front, I had three more in the back<br />They sportin' short dresses, wearing spike-heel shoes<br />Smokin' Lucky Strikes and wearing nylons, too<br />Cause we bad, we nationwide<br />Yeah, we bad<br />...We Nationwide<br /><br />Fool For Your Stockings is ZZ Top's best slow blues, and the smokin' guitar licks make the song a classic. The wry and sexy lyrics are great, too. Their cover of Robert Johnson's Dust My Broom works just fine, and the twisted Manic Mechanic and She Loves My Automobile are a lot of fun, too. The bluesy and sly Cheap Sunglasses is deservedly one of ZZ Top's most famous and popular songs. It's in the same low-rent neighborhood as I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide, only this time it's the morning after with hangover-induced paranoia.<br /><br />Now go out and get yourself some big black frames<br />With the glass so dark they won't even know your name<br /><br />Deguello is one of ZZ Top's very best albums, and it's definitely their coolest and baddest one. It's essential for any ZZ Top collection, so go out and get this one, and don't forget those cheap sunglasses!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love this show.  It's a great mix of a good storey-line, humour and SCARES!
B0001FGBD4|5.0|excellent sound, great for showing off sacd capabilities. seriously recommend it. I'm not a jazz listener, but this sacd is worth listening to.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|I see by other reviews that this is either a five-star film, or a one-star film. You either love it or hate it. I suppose I fall in the two-star category, as there were moments of brilliance mixed with just a few more \\"Star Trek\\" moments. Let me explain....  \\"Technobabble\\" is fine for some Sci-fi films. Sometimes, it makes them better films than they would have been without it. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those. The entire premise of \\"restarting\\" the Sun is fraught with insurmountable problems from the start! There is NOTHING on Earth that could possibly be used to accomplish the task. NOTHING.   The ship used to carry our intrepid spacesters to the Sun is made out of what? It must be some heavy-duty stuff, as it doesn't liquify as it gets closer to the Sun.   \\"Slingshot\\" around Mercury? WHHAAATT?! Folks, there isn't enough gravitational energy in Mercury to do this (in essence, the mission is a \\"one-way\\" or suicide mission, which is what it became, anyway). Another reviewer stated that the crew was apathetic toward the mission, and I would have to agree. Was there a psychological reason to send people with the most susceptible profile predisposed to suicide or murder?   What about the \\"Crispy Critter\\" guy near the end? Someone burned over 100% of their body is a goner. Ask any Burn Specialist. They would tell you that the person would not survive long enough to see the burns heal.   There were high points, too....I loved the white-yellow-orange hue of the film. The Oxygen Garden was pretty, as well as functional. The scenes of the Sun were fantastic, as looking at the real thing would do only one thing for you.  There WAS one thing I was expecting to see that wasn't in the film....one of the crew in space shorts dangling his (or her) legs over the heat shielding, roasting marshmallows!   The film gets only two stars because it's high points just could not overcome it's lows. If this film were made with some (alot) technobabble to explain away it's most glaringfaults, I probably would have given it a four-star rating.    There are some cool special features on the DVD. Two short films with an intro by the director, deleted scenes (which would not have helped the film, even if they were included), and an alternate ending. DVD transfer was good.   Danny Boyle's best has already been seen (28 Days Later). I'm still hoping for another one like it, because this one ain't it!
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  With a talented cast consisting of Gene Kelley, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor you can't go wrong.  There are so many unforgettable scenes in this movie that no one could ever touch.  Gene Kelley singing and dancing his way thru the neighborhood to Singin in the Rain, and all three companionably working their magic to Good Mornin.
0307237702|5.0|Great audiobook! I really enjoyed it. Great motivator and a wonderful speaker. Very inspirational. There's nothing negative in his writings. Only inspiration and hope. Hope for all people. I'm very selective when it comes to what I feed my brain and my children. There's no negative and/or hate messages in his writings. I don't know what else to say. Just read and judge for yourself. I'm not a tabloid or front page reader. You might say I'm from the show me state. I had to do the research to find out the truth. I respect, but I can't agree with the review I just read. That's why I got the books and did the research. Man is imperfect....it's God I worship. I'm first and far most a member of the Democratic Party. That's where my focus is. This is a very important time in our lives and no matter who gets to run in November on the Democratic ticket, I will support them. Out with the present damaged government and let's work together towards a new one that's cares about it's people. Be careful, if you're a Democrat, not to make statements that may damage the party due to the \\"favorite game\\". This is not a game. This is the real world. As I said, I enjoyed Mr. Obama's audiobooks. They were very well written and spoken and a great feeling and inspiration for all ages. Take away the politics, the faces, the spin and listen to the message without your prejudices (we all have them)and judge for yourself. I did. Thank for reading my review. I think both Hilliary and Obama could both make a difference, but I have to say Mr. Obama can inspire the people. According to the latest polls people feel he can be trusted to do a good job if chosen. No matter who's choosen it's our jobs as citizens of the USA to keep tabs, checks and balances to make sure our nation is healthy with a functional government that's for the people. It's \\"WE THE PEOPLE\\"...we are the only ones that can make a difference, reclaim our government and heal the nation. It's not up to Mr. Obama to fix us. He can't. We have to fix ourselves. He seems to have the ability to unite and open up mutual channels of communication that's needed to move forward. With the ability for all to cooperated and communicate for the greater good we can accomplish great things.  ps. Dreams of the father:and the audicity of hope are also great!
6305127646|4.0|I did see the original series, but still really liked this movie.  Val Kilmer made a great Simon Templar!  I thought his multiple personalities embodied in his disguises were well done.  The accents, languages, and mannerisms were also what were expected of him.  There was a nice balance of romance and suspense, which is what made this highly enjoyable.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I read a sampling of the 5-star reviews and a sampling of the 1-star reviews. My own review of Jeepers Creepers comes much closer to the 5-star reviews.  Like many others, I also think the 1-star reviewers failed to grasp the real horror of this film.  It's not about a scary monster so much as it is about a morbidly scared kid who in no way, shape or form deserves his fate - even though he inadvertently brings about that very fate.  The 1-star reviewers all wondered why Derry and his sister don't just keep on driving till they're safely away - and they might have been able to if Derry hadn't been unwilling to simply turn his back on the body thrown down the well. But once they gave up that one and only chance to get away, they will never be safely away from this creature who has fixed on Derry as his next victim.  This isn't your typical grab someone, anyone, and chow down monster.  This is a monster who chooses his next meal very carefully, following a very rigid protocol.  This is truly a serial-killer monster.  Okay, he flies; okay, he drives a truck that looks more like a Sherman tank.  Granted, that's a bit over the top: your typical monster wouldn't drive and fly.  He also leaps in a single bound.  And I have to admit the whole Jeepers Creepers bit falls flat; it's like the director wanted to work that song in somehow - but forgot to give some idea how the monster got addicted to it.  Most of all, the 1-star reviewers are 180 degrees off about the acting.  The acting is absolutely perfect for the movie; and Justin Long's Derry is as well-acted as anyone you're going to find in this genre.  Before the movie's half over, you know Derry like a book, inside and out - and there is more to him than just being scared out of his mind.  That happens to be good, not bad, acting.  And you genuinely care about him and what happens to him - because you come to realize that, of all the people on the planet, he's the least prepared to cope with something like this.  That counts for a lot in a movie.<br />By far the most disturbing aspect of this movie - and I'm tempted to think the real reason a lot of people hated it - is that the bad guy wins.  Even for a horror movie devotee like me that's quite a jolt.  You just come to expect - especially in this genre - that good will always triumph over evil.  But this time it doesn't.  And no matter how many times you watch the movie, the ending still get to you.
6305657947|5.0|A movie that is better than the original.  Thomas Crown is a very complex character played well by Pierce Brosnan!  Rene Russo is perfectly cast as his counterpart Catherine Banning.  Pierce and Rene literally sizzle on screen, and I don't think anyone could have done this better.
B00133KFGW|5.0|And the language is music. Beautiful music. A seamless combination of classical and rock-n-roll music lies behind the tale. It's the love story of two musicians as dreamed by a lost child, who discovers his musical gifts through everything and everyone around him. The lesson is about listening to your heart and staying true to your dream. There's no room for greed and disingenuous intentions. Mistakes can be forgiven and lessons learned.<br /><br />Every actor in this film is as lovely as the fanciful story, and love oozes from every note. I've watched it twice and both times, my heart was filled with joy. August Rush is one for the ages and excellent viewing for the entire family. My highest recommendation.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I went into this series begging to love it.  I have been a fan of Doctor Who for over 20 years and love the new version.  I absolutely loved Captain Jack in the Doctor Who series, so I was so excited when Torchwood was released.<br /><br />Then came episode 1.  I thought it was a joke.  Then, I just thought it would get better.  Then I assumed something was wrong with me.  However, I then watched the show with other Doctor Who fans.<br /><br />I fast came to the conclusion that this is the worst show I have ever seen.  Period.  Any genre.  At all.<br /><br />This is painful to say, but it is absolutely horrendous.  Terrible characters. [...]<br /><br />In ever single episode, all the characters completely ignore Jack and do the exact opposite of what he says.  Then, guess what?  Chaos ensues.  You would think after the first 20 times Gwen screwed up, she would listen.  However, she's an idiot.  So are the rest.  I was hoping to god Jack would show some of his stuff eventually.  NO.  He's god awful too.<br /><br />I honestly have pain writing this.  But listen to a fan.  Of Doctor Who, and all series Scifi.  My favorite show is BSG.  I love Firefly.  I enjoy Stargate (both series).  I can recommend Babylon 5, Farscape and Red Dwarf.  I hope to all scifi gods that this show does not see season 2.<br /><br />The characters are so terrible and unbelieveable.  They act as though they are ridiculously stupid.  How can a black ops outfit have 5 people!!!  And 5 amazingly stupid people at that!!!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I'm a serious fan of this show from day 1, and while I really hated the fact that the Sci-Fi Chan. saw fit to end the series, it looks like it will live on in DVD form for some time to come!  (They did plug \\"Stargate Continuum\\" coming Summer '08 on DVD, BTW.)    The plot did have a few potholes, but the thing that bugged me most was that \\"Cam\\" was given dialog with 2 obscenities, something that was never used while the show was on Showtime (and the early days there even featured some female nudity, I might add).    I find obscenities demean the characters AND the persons watching, so without this, I might have given the show a 5 star rating.    BTW, the prolog included gives you a LOT of history up to the point of the movie, so if you're watching season 10 via syndication (like I am), it will have a few spoilers in it.  -The prolog is nearly 9 mins. long, and starts from the moment Cam's introduced to the show.    Oddly, they didn't include any background for someone not familiar with the show, so it might leave some of you wondering a little.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|Wow, this movie really was disappointing to me. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks \\"The Omega Man\\" was a much superior movie but I call it like I see it. Just watch one, then the other , and you tell me. I thought this movie was choppy and rushed. You couldn't get a real sense of the character's situation like you did in Omega man. The vampire creatures were really not believable...how come when I have a virus I don't have the strength to run fast and tip over SUVs? Whats wrong with Hollywood? The Omega Man was believable to me. The characters were more believable and the story was too. This was just not even worth my time. Lame, Hollywood, lame!
B0014CDKVY|5.0|Will Smith makes this movie. Period. Anyone else and the film would have been a complete flop in my opinion. His abilities as an actor in this film deserve recognition. I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of the zombie film. Frankly Dawn of the Dead is one of the worst films I have unfortunately spent time watching. However, this film is by far more powerful and more emotionally developed than most. Yes, the point is suspense, but when you can attach yourself to a character the way you can in this movie, that is what really makes a film.
0375842209|1.0|I think there is a reason why this book is in the Young Adult section. Because it received great reviews, I thought that it would be one of those best sellers would be worth reading. It wasn't. Let's just say that not because something is easy to read, it means that it's necessarily good. Nothing impacted me, the language did not impress me and neither did the story. Nothing really happens in the book, I mean, I think there were like 3 main events and the rest is just kids being kids. And the whole, \\"I'm a little girl thirsty for more books\\" is just something I didn't buy. I shy away from best sellers because they usually lack quality, although there are exceptions like \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code\\". By the time I got halfway through, all I wanted was to finish it and end my suffering. Oh, and by the way, I'm a 29 yr. old woman using my boyfriend's account to write this review.
0375831002|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read.  I finished this book about 1 month ago and still get emotional when I think back on it.  It was beautifully written and I am buying the hardcover to keep and share with my 14 year old son
6305971935|3.0|This movie is supposedly based on a true story.  It's not the most believable movie I've ever seen but I still find it very enjoyable to watch nonetheless.
0765348276|5.0|I've been reading SF since I was 9, in 1971. \\"A wrinkle in time\\" I'm pretty sure.  It got me hooked, and I started reading. I haven't quit since.  Depending when you asked me I would give you different answers as to what my favorite book was; sometimes it would be Lord of the Rings, often it would be The Incomplete Enchanter, sometimes the Federation Trilogy, sometimes one of the Pern books. there were some books that didn't last long in this position, like no more than a week for \\"Gord the Rogue\\"(sorry Gary. You profoundly changed my life in other ways), maybe a couple of weeks for the first Xanth book, 3 weeks or so for Dune, Rendezvous with Rama, Gateway, every Niven or Bujold book as I read it, etc, etc.  But, over the years, if I hadn't had a chance to read much or I was busy with other things, you could ask me and I would say \\"Starship Troopers\\".  Heinlein has always been my favorite author; he won that slot right after reading Citizen of the Galaxy for the first time, and Starship Troopers just cemented it in place. To the best of my knowledge, I've read everything he ever wrote as fiction; over the years in the inevitable late-night discussions where this sort of thing comes up, I've pointed out that RAH wrote a definitive book in every genre.  Starship Troopers changed the way I thought about...everything. The book made complete and total sense to me, I could understand and relate to everything in it. When I joined the Navy, I have to say it was in large part due to Starship Troopers and RAH himself. In management situations over the years, I've used thoughts shaped by the book to help resolve many a crisis situation. Growing up in a all white small town, you can imagine the revelation that finding the hero of my favorite book wasn't \\"white\\" caused.  I've probably read the book in excess of 50 times over the last 30 years.  A few years ago, I read a review that Cory Doctorow wrote on Old Man's war, comparing it to Starship Troopers and Forever War; I filedit away as something I should pick up.  I came across it at a book store last week, remembered the review and grabbed it.  wow.  Robert Heinlein's writing were colored by his timeline; the concepts are in part dated, the morality is not modern, and there are various aspects of it that tell you that the book was written a long time ago.  If RAH had been born in 1969 and wrote Starship Troopers sometime around the year 2000, I think the book would have been very similar to Old Man's war, but probably not as funny. I really can't give any higher praise to a book, or to an author.  I have no problems saying that, in my opinion, it's the 2nd best example of Military SF ever written.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I have only seen this movie once. It been like early 1997, but that's only a good thing. Deep Impact came out the same time this movie did. Each movie recieved good reviews. Which movie would fair better for me?   It cannot really be a contest because Armegeddon was no where near good. My grandfather saw the movie with my father and I and even he thought it was terrible.    The movie starts off with a NASA Space Shuttle being attacked by little Flinstone size pebbles of a media, eventually getting bigger and destroying the shuttle. The plot is the same as Deep Impact. That is to destroy an asteriod to save Earth. If the space shuttle got taken out, I am surprised that the meteor didn't knock out the planet all at once. Deep Impact did not start offf with a Space Shuttle being destroyed. The scientists in that movie discovered by satellite that there was a big meteor storm coming; more reasonable than what hapened in Armegeddon.    What was worse about Armeggeddon is that it made fun of Earth's environment (in a way). There was this big huge muscular cowboy on board an oil tanker messing with his wrench. They had a golf tournament playing with a golf ball, hitting it from one oil tanker to the other in the middle of the ocean. Worse of all is when a bunch of hickey's got together to save the planet earth and some other disturbing scenes. I don't even want to talk anymore about the movie. It also discriminated against Deep Impact in a way and was not up to my expectations.     For anyone picking this up, be careful what you are watching. You will either love or or tatally dislike it. Garunteed! A majority of people loved this film, but a majority thought it was awful. I'm surprised if anybody loved such a terrible film.
B0000062S0|4.0|I was pretty fearful about first hearing this album, since I really hated most post-Zeppelin releases, but was excited to hear this as it was engineered by Steve Albini, a recordist who I had always wished was around to help make a Led Zep reunion album.  Albini is very adept at recreating a Zeppelin-like sound for the album, and it's no wonder he was chosen as engineer, despite his dark horse status -- the drums and guitars sound terrific, and there are many details of Robert Plant's voice that were not captured on his earlier solo efforts. Jimmy Page shows off a great arsenal of different guitar sounds, and while he plays no really blistering solos, the work bears his unmistakable signature, expertly recorded to boot. The mixes have almost 3-D depth, and when turned up loud they will kick you right in the guts.    The songs here must be applauded simply for not trying to make it sound like they are young again. These are middle-aged men, with a stock of tunes that tend to favor ballads (with loud bridges, of course); the lyrics often seem to reflect on loss and aging, rather than describing elves, fairies, and cavorting with Los Angeles groupies. They sound older, but all the wiser. On \\"Blue Train\\", there is obvious and very affecting sincerity in such lines as \\"love's true flame dies without the warmth of your sun,\\" -- something that would sound ridiculous coming from a younger band, but here Plant gives it an earnest quality that makes it totally believable.    It's not a perfect record. The single, \\"Most High\\", loses me after a few minutes, and the title track lacks focus even though it's based on a pretty good guitar riff. But \\"Shining In the Light\\" sounds very new and refreshing, as well \\"When the World Was Young,\\" which could have sounded quite at-home on an album like \\"Presence\\".    This album won't change your life, but more or less, it rocks. Sometimes, conviction is all you need, and there's plenty of it here.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|Plot line good, acting good, effects sucked very badly.  Everything was looking good until I saw the hairless rats that were so overly the top cgi generated it looked like a pixar movie.  Then it got worse from there, the villans were all cgi and you could tell they were all computer generated because nothing looked even remotely realistic about them.  I have concluded that WB studios are lazy and do not care a thing about how the audience feels.  When it boils down to WB movies I've noticed where they are relying too much on CGI and none of it looks real. I made the mistake of buying this movie, and am stuck with it and the loss of $20.00.  So in conclusion, if there is another movie that is horror that is produced by WB I will break down and get a blockbuster card and rent it before I blow my cash on a piece of junk like this again.
B000000H4V|5.0|Sepultura's 5th studio album really displays the band at their best. Sepultura started as amateurs, believe it or not, still learning how to play each of their instruments still while they were building their reputation as a great pioneering Death Metal band, one of the best out there in my opinion. 1993's \\"Chaos A.D.\\" is ther best album, followed by 1996's \\"Roots\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />  Highlights include \\"Refuse/Resist\\", \\"Territory\\", \\"Kaiowas\\" \\"Propoganda\\" \\"Biotech is Godzilla\\", \\"Nomad, \\"We who are not as others\\", \\"Manifest\\", and \\"The Hunt\\", although every song on here is pretty amazing in it's own way. With this version of the album, you also get 4 bonus tracks marked by a star on the back of the album to show which songs are bonuses and which are originals. \\"Chaos B.C.\\" is a good (remix) song, however it can get annoying after a few listens. It's the song \\"Refuse/ Resist\\" remixed with more of a techno-influenced sound, and every line of every verse remixed and repeated 4 times. The next one, \\"Kaiowas (Tribal Jam)\\" is a cool track (I actually like it better than the original \\"Kaiowas\\". It has very loud tribal drums (although it is still an acoustic, nonetheless. I didn't want the word LOUD tribal drums to throw you off). You can dance to it, it's catchy. \\"Territory (LIVE)\\" is the 2nd track of this album performed live. The studio version has some excellent drumwork, and the live version has outstanding drumwork (I like it better than the guitars and vocals). Amen/ Inner Self performed live are also some good tracks that definitely deserve a place on this album.<br /><br />  I only reviewed the bonus songs as  the original songs have already been thoroughly broken down and rated.<br /><br />  OVERALL: I hope I've been helpful and I would totally recommend any fan of Sepultura, Death Metal, Pioneering Death Metal, etc, etc. This is a great album, mastered and mixed to the highest standards possible (every track has been remastered, including the extra/bonus songs). This is worth the price completely! A MUST BUY! BUY THIS TODAY!!!<br /><br />  I also reccommend:<br /><br />  \\"Roots\\" by Sepultura<br /><br />  \\"Arise\\" by Sepultura<br /><br />  \\"Beneath the Remains\\" by Sepultura<br /><br />  \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" by Pantera<br /><br />  \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" by Pantera<br /><br />  \\"The Great Southern Trendkill\\" by Pantera<br /><br />  \\"Reinventing the Steel\\" by Pantera<br /><br />  \\"Kill Em All\\" by Metallica<br /><br />  \\"Ride the Lightning\\" by Metallica<br /><br />  \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallicaorth the price completely!

B000P2A256|5.0|Maroon 5 emerged on to the pop scene in the early 00's with their megahit \\"This Love.\\"  They made lots of fans with that song and who knew they would become so famous?  Well Maroon 5 didn't dissapoint their fans because their latest hit \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" went all the way to number one on the Billboard Hot 100!  It's a great song and shows the bands ability to mix pop with soul and funk.  The rest of this album is pretty good too.  I'd call it a solid effort from Adam Levine and company.  I'll always be a Maroon 5 fan whether it's listening to them in the car or in the club (yes, they played them in the club too!). \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is one of my all time favorites now too.  Their most recent hit \\"Wake Up Call\\" is also pretty good.  If you were thinking about purchasing this album DO IT!  You'll be surprised at how good this is!

817224164X|5.0|From my point of view this is probably one of the most important books written.  This is one of those books that changes history.  Yes, this means I completely disagree with what Hitler said about books.  He mentioned that books don't change history, but a good speaker/leader does.  While this is very true, books usually exist in conjunction with this.  I think you need both because the book is far more timeless than the speaker and often times a book precedes a major turning point for a movement.  Look at texts like \\"The Bible\\", \\"The Principia,\\" or Euclid's \\"The Thirteen Elements\\".  All these texts were turning points in history and changed the way we look at the world.  \\"Mein Kampf\\" would forever change the way we looked at the world as well.  It literally moved nations to act... in opposition of such a major power struggle.<br /><br />I do not advocate Hitler's methodology in what he did, but I do acknowledge the profound impact it has left on the world and the major advancements we were all forced to make in realms such as technology.  Now that this book is part of history you can't help but think of the \\"what if...\\" scenarios as I read through this massive text, I'll play into these concepts as I touch upon specific areas.  Now I'm not a World War II or World War I historian by any means, so it was a hard book for me to read some of the more minute details Hitler referenced in this book.  However, I read it more for the prospects in philosophy.<br /><br />This particular edition is split into two different volumes with an excellent introduction by the translator.  Volume I was printed in 1925 and then Volume II came out in the year 1926, so they were written very close together.  The first was mostly philosophical and recounts his childhood growing up.  The second was more a general history of the political party and how to deal with foreign nations.  It's interesting that Hitler didn't put out any other books after these two and I assume it's because his involvement in politics took up much more of his time and no longer had the free time to write.  However, they did find another book he was working on after the fall of the Reich and is now published as \\"Hitler's Second Book\\".  This edition is great because it compared the first printing with the second printing and footnotes the discrepancies.  It also adds in details on the people Hitler named specifically in this book who would be relatively unknown to the rest of the world outside Nazi Germany and especially helpful to me because I haven't read that much about this period in history to know the extreme details.  In Volume's I and II Hitler specifically references incidents in World War I that really helped shape the beliefs he has here.<br /><br />Anyway the introduction that prefaces this edition is rather lengthy, but well worth the read.  It adds more of the historical background into the text you are about to dig into.  It has interesting anecdotes about Hitler's involvement with the party, like in the text he states he was the seventh member of the DAP, but later it was found out he was 555th and this was corroborated with an unsent letter from Drexler, one of the founders.  In fact when historian's looked at the membership items that were left behind after the war they could see that Hitler's had been altered physically.  Also the introduction has an excellent overview of the printing of this book.  Such as how it is not allowed to be printed in certain countries.  Luckily in my country no such restrictions apply to any printed document, so I am free to read and review whatever I wish, regardless of how inaccurate a printed document is.  I'm definitely glad there was an introduction even though it added another twenty pages onto an already daunting read.  The introduction also forewarns us that Hitler can have a tendency to ramble in forms that eventually make little sense.  I'm glad this warning was stated because when reading this book it was quite clear whenHitler felt particularly passionate about the subject he started to go off on these ridiculous tangents and tirades, often times in run on sentence form.<br /><br />In the spirit of this book, I will review Volume I separately from Volume II.  So first we discuss Hitler's philosophy and growing up.  Personally, I think Hitler should have stuck with the philosophical approach and left politics to the politicians (regardless of the fact this didn't mesh with his philosophy).  Hitler's main point in doing the things he believed in was to change society for the better.  It's very clear that he truly thought he would be saving the world and putting Germany in the forefront of being that savior.  Hitler's conclusion was that it would most easily be changed through moving into the political realm.  He specifically outlined his plan for getting access to the political realm and the backing of the people through propaganda.  He even spells out that the propaganda doesn't always have to be true; it just needs to draw a person's attention.  Realistically, when we look back on what he was planning on doing and how he did it, none of the world should have been shocked that this is what would happen.  He pretty clearly outlines where his prejudices are and why he has them.<br /><br />Hitler starts his story as a young boy growing up and becoming disillusioned with the world around him.  His father wouldn't let him do what he really wanted to do, which was art.  He doesn't seem like the over confident Hitler that history portrays today.  In fact I would say the movie \\"Max\\" starring Noah Taylor as Hitler did a pretty good portrayal of that possibility, only that movie was not about Hitler in his High School years, so it was a little unrealistic.  When World War I started Hitler joined the military and I think this is where his confidence in himself really started to take root.  This is also where he became convinced that propaganda was the key to winning the war because upon viewing the enemy's propaganda it was better than what Germany was putting out.  It would appear his assumption was correct; since via propaganda he got many crowds gathered to listen to him speak.<br /><br />Probably the most well known facet of his beliefs is the anti-Semitism that brought on the Holocaust.  He eventually ended up in Vienna and I think this is where his prejudice became firm.  You can see where his theory turns into some sort of paranoid dementia, because before you knew it he was calling everyone on the street a Jew in disgust.  This was mostly based on looking at the person and guessing.  He believed they had penetrated the newspaper industry and were completely lying to everyone in the world.  As Volume I continues you find that eventually this belief grows into him thinking that they also controlled the governments.  I think a lot of this stemmed from one other text, which he mentions in this book \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\"  This is a hoax that has existed for a while and first started getting published in 1897.  I believe the global conspiracy outlined in that book only solidified what Hitler suspected with his newspaper theory.  I was surprised that Hitler had originally wanted to start out as an artist and actually held a few gallery viewings of his work.  I wonder at this point if there is any Hitler original art around.  If I remember correctly I heard actually wasn't a very good artist.  It's interesting to note that as Hitler continues with his tirades I this book, you can tell he has a special soft spot for art because he wants more of that industries presence in Germany.<br /><br />Overall I was surprised at how little anti-Semitism there was in the book in comparison to the length of the text.  I was actually expecting a lot more.  Don't mistake me, he took jabs wherever he possibly could and there was an entire chapter dedicated to the subject.  However, I felt like in the first volume he spent more time criticizing the Slavsand the Austrians as being a much more immediate problem.  It's almost as if the first and foremost problem was his own government and Austria; the issue of the Jewish population was a more of a global problem and probably seemed to be less immediate.  You get a wholly different feel by the time we reach Volume II though.<br /><br />I was also very surprised at the countries he referenced as being respectable, specifically England and America.  He must have been greatly disappointed in England when they refused to side with him during World War II and he must have felt doubly wrong about his initial assessment of America when we funded a lot of his enemies.  Being an American I found some of his comments curious since it seems he felt we had a dominant German aspect of our country.  I found this odd since it was essentially founded by England and France mostly.  I couldn't help but think that Hitler was misinterpreting his history or the books he was reading were just plain wrong.<br /><br />For the most part Hitler is a pretty good writer.  I found that he appears very intelligent and very well read, also very arrogant.  He has sections that discuss the part of his life where he was looking into the political arena and when he came across the German Workers' Party.  He doesn't hesitate to point out how superior his ideas were or how much better things worked when done his way.  From the point of view of a leader, this seems counter to what you would want.  Since his ability to elevate his own status seems to be his main underlying motive rather than helping his people, despite what he actually says.  There is one instance when he was recounting the first speeches given for the party and how the first speaker was rather boring, but when he spoke the crowd became excited and into the words, they stood up and cheered even.  History recounts Hitler as a very excellent speaker and I have no doubt this is true, but it's curious to see that he puts himself over his own party members constantly in this book.  There were also sections where he got very passionate about a topic that became very confusing, as I explained above.  I don't think this speaks to his inability to write, but rather his inability to write clearly when he is really trying to get his point across on a topic he believes as a core problem.<br /><br />Either way you looked at it, I couldn't help but think by the end of Volume I that Hitler would have been one of the world's most celebrated leaders if he had just put his prejudice aside.  This was the case... at least until I read Volume II.  Through Volume I he seems to genuinely want to help his people and the world around him.  The one major crux in his argument is that he believed in some overly prejudice driven conspiracy.  I think Hitler really had to start struggling in the end when it was becoming even clearer that the Jews weren't as well off in Germany as he believed they were, especially during the great depression.  I was surprised at his focus on helping the middle class and a seemingly focal point on intelligence and action.  It appeared his main push to change the nation was centered on elevating the knowledge of the German peoples as well as moving them to the desire for action to help their nation.  I think this is a great point and he's most certainly not wrong about it being needed.  However, my interpretation of this concept would be dashed by Volume II...<br /><br />Volume II made it incredibly clear to me that Hitler had no place in becoming a leader and especially no place on deciding education reform.  Shortly into Volume II he has a lengthy chapter on what he plans to do with education to bolster a more national spirit for young Germans and to create what he refers to as a \\"folkish state\\".  The concept of the \\"folkish state\\" is discussed in great length throughout Volume II and seems to be the main focus.  One of the first things he was going to do was decrease the amount of time in classrooms and increase the amount of time for exercise.  Following this he would decrease the amount of subjects being taught in school.  This completely conflicts with his desire for an intelligent Germany, and he also discusses at length how the intelligentsia of the area are all weaklings and spineless.  He notes that many students learn quite a bit of frivolous subjects in High School, which is true, but I personally believe that being a well rounded student is far better.  I do agree that people need more exercise, this is painfully clear to me living in America, but to sacrifice the access to knowledge is not a viable solution!  He complains at length that too many people complain about certain political actions, but being spineless professors they never actually do anything about it.  Hitler sought to change this and part of this included that right after High School the population (men) would go directly into the military.  Hitler being a Veteran clearly thought his experience taught him strength, so he thought that what was good for him would be good for everyone else.  If only such things were true, this is clearly something that cannot be put into practice.  A lot of these crazy ideas may have seemed plausible on paper, but realistically they are a fool's errand... an errand Hitler was intent on running!  After a citizens completion of Army service they were then allowed into the community to pursue whatever higher level career they saw fit to pursue.  His purpose in High School was to expose the students to enough generalities for them to make a choice, which is a good idea, but his plan of execution was fairly far fetched and unrealistic.  Personally, in 2008, I don't think High Schools are teaching students enough to prepare them for college or to perform in the working world.  So it would seem less education on academics is not the answer, but the world really does need to find some kind of a balance on this subject, even Hitler recognized that and he lived in a vastly different era from our own.<br /><br />Volume II also takes a drastic turn in terms of anti-Semitism and his foreign relations outlook.  England seems to have been demoted into a nation that they could possibly not ally with due to the financial control of the Jewish empire.  The United States was also seen as a victim of this disease, but his knowledge of American finance seems to have been quite limited.  Granted there were some major firms in the U.S. that were founded by German Jews, namely Goldman Sachs, but what about firms like J.P. Morgan?  In terms of the major American firms there was a balance and in the 1930's Goldman Sachs nearly went out of business in the Great Depression, so clearly this racial favoring of economic power was quite unfounded.  I think Hitler spoke on these foreign nations rather out of turn because it was pretty clear he didn't know all that much about the nations and had gotten all of his knowledge from books, which may have been biased.  For he terms Ford as one of the only free American business men, but in the second printing he no longer names Ford specifically, I felt this was curious.  This was a drastic change from my perspective after reading Volume I, where he praised America.  So even within his own book he is very contradictory.  Also the focal point of being against the Slavs and Austrians has been replaced by Germany's mortal enemy... France.  This sort of came out of nowhere, since in Volume I they were not \\"mortal enemies\\" just the regular kind.  Hitler must have read a lot more on the subject and decided the French were far worse than they once appeared.  I find all this curious because he prefaces Volume II, with saying that it's going to be about the party history and formation.  The above topics have nothing to do with the party history or its formation, rather Hitler's own pet peeves about the problems that he saw after World War I.<br /><br />Most of this Volume is spent complaining about current (1920's) Bourgeoisie decision making and discussing what Hitler plans to do to fix that.  I personally wasn't buying it, but then again, his book is so long that I doubt many of the general workers ever actually read what he wrote.  He did spell out in Volume I that he was essentially going to dupe the masses into following him by creating the best propaganda to get people to go to the meetings.  At that point he probably understood the concept of mob madness and let that do the rest for him.  He recounts his early involvement with the party as becoming the head of propaganda, which is what he wanted because he believed propaganda, first and foremost, was the fulcrum to a party's success.  Hitler even points out that it doesn't matter if the party is well organized at that time if the propaganda doesn't bring the masses in, they will have nothing to organize in the first place.  He also discusses at length the rarity of a man who can organize and lead well; I couldn't help but feel that he thought himself to be such a man.  He was a brilliant strategist and acutely aware of the power of the threat of violence on the general populace, especially after a major war that was still fresh in peoples memories.  One of his main points was that he believed that it didn't matter what the people knew as long as an intelligent leader was looking out for them, and it's clear he believed that he was the person that could truly help the most and should be leader.  This is regardless of the violence he would have to inflict; besides he only wanted strong people to be German anyway, so a show of strength went a long way with him.<br /><br />It's interesting to also note that he clearly wanted to rewrite some of the annals of history to favor the German people.  In his long winded explanation of the Folkish State he points out that he believes the Aryan's are the only ones who could ever develop culture.  No, he wasn't referring to the peoples belonging to the nation of India, but rather the Germanic peoples.  See, the term Aryan comes from India, and I have no idea if Hitler knew this or not, but that's its origin.  Indians clearly wouldn't have been high on his list, and certainly didn't qualify as those being able to create culture despite their history of creating that vast nation.  Rather, it appears the legend and concept of the Aryan survived and came down to Hitler as the superior race.  For some reason he equated that with the Germanic peoples.  His whole concept of the white population being the only force intelligent enough to create culture is clearly unfounded.  He gets even more contradictory in this concept since he was well aware that Germany was vastly tribal up until the Roman invasions.  He states the reason was that \\"we were a young people\\".  This is just foolishness because it was trade in technology that eventually brought what we call \\"civilization\\" today to the Germanic tribes.  It has nothing to do with them being the only creative force in the world.  He completely ignores the fact that Egypt existed long before as a civilization.  I question whether he knew of the Arab city-states of Sumer, but it doesn't explain Egypt.  I think Hitler merely viewed them as \\"uncivilized\\" or \\"not a cultured\\" or whatever other twisted elaboration he wanted to thrust upon them.  Either way, he does not explain his reasoning in detail, and just states matter of factly that only Aryans harbor the creative force to develop culture and no one else.<br /><br />Overall I walked away with reading a superb book, in my opinion.  At times it was very hard to read and I will be the first to admit that not everyone will struggle through this thing.  There are too many sections of rambling that don't drive home the main points.  It all sounds very smart at first glance, but when you sit down and analyze what he's saying inherent contradictions come to the surface.  Then it occurs to the reader that most of his language use is merely superfluous for the sake of sounding intelligent (much like this sentence).  No one wants an incredibly inconsistent leader (however, I feel like that's all we get at times!).  Despite the racial hatred, I am glad I read this book, it gives me a great historical perspective and I now understand where Hitler was coming from.  On a philosophical note, it really makes me think of the concept of evil and how that plays into perspectives.  From Hitler's perspective he thought he was saving his people.  He thought he was actually saving the world from the greatest threat and he really thought the other nations would see the truth that he saw and back him up.  Alas, for Hitler he was chasing after rumors and ghosts that didn't actually exist.<br /><br />In reading this I also couldn't help but wonder about what the world is like today.  Lots of \\"what if\\" questions come to mind.  Despite the incredible tragedy that Hitler wrought on so many lives, it was really the need to ramp up production of war elements that brought the world out of the great depression.  So Hitler really did end up helping the world in this sense by provoking everyone to action.  He also motivated the world to increase production and research into massive amounts of technology.  Atomic energy might not have come to us as soon as it has without this provocation.  I can't deny this factor.  Also, I have to look at the historical perspective that the country I now reside in is the major world power because of Hitler's actions against Europe!  Many people will probably consider these horrible thoughts, but I can't deny the reality of the situation and it leaves me to wonder that if Hitler had become the artist he always wanted to be, would we be in the same situation?  Would Israel exist today if he never came to power?  After World War II the Cold War went quickly into effect and I wonder if I would even have the internet to relay my ideas if World War II had never taken place, since that also forced us to ramp up production and research in technology.  As a philosophical perspective these are all very profound concepts and questions.  Despite all the horror that was wrought in the war, if you step back with the utilitarian perspective of Mills and look at all that has come out of the war that has elevated our lives and the economy as a whole.<br /><br />On the reverse side, what if Hitler had actually succeeded in what he wanted to do?  Israel surely wouldn't exist today.  Would Christianity be the same?  Since he seemed to respect Christianity and he was surely no atheist, so would his disdain for the Jewish people provoke him to edit the Bible down to just the New Testament?  I've already said before that he clearly sought to rewrite history and I don't think anything would be out of his grasp.  I do know one thing for sure though, I wouldn't have been able to read all the books I have under a reign like that, and I most surely would not have been able to criticize this book as I have in such a society.  Thankfully his party was not in power for a long time, but apparently long enough to change the world.mount of subjects being taught in school.  This completely conflicts with his desire for an intelligent Germany, and he also discusses at length how the intelligentsia of the area are all weaklings and spineless.

B000YPUFA6|5.0|The action in this movie very intense. Zombies taking over the world because of one corporation that couldn't keep anything under wraps. The only girl that can save the world is also discovering her own new powers, while at the same time keeping what's left if the worlds non-zombie population alive.    The reason I gave this movie a five star review is because it's so much more different then all the other zombie movies. They actually tell you how zombies came into play. While also adding a twist in the story plot. It is the best one so far in the three movie series.
B0012Y22KO|5.0|Are these CD's remastered/upgraded from the versions that were originally issued on CD?    (It would make sense, since the sound quality varied so greatly among Toto's CD releases.  But the marketing info available so far is completely silent about that particular detail)  Anyone?.....hello?
1400082773|5.0|I just can't imagine how anyone could vote for Hilary or McCain after reading this book. Obama approaches and even comes close to being a major American writer. His ability to think and understand the complexities of history and people is astounding. He is so far superior, mentally and in terms of character, to any other politician I have seen. It would be thrilling to have a leader of this country who really had the depth and intellect to lead. I have written a lot on literature and politics -- one of my books is \\"Literary L.A.\\" -- and this book is stupendous.<br /><br />Lionel Rolfe
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Yes, there are very few Chick Singer bands that I enjoy, probably because it feels weird to sing along with them.  No Doubt was great back in the day.  Evanescence and Flyleaf have done well for themselves.  I was a big Hole and The Muffs fan for about one album and even Babes In Toyland.  And Superchick and BarlowGirl have there moments.  But in the world of rock, it is a man's world...until Hayley Williams has come and shown that she is the real deal.  Paramore's Riot is exciting, and although it is not necessarily original in the sound, it is somehow fresh.  From the beginning guitar in \\"For A Pessimist...\\" I was hooked.  This album is catchy, exploding with bursts of pop-punk energy.  Of course, \\"Misery Business\\" is an awesome song, but there are many other great songs on this album.

B000E33VWW|1.0|Like the title says...this movie is very slow moving and the plot is very boring. Then when the end comes along you expect something great, but no, just a bland ending to a bland movie. Perhaps if you like to look at movies on a \\"deeper\\" level than simple entertainment you might possibly find this movie interesting. The only plus side of this was the fine acting of the character Truman Capote. He kept the annoying voice consistant throughout the film and the consistancy of lacking almost any emotion was done quite well.

0140135154|5.0|Even though \\"Ways of Seeing\\" is a flawed book in many ways, it is so seminal in the development of post-modern image making that it must be considered essential reading in critical theory.<br /><br />The book is based on a television series.  The book itself is only 176 pages.  The print is all in a bold, sans-serif font.  The authors are quick to claim that the book was made, not written.  The pictures used to demonstrate the points are small and in black and white.<br /><br />The book is based on the theory that the interpretation of western art evolved out of the power and finance structure of western civilization.  Inevitably books that describe the world primarily in economic terms, as an arena of conflict and a battle by the rich for dominance of the poor, are referred to by some as Marxist and I have no doubt this book has been so described.<br /><br />The book has seven chapters, four of which are written and three of which are reproductions of art works without words.  The theme developed is that the way people view art is strongly affected by the power structure of the society.<br /><br />I must confess that the three chapters that were solely illustrated were difficult for me to engage, both because of the size of the images as well as the difficulty of following the thread which I felt ran through the pictures even though I was not able to decode the message.<br /><br />The first chapter is based on and explicates the work of the critic Walter Benjamin in his essay, \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\".  Unlike Benjamin, who sometimes seems torn between the loss of the aura of the original and the benefit of mass accessibility, Berger seems to believe that real benefits will derive from the reproduced work of art, if the viewer can sweep away the lenses of the past through which he might view the work.<br /><br />The third chapter deals with the role of art in the commodification of women and the fifth chapter examines the role of oil painting in the reduction of people's world view to a matter of money.  (Burger only excepts the work of a few artists, like Rembrandt, from this view.)  The final chapter is based upon the use of images for marketing.<br /><br />This work is important because, if it did not shape the outlook of post-modern art, it was at least in the vanguard of recognizing the roles of the art that preceded post-modernism, and led to the rejectionist point of view.<br /><br />Berger is clear in emphasizing that the way we view art is filtered through the prism of culture in the sociological sense, although that certainly was not ground breaking in critical theory, even at the time of first publication.  On the other hand, here was art criticism first presented on what was then a new media, television.  Even the book format, such as using a bold-faced font throughout the book, appealed to the avant-garde.<br /><br />Burger would substitute art, not as a tool to help preserve an economic and power system, but rather as a way for the consumer of art to enrich his own life.<br /><br />I suspect that artists other then post-modernists may not benefit very much in their work from reading \\"Ways of Seeing\\".  On the other hand, if you have a serious interest in critical theory, even though you may reject Berger's thesis, you must read this book.to a matter of money.

1582701709|4.0|There is a big difference between believing and wanting to believe. People who read books like The Secret wants to believe. This means they don't believe. When they think \\"I'm wealthy!\\", this thought contradicts what  they are feeling: the fear of not have enough. And the feeling is what they really believe.So the crucial factor is - \\"How could I be free of my negative feelings,the real beliefs I have?\\" Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ revelead the Secret: \\"do not resist evil!\\"   To have something - money, health, love - one needs TO BE THAT. This means TO FEEL AS I WERE ALREADY RICH, HEALTHY, LOVER.To Be, not just to think. That's why Jesus Christ, the true revelator of the Secret, said: \\"if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt IN HIS HEART...\\" The heart is the home of feelings. But how can one not doubt in his heart? The answer: if one believes in God - believes in Absolute GOOD - then fear,poverty, sickness are impossible, nothing. And the contradiction between thoughts and feelings ends.
B000YKE87W|2.0|Listening to Jonas Kaufmann's debut recital disc, I can't help thinking what a great baritone he'll make sometime in the future.  Not that he doesn't have the notes, but this is a heavy, robust voice one rarely associates with the tenor repertory.  There's no ping, no lightness in tone, nothing that would make the high notes really soar; instead they're pinched out, fairly strangulated and sometimes off-pitch.  There's certainly passion to Kaufmann's singing, and power, but forget poetry.  I would agree that he excels in the German pieces here, so perhaps there's more Wagner in his future.  Or at least some Germonts and Rodrigos.

B000E8N690|4.0|A good film, emotionally moving and powerful. Joaquin Phoenix did a good, brooding acting job as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was extraordinary as June Carter: strong, perky, principled, and loving, and a damned fine performer.<br /><br />The symbolism (falling down, slamming doors) was a thought heavy-handed, but the film was well-made and authentic in feeling if not always in look. With some movies that cover my early days, I feel the almost physical shock of recognition of the world I knew then. I never felt that in this film, but I may be getting jaded.<br /><br />Johnny Cash comes across as a man of grit, honesty, and persistence, capable of both compassion and great love, but also as a bastard with a mean streak a mile wide. He seems to have come by it naturally. Although Johnny Cash's mother was a hardworking woman with a sweet singing voice, she does not come across as a strong character. Her drunken, judgmental husband never forgave Johnny for surviving when his older, smarter brother died. Later on, she sat silent while her husband gibed at his successful son.  Johnny Cash endured a lifetime of rejection and verbal abuse from his father -- and dumped it on anyone who got in his way, including June Carter.<br /><br />The film left me wondering about the stereotype of the artist as a selfish jerk. How accurate is it, generally? Does it have to be that way? What role does the nastiness and short temper play for the artist? I could see it as a smokescreen generated by a hypersensitive individual to keep people distant or just as a reaction to the intolerable stress of fame. I can also see it as arising from a sense of privilege--acting badly because they deserve better than others, or simply because their fame and money let them get away with it.<br /><br />I don't fall for the idea that the Arteeeeeste is a higher life form who can be forgiven anything. But I wonder how much art has been lost because the potential artist is too damned nice to create emotional space for the work.

You wouldn't go wrong with this Disney movie.
B0012BTBQU|5.0|I discovered Brandon Sanderson thanks to his being selected to finish the final book of Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" Fantasy epic following the unfortunate death of Mr. Jordan.  I am happy to report that Sanderson is a brilliant and talented writer.  My apprehension about the fate of \\"A Memory of Light\\" has been erased completely.    Mistborn:  The Final Empire is an excellent read.  I became so engrossed in the book that I finished it in less than three days.  The sequel is just as good, and I cannot wait until I can get my hands on the third book of the trilogy.  In fact, the story is so good that even though I finished these two books two days ago, I am already reading it again.  Yes, it was THAT good.  I have never before reread a book so soon after the first read.    I can also recommend \\"Elantris\\", also by Brandon Sanderson.

B00004STUL|3.0|This is one of Michael Bays Earlier films that re-explore the buddy cop genre, only difference is that both cops are of the same ethnical group, and it combines comedy with some great fueled action scenes. Talking about action; it has some good moments but they are only present at the end of the picture. Through the rest of the film were just sitting watching two trigger happy cops talking and at times insulting each other. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad movie, but it lacks motivation. Call me modern but the movie at times its so boring, slow, and very dated. I know that things getting old in movies is inevitable but here it feels to 90s. for example there's a scene involving Will Smith talking on a cell phone- now what could be wrong with that, well the cell phone is huge it's like from the 90s. Whatever it may seem silly that I'm bragging about a cell phone and some other details, when you watch it you will know what I mean.<br /><br />As for the story of the movie, it begins with some drug dealers braking in to the Miami Beach Police Department to steal a load of confiscated cocaine. They come in thru the ventilation shaft and steal the load. In the morning these two cops (Will Smith, Martin Lawrence) are notified about the incident. Elsewhere one of the drug dealers decides to steal some of the cocaine, and is pursued by his boss and fellow partners; he is shot and killed along with a prostitute. Only thing the bad guys weren't counting on was that there is was a witness and she knows  about these two cops, and is in search of justice. now both cops have a short period of time to protect the girl and get back the drugs before they are sold to the highest bidder.<br /><br />It is an interesting story, but the movie fails to bring the story to its full potential. Instead it relies on racist jokes, a lot of cursing, unnecessary dumb moments. There's even a trading places moment (watch it you will know what I mean) anyhow it's a good movie to watch once, it is kind of entertaining and funny but it lacks a lot of originality.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5ning and funny but it lacks a lot of originality.       MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5
B000MRAAJM|3.0|Every two minutes my jaw is dropping at the amazing hi-def images the cinematographers were able to capture for this documentary. The narrator is top notch and the BBC orchestra simply outdid itself this time.<br /><br />There aren't too many collections I can honestly recommend to anyone - but Planet Earth can easily capture the imagination of young through old and across all types of people.<br /><br />My big complaint - and this goes towards my values on ... well ... value, is the exclusion of the 110 minutes of diary footage at the end of each segment. My parents have the DVD version of this and they rave about how great that footage is and to be honest, I feel like I'm missing out on half of the experience, even though it is only a 110 minutes combined.<br /><br />I also am upset I've been charged almost double for the Blu Ray version then the standard def version and the extra disc about \\"looking forward\\" is excluded as well! I bought this when it first came out and I wasn't aware the extra footage wasn't included. If I had known I probably would have just rented it from the video store or borrowed it.<br /><br />Yes the images are truly amazing and the best I've seen on my 52-inch television, but owning this isn't as great without the extra footage. I bought it because it's the type of thing (the actual docs and the extra footage) I could see myself showing to friends and family over and over again, but not as much w/o that footage.<br /><br />Hence my three star rating - with extra footage and disc - 5 stars, but I was charged double for less.

It's unabashedly derivative pop, but is that bad?<br /><br />The production values are high; these guys know how to play their instruments, though they're not prodigies. Best tracks? \\"Mansard Roof\\" (what the heck is a Mansard Roof?), \\"Oxford Comma\\" (drops the F-bomb right off the bat in a bubble gummy way), \\"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance,\\" and the Youtube video for \\"A-Punk\\" is great silly silly fun.<br /><br />Go ahead and play the samples if they're on Amazon. Vampire Weekend gets into their riffs pretty quickly, so you'll be able to tell pretty quickly if they're your cup of tea, or not.<br /><br />All in all, a nice album to have in a collection. In 20 years they'll end up on a \\"K-Tel's Greatest Hits\\" holographic music cube with their songs running next to Tony Orlando's \\"Knock Three Times\\" or Melanie's \\"I've Got a Brand New Key.\\" And I mean that in a good way!

0151013047|2.0|I found nothing original in this book, everything sounded familiar, and the whole sentimentality of Erica and her ending was predictable from the very beginning.

B0000C9JFO|5.0|Ah, yes, why can't all our college experiences be this cool? Instead of rooming with a control freak-esque local girl in a run-down flat in a northeastern college town, wouldn't it have been great if I'd lived with a bunch of cool people in Spain? Oh, well.<br /><br />I find it hard to describe what this movie is about, so I'll leave it to others who have no doubt done a fine job of detailing its quirky, thin-yet-rich plot. To say it depicts the inner landscape of a young Frenchman's evolving personality as it concerns itself with interaction among co-habiting European students from all corners of the continent doesn't do it justice or explain much at all. I'll only say I enjoyed the fast-moving L'Auberge Espagnole and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing a stylish young cast clash and bond under the wide blue skies of Barcelona and amid the scenery of ultra-modern twenty-first-century Europe.<br /><br />Merely by packing seven good-looking multinational young people into a small Spanish apartment you'd have a watchable tale right there, but Cedric Klapisch goes much farther by working in subplots about an adulterous affair, long-distance relationships, ethnic stereotyping, and the debt owed to one's personal past. \\"European Pudding\\" has winsome performances, funny moments---Wendy's brother taking a bullet for her by jumping into bed with the half-naked American troubadour was completely hilarious--- and is an intelligent, likable movie!<br /><br />So, Cedric, when can we look forward to seeing part three?
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Despite its plodding plotline, \\"Caligula\\" excels in its sheer extravagance. There seems no better subject for such a movie than the emperor Caligula, and the movie is a fascinating clash of the excesses of ancient Rome and the excesses of modern Western society. It is so mindnumbingly lavish that one cannot help but enjoy it. Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole and Helen Mirren make excellent performances, which none of them have yet publicly regretted, but it seems their presence is more significant as names on the movie poster than adding any real quality to the movie itself. The true credit of the movie's succeses go to Danilo Donati, who created the sets and costumes (also Fellini's art director), and Bob Guccione, the producer who pushed the limits of the movie's decadence (also founder and publisher of Penthouse, the company that produced \\"Caligula\\"). Gore Vidal's original screenplay is reportedly nearly unrecognizable in this final cut of the movie, which is unsurprising given the unremarkable dialogue and storyline that does little more than fill in space. Nonetheless, \\"Caligula\\" is delightfully repulsive, the height of trash, and a rightful classic

B00140PK6O|5.0|\\"Cranford\\" is at once a delightful and winning BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's literary works. While lacking the narrative focus of \\"Wives and Daughters\\" and \\"North and South,\\" \\"Cranford\\" still comes out to top crest owing largely to a collection of likeable characters played by veteran and other well-known British actors, and also owing to a masterful interweaving of several storylines taken from Mrs. Gaskell's novel \\"Cranford,\\" and her other smaller works (novellas,) such as \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr. Harrison's Confessions.\\" What could have been a trite exercise comes out fresh because of these qualities.<br /><br />At the onset, the bucolic and fictional town of Cranford seems quiet and trapped in a former century. But nothing is ever quiet especially where gossiping ladies are concerned; and no \\"backward\\" town can forever stay asleep, not when a proposed railway which will connect it with other busier counties (such as Manchester) is about to disturb the peace and change town life forever. This is the foundation with which the storylines of \\"Cranford\\" are set, told in an era where change has been steadily making headways, and the social strata seem to be balancing out.<br /><br />It should be noted, however, that while \\"Cranford\\" imparts to its viewers a sense of things on the verge of change, romance and social satire are still the order of the day. Making up the romantic aspect of \\"Cranford\\" are pairs of lovers who are kept apart either by mischief of fate, familial obligations, or class difference. Complementing these are subplots about a sister's longing for a long-lost brother, a mother's longing for an absent son, and silly feminine passions that explode to embarrassing proportions on two occasions. \\"Cranford\\" is also replete with satire, as evidenced by its comedy of manners. It spends an amount of its time poking fun at cackling and gossiping ladies. Ultimately, these gossips harm not only their victims, but also the perpetrators themselves, in more ways than one. Other themes of the period are the upper-class bigotry against the education of the lower-class, and also the clinging on to traditions that do no good in the end (as evidenced by Lady Ludlow's decision with regards to a part of her land.) Comparison is also made between the professional attitudes (and aptitudes) of the elder Dr. Morgan and the younger Dr. Harrison.<br /><br />The descriptions I gave above may mislead you readers to think of \\"Cranford\\" as dismal and small. On the contrary, \\"Cranford\\" has a big heart, in the way its inhabitants show charity, neighborliness and compassion when called for. \\"Nothing like this is ever done in London,\\" comments our young Dr. Harrison on the ladies' generosity. Even the prejudiced Lady Ludlow (played by Francesca Annis) takes a good turn when she spoke to the magistrate on behalf of a poacher who was also wrongly accused of assaulting someone in the night. Amidst all these, Dame Judi Dench plays the younger Jenkyn sister and she somewhat embodies Cranford, which is now on the brink of breaking out to the wave of social changes happening in other places. She had lived under the shadow of her loving but stern sister for most of her life, and we always sense in her some wild undercurrent ready to break out of the mold.<br /><br />Dames Eileen and Judi, playing the two Jenkyn sisters who never married, are truly a joy to watch. It's so nice to see them in bonnets and in more congenial surroundings. See veteran performances in action (I wished that Dame Maggie Smith were also here, I so much adore her as I do Dames Eileen and Judi.) These two formidable actresses aside, who can beat this roster of veteran actors and other well-knowns who took part in the production: Sir Michael Gambon, Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, Julia McKenzie, Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Julia Sawalha, and others. The cast is top rate and so are the production values, which have always been the hallmark of the BBC television series enterprise. Fans of BBC's \\"Wives and Daughters\\" will not be disappointed with this one.<br /><br />A point of interest: Hardcore literature buffs may not take kindly to the creative liberties that the filmmakers took with Mrs. Gaskell's works. In the Bonus Features Interview, they admit to changing the fates of certain characters: some died who were supposed to live, and some lived who were supposed to die. And yes, as with \\"Wives and Daughters\\" and \\"North and South,\\" \\"Cranford\\" has its own lot of untimely and diseased deaths, in an era where modern medicine was just making early breakthroughs. One particular death scene near the end (where a leg needed to be amputated) might disturb younger viewers.<br /><br />Speaking during the interview, producer Sue Birtwistle mentioned the possibility of a sequel should \\"Cranford\\" do very well. I'd be bold enough to speak in behalf of fans: We certainly hope that a follow-up comes soon. At five episodes, \\"Cranford\\" feels like a joyous ride that ended too soon. Fans certainly like to be \\"BBC-spoiled\\" now and then. If this were to come true, I hope to see more British veteran actors (particularly Dame Maggie) taking part in Mrs. Gaskell's insightful stories.<br /><br />*Comes with English subtitlesFans of BBC's \\"Wives and Daughters\\" will not be disappointed with this one.

B0010V4TZU|3.0|An impressive debut album, and yes it is pretty original- they sound a lot like the police and the shins mixed into one poppy sounding band- but while they are creative, only about 2 songs really stand out. All of the songs sound a bit the same, but it's not necessarilly a bad thing. The main problem, in my opinion, is that the album opener and closer (probably the two most important songs on any album) are pretty weak. But all in all it's definatly worth picking up for any indie fan, and I have high hopes for a great sophmore album.

It has the soil, water, light, and climate requirements for every genus of CP, plus tips on where to grow them from a bog garden to a terrarium to a windowsill. It shows you how to grow every plant from Dionea muscipula (Venus Flytrap) to Nepenthes (Tropical Pitcher Plant) to more commonly grown plants of the 130 species of Drosera (Sundew). You can truly know how to grow any carnivorous plant with this book. And to make everything better the author is the amazing Peter D'Amato who has been growing CP's for nearly 40 years and has ran the California Carnivores nursery since 1989 (which happens to be the largest CP shop in the U.S. and the same nursery I buy my CP's from).

0385006896|5.0|Here, in a single volume authorized by the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, are the definitive versions of the 56 short stories and four novels about Doyle's most famous literary character, Sherlock Holmes. Together, the stories and novels comprise what is still the finest collection of English language detective fiction in existence. Sherlock Holmes, whose first appearance in print was in 1887, continues to fill the public mind as the iconic private detective. Holmes and his friend and collaborator Dr. Watson enjoy a continuing existence in various film adaptations of the original stories, most notably Grenada Television's recent series starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke.<br /><br />This volume opens with an excellent introductory essay by Christopher Morley, which puts both the Holmes legend and his creater in perspective. Following is the initial Holmes story, \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", which introduces us to Dr. Watson, formerly a medical officer in the British Army, now on half-pay convalescence as a result of a wound suffered in Afghanistan. Dr. Watson needs a roommate. A mutual aquaintance introduces him to one Sherlock Holmes, a self-styled consulting detective. Watson becomes interested in one of Holmes'cases, and we the readers are off and running. After \\"The Sign of Four\\", the \\"Adventures\\" and the \\"Memoirs\\", Conan Doyle tried to kill off his very popular character to make room for other literary projects. Popular pressure compelled Doyle to resurrect Holmes, who went on to star in the \\"Return\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", \\"The Valley of Fear\\", \\"His Last Bow\\", and \\"The Casebook.\\"<br /><br />The formula is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans. A card, letter, or visitor to 221-B Baker Street typically introduces a new case with some unusual or bizarre element worthy of the eccentric Holmes's special skills and collaboration with Dr. Watson, his endlessly patient friend and nominal biographer to the British public. The story settings are typically London or some private home or school in England; two stories have flashback settings in the United States. If the stories are very much set in late Victorian and Edwardian England, they continue to translate well to a modern audience.<br /><br />For this reviewer, the best story is \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" with its plot of a ancient family seemingly haunted by a deadly curse involving a spectral hound that turns out to be very real.  The novel nicely balances a first person narrative by Dr. Watson with letters to a frequently off-stage Holmes.  The narrative builds steadily from its opening scenes in London to a thrilling climax on remote and wild Dartmoor.<br /><br />This complete collection of Sherlock Holmes is very highly recommended to fans of the famous detective and to those persons who so far know Holmes only through movies or the TV series.n or some private home or school in England; two stories have flashback settings in the United States.

B0013ND30M|5.0|I think the story line was great. The villian is one of the coolest ever. Music was great too. One of my favorite Disney movies. Not as good as Cinderella or Snow White, but a great Disney classic for people young and old to watch!
0307394549|2.0|When I saw this \\"new\\" book, I was very excited because I have the Holiday/Christmas Cookie Book from a few years ago and I thought \\"Awesome, more cookie recipes!\\"  Avast, no...as another reviewer has pointed out, it basically is a re-hash of the Holiday/Christmas Cookie Book, and recipes that are available on the Martha Stewart website.  :o(
B000YXMMAO|2.0|I echo what the others have said. This is a great album, but the pressing is terrible. In addition to the \\"dead\\" sound, mine arrived with a chip out it (the package was fine).
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Fans of \\"Breach\\" should definitely see this fascinating view of an agents life. Mostly focused in the 1960s and some more current proceedings that influenced our foreign policy and the very fiber of our intelligence network. Matt Damon plays \\"Mother\\" deftly, he is known as a cold calculating agent by his counterparts. We see his lifestyle take it's toll on his family, and the true conviction of many CIA agents. If you enjoy the dryer spy movies that tell more fact than fiction without lots of gadgets, you will probably enjoy this movie. Good quality DVD with a few extras and decent replayability.
B000UFAURI|4.0|This is a great album for any FF fan. I like and I hate how people are complaining how it sounds different or even boring. Yes, some of the songs may be slower compared to their previous albums but Dave Grohl mentioned in an interview that he doesn't want every album to sound the same. I love Let It Die because it starts off slow but then towards the end it gets loud. The arena rock that we all know and love from FF. This album shows how FF has matured over the years. I have to admit that the slower songs like \\"Home\\" took a while to warm up to me, but listen to the lyrics and you'll like it.
B000ZOXDFA|1.0|I have to admit I did not see the movie, nor shall I.  I am a great fan of Elizabeth I, she held England together at a horrible time in history.  As soon as I saw her depicted in armor, I knew it was going to be a fairy tale.    What a shame to waste the talents of Cate Blanchett on something that ranges so far from the truth.
B00005JPTK|2.0|Plot line differences:    The dog: The fact that he started off with the dog was a disappointment.  In the book, he was nearly insane with loneliness by the time he found the dog, and it saves his sanity.  Either they should have stuck to the source or not borrowed this from it.    The monsters:  In both book and previous movies they were still fairly intelligent, could talk and plot against him, and  in the end formed their own society.  Were where the mental chess games between him hunting and them hiding?  I'd be ok with some major changes here, but they still need to show more hunting and seeking than just two scenes.    His house: In both the book and the movie it was an impenetrable fortress, which led to its own claustrophobic problems.  I loved in the book how they would call to him and wage psychological games with him, like the women flashing him anytime he looked out the window, and taunting him to come out and play.  I the origian movie they would call to him and throw things at the house.  This was completely left out of this movie.  When they did \\"find\\" his house they broke through the iron gates and barred windows in a matter of seconds.  This was unbelievable, porely explained, and a total let down.    While I am disappointed with the writers, the acting was fairly good.  I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, but I am not sorry I watched it on DVD, and I will probably buy the two disk set just to see the alternate ending which I have not yet viewed. Perhaps it is better.    Overall a C+.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Is it an exceptionally dark musical or the flashiest drama about death ever filmed?  Both!  What makes this film so fascinating is the integration of virtuoso song-and-dance numbers with penetrating portraiture of a man on the brink of self-destruction, all wrapped up in a handsomely cinematic package.  Joe Gideon (a thinly-veiled stand-in for director Bob Fosse, played with terrific natural gusto by the late great Roy Scheider) is obsessed with two things: work and death.  We follow him through his exhausting outer life of the former and his tormented inner relationship with the latter, yet despite all this heaviness and bad vibes the movie is never less than 100% entertaining and engaging.  Brilliantly acted, shot, edited and choreographed, ALL THAT JAZZ stands as one of the last triumphs of the 1970s American New Wave.
0143143492|2.0|Since I had read Tolle 10 or 15 years ago, I thought I would try this volume with all its hype. It is a major disappointment and virtually unreadable. When I read Tolle before I considered his writings with those of Martin Buber. This book is a big nothing and I simply cannot understand its credibility as a \\"spiritual\\" book, unless there are a lot of over age 50 women who have never read a meaningful philosophical or spiritual work before in their lives.  And, yes, I am over 50, but at least I have read Kant, Buber, the Koran, the Bible, etc. I guess this book is pop thought for this year.
B0010ZR160|1.0|This could've been a half hour after school special about how children are likely only a product of their environment.  Instead, we are treated to a two hour quotidian and caustic performance by Bennifer's widdle brother and his barely perceptible girlfriend.  Bennifer's brother opens with a narration which sets the pungent tone for the rest of this film.  Why must everything associated with Bennifer and his frequent companion, Matt Damon, be associated with Boston?  Ok Ben, we get it....you're from New England now can you go away?  If I had to look at one more obese drunken soak wearing a Red Sox cap, I was going to emit my supper.    The opening narration by Junior Bennifer is so banal and ultimately pointless.  I'm convinced it's sole purpose was to let the viewer know how grating yet forgettable this picture would be.  I won't go into every detail that I found implausible, but just to list a few:  Junior Bennifer somehow knows every con in the city, yet is apparently hated by most of them.  Junior Bennifer is approximately 5'6 145 lbs, yet he mouths off to at least five hardened thugs and suffers nary the slightest scratch.    The seasoned detectives allow Junior Bennifer behind the curtain and supply him with investigative information despite the fact that they're in on the misgivings.  My brain can only handle thinking about this slop for so long so I'll wrap up with one final though.  The entire bar scene with the masked gun toting lunatic was useless, and simply served as a means to end with more gunshots and a dramatic slumped over declaration.    In closing, Bennifer and family think they created some controversial theme here.  They think they're being artistic with the opening narration and the foul mouthed walking DYFS case mother.  The truth is that they created a forgettable, oily, nonsensical picture that Morgan Freeman should have run screaming from.
B000TFINY6|4.0|Lost Season 3 was a great season with the usual cliff hangers.<br /><br />The first time Lost was available on DVD in High Def. Doesnt look much clearer from the High Def tv show but still great to enjoy on your Blu Ray player if you are a fan of lost.<br /><br />Would be nice to get Lost Season 1 and 2 in Blu Ray as well to complete the collection thus far.
B0013FBS20|5.0|We just got through watching this movie in surround sound, and man, I can't say enough about it. This movie was GREAT! The special FX, computer FX, plot, story, everything, just great. And man, does it keep you on the edge of your seat! Whew! I have a headache from being so tensed up! My absolute favorite parts were: when he detonated the \\"emergency perimeter manager\\". COOOOL! Man, that house went boom! The way everything was lifted up off the ground, what awesome effects! I had to replay that a few times...just plain cool! Another great moment was at the end when he 'met the creature in the middle' with a nice surprise. I, of course, hated the dog getting killed, cause I am a huge dog lover....but I saw it coming. The great dogs almost always die in films like this. I was kinda hoping that he would get the creature's girlfriend and push her to the window and say \\"see...she's better!\\" haha! But, nah, that's not what he decided to do! This one is a keeper!
0765309408|1.0|I bought this book with the expectation of something new in the way of military science fiction.  Ultimately the book proved to lack much in the way of character development and originality.  The main character easily jumps past moral quandaries with a pause and a sigh.  Perhaps it is an unfair comparison, but the Forever War deals with alienation in a much more effective way.     Ultimately, it reads like John Wayne of the future with the main character saving the day in multiple, and very tired ways. All of the \\"surprises\\" were  predictable and uninspiring and the hints of self-doubt are pushed aside like so many alien carcasses.     I highly recommend avoiding this book.
B000083C49|4.0|You'd think that after a bare bones edition release several years ago this 'Special Edition' would be a definite upgrade.    Bar the 2nd Disc which makes it a good Special Edition extras wise this package suffers:-    The DVD picture is marred with film dirt, specs, blemishes and is as grainy in scenes.  TBH it's like watching a Pirate copy.    Put this on my 84\\" Projector after watching 2 Indiana Jones movies also 'Paramount' 2003 released titles and boy the difference was day and night.    The Indiana Jones movies were the next best thing to High Definition until we actually get HD DVD releases or Blu Ray.    Why they couldn't give their much loved Star Trek franchise this treatment I don't know.    Star Trek V suffers from the same problem picture wise and also isn't framed correctly.  2, 3 and 6 are acceptable.  I don't know about 1 as I never liked that one and give it a miss.    In a nutshell be careful if you're to fork out on a whole set either bundled or seperately of these current Star Trek Movie Special Editions as they are. You may even be double dipping for the 2nd S.E. disc hoping that the Feature itself has a Picture and Audio boost.    I've just bought 2,3,4,5 and 6 and I'm raging at the lacklustre Picture quality on the whole.    Shame on you Paramount for being lazy and providing low quality DVD for such a high quality franchise.    Get your finger out and upgrade these now both new SD and HD releases should be forthcoming soon IMHO and long over due!!

B000M5AJQS|4.0|OK so this isn't Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy or Goodfellas but its film-making in a different class from most of what comes out of Hollywood today. It doesn't quite deserve five stars but if you've given it less than three then maybe mob movies aren't your thing anyway.<br /><br />A cracking cast, all give fine performances. This is certainly the best thing I've seen Leonardo Decaprio do, by quite a margin. Jack Nicolson is in top form and there are some good smaller roles for both Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Scorcese directs with the pace and panache that you've come to expect from the director of the five classics above.<br /><br />It is a remake of the Hong Kong movie \\"Infernal Affairs\\", and Scorcese gives full credit to that movie in the credits. Lets not forget that many of the classics Scorcese directed above were influenced by earlier films (see The Public Enemy 1931 as a good example).<br /><br />This is a hugely entertaining film and strongley recommended.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|I never saw the theatrical version of this film (few did).  Therefore, I can judge my reaction according to what director Ridley Scott intended.  This version weighs in at over 3 hours and you do become aware of time while watching it.  That is NOT to say it drags.  It doesn't.  It just seems a bit too long.  Yet everything included NEEDS to be there.    Scott is one of those directors who can't resist CGI.  His uneven use of falling, swirling snowflakes is particularly annoying in the opening sequences because they look as fake as they are and add little or nothing to the goings-on.  Later there is much \\"artificial\\" blood and mud splattering that is also a trade mark of his.  This is especially obvious on my Blu-Ray edition.  That aside, the rest of the movie is spectacular.  The massive armies on the march and in battle look genuine as opposed to computerized, the latter being a particular sore point for me with most current epics such as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy among others.  The cast is first-rate including Orlando Bloom who is in almost every scene, Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons and David Thewlis among all the others.  Historical or not, this is an interesting and entertaining movie about the Crusades era, a period rarely dealt with in Hollywood.  Larger than life, sure.  Larger than Ridley Scott's imagination?  Probably not.  He's sure to top it next time around.
B00026WU4G|4.0|\\"Infidels\\" is undoubtedly Bob Dylan's best album from the 1980s. It marks a significant move away from his \\"gospel\\" phase of the late 70s/early 80s but neverthless still drips with religious imagery. The songs \\"Jokerman\\", \\"Sweetheart Like You\\", \\"Licence to Kill\\", and \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight\\" are among his best work and the other songs are also interesting with the political commentary of \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" and \\"Union Sundown\\".
0345457692|3.0|The idea is interesting. The \\"sleeve\\" concept is scary and intriguing. But the plot plods. At times I struggle. Overall, mediocre.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I've read the good and bad reviews of this movie and have taken both into account.<br />First, let me tell you that I absolutely love the Beatles' music - there's no other group that can compare before or since, and there is not a day that I don't listen to at least one of their songs.<br />That being said - - - -<br />\\"Across the Universe\\" is an ethereal movie that blends the 21st century with the 1960's in a pseudo sort of way. It has the imagery of the '60's with a 21st century feel. I do not believe the producers of this film meant for it to be a docudrama, as a few reviewers seem to have alluded to. I think it is a form of a protest movie, by way of Viet Nam, against the Iraq war being fought today, hence the blending of the two generations.<br />OK, the names of the characters (Lucy, Max, Jude, Sadie, Prudence, JoJo) are a little bit contrived, but it makes it almost a game to see which Beatle name would be used next (when Max yells out Jude! Jude! Jude! ala Paul McCartney in one scene, I burst out laughing).<br />The use of the music was definitely cool. Being an extreme fan of the original tunes, I thought the way the songs were arranged were very imaginative, especially \\"Hold Me Tight.\\" Yeah, a couple of tunes dragged a bit (\\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\"), but, in many cases (like when \\"Revolution\\" is sung), it works very well. The '60's flavored psychedelia in a couple numbers was interesting as well.<br />The story line was nothing special, but then, I could say the same thing about many blockbuster movies. I'm sure the producers were not so concerned about the script as they were about making the music work to their vision.<br />I think this movie was more of an experiment by folks who love the Beatles music and have an ideal image of the 1960's, but are living in this modern age of the 21st century.<br />It's visually interesting and musically fun.<br />It's worth checking out.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|For fans of SG-1, this is the perfect end to the Ori story Arc.<br /><br />The visual effects were a notch above the already excellent effects from the show. The effects team gave Morgan le Fay the perfect ethereal look befitting an Ancient. Also the way Adria appeared was beyond perfection.<br /><br />I'm eagerly looking forward to the next DVD installment of the franchise.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series speaks for itself. John Adams is known to many as a \\"Founding Father\\"..yet pales in comparison to those better known such as Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and yes, even John Hancock. This film rights the wrongs history has done to Adams legacy. I defy anyone to watch it and come away with not a better respect for a man whose sense of justice extended to enemies as well as friends. Behold a man who made mistakes, but whose honest simplicity of nature would not allow him to support a lie over a truth. It`s reported that Adams claimed later in his life that no one would build statues and memorials to his name. This film makes the case for doing just that, in honor of a humble man whose oratory skills made the greater case for american independence from Britain, and forming a checks and balances executive, legislative and judicial government, that became the United States of America.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|Great album with two exceptions:     - Remixed version of \\"Name\\" is almost unlistenable. Don't even bother trying to sing along. You'd have better luck at a Counting Crows concert. If they wanted to get this version out they should have at least included the original. Boggles the mind.     - Missing some bona fide radio hits like \\"Long Way Down.\\"     Otherwise this is a solid album. Would have been 5 stars had they included more of their radio hits and put the original \\"Name\\" on the album.

B00133KFGW|4.0|AUGUST RUSH will not go down in history as a profound film: many will even go so far as to dismiss it as kitsch, maudlin, and a simpleton take off on 'Oliver Twist', and other pejoratives. For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief, but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye.<br /><br />Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V. Hart, the premise is that of a fairytale, but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music.  On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and popular Irish guitarist/singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meet on a rooftop, languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms, and that night Lyla becomes pregnant, never to see Louis again, and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort.  Lyla delivers her baby boy, but the child is immediately taken away (Lyla is told the child was stillborn).  'Evan Taylor' AKA August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is placed in an orphanage, longing for parents he believes he can 'hear' in the music of the spheres. Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by  Faginesque Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers.  Renamed August Rush, Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James (Mykelti Williamson) and his girl singer Hope (Jamia Simone Nash) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies (Terrence Howard).  August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park, a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents, both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush, their 'unknown son'. And yes, the ending is a happily ever after one...<br /><br />Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe.  The cast is strong, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the musical score, a very mixed bag, provides a suitable background for the story.  This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events, but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey.

0810993139|5.0|And I haven't even read it yet (but I'll come back and add Mom's thoughts after I do that).  But my son, 10 and in 4th Grade is NOT a reader.  I've tried it all.  Every series, theme, you-name-it it's been put in front of him and he won't read it book.  He's an excellent reader, testing way above his grade, but he doesn't like.to.read.  He picks Calvin & Hobbes and Garfield comics for his at-home reading time.    He mentioned this book because some boys at school like it.  I immediately bought it hoping this would be *the* book.      It was.  He came home today, picked it up out of the package, went upstairs and read the ENTIRE book in one sitting.  All 217 pages.  He then grabbed the second book and attempted to run off and read it (I grabbed it back as we're traveling this weekend and it's for the trip).  This book is beating out the NCAA tournament with him.    Again, I'll be back to provide a real review, but if you're a mom like me, desperately searching for ANY book your son will read, buy it.  You will not regret it!
B000FUF6QS|4.0|I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for ages, so my expectations may had been a bit high. I thought the acting, singing, and atomsphere were great, and it was very unsettling. I hope to get the director's cut, because I know that watching it could turn my like into love. After seeing this movie, I can see why everyone hated the Wickerman remake.
B0012Q94QW|2.0|D'Leh (Strait) and Evolet (Belle) are destined to be together, but are kept apart by clan politics.  Evolet wants to run away with him, byt D'Leh will not because his father left the tribe when he was a child.  His father's act made D'Leh an outcast of sorts, and he has worked hard to restore his name.  When a roving band of warriors raid their village and take most of the tribe, including Evolet, D'Leh makes it his mission to save his people and the woman he loves.<br /><br />At the very least, \\"10,000 B.C.\\" has good special effects.  Not great, but good.  The story itself is nothing special, even silly.  The acting is about the same.  There does not appear to be any factual basis for anything that occurs in the film either.  A key point at the end of the film even elicited an audible groan from me.  There was a time when director Roland Emmerich made movie that were somewhat engaging, but those days seem to be long gone.  My recommendation is to stay away from this film.
0446693804|2.0|Fifty-seven year old Landon Carter remembers his high school senior year, when his life changed forever. Well, this intro may encourage to read on...<br /><br />Landon, a boy from a prominent family living in Beaufort, New Carolina, a son of a politician and grandson of a businessman who made the family fortune, not always acting in a most morally respectable way, needs to get to college. He is an average student, pretty sociable, a nice boy, fond of jokes, but without any special academic or athletic achievements. His parents suggest participating in the drama club, and there he prepares for the Christmas play. The play, traditionally shown every Christmas, has been written by the minister, Hegbert Sullivan, a very religious man, a widower with an only daughter, regarded by the kids as an oddity. His daughter, Jamie, is a quiet girl, wearing drab clothes, who carries her Bible everywhere and lives by its principles. She is always doing good, regularly visits the local orphanage, helps everyone... You get the picture. Sure enough, Landon starts seeing Jamie on a regular basis after joining the drama club and soon falls in love with her. Unfortunately, Jamie has a tragic secret... A lot of drama follows, but the plot is extremely predictable, the writing unremarkable, except for annoying attempts at colloquial speech, as it might have been among teenagers in the 1950s. The only thing I really liked is the description of life and inhabitants of a small, Southern town.<br /><br /> I would say this is a novel directed only at the young adult, it is very naïve and in a very simple and unsubtle way trying to teach good moral values. Not a great literature, rather mediocre. May be enjoyed also by those who like romance. It reads quickly, so it is not a waste of time (can be recommended for airplane reading), but nothing of brilliance either. I guess that the author knows very well how write for the masses and this may be the key to his success.
B000XA5K48|3.0|This movie likes to have its cake and eat it too:    - the anti-gun political message  - along with a celebration of guns and gun violence.     I have noticed this trend in Hollywood. You see it in movies like the Bourne Identity, where 80 minutes of violence and revelling in violence is then followed up by 10 minutes of political \\"message\\". After all, Hollywood wants to make money at the end of the day (and also have a \\"clean conscience\\"). This strategy allows both things to occur: they make money, but then justify it by saying. \\"oh, it was all really against guns\\".
0060755598|3.0|This book has a useful message for businesses in the infancy stage: when someone who is good at something wants to start their own business, they will eventually have to STOP doing what they are good at and start building a business -- a very different skill set. I give the book four or five stars for the principles to be gleaned (though I do have some qualms about his insistence on hiring barely adequate people, not the best people, which seems to be in contradiction to \\"Good to Great,\\" which emphasizes the importance of quality workers doing what they do best).    However, the unabridged version has SO much padding in it, it became grating fairly quickly. Gerber could probably have said what he needed to say over the course of two CDs, not seven. He runs on and on, beating his points to death. I found myself skipping ahead quite a bit. Since it's an audio CD, I might have missed something useful, but I couldn't take the pedantic, overkill I was being subjected to. A typical example: \\"Jim and Bob own a business together. Sometimes Jim does the books. Sometimes Bob does the books. When Jim doesn't do the books, Bob does. When Bob doesn't do the books, Jim does. When they hired Al, either Bob, Jim, or Al did the books. When Bob or Jim didn't do the books, Al did. When Al or Bob didn't do the books, Jim did.\\" And so on and so forth. It was either skip ahead or crash my car into a wall to end the mental anguish this style of speaking/writing caused.     So, useful info mixed into the dregs. I recommend the abridged version.
B000002UAU|3.0|First off, let me say I AM a Beatles fan. I have owned everything they've ever released in one form or another, and a great number of solo releases   as well. So, this review is not coming from a Beatles hater or a casual fan. Sgt. Pepper is, in my opinon, the most over rated Beatles album they released. It has worn thin over the years. I can listen to Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, Revolver, or even Magical Mystery tour and never think \\"What's the Deal?\\" Not so with Sgt. Pepper. There are good songs, to be sure, but the overall effect is one of a band trying too hard to be different from thier previous albums. There were better albums released in 1967, including one by the Beatles themselves. Magical mystery tour, to be exact. At this point, I think the band was not acting like a band as much as a group of muscians trying not to SOUND like a band. I understand that the concept was to be SGT. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and not the Beatles. I get it. I just don't get why this album, more than any other Beatles release has endured. People go ga ga over this album in ways I just don't get. Sgt. Pepper didn't change popular music. \\"Please Please Me\\" did, and every Beatles album after that.  Pepper is over-rated. It's not their best work. That disticntion should go to Rubber Soul or Abbey Road.

I liked the drawings and the stories made me laugh out loud.  I made my Mom read part of the book out loud to my class on guest reader day at school.  She got into a little trouble for using the word \\"moron\\" in class.      I can't wait to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2- Roderick Rules.                                                          - Ryan Goepfrich
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is a wonderful title to pick up on Blu-ray.  Some of the scenes are breath-taking and others are great.      Aside from the picture quality, it's very interesting in it's content.  You won't be disappointed.
B00008RWRH|4.0|Contrary to almost all the reviewers I don't care nearly so much for this set. I'm especially surprised someone would give up the Davis set for this one. Late Jochum seems to produce some divided opinions, his style later in his career generally running to less dramatic, suaver performances.<br /><br />Haydn is a very challenging composer - most conductors only discover after a recording session how extremely difficult it is to completely capture a satisfactory reading of any his mature works. The works seem to play themselves, and then you look back and realize how much didn't come out. You might have gone any number of ways at this, that or another point in the score. As one noted podium hustler quipped to me, after his up-beat sunny reading of Haydn's Drum Roll, \\"Yeah, but I could also have done it tragic - it's more bloody complicated than Mahler.\\"<br /><br />  I find it interesting so many reviewers were so ecstatic about these very pleasant and essentially genteel performances. Certainly even the earliest and to my taste the most powerful recordings in this set, such as 88, do not rise to the level of a Furtwangler or a Scherchen. Nor do I hear the invigorating readings others do, certainly not in direct comparison to those conductors who I do find invigorating in these works. Jochum never achieves the sort of electric energy and crispness found in the Cleveland Orchestra under Szell, the searching imagination of Scherchen, which despite a plethora of orchestra issues remains a benchmark, or even the easy knowing informality of Beecham.<br /><br />Frankly I prefer listening to the rarely discussed von Karajan set, which has it perversities, but also sports some new and provocative ways of looking at Haydn.<br /><br />Readers should understand in referring them instead to the Davis Philips set of Haydn's London Symphonies over this one I am decidely NOT a Colin Davis fan. I panned his most recent Beethoven set. However, for the moment I still think his Philips set remains the best overall of the large orchestra versions available.

The Woldike set, reissued on Vanguard Classics, remains one of the handsomest all around interpretations with superb woodwinds, excellent grand overall pacing, a full bracing momentum, and lovely early stereo. It's only shortcoming is a tendency to downplay the wit and humor, vital features in Haydn, even in his grandest symphonies.

Right now that laurel goes to the Colin Davis set. However, it can be bettered, and I look forward to the competition among the younger set when they grow tired of playing around with Mahler and Bruckner and move up to Haydn.of the large orchestra versions available.

B000M4RG42|3.0|I wasn't blown away by this film.  I thought it could have used some editing in places, no stand-out acting for me, served its purpose & told its story.  I was kind of distracted by how goody-goody the main character was, starts feeling too cliche & wondered how that set with the descendants of the other less-than-valiant service members that hoisted the flag or from that company.  On the other hand, I'm happy to watch any film made about this war & the sacrifices made.  Definitely pulled my heartstrings & the checkbook to send a little something off to the Veterans.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|Been generally enjoying watching this on DVD; after a while the fast, smartie-pants repartee gets old, but it's still interesting to see how this buddy-buddy theory of raising a kid will work out. The mom isn't a great example to her kid, with her sleeping around, but this is TV. In one episode, however, the liberal bent lurking in the background comes to the fore in a nasty way - for no reason, the mom screams that she hates George Bush. And why? Because of the way he looks! Classic liberal hypocrisy - attacking someone because he looks weird to you, or because he doesn't agree with your views, yet denouncing \\"lookism\\". (And you just KNOW she has a bumper sticker that says \\"Hatred is not a family value.\\") This peeled back the cheery veneer of the show for me, although you knew it already from the joy-hating Korean Christian mom character.<br /><br />So, still fun enough to watch, but slightly sanctimonious.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I saw this on a flight from Newark to Taiwan, and laughed and laughed and laughed.  It starts out kind of slow, but builds into sheer hilarity.  When my seatmate awoke and searched for a movie, I recommended it to him, and took pleasure in watching him laugh.  More recently, I recommended it to my seatmate on a flight from New Delhi to Vienna, and she, too, howled.  Then, I recommended it to friends, and they ALL reported back that they had the best laugh in years:\\"After you guys recommended it, I rented it for M and me.  Best laugh in a long time (over a movie, anyway).\\"  And, \\" Oh, if you really want a great laugh from a movie, rent \\"Death at a Funeral\\". British movie, just absolutely hilarious. K fell off the couch twice and T spit out his water a few times. Can't remember the last time that I got a true belly laugh from a movie.\\"  BUY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!
B000XCZGVI|5.0|I saw the film when it was released because I wanted to see David Fincher's treatment of the story and was impressed. I was a teenager at the time and remember the case very well. He handled it very deftly and paid respect to victims and law enforcement. He handled the material with sensitivity but was direct in telling the story.  This is an excellent film on one of the most baffling cold cases in the US during the last century. I remember the news reports and Fincher's film conveys the era and the fear that the Zodiac spread throughout northern California. It also focuses on the impact the case had on all involved and the toll it took on the lives it touched. More than other crime films, it shows the amount of work the case took from several police departments because of the multiple jurisdictions and this case had to be handled along with full case loads of other crimes the detectives and officers had to work. In addition, each jurisdiction contended with issues on cooperation, lack of funds, and lack of manpower. I came away with a real appreciation for the integrity of the officers involved and a respect for how much effort the reporters, the detectives, and officers put into the case.  Fincher paid a great deal attention to detail, including recreating victims' clothes and, when possible, using real locations. He also had an impressive list of advisors, including Detective Toschi, Bryan Hartnell, and Robert Graysmith, which helped lend the authenticity to the filmed account.  I recommend the two-disc set with the interviews with Bryan Hartnell and Mike Mageau, survivors of the Lake Berryessa and Blue Rock Springs attacks, and the surviving detectives and officers that investigated the case.

B000002897|5.0|This was no unknown band nor album when it was released, but through the years it got covered with a layer of dust. The song \\"I nearly lost\\" got stuck in my head and I still could remember the lyrics a decade after I heard the song for the last time.<br /><br />When I tried to find the music, it proved very difficult. Apparently after this period the music gained an audience once more and this time the music has a timelessness character. No matter what people want to call it, it's good crafted music with fine lyrics. The first time you listen to it, it will strike your soul, guaranteed!
0307387178|5.0|I have read and watched the film.  Its a very good book and film for adventures and when your on the road you can meet so many amazing people and you dont have to have money and be rich to be happy.  And that my friends is what Chris was getting at.  He wanted to experience life simply for what it was, and enjoy the air and natural beauty around him. Because in our society its busy and full of arogant people.  I understand why he did it.  And he found and made peace within his self.  And thats what he needed to do.
B00006I53S|4.0|I really like this lens.  No, it's not the high end \\"L\\" series (professional quality), but it takes bright razor sharp images.  It's also lightweight which is a plus when the camera is as heavy as the Canon 5D.  To be honest, I'm going to sell my lens to get one of the pro series models, but that's because I'm a professional photographer.  This lens should be perfect for 99% of all photographers.
1594489505|5.0|This books deserves more than 5 stars.  If you liked The Kite Runner, you will love this book.  The story is very compelling, disturbing and sad.  It gave me a much deeper appreciation for being an American citizen and for the many freedoms I have always enjoyed.  What the 2 main characters go thru is something we cannot even begin to imagine.  This book is not for wimps, as the violence is quite graphic.  IMHO.  I read it in less than 2 days before giving it to my husband.  I can guarantee you will need a box of tissues.  Get comfortable, and forget about sleeping.  You will not want to put it down.
B00018D3JQ|5.0|Imagine a long summernight, when you're sitting outside having a relaxed cooldown after a long, hot day. This music is the perfect companion, just as the original songs were for a cold winternight in a northern town. Some songs are almost unrecognizable from their original recording, so even though you might have listened to these way to often in the 80s, they are still refreshing the way Nouvelle Vague has remastered them.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|...De-Loused was an epic and proggy psycadelic album...if somewhat a little too acessible...now after this what would Omar and Cedric and co. think of next? Well now we have Frances the Mute...an album with only 5 real songs inside it (they've been divided very awkwardly but the tracks are very obvious)...now the differences in this album are quite obvious...do you remember the instrumental part in cicitraz esp? (you know...bird noises) well lets just say there are ALOT more of these and significantly longer to the point that most people would be able to leave the room and come back and it would still be going...there is also alot more of noticable latin influence with Cedric at times speaking in Spanish...but of course...like most of Mars Voltas work it has to be heard to understand...hypocritically speaking here's a track listing...    Cygnus Vismond Cygnus 10/10: Starts off with an accoustic guitar and a quiet cedric singing in the background then suddenly the drum and pounding bass comes crashing in with Cedric sounding like a banshee (unsure what language) and then a quick guitar solo vocal break followed by the sound again...after this is repeated a few times there is then a gradual and rather long instrumental part until the vocals come back in with the chorus...then it breaks down into very awkward noises...for quite a long time...    Widow 7/10: Yes...the single...never liked it that much...verse chorus combo...a trumpet solo then a guitar solo...not the best song really...a load of noise leads to the next song...    L'viaquez (forgotten how to spell it) 9/10: Starts with a light thudding of the drum until appearing with an amazing intro solo followed by a light hearted salsa vibe from Cedrics spanish lyrics...which is usually not my kind of music but it compliments it very well...the chorus is alot more quieter and sinister and follows a simple pattern of exploding back into full blast when the verse comes back with a guitar solo...after this is repeated afew times there is then a part which doesn't follow the old structure...slightly interesting but nothing new...feels kind of rushed...and then ends with a slowed down version of Cedrics vocals into...    Miranda that ghost just isn't holy anymore 10/10: Now if I was to also mark it for the large blank sound at the beginning...I would probably have to deduct a mark because no one should have to be this patient voluntarily (or just fast forward who knows) but what follows is so fragile and beautiful...cedric really does sing falsetto at this point and to such a point it could make you cry (in a good way)...and the chorus...sends shivers down the spine...it is so beautifully eerie...trumpets are also good...    Cassandra Gemini 10/10: I really don't care what people say about this song being pointlessly long...I love it...it starts off very active and insane...with loads of sound flying everywhere...and then they get more structured...then there's a very long part where there's just a drone of instrumentation until they come back again...it then ends as the album started with the accoustic guitars and cedric sounding slightly more insane then he did to begin...    ...if you liked Mars Volta for De-Loused...this may take some getting used to...but trust me once it grows on you...you will reap the reward from the muted unenlightened (aka anyone who hasn't heard this)...
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Certainly directors are given various freedoms to interpret their own idea of a story, and come up with a new creation for a classic. We've seen it done over and over again. But, for those who love the story the way it was intended, it seems silly to ruin it, unless it is for a compelling purpose, none of which was here in Beowulf. Imagine going to see your favorite band and having them singing your favorite song a completely different way, with different lyrics, and then still maintain it was the same song. This is what it is like to sit through the \\"Hollywoodized\\"  film version of Beowulf. I'm a purest in some respects, but can put up with some reasonable additions and deletions and adjustments for particular works--consider the newer version of Great Expectations, as an example. Still, I think that the basic idea of this film was doomed from the start. It would have been better off had this movie not been called Beowulf.     Probably what irks me most about this film is Zemeckis' idea that the poem was \\"boring\\" and that \\"he didn't understand it\\", something he refers to in the making of Beowulf in the extras.  I don't understand the motivation to make a film version of a book when you have little interest in the book. He did say he found interest in the screenplay version, but that seemingly kills the integrity of the story. Like one reviewer said, he had no business making this film. His disregard for the real story is evident when Beowulf goes to meet (ahem... kill) Grendel's mother, for example. It just seems ludicrous for him to have even been involved, especially when the potential to make a good movie was there.     And, don't get me wrong. This film did have some good qualities. Although Beowulf is a vastly different character in the film, there are moments where he does carry on a heroic and noble persona.  There are intense moments in battle, and the special effects are quite amazing in many respects. Cool effects can only go so far, though.     Over all,this was a film with a lot of potential that sold out to make money or please \\"eye candy\\" enthusiasts. It winds up being just another one of the many dumbed-down versions of a story. Zemeckis went a little too far with his freedom of interpretation. Well, here's my interpretation of his story: it's mediocre.     2 1/2 stars
B000UYX4OK|2.0|After enjoying so much action and effects on the new animation film with Hopkins and Angelina..this one falls short of almost everything...good acting but a lack of depth and budget make this one a rental at the most.
B00005JPTK|2.0|Ok, I saw the trailer for this way back and I thought it looked pretty good. After seeing it, I was anything but thrilled. The story resembles the classic Omega Man of the early 1970s with Charlton Heston. Though in general I do like Will Smith, I found a number of his block buster films busted, and this is no exception. Nevertheless, the film did have some good moments and even had moments of intense drama. I am glad I didn't pay the over priced movie ticket cost to see this film, but I'm sure it will be fun to watch on FX or AMC channel. Anyway, rent it don't buy it. Sorry Will.
B000O1799U|3.0|I was rather disappointed upon watching this movie.<br /><br />I merely gave it 3 stars for the singing, which was wonderful! Beyonce and Jennifer were spectacular. However, I don't think that the movie lived up to all of the hype that was made over it. Through the movie I tried to get into it, but I just never could... the movie just seemed to be very boring.
0452287588|5.0|I ordered Eckhart Tolles' book used, which came to me like new. Would never have known it was used. Price was very fair, and I received item before I expected. I am 100per cent pleased with this transaction. I would also recommend this book for anyone that wants to improve upon their life. Thankyou.
B001041JLE|5.0|I think is an excelent disk and a good stuff to colect, because the time has assure to michael jackson and his production a space in the world of music.<br /><br />i think have to bring some other videos on the dvd.
0385338724|2.0|Pretty blah...character-wise, plot-wise, literary-wise and romance-wise. This book did not work for me because it lacked emotional intensity, it read really slow, and I found I just couldn't connect with the characters at all. I added a second star because I loved the part about the sunflowers, but other than that, this book added nothing to my life. Do NOT recommend.
B000069HZP|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! Nick VanOrton/Michael Douglas shouldve gotten an oscar/high acclaim in this performance. Adventure/Drama/Mystery/Suspense is what you will get from Michael Douglas (an invesment banker/millionaire) running through the streets of San Francisco in a tailored suit and $2,000 shoes with a blonde who confesses that she aint wearing panties while being stuck in the elevator with Nick. Well Nick who is beginning to realize and experience his gift from his bro, connie (Sean Penn)a \\"GAME\\" ...which he obviuosly is not too fond off to the point where towards the end of the movie he jumps off a building...watch this movie!
0765318741|5.0|\\"If one vampire was scary, a world filled with them would be really scary.\\"  This is what Richard Matheson himself said in an interview about his book \\"I Am Legend.\\"  He takes the stuff of fantasy and brings it to light once again.  These days we can hear the word \\"vampire\\" and dismiss it as magic phenomena during an age of ignorance.  But Matheson does away with the medieval whimsy and applies (albeit crude) science to the legend.  And what do we get?  Something that could be possible in the land of reason.  The dark, hidden fears that we humans have pushed to the back of our minds can resurface somewhat when the magic is explained in a way that makes the logical mind pause and consider.  Matheson's repackaging of these ancient, inborn fears seems to have lent a hand in its continued fascination and popularity many years after it's first publication.<br /><br />In the book, we follow Robert Neville as he goes through the phases of forced solitude and loneliness.  He treads the precarious line between sanity and insanity as he tries to re-establish himself in this new world he finds himself in.  As the last man on earth, what is his purpose?  Where can he belong?  To keep from going mad he fights (physically and mentally) to find a reason to continue living.  It's not until the very end that he finds out what his new place has become.
B000UJCALI|5.0|I saw this once when it first came out and when my kids wanted to watch a good horror movie I couldn't find something with PG or PG13 rating.  Then I remembered this movie.  I got it and it delivers.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|If you think George W. just may be the Antichrist, that your phone could be tapped, or you just don't trust the government all that much then this is the movie for you!    Seriously, it is a really good movie in the same social commentary view as The Matrix. Basically, it boils down to free yourself and rid the world of oppressive controls.     If that does not sound like your cup of tea, well then you can see some of the other reviewers opinions on it.    best line: \\"The people should not fear its government, the government should fear its people.\\"
B00005JPTK|5.0|i love this movie , i think it is one of  Will Smith's Greatest Presentations of his whole Career , The two Disc is well worth it just for the extra 4 minute alternate ending , i hated the movie for how it ended in theateres but love the alternate and wish that was what they released it with but now i have both versions to enjoy....
B00000K19E|5.0|Being an occultist I use The Matrix to explain magical concepts to people just getting into magic or questioning religion, society, or the mind. It is a profound metaphor for what humanity *is* and what we can be. The action in it has of course changed movie making for years to come, but really the action is there in my opinion to get the message out to the masses. If you think this view is a little off just think of it this way. The Matrix, Agents and the machines are all analogies of societies/religions/cultures programming on the human mind and how they keep us under control. If one frees himself of this programming from both the outward matrix and the controls within (Agents) then one becomes \\"free\\" to change the world as they see fit.    As for the sequels, they were not needed. OK, but ultimately cheapened the first.
B0000640VO|5.0|Many have called this one of the top 10 greatest movies of all time.  Well, I was skeptical but have become a convert. Amazing cinematography; fabulous casting and characters; a feel-good-warm-your-heart movie; a romance; a comedy - all wrapped into one foreign sub-titled film running two hours but at a hectic / mesmerizing pace.     Amelie, who works as a waitress, takes pleasure in the small things in life (smooth stones, skipping rocks on water, kindness).  She manages to orchestrate several feel good solutions for the lives of her friends and family.  And, then she falls in love but can't bring her introverted self to let him know how she feels.  As they say, one good turn deserves another and one of her friends helps her cross the chasm.  A must-see movie.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone to read!  I have read thid book twice and never got bored reading it the second time around.  Marion Zimmer BRadley has an amazing talent of holding your attention to the book from the begining to the very end.  The first time I read this book, I became so attached, as if I was personally involved in the lives of the characters.  This book stayed with me long after I read it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MQC9H4 The Holiday]]    A must see for anyone who has loved and lost, is seeking Mr/Mrs Right, or whom appreciates and values meaningful relationships with people of all ages and backgrounds. This uplifting movie celebrates the ups and downs of life, the nurturing of friendships and children, taking care of our elders and learning how to be strong yet giving.  I bought 2 copies; one for a friend at Valentines Day so that I could share with her the joy (and hope for mankind) that this movie brought me....and there is even a comedic bit with a dog.....you'll watch it over and over again.
B000ZN8036|1.0|The book was fascinating but this movie is flat, pretentious, and boring. The movie's presentation of the behavior of this very ill young man, and his cruelty to his family, as some type of noble hippie \\"quest\\" is warmed over 60's drivel.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|The palette this series uses to paint emotive, empathic, and richly textured profiles of real problems with people has an alluring and self-therapeutic effect. This sounds cheesy, but after a few episodes you grow and feel a kinship with the characters.     I don't know how to describe how amazingly real this series is.  As someone's not only studied therapy and psychology academically, but who has also been \\"in treatment\\" for over 100 hours, this is the closest thing to real thing.  Byrne is exceptional.  Wise, smooth, suave, composed, compassiaonte, and real.  His supporting cast (the patients) are equally captivating.
B000QXDE6I|4.0|I'm glad this album has been re-released after 20+ years. Alcatrazz was an underrated band from the mid-80's that featured the fine talents of ex-Rainbow lead singer Graham Bonnet and guitarist Steve Vai. While the synthesizer work makes the album sound slightly dated, Bonnet's distinctive vocal style, Vai's guitar work, and the catchy melodies make this an album to remember.<br /><br />Hearing this album again really brought back memories from high school. I hope a new generation of listeners discovers this (mostly) overlooked gem.
B0011HOEYY|4.0|This film is quite good, a few scenes that make you go ooooohh, god, please take that out but overall very enjoyable. A should see, not a must see, but a great film if you love the seventies.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased this for a double stroller that has no drink caddy/top compartment. I was able to strap it to one side, realistically I could put two on but I don't really need two. Great product.
B0010358D0|3.0|This second installment of Appleseed is a pale shadow of the first movie.  The story is nowhere near as engaging. The animation is second rate at best compared to the first. At least in the first one the voices sync with the animation pretty well, not so in this one. I give it 3 stars only as a gift.
0143034901|5.0|Spanish and South American writers know how to get me hynpnotized reading their books. You just take your eyes off the book and discover you were just living the pages of another world like you have never imagined before. It's like booking a ticket to a great attraction in an amusment park. Once you get off, you still want more of it.<br />Calros Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of the Wind is about laughter, horror, mystery, love, a lovely bookshelf, a mysterious city, Julian Carax, an interesting childhood, secrets. It's about everything. Still there is always some underlined danger lurking in the corner of the pages. Something that keeps you reading and reading.<br />This is a masterpieace by all means, and in fact for all kinds of book lovers.<br />I know a lot of other reviewers spoiled the story already, but guess what? This book is so good that it can't be spoiled, and it can't be told. You are going to have to experience it.<br />For those of you who have not read it, this is highly reccomended. For those who have, please tell me what other Zafon books are available in English.<br />Five Stars
0060005696|4.0|As I write this review, I am pondering what I should do next: read, watch tv, do homework, look info up on google, or play euchre.<br /><br />I'll probably read. What book? I have a stack of fifty that I will probably never get through. What is worse, it takes me more time to choose the book I would like to read than it does to read it!<br /><br />This is what the Paradox of Choice is all about. We think our lives are great. We have more stuff, more options, more channels, and more choice than ever. Yet, people do not seem to be any happier than they were in the days of barbarism, i.e., before TV had 200 channels and the internet was a necessity.<br />If anything, we are more stressed, anxious, uncertain, and depressed than ever.<br /><br />Hence the paradox.<br />Shwartz marshals hundreds of studies to explain this paradox. The main conclusion is that humans are usually maximizers. This means we try to get the absolute best deal we can (whether it be in the mating market or the supermarket). However, this attitude also leads to guilt and stress. You begin to think: Did I chose the right mate? The right book? The right car? The grass looks greener, and there is more of it than there ever has been before.<br /><br />This book explained my everyday life in a way that few books have. I wish that it would have focused on existential issues in more detail, rather than catering to marketers and economists. Whatever. It is still an excellent, non-technical account of the paradox of choice.<br /><br />For those who love the book, I would recommend reading more technical works by Kahneman and Tversky. Their work is essential for understanding the heuristics of human decision making.<br /><br />Of course, there are a million other things you could do, so why would you choose to do that!
0743298039|5.0|Our book group generally reads a more serious genre, leaning toward intellectual stimulation.  The upshot for this novel?  Lots of laughter and questions and lively discussion.  Always a few that don't like this sort of reading but most of us welcomed this as a great dessert.    Well written, involving, almost immediately interesting and clues hit you in the face and you never guess it for a minute.  Everything comes full circle.  C'mon.  Don't be a book snob.  Enjoy this for what it is.  Go for it.  It wasn't on the best seller list for nothing!
B0012K1ILW|3.0|For Badu fans, you will either love or hate this CD. You know Erykah is off the chain with her political and religious views, and definitely ecletic when it comes to the sounds of her music. If you love it, than you may be down with some of her expressions of black powerness and her chanting to different gods. On the other hand, if you hate it it can be for those same reasons. The majority of the CD seems like she's meditating and you may feel up to joining in or you may not. The end of the CD with \\"Honey\\" doesn't go along with the proceeding songs and seems more like a prelude of what's to come on the next CD perhaps.<br /><br />Erykah is dancing to the beat of her own drum on this one, and either you are going to dance with her or unplug the CD.
0060922583|5.0|I am now reading the book for the third time and it is just as amazing as the first. It is full of scientific facts and a few personal stories. Talbot remains blessedly neutral presenting information on almost any area of the human experience you can imagine. As a minister I found the scientific information on miracles somehow did not lower my faith but showed me that the concepts people of faith have held, (miracles, prayer changing things, metaphysical principles, etc.) actually have some scientific reality underlying them. I often find myself writing a whole sermon just on the concept presented in one paragraph.
B000P12LWY|2.0|Watch out.  The version of the DVD I bought has 2 copies of episode 8 - and  no copy of episode 9.  Since episode 9 is fairly critical, that's a downer.
B000YXMMAO|4.0|Just trying to be helpful:    I got a copy (new) from another vendor in Atlanta, and the pressing is flawless. I've had this happen with several other new records, and it appears that it is a question of what batch the record came from. I had a new REM that was bad, purchased in San Francisco, then Athens, GA, then Atlanta. The first two had the same weird problem, and the third was perfect.    Naturally you can't tell this in any way other than by buying it, but be aware that there are great pressings of this record around. Maybe Amazon got a bad batch.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Actually I had DVD version before I bought this Blue Ray version<br />My son is crazy about this movie, so I add my collection by buying this Blu Ray \\"Cars\\"<br />And then,..... Just shock with the pictures quality, stunning.....wonderfull. Very very reccomend to have this !!!!<br />Story is nice too, teach us a good thing, watch the attitude shifting of McQueen, it is good for our Boy and Girl.....
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I found buying through Amazon is very convenient and trustworthy. This is my first purchase and looking forward to do the same in future.
B0011FXLCC|3.0|If you threw Supernature and Felt Mountain into a boiling cauldron, you'd get Seventh Tree.  This recipe has made for a very bland album, unfortunately (2.5 stars, but they get an extra .5 for their previous work and their YouTube Christmas caroling efforts).
B00005JPTK|1.0|I had great expectations from this movie especially after the success at the box office. After watching it I was totally disappointed. The movie has no action and the story is lame at best, Smith performance is so-so.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I'll make this short but \\"New Ameryah\\" is an album that the music industry NEEDS right now, especially with this being a political year. R&B was hanging by a thread--seriously--and I'm glad Erykah's back to rejuvenate music. We find a very different Erykah on this album, which is dark, murky, political, psychedelic, beautiful. The music's off-kilter and speaks volumes of what has been going on for ages (drugs, poverty, depression, politics). But it works. And the songs flow nicely together. Most won't get it on the first listen and might be challenged to keep up with Erykah's creative pulses. But if you wrap your mind around it, then you'll get it. I'm finding that the people that are most disappointed are the ones that expected that \\"Mama's Gun\\" feel. But real artists change and the fans should let them. Badu has artistically grown and this is a very nice progression. She's speaking a lot of TRUTH on this substantial album. Can't wait for Part two in July and the Edith Funker project later this year.     Highlights: Amerykah Promise, Me, Soldier, The Cell, Twinkle, Master Teacher, That Hump, Telephone
B000001GQJ|5.0|With Argerich you simply cannot go wrong in the world of piano.<br />There is so much passion, near recklessness and sheer power to rival even Liszt himself.<br />The Scherzo is so clean and maintains an unmatched pace throughout - yet be not deceived as some uncredibly sweet moments will catch you unaware.<br />The Toccata is truly devilish and one cannot comprehend how a human could reach such a tempo and yet hit all the required notes!!<br />The Jeux d'eau makes one wonder who might posesse all these pianistic abilities; from dreamy images to listless moments where languor is at hand, from the most fluid and yes, watery splashes to crystal clear melodies!<br />Finally, if for no other reason, you must have this Liszt Sonata!  I have never heard any pianist come close to this playing, none maintains such a tempo, such focus and huge dynamic changes.  This is Liszt at his most brilliant and daring yet also in hushed tones offering glimpses of his human and vulnerable side.  The changes in tonality and hushed passages prove that Argerich is so much more than speed or power - she exudes pure musicality!<br />This must rate as my all-time favorite CD!
074356619X|4.0|I think the low percentage of people who did not like this book need to give it another chance.  I know it sounds far fetched but it you commit to it, it really does improve your life.  It is not always easy to understand and because it is getting a lot of hype, people are disregarding it but it makes life easier when you are not so stressed about everything.  Consider the DVD also.  It often makes the message a little more clear...
B0010358CQ|4.0|This movie was good but its characters looked a bit rubbery they should stick with orginal artwork and it arrived a week early
0399230033|1.0|I ordered two copies of this book based on all the positive reviews (one as a gift and one for my 9 month old), they are both being sent back. We have a collection of great board books this one is not worthy among them and it is not good enough to be given as a gift. I can't understand how people rave about this book, the text is boring and unimaginative, the art is not very good and the overall feeling of animals in cages does not make for pleasant dreams ( the animals do end up back in their cages for the night!). There are tons of other great books in this range keep looking... We ordered Time For Bed by Mem Fox and it has light years more character and charm.   For the record I don't spend my time knocking children's books. If people are going to pay good money for something they have a right to know peoples opinions.  I admit the gorilla and mouse are kind of cute...but not cute enough for us.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I am a big fan of the show and when the show ended I felt that we where left with many unanswered questions.  This movie is really well made and answered some of the big questions.  I purchased this movie to show my support for the show and with hopes that scifi or some other network can see that this is a great show with a lot life left in it.
B000002GB4|4.0|I have ordered from Amazon many time and will always come here first for any requests.  I have friends that contact me to find what they are looking for.  Thank You from all of us, for having and delivering on time and notifying when shippment has been made.
0312360266|4.0|This book is totally not for young teens at all.  It deals with swearing and sexual issues.  My only real problem with this book is the author trying to be \\"hip and cool\\" by adding things in parenthesis.  I realize that Kristin Cast is young and involved in the writing but I think that the \\"teen touch\\" was a little contrived.  Like the book will say something like \\"I like boys who are tall, dangerous and handsome (like Vin Diesel).\\"  first of all I don't know any teens who think Vin Diesel is tall or handsome...I guess maybe dangerous is a possibility.  The other thing is that instead of swearing, our leading lady says things like Poopie\\" multiple times.  It's kinda lame....no one would say that!<br /><br />Given those things, I really liked the story a lot especially after it got going a little.  It is interesting and well thought out.  It is easy to skip over the writing in parenthesis totally and there is less written in this way towards the end of the book.  I love the characters and even the secondary characters.  Everyone is very well thought out.  I am pretty impressed.  Without the silly \\"teen speak\\" I would have given it 5 stars!
B000001E18|5.0|Zooropa can easily be seen as a natural progression in the band's musical evolution as rockers, social commentators and human beings, when examined through a religious and prog-rock grid.     actually, the heavily synthesized sound of this album is entirely appropriate because of its predominating subject matter, the alienation of modern man as a result of gross consumerism, technological dependence and moral declination.    there is also an interesting, yet subtle tension throughout many of the songs, a cry for both a natural balance in the world (and the self) and supernatural intervention; both of which have been upset or largely ignored on the surface.      musically, Zooropa offers many traditional blues-influenced ballads with the band's usual instrumentation while Brian Eno assists with a heavily syhthesized-yet-innovative sound that often chills and refuses to soothe.    the cd book inside is heavily colored and assaults the viewer with disturbing images distorted by a computer-imaging software program, and easily supports the theme of the overarching theme of the album.       one of my favorite U2 albums, this is a must-have album for fans of U2 and Brian Eno, but they may not know it yet...
B00005JPTK|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent special effects.<br />*Excellent, imaginative, vivid settings and imagery.<br />*Pretty good, interesting main character.<br />*Pretty good story, portrayed in an interesting way.<br />*Good suspense in some parts.<br />*Good drama.<br />*Strong themes about men messing with nature.<br />*Strong themes about fate.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*It's short, and seems like there could have been more.  In particular, the main character never develops a strong relationship with the survivors he encounters.<br />*Not much action.<br />*I can't help but to notice that the mutant zombies look fake.  They're like a cross between \\"LOTR\\"'s Gollum and \\"The Mummy\\"'s Imhotep.  Thus, they are not very menacing.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor \\"Omega Man,\\" this film has much less action, and focuses more on drama, suspense, characters, and themes.  But even if it is slow-moving, the imagery is great, the film is well-made (even if the camera shakes a little), and has some strong, interesting themes and ideas.  It could almost be considered artistic and deep.  I think it surpasses most other monster/zombie/sci-fi movies, and would reccomend at least renting it.
0307346617|4.0|I'm a long-time zombie fan(atic) who is always on the lookout for a fresh new spin on the classic scenarios rendered most memorably by George A. Romero. In spite of the super cheesy acting (perhaps I should say: \\"partly because of...\\"), Day of the Dead is my favorite of the bunch.     Many novels and short story collections have come out over the years that attempt to find new perspectives and/or alterations to the original ideas. We've been all over the map, from God's Wrath to Human Stupidity (i.e., toxic/nuclear waste, outbreak of Government-engineered virus, etc...), Alien Origin, and so on. But the genre has in many ways been riddled with problems, mostly the result of Good Storyline/Bad Writing or vice versa.     Max Brooks takes the basic storyline without much modification and applies solid writing to it. Personally, I prefer the basic approach with regard to zombie story traditions, so no complaints in that area. Running zombies are ok, but there's something really cool about just slowly dragging a foot behind you and moaning (I do this every morning before hitting the shower, so there's a special affinity here). The writing is engaging and skillful - no rambling, excessive sidebars, or other annoyances. It's straight-forward storytelling, wrapped up in a series of interviews of those who survived the war. Many different viewpoints are expressed, from soldiers who fought on the front lines, to scared kids, to radio operators who broadcasted survival tips. It gives a good cross-section of experiences that simply cannot be represented in stories focusing only on individuals or small groups.     But this also brings me to my only complaint. I think the style employed by Brooks is a nice way of seeing the big picture in such a war. However, there is something lost in this mode of storytelling: emotion. It's more difficult to get invested in a character when you only know them for 3-5 pages. Not to mention that you're hearing about it all after the fact, so it'sobvious that they survived...and when you read about their trials and tribulations, there's no real tension/uncertainty involved.     In the end, that's just a little quibble on my part. The bottom line is that this book is one of the best in the zombie genre, in my opinion.
0440238609|5.0|I love the fantasy genre; the problem is, the majority of books found under this genre lack depth.  After reading several reviews of the Golden Compass, I decided to take a chance.  Not only did I find that the storyline moves in a straightforward manner, it also contains depth - issues related to religion, social hierarchies, prejudice, stereotypes, social mores, the quest for power - and the ways to maintain it, and coming of age - to name just a few.  These nuances are beautifully woven into the storyline; they don't browbeat.  Consequently, if you only read the \\"surface\\" of the story, this is for you; yet, if you're a reader who looks at the underlying pinnings of a story - this story is also for you.
0979660742|5.0|This is in my opinion the best, most straight-forward book on grammar and style. I accidentally ordered the original, which doesn't contain White's contributions. This version weighs in at 52 pages and delivers relevant advice on every one of them. There are longer, more detailed studies out there, of course. But if you want to do more writing and less thumbing through a rulebook, this is an excellent solution. Highly recommended!
B000ZN258W|5.0|I LOVE Nick Cave.      Like the previous reviewer pointed out, this sounds more like a better, more polished sequel to Cave's GRINDERMAN album... so if you're looking for a AND NO MORE SHALL WE PART or BOATMAN'S CALL - type album, you're out of luck.  But don't dismiss this album, though... it's got some great cuts that are destined to become more Cave classics.      For the past decade, I've had to order Cave's albums from overseas, since America doesn't get his albums until way, way later than their initial release.  I highly recommend getting this version... the 60-page booklet is nothing more but the complete lyrics to each song, but it's a great little companion piece.
6305657947|4.0|There are two things worth noticing about this movie. One is the writing of Leslie Dixon who makes the cat-and-cat love affair simmer in spite of its gross improbability. The other is the absolute dominance of Rene Russo, a creature so gorgeous that one has to be amazed that she can also speak. Of course, when she speaks, the energy (in this otherwise fairly silly film) just about melts the screen.<br />There are people who insist that the other lead lends some interest to the sexual tension. They're wrong.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of the beautiful [[ASIN:1601640005 bang BANG: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:0131186361 New Short Course in Wine,The]]

B000RHKARY|5.0|Its about time that this important early John Mayall recording has finally been remastered and re-released. Legions of Mayall fans who own the original on well-worn vinyl should be thrilled as should younger Mayall fans who will hear some of the most important people in the history of blues rock playing as a unit. The original Crusade features such luminaries as Mick Taylor, John McVie, and Keef Hartley while the bonus tracks portion features such soon-to-be-famous personages as Mick Fleetwood, Peter Green and Aynsley Dunbar.  My favorite cuts on the original are: the powerful Oh Pretty Woman; Stand Back Baby; My Time After A While which features a great sax interlude; the instrumental Driving Sideways; an emotional The Death of J B Lenoir; and the bitter Me and My Woman. Among the ten bonus cuts, my favorites are: the instrumantal Greeny; Missing You; Please Don't Tell, a bouncy Mayall-penned number; Your Funeral, My Trial, Double Trouble, and It Hurts Me Too. The two takes on Suspicions are a fine treat as well.  Whether you are a casual John Mayall fan or a completeist, you'll hear that Crusade is an essential part of his career work and merits a place in your music library. At this price, how can you hesitate?
B0012K1ILW|1.0|OMG!  Badu had absolutely no musical direction with this CD.  I bought it and played it in the car and turned right back around to get my money back (to no avail).  This is the worst CD I've ever heard- ever!  I love Badu, but this is pityful.  I love all music and I can't define this other than TRASH. I will make sure no one I know purchase this one or the 2nd version that comes out this summer! Maybe next time/album Erykah.    PS- Where were the vocals and lyrics that I am used to? Just mediocre repetition; I am baffled.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Supergroup? I don't know about that label. Jack White is pretty well known but the rest I'd barely heard of even though I am a music junkie. While calling the Raconteurs a supergroup may be a bit of a stretch, their debut Broken Boy Soldiers provides the kind of good basic indie rock that many music lovers yearn for.  Clocking in at just over a half-hour long, BBS reminds you of one of the worst aspects of vinyl:brevity. But there are just enough memorable songs here that you won't feel cheated after you listen. My favorite is the slow-rocking Blue Veins but I am also partial to Steady As She Goes, Broken Boy Soldier, Level, and Store Bought Bones.  Few bands play interesting yet straightforward rock and roll these days. The Raconteurs is one that does. If you like bands like Spoon, the Arctic Monkeys, and The Hold Steady then this may be for you.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I purchased this video for the grandchildren and they loved it. They want to see it over and over. And I loved it myself.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is another film based on a book, that does not EXACTLY follow said book. People, what do you want? I know of no film that stayed ENTIRELY faithful to any book! This \\"adaptation\\" was as good or better than the two films that preceded it.  To rank them based on their merit and entertainment value:    1) \\"I Am Legend\\"  2) \\"The Last Man on Earth\\"  3) \\"The Omega Man\\"    For many years, \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" was the best adaptation seen until \\"I Am Legend\\" was released (\\"The Omega Man\\" was a pale shadow compared to it's contemporaries).  The film is well defended. We still have a world very nearly devoid of human beings, the army of Hemocytes and all the trappings of a fortress that our protagonist Robert Neville, maintains to continue his research to find a cure.  The Hemocytes were effective, as there is a method to their madness. These aren't mindless zombies. They possess the intelligence to set traps. This leaves Neville with the unenviable task of second-guessing them just to stay alive (he is not entirely successful).    WARNING!!SPOILER ALERT!!!   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X    Neville's penchant for talking to his dog Sam, is particularly convincing, and sad. There are many of us who do this (myself included), which makes the loss of Sam heartfelt.  When Anna and Ethan arrive, Neville displays some strange behavior, as if he does not believe it is possible that others survived (kind of like pinching one's self to make sure it isn't a dream). Neville's argument about the plague being manmade, rather than an \\"act of God\\", bespeaks a man that has carried a mountain of guilt on his shoulders for his part in the disaster.    X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X    \\"I Am Legend\\" doesn't introduce anything new beyond the two previous films, but the use of CGI (which is not entirely great) makes the action introduced in the film effective. Will Smith does an EXCELLENT job. He's no Vincent Price, but he IS action-friendly, which makes the film that much more entertaining!    There are some interesting special features: Four animated comics related to the film, and DVD-ROM features on the film, and a history on viral infections.    A rock-solid five stars for an entertaining version of a classic novel.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|Almost 19 years ago I first read \\"The Mist\\". I immediately thought it would make a terrific movie. So it was with great excitement that I went to see this movie on Thanksgiving Day with my family. When we left the theater we heard everyone else saying how disgusted they were by the ending so we knew we were not alone in this sentiment. If you are a fan of the book and absolutely HAVE to see this movie, watch it and turn it off before the end. You will come away from the movie thinking that they did a great adaptation of King's novella. If you watch it all you will be horrified by the new ending that has been added. I wish I could forget I ever saw this abomination, it has ruined the memory of a great Stephen King story.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is a real sleeper.  Fascinating for its 1959 sensibilities with regard to the white man's burden, its depiction of \\"the natives,\\" the joys of being colonized by Belgium.  In fairness, it is also a fascinating psychological portrait of a woman torn between spirituality and the worlds of science and politics.  Hepburn at her best.  This is no Deborah Kerr on the beach potboiler.  Really rather unforgettable.
B00000DFSK|1.0|Who really likes U2? I think that they are really bad, and their vocalist Bono sings like he had been drinking alcohol. Every song on this disgraceful \\"Baddest Hits\\" compilation sucks. Don't purchase any CD from AC/DC, U2, The Doors, Slayer, Megadeth, Queen, and the Stones. For good CDs, get CDs by such artists like Miles Davis, Metallica(except K'EA), Jimi Hendrix, and Dire Straits. They will rock your socks out than any of the bands above.
B000AMUU94|5.0|David Bowie-The Platinum Collection *****<br /><br />With so many compilations to his name, some to his accord and some which he had nothing to due with, merely just record companies making money off the Bowie name, the question is, is this collection worthy of purchase with so many others available...Well yes actually. This is by far the best, and strongest collection of Bowie's entire career as far as biggest selling singles goes. This even include quite the number of songs that you wouldn't expect on the collection, and a prime example of this being 'John I'm Only Dancing (again)' which is something that most fans of Bowie would love to have on a collection like this but would never dream it possible to be included, which is further proof that you can not place a tag on David Bowie. This includes almost everything except for his mid 1990's work and 2000's work as even though he made some great music during this period it did not sell as well as his earlier material from 1968-1990.<br /><br />So basically for someone who is interested in David Bowie this would make a fine introduction to the musicians career leaving gaps for newer fans to decide what facet of Bowie's career and explore it more. But as for those who are already fans this is more then just another way to expand your collection of Bowie compilations.
B000E6EJAC|4.0|Matt the Hoople has always been a great group. Now they get their 2007/8 groupies from the Juno soundtrack.
B00004RD54|4.0|Lou Reed-Rock N Roll Animal ****<br /><br />When first off this is one of the best and clearest sounding live albums of all time. You can hear everything and nothing was lost in the recording process. The musicianship is top notch, Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner play incredible guitar, but then that is what you would expect from two of the best studio musicians in the history of rock n roll. Reed's vocals are clear and crisp but it does seem as though he is singing via satalite because he doesn't seem to really be in the mix of things, might be because of drugs and it might be because he just wasn't feeling it that night.<br /><br />The song selection is great. 'Rock N Roll' 'Heroin' 'Sweet Jane' and 'White Light/White Heat' all are Velvet Underground classics. 'Caroline Says I' 'How Do You Think It Feels' and 'Lady Day' are all from his then brand new album Berlin, which was a massive commercial failure but some how went on to be one of the greatest albums of all time, much like the rest of Reeds material has done.<br /><br />While the song selection was great that does not mean the perfomances are. 'Heroin' which is one of the single greatest songs of all time is played out like a comic strip here. 'White Light/White Heat' could have used a little more balls and a little less organ but other then that it is a pretty good version.<br /><br />All in all it is a pretty good live album. It captures a great moment in Lou Reed's career and would make an addition to anyones album collection.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This was actually the first concert DVD I ever owned, so I was really blown away from how awesome these guys looked on screen.    O.K., I'll try to make this short (though I'll probably fail at this).  This takes place during the \\"Train of Thought\\" world tour and it's at, of course, the very famous Budokan.  That being said, the band plays most of the 7 songs off the album (\\"Train of Thought\\" as I previously mentioned).  In fact, they play all but two of the songs off the album.  Incidentally, you get to hear those two songs on their next live DVD, \\"Score\\".  Other than that, they play mostly from the album before that, \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" and some from their earlier albums, hitting at least one song from each album except \\"A Change of Seasons\\".    The band is very excellent here with the exception of James, who sucks on a bunch of songs.  However, he is good or at least decent on some, usually the less challenging ones, such as \\"As I Am\\" and \\"Only a Matter of Time\\".  I'd like to take this opportunity now to say that James does a good job singing the songs Charlie used to sing in the sense that he still makes it sound like a Dream Theater song and doesn't make it sound weird with \\"an old song sung by a new singer\\".  However, on other songs, especially \\"Beyond This Life\\" (Having bad tone and pitch is one thing but why add a \\"w\\" sound to everything during the first word of each stanza of the chorus???), he sounds flat, nasally and generally off/unpleasant.  I've definitely seen better.  His stage behavior here has taken a turn for the worse too.  Apparently the worse his voice is the more he feels he has to move around and try to be dramatic, which to me just comes across as silly and very unnecessary.  He would have been find appearance-wise if he just for the most part kept still.  Don't worry though.  As proof my assertion is correct, he is much more relaxed and laid back in \\"Score\\" where is voice is tons better -- TONS.    Oh, I've spent all this timepicking on poor James.  On with the other guys.  We have a lot of people pissing and moaning about the band not \\"getting into the music\\".  Evidently unless musicians are grinning like a Cheshire cat, headbanging, jumping, dancing or generally speaking moving around in non-musical ways (ways that aren't related to playing their instrument) they're not into it.  I disagree.  The band appears to be enjoying themselves very much with some moderate smiling, save Myung who is like a stone, both on and off the stage.  (Has anyone ever seen him smile or laugh to date?  If he does do this at all he must do it in private.)  Besides, they have to concentrate a lot of the time on what they're doing.  Mike is always amusing with his smiling and little quirks and gestures and this is no exception.  Still twirls those sticks like a pro!    The musicianship is quite excellent as well.  They do a great job reproducing the songs live as on the CD and even the solos usually stay the same.  Not a whole lot of improv BUT they do add some goodies here.  First you get an extended version of \\"Beyond This Life\\" where they do a very long jam in the middle, which includes a keyboard and drum duel (very cool).  Next you get \\"Instrumedley\\" which is a medley of their various instrumentals, INCLUDING a bit from Liquid Tension Experiment!  After that you get a keyboard solo from Jordan, which, honestly, in my opinion was pretty good but could have been better.  He did the whole thing with the pitch wheel and distortion and it made it sound more like a guitar thing for half the time and that's just not that interesting to me.  The second part was pretty cool though.    So, yes, if you're expecting a great concert from the band, you won't be disappointed, despite the flaws I mentioned.  It'll fill you up with energy and make you want to throw the nearest emo out a window or pick up an instrument and futily try to play like the band!    As a bonus, you get to see the Japanese audience, which in caseyou don't know are the coolest audiences out there.  They are VERY respectful and many if not most even stand the whole concert without moving save the occassional applause.  You even see some wearing suits like they just got off from work!  Not an emotion on their face.  Very little headbanging or going wild.  Many of you may think it's lame but I think it's cool because it shows lots of restraint and composure and they do enjoy the concerts very much by show of applause at the end of their songs and the concert.  Better than a bunch of drunken boors screaming so loud as if they were trying to drown out the music.    You also get a cool documentary that shows them arriving in Japan and getting ready for the tour, complete with interviews.  It does portray the male Japanese fans as complete nerds though.    There's also an added drum solo from Mike where he takes a couple audience members on stage and has them jam with him.  He's very good at this though and appears to be having fun with this the entire time, even grooving the lucky audience members in with his playing.    There's the multi-angle bonus of instrumedley but I for some reason it just looks like the same footage you get on the first disc.  Maybe I'm missing something....    So, anyway, get this DVD if you're a fan or even if you're just starting to get into the band.  It's great.  Nothing more to say.    Well, I was SUPPOSED to make this short, but, oh, well.  I tried....
B000ULQV0W|5.0|There have been many great reviews written about this CD, so I'll keep mine brief.  I give the CD five stars without hesitation.  I simply wish to add something here: the song \\"Rise\\" is flat out a masterpiece.  The heavens and earth open up and go joyously wild in celebration when listening to this song.  It's true.  Just listen to it several times and you'll see.
B000P0J09C|5.0|I spent 1992-2001 in the Marine Corps Infantry. And this movie is a favorite among Marines no matter where they are.<br /><br />While I think that it is absolutely inappropriate for children, you will have to make that decision on your own as a parent. But be warned, the language in this movie is very harsh.<br /><br />R. Lee Ermey plays the part of Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Seargeant Hartman (that's a mouthfull), his euphemisms, mannerisms and behavior are perfect. He absolutely nailed it.<br /><br />If you've got any friends, relatives or acquaintances that are in the Corps, this is always a winner of a gift. Particularly if they are getting ready for deployment (ship life is a drag).<br /><br />A caveat about reality...with the demise of conscription and the institution of the \\"all volunteer force,\\" Drill Instructors no longer administer corporal punishment (i.e. they do not strike the recruits). Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a former recruit trying to embellish the experience (for amorous purposes no doubt), or smear the Marine Corps (for nefarious purposes no doubt).
B000X1R4S2|4.0|\\"It\\" by Stephen, © 1981     Bill Denbrough is eleven years old.  He lost his kid brother to a monster last fall and it has become the bane of his existence.  He has six friends who eventually help him kill 'it'.  He, and his friends, also have the bullies from school to fight every so often.  This 'it' is magical and the lives of these two groups are interfered with by the magic.  It is funny how the memory of what is happening blurs into what happened twenty eight years ago and then blurs out just as fast.   Part of the joy of reading Mr King's stories is that he makes the people seem so real and alive.  Sometimes you get to know and understand even the smallest character as well as any of the others.  It makes reading the book interesting.  In the end, you have to wonder what happened to Eddie's wife, Myna?  How did she get on?  What did she do with the business?  Etc, etc.  You only got to know her through ten or so pages, but she was there and in the memory of all that occurred afterward.   It does seem that Mr. King wrote of fifteen year olds, not eleven year olds.  At one point it was bandied about buying beer, at another things and realizations happened that were beyond the thought of eleven year olds, or maybe even fifteen year olds.  It may have been the magic of (or 'needed for') the story and what not, but it sticks out like a sore thumb.  What happens is well explained and acceptable as presented, just not for eleven year olds.   It is no wonder it took five years to write this story.  The plot was intricate and some of the ploys became weird, yet it turned out okay.  \\"The Stand\\" was better.  Now off to read another of his stories.  See if he can do better then \\"The Stand.\\"
B0010YSD7M|1.0|Well I must say that this movie was a dissapointmen. There is so much the writers could have done with this story. But somehow this became more about the replicators than the Ori/priors. Honestly I expected an all out battle between the priors & SG-1 and between the Ori & the ancients. But instead it was a battle with the replicators. I thought it was lame & it took from the main bad guys which were the Ori. There was so much story & discoveries they could have shown, but the writers took they easy way out. I think it could have been cool to use all of earth's ship in a battle against the ori ships. That would have been cool. But no Lets go back to a story that we have over done \\"the replicators\\". Honestly I am a huge fan of this show because of the story that they told in the TV series, but now I feel that the writers owe us a great ori story. I think that they told better stories in the TV series than the movie. I honestly hope that the they put a little more effort in the 2nd movie.
B00133MKVK|2.0|I love Shirley, I truly do... Love the 2 new songs -- the title song and \\"The Living Tree\\" are wonderful. I'd give these new songs 4-1/2 stars.  However, I am disappointed that she couldn't find 10 more new songs to record. After all, her last full-length studio album was released in 1996! The remixes are fine, but are not a substitute for brand-new recordings. Come on Shirley, get your Dameship into the studio and record a whole new album!
0307346617|5.0|Novellas are classic in the SciFi genre for getting across a theme in a brief encounter where background and personal history on superfluous characters are unimportant. This full length novel does the same thing, except each \\"chapter\\" is not unlike a novella that stands on its own.     The situations are real enough to be believable; the effects of herd mentality (think vestigial humanity.. er, MTV watching city folk) and rugged individualists on the breakdown of society are key themes. Whether in pitched battles, the living fleeing zombie hordes or your average friend/family is a zombie dilemma - this book will suck you in like a stellar black hole.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|As a teacher of high school seniors and juniors I use this film as part of out Capital Punishment unit. The reason? This film explores all perspectives.
0312945973|5.0|As a person that loves historical fiction, I was intrigued by the title, when it said that it was a novel set in Ancient Egypt.There seems to be so few books that are written in this time period.<br /> I picked it up at my local library, one day after work ,and decided that I would read a couple of pages to see if I wanted to check it out or not.I ended up reading three chapters, before I could pull myself away. This was a book that was next to impossible to put down.<br /> It is a story of Ancient Egypt, told through the eyes of a eunuch slave and the girl (who would become a future queen)that he is sworn to protect. It is the story of someone who sees the rise, fall and eventual rebirth of the Egyptian Empire and the part that he played to help shape it. The hero, Taitha ,goes to any length to protect two lovers, sways the opinions of a Pharaoh, witnesses the Egyptian war with the Hyskos, lives with an Ethiopian king and much more. The main point of the story that was so moving to me was, throughout all of the lies and the manipulation and power struggles, Taitha never loses his humanity. He never loses his compassion, he never loses sight of the fact that his duty is to the woman that he has sworn his whole life to, he never strays from undying devotion and love for the people that mean everything to him.  Taitha sacrifices everything, even his own personal feelings, to save and protect his Queen. I have never read any Wilbur Smith books before. This was my first one, but I will have to say that this novel brings to life the world of the Ancients, stirs the emotions and leaves the reader wanting more. A rare and dazzling entertainment that I did not want to end.
0307276902|4.0|NOTE: I have been living in China for 2 1/2 years.  Just returned to the US in January 2008.  So, when I wrote the review below, I did NOT know that the book was in fact fiction or that there had been a whole flap about it on Oprah.     A Million Little Pieces is the incredible memoir of James Frey's alcohol and drug addition and recovery.  In a wealth of horrific detail, Frey describes the insatiable and overpowering physical urges he felt. Even when throwing up blood seven times a day, peeing blood, and pooping blood, he was powerless to stop.  Only when he is severely injured on a fire escape and plunked onto a plane by a friend does he arrive, still unwillingly, at the world's best rehab clinic, Hazelden. It is almost unbelieveable that Frey is alive, and amazing that he could write like a novelist so soon after his recovery.  I can't imagine that a person who is blacking out on a daily basis could manage to get a college degree or hold a job either, but it goes to show how strong Frey's mind and constitution are.    Frey's style is reminiscent of Hemingway. It is concise and poetic.  The book is a real page-turner, which I couldn't put down. Despite the sadness and scariness of the subject matter, it was a great read. This book probably should be read by every teenager everywhere.    I gave the book four stars rather than five, because he left too many questions unanswered.  How did he manage to get a college degree? In what? What kind of job did his parents get him in Europe and how did he manage to show up and do it? Did he get fired? What event(s) caused it? What happened while he was in prison? What happened to Lilly and their relationship while James was in prison?  Why did Lilly commit suicide when James was set to be released in only two days?  And most importantly, how has he managed to stay sober and what is he doing now?!  I can only hope that reveals the answers in another book!  I am certainly glad that a writer of his potential was not lost to chemical dependency! I hope he writes much more in his lifetime!

B00133KFGW|5.0|My family watched this movie and found it outstanding.  When it was over both my wife and I agreed that there was defiantly a family resemblance between this story line and the movie \\"Oliver\\" from the novel Oliver Twist.<br /><br />Where:<br />Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) = Oliver Twist<br />Arthur (Leon G. Thomas III) = the Artful Dodger<br />Wizard (Robin Williams) = Fagan<br /><br />Also we saw some shades of Mr. Holland's Opus<br /><br />Any way I highly recommend the move, it's a great drama, with heartwarming conclusion.<br /><br />Buy is and Buy the sound track.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a really beautiful film and great for family viewing.  After watching this my kids wanted to explore new places, work on art {crayon, markers, clay, and bead} projects.  And I think watching this made them appreciate what they have.  It had never occured to them that a child might have to have a job or much responsibility at all.  I have had less of a struggle getting them to do chores since we watched this.  They were at first bothered by what happenend to the parents.  I don't think they really thought bad things could happen to parents.  But they understand this is magical, and I don't think it had a bad effect on them.  We will watch this again.  It's a little long, and we all got a little fidgety at the end.  But it was wonderful and really beautiful fantasy art.
0425170349|4.0|I was disappointed in this book.  It was too drawn out and too many subplots.  Hard to keep all the characters in mind.  Actually, if I hadn't read any of Vince Flynn's books, I might have been a little more excited about this book.  I have read some other Clancy books and enjoyed them, but     this one dragged on.
0452289963|5.0|first 20-30 pages of the book and you will be hooked! ...  I love this book, but I will be the first to admit, that I definitely struggled with reading the first chapter or so...  and it truly does have a life changing message for all of those who are open and ready to \\"hear\\" it...  having said that, if after reading a few chapters it still does not ring true to you, perhaps just put it aside for a later time or pass it along to someone else to \\"try\\"!
B000063DFN|5.0|This is one of my fav IRON MAIDEN albums. Awesome guitar riffs and super melodies. Great vocals Bruce Dickinson at his best.
B00004Z459|3.0|Link Park.  A cross between Hip-Hop and modern metal.  Back in 2000 when I first purchased this album, I really enjoyed it, both the music and lyrics.  To put it into retrospect, I enjoyed mostly anything that was on the radio.  In later years, I have begun to lose respect for both.  While I do enjoy their unique sound it becomes very monotonous rather quickly.  All of their individual songs blend in together to make one loud sonic blob.      One of the many issues I take with Hybrid Theory are the lyrics.  It's obvious that Linkin Park was pandering to teenagers (a group that just so happens to spend the most on music) when writing the lyrics.  Despite Cure for the itch, every song is just a pity party and rant fest.  Who is Linkin Park complaining too anyhow?  Their parents?  Siblings?  Friends?  Why the egotistic and pessimistic attitude?  Why are the group members so depressed and angry?   From what I can make out, their social life seems quite miserable.  Perhaps they misbehaved and were sent to their room for a 10 minute time out.   Whatever the reason is, it's annoying to the ear and is a sign of an immature band.      The more I listen to classic rock, the more I realize just how much talent is missing from most of today's mainstream, top 40 music.  Linkin Park really doesn't possess the ingenuity and frankly creativity to sculpt an album that will be memorable past the teenage years.  Can you imagine these guys making a decent concept album?  Hell would freeze over first.  How about having a guitar solo?  Nope, it's just too difficult to string single notes together to construct a simple appeasing harmony.  Instead, lets have lots of raping/ screaming, heavy power cords and lyrics that stay as far from optimism as possible.  Hey, it sells records.    To conclude, I enjoy all kinds of music including heavy rock; however, when I listen to LP, I feel like I'm back in middle school with the angry attitude and lack of respect for any music that's  older than three years.  It's not a good feeling.
B00005JA2B|5.0|KANSAS - Leftoverture (1976)  (*****)  10 tracks - (55:23)<br /><br />Leftoverture, KANSAS's fourth album, released in 1976, is almost universally accepted as a Classic Rock Masterpiece, just as it's full 5-star rating shows!  It is also considered the band's top progressive album, just above Song For America.  Although there are not as many epic-length songs, the ones presented are highly arranged and orchestrated.  Kerry Livgren (guitar/keyboards) wrote many of the songs on his own, a few more with Steve Walsh (vocals/ keyboards), and collaborated with the whole band on Magnum Opus.  In fact Livgren was on quite a roll during the recording sessions for Leftoverture.<br /><br />The album was the band's most successful effort up to that point, and kind of took them by surprise when it moved into the top five on the album charts.  The band soon went from an \\"opening act\\" to their first headlining tour.  Much of the bands success came on the heels of Carry On Wayward Son, which peaked at #11 and eventually became an FM Rock radio staple.  It is easily one of my personal favorite songs of all time.  Whenever someone tries to pick my brain on music trivia and eventually asks me what I think is the greatest rock song of all time; I'm quick to say, \\"Kansas - Carry On Wayward Son\\".  It's got everything a good rock song needs: Great vocals, a punchy drum beat, good keyboards, and searing guitars all wrapped into one.<br /><br />There is simply not a weak song on the whole album.  Start to finish, it just keeps on delivering.  From great Rock, to progressive masterpieces like Miracles Out of Nowhere, Cheyenne Anthem, and the epic-length Magnum Opus.  If you don't own any KANSAS albums, this is definitely a good place to start.<br /><br />***** Highly Recommended *****<br /><br />This 2001 EPIC/Legacy remaster has two added bonus tracks.  Carry On Wayward Son and Cheyenne Anthem \\"Live\\", both previously unreleased.  These are nice additions to the original album that can one day be merged into a complete 2-disc set of Live Kansas when Two For The Show is eventually remastered.<br /><br />Best Tracks: They're All Good!set of Live Kansas when Two For The Show is eventually remastered.    Best Tracks: They're All Good!
B0011QC9U6|4.0|Yea, you could dismiss Beowulf as massively silly, but you would be missing the fact that it is completely entertaining and great fun.  To simply see it as a big screen video game, because of the similar, though far superior, graphics is likewise to miss the point.  The advances in motion capture technology are becoming increasingly intriguing and weirdly compelling in this nexus combining live action and actors with the unbridled imaginative freedom of animation.  There is simply no other way to achieve some of the effects we see here, with sweeping camera moves, odd perspectives and shots that would be impossible or cost prohibitive to achieve in old film technique.    Bloody good fun, I was caught up in the energy and pure pizazz of Beowulf, reminiscent to me of the thrill of Ray Harryhausen's progressively more impressive stop motion work when I was a kid.  I'm beginning to understand Robert Zemeckis's stubborn obsession with this new technology because now I see that this medium has incredible potential.  Worthwhile to the unsnobish lover of pure cinema fun and magic.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I brought these headphones because of the reviews of other customers and I must say they are all that.  They did hurt my ears for a minute but I guess I have now gotten adjusted to them and for the price they work wonderfully I purchased 3 pair 1 just in case they broke 1 to use and my 18 year old Nephew borrowed 1 pair because his pair that came with his MP3 played just didn't do it for him when he tryed my Sony on he really was impressed so I lost that one.  Thank you Amazon Customer you really are the best for information I buy nothing without reading the reviews first.
B00008RWAX|4.0|I was sad to finish this book, as I am with any book that has become like a friend.  It is a long book (my favorite kind), describing Mandela's long walk to freedom, but definitely worth it for those who love history, freedom, and justice.     There are several spots where the names of people, places, and organizations are almost overwhelming.  I referred to the map and photographs frequently to get a visual idea of events to help me understand the story.  I couldn't keep up with the names of most other leaders in the organizations, but I never felt like giving up.  The book is full of wonderful details that put the reader there in Africa with Mandela.    The best parts of the story for me were the trials and the prison years because they helped me understand Nelson Mandela and his mind.  It was hard for me to say goodbye to this good and sensible man when I finished.
042521771X|3.0|It's a bit of a rehash from the actual novel, with passages lifted directly from the original novel.  I found myslef just wanting it to be over in a lot of places.

B00000J7S8|4.0|There are tons of reviews out there for this CD.  I just wanted to add that there is not better way to relax than to sit on a deck or patio in the summer with the beverage of your choice and this playing in the background.
0452289963|5.0|This book reads alot like Dr. Wayne Dyer's \\"Erroneous Zones\\" which was published in 1975.  All the principles are the same.  Mr. Tolle is a bit more deep than Dr. Wayne Dyer, but it reflects so much the same ideas and the ways to think and live..   As I read each chapter, I was reminded how Dr. Wayne Dyer had said it in his book.  \\"Erroneous Zones\\" is a bit more practical and simple to understand, but Mr. Tolle's book has some very 'aha's moments in it as well.  He does go off the deep at times, but for the most part, understanding the ego (which Dyer explains is 'Edging God Out', and how damaging it can be for all of us to think and feel that we are so important is helpful to read about and really think about as well.  Do yourself a favor, pick up the book or tape of Dr. Wayne Dyer's   'Zones' and you will see how familiar they actually are.  Authors such as these two fine writers and men, need to be read and more than once.  If you are open to what they have to say, you will be asking yourself some important questions such as: \\"Do I do that, do I really think that way, have I treated someone in that manner?\\"   Mr. Tolle's book is one for everyone's bookshelf.  Be sure though to add 'anything' written by Dr. Wayne Dyer.  He is the best at self-development and improvement.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is a movie that really demands to be seen projected on a big screen.  I was lucky enough to see the movie in theaters around 1990 when the restoration of the movie was completed and it was re-released.    It's a movie that could not get made today.  There are no women, no car-chases, not a great deal of action, and not a lot of dialogue.  Yet the movie is a masterpiece.  Subtle performances from the legendary supporting cast, plus a star-making turn from Peter O'Toole.  It's a complex movie that demands some involvement from the viewer.  If you prefer to have ever plot detail laid out for you on a platter, stick to the latest installment of the \\"Fast and the Furious\\" franchise and leave this one alone.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Very fast paced, lots of action, very creative. But thats al said and done now the only thing to think about now is the future release for dvd/blu-ray. They had only planned on making it on hd dvd but since all hd dvd production was stopped they are trying to make a last minute blu-ray version. But Ive read that this news came after they had already been working on it for like a month then their contract with toshiba got revoked. Meaning that they might not have enugh time to put in all the important extras into the blu-ray version. If the make a compromised blu-ray disc to rlease it on the same day that would be so upsetting. Im sure every fan of the movie and of blu-ray would be willing to wait and have the solid release come out a month or two later.
B00005JPTK|1.0|I won't review the movie because this has already been done. That being said, I would give the movie 3.5 stars. What I will rate is the 2-disc \\"Special Edition\\" of this movie.<br /><br />The 1st disc is no different than the single release. It contains the theatrical version of the movie and 4 animated comics: Death As a Gift, Isolation, Sacrificing the Few for the Many, and Shelter.<br /><br />The 2nd disc contains the movie as it was in the theater except for how it ends. I won't spoil it, but it adds about 4 minutes more and the ending is completely different from how it ends in the theatrical release. The 2nd disc also allows you to download a digital version of the movie to your computer or portable media device.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this 2-disc edition is not worth the extra money it costs. Why Warner Bros. couldn't just create a branching edition of the movie on the first disc seems to point towards corporate greed. But, I'm seeing this more and more on other releases where the 2nd DVD is nothing more than a way to purchase a digital version of the movie. Pretty lame in my honest opinion.<br /><br />I say rent the 2-disc version if you wish to see the alternate ending. Otherwise, if you wish to purchase the movie, just go and get the single disc version instead. It's cheaper and you really aren't losing out on the alternate ending which really isn't controversial at all.<br /><br />However, due to the lack of special features (making of documentary, etc) and the cheap attempt at charging more money by supplying a different cut of the movie on a separate disc as well as to download a digital version of the movie, this 2-disc release gets a 1 star. The 1-disc would get 2 stars due to the lack of special features.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|Another Country is a really satisfying collection of songs, the mood is reflective and there is a lot of nuance and subtlety to the instrumentation, and the quality of the songs really shines. I think Doug Pettibone who guests here also plays with Lucinda Williams? Well it really works. Tift's voice is just...heavenly.
037571457X|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is a great read. In less than two hours, you'll know more about Iranian history than you probably ever did. I, for one, felt positively ignorant as I learned of the Shah, the Islamic revolution, the Communist sympathizers... all told through the eyes of a teenage girl who thinks she is a prophet. The book is informative, fun, and an easy read. It will dispel many stereotypes without resorting to political correctness. I'm very glad I opted for the book over the movie version currently in theaters. I'm often bored by animation, but the graphic novel is interactive and the story flows nicely. Read it... you won't regret it.
0451450523|5.0|I like Peter S Beagle because even though his stories are set in mythical worlds or the spirit world they deal with grave issues of human existence  that unsettle the reader.    I discovered this wonderful author through the animated version of The Last Unicorn, which I had watched as a child. The cartoon was so disturbing (in a good way) that years later images from it would flash in my mind. It was only recently that I discovered that it was an adaptation and immediately purchased the novel.    While the animated version has its own hypnotic allure, the novel is a million times better. Written in a lyrical style that is almost dream-like, the novel narrates the story of a solitary unicorn who leaves her forest in search of her kind. Her journey leads her to friendship,  danger, human experience and even love that is impossible.    What draws me to the novel is the almost morbid tone that pervades the greater part of the novel and the philosophic element of the prose.   The novel deals with friendship, loyalty, what it means to be immortal and the pangs of human existence. Reading the novel I was glad that I am mortal, for harbouring sorrow, loss and regret for eternity is a far greater torture than fear of death.    Though the novel does not end in the traditional fairy tale mode, it is a satisfying ending that resurges all the themes discussed in the novel.  You will be haunted by this story for a very long time.       My only problem with the novel is that it is classified as young adults' fiction. This might deflect an adult readership. Don't be misguided by the classification. This is a novel that can be read at various levels and enjoyed by all.

B000M2EH32|5.0|If you want to get a feel for this album check the video on YouTube. Mario has a husky voice with a style similar to Sinatra. Integral to the sound is the excellent work by the band, the High Five Quintet. This is not a band thrown together to back him up but a working jazz quintet. I have a very good modern jazz album they did earlier. These guys are no lightweights and are very good straight ahead players. Like most of the music on the Schema label this album is very jazzy , cool, nu-jazz. All the songs are very good. The album sold very well in Italy and I suspect all over Europe where a lot of young people are into danceable jazz and straight ahead groups play at raves.
0810994739|5.0|This is the second book in the series, in what we hope will be many more to follow - if you have boys who have not embraced reading - this is a series of books that may just get them on track.  I can only tell you that we pre -ordered it once we learned that there would be a follow up to \\"Diary of a Wimpy kid\\"  - start with that one.  Kids will sit there and giggle through the whole book. I have recommended to PARENTS with non readers and they have loved it. Readers have been quoted as saying \\"this book is the bomb\\" when will there be another one !!!!! Got to love that coming out of the mouth of kids who do not like to read ANYTHING!!! Great job Jeff Kinney - you rule.
B00004T9VY|4.0|Cat Stevens' Tea For The Tillerman (1970) is Cat's best album, and it's also an album that I like quite a bit. I didn't care much for Cat's music when this, and his other most popular albums, came out. I was into other types of rock music at the time. But since then, I've checked out some Cat Stevens music here and there, and I can relate now and then. I like to listen to Tea For The Tillerman when I'm the mood for his mature, spiritual and somewhat somber sound. Most of the songs are built around Cat's mellow acoustic guitar, but some are piano-based and orchestrated.<br /><br />The album opens with Where Do The Children Play, and this is one of the album's most popular songs. It's a great one, too, and very thought provoking, but as I listen to it today it's hard to believe that back in 1970, we actually thought that the world's movers and shakers would actually stop to consider Cat's question.<br /><br />I know we've come a long way<br />We're changing day to day<br />But tell me, where do the children play?<br /><br />Wild World is probably Cat's most enduring and popular song. It's the only one I've heard on the radio in the last decade, anyway. It's a lonely and resigned song, sung by someone who's being left by a lover and even though he is heartbroken, he does his best to give friendly advice to the one who's leaving him behind.<br /><br />I like the somber and sacred Sad Lisa, too. It's a minor-key piano and chamber orchestra dirge about a friend who is trapped in her own sadness. Longer Boats is a hopeful chant-like song that has a catchy melody, and Hard Headed Woman is Stevens' search for a woman who will \\"make me do my best\\". I Might Die Tonight is reflective and spiritually themed.<br /><br />Tea For The Tillerman is an album that's best listened to when you're in a solemn mood or you just feel like hearing something thoughtful and mellow. It's a top-notch production by a talented and spiritually minded artist. It'll brighten your spirits if you're feeling down, but it might also make you wonder what ever happened to all the optimistic spiritual enthusiasm that used to be in America.what ever happened to all the optimistic spiritual enthusiasm that used to be in America.
0553208845|5.0|I can't think of anyone who would read this book and not find something to grab onto from reading it.  I think just about anyone can see a little bit of themselves through the character of Siddharth, the journey for authenticity which only comes through living life.  Wisdom has to be experienced and we learn that from this book.  Each of us has so many potential paths we could follow or so many different lives we could live but in the end how things play out is the one we were meant to be on. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  To the reviewer who said its all about the self.  Love has to start with loving yourself before you can love anything else, if you don't love yourself nothing else follows.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I loved this cd. One quesation. Why was Lover Boy by Slivia and Micky left out. Just trying to find out why or where I can get it. Otherwise the cd is one of the greatest!
B00133KFGW|5.0|If you have any love for music at all, you'll enjoy this movie.  There's a language that goes along with music...it makes the sounds that the soul wants to speak but can't find words for.  It sings of celebration, joy, hurt, anguish...and other depths of emotion that we can't even begin to explain.  This movie does a wonderful job of expressing that.      As a musician, I actually ached inside watching it because I understood what August heard in the world.  His musical pureness was exquisite.  He didn't understand the capitalist edge he had that Wizard tried to exploit because of his gift.  He didn't understand the importance and grandeur of his accomplishment at Juliard.  He simply heard the music and knew in his heart that it would serve him good in mending the broken relationships of his life.  That is the essence of music...touching the areas of life that otherwise would not be reached.    If you watch this movie with just your eyes, you may not be as delighted with it.  But watch it with your heart and you won't be able to help but stand and cheer!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Where do I even begin? I LOVE this film. I found the acting to be superb, the script was well thought out and believable, the effects were incredible in that you believe them without thinking \\"Neat effect\\". I loved the claustrophobic feel of being on the ship with them, the pandemonium of the battle scenes, the touching friendships, and even the old sea tales and superstitions. The blood and battles were realistic without being over-the-top gore fests. And for the first time in a while... I truely cared what happened to these characters. I wanted so badly for the Doctor to get his creatures, and for Jack to catch his ship. The characters were protrayed as intelligent (which is rare in action and adventure films) and Jack and the French captain (whom you rarely see) play a tremendous game of mental chess throughout the film. A word to the wise... there are several instances where the dialogue was hard to hear... I turned up the surround sound and almost blew it out at the next cannon battle. The fight scenes will shake the walls if you have surround sound.
0452289963|1.0|This book essentially maps out a series of ways to sit and relax.  To use it's information and claim to have found enlightenment through it is absolutely absurd!  Life is too complex to pretend to be a flower or a bird and then forget about everything else.  You are better off going on a hike or even a short walk around town to gain some perspective on existence.  Tolle wants your money, no matter how much you think he cares about your path in life.  It's as simple as that.
B000FA57NK|5.0|If you don't own an HD-DVD player stop now.  Yes the format is dead-and NO I am not sorry one whit I bought one.  That aside, this movie is reviewed in detail elsewhere, so I'm just dealing with the HD-DVD version and how it stacks up against the other formats.  I've owned the regular DVD and the laserdisc version of this movie- and this one is SOOO much better. Crystal clear picture with remarkable detail.  The space sequences are breathtaking in beauty.  The launch sequence is a great demo- though not as aggressive on the subwoofer as I'd expected or hoped for.  Well worth the bargain price now that the format war is over.  As an aside- if you need a new dvd player consider an HD-DVD player.  They're on sale and GREAT upconverters for regular DVD's- and as a bonus, play true HD-DVD movies.  I expect getting years of enjoyment from mine.
1594200696|5.0|First off, I want to say that the cover portrayed currently, a blue cover, isn't what I got when I ordered it. I got a cloth red cover like the picture added by a customer. The cloth red cover is a bit rough to the touch and isn't the best, but as soon as you open it and see the gorgeous, glossy, full color illustrations paired with the text we know and love from previous editions, you will be thrilled to have this book.<br /><br />I opened my parcel in front of a guest and she immediately wanted to feel it and read it. The illustrations add a lot of charm.<br /><br />If you have read this book before and want a copy to keep, or are giving this book as a gift to a writer or reader, this would be the edition I'd choose. It is well worth the extra money and is a wonderful edtion to any library.<br /><br />The old Strunk and White I read because I felt I should, this edition I read because it is a pleasure.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|If you saw the movie and liked it, you will love the soundtrack.  The artists are fantastic!
B0000507R2|5.0|Here I am listening to Natalie's album nearly 13 years of after its release and the song \\"River\\" caught my attention. It took me this long to figure out that this song may be about the death of River Phoenix (yes, I just now paid attention to the lyrics).  Still one of my favorite albums of all time.
B00005A46T|1.0|I'm going to ask you to either resist your impulse to buy this album, or stop listening to it if you already own it.  I used to love Slipknot, so I can't just get on my high horse and scream about how stupid any fan of this band is, I know the appeal, I know what the name Slipknot represents to a large number of people reading this review.         A few years ago I thought Slipknot was the absolute pinnacle of aggression and honesty in music. The fact is that this music is so far from honest that it makes me sick, the rock back-beats and vocal hooks blatantly pander to an impressionable fan-base, and the attempts at heaviness totally rape the amazing accomplishments of Grind and Hardcore bands that preceded them.         So here's my plea: don't buy this album until you've listened to Converge, Pig Destroyer, Breather Resist, or early ISIS. There's myspace pages for all of the above and amazon samples galore; at least give them a chance before you make this miss-step.
B00005JKG9|5.0|If your in sales, then you have to get this movie. If your in management and you have people under you, then get this movie. The concept of the script is well written and the actors are great. Alec Baldwin was incredible in this movie. He has passion, wit, confidence and very inspiring. I am in sales and this said it all...greed, money, survival, and doing what is right. Bravo! Bravo!
B00133KHCY|5.0|This a beautiful movie beyond expression of any words. My daughter of 12 and I liked it very much. It's all about music, love and about dreams coming true and talent
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|When me and my friends decided to rent the movie Once (we are all guitarists, and the poster of them walking on a fretboard is what intrigued our interests) we just fell in love with the music and the story.  I found myself going to the net to grab tabs for songs.  Then I went in a store and was going to buy the soundtrack . . . and stopped.  I saw the Swell Season standing there.  I took a risk and bought it instead.    I am glad I did.    This album is even better than the soundtrack.  The souls are bare, the production is tight, and there isn't a single flaw.  I have fallen in love with these two.  They just compliment each other so well, it's breath taking.    If you love singer/songwriters who write with their soul laid out in front of you, buy this album immediately.
1878424505|5.0|I loved this book and have used the four agreements with great results in my life.  I, therefore, bought it for my three daughters.
B00005ASHM|3.0|Yes, there are good songs here, but the sound quality is AWFUL.  Compared to other recordings of its time (and earlier, much earlier), it doesn't sound much better than an AM radio.  Tinny, way too much reverb, no clarity to the instruments, etc.  I had read so much about this album, and when I finally got it, I was terribly disappointed that it sounded so awful.  Oh well...
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Gattaca is a brilliant, thought-provoking story of an man who, though underprivileged by birth as a genetic \\"in-valid\\", strives to fulfill his dream of traveling into space in a society obsessed with genetic perfection. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman display great chemistry together (which is only natural of course since Gattaca came out when they were a real-life couple). Jude Law, playing his first role in a U.S. film, is perfectly cast as the genetically handcrafted man whom fate has reduced to the role of a cynical surrogate identity. The supporting cast does an admirable job, as well. Gattaca handles its subject matter with intelligence and ties its storyline together with a thread of tightly woven yet understated suspense.     Gattaca's visuals are stunning and provide a distinctive feel. The scenery is cold, stark and utilitarian - a blend of both neo- and retro-futuristic motifs. Outdoor scenes are set with earthy tones and stylized golden hues, giving the film a tidy yet dystopian feel. Plus Gattaca features a musical score that I can only describe as hauntingly triumphant.     Needless to say, this is one of my favorite cinematic treasures, one that I highly recommend.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|\\"Why does everything have to be a travesty with you, Walter?\\" -- The Dude.<br /><br />I'm not going to write the usual things that you read in reviews about this film because there are a lot of reviews here that are incredibly repetitive and another one wouldn't serve anybody. Also, I live in Los Angeles, do work and have worked in the film business in different capacities over the years and I have very different things to say about this film ... so readers be warned.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it was released at the Hollywood Galaxy with a few friends and I'll be honest, the scope and impact of it didn't hit me right away. After I saw it, I didn't say \\"Sweet Jesus ... that's a masterpiece!\\" It was only when I saw it a few more times in the next handful of years did it dawn on me how good this film actually is.<br /><br />First, I want to tell you that the bowling alley where this was filmed, no longer exists. The Los Angeles Unified School District annexed the land, tore down the structure and erected a high school in its place. I used to bowl there regularly when it was still kicking though and I even have a memory of seeing the \\"We're going to be closed due to filming\\" sign that was slapped across the glass door just before they shot it. I also have a memory of the sign that said \\"We're closing our doors for good\\" sign when they put that up, too. Sadly, a lot of the fixtures, the exterior lights and different pieces of memorabilia were vultured and used as interior d&eacute;cor at the uber-silly Lucky Strike lanes located in the mega center of Hollywood and Highland. `Lucky Strike' is a place where no self-respecting bowler would step foot into, it's a place where they cheerfully play `The Eagles' on the jukebox and bourgeois fascists run amuck. It's a place full of fake tan wannabe trust-funders reciting `Killers' lyrics in a drunken haze as if it were poetry. I mourned the day the Hollywood Star Lanes closed and wept the day Lucky Strike opened with its stolen d&eacute;cor. If Walter Sobchak had anything to say, he'd do something about it.<br /><br />\\"If you will it, dude ... it is no dream.\\" -- Walter.<br /><br />The next place is Johnnie's over on Wilshire and La Brea. Johnnie's was fully functional during the time that they shot there, just like Hollywood Lanes, but now it's a full-time film location and only opens for crews when they're shooting something. Some may sigh and feel bummed that they missed the opportunity to eat at the counter like Walter, all I can say is don't worry about it. I ate there several times and it was pretty bad. The waitresses were original d&eacute;cor too, the food was almost inedible and the coffee smelled like turpentine. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. If anyone tells you different about Johnnie's, don't bite - it's a sham. It's just one of those things that looked better on film than it ever was in real life. It's no mistake the Tom Waits never bothered to mention the place in song.<br /><br />\\"The Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!\\" -- Walter.<br /><br />Next, I've been on a few film sets through years, and every time I hear the Director or the Producer utter the title of this film, I immediately freeze to hear what's coming next. One set in particular, the Director squealed out during an argument with a production person: \\"It's going to be just like The Big Lebowski!\\" I cringed when I heard that, as did several other people. Trying not to laugh was also painful. Nothing could be like The Big Lebowski. If anything could, we'd be surrounded by close facsimiles and we're not, which is why this film is such a classic now, from the first frame to the last. People will struggle to emulate this film in every way and probably all will fail. Even now, I've heard rumor that there is a screenplay and plans for another installment of The Dude and his troubles. The word `sequel' is not being used and thusly avoided. It's anybody's guess as to what's going to happenand when. You can hate me for mentioning this and say I'm full of it, but it is what it is, man. You know? Certain things have come to light, man.<br /><br />Lebowski Fest ... is what happens when people fall in love with something and go to extremes for the sake of carrying out a dream, so to speak. It's a worthy event and a lot of fun. I've been twice so far, when it was organized in Los Angeles and I had a blast. Jeff Bridges played on stage the first time and David Huddleston (The Big Lebowski himself) screamed `The Bums Will Always Lose' through the overhead PA at the Cal Bowl lanes in Lakewood, holding fast to a White Russian. Good times are sure to be had, and if you get a chance to go to Lebowski Fest, do so as it's one of the few great events that you can go to that you'll laugh from the first moment to the last minute. Lebowski fest is gearing up for their 7th Annual Fest in Kentucky where it all began.<br /><br />The disc could use more special features, it's been said. It would be good to hear more commentary and to see more footage and interviews, but maybe they'll put all that together for a 10th Anniversary edition this year, who knows. Anything's possible, man. If you will it ...<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is an amazing film that seems to be one of these flukes of filming like Casablanca. While people worked hard to make it happen, no one knew that it would become what is has while they were hard at it. I'm incredibly grateful to the Coen Brothers for this as it is solid entertainment through and through and shouldn't be missed. If you didn't get the first time, just catch it again, later.<br /><br />\\"Shomer Shabbos!\\" -- Walter.t it is what it is, man. You know? Certain things have come to light, man.

0891419195|5.0|Having seen Ken Burns films on WWII and his mention of this book, I decided<br />to read it. I was not disappointed. Ordinarily I don't like works like this<br />but Sledge handled his on-the-ground experiences in the Pacific with simplicity<br />but with elequence. I was very impressed with the book, moved and sometimes<br />shattered by the bravery and determination of our troups. It makes for<br />exciting reading, if you're inclined to know what war was like then, and<br />probably what war is still like for men and women on the ground now. Read it!<br />You won't be disappointed.

B00133KFGW|5.0|It took me about an hour to come down from the high I was feeling when I walked out of the theater.  Even though I already knew how it ended I wanted to see it again immediately.  I got the soundtrack as soon as I could and I'm listening it to it right now!!!!  I listen to it a couple of times a day.  NO LIES!!!!!!!!!!  I never buy movies, for real, but I knew the minute I walked out the theater door that I would have to buy this one!!!!!!!!!!!!  Don't miss it!!!!!!!!
B000YM4I4S|3.0|This is an interesting set of discs,possibly more of curiosity value than a primary recommendation for these symphonies.  Chailly made an earlier recording of these works for DECCA,but with the concertgebouw orchestra and in Schumann's own orchestration.Listening to these discs I am not at all sure that Mahler knew best in this case.  My own view is that the enterprise excellently charts the current state of the relationship between the Leipzig orchestra and its music director and showcases the now apparently revitalised orchestra's marvellous playing aided by a typically lucid DEECA recording. I think that these discs should be purchased as an ADDITION to an existing first choice,but NOT a first choice itself
B0010ZR160|5.0|Excellent movie from start to finish. This is my first time seeing Casey Affleck and I think I enjoyed his acting more than any of Ben's - They are so different! I love Morgan Freeman; He never disappoints. A movie to watch again and again!
B000056BOR|5.0|Doris Day and Cary Grant shine in this exceptional classic.  He plays a millionaire, and she an innocent out of work mess.  When the car Cary is riding in splashes her clothes, they meet and a comedy of errors follows.  The locations like Bermuda were wonderful choices for Day's fall from grace.    No one can compare to a Doris and Cary pairing, but Gig Young and Audrey Meadows compliment them well.  Gig Young steals scenes on many occasions.  It was also very nice to see some the Yankee players that are part of history.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I will only drop one spoiler: They bring the Replicators back in a way that is authentic to the plot, but still sucks.    They do conclude the Ori plot. They do it in a typical SG1 style. A lot of people are griping about the Ark (the object itself) but finding ancient artifacts that do cool things (lets call it military archaeology) is what SG1 has been about from the beginning.    The trips through the Gate were funded with finding this kind of stuff as its primary directive (\\"find technologies to defend Earth\\") and of course isn't this sort of thing exactly what the Gate itself is???    The movie deals in the series' motifs (I would have been disappointed if it had not and tried too hard to be something else): ancient artifacts, space travel, free will, good vs. evil, politics...    If only they'd have left the Replicators back in Season 8 where they belong!
B000VR824S|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband who loves guitar music. A friend told him he should buy it and we weren't disappointed. It is truly an awesome listening experience. All the bands on this are truly some of the greatest around, and B.B. King is the best. If you love guitar rock and blues this is truly a must buy item. I have just purchased the 2004 DVD but haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. Can't wait until we get the time. Extremely fantastic viewing and listening.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is a must have.  Weird, wild, crazy, entertaining to say the very least.  Very dark humor and a fine start in the \\"Six Foot Under\\" concept, with the fine acting of Michael.

0307346617|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I started reading this novel by Max Brooks, supposedly an oral history of the massive and highly destructive war between Zombies and the human race in the not too distant future. All I knew was I needed a break from writing legal briefs. Was it going to be a written and graphic version of a George Romero movie (he being no slouch in the Zombie department)?  Instead, I found quite an innovative and quite well written tale manifesting just an enormous amount of research and thought by the author. Undoubtedly, his prior book, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide,\\" allowed him to really probe this topic and conceptualize the plot for this novel.  To be sure while there is plenty of gore, the story--told in usually fairly brief interview formats--focuses on geopolitical, military weapons technology, medical, strategic, tactical, governmental, and many other dimensions.  I mean this novel was not cranked out in a weekend or two....it reflects a tremendous amount of thought and research.  On top of this, Brooks, who has quite an interesting writing background (including a stint on SNL) just writes superbly. Dare one say this is the \\"thinking man's\\" Zombie horror tale.  I found it quite gripping all the way through, with many shades of issues developed throughout--and does it move along through its 335 or so pages. I guess the book demonstrates that a skilled and dedicated novelist can take any topic, no matter how bizarre (and Zombies are plenty bizarre!)and turn it into a first class book.    Private note to Max Brooks:  We too all loved \\"Mrs. Robinson\\"
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Gave this to my favorite friend's grand daughter for Christmas.  It was an instant success and is a mainstay of every Christmas visit since then.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I think the production of the movie was quite good and I enjoyed it as a fan of the series and for the story.    However, the dvd tranfer is horrible.    The transfer is so noisy and full of mpeg artifacting that it becomes visibly distracting and really takes away from the story.  It is also the only DVD title I own that will not play on the PS3 (I used my regular DVD player to play it).  They should have done a better job of mastering this DVD but it was clearly not a priority and unfortunately the production suffers from the poor quality.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|They are the best at what they do.  this CD will get a lot fo use.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|This is hands down one of the best Blu-Ray transfers I have seen so far.  The video is crisp and clean with no visible artifacting. The audio is clear and defined with super nice bass.  I would have to say I was really impressed with this BD.  It was a pleasure to watch this movie again.    I was dissapointed in only one regard and that was that this was not the extended directors cut (it is just the regular theatrical cut).  I think that if the producers would added the Directors cut to this it would have really made this disc a 5 star!
0316779237|4.0|This is the first David Sedaris book I've read and I loved it.  The stories had me crying because I was laughing so hard.  I didn't laugh as much with the last 2 stories but they still made me chuckle.  I really enjoyed Sedaris' sarcastic humor and the way he left me wanting to read more of his books.  I plan on buying the rest of his books on my wish list!
0684865130|5.0|Set in the closing months of WWII, [[ASIN:0684865130 Catch-22: A Novel (Simon & Schuster Classics)]] follows Yossarian, a bombardier who has decided that everyone is trying to kill him.<br /><br />This book is not just a military satire, it's focus is much bigger that that. This book shows the obscene craziness of our world, each character another aspect of human nature.<br /><br />This novel gets better every time I read it and it's message is still an important one today.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet... what are you waiting for?
0060090367|4.0|I ordered this book, as one of my first in chick lit. Others in the same order were \\"confessions of a shopaholic\\", \\"just friends\\", \\"asking for trouble\\", \\"something borrowed\\" and \\"can you keep a secret\\". Ok, I think Sophie kinsella rocks. I've read the \\"undomestic goddess\\" a year ago and loved it. I also liked both of the above books. \\"Something borrowed\\" was a wonderful surprise, I loved it more than any of the rest. I hated \\"just friends\\" and was so and so about \\"asking for trouble\\". Well, Watermelon was much better than the last two but not a five star like \\"Something borrowed\\".<br /><br />It is the story of a woman that gets jilted by her husband right after delivering her first baby and goes back home (Ireland) to recover. She meets a nice guy there, named Adam, and starts to get over it and rebuild her life. Just as things start to fall into places, her husband comes  asking for her to come back. At this point she starts to reevaluate her life and marriage, following her husband's revelation about his reasons for leaving her.<br /><br />Though the story might not seem the most lighthearted you've read about, believe me the book is written with humour. I really liked it and didn't feel depressed at any time. I liked very much her writing style and I'm certainly going to buy more books of Marian Keyes in the near future.<br /><br />What I didn't like is the fact that Adam (the guy she meets when in Ireland) is more of an accessory to Claire than a real person by himself. The descriptions about him are skim and mainly on the external side. I would like to know more about him and his thoughts and see him in more pages. The whole book is more of a self discovery journey for Claire than a romance novel, the later being what I was expecting when ordering it.<br /><br />All in all, a good and entertaining read and nicely written. I would give 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. I hope Lucy Salivan is getting married to be more on the romance side than this.
B000002BQK|5.0|Can I say first off that I am so happy to see Mariah Carey back on top.  I have been a fan of Mariah since I was like ten years old and my undying devotion to her continues even today.  Despite a few missteps (`Glitter' for one) she has bounced back even though at times it looked as though the Mariah I once loved was no more.  Now she looks better than ever, sounds impeccable and is without doubt the recording artist that many should still aspire to become.  Her success is undeniable and her presence is felt strongly in everything she touches.<br /><br />Now that I got that out of the way let's talk about `Butterfly', one of my favorite albums she's ever released.  This album was released when I was thirteen (ha, I feel so young right now) and I remember listening to the album over and over for months.  A lot of him initial love for this album has to do with that infectious first single `Honey' and that jaw dropping music video, but that track aside `Butterfly' is a phenomenally complete album that delivers everywhere.<br /><br />I'll start by singling out Mariah's hip-hop influenced R&B tracks.  `Honey' is obviously a highlight and one that quickly comes to mind, but there are a few tracks here that surpass that impeccable single.  `The Roof' immediately gets under your skin.  The beat is infectious and just makes you want to move.  This is pure R&B brilliance that never gets old and serves as one of the best tracks on the album (check out the remix with Mobb Deep; also fantastic).  Another masterful track is `Breakdown' featuring Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone of Bone Thug's in Harmony fame.  This is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The beat is beautiful to listen to and Mariah and the `Thugs' have great chemistry together.<br /><br />Mariah also offers some silky smooth tracks designed to get that mood set (you know what mood I'm talking about).  `Fourth of July' attempts this, but isn't as successful as the intoxicating `Babydoll'.  `...July' is not a bad track but it's not that memorable a track.  `Babydoll' on the other hand is utterly unforgettable.  Dripping wet with blatant sensuality, `Babydoll' never fails to get me in that zone.  Mariah is truly irresistible.<br /><br />Ugh, now I have to listen to this song; hold on a minute...<br /><br />Okay, I'm back now.  What's the one thing that automatically comes to your mind when you hear the name `Mariah Carey'?  Power ballads!  Well, one of the many things that come to your mind, but Mariah is undoubtedly known for her wide range of uplifting and inspiring power ballads, and `Butterfly' is not without.  Take the title track for instance.  `Butterfly' is a beautiful addition to the album, a truly personal song that brings me close to tears (I can't really stand the reprise, in fact I loathe it, but whatever).  Mariah teams up with Bryan McKnight (another definitive voice in the R&B world) on the beautiful `Whenever You Call'.  The song is so soul touching, powerful and moving.  The two of them beautifully compliment one another.  Mariah also teams up with Dru Hill on the Prince cover `The Beautiful Ones', and while I much prefer McKnight to Hill I must say that Dru matches Mariah masterfully and delivers a truly mesmerizing rendition of this classic song.  `Close My Eyes' takes Mariah back to her roots and she delivers, beautifully.  `Outside' is a great way to close the album.  It's not the strongest track here but it's beautifully done to say the least.<br /><br />And I know it looks like I missed one, but I haven't; I'm just saving the best for last.<br /><br />By the best I am obviously talking about `My All', one of the best ballads ever recorded, not just by Mariah but by any recording artist.  The Spanish guitars beautifully compliment Mariah's vocals, which reach magnificent heights on this mesmerizing track.  If ever there was a song to capture pure brilliance, unfailing greatness and uncanny talent then this is that song.  Just listen to those octaves as the song closes; orgasmic.  If you can think of any recording artist who can match Mariah's voice I beg of you to share.  Yes Whitney is wonderful, but even she is no Mariah (that'll cost me some `helpful' votes).<br /><br />So, in closing, I must reiterate my sheer gladness in Mariah's triumphant return to the world of music.  Memories of her glory days will always ring in my mind, `Butterfly' being one of those glorious albums she released, and I hope to see much more in her future.  This album is truly one of the many reasons I adore this girl; err, um, woman.  If you are new to Mariah (who is `new' to Mariah?) then this is the album you must purchase to introduce yourself to this magnificent artist.  If you are a longstanding fan of this amazing talent then obviously you can mirror my admiration for `Butterfly', quite possibly her most impressive album to date.e song closes; orgasmic.

B00005JPTK|1.0|My first review with amazon begins with the I Am Legend movie 2 disc DVD set.  Let me start by saying first, that the one star rating is NOT for the movie itself.  Rather, it is only for the horrendous DVD presentation package.  What do I mean?  Read on. I did enjoy the movie when it came out in theaters and was highly anticipating it's release on disc, mainly so I could see all the bonus stuff and hear commentary on the film.  So of course I bought the 2 disc set, popped it into my player at home and...where the **** is my commentary?!  Oh, there is none.  Well that makes sense given there were several key parts of the film that the director could have elaborated on including why he choose to make an alternate ending (but we'll get to that in a minute).  I see on the disc it says to insert into your computer DVD ROM drive to enjoy all of the bonus material.  First of all, since when do I need a computer drive with internet connection to review bonus movie material on a DVD?  Second, if you don't have WIndows XP you can't watch it on your computer either! What ******* genius thought that up.  If I'm blowing $22 out of my pocket then I should be able to put any of these discs in my regular DVD player and just watch the extras.  And now, onto the alternate ending.  On the one hand I had fun watching it because it showed more of the Darkseekers.  On the other hand, the director definitely was right in not choosing this ending for the theatrical release.  It was too cliche and digressed too much into zombie love story (undoing Neville's theory that the creatures are no longer capable of human behaviors)implying that now he's going to give up searching for a new cure.  It just didn't flow well with the rest of the movie's themes.  But like I said I got a kick out of it.  The other problem with this alternate ending being put on a seperate disc, is that it would have made lots more sense to just have the original movie on the first disc (WITH COMMENTARY) and have the bonus features on the second disc along with the alternate ending as a deleted scene since it was the only thing different about the movie.  Why give me a copy of the same movie twice just because the last three minutes are different.  So overall:  The movie: I enjoyed it. I'd say about four stars.  The DVD presentation:  PPPHHHHBBBBTTTTT!!! RRIIIIIPP OOOOOOFFFFF!!!! Just buy the single release disc for $13 bucks or whatever it is and save the rest of your money for a DVD release with a proper set up.
B00004Z459|3.0|Who ever thought that when Linkin Park pounced onto the scene they would become the huge success they are today?  I surely never imagined they would become a household name.  I remember when I first heard of them.  A friend and I were at a local venue that housed small bands trying to make a name for themselves and Linkin Park just happened to be there.  I thought they were great. They had amazing energy on stage and their music was right up my ally.  A few months later I got my hands on a sampler CD sporting their first single `One Step Closer' as well as `With You'.  The studio was kind to them.  They sounded great cleaned up.  Then their debut album `Hybrid Theory' (which ironically was the original name of the band) dropped and suddenly the world belonged to Linkin Park.  Like Limp Bizkit before them, Linkin Park took the teen scene by storm and became the band everyone who was `cool' had to be listening to.  Unlike Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park's frontmen are not as insanely annoying as Fred Durst and thus their success has yet to fade.<br /><br />That said; this is the start of it all.  `Hybrid Theory' is the album that marked the beginning of something really big, and while it's not their finest album it serves as a great introduction to what these guys are capable of doing.<br /><br />`One Step Closer' was a great choice for a single.  The chords are simple yet exciting and the lyrics are angry and aggressive.  Chester and Mike feed off one another very well, but what you'd never guess from this single is the fact that Mike Shinoda is actually an extremely good lyricist.  Just listen to the opening track `Papercut'.  Shinoda spits fire over a hip-hop influenced rock beat while Chester bellows out the chorus lines.  Another great example of this duo working well together is `A Place for My Head', which is quite possibly the best song this band has ever done.  The beat is sic and the song just feels complete.  The `reanimated' version is even better.  Their most famous single is probably `In the End', a subdued rap track where Mike lets his rhymes slowly drip from his lips over pounding bass line.  `With You', `By Myself' and `Forgotten' follow more of a rock structure musically but continue to feature Mike's rapping as the dominating vocals.  They don't work as well as the others and somewhat seem to mesh together.<br /><br />Then Linkin Park decides to let Chester have some spotlight recognition.  Like on `One Step Closer', Chester takes the reigns on songs like `Points of Authority' and `Runaway'.  `Points of Authority' was never a real standout for me.  Chester sounds great, but the song as a whole is not that impressive.  The `reanimated' version is far superior.  `Runaway' is a decent track, nothing phenomenal, but well constructed.  Then we have `Crawling', one of the tracks that made Linkin Park as widely acclaimed as they've become.  The song is utter perfection.  It's delicate in parts, distressed in others, yet it all comes together beautifully.  The last track on the album, `Pushing Me Away', also serves as a highlight of the album for me.  It's the softest track here but it works extremely well for the band.<br /><br />Then you have `Cure for the Itch', which serves as a decent yet unimpressive intermission.<br /><br />The album is far from brilliant, but it is entertaining and it marks the start of a band that continues to grow.

B000ZN802W|1.0|I was born and currently live in Fairbanks, Alaska.  I know how harsh this environment can be from experience.  I watched this DVD with my grown son and his wife and we were all uneasy after seeing it.  Knowing the ending because of the true-life story, we were watching it to try to determine just when the main character went off the tracks, or to put it more bluntly, when he lost his mind.  If all the things he did and did not do are accurate, then we believe that he was nuts a long time before the events of the movie took place.  Number 1:  Who in their right mind throws away (or destroys) money, when it takes so much to live nowadays?  Number 2:  Were his parents really that bad, because if they were just the average disfunctional family, they are going to have to live with their son's assessment of them until they leave this planet, because he is no longer around to change his mind.  And Number 3:  No one should take Alaska lightly - it's a big state, mostly sparcely populated, with an evironment you must respect or else (see what happens to the main character).  Sean Penn and the actors all did a great job, but the whole story is just stomach-wrenching.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre has been always been my favorite novel.  I read when I was 14 and fell in love with character Jane Eyre ever since.  This Jane Eyre (Masterpiece Theatre 2006) with the excellent cast Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens is the closet portrayal of the book.  I've seen 4 different versions of Jane Eyre's adaptations, and this one is my favorite.  That's the reason why I bought the DVD from Amazon to keep for my own and I still watch it over and over again.  Ruth Wilson is more than perfect in her portrayal of Jane Eyre.  Her acting is beyond excellent.  Her facial expression and her feelings and vulnerability reflect from her eyes that tell you what she thinks and how she feels more than any words can describe.  Ruth Wilson got it all in this role of Jane Eyre, the kindness, the simple beauty, the patience, the intelligence, and the complex emotion of Jane Eyre that you can see all in Ruth's acting.  Toby Stephens has also given a very well-acted and compassionate character of Mr. Rochester.  This version explains more the reason why Mr. Rochester is unhappy and makes you feel sorry for him and makes you urge to see the united between him and Jane Eyre.  The romance through out the script is also the best compared to other versions.  With beautiful sceneries, details that can describe the situation, the characters, and the atmosphere without narration, and the compassionate performance of Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens have made this Jane Eyre version the best.  I can only simply say that I LOVE IT!
B000H2MF2C|1.0|A total mismash of observations, half baked philosophy, unstructured paragraphs, pointless dialogue. Waste of reading (or listening) time.  I read this after rereading Philip Roth's Zuckerman books. Perhaps that was a mistake. Roth lives and creates life on the page. DeLillo is off in some never never land of his imagination. It does not relate to human experience. It is artificial posturing, meant to shock, but ends up boring.    I recommend you get works by Roth, Updike, Bellow, Richard Ford, Ruth Rendel, among others. Even formula writers like Robert Parker and John Mortimer are more stimlating and fun.
0316010669|5.0|Throughout the novel Gladwell uses different studies, and stories to back up his beliefs, and ideas. This adds the element of reading a non-fiction book, yet Gladwell's descriptive ability, and ability to add a light tone to his research, and findings add a fictional side to the story. Gladwell does bring up many interesting topics throughout the novel, like the topic of thin slicing. I found it fascinating how many times our gut instincts are really our unconscious surveying a situation, and deciding on an opinion, or side to take. This did add much insight into my life, and allowed me to survey situations that are presented to me with new eyes.         The topic that I found most interesting in this book was when Gladwell mentions how the majority of the time people have race preferences toward white people over black people. I later took the racial preference test and found that I too have a strong preference of blacks over whites, which I found amazing, and at the same time very eye opening.         The topic that fascinated me the most about this book was when Gladwell talked about facial expressions, and how they, unlike verbal communication, can show someone's true feelings. Also how there was one man, Silvan Tomkins, who could easily decode and decipher anyone's facial expressions, and figure out their true personality, who inspired me.         Since this book is an easy read, it was not hard for me to understand many of the topics that Gladwell covers throughout the book, like the topics that I mentioned above. Gladwell does describe and inform the reader thoroughly about each topic, and he provides many different real life situations where each topic can be applied, which makes this book fun and interesting. I enjoyed reading this book, and I am sure that many others have too; it will bring much insight and understanding into your life, as it did mine!    - Avery O'Hara
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|my god what a movie. it this generations godzilla. i love the fact that you had a monster movie that did not have the big epic monster battles and huge amount of military trying weird and crazy ways to kill it. i heard that the monster was a infant that got seperated from its mother and thats why it was acting crazy.     godzilla 98 was the crappiest monster movie ever made with dragon wars in their to. cloverfield has put the fans of the monster films back in their seats. for its time godzilla 54 made in japan was the best and lasted in my opinion as the best all the way to cloverfield.     matt reeves and jj abrams made the best monster movie for this generation and maybe the next. i just hope when cloverfield 2 comes out in 2009 (rumor) it doesn't get corney like godzilla.    if jj abrams can make a 10 out of 5 stars movie like this i cant wait to see what he can do for the next star trek movie.    buy this movie you wont be disappointed

B000LC55F2|2.0|After hearing the praise from critics and the public alike, I decided to give the movie a try. After telling my father all the great thing I'd heard about the movie, and its considerably high position on IMDB, he decided to watch it with me. Well, he made it about 30 minutes through the movie, and left. I made it about an hour, maybe an hour and a half through the movie till I was too frustrated and confused to keep going.<br /><br />Story: I was so confused by the convoluted, confusing plot, I had to go to a myriad of sites with a full movie synopsis, to figure out what the heck was even going on. And even then, I was still out in the dark. So even though Christopher Nolan has never been one to make a simple plot, this one is way over the top. But wait, that's not all. This movie moves at a slower pace than most days watching C-Span. I mean good gosh, while this movie is at least a good two hours, it feels like you're watching a Peter Jackson movie. And the worst part is, you don't feel as if you spent your time wisely.<br /><br />Performances: Although the actors were good at portraying it, there was really only one emotion in the movie, anger. Not that hard to do. However, I was very surprised at the appearance of David Bowie as the character of Tesla, who I didn't even know existed till this movie.<br /><br />Mood: Very dark; Victorian London was never one for bubbling joy, but really, this is downright depressing. But, that's what this movie is going for, it's not supposed to be easy to swallow, or even fun, it's supposed to teach you a lesson, which I will get to in Morals. But, on terms of mood, the movie achieves what it's going after, and the amazing visual effects only compliment it even further. And again, Nolan knows how to create the mood he wants.<br /><br />Morals: Basically, the movie is about topping one another, and rivalries. And this is a rather bitter one, from crushing of birds, to wives dying, to trying to kill the other. By the end of the movie, you don't really care if any of them go, because they're acting worse than children. In fact, at times they're rather hateful, rageful, and use rather disturbing and strange ways to take their revenge. And of course, by the end, nobody wins.<br /><br />Overall: A very strange, confusing, slow, depressing movie, that really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Sure Christopher Nolan is good, at creating the mood of the movie, but it's not really a great mood. In fact, the number one mistake you can make in a story is you don't care for any of the characters. This movie only gives you more reasons to not like them. So if you like movies that only a critic could love, or you understand complicated story lines, or just like strange moral lessons, then this is the movie for you. For me at least, three words: Over The Top.y of them go, because they're acting worse than children.

B00005JPFH|4.0|Although I was horribly disappointed in the movie the first time around, watching it on DVD the second and third time around wasn't as bad as I remembered.  The movie had its flaws, but they were redeemable by the better parts.  Mostly.<br /><br />The special features were pretty pathetic.  I was truly hoping on some deleted scenes, but got left with some trailers, some pictures of the production designs, and a goof reel.  There were some others, but hardly worth mentioning.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun movie to watch, go for it.  If you are hoping for something with a little more plot, check out the original movie.

Coban's addictive voice and the backing vocals are backed by an appealing instrumental mix that including horns, fiddles, piano, violin, viola, mandolin, brass, accordion, strings and layers of percussion. The sound is cohesive and authentic, for a full impressive sound on these beautiful tunes. My favorites include In The Mausoleum, Cliquot, Nantes and the title track. The mood is introspective, even sad at times, but engaging throughout on this unique and remarkable album. Repeated plays are advised, as the album slowly releases its layers of sonic beauty.

B000FS9FCQ|2.0|Even though this movie had some good libertarian sentiments (\\"People should not fear their government, their government should fear the people\\") and it was delightful to me to see one of the Western world's greatest centers of tyranny get blown up (when will they do a movie about the War of 1812?), this movie's left-wing slant and political incoherence was just too much to bear. Apparently, when Fascism finally comes to Britain its main policy goals will be to outlaw homosexuality and Korans. Naturally, considering this script was written by the perverted Wachowski brothers and based on a comic book by the snake-worshipping degenerate Alan Moore, the guiding philosophies behind their fictional dictatorship is Christianity and conservatism. How utterly asinine. Everyone knows that the road to serfdom is paved with liberal intentions. Tyrannies usually come to power promising Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood, not limited government and an ethos of \\"Do Unto Others.\\"<br /><br />I'd like to see a movie about the thousands of Western European and Canadian men in prison for thought crimes against the Left, such as questioning the official version of the so-called Holocaust, for writing or speaking out against the homosexual agenda or opposing the immigration invasion of their countries. Who knows where such left-wing oppression will end? A Reign of Terror, a Gulag? I look forward to the day when government will start to fear the people, but by diverting attention from the real enemies of freedom, this movie only makes that day more unlikely.

Coban's addictive voice and the backing vocals are backed by an appealing instrumental mix that including horns, fiddles, piano, violin, viola, mandolin, brass, accordion, strings and layers of percussion. The sound is cohesive and authentic, for a full impressive sound on these beautiful tunes. My favorites include In The Mausoleum, Cliquot, Nantes and the title track. The mood is introspective, even sad at times, but engaging throughout on this unique and remarkable album. Repeated plays are advised, as the album slowly releases its layers of sonic beauty.
B0012QE4QC|2.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" charts the story of the fortunes of Mary Boleyn (Johansson) - Anne's (Portman) less famous younger sister - in her earlier bid for the affections of King Henry VIII (Bana). It also covers the major points of Anne's relationship with the avaricious monarch, as he divorces himself both from his barren-yet-faithful wife Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), and the Roman Catholic Church.     Good points first: the cinematography and production design in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" are stupendous. There's a real sense of reserve and quietly simmering passion in the hazy lighting and dream-like camerawork, and the sets and costumes are duly lush and incredibly detailed. Visually, Scarlett Johansson is a great choice to play the innocent, buxom Mary Boleyn, and there are several moments where \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" looks like a moving painting, reminiscent of Vermeer or Holbein.     Unfortunately, almost every other element of \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is below-par, not least of which is a truly awful script. It's a kind of mishmash of faux-Tudor dialogue peppered with contemporary phrases so the audience can follow the story - but sadly, it's overdone and cheesy. And the movie's truncated running time means that major events of the film - such as Henry's discarding Mary for Anne or his divorce from Katherine of Aragon (a major event in European history) - are given the briefest of scenes depicting them, before the too-thin script takes off to cover yet more ground. There's no real sense of drama or danger anywhere in the movie.    And it's because of this poor scripting that Eric Bana doesn't get much to do: I'm still not sure that he was in love with either Mary or Anne Boleyn, such is Bana's one-dimensional and expressionless reading of one of History's most vibrant kings. Portman as Anne is alright, but she doesn't really capture the intensity or the ambition of this most forward-thinking of women in history - nor does she touch on the dangers of Anne'ssituation when her marriage to Henry begins to fail. And Scarlett Johansson comes off as a bored simpleton. Other cast notables include Kristin Scott-Thomas as the Boleyn Matriarch (yawn, she's not around for much of the movie), Mark Rylance as Daddy Boleyn (with one expression of less-than-fatherly concern slapped to his face for all of his scenes, this guy gets really boring really quickly) and David Morrissey as their uncle, the Duke of Norfolk (high camp in Tudor tights: this guy's been nominated for two consecutive Razzies - I'm not surprised, and he's not good).    All-in-all \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a one-dimensional romp through some dull acting and poor writing, saved from one-star hell by its beautiful appearance. You'd be better off with a few episodes of season 2 of \\"The Tudors\\" - high-camp soap opera that doesn't try to be anything else. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", sadly, is too high-falootin' to really recognise its own limitations, and it's in this pretension that the audience, once again, loses out.    Not recommended.    PS: For fans of the book: avoid this one. The book is one of my favourite novels, I've read it many times, and this movie by itself is bad enough - when compared to the book that spawned it, it's just plain rubbish.
B00005JPTK|3.0|The long in development I Am Legend is a flawed yet entertaining adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic horror novel, and while this is undoubtedly the best version of Matheson's work to be filmed (don't get me started on The Omega Man), the potential for what I Am Legend could have been makes it slightly disappointing.  Will Smith stars as military scientist Robert Neville, who very well may be the last man on Earth.  Along with his dog Sam, Neville searches for a way to save humanity, which has been reduced to a vampiric race after a cancer vaccine went awry three years earlier.  Where I Am Legend works is first and foremost with Smith, who is so good as the isolated, lonely, and desperate Neville that he alone will keep you glued to the screen.  Smith's performance ranks as one of his best, as sometimes we forget just how good an actor the man is, he reminds us again here.  The visions of a desolate, unpopulated New York City is also one of the film's strengths, offering some very impressive visuals.  Where I Am Legend fails however is with the directing of Constantine director Frances Lawrence, whose action scenes are made worse thanks to some surprisingly lacking digital effects work.  I Am Legend could really have been something special here, regardless of how much it departs from Matheson's book, but alas, it just isn't.  Still though, I Am Legend isn't bad one bit, and the alternate theatrical cut included in this two-disc set is even better than the regular cut.  All in all, I Am Legend is definitely worth a look whether you are a fan of Will Smith's or a fan of Matheson's work, but be prepared to start thinking of what could have been after the credits start rolling.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I saw the I am Legend, then started reading the book, Yes, the movie is nothing like the Book.  BUT the Movie is as good as the Book.  So see the Movie, then read the classic 1950's, I am Legend.<br /> Will Smith is at his best, Zombie are smart, the opening Scene is Awesome, Enjoy,I am Legend, I bought it yesterday. Awesome Blu-ray.....
0385338724|5.0|I love Kinsella's stand alone stories.  I am not a fan of the Shopaholic series but LOVE \\"Can you Keep a Secret?\\" and \\"The Undomestic Godess\\".  Remeber Me? was a wonderful story and a totally fresh way to write a rediscovery story.  Lexi has to discover her true self because she has lost any recollection of who she is.  I thought she was incredibly brave and intelligent about her choices.  She took a giant blind leap of faith when she finally had to choose for herself---and that when she finally found a way back to who she was.  Bravo Sophie!!!!  Can't wait for the next stand alone.
1416550518|5.0|in this lovely debut novel. \\"The House at Riverton\\" is a richly imagined, well-written tale of life in one of the grand houses of England in the pre- and post-WWI periods. Grace is a young girl who is sent up to the big house to take a \\"position\\" in service. In the tradition of \\"Upstairs/Downstairs,\\" Kate Morton recreates life in the servants' hall and in the rooms above. Grace is indoctrinated with the notion that some are born to serve, and others to be served; that it is a privilege to serve; and that one's status in life is based on the grandeur of the house one serves in. Grace meets the nieces and nephew of the master of Riverton, and watches as they grow up, enter society, and marry. Right at the beginning, Morton sets up the denoument--a talented young poet committed suicide on the estate, and a young filmaker is making a film about the tragedy. But we know from the beginning that there's another story.    I found myself thinking of \\"Remains of the Day\\" and \\"Atonement\\"--both wonderful novels (and films) about the shattering effect the world wars had on the English way of life. [[ASIN:0571225381 The Remains of the Day]]; [[ASIN:B00003CXC9 The Remains of the Day (Special Edition)]];[[ASIN:0099429799 Atonement]];[[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement (Widescreen Edition)]]. \\"House at Riverton\\" doesn't aspire to the same literary heights, of course, but it's still beautifully written. The characters aren't terribly compelling, and certain plot lines are a bit obvious, but Morton does a beautiful job of recreating a time and a place with meticulous detail and lavish description. She also manages to convince us of the loves and passions and fears of her characters without graphic sex, blood and gore, or bad language--a nice change!        I devoured this novel in a day of plane travel, and enjoyed every minute of it. It's an excellent read, and perfectly OK for a teen who won't be daunted by the book's length. Highly recommended!

1400079179|1.0|The single star that I give this book is for the action and adventure in the beginning which I liked. The reason that is the only star has to do with the boring made up descriptions about the Holy Grail that makes up the last two thirds of the book. It's just too much reaching and grasping for me.
3836503050|5.0|He wasn't the first but he was the best.  In terms of technique, taste and visual impact Gil Elvgren ranks as the modern day Rembrandt in the world of illustration of beautiful women.  He was my principal inspiration as I am a nationally published illustrator and am frequently called upon to paint beautiful girls in ads.  As a student at the University of Minnesota, majoring in studio art, my style and artistic goals were the pariah of most of the art faculty except the very best artist they had on the faculty staff.  He understood what I wanted to achieve and I never got less than an A in any studio class.  In my senior year I visited Brown & Bigelow Company in St. Paul, where I lived, and submitted samples to Clair Fry, the famous art director who commissioned Elvgren and many other top flight artists for their famous calendars.  It was then that I learned that none of these men were on staff but located across the country.  He loved my work and gave me great early advice as to how to get going in the commercial art business as they knew nothing about that at the U. of M.  I followed his advice and started my career which has lasted over thirty years.    Gil Elvgren was the best for the reasons I previously stated but in addition his work was always in good taste.  His girls were downright wholesome and \\"the girl next door type\\".  They often had the look of being unaware that they were being watched and were usually caught in somewhat innocent and private moments.  His work could never ever be termed salacious or perverse as so many of his later day copiers are. The art of the pinup, for the most part, has degenerated somehwhat since Gil Elvgrens day.  It probably started with the advent of Playboy and Penthouse magazine and their \\"foldouts\\".  As long as we have these wonderful retrospective books on artists like Elvgren the public will have the chance to see what great pinup art used to be by the absolute master of the genre.    For anyone interested in my contributions to this art genre my official website is [...] .

It's not the new guys fault,it's the story and lack of Bond like movie features(gadgets,etc). The \\"bad guy\\" is also really lame! Come on a leaky eye?!

B000069KE0|5.0|This album is possibly Chicago's best ever, and that's saying quite a bit.      Chicago was unusual in that they had a horn section in addition to the usual lead, rhythm and bass guitars and percussion.  Their lyrics were singable and understable, and their rhythmic and harmonic progressions were to die for.    I purchased my copy just for the \\"Ballet For A Girl From Buchannon\\" but the other tracks are well worth listening to as well.    Over the years, I've grown to appreciate much of the excellent rock and roll from the 60's, 70's and 80's.  Chicago has certainly stood the test of time, and this album especially so.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I had to purchase a second copy of this amazing CD...I wore the first one out playing it! I have all the music Nightwish has recorded that is commercially available, and listen to them frequently. While their first vocalist, Tarja, set them apart from others of their same genre (such as Within Temptation and Evanescence), their new vocalist is more than adequate and, though her range is a bit more limited, she has greater control of the notes. It is a real pleasure to listen to her. I'm looking forward to more music from this group. They write beautiful melodies, their lyrics make sense, and they are instrumentally outstanding. I highly recommend them to anyone ready for more than the standard fare.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I guess maybe the constant Radiohead references must be coming from people who haven't been listening to music for more than a decade. Muse may have a touch of [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]], but they have also undergone a little [[ASIN:B000VBIEXS Brain Salad Surgery]] and perhaps suffered a [[ASIN:B000000OAA Sheer Heart Attack]] or two. One thing is VERY obvious, however. Matt Bellamy and his band mates like big, theatrical, ambitious music. \\"Absolution\\" pulses and pounds, kicks and punches, demanding that Muse fill every nook and cranny of every available stadium in the world. There hasn't been a band this blatantly craving stardom since Billy Corgan brought on the Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />That is certainly not a bad thing. There are few bands around right now that seem to want to make heroic pomp-rock. \\"Absolution\\" is almost relentless in its velocity and desire to be as thorough as possible. Climaxing staccato synths? Check. Multi-layered falsetto harmonies? Check. Grandiose piano (on \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\")? Check. One quick forced ballad to ease the pressure? Check. Science Fiction and apocalyptic themes? All present and accounted for. While \\"Absolution\\" sounds like a billion other bands before it, Muse works this floor plan brilliantly and with flair. It lifts \\"Absolution\\" far above most of its ilk, which may be why those Thom Yorke comparisons seem so hard to dodge. One thing Radiohead is always good for is high ambition, and Muse brings it on as well.<br /><br />Perhaps the only fault here is that \\"Absolution\\" just seems to never let up. Best taken in small bites, this is a CD that shows Muse as ready to take on the world's stadiums. The good thing is that by the next album, [[ASIN:B000FVQYYK Black Holes and Revelations]], Muse forged into some new stylistic departures and created an album that sounded incredible from start to finish without feeling like a club to the skull. On the other hand, on those days when you want to fill your room with the sounds of a band that feels full enough of itself to fill a CD with every trick they've got and no subtlety whatsoever, \\"Absolution\\" is the disc for you.d that feels full enough of itself to fill a CD with every trick they've got and no subtlety whatsoever, \\"Absolution\\" is the disc for you.
B000002LSW|5.0|I almost never see a band from after the eighties  or sixties where there is not at least one song that's a filler worth skipping over. ZZ Top has a hit on every spot to listen to over again. My least favorites are Gun Love and Pretty Little Women, but no one should ever skip Rough Boy and Legs. Everbody's favorite is probably Viva Las Vegas, but it was from Elvis first. The absence of re-recorded or different versions of songs so present on most albums is so refreshing. I never get tired  of this music. Like maple syrup on pancakes, almost nobody can turn it down.
1400032717|5.0|Much has been made of how well Heddon has created the internal monologue of his protagonist, a 15 year old high-functioning autistic, and indeed he does a marvelous job. My background is in psychology, and the narrative struck me a extremely authentic. But this has, in many reviews, overshadowed the tremendously well-crafted story that is at the heart of this novel.<br /><br />Christopher, the narrator, begins by telling us a bit about himself, and how he tries to solve the mystery of a dog that he finds murdered on a neighbor's lawn. But the story of the dog is only, in the end, incidental to a greater mystery that he uncovers, one that changes his life, and that of those around him.<br /><br />What impressed me most was not how well Heddon recreates Christoper's internal monologue, but how he uses Christopher's limited perceptions and understanding of the world to let us see what Christopher cannot- the emotions and the motivations of the people around him. The result is really a very moving and poignant tale, all the more so because the hero is unaware of so much that we can see.
B0010358CG|5.0|Though written like the plot of a big budget video game, that is to say it has an obviously linear increase in the scale of the conflict from a skirmish to an \\"end boss\\", it does have some attempt at characterization that make  it worth  watching, and although you see the limitations of 3d animation in clunky robotic movements in the characters, the set design and action scenes really shine
6305212112|5.0|Excellent story protrayed by a cast of fine actors. The story line was  touching, delivered with humor and tenderness.

That's just several layers of stupid, smothered with goofball gravy.<br /><br />I also like the comment about Blu-Ray not being around in a year.  lol  Looks like you bought the wrong format TWICE - the first time being when you bought your HD-DVD player instead of a PS3. :)
B0013FXWVU|4.0|This is a really cute movie.  I enjoyed it and it's a movie that will appeal to any age group really.  I remember reading this when I was younger and it was great 'hearing' the story again.  Jim Carrey was perfect as the voice of Horton.  You can picture his face throughout the movie as he makes Horton talk.  Horton is in the jungle relaxing, and hears a teency cry for help coming from a speck of dust.  He discovers that the speck is home to the itty bitty town of Who-Ville.  Horton has a heart of gold who makes it his mission to protect the tiny people of the tiny town.    Carol Burnett plays the local jungle busy-body kangaroo.  The mayor is played to perfection by Steve Carell and befriends Horton.  They set out to find a safe spot for the speck to survive.    It's filled with gorgeous characters and clever lines and it was so enjoyable.  The humor is great throughout and the animation is terrific.  I highly recommend you going to see this whether you've read the book or not, or have kids or not, or are a kid or not.  It is fun for everyone.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|I´ve just receveid my box. The film is what is expected (are you a fan or not). What counts, however, are the gifts that accompany the film: the poster, cards, the extras on DVD, the script, the book of photos ... An item of collector.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a movie more in a long time than watching \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie.\\" Julie Andrews was just wonderful in this film as well as Mary Tyler Moore with the added bonus of Carol Channing playing Muzzy. I was browsing on amazon for any Julie Andrews movies and this gem came up. I had never seen or heard of this film, and after watching it was not dissapointed!     Set in the \\"Roaring 20's\\", Millie (Julie Andrews) whom is looking for a husband Trevor Graydon (played by John Gavin) goes and lives in New York city at an all girls boarding house run by Mrs. Meers (Beatrice Lillie) a front-lady for an oriental white slavery ring. Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore) leaves home to find \\"her way in the world\\" also comes to New York city and meets Millie at the same boarding house.  The two girls together create quite a pair in their zany, wacky ways in this madcap of a movie. The antics that happen will leave you falling off the couch with laughter!       This is a movie that the entire family would enjoy. It is funny, heart-warming, suspenseful, and thrilling. I would encourage anybody who wants clean, quality entertainment in their home to purchase a copy for their DVD library. It's a classic! Format: Color, Widescreen, 2hrs 32 min.

0743201140|1.0|My issue with the book is nothing to do with codes or upselling to other products.  It's the basic premise that I have a problem with and its lack of reality in the real world.    To a large extent I'm always slightly wary of books by people who have merely studied others and haven't really been out there at the coal face of human achievement but the hype for Mr Buckingham is huge so I thought I'd give it a go.  It reads very much to me like a wonderful and highly marketable theory that could only really work in a large company.  Most small enterprises would be ludicrously stifled if all their staff went around \\"only working to their strengths\\".  Sometimes to really make a difference and to really get things done you have to bully your way through your weaknesses too.  I doubt there is an entrepreneur on the planet who wouldn't agree with that.      Perhaps I'm viewing it from too entrepreneurial a perspective but I also take great solace in the fact that Tiger Woods regards one of his key skills as being his ability to work on his weaknesses.  At the time of writing Tiger looks like being the world's first sports billionaire and has just won seven tournaments in a row.  That's somebody whose advice I would take.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Unless I am totally missing it, this is going to be another bare bones 1 disk craptacular release. I assume by late summer or Christmas we will get the \\"REAL\\" release of this movie with a multiple disk version with tons of extras.     I have lost track of the number of movies I have had to re-buy because the delayed better version is always out later... Zodiac and Sin City are two recent ones that come to mind.     RARE is the sign that the movie studios actually care about our buying choices... like American Gangster and Master and Commander have had basic one disk versions out on the same day as the multiple disk deluxe versions.     Oh well...
B00005JPTK|1.0|I loved this movie.     This one star review is not a refelction of the movie itself, but of the DVD 'digital copy' feature. I wanted to get the 2-disc edition for the alternate ending, but the fact that it purported to have a  'digital copy' of the movie was icing on the cake... only to get it home and find out that the 'digital copy' is incompatible with my iPod, my iPhone, or my AppleTV.     If they are going to offer this feature, they ought to make it compatible with THE largest digital media platform, which is iTunes and its associated products. Don't rip off consumers by promising a 'digital copy' that doesn't work with anything. The point of having a digital copy is so that you can put it on digital devices OTHER than your computer. If I was going to watch it ON my computer I would just watch the DVD, or even better, I would just watch it on my television which is why I bought the DVD in the first place.

1591841666|1.0|Don't buy.  A brobdignagian waste of money.  It's not a book, it's an essay.  That is, it's extremely short.  Moreover, what little there is of it consists entirely of repackaged obviousness.  Repeated over an over in order to simulate an essay which should never have been a book.  In its entirety, it says only three things:     1. Things that are worth doing are hard  2. Not everything that's hard is worth doing.    3. It behooves us to figure  out the difference.    Who doesn't know this?
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I'm not going to review the music here, just the cover.  Why?  Because there are lots of other reviews for the music.  And this album cover is one of the best that I have seen in years (with the exception of Tool).  More bands should try for real art on their covers instead of taking the all-too-common Photoshop graphic design approach.
B000EBEHR2|4.0|Not having any other Placebo albums besides this one, I'm not going to try and persuade you with my stupid opinions. I normally give a track by track review but I just simply don't know Placebo well enough (I might make a better review later). To keep it short I'll put it this way: the first two songs Meds and Infra Red are very obvious singles and sound quite poppy. Then there is Drag and Space monkey which I think are amazing songs with great lyrics from Brian. Then Follow the Cops Back Home is a calm yet explict song that may have something against cops followed by Post Blue which is electronic and kind of poppy. Because I Want You is also a bit poppy.     After this it goes slightly downhill except for ballad Pierrot the Clown and the ender Song to say Goodbye which are also great songs. I'm not going to tell you whether you should buy this album or not, but if you want your curiosity to get the better of you; be my guest.
B000VBIEXS|3.0|I agree with other reviewers that the volume increases in Jerusalem and the Karn Evil part 1 is very muddy.  Also, the low end is too pronounced.  I felt like I was listening to gangsta rap.<br /><br />Seems like Shout spent too much time on the packaging...
0375842209|5.0|I had two people I trust recommend this in a two-week period, which means I got my butt to a bookstore. And I'm glad I did; this is an exceptional read, one of those sneaky books that distracts you with warmth while it sneaks behind and cuts your heart out. Vonnegut is the closest parallel I can think of, and that's not a name I drop lightly.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger is a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany. In an era when, using little but words and will, Hitler has remade a nation into a horrorshow, Liesel's chief comfort is found in the books she steals, as well as the friendships she forms in her working class neighborhood.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and did I mention the story is narrated by Death?

B0013FDM7E|1.0|One of the worst movies (Big Budget) I have seen!  Can we say BORING??  This movie is so slow with mummy like monsters and bad C.G..  Why this movie made money I don't know but I will tell you one thing... I will never see another Will Smith movie.  EVER..
B0010358CG|5.0|With so few anime movies made these days (and much less their CGI sisters), Appleseed: Ex Machina is a fresh addition to the sci-fi/ fantasy genre. But is it worth your time, effort and money? I will leave that decision to you. But I shall present to you my opinion.<br /><br />The one thing I loved the most about Ex Machina was the voice acting (eventhough the timing was a bit off at times). It has been done perfectly, right on top with the likes of FullMetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell. Luci Christian (although I am not too fond of her) does a wonderful job as Deunan, BTW you may remember her a Kaname Chidori from Full Metal Panic.<br /><br />A new character, Tereus bring a fresh look to the cast. You can view him as the human part of Briareos. I, sometimes, felt that director Shinji Aramaki could have dwelled more into Deunan's and Briareos's romance (same thing with the first movie). Battle scenes are awesome, as expected from John Woo. Character models look like plastic barbies sometimes, but other times, they will blow your brains out.<br /><br />Although, people will view this sequel as just a fan service to the original movie, I believe it is definitely worthy of being added to your anime collection. I cannot say anything about its DVD counterpart, but Appleseed: EX Machina (Blu-ray) on a 46\\" Bravia played on a PS3 with 5.1 surround sound at 1080p will make you wonder if there is anything else better in life.
B000022TSW|4.0|The first opening number you hear to this film makes you instantly suspicious. You see that it's so simple that you honestly suspect something randomly is going to happen half way through the song; but the song ends and what follows on in one of the greatest songs ever. Sung by Terrence and Phillip (Canadian actors) this song got the world record for the most swear words in one song (mainly being the F word). After this comes a film with pure hilarity, by far one of Kenny's greatest deaths and has as much gore and randomness as any other South Park episode only longer and told like a musical.     The only reason it loses one star is due to the lack od DVD extras. After playing the movie to death and wanting more out of the DVD I don't really care much for trailers of the film. And the only thing besides that is a music video for the song 'What would Brian Boitano do?' (I don't know who he is) and thats ashame because the movies great.     Well there's not much else to say besides buy it if you want to laugh yourself silly and end up humming the tunes everywhere for weeks.     P.S people who have watched the film already will react to your humming in two ways:     1. Start laughing and having a complete singalong with you for the rest of the day     2. Will be irritated at the very sight of you and start torturing you with a giant pile of chicken wings.

0307341550|5.0|I've never met her, but I bet Gillian Flynn is a really nice person. The folks who can most effectively warp your mind usually are.<br /><br />Many writers try to freak you out by shoving your face in horror, which is a lot like trying to turn someone on by lunging for their crotch. It might work on occasion, but it's not great technique.<br /><br />Flynn, on the other hand, moves slow and sure and creepy, teasing your darkness, stroking your wounds, burying fingernails just a little too deep. Her prose is gorgeous, and her characterization flawless. The story of a Chicago reporter who returns to her hometown to cover the murders of two young girls, at a glance SHARP OBJECTS looks like your standard mystery, but trust me, there's nothing typical about this one.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I have to start by saying I have not read the book and had no idea what the story was really about until I watched this. I saw the trailers and knew a bit, but certainly not the entire story. I really loved the tale, and the effects were brilliant (I didn't feel the 'monsters' were too cartoonish at all). I do wish we'd seen more of the struggle of the main character when everyone was dying though. The story seemed to be broken into three parts, and not much was done to tie it all together. We did see flashbacks, but not enough to satisfy. I felt the editing was really choppy. There were some glaring omissions or at least \\"what the heck\\" momemnts that were just stuck in there. (How did anyone reach the island? A boat? how did they leave--?? why were the cars so shiny? lol) There were little touches I really loved in the film; the \\"Shrek\\" obsession, the dog, etc.   The extras that show \\"out takes\\" prove to be really helpful and I think some should have been left in the movie. Will Smith was brillant in this flick,btw. Great acting. I've actually thought a lot about this film long after it's over, proving to me that it really was pretty darn good.

This cd along with honky dory, Ziggy, Pin-ups and Aladdin Sane were his best. After that, no more Ronson and nothing was ever as good. Bowie still had a lot of great stuff but something was always missing.

B0013FDM7E|1.0|I saw this movie the first day it opened and due to the fact that it had the same name of Matheson's book , I expected something closer to what the author intended than previous film versions . Instead it was the worst of all three movies based on the book . Plot holes galore ,  CGI effects among the worst I've ever seen in a film , an ending that looked tacked on and rushed , and a heavy religious theme , where none at all existed in the book made this movie a huge disappointment . It was so bad it would've flopped horribly had it not been for the superstar drawing power of Will Smith . If you must see it - rent don't buy !
0765348276|3.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" starts with a different take on the standard military sci-fi - the interstellar war is being fought by old people, 75 year-olds at the end of their life who sign up to - they hope - start over, young again.  The book follows widower John Perry as he joins, trains with, and fights for the army.    Given the setup the tone is usually understandably humorous, and Scalzi's technique is fine.  The book can't keep up its early solid pace, however; after Perry starts training, \\"Old Man's War\\" slips into generic territory and mostly stays there.  The R. Lee Ermey-esque drill sergeant, the gun battles with humanoid aliens, the standard ethical questions;  Scalzi plays them with a wink and a nod, but doesn't manage to make them interesting.  The drill sergeant may mock the idea that's he's straight out of central casting, but, well, so would one that was out of central casting.    One later plot thread works better, starting when Perry runs into the special forces of the \\"Old Man's War\\" universe, \\"The Ghost Brigades.\\"  Any detail would spoil things, but the idea and its consequences are fascinating to the extent they are explored in the book.  This is Perry's book, however, and the exploration of the Ghost Brigades is necessarily limited.    Old Man's War is still solid military sci-fi, and it's an enjoyable enough read, even if Scalzi's strengths are not in some of the more well-worn territory the book covers.

0452289963|4.0|[[ASIN:0979353505 Love's Secret Live Your Life in Love]]When we are in touch with our purpose in life it is easy to give and share love. Eckhart is a wonderful writer with an authentic voice of integrity. He is in touch with his purpose to awaken a New Earth to it's spiritual connection. Just like his book The Power of Now, in A New Earth, we are reminded to reconnect to our spiritual essence, and spend time in silence. As we deepen our connection to this spiritual essence we are guided to the path of our life's purpose.    I would recommend this book to anyone who is feeling overwhelmed with life and wanting to reconnect to their spiritual connection. Eventhough this connection cannot be found outside us, this book is an excellent guide to take you on your journey.
B000002L80|5.0|The Talking Heads have put out some great music in the 1980's up to the mid 90's but I think this album was when they reached a creative pinnacle in their melodic style. David Byrne has the kind of creative mind which produces lyrics and music in a unique way. Because their music was always considered obscure, even within their category, they tended to attract a sub mainstream audience. \\"Speaking in Tounges\\" was their first record to get noticed but even so, it was considered eclectic. Then \\"Stop Making Sense\\" (the movie) came out and mainstream was going to see it and buying Talking Heads recordings, followed by the soundtrack for \\"True Stories.\\"    What I like about it is that it's uplifting, fun, and energetic. The music makes you want to get up and dance. The words are sometimes weird, funny, and strong statements about our society. I've also put in some great driving time in our old Saab, listening to this CD. When it ends, you find the last hour seemed to go by quickly and you're almost there!

(Since I live in Florida, I may never get that chance).  After reading his book, I would love for him to have the chance to unite this country.    The book is divided by subjects in chapters that can be read individually.  In other words you don't have to read chapter by chapter, you can start where your interest lies.  He has a chapter on the Constitution, faith, family, race, values, etc.  He must have been an incredible constitutional law professor.   His other book, Dreams from My Father, is also very interesting.

B0011NVC9I|4.0|When I was in high school we had to read the story of Beowulf during one of my English courses, and it was required reading which meant I wasn't all that excited to get into the story. Now, I have to admit that based on what we read and how we did it in my class, it was done by group reading (which meant different vocal inflections that seemed to improve upon or possibly take away from what was being read aloud at any given time), I wasn't too impressed by the story, and had therefore forgotten most of it. So, when I read that acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis (\\"Castaway\\") was helming a film adaptation of the epic story, I was unexcited by the prospect. However, that attitude quickly changed when I saw the previews to the movie and was able to see just how cool they were making the story appear, and the digital effects employed to bring the live actors to life in a CGI way looked truly outstanding. Sadly, I didn't get a chance to see \\"Beowulf\\" in theaters, but I made sure that when the movie arrived on DVD that I added it to my ever-growing movie collection, even though I hadn't already seen it. However, before I rushed out to purchase the movie, I was a little unsure about just how much I would actually enjoy it. When it was initially released to theaters, the movie had received fairly mixed reviews from critics, some said it was terrific and mind-blowing, while others felt it was too fake and lacking drive and content; however, my friends and family that saw the movie all enjoyed it so I ignored the critics that hated it, and took a chance.    \\"Beowulf\\" is the story of a Danish kingdom ruled by King Rothgar (Anthony Hopkins) who finds both his kingdom and his people under attack by the monstrous Grendel (Crispin Glover). Hearing of the attacks and hoping to gain plenty of glory and reward, the heroic Beowulf (Ray Winstone) leads his band of warriors into battle in hopes of destroying the dreaded beast. After successfully ridding the land of Grendel, Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and her temptations of Beowulf may spell further disaster and despair for the kingdom and its newfound hero.    Wow, this was an extremely entertaining and action packed movie that grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't really let up until the very end. The story is full of action, suspense, some humor, and even a little digital nudity (which is kind of weird). The overall scope of the story seems pretty close to what little I do actually remember from reading it in high school; although I did read that for the most part, the details of the movie deviate to varying degrees from the original story, apparently director Robert Zemeckis wasn't too big of a fan of the original story and wanted numerous elements revised or removed.    The actors were all excellent in their individual roles, even though we never actually saw the real actors; their digital counterparts seemed capable and were given their motions through motion capture devices that were used with the real actors to record their actual movements. So, even though they never appeared on screen, their physical performances remained intact. Each of the digital actors closely resembled the actor that was playing the role, except for two of the characters whose outward appearances were drastically different from real life. The monster Grendel only had minute similarities to actor Crispin Glover (\\"Willard\\") that portrayed him, and Ray Winstone's (\\"The Departed\\") title character, Beowulf, was much leaner, muscular, and younger than the veteran actor voicing him and acting out his physical movements.    For some reason, and I can't really understand why, unless it's just a desire to push the envelope of technology further, director Robert Zemeckis has made two films in a row that featured all CGI versions of the actual actors he hired to play the parts. It's strange, that he takes this approach, because the actors still act out their roles, but instead of being in costume they have little motion capture devices stuck on various parts of their skin-tight body suits for the computers to record each of their movements and translate that into the CGI character that will be onscreen. Zemeckis' first attempt at an all CGI enhanced live-action movie was the incredibly boring \\"The Polar Express\\" starring Tom Hanks. The technology was pretty impressive when that film was made a few years ago, but the actors did look a little zombie-like because their eyes didn't have any semblance of life to them, and their facial expressions seemed wooden. For \\"Beowulf\\" the technology seems to have advanced by leaps and bounds in the overall physical performance of the characters, the movements seem less wooden; although there are a few times where certain movements look oddly stiff, but the biggest improvement was made in the faces of the characters. Gone are the zombie-like, almost dead eyes, and the stiffly unimpressive facial expressions, and in their place are lifelike faces that in some instances could easily fool someone into believing it was the actual actor onscreen and not a digital counterpart.    As much as I enjoyed \\"Beowulf\\" I did have one minor gripe with the movie. The movie boasts such impressive action and suspense that it feels like you hardly get a chance to catch your breath, which is fine with me, I enjoy it when a movie seems to move at break-neck speed. However, there is a point in the movie where I guess the writers, or maybe it was the director, wanted to kind of slow down the proceedings just a little bit, possibly out of fear that they may be losing their audience by going too quickly (though that was not the case in my experience). When this slower moment hits (occurring shortly after Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother) it feels strangely out of place, and really drags the movie down for its entire five or ten minute span, however long the breather in the pacing actually lasted I'm not entirely sure, but thankfully the respitewas mercifully short and the movie's pace picked right back up as if it had never slowed down one iota.. I don't know why that down time occurred in the movie, and maybe that was one part from the original story that actually remained in the picture, which may explain why it felt different from the rest of the movie, but director Robert Zemeckis seemed to have no problem getting the movie to regain its momentum, and the rest of the movie proceeded along as if that brief low point had never happened.    The visually stunning film \\"Beowulf\\" is a thoroughly entertaining and action-packed epic thrill ride, which I believe captures the essence of the original story of Beowulf, while giving it a somewhat modern polish that makes for an incredibly enjoyable movie experience.    \\"Beowulf\\" is available in PG-13 and unrated editions both contain violence and brief nudity.
B000002UB6|4.0|A very nice album, but knowing what they were going through during it, I find myself putting it alongside \\"Double Fantasy\\" in that it hurts my heart to listen to it sometimes.  Kind of like a death in the family, and the fact that most of the cover is black is not lost on me.    However, if the Beatles had decided NOT to release \\"Let It Be\\", just think of what Paul McCartney's first solo album could have sounded like!!  You'd have \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Every Night\\", \\"Teddy Boy\\", along with \\"Let It Be\\", \\"Get Back\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Two Of Us\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\"....geez....what a first solo album!!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|The Sony MDR7506 has not disappointed.  Though not a professional musician of any type, I like clear, crisp sound and reliable headphones.  I did a fair amount of research via the internet, and the Sony seemed solid.  I use the headphones almost exclusively with my iPod Nano -- easy and efficient.  The cushioning over the ears is comfortable and never heavy except after hours of wearing.  The cord is extremely long and I often have to throw it over my back when wandering around the house -- they're made for more professional use, I suppose.  But I am more than happy with the Sony MDR7506 and would easily recommend.
0521824362|5.0|This is one volume in the complete series of Austen's novels published by the Cambridge University Press.  The series is undoubtedly the best one to own by anyone who is more than casually interested in the great author and her work.  The introductions are flawlessly helpful to whatever detail of background the reader wants.  The notes explain references and changed or obsolete word usage and are easily skipped by anyone who doesn't want them.  The texts of the novels are the most accurate scholarship can now produce.  They are mostly the same as in the OUP edition of the novels, but much easier to read because of the typeface chosen.  The series also has juvenilia and the unfinished text of \\"Sanditon,\\" omitted from the OUP edition.  In the end, I cannot praise the Cambridge series too highly.

0061122416|2.0|For many years I have been told to read this book. After I saw it for half price I decided it was the time. I was excited to read what could be one of the best books I ever had. I expected this because the book has tremendous hype. The truth is that I wish I would have loved it, but I found it boring, empty, and repetitious; so I found myself speeding through it just to get it over with. The book has maybe 3 exciting spots that last at most 2 pages out of 165 pages.  Many of the things the book tries to teach are things that any person with what the book calls a \\"Personal Legend\\" can derive for themselves, from just living. The metaphors are empty, and repetitious. I found myself rolling my eyes every time I read a corny metaphor.   If you have an analytic mind I wouldn't recommend reading this. This book is meant for people who live life on solely a spiritual level, and believe in life's signals.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I'm not gonna say this is Quentin at his best, in fact, I think Pulp Fiction is way more enjoyable than this.  But, 98 1 star reviews?!!  Are you serious?  What did Quentin do that was so different in this film than all his others?  I found the dialogue no more forced in Death Proof than in Reservoir Dogs or Kill Bill.  I've gotta admit that the second half of Death Proof is more likable than the first, the second group of girls are better actresses in my opinion and their dialogue seemed to be written better.  But come on, the way the first group of girls exit the film...it's the best crash I've seen in any movie.  I say give this a chance, don't expect Kill Bill 3 but DO expect lots of talking.  Who knows, maybe if you *gasp* sit back and pay attention to the \\"Blah Blah Blah\\" you may like it.    *Death Proof might not deserve a 5, but I know it doesn't deserve a 1.*

B00000BKE1|4.0|In 1990 Iron Maiden released \\"No Prayers For The Dying\\",an attemp to return to their roots which resulted in one of the band's worst album(Adrian Smith has said he left because he wasn't happy with the direction the band was taking,he did not participate in any way to it).Two years latter they return to a more traditionnal style for 1992's \\"Fear Of The Dark\\",obviously better than its predecessor.Fear Of The Dark was released without much promotion and at the time Grunge music had pretty much destroyed everything so there wasn't a lot left directionwise.Maiden still released an album true to themselves and managed to produce a few great songs with FOTD.Most fans were unhappy with the direction they took with their previous album and this one receved a better treatment from them.Fear is heavy,has the band being themselves and has some good songs and playing.<br /><br />Fear would be the last album with Bruce Dickinson until 2000's \\"Brave New World\\" as he wouldn't return until 1999(Smith also rejoined with Bruce).You need to understand that there was a lot of tentions back ten in the band between Bruce and Maiden,so it was kind of Bruce versus Maiden in some ways.It's a band with a signer that they don't want there and a signer who doesn't want to be there either.It wasn't the best era of Maiden.The band would go on tour during 1992-1993,then record two live albums and Bruce would go on to make solo albums while Maiden would get a new singer,Blayze Bailey who would make two albums with them.The band wasn't fonctionning as a unit anymore it was the band in one side and Bruce in the other and let's face it,in those circumstances it is really hard to be committed at 100 % and do your best and give something great to your fans.It is also hard to pretend to your fans that everything is alright when you know inside it isn't.<br /><br />The album opens with what is possibly the best song on the album,\\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\",it is one of the classics on the album and its heavy and fast!Bruce's voice is different on this track he seems like he's posessed,some of his best singing.The following track \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place\\" has Maiden trying to sound too much like AC/DC(should have been on Bruce's solo album),the video for this was a minor hit back then but I still don't like the song even today.Track number three \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\" Is one of the shining tracks on the album.A slower paced song with some good group-chorus singing,the transition from ballad mode to heavy mode is fantasic.One of my favourites here.\\"Fear Is The Key\\" has to be the darkest song on the album,im not really a fan of that one.\\"Childhood's End\\" is underrated.A great track with a great feeling,Nicko does some great drumming here and the lyrics are very good,great song people.\\"Wasting Love\\",a ballad,yeah for real!Pretty good at what it is too,it depends wheter or not you can handle ballads truly.\\"The Fugitive\\" is excellent and underrated also,a more classic Maiden style song,not much more to say on this one.\\"Chains Of Misery\\" is not one of the songs I like on the album.\\"The Apparition\\",a love it or hate it song,I am in the middle.\\"Judas Be My Guide\\" follows up,its pretty solid I don't have a lot to say on that one,its good.\\"Weekend Warrior\\" is one of the most hated Maiden songs of the album if not ever.The title track \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" closes the album,it is amongst the best tracks of the album and is runner up for THE best one.Slow at first then it gets heavy and Bruce shines here,great chorus too.<br /><br />Overral \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" is not their most classic and memorable album but it does have some classic songs that are really good and worth checking out.If you are a fan you should get this as a portion of the album at least will please you.Not the best but not the worst,if you are new to the band this isn't the first album you should get.Fear shouldn't be skipped it has some gems on it that you WANT to hear!I have their albums and this is pretty goof inmy opinion,far from their best but better than some of the other stuff they did.You might want to hear the album before you buy it.I give it a three and a half stars rating,the highpoints aren't enough to cover all the lows.They should have cut out a few songs and remained with the usual 8-10 songs.Worth checking out!r best but better than some of the other stuff they did.You might want to hear the album before you buy it.I give it a three and a half stars rating,the highpoints aren't enough to cover all the lows.They should have cut out a few songs and remained with the usual 8-10 songs.Worth checking out!
B00012FXB8|5.0|When an alien attacked a ship full of irritating blue-collar workers, the people loved it.    When the alien attacked a group of arrogant marines, the people loved it.    So why on earth, in the name of corn, for the sake of all that is good in this world (namely pizza) can't people like this? Shaven headed, Self rejected, isolated in a prison, fundamentalist converts being attacked by aliens? Is it so original that it hurts their heads? Were they so scared that they pushed the traumatic experiences from their minds? Do they not like it when christians are put in a good light? Or all of the above?    As far as I'm concerned, Alien3 is a gem that, not only should be heralded as the best Alien movie, but one of the best sci-fi, horror films of all time. Why? Yeah, I knew you would ask that, I'll tell you.    In this third installment of the Alien series Sigourney Weaver returns in her iconic role as Lt. Ripley. Though this time she is not backed up by miners or marines or even paid workers. This time she is backed up by a motley assortment of rapists, murderers and child molesters! But wait, there's more! they're religious converts! (very original I might add)     The difference between this film and it's predicessors is that this one uses a different approach in presenting itself. Where as the first film was simplistic yet disturbingly ominous, and the second one a big and explosive, even swashbuckling, to and extent, this third installment becomes dark and gritty. In high contrast to the original's sparing, almost blank style, Alien 3's setting is grimy and filthy. Much of the film takes place in dimly lit corridors, all of which have and ancient, disrepaired feel to them, giving the story a hopeless, forlorn feel. A rust colored tint seemed to have been added to much of the film, only adding to the films rusted style.     This is without a doubt one of the greatest, most disturbing pieces of art ever made.      9/10 stars.      Note: I watched the Assembly Cut, available in the two-disc special edition.
0786715103|5.0|Politics and politicians matter. Even corrupt self-serving politicians bring some structure and stability. We may scoff at politicians, but the fact is when they fail, when they are replaced by ideologues and hate mongers, and when the institutions in which they serve no longer work, the social body dies and people stand naked and unsheltered in the world. Civilization disappears and what we've built to establish justice collapses, plunging us into chaos and horror.<br /><br />Dallaire's book brings home that the genocide resulted from political failure. Failure first within Rwanda to hold the Hutu extremists in check. Failure of the UN to realize the magnitude of the problem. Failure of the major powers, especially France and the United States, to risk people and material to prevent a massacre. Failure of the Tutsi expatriate forces in Uganda to care for the Tutsi still in Rwanda. And, as Dallaire makes clear, the naïve failure of a soldier to understand that politics matter.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Dublin
078322737X|3.0|I was looking foward to seeing this in widescreen and it was great, the picture so clear.  The music was great too but the actors voices was very low volume.  By time you turned up the volume to hear that actors, the music was way too loud.  THAT could have been done better.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|The Best of Kansas offers most of their best songs, but you know, there's NEVER been a case where I was completely satisfied with a compilation disc.  It's because once you explore an artist more, you realize their Best of or Greatest Hit collection can't possibly capture their best moments.  And since \\"the best songs\\" and \\"their biggest hits\\" are two separate things, this CAN'T be the Best of Kansas.  It's missing a few highly memorable progressive rock tunes, especially some of their songs from the first two albums.  As someone who's a fan, I don't like that very much.  But then again, as a fan, I don't need this album.  I recommend you pick up the first two albums to hear what Kansas was like in the early days and then pick up one of their later albums to see where they ended up.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I grew up listening to the 1987 casette tape of The Phantom of the Opera, complete with the voices of Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and Sarah Brightman as Christine. My parents went to Ontario at the Pantages Theatre to watch the play. So, naturally, when the movie version came out in 2004, there was no doubt that it would be seen by my family.<br />The Phantom of the Opera, there, became real to me - not on stage, but in a movie theater. So much more I began to understand, and I found myself falling head over heals. (Who wouldn't? This is Gerard Butler, after all...)<br />This movie remains my favorite film of all time. The music, the romance, its sheer unforgettableness. The Phantom of the Opera will keep you singing long after the credits roll.
B000001ESP|4.0|Not their best album, but close to it.  I've never been a fan of \\"Red Barchetta\\" because the quiet vocals that build up in the beginning just pass by harmlessly, but not really excitedly.  Almost like the band wanted to open the song with mellow vocals without caring a whole lot about making them interesting to the listener.  I guess when the song gets going and the rocking section comes in, it improves.  \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is a classic as well.  What makes the other songs memorable is the fact that, this is an 80's album, and the band still had the spirit of the late 70's prog rock movement on their minds, because many of these songs could be from the 70's and I wouldn't know the difference.  Great album.

In fact, when I worked in a movie store, while in college, I watched [[ASIN:B00019075S Prey for Rock & Roll]] specifically because Gina Gershon was in the flick, due to her role in Bound.<br /><br />Bound is at times loud and violent, but the film also reveals subtle, sensual aspects of the characters that contrast with the angry gangster and the Tarantinoesque aspects of the movie.<br /><br />I do not think that I could ever tire of seeing this film again, or sharing it with others.  Whether you enjoy Gangster films, action films, or romantic films, this movie has something for nearly everyone.  If you love lesbian erotica, then definitely give this film a viewing.  don't rent it, purchase it; you'll want to see it (or at least segments of it) again and again.

B0002KPIQY|5.0|Angelina Jolie as model Gia.  This is a very good film, with a great story, and Angelina is fantastic.  I am unfamiliar with the original model and the  biography of Gia, but I loved this film.  Since [[ASIN:6305047456 Hackers]], I've watched anything with Angelina Jolie, and she seems right for the character portrayed.  I doubt that many actresses would have pulled off the \\"hooked\\" scenes as well as Jolie.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|The movie Love Actually is amazing as is the soundtrack!  I accidentally bought the German version of the soundtrack but it seemed to be the same except that Jump (For my Love) wasn't sung by the Pointer Sisters.  Still, great soundtrack and the instrumental pieces are wonderful!
1592402038|5.0|Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a delightful, light hearted look at the good, the bad and the simply incorrect of English grammar, told in straight forward, funny, personal style. Anyone who cares about written English must read this brief yet detailed discussion of the when, where and why of placing commas, simi-colons and the dreaded colon. Lynn Truss abley demonstrates her knowledge of the subject as well as the language used in discussing it. A small book packed with valuable information on punctuation, Eats, Shoots & Leaves should be on every writer's book shelf.
B000062XE1|5.0|I was surprised to find Jeremy Brett in a couple performances in this collection.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|5 Stars, great job. BUY IT!    At first I was a little wary. I usually don't like straight-to-DVD movies. However, I was really surprised after a few minutes into it. I love the show, and continue to watch reruns whenever I get a chance.     This is basically one long episode of SG1 that they didn't get a chance to air. Think of it as Stargate SG-1 Season 11: The Movie. The actors didn't drop a beat when making this film. Great continuity.     Ark of Truth is what Peacekeeper Wars did for Farscape, only we didn't have to wait 4 years. Because of this fact, none of the actors aged greatly passed their characters (*cough*Chiana*cough*).     As far as plot goes, they couldn't have done it better. Even though many people would agree that after Richard Dean Anderson left the show, it was no longer SG1, Ben Browder and Claudia Black performed better than anyone joining a show after 10 very successful seasons. I can't consider them replacements. Their characters influenced the plot drastically, which makes them unique to the flow of the series. To me, they should have been in the show since day one, but they were busy in another galaxy in an alien ship doing Farscape.     Special effects were wonderful, but not throughout the whole film. In the beginning, especially, the sets looked like sets rather than other planets. That's okay though, because it wasn't distracting.     All in all, it was a masterfully produced film and conclusion the the Ori arc. Well done. Go buy this dvd!

0452289963|1.0|I buy many books on audio CD and listen to them in my vehicle.  While I was very excited about A New Earth, I just could not listen to it.  His voice is very unexpiring and monotone.  I tried to listen to the first two CD's and just had to turn them off.  I have had the CD's for over a month now and if I need help to sleep I will put them on.  I would not recommend the CD's.

B00006AVRK|5.0|I absolutely love \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\". The stories of the happy-go-lucky, bumbling, slightly gormless, and chronically unlucky 'upper class twit', Bertie Wooster, and his witty, restrained, sagacious, and at all times effulgent gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, are quite simply the stuff of legends. The humour and wit of P.G. Wodehouse is so brilliantly and seemingly effortlessly translated into film, and the portrayal of these undying comic characters lead by the inimitable comedy duo of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, are spot on.     One of the best things about these stories, be that in book form or as a television series, is the in-offensiveness of them. This is comedy as innocent as it gets and yet it is sidesplittingly funny. The subtleties and of the language, the delivery, the situations, the build up. Dreaming up inoffensive humour with an appeal transcending social status, educational level, cultural and historical background, and other prejudices is an amazing feat any day. People might of course have looked upon these stories with different eyes when they were written decades ago, and found them to be very much offensive, but that merely adds to the genius of the tales. They are still very funny today in 2008. And they will be very funny in another 60 years time.     The only regrettable thing about these adaptions of the Jeeves and Wooster novels is, that some of the parts were played by different actors in different series. A character might be played by A in series 1, but by B in series 3. It is but a minor inconvenience, but an inconvinience it is. Also it would have been nice with some extra material with these DVDs in these 'extra features' days in which we live. Interviews, commentaries, documentaries, and the like would have been a great addition to this excellent production, but at the same time it must be said, that the non-inclusion of bonus features dosen't detract from the overall quality and feel of the DVD package. You just want more, is all.Highest possible recommendation.
B000005JA8|5.0|First of all let me say this CD sat in my collection for 7 years before I could listen to it. Ever since I picked it up and started listening to it I haven't been able to stop. In my opinion there are no stand outs and no filler on the whole CD Every song on the CD is just stellar

0143039504|3.0|(Let me preface this by saying that I am 24 years old and have great eyesight.)<br /><br />I love the idea of combining the novels into an easy-to-hold edition (and the cover is beautiful), but I am glad I borrowed this from the library before purchasing, because the typography is awful.<br /><br />To make the book easier to hold, they have sacrificed much in the way of readability.  The paragraphs are too wide, and font too small, and worst of all, the space between lines is far too small, making it virtually impossible to read without using a bookmark to follow along the lines.<br /><br />Jane Austen is not difficult to read, but the typography of the book makes it that way.  Do yourself a favor and buy each of these novel separately so that you can actually enjoy reading them, as opposed to struggling trying to follow which line you're on!

B000WMFZMY|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Good photography.  Excellent sets and exterior shots.  Great epic views of the armies, battles, and fights.<br />*There are a few good fights and a few good battle scenes.<br />*Some of the characters are interesting.<br />*Pretty good story with lots of thrilling or suspenseful scenes.<br />*Good costume and set design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very long.  Lots of drama and dialogue.<br />*This is not Charlton Heston's best performance.<br />*Some parts that make you ask \\"why?\\" Why didn't Rodrigo pull the arrow out of his chest? Why did everybody have such a grudge against him? Ugh.<br /><br />Despite being long, drawn-out, and bewildering at times, this is a pretty good epic.  It definately has a lot of big scenes with massive armies and intense duels.  Much of the story's conflicts focuses on all the different grudges everybody seems to have against the main character.  It's almost contrived; how could the King, his champion, all of the princes, and the princess be so dumb and hate this guy for such a long time? Still, it makes for some interesting drama that might keep the audience awake throughout.  If you like long epics, or if you like Charlton Heston, then this should be worthwhile watching.
B0007WPJBQ|4.0|This is the one and only Marlon Brando directed movie that was actually damned good.

Lots of interesting ideas concerning his approach to his business. Also good focus on his enemy (whoever Russel Crowe played, I forget his name). It was very interesting to see them cooperate at the end.<br />*Good, somewhat fascinating portrayal of the main characters.<br />*Plenty of drama.<br />*Some action and violence.<br />*Some memorable scenes and imagery.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little long.<br /><br />Compared to other gangster films, this one seems no better and no worse. It has lots of good imagery and interesting scenes. Ridley Scott's direction is excellent, as always. There is a lot of drama, and it looks like they went into a lot of trouble to make the film as realistic as possible to the characters, events, and settings. Still, it doesn't seem as thrilling or deep as the established classics. If you're into these kinds of films, then by all means watch it. Otherwise, rent it first and see what you think.<br /><br />The DVDs contain a massive shed-load of special features on the first two discs.  Disc one includes both the theatrical and extended cuts.  The third disc in this collector's set has only another hour's worth of features, and the digital copy of the film.
B0010358CQ|4.0|Unfortunately, most animae has turned to kiddy crap.    But not Appleseed! The first movie was groundbreaking when animae was somewhat new. Then the newer and better version came out.

Now Ex Machina comes out and does it a step further, filling out gaps in the last film and giving viewers an even more visual stunning, 3-D groundbreaking special effects that is balls-to-the-walls sci-fi/action/adventure that will surely satiate those dying for these types of films.    The problem is - they don't make enough of 'em!    The latest Highlander animated film was another great one.    Man, wating this on my 70-inch HD TV was truly remarkable.

Some parts are very low and other parts are too loud.<br />*A lot happens, and can be a little tedious to get through.<br /><br />This turned out better than I thought.  It is very engaging, with slick photography, fancy special effects, and cool fight scenes.  The middle of the movie has lots of drama and character development; a little long perhaps, but it makes for a good, deeper story.  Definately worthwhile for fans of sci-fi or fantasy.

Meanwhile, her mother's respectable family, the Maybricks, have forbidden her from being with her dying father during his final days. The gambling hall proprietor is an unsavory<br />character and more importantly, they do not want Evie or her inheritance out of their control. In fact, they want her to marry her cousin and keep the money within the family. Evie is not necessarily opposed to that plan, she's just not sure how long she'll survive after the wedding. Running away from the Maybricks, Evie quickly dismisses her friends' potential help. She does not want to burden them, and ultimately they could not protect her. Instead, she runs to the one person as desperate as herself.<br /><br />Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent is surprised to find an unchaperoned Evie at his home in the middle of the night. She knows that even spending a minute with the rake Sebastian will ruin her. Also, his thwarted kidnapping of her friend, heiress Lillian Bowman, could not have made him very popular. Sebastian has no idea what the mousy Evie could want. Undaunted by his rude welcome, Evie presents her proposal. She needs protection from the Maybricks, and Sebastian needs money. If they were married, their problems would be solved. Innocent Evie is nothing like the women the debauched, amoral, and proud Sebastian usually seeks out. He is, however, impressed by her courage and startled by her beauty. With creditors waiting in the wings, he agrees to a marriage of convenience, but insists that they consummate the union. He is not losing another heiress.<br /><br />Once the agreement is reached, the couple speeds off to Scotland for a quick marriage. Evie knows that Sebastian is not the sensitive man of her dreams, and he readily admits that he will make a terrible husband. However, his actions contradict his words as he offers Evie much unsolicited comfort during their long, cold journey. They both find their<br />wedding night to be alarming. Evie is overwhelmed by the intimate experience and realizes the strength of her feelings. At the same time, Sebastian, the profligate seducer, discovers a totally new carnal experience. Can he ever get enough?<br /><br />Upon returning to London, they find their marriage is not as convenient as they had planned. For the first time, Sebastian finds he is only attracted to one woman, his new wife. Nevertheless, Evie does not trust his affections. She feels she must reject his advancements or risk a broken heart. Could Sebastian really be the man of her dreams?

B0011HF6GE|5.0|I'm afraid to listen to this record too much as I don't ever want it's brilliance to dim.  Best thing I've heard in quite a while.  Let's see, Feist was the last artist that moved me like this, not that Bon Iver is anything like that and he'll probably never be over played in trendy boutique, but there's something so deep and soulful in the plaintive whisperings on this record.  Mostly it's quiet, mostly it's bone chillingly beautiful.  I actually bought it with Neil Young's Live at Massey Hall, and they somehow speak to each other with a sidelong glance to Vashti Bunyan's Lookaftering. Take a chance on this like I did, you won't be disappointed.  I hope to hear more from Bon Iver!

I got ripped off that way and besides that, the writing is all in another language on the boxes. I think they were bootleg copies from another country. This gives me the whole series that plays well and is a legal copy. It had free shipping and is the cheapest set on the net that I could find. I looked for it for over 6 months and then decided to get it from Amazon.

1416550518|5.0|I just finished \\"The House at Riverton\\" and am feeling simultaneously contented and bereft in the way that one feels after reading an excellent novel that's now, sadly, over.<br /><br />The basic story has been sketched out elsewhere -- Grace, age 14, becomes a maid at the manor house of Riverton in WWI-era England. There she meets siblings Hannah, Emmeline and David, whose lives are to affect hers drastically -- and vice versa. We also see a very elderly Grace in the modern day, as a filmmaker talks to her about a tragedy that happened many years ago at Riverton. (The full story of the event, which involves the suicide of a famed poet, isn't revealed until the end of the book, and it was quite a surprise to me.)<br /><br />\\"Riverton\\" was a fast read, but not a fluffy one. The plot moved along quickly (I had a -very- hard time putting it down), and the writing was fabulous. Not in that \\"wow, this author is really giving her thesaurus a workout\\" kind of way, but in a very natural way.<br /><br />Kate Morton does an excellent job of bringing early 20th-century England to life, particularly in the way she portrays the relationships between Grace, the other servants, and the siblings. I was afraid at first that she might portray Grace as becoming a \\"buddy\\" to Hannah and Emmeline, which would have been highly unlikely in that time and place. But Morton avoids that temptating anachronism, and there's even a funny part where the actress who plays Grace in the movie talks with the elderly Grace and seems absolutely clueless about the ironclad rules of English society at the time.<br /><br />If I do have any complaints, it's that a couple of the characters were rather thinly drawn -- Teddy and Emmeline in particular. However, Grace and Hannah, as the main characters, seemed wholly real to me. And while I loved \\"The House at Riverton\\" and couldn't wait to finish it, I'm now sorry to see them go.

Only an economist  would find this to be anything of a revelation. Herb Simon won the Nobel in Economics three decades ago for pointing out that people do not behave according to the rules of mathematically normative rationality that are assumed in most economic models; an idea which psychologists have understood well for decades before that. And economists are STILL just waking up to this idea, and writing books about it, books psychologists could have written (and did, it turns out) decades earlier. Yikes.

B000UJ48XG|5.0|This is their second LP release, and by far their best release to date.    Critics are quick to say Beirut's sound is Euro-stylized by influences like Jacques Brel and François Hardy. They're eager to compare the band's frontman, Zach Condron, to Scott Walker. It won't be long before they liken Beirut to the Tindersticks had Stuart Staples turned queer.    But \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" proved Zach Condon has developed a musical style beyond compare.     Whereas \\"Gulag Orkestar\\" showed that the self-ordained small time American band could meld Macedonian folk sounds with romantic classical European music stylings and bourgeoise bohemian sophistication, \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" uses this melded sound as the departure point toward a far more striking occurrence: style defined without subculture.    Timeless, ageless, genderless, cultureless, songs like \\"Cliquot\\" and \\"The Penalty\\" make \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" an album that could have come out of almost any place in the world at any point in history.    But it's not just universal in those senses. Perhaps because of frontman Zach Condon's sophisticated, mature air and voice, it was refreshing and unexpected to hear him sing such honest lyrics about love. It was, well, sweet. Better yet, it is why I think \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" is nothing short of genius.     In sum, \\"The Flying Club Cup\\": Beirut's balkan-gypsy-folk-french-euro-pop music style renowned in their first LP release, made even better with more mature lyrics for the young at heart.

0553381687|2.0|After seeing this book highly recommended on countless fantasy sites, I gave in and bought it. I had to quit reading it on about page 300. It was just like sitting at home and watching soap operas on the tv...if you like that sort of thing then oh well. It is considered high/epic fantasy, so now I know to avoid books in that category. People actually rate this book along with LOTR...bah! Tolkien is my all time favorite(I've read all 4 of his books in his series 12 times since 1989) And LOTR is not just high/epic fantasy. It has a good amount of sword and sorcery/heroic fantasy blended in also. Actually Tolkie's books were 'mostly' heroic fantasy. High fantasy is boring just by itself. If you like reading historical fiction, like the kind you had to read in school, then you will like The Game of Thrones. If you like authors such as R.E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock and David Gemmell, you will not like this book. George R.R. Martin is a good writer, it's just that his fantasy is not the fantasy I've grown up reading. Be forewarned!
0553208845|5.0|What more can I say about this book that the other 452 reviews before me have missed? Nothing I suppose, and this review is mostly for my own benefit. I finished this book over the span of two or three days, and while being a simply written book, it has been in my thoughts for some weeks. This book follows a young man through his life until he is old, living beside a river and learning everything from that river.<br /><br />What I took from the book was this: that there is no \\"answer\\" to life. Each one of us has different abilities, thoughts, backgrounds, ideologies... What really matters is time ticking by. This second, that second. Siddhartha realizes at the end of the book that wisdom and experience are different things. That trying to explain wisdom, as the Buddha and many, many other wise men try to do, is impossible-- only knowledge can be transferred, but not wisdom. In that sense, Siddhartha realized that our best teacher is ourselves.<br /><br />I was confused in some senses on the personal philosophy of Siddhartha; how can one truly learn from a river? It seems as though one could arrive at any conclusion based on a river, or any thing in nature or of observation, for that matter. Perhaps, Siddhartha realized that awareness, and living each moment was the answer to peace and happiness.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book, but unfortunately had expectations going into it based on the many reviews on Amazon. As always, expectations usually carry the nature of tainting many great things. Ah well, I will remember this book until the day I die.
0307341542|1.0|While this is mildly entertaining, the cliches and predictable story lines are slightly unbearable at times. I felt that this was a huge waste of my time. I'm honestly shocked to see all of these glowing reviews.     Let's put it this way: at age 13 I would have been absolutely tickled with this book. But if you've graduated junior high it's terribly redundant, like reading your kid sister's diary mixed with a bad romance novel complete with the painfully over-used \\"mysterious\\" Southern family, token Lolita character and Mommy issues.
B0000024K1|5.0|It takes a nation of millions to hold back my review...I wish there were more than 5 stars.  If you do not view this album as AT LEAST Top 5 all time then you are probably new to the game or not credible to write a hip hop review.  Ground-breaking, genre smashing, educational and angry, but all the while staying innovative and funky.  For those of you who were even alive in 1988, this album was not typical of the times.  Even their first release \\"Bum Rush the Show\\" was before its time and still can't hold a candle to this.  This album broke the mold.  The Bombsquad with Hank and Keith Shocklee were perfecting the art of layering sounds and experimenting with strange, unique samples which give the album its serrated edge.  Saying Chuck's lyrics are mind-blowing is the understatement of a lifetime.  You can say what you want about Flav but the contrast between the two of them is the beauty of it all.  I was a kid growing up in turbulent racial times in my neighborhood back then and Chuck was my professor kicking knowledge.  I learned so much more about Black History from Chuck D than I ever did in school or anywhere else for that matter.  I bought this album the day it came out in '88 and I still rock it weekly, now 20 years later.  Play \\"Louder than a Bomb\\", \\"Rebel Without a Pause\\" or \\"Prophets of Rage\\" and tell me you don't get chills up your spine...I still do.  There will NEVER be another release quite like this, mainly because the samples alone would probably cost too much these days.  Aside from that, hip hop doesn't' get any better than this.  Raw, aggressive, gritty, angry beats under vicious, intelligent, heart-felt lyrics that grab you by the throat.  Chuck is the King and PE the greatest of all time with this being their pinnacle.  Damn, I wish I had a time machine.  To whomever gave this album a lackluster review: Just stop listening to music all together because you really don't get it.  Go watch MTV or listen to some of the garbage that the radio calls hip hop these days and dissolve in to the puddle of puke that is today's mainstream hip hop and mainstream music for that matter.  This album was before suburban O.G.s, white kids with corn rows and the baseless debate about who's the best: Biggie or Pac.  PLEASE!  Chuck D is not only the most informative, knowledge-driven MC of all time but the best overall without a doubt.  Rakim is the only other one close.  Rap was never the same before or after this album.  In retrospect it was a swan song of sorts for the old school.  The '90's, or Terrordome as Chuck called it, were right around the corner and the whole game changed.  This was the first and last of its breed.  \\"Where you never been I'm in!\\"
0525950079|5.0|LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! I just finished reading this book this morning. It took me only a week to finish it because I could not put it down.     First and foremost if you are a fan of historical novels than this is book will completely intrigue you. However, more so than that it is a book that covers the lives of these amazing characters with so many twists and turns that you never know what comes next so it always keeps you wanting to know more.     I just happened to pick this book up at the book store not having ever read a Ken Follet book before. Having enjoyed this so much I am on my way today to pick up the Prequel \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"    I highly recommend this amazing drama filled, awe inspiring, lusty, creative piece of literature!!!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I have always loved this movie, even the original release with the corny voice overs. The original director's cut I would consider to be my favorite movie of all times. What Ridley Scott did with this release is fantastic. Unlike some directors who say something like, \\"if you want it on DVD or Blu-ray you will watch the version I want you to watch\\" or who release the different versions one at a time costing a fortune, Ridley Scott put all the releases in one fantastic package. He even said that he knows some people have a passion for one release over others and he wanted to honor that and release all of them in the best possible format. Now there is a director that cares about his fans!<br /><br />If you have never seen Blade Runner, you are in for a treat. If you are a fan of Blade Runner, you must buy this set! Don't just buy the new version, spend the extra money and get the whole thing. If you have Blu-ray or are thinking about getting Blu-ray, buy the Blu-ray version. It is amazing how well this movie has endured the test of time. The special effects are still impressive. I watched the new version with a teenager who has grown up with all the new and impressive special effects and even he was impressed at how good these effects looked.<br /><br />I have said for many years that Blade Runner is the standard by which all Science Fiction movies must be measured. Now I say this collector's edition is the standard by which all future collector's editions should be measured.
0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" stands among the most profoundly written books of our generation.  Filled with rich and meaningful content, it draws upon the wisdom of many ancient traditions while injecting them with modern relevance and insight.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle is one of the few authors who doesn't gloss over our need to face the darkest corners of our consciousness in order to become more enlightened beings. By removing the labels of \\"bad\\" and \\"good\\" we are encouraged to experience our lives just as they are, by surrendering to the moment of now.<br /><br />Even the old soul who has already read dozens of books about spirituality and personal growth should be able to find perspectives within its pages that deepen self-understanding.<br /><br />With clarity and firmness, the author demonstrates how our egos become the masters of our lives, creating suffering and misery in the world.  His discussion of what he calls the \\"pain body\\" is insightfully presented with tact and compassion.  This book may be a challenge for the spiritual beginner, but for anyone ready to awaken from spiritual slumber, it provides challenge,inspiration and deepened insight.<br /><br />Be ready to spend some time with this book. It is rich with food for thought that may take time to digest.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I purchased the first album about eight months ago and enjoyed it very much.  I purchased this album about two weeks ago.  I am going to buy one for my car.  All The Lost Souls really speaks to me on so many levels.  I find myself putting on the headphones and listening to it late a night when I can't sleep.  Each cut on this album appeals to me for a different reason.  My favorite is Carry You Home.  A friend of mine lost a granddaughter in Irak, a nurse, and Carry You home seems just perfect.  Of all the albums I have purchased over the years, and since I am 73 there have been a lot of albums, this is by far my favorite.  The songs are funny, sad, happy, silly, you get the idea.  James Blunt does not have the best voice in the world, but he certainly gets the message across.  The songs are wonderful in both lyrics and music and he delivers the messages beautifully.  I wonder when the third album will be available.
3895089281|5.0|i love this book for all the photographs inside. it's extremely helpful in understanding the art of shoemaking as opposed to shoe manufacturing. the vass brand name and family name churn out exceptionally high quality shoes and boots, and it's great to see a book detailing just that.
B00005B36H|5.0|From the opening bars of \\"The Grudge\\", this album sweeps you up into a maelstrom of thought and emotion beyond the level one might typically expect from a metal band. This is Tool's magnum opus...their \\"Master of Puppets\\"...their transcendent moment...and the new listener is in for quite an experience. This is Aenima refined, extended, and crystallized into a paragon against which other albums in this genre might be measured for years to come.     There are complaints surrounding what some dismissively term \\"filler tracks\\". My perspective is that such tracks serve as rest stops along a powerful and intense road. After the closing crescendo of \\"The Patient\\", for example, one needs a moment to find their center again and prepare for the next round. Sure...after a while, some of these tracks can become tedious. But my point is simply that it doesn't feel slapped together. The set communicates method and intention.     Juggling themes of mythology, numerology, psychology, metaphysics, etc... Tool manages to carve a spiritual significance out of their rhythmic, multi-layered, and sometimes jarring auditory blitz. Once you've been enveloped by the surging patterns of sound, the words rise up - here soft and measured, there brutal and overwhelming - to draw you into a moment of passion that reaches out across the mixing board and into a corner of your soul.     These words might come across as a bit of hyperbole on my part...but suffice it to say that whatever Lateralus might be, it will never be tagged \\"easy listening\\". It is fervent and rough, mystical and uplifting in its uniquely paradoxical manner...and I wouldn't have it any other way.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|I saw this movie as a child and have never forgotten it.  I shared lines from it with my friends in High School such as \\"We want you to lead us!\\" and \\"We have a name for a man such as you, we call such a man, El Cid!\\"  I recall thinking Sophia Loren was the most beautiful woman on the planet after seeing her in this film.  The battle scene on the beach at the walls of Valencia is one of the most spectacular I have ever seen.  All this, without CGI!  I recently purchased and watched this remastered DVD and was again blown away.  I had my 10 year old son sit and watch it with me and he was captivated!  I think that this is one of the biggest epics of all time.  Charlton Heston is at his Ben Hur and Ten Commandments prime and a true hero.  You will not be dissapointed if you purchase this.  Be sure to share it with your friends.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|It was probably hard enough for Arctic Monkeys to live up to the kind of hype that preceded the release of their first album let alone follow it with another album of equal quality. Yet that is precisely what they have done. I first heard about them through a couple of English music magazines I read regularly and bought the first album shortly after its release. That was so good there was no question as to whether I would give them another shot so I pre-ordered this a year ago and was delighted to hear that Arctic Monkeys are not just a one stroke wonder.  Favourite Worst Nightmare confirms that Arctic Monkeys are one of the freshest sounding rock bands around today. The band has good basic rock instincts that it blends with judicious touches of punk and alt-rock. This CD is loaded with winners. My favorites are Brianstorm (no, not Brainstorm), Teddy Picker, Flourescent Adolescent, Do Me A Favor, This House Is A Circus, If You Were There Beware, Old Yellow Bricks, and 505. Most songs are relatively short and to the point in the classic punk manner. My only complaint is that the album is short as well, clocking in at just under forty minutes.  If you are already an Arctic Monkeys fan, you know how good they can be. If you are unfamiliar with them and just curious, then I highly recommend Favourite Worst Nightmare if you enjoy the style of music described above.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This movie is timeless. Steve Mc Queen at his best with a great supporting cast and wonderful sound track.
B00102F5WK|5.0|I'm not sure if it was intentional, but on my copy, bought in Hong Kong, there were Chinese subtitles for the subplot, which was spoken in Arabic (or, perhaps, another Middle Eastern language), but no English subtitles.    It is then perhaps an accidental tribute to the filmmakers that the film still works. It makes the film more global and decenters the American viewer: yes, after September 11, Americans have to give up control of knowledge: yes, there are other people, and no, the narcissism must have a stop.    As to a \\"liberal agenda\\". It happened to be on the agenda at Runnymede, it was in fact on the Barons' liberal agenda when they forced King John to sign Magna Carta, and the ability to override habeus corpus is not a fit subject for debate in a society claiming to be democratic.    Conservatives like duh-bate, and putting everything up for grabs. But guess what: IF you can be imprisoned arbitrarily and for an arbitrary length of time, then you cannot participate in a duh-bate. As Habermas has shown, the very possibility of debate (whether informed or one of those conservative, phoney duh-bates) is preconditioned on rights.    The \\"agenda\\" of rendition is to get us to identify, just enough, with a man who's taken away and locked up without rights.    Well, I'll be dipped. The film has an agenda. So did Indiana Jones (western hegemony, with a stupid grin).    Incommunicado. It's a weird feeling. I was tossed by mistake into the adult lockup at Chicago police HQ at the age of 15 for participating in a civil rights demonstration.    So when am I getting out of here? Do I get a baloney sandwich? Where's Mom?    I was guilty as charged and they let me go. Now, suppose you're not guilty.    Feels bad, doesn't it, and in a way that has a social dimension. It makes you reconsider your relations with your fellows in a deep way and say, this should never happen.     \\"Zero tolerance\\" in domestic American law is basically the idea that in order to prevent drug and sex crimes, it is better to be safe than sorry, and lock up people for sentences, sometimes for victimless crimes, and sometimes when they are innocent. The punishment of a purely innocent person is considered to be a cost factor.    It's an interesting cost, since we don't pay it, the victim pays the cost and is never recompensed, whether he's someone locked up mistakenly in a domestic prison, or someone who is \\"rendered\\".    In a dark-star turn, Meryl Streep argues for extraordinary rendition. She claims that it prevented a London incident.    This makes no sense. If you detain the wrong guy, you haven't prevented anything and are wasting scarce cop resources (including baloney sandwiches).    If you have whom you think is the right guy, what's wrong with waking up a judge? The argument here is the need for secrecy; you don't want the bad guys to know you've nailed one of them.    This manages to significantly exagerrate the value of police and military intelligence. In his book on military intelligence, John Keegan, the British military writer, shows that it is almost never critical to war-winning, and in the case of the \\"war on terror\\", your adversaries will rarely profit from knowing which of their real operatives you've taken down.    The \\"war on terror\\" will be won when the United States stops sponsoring almost every decision made by the Israelis, and stops using military force to try to obtain oil reserves. It would be better fought in the open by a USA that simply refuses to stop being a country ruled by laws.    Do we become a Fascist society if one person is denied habeus corpus? Isn't this a Godwin convergence, similar to the way that internet conversations converge towards comparisions to Hitler? Is it some sort of bad behavior to get rowdy, and start calling people and societies Fascist when someone we don't even know is violated?    I think we do. Recently, Tim Berners-Lee has warned people that they are leaving too much information about themselves on theInternet. It didn't occur to him to question why we should worry. One of the reasons given was that marketers would know too much about us.    But what was interesting is that Berners-Lee assumes as given a need for anonymity.     What are we all scared of? Being a victim, whether of job loss or extraordinary rendition?    Why do we have to go on like this?
B000003TAL|5.0|This is it, as far as I'm concerned; the ultimate justification for the existence of Sonic Youth as a band.    I was mildly precocious as an Irish teenager because I was buying import copies of 'Sister' and 'Confusion Is Sex' when my peers were digging the rad new sounds of U2's 'The Joshua Tree'.  I remember going to see REM in Dublin in 1989, when they were just about to become absolutely huge, and the pre-show music was this album, which I already owned.  I wore a Sonic Youth t-shirt to that gig.  It didn't survive the amount of sweat I generated that night.    Yes, part of me was being a pretentious git.  Truth be told, I was at least as baffled by Sonic Youth as I was entranced.  I honestly loved songs like 'Making the Nature Scene' and 'Schizophrenia' and 'Pipeline/Kill Time', but then there would be half an album's worth of stuff that I couldn't figure out at all.  Then, bless them, they made 'Daydream Nation'.    A few years after this album came out, I would go to parties as an unenthusiastic cub journalist and overhear conversations in which older journalists would have perfectly serious discussions (really!) about how Nirvana's 'Nevermind' was 'the defining album of our generation'.  The hell with all that, I thought; I knew that there were two recordings that spoke to and for me as somebody who came of age around the time the Berlin wall came down.  One of them was Dinosaur Jr's 'Freak Scene'.  The other one was 'Daydream Nation'.    For me, this is like the White Album and Sgt Pepper combined - not so much a rock album as a huge, sprawling environment, a city unto itself, which I can only take in a bit at a time.  There's the gorgeous, high-energy nostalgia of 'Teenage Riot'; the mysterious 'Providence'; the scary 'Hey Joni'; the fabulous trash of 'Silver Rocket' and 'Eliminator Jr'; the enigmatic call to arms of 'Cross The Breeze'...I could go on.  And on.  And on.  Most importantly to me, there's Lee Ranaldo's stunning finest four minutes ever, 'Eric's Trip', one of the most dizzying marriages of songwriting craftsmanship, toneless half-singing and guitar mayhem ever recorded.      'Daydream Nation' was so good that it actually killed Sonic Youth for me.  I never bought another album by them again until years later, when I got 'Experimental Jet Set' on the strength of its dreamy and menacing non-hit, 'Bull in the Heather'.  Hardly the behaviour of a true fan, I admit it.      They finally played Dublin, at midnight in the scuzzy Olympia Theatre, some years ago.  I was there.  They rocked, but I was in my late twenties by then and I was just boggling at all the teenagers for whom this was clearly one of their bands.  I stood there drinking beer out of a plastic cup and marvelling that Ireland had become a place where Sonic Youth might actually play a gig.  Too late for me, though.     This is still one of the great American rock albums.  It's certainly in my top ten.
B00111L0MY|5.0|Even though the film raised more questions than it answered it was definitely worth watching and worth praise.
B000063UR2|4.0|I can't wait for the day that they redo this movie! Perhaps after Sweeney Todd is old news, someone should get ahold of Tim Burton! I love this movie, this is just a great story and one of those movies that despite the fact that it is basically as old skool as you can get, it's just a really good story.
0743454537|4.0|This is the story of a family's struggle with life and death and relationships.  It is a series of events viewed separately through the eyes of each character.  Fascinating story of interwoven feelings with each person's motives altruistic, but only after examination.

B000O77QDI|5.0|Of the 6 men shown raising the flag in Joe Rosenthal's famous photogtraph, PFC Ira Hayes is the Marine at the very rear. At the end of the Iwo Jima campaign, he, Navy corpsman John \\"Doc\\" Bradley and PFC Rene Gagnon were the only survivors of the men who raised Old Glory on Suribachi. We know the story; that picture was so compelling that the government whisked away the survivors and sent them cross-country on a bond-tour, being hailed as heroes from one coast to the other. The goal of the drive was to raise $14 billion or else the USA would run out of money. This particular drive raised over $20 billion and it was largely due to the dog-and-pony show these three men were constantly subjected to. These men were exploited as heroes, a label that none were comfortable with. How could they be heroes with all the dead and maimed that resulted from the carnage of Iwo Jima ?    With much the same effectiveness as he showed with the companion film \\"Letters From Iwo Jima,\\" Director Clint Eastwood shows the very human struggles or otherwise ordinary people who answered their nation's call without any quest for glory or reward. They wanted to do their duty and for the three flag-raisers, the bond tour became that duty. In the end, that is what makes these individuals heroes. . .
B000MV9026|1.0|So very boring, full of innuendo, absurd story, &  soooo very long! And the sexuality! I mean, really, the penguins are getting it on! How can a director who can make such a fantastic variety of movies (Mad Max & Babe) make this turkey? The trailers & commercials for this movie were totally misleading. It doesn't just stick to the social misfit plot. I was shocked it got an oscar nod and worse, won over two vastly superior movies, Cars and Monster House. MH should have won!!!! I would have given this one a razzie, if they had an animated category. See Surf's Up instead of this if you're a penguin lover.
B000O77RL4|5.0|Eastwood's portrayal of the Japanese garrison of Iwo Jima from 1944 till the island finally fell does well to show the human side of the defenders. The Japanese fighting man has been shown, not without justification, as the single-minded fanatic that will die for his Emperor and take as many of the enemy with him. Eastwood endeavors to demonstrate that there were Japanese who hated the privations inflicted by being on that island just as much as the Americans who conquered it. Japanese who would rather be at home or on their horses. But it was their tragic sense of duty that ensured that of the original strength of 25,000 that only a few hundred survived. The testamenmt to their bravery and endurance is found throughout this feature in their correspondence. Hence the title.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Someone's gonna have to put together a Boston trilogy or the like in the near future packaging \\"The Departed\\" \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and perhaps \\"Good Will Hunting\\" or the forthcoming \\"Shelter Island\\"...I REALLY wanted to give this review 5 stars but just couldn't do it as enough time hasn't passed to see if it holds up or if I begin to feel differently about it after multiple viewings...For right now, I do think it has been overlooked in comparison to a number of films released in recent years...There is little fat on the script and the dialogue is kept short...Casey Affleck performs well though given he is essentially playing himself I don't think we should be so quick to crown him a great actor...The insight into Boston's race relations and underbelly is great...details like mentioning the Cape Verdean population and filming in the Quincy quarries gives the film a real sense of authenticity...The film doesn't dance around tough issues--child abuse, drug abuse, nature vs. nurture, etc. and doesn't provide answers for the viewer...merely presents a difficult situation, shows how one individual resolves it and leaves it to you to decide if it was the best way or not...Well done and worth viewing and discussing...
0937381888|5.0|Great book!  Logically presented.  Concise.  Current.      You can skim the quick how-tos and get to brewin' in the first chapter and then you can delve into the finer points of how and why in the later chapters.
0307263118|3.0|I read the book at a particularly dark time in life, and thus found the author's own sense of self-loathing darkness almost of comfort. I also, suffering from a chronic disease (but no death in sight) am familiar with his expertly described sensation of being alien to the person you love and care for the most: years of togetherness until \\"news\\" of death do us apart... But the flashbacks to his earlier love and the sense of both reverence and revilement of his dying cancerous wife left me wanting at times. I was sympathetic then at some point began to feel she needs more development in the book: how she feels, the actions she's taking against this inevitably entirely self-absorbed man. While he says as some point it was her who died, he clearly plunges into the experience as if it's his own leaving her very little breathing room and then finally, none.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|There's a time out of mind feeling in \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" that makes me think it could just as easily have taken place in the 60's. If Francis (Owen Wilson) hadn't kept looking for a power cord, I would have been flashing back to the time when the Kinks' music from the soundtrack was original.     The story's about three brothers: Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Francis originally tells his two younger sibs they're going on a spiritual journey after their father's death. His real motive is to find their mother (Anjelica Huston), who's gone off to an Indian convent instead of attending their father's funeral.     Unfortunately, the brothers are not only not bonding--they're driving the conductor crazy til they get kicked off.  They do manage to pull things together to help some locals and in so doing, experience the revival they'd needed.  From there, they travel to see their Mom.     Even if the brothers are occasionally depressing, the scenery, music, and train are well worth watching \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" for.  This is definitely a spiritual journey even for those of us watching in the audience.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Instant cult classic gem!  (\\"This car is 100% death proof!\\")  This is not a movie to go into with expectations of a normal movie - it's just a fun experience.  Think of it as something like a roller coaster - it's not something to think about, just let it roll over you.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Chris McCandless' life story demanded someone with a voice that's evocative, but spare. The instrumentation needed to be varied, but simple. I had no idea Eddie could play all the instruments he's used to create the musical landscape for this soundtrack. This is pretty impressive musicianship.      \\"Hard Sun\\" is the song that's gotten most of the play from this CD. It's one of my favorites as well as \\"Society\\", \\"Far Behind\\", and \\"Setting Forth.\\"     In my opinion, this is a CD that's not just for the Pearl Jam fans, but people who love good, solid acoustic music are going to enjoy \\"Into the Wild\\" as well and nobody could have done it better than Eddie Vedder.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|SPOILERS below!!<br /><br />This is not your typical creature feature/horror/action fest of a movie.  Will Smith deserves a lot of credit for imbuing the character of Robert Neville with determination, sadness, desperation, and basic humanity in the face of unimaginable danger and desolation.<br />He believes he is the only man left on Earth, so we can't even imagine the depths of his loneliness.  Having watched his wife and daughter die, the only things keeping him going are the quest for a possible cure for the killer virus (which has destroyed most humans and turned the remainder into murderous freaks; and the love of his loyal family dog, Sam.<br />  Two scenes in particular are extremely moving and sad:  the infection of Sam, whom Robert has to put down before she turns on him; and a scene in which he begs a mannequin to say hello to him because he has heard no other human voice besides his own in three years.<br />  It was a bit simplistic to include scenes in which a woman and her son find Robert and he at first declares that there is no survivors' camp and no God--and then later he decides they were meant to find him because they can carry the cure (in the form of a vial of blood) with them to Vermont, where survivors do, in fact, live.<br />  Don't let that keep you away, though.  This is a well-done story of a man, his dog, and the fight to keep the human race going.
B000UJBYD8|3.0|The cd has grown on me a little since the disappointing first listen so I'll give it 3 stars. I'm a huge Cult fan so I would have bought this cd even if I knew how poor it was. To all the people that gave it 5 stars, C'mon people get real, I know you love the band but lets be honest. This is no way a 5 star effort. Even 4 stars is a strecth. To be honest I was shocked at how bad this cd was on the first play thru. Nothing really stood out except for Born into this with the Stones guitar riff and the very funky War Pony Destroyer. Born into this has grown on me a lot and has it's own personality aside from the Stones riff. I dont really think about the copied riff anymore. War Pony Destroyer is my favorite song. So funky and cool. Needs a good solo which this cd has none of. I cringe every time I hear Holy Mountain. I dont know what the band or the producers were thinking. I guess nobody wanted to offend Ian by cutting the track but the song is laughable. Like others have written he sounds like a worn out fat Elvis or some really bad lounge singer. Sorry if you read this Ian, I do still love you very much. Overall a poor effort. Hey I understand if they're written out. Still I'm surprised after all the time between cds that they couldnt come up with better material. These guys arent really that old. Ian 46 and Billy 47 still have some life left. Hopefully they have another good one in them. If not so be it. They had a good run even though they never really \\"made\\" it. This cd is only for big fans of the band. Not for the casual fan.
B000NA2776|5.0|Escuchar a Mika es llevarse un chapuz&oacute;n de serotonina. Es como el chocolate y el buen sexo: te pone HI.

Es que la alegr&iacute;a de sus griticos y su m&uacute;sica juguetona es imposible que no te ponga con ganas de saltar y alzar los brazos, al menos esos son los efectos que tienen en mi \\"Gracy Kelly\\" y \\"Lollipop\\". Si es necesario que se encierren en el carro o en un cuarto a solas para admitirlo &iexcl;h&aacute;ganlo! Es liberador.<br /><br />Mikahil Holbrook tiene 24 a&ntilde;os, naci&oacute; en Beirut y se cri&oacute; en Inglaterra. Desde el 2006 hab&iacute;a lanzado \\"Take it easy\\", pero es desde febrero del 2007 que es oficialmente un cantante para el mundo. A&ntilde;o en que su &aacute;lbum debut Life in cartoon motion (bajo el sello de Universal, Island Records UK) cosech&oacute; cuatro premios, el sencillo \\"Grace Kelly\\" se llev&oacute; ocho premios, \\"Relax Take it easy\\" tres, \\"Love today\\" cuatro y otro par de canciones se llevaron uno. Finalmente en enero 2008 el ni&ntilde;o bello liban&eacute;s fue premiado como el Mejor artista revelaci&oacute;n en directo (British Breakthrough Act) en los Brit Awards 2007. Ahora Mika ya trabaja en su segundo &aacute;lbum.<br /><br />En una entrevista cont&oacute; que buscando entrar a la industria fue rechazado por ser \\"demasiado mel&oacute;dico para la escena Indie y demasiado raro para la escena comercial.\\" &iexcl;Que bueno que estas cosas ya no se est&aacute;n decidiendo s&oacute;lo en esas escenas, sino por el p&uacute;blico que escucha!<br /><br />\\"Mika declara que ha crecido escuchando de todo, de Joan Baez o Dylan hasta Serge Gaingsbourg o flamenco y que admira a los grandes compositores como Harry Nilson, Prince o Elton John, capaces de hacer grandes discos con una visi&oacute;n propia.\\"<br /><br />A Mika lo comparan, y la mayor&iacute;a de las veces con malas intenciones, con Elton John, Freddie Mercury, Scissors Sisters, Beck, T-Rex y Rufus Wainwright. A parte de eso a mi me suena que hay bastante ABBA influenciando su sonido, sobre todo en \\"Take it easy\\"; tambi&eacute;n tiene sus dosis del George Michael de Wahm! y de The Beatles en \\"Billy Brown\\".<br /><br />En lo particular escuchar sonidos bien influenciados no me irrita. Y es que es inevitable, sobre todo si lo comparas con semejantes m&aacute;quinas del Pop. Con toda la influencia y los parecidos que se le quiera achacar a Mika, a mi me parece que sigue siendo autentico. Ponle atenci&oacute;n a sus letras y ver&aacute;s.<br /><br />Las cr&iacute;ticas m&aacute;s fuertes se centran en que se parece demasiado -imita o copia- a Scissors Sisters y en que en ese sentido estos son mucho mejores. Sus detractores s&oacute;lo el aceptan el single \\"Grace Nelly\\" y el resto del disco lo echan a la candela.<br /><br />A mi me encanta que lo comparen (con sa&ntilde;a destructiva) con Freddie Mercury, de quien siempre estar&eacute; profundamente enamorada y quien adem&aacute;s es un astro que brillar&aacute; por siempre sobre nuestras cabezas. Y es que Mika canta en \\"Grace...\\" \\"Intento ser como Grace Kelly./ Pero todos sus aspectos eran demasiado tristes./ As&iacute; que intento ser como Freddie./ Mi identidad se ha vuelto loca.\\"<br /><br />En sus letras Mika se habla a s&iacute; mismo, se dice cosas sin sentido, otras con demasiado y mayormente se dice verdades un poco fuertes, como en \\"Lollipop\\" que dice \\"&iexcl;Canta!/ Chupando demasiado tu piruleta, / el amor har&aacute; que te vengas abajo.\\" y el resto de la letra se pone m&aacute;s \\"dura\\", pero la m&uacute;sica es tan happy.<br /><br />En \\"My Interpretation\\" Mika canta con m&aacute;s balada y charrasqueos de guitarra que fiesta, en un tono de resignada aceptaci&oacute;n: \\"Si la mitad de lo que dijiste fuera cierto,/ y la mitad de lo que no he llegado a hacer pudiese ser diferente,/acaso eso lo har&iacute;a mejor?/ si olvid&aacute;ramos lascosas que sabemos./Acaso tendr&iacute;amos un lugar a d&oacute;nde ir?/ El &uacute;nico camino es hacia abajo, y puedo darme cuenta de ello/Ahora.\\" Esta tercera canci&oacute;n es como down en el disco, un intermedio. &iquest;Ser&aacute; por sus influencias de la &Oacute;pera?<br /><br />Ah, pero en \\"Love today\\" vuelve la vibra sexy y alegre, con m&aacute;s sintetizador, teclado y bater&iacute;a, porque es la consecuencia natural a la canci&oacute;n anterior, con suficiente irreverencia y trasgresi&oacute;n en la letra: \\"Oye chica por qu&eacute; no puedes seguir adelante?,/Es porque simplemente tu madre te tiene nublada/ Es un poco fuerte, es como s&oacute;lo probar para divertirte/ Bueno tu ya no tendr&aacute;s que pobrar a ning&uacute;n otro,/ Te har&eacute; una amante.\\"<br /><br />Mika crea una m&uacute;sica aut&eacute;ntica, que no anda buscando aprobaci&oacute;n, y para mi: lo hace muy bien. Las letras expresan situaciones, emociones y posturas muy sentidas, y en ocasiones sicod&eacute;licas y oscuras, mientras la m&uacute;sica ofrece en contraposici&oacute;n ritmos alegres y ligeros. A mi me sirve.<br /><br />En \\"Take it easy\\" canta \\"Relax/ Hay una respuesta a los tiempos m&aacute;s obscuros./ Est&aacute; claro que no entendemos, pero la &uacute;ltima cosa en mi mente/ Es salir de ti./ Creo que estamos en esto juntos./ No grites - hay tantos caminos a la izquierda.<br /><br />Luego viene una canci&oacute;n melanc&oacute;lica, con coros y violines, llamada \\"Any other world\\" que comienza con una anciana contando cosas tristes y dice la canci&oacute;n \\"...Di adi&oacute;s a aquel mundo en el que cre&iacute;as que viv&iacute;as/ incl&iacute;nate, act&uacute;a el papel de un solitario, solitario coraz&oacute;n/ di adi&oacute;s a aquel mundo en el que pensabas que viv&iacute;as/ al mundo en que pensabas que viv&iacute;as\\"<br /><br />Con \\"Billy Brown\\" Mika nos cuenta una historia &iquest;ser&aacute; la suya? &iquest;a quien le importa? La canci&oacute;n tiene un humor negro divertido que suena al ritmo de un pianito casi infantil a lo que se suman unos redoblantes, y me recuerda a los Beatles,  y dice \\"Ah Billy Brown hab&iacute;a vivido una vida ordinaria./ Dos ni&ntilde;os, un perro, y una esposa de advertencia./ Mientras esto iba todo seg&uacute;n el plan./ Entonces Billy Brown se enamor&oacute; de otro hombre.<br /><br />La octava pista es un regalo para la belleza real, para las gorditas, \\"Big Girl (You are beautiful)\\" que empieza con el sonido de una sorbida y dice \\"Entr&eacute; a la habitaci&oacute;n/ me sent&iacute;a como si fuera un gran globo/ yo les dije, hey chicas ustedes son hermosas/ quiero una coca diet&eacute;tica y una pizza por favor/ una coca diet&eacute;tica, estoy de rodillas/ gritando chica grande, eres hermosa.\\" 1 Mika 0 Blunt.<br /><br />Y otra vez una canci&oacute;n sentida, que suena a despedida, a amor, a reconocimiento... \\"Stuck in the middle\\" comienza diciendo \\"Me siento y pienso en el d&iacute;a/ en que vayas a morir...\\" y nuevamente ese contraste entre letra y m&uacute;sica piano, bater&iacute;a y coros hacen de esta pieza una rara alegr&iacute;a.<br /><br />Finalmente, \\"Happy Ending\\", donde Mika nos deja escuchar su voz menos chillona, m&aacute;s calmada y melodica acompa&ntilde;ada de un coro que canta \\"Esta es la manera en la que me dejaste, no estoy fingiendo./ Sin esperanza, sin amor, sin gloria, sin final feliz./ Esta es la manera en la que nos amamos, como si fuera para siempre./ Viviremos el resto de nuestra vida, pero no juntos.\\" Y Mika contesta: \\"Me despierto por la ma&ntilde;ana,/ tropezando con mi vida./ No obtendr&eacute; amor sin sacrificio/ Si algo debe pasar, yo deseo que sea bueno/ Que sea un poco de cielo, pero tambi&eacute;n un poco de infierno.\\" Siendo esta la unica canci&oacute;n que podr&iacute;a llegar a sacarme una lagrimita si no contara con ese ritmo refrescante que caracteriza todo el disco.consecuencia natural a la canción anterior, con suficiente irreverencia y trasgresión en la letra: \\"Oye chica por qué no puedes seguir adelante?,/Es porque simplemente tu madre te tiene nublada/ Es un poco fuerte, es como sólo probar para divertirte/ Bueno tu ya no tendrás que pobrar a ningún otro,/ Te haré una amante.\\"    Mika crea una música auténtica, que no anda buscando aprobación, y para mi: lo hace muy bien. Las letras expresan situaciones, emociones y posturas muy sentidas, y en ocasiones sicodélicas y oscuras, mientras la música ofrece en contraposición ritmos alegres y ligeros. A mi me sirve.    En \\"Take it easy\\" canta \\"Relax/ Hay una respuesta a los tiempos más obscuros./ Está claro que no entendemos, pero la última cosa en mi mente/ Es salir de ti./ Creo que estamos en esto juntos./ No grites - hay tantos caminos a la izquierda.    Luego viene una canción melancólica, con coros y violines, llamada \\"Any other world\\" que comienza con una anciana contando cosas tristes y dice la canción \\"...Di adiós a aquel mundo en el que creías que vivías/ inclínate, actúa el papel de un solitario, solitario corazón/ di adiós a aquel mundo en el que pensabas que vivías/ al mundo en que pensabas que vivías\\"    Con \\"Billy Brown\\" Mika nos cuenta una historia ¿será la suya? ¿a quien le importa? La canción tiene un humor negro divertido que suena al ritmo de un pianito casi infantil a lo que se suman unos redoblantes, y me recuerda a los Beatles,  y dice \\"Ah Billy Brown había vivido una vida ordinaria./ Dos niños, un perro, y una esposa de advertencia./ Mientras esto iba todo según el plan./ Entonces Billy Brown se enamoró de otro hombre.     La octava pista es un regalo para la belleza real, para las gorditas, \\"Big Girl (You are beautiful)\\" que empieza con el sonido de una sorbida y dice \\"Entré a la habitación/ me sentía como si fuera un gran globo/ yo les dije, hey chicas ustedes son hermosas/ quiero una coca dietética y una pizza porfavor/ una coca dietética, estoy de rodillas/ gritando chica grande, eres hermosa.\\" 1 Mika 0 Blunt.    Y otra vez una canción sentida, que suena a despedida, a amor, a reconocimiento... \\"Stuck in the middle\\" comienza diciendo \\"Me siento y pienso en el día/ en que vayas a morir...\\" y nuevamente ese contraste entre letra y música piano, batería y coros hacen de esta pieza una rara alegría.    Finalmente, \\"Happy Ending\\", donde Mika nos deja escuchar su voz menos chillona, más calmada y melodica acompañada de un coro que canta \\"Esta es la manera en la que me dejaste, no estoy fingiendo./ Sin esperanza, sin amor, sin gloria, sin final feliz./ Esta es la manera en la que nos amamos, como si fuera para siempre./ Viviremos el resto de nuestra vida, pero no juntos.\\" Y Mika contesta: \\"Me despierto por la mañana,/ tropezando con mi vida./ No obtendré amor sin sacrificio/ Si algo debe pasar, yo deseo que sea bueno/ Que sea un poco de cielo, pero también un poco de infierno.\\" Siendo esta la unica canción que podría llegar a sacarme una lagrimita si no contara con ese ritmo refrescante que caracteriza todo el disco.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Although I'm sure I wore out my vinyl copy of \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" back in the Sixties, I hadn't paid much attention to it since then. When one of my teenage guitar students came to his lesson asking to learn songs from this album I was blown away.<br /><br />This was my excuse to pick up my own copy of this latest edtion of an amazing album. After getting hit with a flood of memories, which included seeing Grace Slick at Fillmore Auditorium while she still did many of these songs with The Great Society, I realized why a teen today would still be attracted to this music. The musicianship here is in top form for a hippie-era psychedelic folk-rock band. The guitars are in tune and tight, and the harmonies are amazing.<br /><br />Many other Sixties-era hippie bands now sound dated. Not so on this recording of Jefferson Airpline. There's a reason why this band rose to the top, and at one point was outselling the Beatles in Bay area record stores.<br /><br />If you're a fan of music from this era, this is a recording to add to your collection. Even the bonus tracks are satisfying. My guitar student is already working hard at playing along with \\"In the Morning,\\" a pretty nice extended blues number.
B000007MVL|4.0|For me this is a notch above her debut (her weakest). i think the first side is a wonder and creates a magical mood -  something very 'otherly' special about those tracks. Unfortuneately this is not quite sustained in the second half. From here on in her discography the number of weak tracks can be counted on one hand and that includes her b sides - she is just ridiculous really.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Every one of the 1 star reviews laments that this is not the Gene Wilder version. Well, duh! And boy do I hate that pointless movie almost as much as the author of the book, Roald Dahl, did. Those dreadful songs by that hack Anthony Newley and dumb looking green faced Oompa Loompas are way worse than any song or Oompa Loompa clone in this version by Burton.    So forgetting that lame musical version from the 70's [which was a box office flop, BTW] what we have here is an imaginative and quirky film that actually, alas, doesn't live up to its potential. Oh the FX is spectacular and imaginative to be sure, and Depp's performance is unique and has zero to do with Michael Jackson....intentionally at any rate, [these get it the 4 stars] but it all adds up to...what? Yes there are lessons to be learned but it's mainly a excessive film about the dangers of excess. And, hello....not all families are great. Some people need to jettison their families in order to become something and feel good. Still, it's something to see!    I believe the backstory about Dr. Wonka, DDS, was originally devised by Dahl himself when he attempted an early screenplay.... so you can complain all you want about that, but let's leave off  the \\"it doesn't fit Dahl's intentions at all\\" argument.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I have never been much of a metal fan. I thought Deep Purple's venture with the Royal Philharmonic was great, but would be the last of its kind when the band went non-classical. I was so disappointed. I then discovered Renaissance and Annie Haslam and have listened to them daily for years. I still do.    I discovered Nightwish by accident when looking for a symphonic rock song I heard on the radio that had haunting beautiful female vocals and a taste of hard symphonic rock (don't you hate it when the DJs don't mention who a song is by?). After searching I found that it was the orchestral version of Pendulum. I bought the CD and discovered the rest.    I view \\"Dark Passion Play\\" as the culmination of all the characteristics I have searched for in what used to called \\"art rock\\". Heavy, symphonic, progressive, and phenomenal female vocals. It is indescribable. Phenomenal is all I can say, and that seems to leave much unsaid. It is just too good. It also strikes me as the band's interpretation of the Book of Revelations. Pushing 60 and my mind can still be blown.
0884271536|5.0|This book is about applying TOC to project management. After reading this book I understood why TOC for project management is not as straight forward as it might first appear. Not only are projects not repeatable like production assembly lines buts in a multi-project environment you need to take shared resources into account. This is even more difficult when the managers for each project are different people. Lessons learned:    - Estimates should be \\"In X days with 50% chance of completion\\"  - Cut estimates in 2 or 3 if suspect that tasks have padding  - All the padding should go for the project but less than sum of padding  - Add time buffers (at no cost) when paths merge with critical path  - If a resource is shared between projects then it may be a bottleneck  - Resource bottlenecks should be treated as such: identify, exploit, subordinate, elevate...  - No due dates so as not to encourage the \\"student syndrome\\"    Of all the business novels by Eli Goldratt, I think that this is the one that I have learned the most from. As with all his novels, it's easy and fun to read with the added benefit that you will have learnt to better manage your projects. A must.
0452289963|5.0|This book is  clear and makes a lot of sense.  The explanation of the egoic mind is illuminating and helpful regarding situations like power struggles, low self-esteem, the need to be right, etc.  Realizing that these uncomfortable human states can be overcome by just the recognition that they are a product of the ego, and that the God(Love) self is always available for a more satisfying interaction, is very freeing and joyous.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim, liking the song \\"Love Song\\" that I've heard on the radio. Honestly, I didn't even bother previewing the rest of the tracks because I just felt like taking a chance that day.<br /><br />I was so very pleasantly surprised when I heard the rest of the album and found that it's all good. After talking to some other friends who had bought it, I can't find anyone who wasn't struck by really how good it is.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Looking forward to the next one.
B00000IWVS|5.0|Martha Argerich's reading of Chopin's Third Sonata is superlative. By turns majestic and athletic in its pacing, this my favorite Third. The disc is worth the opening bars of the final movement alone: there is a drama here in Argerich's playing that is conspicuously absent from most other performances. Brilliant.    The Scherzo No. 3 is similarly outstanding, as are the Mazurkas. Alas, the Polonaise in A-flat is lacking in the same flair and command as the Sonata, which is a disappointment.     The definitive Sonata No. 3, worth the attention of any music lover. (Top notch sonics from a 40+ year old recording also make the recording a gem.)
0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]]<br /><br />This book is a \\"life changing\\" experience.  If you have been looking for a book that may help you experience life in a positive way, this is the book for you.  If you are ready and willing to take the time to read this book, you will never be the same or look at life the same way again..  I have been reading and listening to books of a similar nature for years and have never been affected by any as much as this one.  I thank God for inspiring Eckhart Tolle to write this book.
B000A5044C|5.0|I was product surfing for new films to watch and decided to pick one at random, as this won the Chicago 2004 Film Festival I thought it'd be a good one to pick. It was.     The storyline is simple but captivating in its own way. The story follows 12 year old Akira and his enigmatic, alcoholic, and immature mother whose only real focus is on her new boyfriends and not her kids. After moving to their new home, Akira's mother comes home less and less and eventually leaves a note that she's not coming back forever.     Akira lies to his younger siblings to keep their spirits up, but he has to deal with the truth that he is on his own to take care of his family.     At first he is able to live off the little money his mother sends him, but eventually he becomes broke. He gives his siblings what freedoms he can while keeping them hidden from the landlord or risk being thrown out the the apartment. When they're seen Akira must lie again and tell the landlord that they are his \\"cousins.\\"    After weeks of the strain on money the AC is shut off, the water is shut off, and the electricity too. Akira struggles to find what money he can. He finds some help in a girl named Saki. She tries to offer Akira money but her refuses.     Eventually the strain kicks completely and the strain causes tense rifts in the family that can only be tied together by simple joys of joking around and spending time in the park.     This story is straightforward but speaks in a way that shows the real stages of growing up as well as understanding the world of adults even at a young age.     The heartwarming younger siblings who have to smile and keep Akira going forward make the film what it is. They give a positive unbroken aura of innocence even when Akira must give up his for reality.     I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" or likes realistic films that express important aspects of life as people grow up and move onwards.     This is a job well done and is apiece that greatly deserves praise!
B0010358CG|5.0|If you have a Blu-ray Player then this movie is what you want. I thought the Graphics were jaw-dropping! I hope there will be other movies that use the same kind of graphics and style shown in this movie.
B00133KHCY|3.0|August Rush would probably be considered an interesting film for most, but a fascinating film for music lovers.  A somewhat whimsical tale of a gifted child that never knew his parents.  Gifted in that the child hears music all around him, calling to him, almost begging to be recorded and played for others to enjoy.  Never knowing his parents because he was given up for adoption as a baby.  Hoping to somehow connect to his parents and feeling that perhaps music can bring everyone together.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers (of The Tudors and other works) is the father he never knew.  Working with his more natural accent as an Irish rock and roll band member.  Keri Russell (Felicity and others) is the mother who was a featured member of the Philarmonic.  The two 'hook up' at a party, but are kept apart by her father.  Both are obviously gifted musicians in their own right, so they will of course produce a child prodigy.<br /><br />Mixed in along the way are roles for Robin Williams, Terrence Howard and others that cross paths with the various characters here.  Can fate bring the proper parties together, or can there be no happy ending?  I've probably spoiled (unintentionally) that with my review title, but you've also probably already figured that by the time you read this review or any of the others here (or perhaps you saw the trailers for this film when it was in theatrical release).<br /><br />The film didn't last that long in theatres, apparently not being able to find it's own voice amongst the rush and crush of other choices that potential movie-goers had to spend their entertainment money on.  That's a shame as parts of the film would be wonderful to view on a big screen.  Not that the high definition transfer for the Blu-ray is bad (nor will the same transfer that will be used for the HD DVD release be), or even the image (by what I've seen) for the DVD version.  No, they translate just fine to the smaller screen, but perhaps could be better enjoyed on a larger canvas.<br /><br />The film is obviously about music and the music dominates throughout.  Not overwhelmingly so, but it's obvious that sound is a key element here, and dialogue is used more sparingly in conveying the message and interaction between the characters in the story.  The music is well choosen throughout, and helped to earn the film an Academy Award Nomination for one of it's musical selections.  Unfortunately for this film, there was strong competition from several films, so the prize went elsewhere and the film continued to be largely ignored without the 'bump' of being an Oscar winner.<br /><br />I've rated the film at 3 stars.  Yet again, I think this is a film that deserves a little better, but not that much better.  Some will quite obviously find it quite enjoyable and think that it deserves more.  I understand that thinking and wouldn't argue with those that love the film.  I think most people would enjoy it once through, but not feel compelled to watch it repeatedly.  I could be wrong, but part of what might convince me to purchase a film like this on disc would be having more to explore on the disc.  Unfortunately the studio apparently didn't feel compelled to add much to the disc for this particular under-performer.  A selection of deleted scenes is all that is there.  No making of, no mini-documentary on selecting the music for the film, composing or performing the music, making the actors look believable in being gifted musicians, or anything else.<br /><br />For most people, I'd recommend renting first.  You may throughly enjoy the film and wish to purchase, but you also may feel it was not something you wished to spend too much money on owning.  Try before you buy here if you can.<br /><br />A quick nit to pick here on the film.  The use of time within the film, showing events of the past to set up how these characters got to be where they are in modern time is fine, but in showing the characters before the title character is conceived andborn the parental characters are later surprisingly unchanged and apparently haven't aged a bit.  I realize that depicting a passage of a little more than a decade isn't easy, but at the same time people change.  You don't appear the same at 20 as you would at 30, or at 25 versus 35.  I wish film makers would put a little more effort into noticing such little things so they don't become distractions to films like this, and so that viewers are given more of a sense of a passage of time.anged and apparently haven't aged a bit.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Season after season of smart scripts and great acting make this one of the best TV shows in history. This set of the complete series DVD's are a great value. The extra commentary from the writers, producers and actors is valuable to the diehard fans of this show.
0099532611|1.0|I am afraid I finally have to use this cliche statement: This is really the worst book I have ever read. I wonder why I have even finished reading it. Probably because I wanted to find out what all the Pynchon-hype is about, or because I just expected that the book would take a turn for the better.     Some say that if something is hyped, then it is probably bad. Reading Pynchon has taught me that there is some truth to that. To compare this book or draw an analogy to Ulysses is not only wrong, but also an insult to one of the greatest writers ever.    The book is about a woman who might have or might not have uncovered a conspiracy. In other words, it is about a woman who tries to find meaning in something which probably does not have any. Well, that is certainly reminiscent of Kafka or Beckett. Only that Kafka or Beckett open new doors leading into a different direction on every page, add layer after layer, and truly disturb the reader. In Pynchon, there are no multiple layers. He only scraches the surface without ever adding any depths to his ideas.    \\"Crying of Lot 49\\" is for readers who are very amused about names like Fallopian or Genghis Khan, and think that an idea like the \\"Maxwell Devil\\" is incredibly creative. It is for readers who try to seek for qualities in a book which has none. It is fast-food existentialism for the masses and a total waste of paper.    There are so many good books out there. Don't follow the hype, don't waste your time. Go straight to the real classics.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|Sylvester Stallone Stars as a Vietnam Vet trying to live in the real world again.<br />This in my mind is a solute to the Vietnam Vet that went to do a job and were never recognized for the job they were asked to do, especially by there own country!!<br />He's trying to get to a friends house he hasn't seen since the war, as he's leaving cause he found out his friend was dead a policemen sticks his nose where is doesn't belong.<br />Since Rambo didn't follow the policemens direction and leave town after the policemen dropped him off at the edge of town the policmen puts him in jail.<br />While in jail they try shaving him, he has a flash back to the war like someone is trying to cut him he fights back with the policemen, he kills a couple then gets away from the police station.<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I watched these episodes over a weekend, and have already signed up to be notified when the next season is released.  The episodes are enthralling -there's a lot more to the series than the gimmick of a serial killer who works for the police.  I have friends waiting in line to borrow these DVDs.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|American, Susie Banion, has just started at the prestigious Tam Dance Academy in Switzerland, but something isn't quite right. On the day she arrives, one of her fellow pupils is murdered, and in the weeks that follow a number of strange occurrences happen. Could it be that the dance academy is really run by a coven of witches? Why would a coven of witches even want to run a dance academy in the first place?<br /><br />Along with Dario Argento's previous film, \\"Deep Red\\", \\"Suspiria\\" is considered to one of Argento's masterpieces. I recently watched both films, one after the other, and in my opinion, although \\"Deep Red\\" has the better plot (\\"Suspiria\\" is barely coherent at times), visually, \\"Suspiria\\" is the better film. Dario Argento is renowned for making some of the most visually stunning horror movies of all time (this man can make a gory murder a thing of beauty) and in \\"Suspiria\\" he has some of the most visually stylish shots of his career and of any film that I have ever seen. \\"Suspiria\\" also has a chilling score, written by the Goblins, that perfectly sets the scene and is my favourite score of all time.<br /><br />\\"Suspiria\\" is the first film in Argento's \\"The Three Mothers\\" trilogy, the second film being \\"Inferno\\", and the third film being the recently released \\"Mother of Tears\\", which was made 30 years after \\"Suspiria\\".

B00133KFGW|5.0|So, why another glowing review.  Everything has been said in the 60+ reviews already on this page and mine will likely never even be read!    Why? Because this movie engages the senses (an amazing score, lush cinematography) and touches the heart from start to finish in ways quite unexpected and rare for films these days. It's a stunner and it makes you want to stand up and clap with joy, (or go on record on Amazon with an enthusiastic review!!)      It is a beautiful fable, a metaphor for a deep and abiding truth that we are all interconnected and can 'listen' and 'hear' the harmonic of love that connects us.  The talented young actor who carries this film (Freddie Highmore) expresses the purity, innocence, and sense of wonder that lies within each of us -- evoked so beautifully in this timeless fable of 'yearning for Home' and 'dreams come true.' And any viewer (of any age - even the most jaded and cynical, I promise you) can relate to this universal theme and (perhaps in spite of oneself) feel uplifted.    This simple little film is a beauty.  It is more than the sum of its parts.  See this film, please!  You'll skip with a lighter step if you do.
B0010Z32OA|5.0|I will start by saying that I have never heard of the book, but after watching the film I think I shall have to read it.  Yes, this is one of those rare movies that makes you say such a thing - simply wonderful.  Now then, on to the review (without giving away the plot)...    This film has a little bit of something for everybody.  It contains a classic fairytale formula - royalty, a beautiful girl, and of course some ugly villains!  It's a fantasy to be sure - swords and sorcery, horses and castles, surrealy-beautiful landscapes.  And it is a rollicking adventure that spans land, air and sea.  Top it all off with some very heartwarming romance and a kind of ephemeral beauty, and you've got a most unusual - and surprisingly enthralling - film of surprisingly good depth.    This is a beautiful film.  It is well suited to couples, but I strongly suspect that any thoughtful individual will find it to be an enchanting experience that will haunt their thoughts for quite some time.  There are comments on humanity in general and love in particular in this film that transcend the screen.  Perhaps a wee bit heady for the very very young - but certainly appropriate for teenagers and up.    In short - this is a gem of a film.  Do yourself a favor: make 2 hours of time in which you won't be interrupted, settle down on a comfortable couch, and savor the experience of a film that doesn't feel like it was made in Hollywood.
0143038419|5.0|What more can one say about this runaway hit that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />So I will simply add my kudos to the countless praises already heaped (deservingly so) on Elizabeth Gilbert. What a great idea for a book! How fortunate that she had a publisher who would support her and allow her to take a flyer on this project!<br /><br />The book is an entertaining, sassy, bold, witty, insightful, vulnerable, intimate confession/quest that is refreshingly well written. It makes one hungry--for good food, a rigorous, supported spiritual practice, and a healthy love--not so much for a beautiful Brazilian man or woman--but for oneself.<br /><br />That's the real lesson Gilbert learned and has to share with us. We cannot live our lives to their fullest potentials until we learn how to love ourselves. In her book, THE AGE OF MIRACLES, Marianne Williamson (another Goddess among us) shares the insight that the universe's job is not trying to give us what we want, it's teaching us how to love. That's it, exactly, as Gilbert well knows.<br /><br />May she continue to sleep well, watched over by her four spirit brothers who represent strength, friendship,  intelligence, and poetry. Yes, poetry!<br /><br />--Robert McDowell, The Poetry Mentor ([...] is the author of POETRY AS SPIRITUAL PRACTICE (July 15th, 2008) from Free Press.
B0013FBS20|2.0|ok the book may be older but isnt this just the new york version of 28 days later, but with less character investment and a very docile washy story line.  My recomendation is watch 28 days later or even the resident evil trilogy, maybe day of the dead, all far better.  Why did Will Smith choose to do this one? he is normally amazing at choosing roles.  Big disapointment
0143143492|2.0|The advertisements on this book were interesting.  I haven't gotten very far.  Eckhart Tolle's writings are enlightening.  However, his oral presentation is totally void of modulation which makes it difficult to stay with him for long periods.  In light of this it will take some time before I can give a complete review.
B0010X745K|3.0|*Just a heads up, Spoilers ahead*<br /><br />I just got finished watching \\"The Mist\\" and am not sure what to think. I guess I'll figure it out by the end of the review. The story is centered around a small town community that undergoes a big storm leaving the townspeople in a panic. As they all head to a small local grocery store a strange mist comes upon the entire area. Those in the store are warned by an olderman that there is something in the mist that killed one of his friends. He urges for everyone to stay inside but there are always a few hard headed folks that just won't listen. As they go into the mist they quickly disappear leaving only a terrified scream behind.<br /><br />As the story moves forward we begin to see some interesting creatures. I was impressed by the visuals with the creatures being very different then what you usually see in these type films. At this point we have a few battles that all take place inside the grocery store once some of the creatures get inside. Besides fighting off creatures they also have to deal with an overly preachy townswoman that I was begging to see killed off. She will drive you to the brink of insaity, trust me. The film then begins to turn more toward showing how humanity deals with life threatening situations by turning on each other. I could have done without this idea. I really just want to watch a fun film without having to see someones opinions rolled into it. I feel it also made the film drag on. There was a bit too much focus on this topic.<br /><br />I'm not going to give the ending away but will say that it is very morbid. It definately wasn't the ending I was expecting. However I will give it credit since it was different from a mainstream hollywood ending. So overall I thought it was decent just way too long. It could have been wrapped up much quicker. I recommend checking it out but only as a rental.
B00005JPTK|3.0|This movie is OK at best. It really didn't live up to all the hype. It could have been better.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|alright lets keep this short and sweet.  if you want to know what's included in this box set, special features and such, check the product info it's all right there.      now how do things look?  as someone who's purchased blade runner no less than 3 times, wait make that 4 now, i can honestly say this is the best version out there.  it's amazing how good this film looks on HD considering it's age.  and don't get me wrong, it's not a good looking film for it's age, it's simply a gorgeous film by any standards.  the new 1080p transfer just looks beautiful.  if you love blade runner, buy this ... or the blu ray version since they are identical.  since HDdvd bit the dust recently i picked up this version, significantly cheaper.  anyway, whichever HD version you buy will no doubt leave you speechless for some time.  flawless.

But it DID grow on me but I don't think it would be good enough to fit the album.<br /><br /> This CD would be the one to get if it weren't 32 bucks. So save yourself some trouble and just download Punchdrunk. It's fantastic. Surely, you already have the album.

B0013FBS20|4.0|like many others who've caught the HD bug, i've become addicted to buying blu-ray discs in an endless search to find the highest quality video image available.  in this regard \\"i am legend\\" does not disappoint.      regardless of how you feel about the film you can't argue with this pristine 1080p VC-1 transfer.  the level of fine detail is simply astonishing, check out any closeup of will smith and marvel at the crispness of the image.  seeing individual pores in an actors face might be off-putting to some, but this is what HD is all about.  this is truly demo disc material.  the only problem, if you consider it such, is that video at this level of clarity and richness shows off any single flaw in the film.  in this case the cg.  every cg shot looks incredibly phony, specifically because the image is so clear.  i've watched the standard def release as well, and while the cg isn't overwhelmingly convincing there, it looks much more like an in-camera element as opposed to a cartoon dropped into the real world.  anyway, that's a fault with the film and not with the disc.  great disc.  oh, it also includes an alternate version which, in my opinion, makes for a much better story than the theatrical cut.  check this out, you won't want to miss it.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|planet earth is the only documentary of its kind, which means it can't really be compared to anything else because of the sheer scope of the project.  the visuals are, by and large, beautiful and worthy of being preserved for posterity.  if nothing else, planet earth deserves awards for capturing images never before seen on film, and quite possibly never to be seen again.    the product itself: what are you getting?    there are 11, 50 minute episodes contained on 4 discs.  this series was shot on HD video, which is much easier to lug around than traditional film based cameras.  unfortunately that difference often shows, particularly in darker portions of an image or at long distances.  the result is a great deal of grain or static, artifacts that just look horrible compared to everything else you'll be seeing.  i mention this because it is very noticeable without trying to be picky, and since all the other images look so beautiful.    also worth note is that not everything was shot on HD, contrary to a lot of the publicity material you've likely been reading.  night vision scenes, as well as some other seemingly random scenes have been shot on traditional video.  it still looks good, but not great.      considering that this has been billed as THE HD nature documentary, it loses one star for spotty image problems.  part of this problem is the limitation of HD video, part if is likely due to poor authoring.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is the most exciting new singer of romance/opera this decade.  His voice incorporates a very unique carisma that seems to caress your psyche.  When I listen to him singing, I am spiritually refreshed.
B00005JPTK|3.0|This film could have been great and it starts out that way. Unfortunately, it goes seriously awry in the second half. It's hard to believe as you watch this film unravel from near masterpiece to typical Hollywood action fare.<br /><br />The film is interesting and entertaining to a point, it just has a very unsatisfying ending and it could have used some narration. The narration could have helped explain some things going on, like where are the generators for electricity you have in your house and what is that stuff he poured on his steps etc.etc. etc.?! The CGI creatures are not all that convincing, but I could have lived with that had the film followed the original story. This could have been one of the best Sci-Fi films in history, but it's destined to be forgotten. I think the 'The Omega Man' despite it's flaws is a better film and 'The Last Man On Earth' is too, at least those films had some guts!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the two disc edition is terrible! The only extra feature you get is an alternate version of the movie which is only the last few minutes. The alternate ending is not as good as the theatrical one, but strangely enough both versions have some good points and some really bad ones. If this film had followed the book closer it would have been great, as it is, it's not even on par with 'The Omega Man' or 'The Last Man On Earth'!
B00005JPTK|5.0|Will Smith was GREAT in this movie, I only wish that this would have continued on a little longer showing more about how people became extinct and have them actually cure some of those night seekers/zombies after he realized that he figured out the cure. Plus I would have liked to see him try to save his dog by maybe tying her up in a enclosed area like he did to the night seeker/zombie. Hopefully there will be a sequel.
B0013FFMOK|3.0|Seemed  short and the CGI was a little too cartoony. I didn't like the ending either. And once Neville did his  sacrifice, I was done with this film. This DVD didn't include any good features either. I'd play I A L, if it were a FPS though.
B0010358D0|3.0|while the cg style of animation was very lush and stimulating, the plot unfortunately was not.  if you like grand action sequences and don't mind a storyline and ending you can see coming a mile away, then you shouldn't be disappointed.  On a side note: John Woo needs to give the doves a rest. Yeah we know your trademark John but you were just a producer on this one so quit stroking your own ego and go spend some of your big pile of money.
B0010358D0|4.0|Lets start from the top..<br />The case this movie comes in is insanely nice- high definition printing-gloss metallic shine on aluminum and it's a book styled case-in fact its exactly the same type of case that the Gits SCC special edition movie came in...disk one contains the movie and some extras, disk two contains a \\"definitive history of Appleseed\\"..and some art doc about anime..i tend to find that while the \\"history\\" is very cool the rest of it is rather useless..I would have preferred some sort of enhanced soundtrack disk..also whats cool about this package is that you get a mini Appleseed Dark Horse comic. Very cool!<br /><br />Story mechanics:<br />Story wise I would like to think that Exmachina is like the episode 2 of the first movie that was left out...sorta... cause it just kind of starts...not like the massive entrance sequence from the first...Now overall once it gets moving its actually rather quite solid...once thing leads to another..and the story makes actual sense...unlike in the previous movie where it was one chop after another.. Although while its solid there are elements of it that are direct copies from other movies and it's a blatant. The giant floating announcement ship with digital signs: Blade Runner, The \\"swarm\\" of flying drones and there behavior- Matrix Revolutions, \\"we are all one\\"-Star Trek Voyager.. And the list goes on and on and on...I mean were talking over 40% of story is ripped from other media...BUT even with all of this the mix seems very unique and futuristic ..its just not that original ..but flipside wise it  also matches the Appleseed universe pretty well. This Story is also more mature than the previous story line..much in the way that Second Gig was a major mature shift for the Gits Franchise- death, cussing, terrorists, murder, riots, and plenty of  violence..Although all in all its entertaining and yes the story has depth to it...finally!<br /><br />Graphics:  MASSIVE upgrade from the first movie...very well thought out...Tons of awesome camera work...for anime its right up there with Ergo Proxy and Advent when it comes to shear graphics capability..the animation is also far more detailed...its right on par with the times..and OH YEA TONS OF ACTION!!! gotta hand it to Woo and Aramaki...pretty good!!<br /><br />Voice: American voice cast is top notch!!!!..they all sound very intense and the lines are pretty good..granted some are cheesy<br /><br />Overall: strangely enough I like this better than the first movie..i guess just cause its darker and more involved...and a heck of allot more realisticmera work...for anime its right up there with Ergo Proxy and Advent when it comes to shear graphics capability..the animation is also far more detailed...its right on par with the times..and OH YEA TONS OF ACTION!!! gotta hand it to Woo and Aramaki...pretty good!!

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm a serious fan of the 1995 BBC version. It's still the best P&P adaptation to date. That said, Joe Wright's updated version is the one that gets the most play in my house. The characters have been given a free run of the house. There's plenty of dancing, laughter, running about. It's Austen on hormones. The emotions are pumped up and the drama heightened. The cinematography is just gorgeous but the best element is the soundtrack, hauntingly beautiful and difficult to get out of your head. Whatever your preference, there's always room for more Jane Austen. And the sight of Darcy striding over the hill at sunrise .. a jaw-dropper.
B0011FXLCC|3.0|I like Goldfrapp--I have all four of their cds. Beyond this simple fact things become more complicated. For example, I can't help but feel that Goldfrapp are re-treading ground already covered by Roxy Music, Eurythmics, Kate Bush, and more recently, Dido and Morcheeba. So I have the feeling of, \\"What else have you got to offer?\\"<br /><br />I also have the feeling that Goldfrapp haven't quite figured out their true musical identity yet. \\"Felt Mountain\\" was quiet ambience like Mazzy Star or Loreena McKennitt, then \\"Black Cherry\\" went more into Eurythmics and Depeche Mode territory, followed by \\"Supernature\\" which delved even further into Eurythmics back catalogue. Now we have \\"Seventh Tree\\" which seems to be a hybrid of \\"Felt Mountain\\" and \\"Black Cherry\\". I can't say this is a progression. In fact, I was hoping they would take their electronic approach to a new level and try something really daring, but no, they take a step back to their roots (rather early in their career I think).<br /><br />If I like Goldfrapp, then why three stars you might ask? Well, one of the issues I have with the duo is that on each of their cds they pick a sound and stick with it, with not as much variation as I would prefer. The same is true of \\"Seventh Tree\\". Ambient all the way through with little variety. Still, each Goldfrapp cd has something good about it. In this case, I found myself liking \\"Happiness\\", \\"Road To Somewhere\\", \\"A&E\\", \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" and \\"Caravan Girl\\". \\"Clowns\\" and \\"Eat Yourself\\" would be my next choices. \\"Little Bird\\" and \\"Monster Love\\" are next, and then the weakest track has to be \\"Some People\\".<br /><br />A word about the packaging. Will Gregory looks like he's 60 years old in the terrible picture on the insert. Underneath the cd, in the jewel case, you have a drawing of a nude woman with an owl head--what? You open up the insert completely and you have a person in a giant owl costume consuming Alison Goldfrapp who is dressed like a carnival clown. Hmmm. I know Annie Lennox was challenging with her orange hair buzz cut and business suit attire in \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\\", but what exactly are Goldfrapp going for?<br /><br />I'm hoping the next Goldfrapp cd will be more daring and less sleep inducing.allenging with her orange hair buzz cut and business suit attire in \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\\", but what exactly are Goldfrapp going for?

0618918248|1.0|Be alert people!  The high priest of atheism is out to convert you, and he wants your children too.    Richard Dawkins in his book The God Delusion recounts how newly-hatched atheists have come under his wings, even as he struggles to fight away tears prompted by the neophytes' conversion stories (see especially 322-325).  Usually the stories involve a perceived or real abuse by a religious figure (including well-meaning, but deluded parents), and the stories end with an encounter with one of Dawkins' holy books propelling the reader into the warm embrace of the author:  \\"What took you so long, my dear?\\" one can almost hear Dawkins say.    Believers know (only too well, sadly) that faith and religion have been used by people for evil purposes.  Dawkins' mind cannot admit any good purpose for religion beyond consolation (more tears here; see p349).  In fact, Dawkins thinks that it is reasonable and logical and even caring to prohibit parents from teaching their children the ways of faith.  (He quotes approvingly someone named Nicholas Humphrey who advocates the frightening idea that society should systematically \\"protect\\" children from the religious influence of parents, 326, an idea that should send chills down any parent's spine).  Children are not old enough to choose what they believe, Dawkins says.  And yet in the same breath Dawkins comes out with this sentence:  \\"The important point is that it is their [i.e., the children's] privilege to decide what they shall think, and not their parents' privilege to impose it by force majeure\\" (327).  He does not explain how a child who is too young to choose a religion is old enough to choose between scientific materialism and religious belief.  However, that all moms and dads should teach their children to think critically is an important parental responsibility.  Blessed with such instruction, the grown children will be able to reject the--amazingly--uncritical thought of Dawkins in The God Delusion.    For example, Dawkins lumps all believers together in one gigantic, sad, naïve, deluded mix, although he is able to maintain a special scorn for believers who actually embrace God's gift of science along with the gift of faith.  Such a pairing, he says, is impossible, illogical, and completely incredible, unless the believer has sinister motives.  Needless to say, there is great diversity among believers of all faiths.  Some \\"believers\\" never question anything, whereas others think it a duty to deepen the human understanding of reality for their personal welfare and for the common good.  His treatment of Scripture is pathetic.  One would assume that an educated man would be aware of all the varied approaches to studying the Bible, like form theory and the historical-critical method, among others.  But Dawkins' never ventures into the area of critical analysis; he never bothers to consider serious biblical scholars; he simply pronounces that most \\"sophisticated Christians\\" do not take the Bible literally (Dawkins is unaware, presumably, of the multivalence of the word \\"literal\\") or historically.  He dismisses the person of Jesus in the same uncritical way, never once looking seriously at the extra-biblical evidence or arguments pro Jesus.  Dawkins does not prove his point; he does not give us contrasting examples; he cites \\"experts\\" who are sympathetic to him and then he makes a declaration.    This, by the way, is Dawkins' favorite rhetorical device.  He begins with anecdotes about religion (all of them negative, reprehensible, and absurd examples), then he massages the mind of the reader with warm enticements:  of course enlightened, sophisticated, intelligent, thinking people understand what I am saying.  Then he unleashes the coup de grace that (to his mind) undercuts religion.  Dawkins (unwittingly?) places himself in the role of the serpent who tried the same strategy with Eve:  compliment the great, god-like intellect of the human person and then wrap him (her) in your coils.Dawkins is a skillful writer, and he uses rhetoric cunningly.  As I was reading, I was trying to anticipate how he would answer the question about the origin of life. He precedes the section on the origin of life with a primer on natural selection, and feigns surprise that theists would accept natural selection as a method used by God.  Again, he does not say why an active, omnipotent God could not use natural selection, he simply says it's untrue (and disrespectful to any all-powerful being worthy of the name).  As the reader moves closer and closer to the big question about the origin of life, he or she is confronted with an argument Dawkins names the \\"anthropic principle\\".  One must read the anthropic argument for oneself to be fair to Dawkins (134-150), but I will try to summarize it here.  Basically, the fact that we are now living (as well as all other living things) means that at some point the conditions for life on this planet were met.  The origin of life is a highly improbable event, Dawkins says, especially given all the millions and millions of stars and planets floating around in space, but we know it did happen because we are here.  How did this highly improbable event take place?  Luck.  This is Dawkins' explanation of the origin of life:  it happened by pure luck.  DNA came about by luck, and then natural selection kicked in (meaning no more luck or chance).  What kicked in for me after reading this was surprise:  This is what I plowed through four chapters to read?    I hate to draw the comparison, but Dawkins sounds very much like a religious fanatic.  Where did all those planets and stars come from in the first place?  He never considers this question, and I assume he wants the reader to accept that matter has always been floating around space just waiting for that lucky moment for life to begin.  But isn't saying that pure luck is a better answer (or more scientific) than God as the cause of the origin of life simply a pre-determined result of Dawkins' philosophical presuppositions about reality?  Dawkins may wave a hand at Aquinas and Anselm for concluding a First Cause (read God), but the notion that Someone started everything is at least as reasonable, if not more than reasonable, than asserting the happy meeting of matter and luck.    Pardon me, but Pope Benedict XVI has a better assertion to offer.  Before he became pope, Benedict published his Introduction to Christianity (San Francisco:  Ignatius Press, 1990, English translation) which presents what Christians believe and why.  In Part I, chapter IV (151-161), the pope writes about God and the origin of life.  As is the case with Dawkins' anthropic principle, the pope's argument must be read to be appreciated fully, but I will try to summarize it here.  The pope writes that everything that exists ipso facto participates in being.  Human beings know that they are not the cause of their own being.  They also know that many things made by human hands were first thought and then made out of existing matter.  But where did the matter come from?  The pope writes that thought precedes matter.  God thought matter into existence.    Dawkins of course would dismiss the pope's idea as a fairy tale.  But again it is at least as reasonable as Dawkins' own notion of always-existing matter banging together at one lucky moment and producing life.  However, I guess readers should not be surprised that Dawkins presents a seamless and pure argument.  He certainly would be foolish to allow other views or arguments (considered fully and critically) to take away from his crystal clear presentation.  Dawkins always presents himself as genuinely baffled that people, and especially fellow scientists, could believe in God.  And certainly we cannot doubt his sincerity when he concludes (as he does on almost every page) that if people were smart like him, then the world would be free from war and hatred and ignorance (not to mention parental guidance).  Still, Dr. Dawkins can have his delusion.  As for me, to quote Scripture, I will serve the Lord.
B0006L89N8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this book. I thought it would be basic and just hit on certain aspects of both sexes. Luckily I found this book incredibly detailed as to how both sexes can understand one another. With this in mind we'll have a better response to situations that arise. It uses a bit of humor when explaining how men and women think and react to certain situations. This book explains how both are different but when they understand and realize that they compliment one another. I would recommend this to anyone who always is confused as to how the other sex thinks and works. We are very different and this book does a GREAT job of opening our eyes to how it really is rather than how it should be.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I was a bit skeptical watching a movie with a full soundtrack from the beatles and a semi-romantic story plot. However, this movie really blew me away, I thought it was incredible and the remixed versions of the song are great. I downloaded a few of those afterwards as well.
0385338724|5.0|I love the Shopaholic series and have enjoyed Kinsella's other stand alone novels, but this one I loved.  Kinsella has created a believable gal, struggling to find her way with wonderful humor as only this author can do.  It's a fun, enjoyable read.
0765318741|3.0|Richard Matheson has crafted a clever (relatively) modern-day tale of the undead.  I have not yet seen the recent DVD movie which was based on the book, but I suspect there are many dissimilarities.<br /><br />Caveat for those picking up the paperback version -- be aware that much of the book consists of unrelated short stones by Matheson.  This is not made clear to readers or buyers of the book up front, which can be confusing when you transition from \\"I Am Legend\\" to \\"Buried Talents.\\"
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Do yourself a favor: go to \\"amazon.co.uk\\" and order the UK version--if you already have an Amazon account, then you're all set.  The UK DVD is only for region 2 DVD players, so do yourself a second favor and order a region-free DVD player (if you don't already have one).    The film is great and if you're a GITS fan, then you'll want the English language version, since it has the cast who provided the voices for the SAC series.  Also if you don't mind some minor inconsistencies--since the film and TV versions of GITS actually exist in seperate continuities--this film fits in nicely between the events of GITS: S.A.C. 2nd GIG and the Solid State Society OVA.  I know there are some GITS fans who prefer the Oshii films and shun the TV series and vice versa--but I see it as all fitting into the same universe (if you don't mind the small inconsitencies).    Please don't waste your money on Dreamworks and their less-than-acceptable DVD--send the money to folks who cared enough to put out a worthy version of Mamoru Oshii's film!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly like its namesake flared brightly and faded away.  I recommend this highly, but with a warning.  You will be hooked and wanting more.  You will become resentful of the garbage on television now.  You will wonder how shows like \\"The Simple Life\\" gets four seasons, but this show gets pulled before it airs all the episodes it taped.<br /><br />There has never been anything even remotely close to this concept, so I guess the majority of people just didn't \\"get it\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is yet another wondrous show created by the genius that is Joss Whedon and it's really a pity that it was canceled so early in its infancy.       This program takes place in outer space during the year 2517 at a time when only two superpowers, The United States and China, have survived over the years. The plot focuses on a Firefly-class spaceship called Serenity and its crew, which consists of Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, Zoe Washburne, an old war buddy of Mal's, Hoban \\"Wash\\" Washburne, the ship's pilot and Zoe's husband, Inara Serra, a renowned Companion, Jayne Cobb, Kaylee Frye, the ship's mechanic, Shepherd Book, a pastor with a murky past, Dr. Simon Tam, and his sister, the mysterious River Tam. In order to survive they must do jobs, often illegal ones, for people all while hiding from a government agency looking to capture a certain passenger on board. Each action-packed heist will leave you begging for more. Not only are the episodes comedic and exciting, but the writing is top-notch and the characters are interesting and well-developed.      Firefly was truly nothing short of brilliant. I own the complete series on DVD and have watched the episodes so often that I could probably quote every line back to you but it seems no matter how many times I see them I'm still on the edge of my seat. The DVD set comes with some interesting bonus features and every episode is organized in the order the show was originally supposed to be run.  :]
B00005JPTK|1.0|Nothing like the book it was based on...the animation is terrible and cartoonish, the story jumps around all over the place...watch it once to get it out of your system.   Now go read the BOOK for a much better experience!!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|My boyfriend and I spend plenty of time watching movies of all genres, but rarely do we feel elevated for having spent the time absorbed in \\"movie reality\\".  We finished the film (though some say it is on the long side, I disagree-- we were shocked at how fast the time flew by while watching) and felt elevated by its sweet tale and the opportunity to flash back to a world that had a haunting political similarity to today, with its unpopular foreign war and horribly disabled veterans.  We had been discussing the notion that kids today would benefit from a re-do of the musical Hair.  Well, this movie is a modern day Hair, and with much cooler special effects.  I bought a copy of this for myself, and one for my parents.  Perfect Boomer movie-- I strongly recommend!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I know the graphics aren't state of art anymore. But the story and the characters make this a great movie for kids & adults. We wore out our first copy and just bought another. Timeless.
B00005JPTK|5.0|If you are considering this, you have already seen it, so I won't review the movie.  To help those deciding on the 2 disc special edition:  It contains an alternate ending.  If you prefer happy endings where the hero lives, this is the version for you.  If you prefer the original bitter sweet ending, save the $$ and go for the regular version.
0143038583|5.0|The first sectio of the book was by far the best part but the rest of the book was enjoyable as well. I have sworn off of \\"processed beef\\" and have taken a good look at my HFCS based diet that this country forces upon us. This is a truly eye opening book and really makes it clear how corporations care more about turning a buck than turning out a healthy product. If not for the organic farmers we would be a doomed society.<br />I am still eating meat but I am much more aware of what I am puttig into my body and have noticed a GREAT difference since I began.<br />Do yourself a favor and read at LEAST the first 1/3 of this book. It will disgust you into action.
B0010V4TZU|2.0|Vampire Weekend. Self Titled? Creative. As I listened to the album I realized I constantly felt like I was in Garden State 2. I thought Zach Braff was gonna show up and say \\"Good Tunes, right?\\". I know \\"hipster\\" types will probably love this album more than getting asymmetrical haircuts, but I just don't get it. The music isn't \\"bad\\", but its just not great either. Its just kind of there. Perpetually going but not really doing anything. Its more like if paint drying had a theme song it would be Vampire Weekend. If my Grandma came over I might put on this album because I know there is no way it will give her a heart attack. That's kind of what this album is. It just is.    How can Vampire weekend make an album with out having any sort of crescendo? Its like they decided to do a concept album where they wanted to put lyrics to elevator music.    Don't get me wrong, I can see how people might enjoy Vampire Weekend. They have the \\"hipster\\" sound. Under produced, weird lyrics, the vocal track is pushed to the front,.....etc., but I usually like my music with a pulse.    At least Walcott is decent.
0143113100|5.0|I loved this book! I am not sure about the accuracy of everything stated within it but it defintely has opened my eyes to a new way of looking at things. This is not a \\"Take care of your brain\\" manual but more of a \\"Your brain is amazing!\\" book. It is a good read- fairly balanced between medical mumbo jumbo and layman's terms. I HIGHLY recommend it for those who want to learn more about their brains and how amazing they really are.
B000W74EQC|5.0|I didn't expect (like some people here) a word by word adaptation.  The language of movies are very different from the books.  But Columbus has made a very beautiful film based on the delicious book.  Buy it and enjoy ir for life.  Buy this widescreen version that unfornately is not sold in Brazil.<br />Em português:  Eu não esperava (como algumas pessoas aqui) uma adaptação literal do livro.

B0013F0L96|5.0|Americana, frankly, at its best. Thats what I feel when listening to a John Mellencamp record. JM is at a minimum, truly an equal to any of the greatest writer/ singers, if not the greatest, in my opinion. Comparisons are really not relevant, as music is subjective anyway.    Big Daddy is the album that brought me back to JM after a few years of trendy listening. \\"Theo and Weird Henry\\" specifically, for whatever reason, resonate in my soul, and always make me want to break out in a deadhead style solo dance around the house. The opening chords, like an explosion of foreboding, just MOVE me. John's expressed sympathies, his sincerity, are for me, expressions of desire for real American values; the kind called for in our declaration of Independence. Inalienable rights, humanist values, truly independent thought. Sad depiction of the propaganda of our times when John and his thoughts are labeled \\"lefty\\".    This album is in a PERFECT spot in the progression of his catalogue. Frankly, as good as it gets for me.     Thank you John!

This laugh out loud satire of course takes it to the extreme, but it is a fun movie.  As the movie switches back and forth between the present and the past, we see how they were tortured in high school.  Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow act well together with great screen presence.  The supporting cast is priceless!  Well done comedy!

B0011ZNAIC|3.0|My husband and I enjoyed watching this movie but there were two things we didn't like for kids.<br /><br />1) It is one of those movies where you can't get to the menu until you watch all the previews and one of the previews is pretty scary if you have smaller children.<br /><br />2) There is a joke about the bee and the girl in the movie making a suicide pack.  I just don't find this funny at all in a movie made for kids.
0743454529|1.0|Characters are one-dimensional predictable. The legal scenes are improbable: no judge would have permitted Sara to represent herself. Honestly, Brian...could you please be any sappier?  The ending ruined the entire story for me and I felt it was completely not necessary.  Why the author decided to take the easy way out and wrap up the book is a question we should ponder.  And what became of Jessie, I mean after the rain storm.  I am sorry I wasted my time on this book.
B00005JPSM|1.0|The only redeeming feature of this film were the images of the food, which looked delicious.  So kudos to the prop master.  Pity the rest of the film made me sick.  Tripe may be a delicacy, but not on film.  This film plods along like dinner at the Olive Garden; wait 45 minutes for something to happen (get a table; plot development), wait another 30 minutes for something to happen (see your waiter; plot development), wait another 45 minutes for something to happen (get your mediocre food; plot development), and then realize that the whole thing was a disappointing waste of time.      Kate and Nick, the not-so-dynamic duo, should have been pastry chefs, because this film is all about empty calories; saccharine sweetness for the film diabetic.  Here is the synopsis: High strung woman (HSW) ends up with kid who is broken up about her mother's death until she gets her stuffed menagerie back.  HSW meets boy, doesn't like boy.  Little girl \\"tricks\\" HSW into liking boy.  Boy starts taking over HSW's restaurant.  Actually, that's about all I know because I decided I would rather sleep than waste more time on this film.  But here's a bold prediction: HSW breaks up with boy, little girl does something cute to get them back together, little girl does a burlesque to the memory of mom - oh wait, wrong movie.      Ultimately this film should have been called \\"No Reason.\\"  As in, there was no reason for this film to have been made.  It's theater fodder and rental chain fluff.  I will not denigrate women by calling this a \\"chic flick,\\" as I watched it with three women, all of whom thought it was vapid nonsense.  This movie is what happens when somebody in Hollywood watches too much Food Network and buys a sausage grinder.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|People seem to differ in their opinions about acting, sets, plot, character development, antagonists, sympathetic characters. This DVD excells in every category. It holds the audiences attention, it's prestine in every area of film making from production to finished work.<br /><br />You will find that this DVD can hold its own and you don't need the trilogy, but having the trilogy makes the genre more understanable.<br /><br />Great film making y'all.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Although I'm not willing for Stargate to end, this movie really did tie in so many things in a short time period! It had the usual adventure, humorous lines, chemistry between the characters and feel good quality.     It was amazing to me that a movie could concisely put all the loose ends together and this one did it VERY well!  You'll definitely want to buy this one and add it to your Stargate SG1 collection!
B000PY52EU|3.0|Black Snake Moan isn't awful, but it didn't miss by much.  Two fine performances, Ricci and Jackson, stop the bleeding.  The blame for BSM belongs entirely to Craig Brewer who wrote and directed.  Many of you will recall his earlier effort, Hustle & Flow, starring Terrence Howard as Djay, the pimp who couldn't slap straight.  I don't know about you, but as far as I'm concerned, no matter how hard it is out there for a pimp, it's not hard enough.  Hustle & Flow, despite a brilliant performance by Howard, was poorly conceived and very badly written.<br /><br />BSN is just as ludicrous, but Brewer has cleverly reversed some cliches.  Rae, Ricci, is a sex addict, while Lazarus, Jackson, is morally upright, fighting demons.  When he chains her to his radiator - a slight, sexually charged white woman imprisoned by a large, imposing black man - the overtones of America's colorful past are loud.  Most notable of all about this film is Ms. Ricci's body.  After growing chubbier and chubbier apparently she has taken the bull by the horns and gone to one of those top-secret Hollywood fat farms.  She looks fantastic.  So much so that she must have had a clause written into her contract specifying that at least 90% of her on screen minutes be spent showing at least 80% of her skin.  I'm not complaining but - enough already - you got the job!<br /><br />For a film with a blues song as a title, and bonus features of Sun House, BSM gets low grades for music.  With a show of hubris quite common today, Jackson actually sings and plays guitar, Ricci sings as well.  This obnoxious arrogance calls to mind an obvious question - When was the last time you saw the Funkadelics perform Shakespeare in the park?  From Walk The Line to Ray and so many others, actors feel qualified to sing, it's a mystery.  Another puzzle is the highly charged name, Lazarus.  While the biblical reference is obvious, surely Mr. Brewer knows the rule for naming blues musicians.  After all, the song, Black Snake Moan, was recorded by Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1927.  (Infirmity-Fruit-Name of President).  A name like Gimpy Kumquat Taft would have served admirably.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is less horrible than one would expect (whew!) while S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as always.  The third act, the resolution, is appallingly facile.  Ricci is an amazing actress, she has a lot of room to work, and she shines.  Jackson is blessed with on screen gravitas; he holds your attention throughout.  If you can ignore the poor direction and sheer stupidity of the story, you'll enjoy the picture.by Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1927.  (Infirmity-Fruit-Name of President).

It does help to have some knowledge of anatomy, but if you don't, you can still learn from this book, and it will make learning anatomy more fun.  It has lots of great full page drawings too.  I've noticed improvements in my skills, and look forward to going through it again in the future.

1416550518|3.0|The book begins when Dr. Grace Bradley, an elderly lady in a nursing home, suffers a nightmare after receiving a letter from a film producer who is filming a movie about the death of a poet during a party at the great house in which she served as lady's maid to the mistress of the house.  Dr. Bradley is invited to view the movie's sets to advise on the authenticity and she realizes that her time is growing short.  She begins tape recording the true story behind the death for the benefit of her grandson, who is an author of mystery books but has suffered a trauma that has brought about a severe case of writer's block.<br /><br />The book is good, well-written, and well-researched.  I enjoyed reading it.  One thing that I must say is that it very much reminded me of the movie Titanic in the way in which is it set up - an elderly woman remembering a traumatic event in her early life that changes the path along which the rest of her life will follow.  I am reluctant to say that the form was copied from Titanic but that is the reason I am giving it an average score.
B0013FBS20|1.0|&#34;I Am Legend&#34; could have been a very good movie had it followed Richard Matheson's book of the same name. Instead, we are treated with CGI vampire-like creatures that resemble the mummies from Brendan Frasier's &#34;The Mummy&#34; movies. Instead of the thinking creatures from Matheson's book, we have mindless adrenalin-fueled eating machines, much like those in the &#34;28 Days/Weeks Later&#34; movies.<br /><br />Once I realized I wasn't watching a faithful adaptation, I figured I'd let the movie stand on its own and see how it turned out. What it actually reminded me of was &#34;28 Weeks Later.&#34; As a matter of fact, if this been the third movie in that series, it would have fit perfectly; although it would be the weakest link in that series.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the book, you will probably be sorely disappointed with this movie. Had the powers that be behind this film stayed faithful to the original story, they'd have had a really good film on their hands. Instead, we got a typical serving of style over substance.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I teach high school English, and once we finished studying Dante's Inferno, I had my students watch What Dreams May Come.  While it was not created as a representation of Dante's Hell, it does portray a vivid image of one author (the film is based on a novel)/director's vision of what heaven and hell are like. The film lends itself to meaningful discussion of life after death - including the idea of reincarnation.  And, yes, I teach in a public school.  And, no, there is nothing wrong with having this discussion.     Robin Williams (as well as the other actors) do a wonderful job in their roles.
037582913X|3.0|This book was bought for our children because it was a favorite of my wife's childhood.<br /><br />The storyline is simple, suitable for younger children, and has a cute \\"twist\\" at the end that younger children will enjoy.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading (on a regular basis, the more the better!) to your children from very young ages.

B00133KFGW|5.0|Have you ever watched a movie that left you simply speechless and fulfilled? Well, August Rush left me feeling that way! I vaguely remember when this movie was released, and not hearing a thing out it. But when it was released on DVD, I said \\"what the heck, give it a try\\". It was surprisingly, one of the best, well written and well thought out movies that I have read in a long time. I simply loved the story, the acting, the music...everything.     Evan (AKA August Rush) was always sure about two things in life, (1) he heard music in everything, and (2) his parents were looking for him! Starting with vivid imagery and personal narrative, Evan describes how he feels about his life and music, while always feeling different from everyone else. As he begins his personal journey, we see how truly special he is. We soon learn the story behind his birth (one night of passion between two musicians, Louis and Lyla), and how he was eventually put up for adoption, by Lyla's very over protective father, who thinks it is in her best interest. Escaping his group home and \\"following the music\\", Evan has a series of misadventures as others discover his genius. During his journey, Evan never gives up faith that he will find his parents. And while some try to use Evan (the Wizard, played by Robin Williams), some try to help him (Terrance Howard), some try to find him (Lyla), some befriend him (two lovable and equally talented kids) and some discover him (his unbeknowest father, Louis).      Since so many others have reviewed this movie, I won't say too much more except to watch this movie. You will smile, cry and laugh. It will leave you with a feeling of hope!
0385338724|4.0|When Lexi Smart wakes up following an accident, it's to learn that it's three years later and her life is nothing like she remembers it. The last thing Lexi remembers is clubbing with her girlfriends, and falling down some stairs while trying to get a cab home. The girls were drinking away their problems--in particular, that everyone in Lexi's company got a bonus except her, because she was too junior, her loser boyfriend stood her up, and that her father's funeral is the next day. In the hospital, Lexi learns that not only has her father's funeral come and gone, but that she's now a member of the senior management team at her company, she's two sizes smaller and much more sleek and sophisticated, and she's got a husband who is rich, successful, and gorgeous.<br /><br />Thinking she's woken up in a fairy tale, Lexi jumps headfirst into her new life. She moves into her immaculate and pristine loft with her real-estate developer husband and is determined to fit in with her new image as a woman who only dresses in neutral colors, whose ambition and drive are what she is known for, and who bears no resemblance at all to the woman who Lexi remembers. Despite her frustration at her inability to remember, Lexi is determined to persevere. But when her husband's lead architect gives Lexi some more startling information about her past, things begin to turn a little topsy-turvy in Lexi's already confusing life.<br /><br />Remember Me? is classic Sophie Kinsella. Lexi is an fun, flawed, laugh-out-loud heroine as only Kinsella can write them. She's full of self-deprecating charm, witty banter, and quick retorts, despite the fact that half the time she doesn't know what she's talking about. I have to admit that at first the whole waking up three years later with amnesia plot seemed a bit too Alias for me, but it worked out well. It was interesting to navigate the twists and turns of Lexi's life with her as the tried to acclimate herself to the person she'd become. It was also great to read a fun and clever story with such a (partially) unique storyline. Sophie Kinsella fans won't be disappointed with this new offering, and anyone in the mood for a lighthearted and amusing story will appreciate it as well.n and clever story with such a (partially) unique storyline.

B00005JPTK|5.0|In what, in my opinion, has been a lull in good movie releases,  I Am Legend pleasantly surprised me.  A friend and I were bored one Friday night and neither one of us particularly cared for the trailer, but we decided to see it after it got some surprisingly good reviews for an action movie.  Also, I found out it was based on a novel by the great Richard Matheson which is one of the major writers of the Twilight Zone, so that sold me.  Neither one of us expected much of this movie, but both of us came out of it rating it 5 stars and already talking about looking forward to buying it when it came out.    That being said, I was TERRIBLY upset when I saw that the \\"Special Edition\\" had VERY limited features.  A crappy 4 minute alternate ending that I can find on youtube and NOT EVEN A COMMENTARY?  I am so glad I did not buy the special edition.  Hopefully there will be a REAL special edition soon with some decent special features on it, but I would advise against buying this one.  Great movie, no features!

1400063515|4.0|Black Swan is a solid read.  Admittedly, I do not find it as insightful as \\"Fooled by Randomness;\\" however, I would recommend it.  The narrower breadth is likely the reason for my reduced pleasure.      Having said all of that, last week, Bear Stearns was sold to JP Morgan Chase for ~$250M (x-debt).  At the root of the decline of Bear were a bunch of models / bankers that failed to consider fat tails or \\"Black Swans.\\"  Liquidity ceased w/in short term lending market (which were heavily used against long term assets), as banks feared the real value of other banks housing-related assets.  Banks were fearful, given there were correlations within the securitization unlike anything ever experienced historically (\\"prime\\" and ALT A loans, behaving like subprime, etc).   This event only further solidifies the book's teachings, especially while it's (Bear and the read) fresh on the mind.    In summary, if you've read Fooled by Randomness, read it, you'll enjoy.  If not, buy Fooled by Randomness first and see where you stand with the author, his writing style, his personality and his paradigm.  Note: The author's personality and experiences are indeed special.  I look forward to his next read.

I recognized the orlando venue on the tour footage that came on the bonus DVD(I missed that show!!).This version of the album contains an extra disc and a new song.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|In a few years The Mist will be as loved as The Thing is now. And it´s the purest take ever on Stephen King's usual themes. The controversial and very disturbing last scene is a heartbreaking and masterfully executed example of the kind of real dilemmas people has to face in situations like that. Forget about the monsters and think about a war and you'll see it starts to make sense. Horrific and, ultimately, pointless? Maybe, but truly heroic too.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I met the drummer of this band at a comic convention with a friend around the time l picked this album up. It was icing on the cake because I have been a fan since the self-titled record. I dont care if this is a collection of b-sides I treat it as an album. Stand out tracks: Mr.Jack, Ego-brain. Under Toxicity this is their best release yet.
0743455967|5.0|I love Stephen King's scary novels and have read all of them, but this non-fiction book describing how he writes those novels is the best thing he has ever written. Reading \\"On Writing\\" gives you insight into his personality, as he talks about his supportive wife,  and the triumphs and tragedies he has lived through. This insider information makes you appreciate his novels even more. Also if you are an aspiring writer, Mr King gives useful advice on the process of writing and what it's like to get published from his personal experience. Part autobiography, and part \\"how to write\\" book, anyone who loves Stephen King will appreciate him even more after reading this book. Luckily it is now available in paperback for a low price. Buy one for everyone on your list who likes Stephen King, and/or wants to be a writer.  (I am a full time professional non-fiction writer/reporter who loves Stephen King, loved this book, and learned from it)
B000001DQG|4.0|This album is one of my all-time favorites. Being under pressure to put out an album in just over a week, the writing team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin truly accomplished excellence, though only 2 songs reached the top 40 charts. The side musicians on the record are superb, most notably the horn section of Tower of Power, and some awesome back-up vocalists including Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys, Dusty Springfield, and Clydie King. Personally .. I feel that reviewers that were dissappointed because it paled in comparison to the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road were forgetting something. That remarkable album was the exception, not the rule. \\"Pinky\\" .. is (by far) my favorite cut on the Caribou album. Also, the somber ballad \\"Ticking\\" showcases Elton's piano and vocals at their very finest. As far as the CD re-issue .. I really didn't care for the bonus tracks, although \\"Cold Highway\\" isn't too bad. I feel that any EJ fan should add this CD to their music collection.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Heavenly voices in concert...these fantastic women are no beginners for they come to the stage with solid musical backgrounds and beautifully connect with a mesmerized audience.  A wide variety of songs offers something for every listener and looks toward a bright future for this talented crew. Watch out...you'll find yourself humming these tunes often with pleasant surprise.
1400049628|5.0|This was part of my nephew's birthday gift, along with a camping head lamp and an Xbox zombie killing game.  I didn't know he is actually scared of zombies, and he won't play the video game.  Buthe likes this book, and maybe it will help him overcome his fear!    For anyone who is a fan of zombie movies, or who is genuinely convinced that zombies may be threat to our survival, this book should be in your collection.  And you'll need a head lamp to keep both hands free for zombie killing. :-)
0553381687|5.0|Martin has written a sensational series of books combining the struggles and lives of two major families and their destinies.  I am desperately waiting for Martin to publish his concluding volume.  However, each of the books in the series is a stand-alone story.  They just keep you wanting more.  Come on George, start writing.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I thought this was a very moving depiction of the life of the Queen as well as about the family's response to Diana's death.  I came away feeling pity for Elizabeth II in her position although she is far better off in the world than I am.  It portrayed a difference in personal freedoms, and as someone once told me with knowledge comes responsibility.    I have only been aquainted with Mirren's movies in the past two years.  I think she is superb as the Queen, she nailed this one all the way.  She had me convinced she really was the Queen and I must mention Cromwell.   I have been watching this man for a lot of years and he is such a gifted actor.  It is pure pleasure watching him on the screen.  His roles always seem perfectly suited to him.  Excellent.
0307237702|4.0|I thought this book was just you needed if you had any question about where obama stood on anything. It shows you he will stand his ground and his feet are firmly planted, it also shows you he is rather smart compared to some of the other people we have in politics here in the United States.
0307237702|5.0|I have such respect for Obama's intelligence and insight.     In this book, he discusses his priorities and his positions on many issues. What I like most is that he avoids ridiculing other points of view. In fact, he acknowledges the best of their positions, then goes on to explain his own ideas.     For example, Obama is pro-choice. But instead of painting pro-lifers as neanderthals who want to enslave women, he sees that many are principled people who care deeply. That, in turn, gives his decision to value reproductive freedom more weight.    This is the kind of thinker and communicator I'd like to have leading our country.
B00003CXD5|5.0|One of the all time great classic movies.... what can I say that hasn't been already said ?
B00004R9A4|5.0|I loved this movie as a child, and didn't really expect my kids to like it (a lot of talk with just a little animation thrown in) but my 3-year old asks to watch it all the time. Old school Disney when animation was done by artisans, not computers, and adventures that inspired my imagination back then, and my kids imaginations now.

1416914293|5.0|City of Ashes is absolutely wonderful... definitely an excellent follow up to City of Bones.  The only problem is that City of Glass, the final book, doesn't come out for a year!!!  I recommend this book to anyone with a love of reading!
B000O599WG|5.0|This was a huge movie when it came out, it had John Wayne at the hight of his popularity, Dean Martin at the rise of his, Ricky Nelson, america's T.V. teen idol and Walter Brennan who played Grandpa Amos on the highly rated T.V. show, The Real McCoy's.<br /><br />I saw this at the movies three times in one week when I was a kid. I talked my mother into taking me, then the next night my grandparents stoped by and asked if my sister and me wanted to go see it with them ( she didn't, but I jumped on the chance ! )and two days after that , I saw it with my best friend at the matinee!<br /><br />It had John Wayne being John Wayne, a sheriff standing off the bad guys from breaking his prisoner out of his jail. Helped by Dean Martin, the town drunk who used to be a gunslinger, Ricky Nelson, the enigmatic ( actually, just sort of creepy in retrospect ) \\" The Kid \\" and the always entertaining Walter Brennan as his deputy, OH ! and leave us not forget Angie Dickinson, who didn't add much to the plot, but was mighty nice to look at.<br /><br />What a great era, what a great time, what a great movie!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|TSCC might be be my favorite new television show. I enjoyed the Terminator movies, not because of the acting(seriously!), but for the story and the action.   Since we are now on Fox, obviously the action had to be toned down, but the storyline picks up exponentially (for that matter, so does the acting).  In never thought i would be saying these words, but one of the best moments in this show for me is the inclusion of Brian Austin Green.....need a minute after that one.    People complain that this show is nothing the movies....well, yeah. Why do we need more of those? They should have quit after T2 anyway.    It's entertainment folks. That's all. If it's not your brand of vodka, drink something else.    The only thing about this show that pisses me off is the fact that there are only 9 episodes. I'd like to send my \\"gratitude\\" to the individuals involved in the writers strike for that. You people need to sit down, drop the signs, and do your job...it's the job YOU chose after all.
0755314069|3.0|Steve Wozniak is surely one of our great technologists but he is not a great writer (even with the cited co-author/ghost writer who should have done better).  For the most part, this book is not written for the average reader and I suspect even the average Apple devotee might find it tough going.  It probably appeals most to the Apple fan who is also a hardcore geek and wants to dive into the details of how things worked and the pitfalls along the way.  Although there is an effort to explain some of the jargon to include a good glossary at the back (but strangely no index?), much of the book is rather tedious and in the weeds.  Aside from the writing (which is conversational and generally about Middle School level), this book could have been much improved by a tough editor.  All that said, if the average reader (who is neither an Apple fan or detractor but is interested in the development of the computer industry) can persevere, there are some interesting anecdotes that make the book worthwhile.
B000KN7BIQ|5.0|Forget about the aspect ratio, focus on the film and it's plot...The story is superb, the acting is first class, the customs and the beautiful music is unique!!!! The HD version is great with no \\"snowy\\" images when is shot in the dark (like Blu-ray).. I love this movie. If you are a true movie lover without prejudices, you will love it!!
B00102F5WK|4.0|This movie was out of this world--out of our world, that is.  If you want to see what some of these more-violent Middle Eastern cultures are, here you go.  It doesn't seem believable that other cultures could be like that, but that's how they really are.  This is the first movie I've ever seen that depicts it the way it really is.    Keep in mind that this movie gets as far left as it can with all of the usual far left perceptions.  They show torture in it and all of that stuff.  Everyone sane realizes that the US doesn't torture people and that only 3 of all of the terrorists have been water-boarded, but that's how the movie perceives it.  Also, they never show what the result was of the guy they catch.  They never show him being guilty or innocent, which is a real cliffhanger at the end of the movie.    So, if you want to know about extreme, Middle Eastern culture and like movies where all of the characters are intertwined, I definitely recommend it.  Like I said, the plot runs a little left, but it's still a very watchable movie.  Because of the far-left agenda, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.
B00007KWI9|4.0|I somehow bypassed this CD until now. What a well crafted album it is. Every song is great and the bonus tracks are just as good.<br /><br />Don't miss this early version of Yes, you won't be disappointed.
0743298039|5.0|What a fabulous read!!!! This tale kept my interest and never dragged. I loved the whole gothic mysterious feel of this book. Can't say enough good things about it!!!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Yes, this is as good as OK Computer.<br /><br />Brilliant, well crafted CD that deserves to be included in the top 100 albums of the decade.<br /><br />The bonus CD should have been added to the main CD and make it 1 CD.<br /><br />Hope there is a LIVE DVD of these songs one day.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Unfortunately, the new Sarah (Lena Headey) pales in comparison to the old Sarah (Linda Hamilton).  Headey is stiff, \\"all business,\\" and almost as robotic as the machines she is fighting.  Fortunately though, other aspects of this show are so strong that it gets a huge enthusiastic thumbs-up from me.  The action and special effects are great, the science fiction elements are new and interesting, and the drama is excellent.  Acting is solid, and the teenage John Connor character is well-cast.  The Terminator protector fembot, Summer Glau, has the most memorable scenes though, and is the real star of the show.  She has far more shades and nuances than the Arnold bodyguard in T2, and manages to be both likable and creepy at the same time.  I also enjoyed Brian Austin Green as John's uncle from the future; he plays a gritty character similar to Reese (John's father) in the first Terminator, but wiser and more ruthless.  Finally, the evil terminators are played icy cold, and are a joy to watch.  In sum, the Season 1 episodes were great -- well-directed, written, and acted -- and are all highly replayable.
B000ZN8036|5.0|Christopher McCandless, a recent Emory graduate and the son of wealthy parents, decides to give up his money, his identity, and his family and live on his own.  He travels across the country, and eludes the best efforts of his parents to locate him.  His sister, lonely without her best support in the family, narrates her feelings about him throughout the movie.  Chris considers his parents to be hypocritical liars and his journey is partly motivated by anger towards them and partly by his own adventuresome spirit.  Along the way he comes across kindly people who give him a job, a place to stay, or a listening ear.  One of those he comes across is an old man, played wonderfully by Hal Holbrook, who has given up on life and relationships.    Chris's ultimate objective is to live in the wild in Alaska, and much of the film is devoted to his time there.  The scenery is beautiful, but the struggle is brutal.  This movie has many layers and will springboard many discussions among those who have see it.

B00122OTQ6|4.0|When it came to innovation, Genesis had a lot to prove back in the 80's. After being clipped from a foursome into a trio with the departure of Steve Hackett on their 1978 album, And Then There Were Three, the trio of Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had to really prove that they were just more than met the eye. Not only was that possible to die hard Genesis fans, but also with a new decade that started to get hooked on MTV. Well, the group had to show that well, bringing innovation and personal experiences on what was in not just the music, but for Phil a showcase of songs that would step up the writings he would've made for years to come.<br /><br />The 2007 re-release of Duke, the classic Genesis album has been remastered and restored to Dolby Digital sound, and brings in the classic sounds and songs from the #1 U.K. album, to a new generation of fans. The songs all sound better than ever, but continue to bring the haunting feeling of deep thought. The album contains the classics Misunderstanding, the classic Turn It On Again, the deep and haunting storytelling of Dutchess and the innovaive Behind The Lines. The songs not just bring a striking feeling of the Genesis sound, but also through Phil Collins personal life as well, with him undergoing his first difficult divorce, as was shown in great songs like the somber and moody Please Don't Ask. Every song sounds great, and is a good innovation that still stands out today.<br /><br />All in all, Duke is really a must buy for die hard Genesis fans, and now that it has been restored in 5.1 surround sound, it definitely feels more like a revolution than meets the eye. If you've loved Invisble Touch or are a huge Phil Collins fan, than you'll drool from beginning to end with each note on this album, and that is nothing to sneeze at behind the lines.<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B00138H94S|5.0|\\"Sandanista\\" and \\"London Calling\\" are the two essential Clash CDs.  There is a lot of good music here.  And say, is that Ellen Foley singing on \\"Hitsville hit UK?\\" It must be.  There's probably a trivia site somewhere or its buried in the liner notes, that you don't get when you download the music.  I'm new to downloading stuff.  CD jewel cases with their nice straight edges made great surfaces to grind up that fine white powder.  Now I have to smash it with a spoon.  The trade off is you save a couple bucks.  And if you want to find out who the personnel on the CD are, GO LOOK IT UP ON THE WEB, you dinosaur.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is brilliant.  His teachings on consciousness are very valuable and have many practical applications.  I very strongly recommend this book to adults of all ages who are interested in personal growth.  Margaret Warren
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|I really like this music, and if you like Amy, you gotta like this one. Highly recommended for Amy fans. If you haven't heard her, give her a try--she's a very talented artist. A little crazy, maybe, but aren't we all?
1401307450|3.0|I found the pages whizzing by, found the insight into rock stardom and addiction fascinating. But I wanted to brain the singer with a two-by-four when for the umpteenth time, sure enough, he's back on the drugs. You have rock-stardom, the world your oyster, and what do you do with it? Why not blast yourself away with some crack.    You must give points for honesty, but the singer sounds like a bit of a sociopath, a morally bankrupt human being whose music I can appreciate, though the man himself would not be welcome in my house. I am not surprised Hillel's relatives blame Keidis for Hillel's death, incidentally, and am less surprised by Keidis describing their blame as \\"disgusting\\". Kiedis sounds like he still has a couple of decades growing up to do, and if I'm expected to believe he's stayed clean of drug use, pull the other one.    In short, good entertainment, but maybe for bad reasons, and there's little profundity or insight to be found in this book.
0440237688|5.0|Put simply, this is a fantastic book. Following the character of Jonas, Lois Lowry tells the story of a world in which difference has been obliterated, rudeness is obliterated, and everything is controlled. However, beneath this Stepford-like perfection lies the truth--in order for this utopia to continue, lies must be told and atrocities must take place behind closed doors, in the dark and silence. At the start of the book the reader has only a vague (though persistent) feeling of creepiness, though as the story continues this escalates into full revulsion. As I was reading, I could not help but be reminded of Ayn Rand's book, \\"Anthem\\" (those who enjoyed the Giver might find that they enjoy this book as well, and for similar reasons). This book reminds us of the importance of pain and joy, and reminds us that even though life might sometimes hurt, the goods are worth fighting for. From a philosophical standpoint, this book is beyond fantastic in its implications and the issues it raises--a must read. Brilliant.
B0010ZR160|3.0|Ben Affleck tackles the dark, clannish underbelly of Boston again, this time behind the lens. As in \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" he deftly recreates the hardscrabble fight for survival of the working class in South Boston. His subjects struggle to pay the rent and keep their kids out of the trouble that lurks on every corner and in every seedy bar.    Affleck elicits the most powerful performance from Amy Ryan as Helene, the drugged out mother whose daughter, Amanda, is missing. Her Boston accent is dead on, and she manages to evoke a tight-lipped sorrow, despite absorption in her own miserable existence.    Disgusted by the mother's seeming lack of concern, the child's aunt and uncle tap private investigators Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie (Michelle Monaghan)to ply the locals for information. The younger Affleck is convincing as a townie who has channeled the grim world he grew up in into a mental toughness and moral center. Despite his baby face and wiry frame, he quickly shows that he is more than up to the challenge of handling dangerous barflys and murderous drug dealers.    Kenzie's and Angie's quest leads them to spar with some of the most despicable characters you'll see on screen this year. Just as the web of Amanda's disappearance is untangling, the couple suddenly find themselves at a dead end.    The film seems to be headed toward a premature finale when the determined Kenzie pieces together the bits and pieces that have been gnawing at his detective's instincts. His diligence pays off, and he unravels a plot that points not at the shady characters he's been targeting, but at some of the people at the center of the investigation.    This is where the film both reveals its most damaging flaw and makes its greatest impact. The truth poses grave threats to Kenzie's relationship with Angie -- and his life. As in \\"Mystic River,\\" the other major film adapated from a Dennis Lehane novel, the central plot twist is implausible. I hadn't felt so duped since M. Night Shamaylan's \\"The Village.\\"    While this plot development is clumsy, it sets up a moral dilemma that sends shock waves through the consciousness of all the central characters. I won't reveal what happens. But how Affleck resolves the conflict will leave you with just as many questions as answers (in a good way).    If the unraveling of the crime is unbelievable, the final scene is unforgettable. Very strong performances and an untidy but gripping ending save this film -- but just barely.

B00005JLPK|4.0|It is a great story but beyond that it is  beautifully filmed cinema & some of Hayek's best work to date.   As portrayed, Frida was quite a woman. She was severely injured early in  life leaving her with lifelong disabilities. The bus accident was recreated in horrific detail. An excellently produced scene.  A gifted artist, she was mentored by by Diego Rivera, well done by Alfred Molina. He was perhaps Mexico's most celebrated artist & leader of the Communist party as was Frida in the 30's. He was a serial cheat & knowing this Frida became his third wife. Frida: \\"Will you always be faithful?\\" Diego: \\"I will always be loyal.\\"  To his chagrin, she become good friends with his second wife. She was a better artist than he but not nearly as well known. He received a commission from Rockefeller. She sublimated everything for her husband's career & traveled with him to the US, probably to keep an eye on him. He could have been internationally famous but would not soften his communism, & lost his commission. She also traveled to France. The movie claims she had an affair with Leon Trosky. He was a guest in her home on the run from Stalin. After he left the security of her home he was assassinated. She had always desired her own show but that did not happen until she was bed-ridden & near death.  There is a lengthy interview extra on the dvd with Salma Hayek. She is beautiful & seems very nice. There is a great bit of detail on the making of the movie, her decision on the director & the life of Frida.
B0011Z3DAC|1.0|... because it isn't funny. I haven't bought the album yet, but I don't intend to based on the Amazon clips. I want my hard and heavy rockers back, not these EMO imposters.     There are only 2 songs worth having on this album, in my opinion. What I've Done is such a teaser as the only identifiably Linkin Park song on the disk. It makes me want to go dig out Hybrid Theory and Meteora and reminisce. The other song worth having is Shadow Of The Day. I heard this song on the radio and loved it, even though at the time I had no clue it was LP. Needless to say, I was shocked when I realized that's who it was because it's completely EMO and not at all what I expected.
0312263511|5.0|I liked this book for its coverage of all the space flights from the beginning with Gemini to the end with Apollo. Gene was in fact the \\"last man on the moon\\" as we stopped going to the moon after his flight! He did more in his lifetime than most anyone. He started as a Navy pilot, about to go into Vietnam, when he got pulled for astronaut duty. I liked reading his descriptions of the celebrity lifestyle the original astronauts lived, with lots of parties at the Cape in Florida (while the wives were banished to their homes outside Houston!). I thought he touched on what it was like for the wives to live with a larger-than-life \\"space hero\\" in their midst, but he pulled back in some places. He does give his opinion on all the famous astronauts like Al Shephard and Neil Armstrong, and what he thought of their personalities and also their ranking as far as the best of the astronauts. The only downside to the book was, because Gene was involved in so many space flights, both as a backup crew and regular crew, that by the time you get to his last moon flight it's a bit routine hearing once again about getting the rocket ready for launch, stuffing themselves into their bulky spacesuits, etc. Overall, the book is very thorough and good but maybe could have used more humorous stories. I also liked the very beginning of the book where he talks about his grandparents old-time farm in Antigo, WI, without any running water or electricity.
B00004R9A4|5.0|To begin with, you can think of Bedknobs and Broomsticks as Mary Poppins meets Harry Potter meets Nemo meets Narnia who via the Lion King who will remind you of Tigger because tiggers really are wonderful things.  Although this movie seems to borrow from all the aforementioned, it was actually made in 1971 and has since become a Disney classic acceptable for all ages. It is Directed by Robert Stevenson and stars Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson, and Roddy McDowall who plays a catholic priest.  The interaction between Lansbury and Roddy is fascinating in that subtly explores the complex relationship between religious and humanistic philosophies.<br /><br />This wonderful musical will keep your children engaged especially the creative special effects and scenes featuring the animals from the Island of Naboo.  I really enjoyed how the ghost army, no doubt borrowed from Tolkien's lord of the rings, overcomes the Nazis without shedding one single drop of blood.<br /><br />The movie begins innocently enough with  a woman played by Lansbury who is secretly studying for her correspondence degree in magic.  However, her plans are complicated when by royal edict she is forced to house three children who have been left homeless by the war. When her final magic lesson is suddenly canceled, Lansbury-with children in tow- sets out on a journey with the aid of a magical bed to solve the riddle plaguing her life and keeping her from accomplishing her self-assigned top secret mission.<br /><br />The movie is responsible for bring notoriety to the phrase TREGUNA MEKOIDES TRECORUM SATIS DEE making it since one of the most famous spells in the world.  Parents can rest assured that Disney was careful not to include real magical spells in the movie especially those kinds that raise the dead.  The gibberish spells used in the film are harmless and Parents need not worry about the children using them to transform people into bunny rabbits or conjure grandpa up from the local cemetery. However, to take the mystery out this whole ordeal, I have prepared a translation.<br /><br />The first word TREGUNA is actually two words,  TRE and GUNA.  TRE is a prefix, which can combine with the letter S to create the number 3. The suffix GUNA translates (you) GO! The \\"you\\" is implied. The prefix \\"ME\\" in MEKOIDES--translated as an accusative as opposed to an ablative--can be understood in a context such as \\"the old black magic has ME in its spell.\\" As an ablative \\"ME\\" would translate - \\"me / you'll do fine with ME, baby.\\" The suffix KOIDES can translate \\"you will see\\" or \\"you will be seeing.\\" The third word TRECORUM returns us back to the prefix \\"TRE\\" which as we spoke can combine with \\"S\\" to mean three, which for the purposes of our translation here would make sense since the numbers three and thirteen have a long magical history.  We come now to the suffix in the word CORUM ,which when spelled correctly gives us<br />\\"QUORUM\\" :In the neutral-plural-genitive, the word QUORUM neatly translates into the phrase \\"the army, half OF WHICH there were not a few\\"  meaning a significant force.  SATIS translates \\"enough,\\" \\" sufficient / sufficiently.\\" DEE is somewhat problematic. In Latin DE is a preposition meaning \\"down from,\\" \\"from,\\"  \\"concerning,\\" \\"about.\\"  As a preposition, it connects a noun to another element in a sentence. However, DE may also be understood as an ablative-the Latin case of adverbial relation, which implies the notion \\"away from,\\"  the source or place of an action.<br /><br />Now if we combine these meanings creatively we have a gibberish spell that makes sense for the movie.  TREGUNA: \\"Three armies arise! You go!\\" MEKOIDES: \\"And be at rest for you will do fine with ME for that old black magic has ME it is spell. And once again you will see! Yes you will be seeing with mortal eyes once more.\\" TRECORUM: \\"Oh Three great armies,  half of which where no so few\\" SATIS: \\" yet sufficient enough, I summon you\\". DE: \\"concerning war.\\"<br /><br />The phrase is innocent enough and without the magic of adventure, our lives would be boring dull propositions and our imaginations null of the creative forces that gave us the legends we still embrace to this day. However, a warning to cat-lovers.  This movie adds a huge exclamation point to the stereotypical black cat.  I have never in my life seen a mangier domesticated cat than I did in this film.  I asked my cat Fanny, what she thought, she said, \\"Cats are clean animals ...even magical black cats.\\"f adventure, our lives would be boring dull propositions and our imaginations null of the creative forces that gave us the legends we still embrace to this day.

0452289963|1.0|Gave this book one star because the ideas were so outrageous as to be entertaining.<br /><br />Mr. Tolle seems not to have taken into consideration the concept of synergy which is, 'the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects' (New Oxford Dictionary of English).<br /><br />In laymans terms this means the whole is less than the sum of its parts.<br />We may seem crazy, as a whole Earth, yet when you give each piece of this Earth the individual attention and inspection it deserves, the beauty Mr. Tolle has missed is actually quite apparent.<br /><br />It has lessened my personal opinion of Oprah and her book club to see this book as a selection. This is no more than the ravings of an egomaniac who seems to believe he \\"holds the key to ending all suffering in the world\\". Please.

This does not mean anything he has to say will create an awakening in the reader. This is why he puts the following clause in the introduction to the book: \\"Some are not ready for the awakening\\" (or something to that affect). What he really means to say is \\"some are too intelligent to be fooled by this silly ruse. Some are too able to think for themselves.\\"<br /><br />What kind of egomaniac must this man be? He presumes to know all that Jesus, Buddha and other \\"greats\\" knew. A piece of advice: those greats who knew so much did not broadcast that. Any person who claims he is \\"enlightened\\" and sings it from the rooftops knows very little. Please do not be fooled by this circus act.

B0013FBS20|2.0|Let me start this by saying that I am a fan of Will Smith.  I have watched everything from \\"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air\\" to \\"Men in Black\\".  I think that he is a very clever actor and usually picks his movies with care.  Sadly though, this was not one of those films.  The flash backs became annoying, the acting was rather ho-hum..and WHY did they have to kill the dog?  That dog was the only \\"heart\\" to this film.   I love ya, but next time....don't waste your bullets and don't get caught in your own trap.

B000UVLK1M|4.0|Herbie Hancock's Joni Mitchell tribute is very good, and it's nice Herbie received the extra recognition of the Grammy.  I don't think it's the best jazz CD of 2007, but I'm not a voter anyway.  The key element in Herbie's band is Wayne Shorter.  He plays a big role, and his sensibilities shape the sounds of each song.  Dave Holland's bass is excellent, and the drums and guitar don't stand out much.  The vocal songs are sung by a variety of fine singers.  None of them jazz the song up too much.  Tina Turner may not be recognized as a jazz singer, but she sounds very good.  My favorite has to be Corinne Rae Bailey, simply for the sound of her voice.  Even though there's no scatting, it's certainly a jazz CD, and Herbie and Wayne make sure of that.  They play unobvious notes throughout, and make them go down easy enough.  The instrumentals are laid back, but it's deep.  \\"Nefertiti\\" is an instrumental highlight.  The last song with Leonard Cohen's narration is just kind of strange.

0307237702|4.0|I decided to read this book when I realized that Barack Obama is probably going to be the next President of the United States. Although I do not agree with much of his policy, I thought it would be wise to get to know the person who will likely be leading our country for the next four years.<br /><br />As a piece of literature, this book leave much to be desired. Many of his contentions are agreeable enough: the need for civil discourse in contemporary politics, a disdain for the sound-byte driven news media, a desire to portray issues in terms other than \\"us vs. them\\", the argument that our society is \\"a conversation to be had\\" rather than \\"a house to be built\\", etc.<br /><br />Eventually, though, I became bored since I found myself reading the same argument over and over again despite the supposed change of subject as I progressed through the chapters. I thought to myself, \\"Okay, I agree with your thesis. Let's move on to a more detailed discussion of these problems,\\" but a more detailed discussion never occurred. Instead he cataloged his personal experiences with topics of which most folks interested in politics are well aware.<br /><br />That being said, what he successfully conveys is his genuine desire to accomplish substantive change in the political process and culture in America. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that his knowledge and understanding of American history clearly goes beyond rhetorical quotations of popular figures, and into the core of the issues that have been debated in this nation throughout its existence.<br /><br />The logic I developed to justify supporting Obama when it became clear that the choice for President was going to be between he an McCain is this: I would rather have my country competently lead by someone who stands for what he believes in, possessing beliefs founded upon his understanding of the issues and guided by his personal values, rather than lead, competency notwithstanding, by someone whose stance shifts as they pander to different demographics in an attempt to grab votes and financial support, this in spite of the fact that at this moment their rhetoric may more closely match my idealogical leanings. This book confirms the validity of that reasoning and has convinced me to support Obama in November.cs in an attempt to grab votes and financial support, this in spite of the fact that at this moment their rhetoric may more closely match my idealogical leanings.

B00005B58Y|4.0|\\"Milestones\\" was released on Columbia Records in 1958, Miles was starting to find his sound in modal jazz. The title track is a perfect example of Miles approach to composition: simple melodies, complex improvisations. This compositional approach would carry on with him through the rest of the 50s to mid-60s.<br /><br />I thought this album overall compared to some of his earlier recordings was considerably weaker. I don't think that John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley particularly blended well together on this session. The piano of Red Garland was outstanding as usual, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones are solid.<br /><br />The overall song selection was very weak for Miles. Many of the tunes don't really go anywhere and the improvisations aren't particularly cohesive. Again, the title track is the best tune on the record.<br /><br />Miles would go on to do great things after \\"Milestones.\\" In my opinion, I thought that \\"Seven Steps To Heaven\\" was Miles' best record. Many people didn't like that it, but I think the compositions were alot better, three of them being, the title track, \\"So Near, So Far,\\" and \\"Joshua.\\"<br /><br />\\"Milestones\\" isn't a record I go back and listen to very much, but does have some very memorable moments. Definitely worth acquiring if you're a fan of Miles or jazz in general.

B000003337|5.0|I've always admired Randy Rhoads playing ability, but never actually heard the earlier Quiet Riot material, because it wasn't released in the US.  I finally managed to track down cd quality bootlegs of QR1 and QR2 and can compare them to this album.  Like some of the other reviews here have already stated, there are songs on here newer than QR 1 & 2, which is very cool.  They were of the caliber that had they been released at the time, they probably would have a minor hit.  I especially enjoyed the original version of Slick Black Cadillac.  I happen to like it better than the version which appeared on the Metal Health album, which recorded by different musicians alltogether.  In comparing this album to the actual earlier recordings, I like this one better, because the sound is dramatically improved.  The older albums weren't mixed very well, and the bass is very muddy sounding.  The drummer was also not particularly good.  I'm a drummer, so maybe I'm a little critical, but the drummer overplays is erratic and plays inconsistently.  I get the impression he didn't ever play the song the same way twice, which for a drummer is a bad habit.<br /><br />The vocals were rerecorded sometimes with completely different lyrics.  This point has been controversial, but honestly in my opinion this is a good thing because some of the lyrics in the originals, were absolutely terrible.  Wholesale changes were made to a couple of songs, but again, the newer versions sound much better.  They even changed some of the choruses and moved the refrain parts around.  Again, it made the songs much better because the originals weren't that great.  So in this respect, I'm glad they did take liberties with the vocals.<br /><br />For me the most pleasant surprise was hearing Randy apparently channeling Glen Buxton.  I had read once that Randy Rhoads was a huge Alice Cooper fanatic, which is cool because I am also a fanatic of that band.  I can really hear the influences of Glen Buxton and Michael Bruce, the guitarists of that legendary band.  The song \\"Look in any Window\\" is so heavily influenced by very early Cooper Albums like \\"Pretties for you\\" or even \\"Freak Out Song,\\" which I point out was sadly taken out of print for many years.  The entire guitar sound both rythym and lead, sound like early Cooper.  I love it!  There is \\"Alice Cooper\\" sprinkled in virtually every song he ever recorded, so it was especially cool to see how this was such a huge part of his overall style so early on.<br /><br />My last comment is those who make harsh assessments of this album.  These guys were 17 to 19 years old when they were recorded.  Except for Randy, they all were just learning their instruments and begining to develop writing styles.  Randy was going to be a star no matter what, but I feel that had they had better lyrics, they could have been huge.guitarists of that legendary band.

032147404X|2.0|I'm not big on trashing an author or CD or a book but I'll have to say that I have to agree with some of the people who shared their reviews about this book: author is slightly irritating in the way he writes (lame jokes throw you off - they don't belong in the book). Book offers some of the tips that I personally found helpful but not to the point of what I expected. There are more tips on what weather to shoot in (cloudy, sunny) and what angle to choose better when shooting flowers than how to do so practically, which is what I personally was looking for. Nevertheless, i did find some of the tips helpful (you learn something new everyday). To sum it up I thought book was a bit overpriced for the information you get.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Eastern Promises is Part 2 of David Cronenberg's excellent collaboration with Viggo Mortensen (see also [[ASIN:B000E1126G A History of Violence]]).  Here, Cronenberg and Viggo take on \\"Londongrad,\\" immersing themselves in the Russian mafia courtesy of screenwriter Steven Knight.  Knight's outstanding work on [[ASIN:B00018D3LE Dirty Pretty Things]] shows that when it comes to London's seamy underbelly, this writer knows his stuff.<br /><br />What to say?  Mortensen is superb here (I'll let others weigh in on how successfully he pulls off the Russian thing), as is Naomi Watts.  [Those of use who saw [[ASIN:B0001CNRRU 21 Grams]] know that Ms. Watts is without peer as an actress.]<br /><br />The big thing here though, for me, is Vincent Cassel.

His is the standout performance in 'Promises.'

B000YRY8BG|5.0|This riveting mini-series from the BBC is television drama of the highest order.  We watched it over a period of six weeks on PBS.  On the seventh Sunday, we were bereft.  Its brilliance is undeniable.<br /><br />The cast is incredible - John Simm (Life on Mars), David Morrissey (later to attempt self-immolation of his career in [[ASIN:B000FS9UKI Basic Instinct 2 (Unrated, Extended Cut)]]), Bill Nighy ([[ASIN:0767833988 Still Crazy]] and countless other classic, untouchable pieces of droll excellence), Polly Walker ([[ASIN:B000FJH4X2 Rome - The Complete First Season]]) and Kelly Macdonald ([[ASIN:B00118T63C No Country for Old Men]])...oh yeah, and a smaller role by one James McAvoy, since gone very large in little things like, oh, [[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement (Widescreen Edition)]].  He gets pumped up here with middle of the cover box treatment, but his role is smaller.<br /><br />The excellence of the production hangs on the intersection of journalist Cal McCaffrey, as portrayed by Simm, and MP Stephen Collins, as portrayed here by Morrissey.  To complicate issues between the two, Collins' winning campaign for MP was managed by McCaffrey, and there's the not small matter of Cal's less-than-subtle pining for Collins' wife (Walker).<br /><br />Over 500 IMDB reviewers have weighed in with an average review of 8.8 (on a 10 scale), pretty much a chart-blower by that discriminating audience  (The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption are 9.1).

KWS really played tribute to these men and the blues.  Thanks KWS.

I haven't felt so strongly about the Foo Fighters since their first album, apart for a song here and there. Great buy!
B000TGJ80S|2.0|Francis Ford Coppola can make good movies. This, unfortunately isn't one of them. It's got some things about it that are amazing, some things I love, but it's also got lot's of unintended comedy and jarring, goofy moments that make you cringe- not with fear, but with disbelief.    First I'll fire off some things I like about it. It's got great music, for starters, that definetly fits the tone of a more serious Dracula movie. Most of the sets are outstanding, and some of the actors do really great jobs. As far as the narrative goes, they stick closer to the novel as any Dracula movie has yet.    The film starts off very promising, with eerie narration and a little background on Dracula, which for me was one of the most striking scenes. Unfortunately, we soon move to a terribly miscast Keanu Reeves narrating in an unconvincing British accent. And then we see the aged Dracula...with a red Halloween-costume satin robe on and white beehive hairdo. At this point I was giggling and going umm...What;s going on with that?    Some problems occur when you update this story and try to add elements from Anne Rice and 80's slasher movies. Dracula and all things vampiric become overtly sexual- something that was more hinted at for sharper  readers of the novel- and Dracula turns from monster to Romantic Anti-hero. Mina Harker basically becomes the 'final girl' in this story- the lone heroine who survives and kills the stalker. It might have worked if the acting had been less cheesy, the nudity less gratuitous, and less bloody ( you may say \\"it's a vampire movie, it's supposed to have blood\\"...you can have too much.).     Of particular mention is Sadie Frost, who, as Lucy, spends roughly 80% of her screen time moaning, topless, or some combination of the two. It's one of those things that you'll be watching, trying to stay serious and you're like...Huh...huhuh...Hey Beavis, check it out.     Also, Tom Waits as Renfield. No thank you. I'll gladly listen to your music. Just stop eating flies.    And some of Dracula's transformations are ridiculous to look at...Think Sci-Fi Channel original movie quality.    Finally, my biggest problem with the movie is that Gary Oldman just doesn't make a very iconic Dracula. I mean with Christopher Lee and Bela Lugosi, both actors had long reaching influence in defining our perceptions of what Dracula is. Gary Oldman, though a great actor ( and getting great roles, lately), doesn't really dominate like his predecessors did. He's just there. He's doesn't steal scenes, which, as Dracula, is his right. Also, I hate his sunglasses and Top Hat. Dracula is supposed to be menacing, not a member of Guns & Roses.

0757302661|4.0|This is a good start towards learning hypnosis birthing but it isn't enough.  As other posters have stated there are many parts in the book that say you will receive certain information in your class.  However, I did not take the class and therefore I feel like I was missing out on very important information.  If you are just thinking about hypnosis and want a basic overview of what it is all about then this is a great beginning.  It will let you know if this is really the path you want to go down.  However, if you really do feel hypnosis for birthing is right for you I would strongly recommend getting the hypnobabies home course.  You will learn so much more and actually feel confident about your hypnosis abilities.

0689835604|5.0|Oh, how my baby loves this book! She squeals with delight as soon as I pick it up because she knows what's coming. I read Katz's Counting Kisses to her every night and we also have Daddy Hugs. The illustrations in those two are also engaging. But nothing delights her as much as the lift the flap aspect of this book.     It's especially intriguing how she \\"reads\\" the last lift a flap. I point out the bear, ball, and wagon and I say \\"but where's baby, where could he be?\\" Then I lift the flap to reveal the baby, my daughter squeals, claps and smiles big and then thoughtfully looks back over at the bear, ball and wagon and then back at the revealed baby. It's like she knows the entire scene has changed by the revealing of the baby. How can a parent not love a book that elicits such engaged thoughtful behavior?     I'd recommend it highly for babies from the peekaboo stage to the learning body parts stage.

It starts out light but gets very heavy, and I suspect many won't be able to finish it, or will skip a few chapters near the end (I ploughed through but didn't necessarily understand all). The paperback has a nice addendum at the start that responds to some criticisms of the book and it is one of the best parts.

I rate this as one of the best books I've ever read, and I look forward to re-reading it.
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|I have viewed a number of Oliver Stones' films.  World Trade Center ranks right up there with Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July.  My senses were jolted when this picture received no nominations for oscars, I felt that this picture was oscar worthy.  Hollywood politics played a hand in shunning this very moving film.          The events of 9 - 11 unfold before your eyes, as New Yorkers and subway riders go to work that day.  Director Stone shows the confusion and chaos of that fateful morning.  This is a family drama tied around a tragic event.  Two families awate the fate of their husbands/fathers, police officers trapped in the building rubble of the collapsed towers.        World Trade Center is based upon true events, the story of two survivors waiting for rescue.  It is a miracle that anyone survived beneath the epicenter of the 9 - 11 blasts.  This is a salute to the rescue teams involved in searching ground zero for trapped survivors.  Oliver Stone reminds us about those dedicated persons in uniform who were trying to make a difference on that fateful day.

For fans of Nick Drake, Elliott Smith, and any other folk-rock act, this soundtrack will remain in your regular rotation indefinitely. The opening track, \\"Falling Slowly,\\" is such a haunting duet that it opens up the rest of the soundtrack so well. I don't think I've liked a soundtrack like this in a longtime (the last one was Jack Johnson's soundtrack to Curious George which continues to bring smiles to my face). When I listen to this soundtrack I cannot help but picture street buskers yearning to touch one another. Buy this, you will not be disappointed.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, this film is not much of an innovation to the genre of cops-and-mobsters flicks.  However, it really doesn't do anything wrong as a film, and does perform a wonderful public service in showing the reality and depth of corruption and collusion between drug lords and the \\"system\\" (=local law enforcement, court/prison system, politicians, business, etc.).  That by itself is a wonderful relief from the usual \\"good guys vs. bad guys\\" simplistic dualism that the media usually bombards us with when covering the so-called \\"war on drugs.\\"  So there is a refreshingly down to earth, let's-be-real-folks sensibility here, not some puerile moral soapbox. The fact that it's based on a true story, despite the inevitable poetic Hollywood embellishments, only makes it that much more powerful.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has not made a truly bad movie in ages, and here he picks the two best leads out there to carry the film, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, both of whom effortlessly command the viewer's attention in every scene they're in.  The narrative unfolds slowly at first but then quickly gears into a brisk pace (not as brisk as a Scorsese film, but plenty brisk) and together with Scott's trademark mastery of visual framing, made the 2.5 hours' runtime really fly by.  There is actually not that much graphic violence for a movie of this genre, so don't expect a \\"Scarface\\" or \\"New Jack City.\\"<br /><br />There is, God bless, a fair amount of very very yummy eye candy for male viewers (whom I'd imagine are the main audience for this type of movie) through Crowe's luscious ex-wife and especially his SMOKIN' HOT lawyer whom he's boinking on the side, oodles of gorgeous black women especially the ones working in Washington's heroin lab who are not allowed to wear clothes for fear they'd steal the goods, and of course Washington's Puerto Rican wife.  No explicit sex scenes, just plenty of artful nudity by some exquisitely-chosen actresses.<br /><br />The \\"uncut extended version\\" of this movie doesn't feel so bloated like many \\"extended versions\\" do, plus it has an extended ending that I found pretty cool.ed version\\" of this movie doesn't feel so bloated like many \\"extended versions\\" do, plus it has an extended ending that I found pretty cool.

B00111L0MY|4.0|Gone baby Gone is an overlooked but otherwise excellent debut for our young talented actor Ben Affleck. What would appear to be a conventional detective drama, at first, quickly turns into a study of morality, decsions and corruption in authority.     It has a three pronged story that starts with the search for a little girl that becomes abducted. After the initial investigation is concluded an interesting plot twist develops with our private investigator (Patrick Kenzie) and the police. An instance of confession on the part of an officer leads to a lingering suspicion of foul play. Further digging for the truth finally uncovers the ultimate truth. Our protagonist, played by Casey Affleck, is then left with a moral decision to make. The story unravels unsuspectingly and the surprises are far from predictable.     It may first appear that Gone Baby Gone is your average run-of-the-mill detective story but it is actually a well written, thrilling and suspensful drama with a considerable amount of intrigue and plot. Casey Affleck's character is a thrill to watch. His very cool exterior but unpredicatble and even explosive nature makes him a very compelling character on screen. Amy Ryan as the cavalier drug mule mother is also a thrill to watch. Anna Hathaway plays a nice supporting role as Affleck's other half but Affleck shines above all with his most brilliant perfromance.    Gone Baby Gone is the sleeper of 2008. It's a pleasant surprise and an exceptionally great debut for an otherwise great actor. Kudos.

On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed.  This preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations I call Natural Selection\\" p. 130, The Origin of Species.    \\"Many Christians perceive evolutionary science itself as essentially an enemy of the faith, and so expend considerable energy attempting to deny its explanatory power...\\" states F. LeRon Shults in his brilliant book Reforming Theological Anthropology (p. 207).  I've owned The Origin of Species for nearly 10 years now but never actually read it: or hardly cracked it open.  I did spend a lot of time trying to DISprove what I had not read though - which really got me nowhere.  I'll be preaching on ideas of creation and evolution at our church in Brooklyn, and decided that instead of just giving second-hand quotes from the book without reading it, why not read it?  I'm glad that I did.    Darwin's most well-known book was really virtually nothing like I had expected that it would be, and I found that I really enjoyed it: and for the most part thought that he made excellent points.  At no point did I ever see him trying to disprove God in any way - he simply spoke against \\"the common idea of creation\\" (pp. 66-67, 113, 171, 223, 379, 382, 384, 392, 415-417, 458, et. al) which he seemed to take as meaning `all things were created as they are today with no room for mutability' or something along those lines.  In fact at several points he even seemed concerned that we not mock God/the Creator.  On page 201 Darwin states, \\"To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause.  It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old an ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.\\"      Darwin very systematically looks at a number of objections and problems to his theories - for example:    \\"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\" p.217    \\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not have possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.  But I can find no such case...\\" p.219    \\"If it could be proved and any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\" p.228-229    \\"Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory.  The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.\\" p.292     \\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\" p.309    It is important to note, however, that after each of these possible explanations Darwin gives credible thoughts as to how these (and other objections) could be overcome.  He often \\"freely admits\\" that not all will believe his theory based off of his arguments, and I find that the general tenor of the book is humble: at times a little too apologetic (in the \\"I'm sorry for this\\" sense) ashe often states that [putting all the details here would be impossible].  I'm actually thankful for that as at times the book became frightfully boring as he listed fact after fact about different species/varieties of creatures.  Don't get me wrong though: there were many shining moments of interest as I read.  For example the section on ants (p.243ff), the bit about the seeds in the mud that he studied (p.374ff) and the section on the metamorphosis of the cirripedes which I found to be stunningly interesting (p.420ff).      Darwin's tremendous volume of study is clear throughout the book: the ease that he demonstrates in switching his focus from animal to animal and issue to issue was extraordinary - it would be fantastic to actually meet him and watch his mind work.      I think that Darwin's most significant contribution in the book overall is showing just how dependant the entire world is on each other - I think that we could all learn a lot from this very true concept.  On page 125 he states, \\"Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district\\" just to name one such instance of interdependence.      Another sort of `theme' that emerges in the book is Darwin's need for an actual explanation of why things are the way they are (pp.67, 399, 415-417, et. al.).  He's not happy to just say \\"such and such was created thus\\" - he want to know WHY they are the way that they are.  The Bible (both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament) are really never interested in the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" of creation - only that ultimately God was responsible.  With this pointed out, I can confidently say that nothing in \\"The Origin of Species\\" contradicts anything that's in the bible to any sort of severe degree, outside of staunch strict literalism, which the Biblical texts by no means demand.    I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the core of the ideas that have become so prevalent in today's world.  I'll end my review with one last quote, which is what Darwin states at the very end of the book (pp.459-460):    \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixes law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"
B000UR9T8C|5.0|So, Spidey gets a little mean in this one.  I'd say it has half as much to do with the symbiotic alien life form known as Venom that attaches itself to him, and half to do with Mary Jane's hedonistic, prostitutorial ways.  Allow me to explain...<br /><br />While Spidey is solving crime, risking his life, and being a hero, he still has to deal with family and a girlfriend.  And his cult hero status - something won with much difficulty - doesn't seem to sit well with Mary Jane.  During a celebration of Spiderman saving the day once again, along with the life of a beautiful young blonde who makes Mary Jane look like a ginger hobo, the attention Spiderman gets is just a bit too much.  She can't stand someone else being the center of attention, and since she got her little feewings hurt by getting fired from a musical, she was looking to redirect the pain.  Spidey gets a celebratory kiss and Mary Jane, being the whore she is, cheats on Spiderman without any sympathy whatsoever.  Seriously, who cheats on Spiderman!?<br /><br />Unfortunately, she also helps to turn Spidey into a complete idiot, prancing around like a complete retard and making a fool of himself in front of every attractive woman he sees.  He pops his collar and gets an emo haircut, and is obviously emotionally damaged.  Luckily, he takes a date to Mary Jane's place of employment and teases her unmercifully, and she deserves every second of it.<br /><br />Along the way Spidey continues the battle versus the legacy of the Green Goblin, as well as the Sandman, and the aforementioned Venom (with new host).  Tons of action, great special effects, and the perpetual cameos of Stan Lee are all present.<br /><br />I loved the movie; it was an incredible comic adaptation, but I obviously hated Mary Jane.
B00114LF4E|5.0|As well detailed by Santa Fe Reviewer, this set represents a remarkable standard of playing and recording. I currently own several of these performances and can only add to the praise.<br /><br />A few additional points:<br /><br />The Holst Planets here offered is the recording that set that work free from any residual insularity associating it with other British symphonic works of its time, such as the the Elgar symphonies. As everyone knows it's now a huge concert and recorded favorite around the world. Although there have been many recordings since Karajan's with the Vienna this breakthrough issue remains one of the very finest. Karajan's ability as a great conductor in what was unfamilair territory is here most evident.<br /><br />Also not to be overlooked is the ballet music. Karajan was perhaps at his very best in the big Tchaikovsky ballets, Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty, and these selections do not disappoint. The Giselle is also suprisingly well-done, with the Vienna Philharmonic bringing a lusty richness to a score too often under-played.<br /><br />The Strauss selections showcase beautiful sound along with fine performances by a master in this music. Karajan was one of the premiere specialists in the music of Richard Strauss, and hearing him lead the sensationally recorded Vienna Philharmonic in these delectably decadent symphonic tone poems can only be described as a truly sybaritic experience!<br /><br />Over the years I have come to appreciate Karajan's Brahms more than I did as a young listener, when Brahms symphonies meant Furtwangler, Klemperer or Toscanini. On these works Karajan does an excellent very musical job, and the Vienna catches just the right darker Autumnal tone for these elegaic-laced works.<br /><br />The Grieg was also a Karajan 'Specialitie de la Maison', and receives a fine ambient recording in a style Decca would develop and carry over in their excellent sounding Sibelius recordings made a few years later with the Vienna under Maazel.<br /><br />Karajan's first major phase as a recording artist begins with his time with the Philharmonia and EMI during the fifties. Many of those fine performances are currently available. This Decca nine CD set capturing the complete second major stage of Karajan's recording career with the Vienna Philharmonic under the direction of Decca's legendary engineers gives us another look at the legacy of this dominating figure from the second half of the 20th century's classical music scene.<br /><br />I was delighted to find this listing and send this set out as a present - it's makes a superb gift!zel.<br /><br />Karajan's first major phase as a recording artist begins with his time with the Philharmonia and EMI during the fifties.

B00005JPTK|3.0|...but, as the credits show, this is an adaptation of someone else's screenplay.  Presumably the screenplay of the Charlton Heston version , \\"The Omega Man.\\"   And this film has much more in common with the Heston movie than it does with Richard Matheson's story. The most faithful adaptation of \\"I Am Legend\\" so far, honestly, is the Vincent Price version: \\"Last Man On Earth.\\"      This is a good ride, all the same. Will Smith is always likeable (though shirtless chin-ups and broken bridges are getting to be the signature components of his work). And the plague victims, cheesy video game baddies that they are, will give you the heebie-jeebies at all the right times.    One thing the Charlton Heston and Vincent Price versions kept from the Matheson novel -- sorely missed here -- was the nightly taunts from the plague victims: \\"Neville, come out!\\"     A fair movie in its own right, but -- like the far-worse \\"The Time Machine\\" travesty - I can't forgive the filmmakers for doing a pastiche of someone else's decades-old movie and trying to sell it as a high-quality adaptation of a classic novel. See it, but read the Richard Matheson book, too.
B000EZMIC4|1.0|I haven't seen a version of Pulse on DVD that looks like this. The version that is in stores is two discs and contains a different image. It's in 5.1 and has extras, as well as the concert paced out over two discs. This one looks to be best avoided.
0807126063|4.0|it was really quite easy to be morbidly fascinated with Ignatius J. Reilly. from his fantastical perceptions about himself and his fate, his indignation about the offenses made against his senses both welcome and repellent, to his obliviousness on the ripple-effect of his actions (and sometimes mere presence) on the people around him--no one is spared from his sharp tongue and the myriad sonorous digestive reverberations he emits.<br /><br />i enjoyed the verbosity of the...er...protagonist's(?) narrative as he bemoans fickle Fortuna's taunts on his luck. sometimes i found myself incredulous at the things that he spouts and the things that he do in the name of theology and geometry. more often he himself is the one blatantly offensive--especially to his oft-called \\"poor momma\\", but there is a certain understandable vulgarity in his actions when coupled with his delusions. in a sense you are made to think about the various circumstances in society that might have impelled an ordinary boy to suddenly become cynical and even antisocial.<br /><br />though his and the other characters' unintentional escapades were entertaining to read, there were still times when i found some scenes a bit lagging. and sometimes Ignatius' bouts into self-righteousness in one minute and then self-indulgence in the next became tiring. nevertheless, through it all, there is that lure to know what happens next. will our brazen fighter for peace and preserver of moorish dignity account for his actions? will he ever be able hold on to a job for more than a week? and what of the colorful correspondence with the minx Myrna, who seemingly is bent on throwing him on the nearest horizontal fixture to do carnal damage on his not insignificant bulk? how about the luckless Detective Mancuso with his fumbling ghastly contrivances to catch a \\"suspicious\\" character in the Quarter? A Confederacy of Dunces is an enjoyable and provocative read, with an antihero too incredible for words. Read it and be the judge.
B000N3STBQ|5.0|My new favorite album in the world.  What a revelation.  I missed this one completely in the 80s, maybe because of the lack of big \\"hits\\", but I finally picked it up in 2007.  Since then it's been the most-played CD by far in my rotation.  The tracks delight every time with a variety of energies and moods, atmospheric, danceable and mature, with gorgeous vocals from Gahan and Gore, and sophisticated blends of synthesizers and other sonic surprises, like the rockets on the title track.  The sweet spot for me is \\"A Matter of Time\\" + \\"Stripped\\".  The DVD is a mildly interesting account of their touring and the making of the album.  The album is simply terrific, perfect for aging new-wavers.
B000006TRV|5.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, and I honestly think they're the best Rock N' Roll band ever. From 1970 to 1983 they released one masterpiece after another, and Roger Waters is definitely among the few people that can be considered a songwriter genius.<br /><br />Now about the album, what else is there to say? Is the 3rd best-selling album in USA history, with 23 million copies sold. As a matter of fact this number is bigger, as the last time that RIAA updated the numbers from this album was in 1999.<br /><br />The mixing is astonishing, is at the same level of audio quality that any digital album released nowadays, just crystal clear. The package is really deluxe, and the music and lyrics are perfect.<br /><br />Just look to the ranking of sales in Amazon right bellow the product information, the last time I saw it was in the top 100. This album is timeless!
B000W4KT64|5.0|Well if you saw this in the movies you know how wonderfully funny this is.  Being from Baltimore just made it that more special.  This version of the film could not be better, the cast exceptional.  When I got the dvd and watched it, I couldn't believe I could have enjoyed the movie more from the first time.  Great a real keeper.
B000I9VO76|4.0|A Diplomat's world is turned upside down, and those he trusts become enemies.  Spies, betrayal, lies, and manipulations destroy a cultured life.  Suddenly, the world around him is revealed, and he realizes that he was living in a world separated from the real world.<br /><br />Sure, the Brits make for some slow moments, but their is also a lot of action, henchmen, and plot twists to keep you interested.  More is revealed, as the movie unfolds, and we sympathize with those affected by the complicated governmental \\"influences.\\"<br /><br />There are cultural and other aspects of this film which give it added power and which give the viewer more perspective.  I do not want to give anything away, but this movie provides drama, action, and mystery.  This is not a James Bond or Bourne film, but the action sequences balance the calm, slower scenes.  Both women and men would enjoy this one.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Great movie, my teenage boys got me to watch all the Bourne movies and I liked them but... why is it that all of the assassins in this movie are Arabic-looking men?  Does this play sublty on our fears about Arabic people or Muslims?  They couldn't find one Irish/German/English-looking/sounding actor to play at least one of the assassins?  OK, Desh, the assassin in Tunisia, makes sense but what about the bad guy in D.C. or the killer in London?  Why were they all dark-skinned with Mid Eastern features?
B0000AMRJC|5.0|As a teenager, I was a big fan of [[ASIN:B000ULPFGI Miami Vice: The Complete Series]], and I love [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)]] so I bought this 2 disk Anniversary edition of Scarface.<br /><br />At the time I purchased this, I had been listening to many Gangsta Rap and Hip Hop CDs, and I've read that many musicians are inspired by this film.  The Special Features explore the music industry's fascination with this classic movie.<br /><br />This is literally a story of \\"rags to riches,\\" and this is also a story of becoming power mad.  I was completely engaged and mesmerized by his rise to power, but it is sad to see that he let his power become paranoia and he hit his personal stash instead of being a business man.  He reminds me of Uncle Sam, right now.  Too much power, but not enough Self Control.<br /><br />America loves (and often votes for) its Gangsters, and this is a great tribute to the ideals of North America.  At the risk of being labled a \\"Turahist,\\" I love this movie and so do most North Americans.  Sad ending, but a great film.
B00005JPOO|5.0|A modern-day fairytale with a great message for everyone, but young girls in particular. This is a movie that will be enjoyed over and over again. Do yourself a favor: give this gem a chance.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|Finding Neverland (not Michael's place) is an interesting journey.  As always, Johnny Depp is perfect.  However this movie is not all fun and games, and refusal to grow up.  A sadness lurks in the shadows, and leaves me wanting to watch [[ASIN:0767836324 Hook]], again to liven things up.<br /><br />Great movie, but contains drama as well as humor.  You may teer up a bit, though the laughs prevail.
0143038419|5.0|The opening sentence intrigued me, and by the time I'd read the middle-of-the-night bathroom prayer scene that ended with the words, \\"Go back to bed, Liz,\\" I was captured. If you want to read a book about love, prayer, psychology, relationships, religion, pain, and different cultures, then Liz Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love is the book for you. If you feel like reading something that will make you laugh, cry, and ponder the mysteries of life, then get your own copy and start reading. And yes, you'll need your own copy because there are lots of phrases and passages that you'll want to underline and pages that you'll want to earmark for later rereading.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the book is about Gilbert's journey to find balance in spirituality and pleasure as she travels to Italy, India, and Indonesia. In each country the experiences are drastically different. In Italy, she enjoys eating (gains 23 lbs.), sight seeing, and meeting new friends (like Luca Spaghetti). In India, Gilberts spends a lot of time praying and meditating, familiarizes her readers with what life is like in an ashram, and \\"makes peace\\" with her ex-husband. In Indonesia, the medicine man, Wayan, and Felipe are but three of the people who teach her about love and \\"diligent joy.\\"<br /><br />I can't speak for the male of our species, but I sincerely think that every woman who ponders the meanings and mysteries of life will enjoy this book.
B0009W5JS2|4.0|Suspend disbelief, or Alter your mental state, and roll with it.  The plot is not particularly believable, but Ice Cube is the man on screen.  His attitude and person take over the movie, and he makes up for major plot holes in the film.  This one cannot be taken as realistically (?) as Van Diesel's [[ASIN:B0007Q6VXW XXX (Unrated Director's Cut)]], but this movie is fun and entertaining.<br /><br />If you think of the film as [[ASIN:B000087LIM Friday Collection (Friday / Next Friday / Friday After Next)]] meets XXX, its all good.  However I will watch anything with Ice Cube in the flick.  I think he was stretching it a bit on this one, but countless scenes compensate for the unbelievable aspects.  Have a Margarita, and roll with the inconsistencies.  The action and Tank Jacking are worth it.
B0011HF6GE|3.0|There are a couple of interesting songs here, such as Blindsided and Creature Fear/Team but even those songs are complicated by the multiple track falsetto vocals that make the lyrics difficult to hear--and what I can hear is very oblique and abstract.  I suppose for some (the critics) this may be the attraction of Bon Iver.  And if that sounds interesting to you then definitely check this out.  But for most listeners, even those who like indie and folk, I think this is going to have very limited appeal.
078401213X|4.0|This movie is disturbing, yet it is a classic because it is powerful.  Neuroses, Obsessive behavior, and mind boggling compulsions flow through the dark scenes.  Watch it straight, or you'll probably have flashbacks.  This movie is trippy.  Insanity and bodily betrayals prevent the mathematician from dealing well with reality, though he seems hell bent on proving the mathematical foundations of reality.<br /><br />Kabbalists, Occultists, thinkers, and philosophers will dig this one.  Stoners beware: paranoia pervades.  As a psychology student, the film reveals a steady descent into madness, but is the guy mad or extremely focused on his work?  All creative people are a little crazy, but this guy is scary.  I am still not sure how to evaluate the main character of the movie, but it makes people think so I recommend it.
B000ZN8036|1.0|I realize that this movie attempts to portray an actual life.  And knowing the young man and the story (the half I was able to sit through) only through a lot of artistic license and speculation, I will reserve judgment on the real Chris McCandless.  But the self-righteous, self-obsessed, grandiose brat portrayed on the screen is no one whom I could ever care about.  I don't know what the basis is for medicalizing his lousy character and personality, but I'm not quick to buy into that sort of thing...not for people who are able to function in the normal world and relate normally to other people when and while it serves their interests.  I guess maybe he wrote some real crazy-sounding stuff before he died, but anybody'd lose it a little in those circumstances.  Going into the situation though, I just see a brat about whom I could not possibly have cared less.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Well, the CIA would probably agree with Lesson #9: \\"In order to do Good, You may have to Engage in Evil\\"....  Seriously, this film makes people evaluate or re-evaluate thoughts about War.<br /><br />This is an interesting documentary, for many reasons.  Other people have thoroughly reviewed this, so I am only adding my \\"two cents.\\"  Some folks hate documentaries, but this is worth seeing and purchasing.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I'm not going to write a book here about the movie, all I can say is see it for yourself.  I thought it was an excellent story/musical.
0143038419|5.0|I am sorry for all the naysayers about this book and especially that Amazon has placed their reviews first. I had a bit of trouble getting into the book, expecting it to grab me like a cheap novel and pull me in..but as I continued my read, I laughed out loud, cried tears in the memory of trips to the same pizza place in Naples, descriptions of Italy, her frustrations of trying to meditate in India, etc througout the book and was enlightened by the simple lessons that she learned and shared along the way.  I have given this book to many and they all had the same positive reactions.  It is a very worthwhile book and I can only say that if you do not enjoy it or find some value in reading it, that there is some internal resistance to her voice...Open your hearts and mind and re-read it!
0312360266|3.0|I like the premise of this novel: a vampire school and hot vampire romance.  I even give the authors kudos for making the sexual references hotter than most young adult publishers dare to.  However, the language was way too juvenile, even for a young adult novel. It was like the authors were trying too hard to show us they know how teenagers talk nowadays.  Also, the characters had the corniest three-musketeers type of dialogue. It was kind of cringeworthy, especially the cheesy \\"you're right, twin\\" and \\"oh no, you're right, twin\\" banter between Shaunee and Erin. At times, it felt like I was reading the script for an episode of Barney and Friends. I wish the writers hadn't dumbed down the language. But it was still enjoyable to a certain degree and I think a lot of people will end up liking this book and the series.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|Oh what a huge disapointment this move was...The premise was so very cool, what happens when you're (supposedly) the last person on earth. I kept thinking the movie would have been far more interesting, if they hadn't jumped into it, with Smith's character already 3 years into living in the city all alone , and showed him gradually living and adjusting to it from the git go. As it is, your left scratching your head about all the odd things going on...like how and why a deadly 'virus' turns ordinary humans into panting, blood thirsty zombielike characters, whose sole motus operandi seems to be wanting to kill Smith's character (funny how viruses will do that to you :P) There were other , equally confusing things....in the flashbacks, we see that Smith's character was a colonel...yet in his basement , we see him in full 'scientist' mode, white lab coat and all, injecting rats with hopeful cures?...maybe he's a scientist/colonel lolol...And the absolutely goofy part where the zombiething has Smith nearly in his clutches, only to be saved by a lady who strolls in from Maryland with her son , at dusk, unattacked, apparantely 'on her way' to a colony of non-zombies somewhere...The entire movie just lacked cohesion and the CGI'd animals and zombies never did give the illusion of realness. So much more could have been done with such a fascinating premise. Very disappointed in this one.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I generally agree with the other positive reviews -- this is a fun, engaging fantasy movie with nice humorous touches.    But I have to say that Robert Deniro makes a TERRIBLE gay pirate, and that his portion of the film really detracts from the overall experience.  His performance is borderline offensive, but also just really, really unconvincing.  It's as if he's trying to channel Robin Williams from The Birdcage and failing miserably.    That aside it's good fun, and solid performances all around.  Definitely worth a look.
B000009QPE|5.0|I'll admit that Slayer has released a few albums over the years that just didn't do it for me. They were either too far out there, or just felt like a cudgel rapping you in the head monotonously for an hour - either smack me around like you mean it, or go away.    But \\"Reign in Blood\\" is an exception, along with \\"Hell Awaits\\", \\"South of Heaven\\", and \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\". This relatively short album packs a lot in to the thirty minute or so runtime. Some protest that there's no variation to the songs here, but I'm not of that opinion at all. There's more than enough to keep one interested and the best part is that at times, it almost feels like a rabid dog is grabbing you by the back of your neck and preparing to snap your spine. It's really good like that.     Overall, I'd say that this is one of the milestones in speed metal, without a doubt. I saw Slayer perform this album live on the Jägermeister Tour a few years back. On the way out, my friend found a tooth in one of the grooves of his boot sole. That's when you know you've been to a good show.
0452289963|5.0|It is a very good book, very insightful and makes you think and reprioritize your goals. A must read!
B000002B7M|5.0|This was the first of Ozzy's two studio albums with the legendary guitarist Randy Rhoads. In my opinion, these were the golden days for Ozzy. There is a passion and a playfulness to the whole thing that far outstripped his later work, which became formulaic, staid, and commercial. All kudos to the guy and his wife - they made a killing. But before the wheelbarrows of loot really started rolling in, there was a time when Ozzy worked magic alongside a brilliant guitar player whose sound still inspires today.     The songs on this album and Diary of a Madman allowed me to cut my teeth as a teenage metal guitar player. To this day, I have many fond memories whenever a track comes up on the radio, or on iPod shuffle. This is just one of those classics that never really gets old for me.
0380789035|4.0|I had some exposure to Gaiman's work reading a couple of his Sandman stories. I am not really into reading fiction anymore. I haven't finished reading a novel in many years. Which is part of why I bailed on the dream of becoming a novelist myself. How can you write novels if you don't even like reading them anymore? Back in the day I was a voracious of reader of fantasy novels IF they were different enough, like Gene Wolfe's stuff. But that was like twenty years ago.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed reading about mythological characters in a contemporary/alternative history setting, though. Like Orson Scott Card's \\"Seventh Son\\" series and \\"Heroes in Hell\\" (I read all of the \\"Son\\" series but only the first one of the \\"Heroes\\"). So when I heard about \\"American Gods\\" I thought, well, this guy Gaiman seems like he writes some different stuff, so I'll give it a try. But the damn thing was always checked out at the library, whenever I remembered to look for it. And I've been too broke for a couple of years to buy any new books at $15 plus (plus my wife would kill me). I am a part time instructor at a local community college, and the wallet is rather thin these days. Real thin I mean.<br /><br />Then last week I was in the library reading the Gaiman book that was in, \\"Fragile Things\\" and read the novella  \\"Monarch of the Glen.\\" I was enchanted enough with this sequel to \\"American Gods,\\" that I looked again but \\"Gods\\" was still checked out. So I went online to read a little about it, and whaddaya know, you could read it online! For free! At least until the end of March..thanks Harper-Collins and Mr. Gaiman!<br /><br />So I read it online over the last week. Yep. All of it, all the way through, online. Wow. This is a good, good book. For me to finish a novel all the way through...online even, pretty much says the regard I hold this book in. I will buy it someday, when my ship comes in and/or I see a copy at the used bookstore.<br /><br />I would rate it five stars but as a Native American some of the parts about Native American mythology didn't work for me, and as an archaeologist the little scene on the First Americans didn't feel right either, though I appreciate what he was trying to get at. I really liked Shadow and his wife Laura; their love felt real to me. I hope to see Shadow some more in future works by Mr. Gaiman.<br /><br />Not too much I can add though that the 600 plus other reviewers ain't already said better. Damn good read.s about Native American mythology didn't work for me, and as an archaeologist the little scene on the First Americans didn't feel right either, though I appreciate what he was trying to get at.

B000002H33|5.0|It's hard to think of the 1980s without stumbling over a fond memory of Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\". I must have heard this album at least three hundred times as a teenager - at home by myself with headphones, hanging out at parties, driving along in the car, at the beach, in the jam shack, the studio, etc... etc... It was everywhere in my circle of friends and it was worshipped (rightfully so) as the best metal album going at the time.     So here we are, twenty-two years later...! Let me take a moment to think about that.     On second thought, nevermind...I don't really want to think about that part.     I was fifteen years old when this album showed up at Camelot Music in the spring of 1986 and we all raided the store for our own copies. My reaction to this release was almost identical to that of my thirteen year old stepbrother when Halo 3 hit the shelves last year. The guy behind the counter couldn't bag the disc and receipt fast enough. I was near to salivating as we rushed my friend Dave's mom to the car, urged her to drive faster en route to their house, and then scrambled inside and up the stairs for his cassette player. It all climaxed in the quasi-flamenco intro to \\"Battery\\" and we just sat there, dumbfounded. Dave and I were both guitar players, which made the heel of that boot kicking us in the face seem so much larger.     But hey, rather than continue this rambling review, I'll just state the obvious: this is one of my all-time favorite albums, even today after so many years removed from my first copy of it. Metal has progressed in some areas and regressed in others, but Master of Puppets stands as a strong reminder of the Golden Age.
1585673927|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about the inimitable P.G. Wodehouse???      Carry On, Jeeves is a great starter book for those who are intimidated with the amount of J&W books available (or rather, don't know where to begin).  The first story in this book is about the first day Bertie Wooster met his personal gentleman (or valet, if you prefer), Jeeves.  The stories easily stand on their own; with the exception of characters being mentioned or being part of the plot, the book is not a novel you have to read front to back.  Consider it a literary sitcom, where new scenarios and conflicts arise with each story you read.    My favourite bit about reading Carry On, Jeeves was the last story of the book, where it takes a refreshing twist and is narrated by Mr. Jeeves rather than Bertie Wooster.  It was great reading from Jeeves's perspective.      Lots of chuckles throughout and a few hardy laughs.  Overall a perfect read.
B000002H2H|5.0|I first heard this album at the age of 14. My rock/metal experience up to that point was composed primarily of Zeppelin, AC/DC, and Ozzy (Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman were my favorites). One of my friends introduced me to Metallica one afternoon and it was like a cannon report in the early morning hours! I sat up and took notice immediately as \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" kicked things off with a nice clean channel guitar harmony that suddenly exploded with intensity.     It was like waking up to a whole new perspective. I've had this experience a few times before and since, including Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\", Tool's \\"Aenima\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", and John Coltrane's \\"Blue Train\\".     Being a guitar player, I picked \\"Fade to Black\\" as the first track to learn from the album. The remainder I learned over the next couple of years. \\"Creeping Death\\" was on the cover set list for my first band and I loved butchering Kirk Hammett's solo on a regular basis. \\"Call of Ktulu\\" never allowed me to forget (even when Megadeth's \\"So Far, So Good... So What?\\" came out) that Dave Mustaine was still out there somewhere and his unique brand of metal music genius wouldn't remain dormant for long.     It's my opinion that this is no \\"Master of Puppets\\". I realize that it's all subjective and many Metallica fans would argue otherwise, but I'm going to stick to my guns here. RtL is an awesome release in its own right...but MoP is as close to divinity as a metal album can get without bursting into flames.     All sumo foot-stompin' aside...you really cannot go wrong with this one. I played one cassette and one CD of this album to death during my teen years and it has since found a new digitized home on my iPod, where it'll remain for years to come. I'd even venture a guess that I'll probably be barking about the wasted youth of some future generation from my wheelchair, while Ride the Lightning pops a speaker in the background.
B00005JPTK|5.0|I didn't care much for the book - there's not much to vampire stories.<br /><br />But what they did with the movie really impressed me.

B000002U82|5.0|How does one go about topping an album like Dark Side of the Moon? Talk about stress when going into the studio for the next major release. While I love their subsequent works - especially Animals, The Wall, and The Final Cut (though this last one can be an emotionally difficult listen) - if Pink Floyd had called it quits right after DSotM, they would still be legends in my opinion. This album is just so good on so many levels. \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\", \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"...from opening heartbeat all the way through to the last bar of \\"Eclipse\\", it's simply an amazing musical experience.     Part of what sets this one out for me is that everyone seems to be present and accounted for. There's no hint of the Gilmour and Waters sumo shove-fest, but rather a moment when the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few. It shows in the composition and the delivery.     Given that there's over 1,300 reviews, I won't be able to add much to the conversation here. Suffice it to say that this album been a constant in my library since age 16 and has rarely sat idle over the years. For an album to transcend generation and maintain a strong following from 1973 to 2008 (35 years and counting!) should be a clear sign of how special it truly is.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|If you want to see the full, uncut versions of the Original Star Trek series, with the new enhanced graphics, this set is the only way to go. As a first generation Star Trek fan, I am overjoyed with the makeover the program is getting. In recent years I've watched the unaltered version of the show on Cable and winced with pain at the plywood sets and the same seven stock shots of the Enterprise and the same planet model used over and over again. The special effects of 1967 no longer carry the story and I began to fear that future generations might begin to wonder what the fuss was about. No longer! I love the updated special effects. I think Gene Roddenbury  would like them as well. We saw with Next Generation what he really wanted to do with the original series had he the technology and the budget to do so. Even better, since these episodes are uncut for commercials, I've seen material in some of these episodes that I haven't seen since they first aired. What you see on TV these days are so badly cut up that vital parts of the dialog and story are missing. Now you can see the shows as intended. And somehow it seems fitting that a failed Sci-Fi show that refused to die should be the swan song for a dying format (HD DVD). No doubt seasons II and III will be produced in Blu-Ray format. Since these disks are hybrid, you can watch them on a standard DVD player as well as a HD DVD player. And at half the original price, these disks are a bargain for the hard-core Trek fan.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I was at first put off by this film's setting. I immediately saw it was going to take place on the seamy side of Boston, among druggies and other low-lives. Since I'm more a fan of the drawing room mystery genre, I felt a big chore coming on with this film.     Also, it was a challenge understanding some of the heavy Boston accents. Several of the actors here seem to have been coached to assume truly over-the-top dialects, thicker than any I've encountered among real Boston natives. This was probably done to give the movie a strikingly distinctive regional flavor. But I actually had to turn on the DVD's English subtitles for a while - until my ear got better attuned to the speech and until some of the lead actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman came on the scene. Their back-stories provided them with different upbringings and allowed them to speak a more standard Midwestern English.    So again, between the unsympathetic characters and the difficult language, I initially resigned myself to watching this film through just to get my money's worth and to avoid being a quitter. But before I knew it, I found myself genuinely engrossed. Even if your usual preferred material is Agatha Christie rather than the Lehane book this is based on, I think you will also be drawn into real involvement with and appreciation of this movie.     Then you'll want to go back and listen to Ben Affleck's Director's Commentary. At first sounding a little low-key and sluggish, it also soon winds up into fascinating insight. Like me, I bet you missed that wink between characters signaling unexpected complexities to the plot.     \\"Gone Baby\\" would be a good movie to view with friends, because it will probably provoke lively discussion afterwards - with your friends falling into two opposing camps, each with its reasons. A movie that starts out appearing to be about uniformly dreary lives, will end up inspiring you to take sides, and to remember and challenge long after the credits have rolled.
B00000JHAU|5.0|If I had to choose the best Belle & Sebastian album ... I couldn't.    But \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" is the album I'd recommend for anyone who is looking to listen to some of their older music because they like a newer release and want a good starting place to get into some of their older stuff.     Alternately, if you've heard \\"Tigermilk\\" and/or \\"Boy with the Arab Strap\\" and like them, then this album is a more melancholic, complex, sophisticated, and oddly arousing take on their older story-like songwriting style.    When this album was released, the band never did publicity and it was next to impossible to find a picture of any of them. They sent out press photos with them in a classroom with their heads down on a desk.    Stuart David, then-bass player for the band, was really into this ink polaroids concept, where words better captured a person in a moment of time than taking a photo would because they wouldn't know they're being photographed. This was Stuart David's last album recorded with the band, and when he left the band they started doing publicity, interviews, playing more shows, toured and Stuart Murdoch's face and comments started appearing in many fan zines. Stuart David made his side project, Looper, his full time gig.    \\"Fox in the Snow\\" is lead singer Stuart Murdoch's favorite song, at least that's what he said to my friend in 2001 after my friend told him that her 4-year-old's favorite song was \\"Fox in the Snow.\\"    The title track, \\"If you're feeling sinister,\\" goes on to say, \\"go off and see a minister. He'll take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever.\\" So a lot of hipsters and critics wondered if the band was, heaven forbid, religious. I like the line in that song where he says, \\"She was into S&M and bible studies, not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me ...\\"    The only thing I don't like about this album is occasional song endings with blaring horns that seem to go on forever.    The best thing about early Belle & Sebastian albums is you can listen to them over and over again and always find something new, or catch something you missed before, and it's smart, insightful, poetic somethings that often make you feel better.     \\"If you're feeling sinister\\" has several tracks with really dense, woven, pretty stories and characters in them.
B000002TLX|5.0|I loved Richard Marx when I was a teenager, and listening to this album makes me remember why!  All of the hits I expected, plus a few I wasn't as familiar with, but love just as much now that I've listened to them.  The thing I especially like about this CD is that the liner notes are written by Richard where for each song he gives an insight into what was going on with his life and why he recorded it.  If you ever liked any of Richard's songs in the past, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.

0312360266|4.0|Early on in my reading of Marked, I wasn't at all sure I would like this young adult novel.  The story of Zoey Redbird, a sixteen year old girl who is unhappy at home, becoming \\"marked\\" as a fledgling vampyre, just seemed a bit forced.  I wanted to feel a part of her story but her angst was overwhelming and I couldn't really see where the plot was headed.  However, about midway through, the book picked up steam and by the last few chapters, I was eagerly turning the pages in order to find out how Zoey's unusual powers would manifest and where it all would lead.<br /><br />Marked is an imaginative take on vampyres, weaving \\"old\\" pagan religious themes throughout and incorporating ancient history into its background.  I liked the idea of a society where vampyrism is openly known and accepted, and I liked the School of Night where fledgling vampyres are taken for further training.  I loved Zoey's learning to accept herself and step up as a leader at the school, and even the cursing seems realistic.  What I didn't like was the obvious prejudice against traditional religion, and the \\"mini-sermons\\" we receive early on against drugs, drinking, and oral sex from Zoey's point of view.  I liked Zoey's friends but felt that her acceptance into such a tight group so immediately didn't ring true, and I had to wonder at just why Erik, the hot young vampyre, was so attracted so quickly to Zoey.  There are also some very lucky coincidences, such as Zoey's Native American grandmother having taught her purification rites which come in very handy. Thankfully these annoyances were overcome by the general storytelling and the excitement of the last half of the book.<br /><br />Marked is the first in the series and I'll definitely be looking for the next two.  I am captured by Zoey's world and want to see how her special spiritualism develops over time.  This book also left enough unanswered questions that I'm drawn to find out more.  With a caution that this book would probably be better for more mature readers with its incidents of sexual tension and cursing, I can say I'm intrigued enough to recommend this one.e readers with its incidents of sexual tension and cursing, I can say I'm intrigued enough to recommend this one.

B0013FFMOK|3.0|Hello,<br />I like Will Smith. I usually like his films. I found both versions of this one lacking, though. The heart of the problem is an incomplete story. It's flawed in its addressing of the infected inhabitants, & in explaining the viral infection. He declares victims as having become completely devolved, w/no higher thought processes left intact. Then they're shown to adapt his own snare equipment in trying to capture him. Even the alternate film, which addresses this flaw somewhat, just doesn't add up. How did the virus go from Cancer cure, to global pathogen? What was the army's involvement? Weaponization? Also, while doing a one actor film is tough. I think the story could've been portrayed better. Incidentally, did anyone else notice the infected leader's strong facial resemblance to the robot in \\"I, Robot?\\" I'm betting it was the same digital model of the actor from that film. I was looking forward to this movie. I'm afraid this one disappointed. Oh well. You can't hit a home run every time, right?

I say heavy because you need to listen to every details of all the instruments being played (not only the guitar)<br />2) Listen to all the tracks without interruption and any breaks, all the way to the end of the CD (Track 5, the Title song, which is the albums' peak is going to make you have a break but be prepared and hang in there!!)<br />Track 5 is amazing... one of the greatest musical pieces of all time.<br />3) You probably need to listen to it soon for a second time, this time with a friend who understands music like yourself.<br /><br />My own conclusion:<br />The most satisfaction you'll get from Andy's music is that he always hits the notes that you expect to hear next, when he is at the peak of the track.<br />Have I ever bought any of his works with disappointment?

B000RW3YYA|5.0|This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.    One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.    I do have a few comments about this season:    1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air' makes the episodes more suspenseful.     2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn't she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?    3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he'd wear a uniform. Don't they ever get cold?    4. Dr. Weir's (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.    5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.    6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn't an \\"ancient\\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There's so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn't.     7. The episode \\"Common Ground,\\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren't Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.     The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can't wait for season 4!

B000QUCNP4|5.0|It is horrifying to think that all the events in this movie actually took place, and more terrifying still that the serial killer might still be at large after over 30 years of evading the police. (Note: though the case is still open in many states, the killings have stopped, and the author, Robert Graysmith, believes the Zodiac is dead).    This movie is not about the Zodiac killer himself, but about the people involved in his pursuit, and especially with the obsession of one police detective and one cartoonist to catch him. The killings are gruesome, with some victims repeatedly stabbed to death, while others shot at close range with a hand gun. None of the victims were sexually molested, and they were not robbed of their personal belongings. The killer derived pleasure from killing his victims. As he later tells police in letters sent to newspapers, he kills in order to collect his victims as slaves for the next life! He always started his letters with, \\"This is the Zodiac speaking.\\"    There was one instant where the killer might have been caught. After the Zodiac (as the killer calls himself) shoots a taxi driver, a police car is called to the scene after the gun shot is heard. However, witnesses mistakenly reported a black man at the scene. The Zodiac is a chubby white man. When the police arrive near the scene, they see the Zodiac walking, and stop by him to ask him if he had seen a black man in the area. He says yes and points to the direction he allegedly saw a black man with a gun running. If the police would have stopped and interviewed the Zodiac more closely, they would have seen his bloody hands. There is no telling what would have happened then. The policemen could have been shot dead, or maybe it would have been the other way around (there were two policemen in the car.) The Zodiac also called the police after committing some of the crimes - from phone booths adjacent to police stations!    Another chilling instant was when the Zodiac stopped a pregnant woman and her child on a road claiming that her back tire was wobbling. He volunteered to fix the tire, and while the woman watched from her side view mirror, he appeared to do just that. However, as soon as she drove off, the back tire completely came off and she had to stop. She was then kidnapped by the Zodiac and driven around for almost an hour, as if the Zodiac was looking for an ideal place to kill her. However, the woman, together with her child, managed to jump out of the car, and escaped death!    Not all of Zodiac's victims died. Although some victims were repeatedly stabbed, some survived! In all, it is believed that the Zodiac might have killed about 37 people.     It was quite amazing how an amateur code breaker was able to break the coded letter of the Zodiac within a day and a night. After the coded letter was published in a newspaper, neither the FBI nor the police were able to decipher the letter. However, an amateur man did! The FBI should have hired him!    This movie does follow the plot in the book `The Zodiac', by Robert Graysmith, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. This movie is much superior to other Zodiac movies I have seen. The acting is superb, and you will be kept in suspense throughout the movie. I did like the 70s look the movie portrayed.     If you have read the book by Graysmith, I highly recommend this movie. If you haven't read the book, then I recommend reading it before watching this movie. The movie does tend to jump from one scene to another without much cohesion at times, and if you did not read the book, you might not understand what is going on. The movie is also pretty long (about 3 hours), and my friends, who did not read the book, found it boring. I was captivated only because I knew what was going on, and the movie refreshed my memory on many of the chapters of Graysmith's book. I guess I was watching it more like a documentary than a feature film.
0060786523|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"big book.\\"  It weaves a simple tale into a complex time, and gives the reader a deep perspective on India of the early 50's as well as the meaning of friendship, religion, and politics.  In short it is everything you can ask for from a big book.  \\"War and Peace\\" is the closest thing to a \\"similar\\" novel, in scope and depth.  It contains many small satisfactions as well.  Knowing a thumbnail of the author's biography adds to the irony of Lata's final choice, and her friends' reaction to it.  But before Lata chooses, Seth includes a one-page chapter of infinite sadness, that I can't read without tears forming in my eyes, followed by a chapter that always makes me laugh out loud at its sweet hilarity.  Yes, I laughed, I cried.  What more can you ask?  It currently lives in my consciousness as my favorite novel.

Too bad their daughter is nothing close to reality.
B00005JPTK|2.0|[[ASIN:B0013FDM7E I Am Legend (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]<br /><br />I was unpleasantly surprised to find this movie to be nothing more than a very shallow rip-off of the 1970's classic \\"Omega-Man\\" starring Charleton Heston. So little was changed, in fact, that it rapidly becomes a tedious embarrassment. I understand that few quality screenplays are being produced nowdays, but I still loath cheap reproductions of modern classics. \\"Invasion of the body snatchers\\" starring Donald Sutherland was another movie that was recent re-made into a poor quality clone. My point is, why bother? Rent the earlier versions and judge them yourselves. I don't need to spend the money in theater, nor on DVD to enshrine the sad newest rip-off versions....<br /><br />Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but his starring in \\"Omega Man ReVisited\\" does little to rescue this movie.
0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:0977412148 Why Be Normal...your life can be so much better]]<br />I purchased this book as a gift for a friend.  I understand what living in the \\"now\\" means, so I had no burning desire to read it.  For some reason I decided to look it over before mailing it away.  Sometimes it is so good to be wrong.  I was fascinated and felt like I had come home.  It answered so many of my questions and confirmed my suspiciouns regarding religion, society and evolution.  Being raised Catholic I had many questions regarding God, Jesus, evolution, our purpose here on earth and so much more.  Many times I was told not to ask questions, to just listen and learn.  Other things were explained as being a mystery that those of faith accept.  This caused me to leave my religion and explore other faiths and question my own belief in God and Jesus.  I went on to write my own book:  \\"Why Be Normal...your life can be so much better\\".  It took me several years  because I was scared to write about religion.  My book is about challenging your beliefs to get better results in your life, and I found I could not leave religion out. So I tackled it head on and was scared once it was published.  Much of what I wrote were my own conclusions.  I've spent many a night wondering if I had done the right thing by publishing my opinions and challenging the Roman Catholic Church (and others) to let the truth be known.  Reading Eckhart Tolle's book has confirmed some of my suspicions allowing me to get over my fear and be proud of my work.  It has helped me to confirm my life's purpose: to lead and encourage other's to live their lives true to their hearts in total health peace and happiness. Hearing how somethings in the Bible have been incorrectly translated helps me make sense of the bible and of it's teachers.  For example; Sin is a greek word for \\"missing the mark\\".  Sin is not a terrible, punishable crime, but a goal that has been missed.  This wonderful book has answered many of my questions and brought me so much peace.  It has confirmed my belief that there is no need for guilt in religion, and helped me to understand the teachings of Jesus, Buddah, Mohammed and others. Eckhart Tolle is the teacher I have been looking for.  May you too find peace in awakening to your life's purpose.ght me so much peace.

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I have owned this DVD of The Passion of the Christ for over a year but I didn't sit down and see it for the first time until this Good Friday.  I delayed watching this movie all that time because I listened and read many people's descriptions of the brutal violence, which I allowed to sway me against it for a long time.  But now that I've finally seen it, I'm very glad I did.  The film is excellent, the acting across the board is superb - Jim Caviezel's incredible portrayal of Jesus will forever be the definitive cinema Christ for me,  the cinematography is also first rate, and the music is beautiful to listen to.  The violence is tough to watch but it is not gratuitous.  Jesus according to the Gospels did endure horrific brutality and Roman crucifixion was designed by the state to be a savage deterrent.  Two scenes that stick with me are the playful loving tenderness between Jesus and Mary when Mary calls Jesus inside for mealtime while he is busy building a table, and the other is Simon of Cyrene screaming at the people and soldiers to stop beating Jesus as he was lying on the ground, then whispering to Jesus that they are almost there as he helped him carry his cross to Golgotha.  That was a very powerful and moving scene, among many throughout the film.  Whatever anyone thinks of Mel Gibson as a person, he used his talent and considerable skill to create what has turned out to be one of the most important films ever made in cinema history. It will become an annual tradition for many to see it during Good Friday and Easter and will continue to have lasting influence and benefits in people's lives for a long time to come.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Oscar Wilde once wrote, \\"Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.\\" \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is almost beyond criticism; it doesn't really matter whether I or anyone else liked it or not, but the division manifest amongst its critics tends to support Wilde's conjecture.  From an artistic point of view, the film is completely uncompromising: the acting is inspired, the cinematography is brilliant, and the music provides a strikingly appropriate accompaniment to the visual imagery. The film is filled with rich symbolism, moments of heartrending beauty, and of course, disturbingly graphic and brutal acts of violence. One watches this movie with a combination of wonder and disgust. It is certainly not enjoyable to watch, but, rather, quite painful, but the spiritual reward reaped is well worth the suffering required to attain it. Highly recommended viewing.

1594489505|5.0|An author's second book after a great success often disappoints, but this is a worthy follow-on to The Kite Runner.  Like its predecessor, it tells the sad and often brutal story of recent events in Afghanistan, but does it with a glowing love and appreciation for the indomitable spirit of the people.  The characters are amazing real, and the reader cannot help but feel a kinship with them in spite of the foreign environment.  A book to love, laugh, and weep over.

B000002MFE|5.0|When you find yourself listening hungrily for the nuances of each individual note, when you find that the performances get better each time you listen to them, when you feel as if there is no bottom to the virtuosity and feeling in a performance, then you know that you've made some little connection with the mind of a genius. I am untutored in guitar technique, regrettably spotty on the history of the blues, but I can tell you that this is simply, modestly, great music.

It's incredible that these songs can come off as new and fresh and still maintain their Beatle essence! I especially love singing along to all of these songs in the car. I highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone that loves the Beatles or just great music.

B0000028P8|4.0|When Mariah Carey decided to do this concert, there was a lot of talk about her simply being a studio creation that was not nearly as talented as she was made to seem.  She hadn't really performed live at that point, and with the Milli Vanilli scandal still pretty fresh in many people's minds, having an artist prove themselves was more important than ever before.      Well, she did that.  She came out, and sang many of her big hits, and managed to show that she had promise as a live performer.  Though I can't say I prefer any of these versions over the studio recordings, each song sounds good in its own way, and you can hear she is having a good time.      This is not exactly an essential recording by any means.  If you just want her version of \\"I'll Be There,\\" you'd be happier with a greatest hits collection.  However, if you are a hardcore fan, or are just curious how she sounded live, this is a good album to have.
B0010V4TZU|2.0|Many here berate Vampire Weekend for being derivative.  I take exception to this.  At the end of the day, what pop act isn't?<br /><br />Each of the influences cited repeatedly in these reviews--Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel and David Byrne--has plenty of predecessors from whom they've borrowed plenty.  So, bumming a chord progression here and a measure there is hardly a crime.  It's called inspiration.<br /><br />Vampire Weekend's problem is not that it borrows, but that it fails to compliment its application with a truly distinguishing signature.  There's simply too little depth and it comes across more as a cover band than anything else.<br /><br />On the first pass, I missed this, thinking that \\"Mansard Roof\\" was unique lyrically and that the rhythmic structure of \\"Oxford Comma\\" was interesting.  Still, there was something missing.  The second time through, \\"unique\\" and \\"interesting\\" yielded to \\"cute (in the college freshman sense)\\" and \\"gimmicky.\\" By the third run, I no longer cared.  It was already stale.<br /><br />Then I stumbled upon \\"One (Blake's Got a New Face,)\\" which I found to be flat-out lame.  Minimalist synth, strained vocals, Talking Heads' \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\\" wrapped in a Noughties New York foil and re-served.  They even went so far as to place a sub-title in parentheses.  That did it for me.<br /><br />So, if you're throwing a frat party and need some peppy background noise, pick-up a copy.  For anyone else, listen to the Amazon streams, catch a few YouTube clips and claim with voguish pride that you've heard them.

0321525655|5.0|In this age of information overload and short attention spans, the ability to deliver clear and concise presentations is one of the most important skills.<br /><br />Instead, business presentations today are mostly long, unfocused and boring.  In a typical PowerPoint presentation, the audience is forced to sit through slide after slide of charts, bullet points and text while the presenter reads from the screen.<br /><br />As a result, both presenter and audience feel stressed and disengaged, and everybody ends up wasting their time (this common situation is also referred to as Death by PowerPoint).<br /><br />Garr Reynolds' quest to end PowerPoint presentations as we know them started years ago when, riding on the express train from Tokyo to Osaka, he had his epiphany: after watching a Japanese businessman nervously flipping through a printout of poorly designed PowerPoint slides in an obvious state of confusion, he decided to launch his Presentation Zen blog, now the most popular presentation design site on the web.<br /><br />Presentation Zen (the book) is organized in three main sections:<br />*Preparation<br />*Design<br />*Delivery<br /><br />In the way of the true classics, this book is more than a simple step by step tutorial.  It outlines an approach, a strategy to solve the complex communication issues of today.  It not only tells us how to do a presentation, but instead takes us on a journey to discover what is it that we need to communicate in the first place, and how to make it resonate with our audience.<br /><br />Here are some of the things I learned:<br /><br />*How to discover your core message (the one thing, and only one, that you want your audience to remember).<br />*The importance of having quiet time to think.  Busyness kills creativity.  We all need some quiet time alone to come up with our best ideas.<br />*Use two often forgotten PowerPoint tools: notes (so you don't have to read from the screen) and handouts (so you don't have to cram all the data on your slides)<br />*Less is more: remove from slides every single element that is not necessary and doesn't add to our core message.<br />*PowerPoint is not a document creation tool.  It's job is to provide visual aid to our presentation.  The slides themselves are not the presentation.<br />*Images are more powerful than words.<br /><br />Drinking from his own Kool-Aid, Reynolds packs his book with visual examples of great (and not so great) presentations, so we can see the difference.  Also, he summarizes the most important ideas at the end of each chapter, and links to great presentation resources on the web (my favorite is TED, where you can see the great presenters of our time in action).<br /><br />This book is not for everyone.  Those readers who are looking for a few quick tips on how to do a PowerPoint presentation may get impatient with the author's frequent and lengthy references to the Zen philosophy and concepts.<br /><br />However, if you bear with him, you will learn more than just do a presentation.  You will learn how to analyze and solve complex communications problems, how to see the big picture from your customers' perspective, and how to effectively position products and services in the marketplace.<br /><br />If you have to do presentations for a living (and who doesn't these days?) read this book and keep it handy for future reference.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I looooove it. I still watch it at least once a week even though I bought it 1 month ago. Rupert Penry-Jones is can I dare say it \\" as good as Matthew MacFaden \\" in Pride and Prejudice. That's how I compare it. Those 2 movies are very simmilar in my mind. If you liked Pride and Prejudice with Matthew MacFaden and Keira Knightley you should looooove Persuasion as well. Of course it's still a TV movie but in a BBC production with the Masterpiece   Theatre series. The actors are top notch no exceptions  I wish Hollywood would be able to make girls movies like   the British and specally  European acting, much more chemistry amoung the actors.
0321544080|4.0|I bought this book with Joe McNally's reputation in mind. I had read and heard from the NAPP team (National Association of Photoshop Professionals) that this should be your next book purchase.    I read the stories and looked at the pictures (basically that's the entire book) and found the stories amusing. If you don't have all the advanced equipment that Joe has or you don't have the luck to be in the right place at the right time with all that equipment (without an assistant) your shots won't be of the same caliber.    This book was amusing but disappointing. It is an autobiography on some of the photography experiences of Mr. McNally.  This book is not one to be purchased if you are looking for ways to take your photography skills to a higher level.

The acting was very good. Overall, a totally satisfying family movie --- Don't think I would be going without kids but it was a lovely message for kids and very enjoyable.
B001152TL6|4.0|People, PLEASE don't continue writing book-lenghted reviews for the movie itself instead of writing them for the PRODUCT shown here. You go even as far as doing a total interpretation of it. Jeez, there are forums for that, go to IMDB for example...    When I read a review from a DVD, I expect yes, maybe a little from the plot and some quick rating of the film itself, but more than anything else, I want to see info on the Special Features (what they are, what's their lenght), Video & Audio quality (standalone and compared to other editions), Language and subtitle subtitle options, insert... THE WHOLE PRODUCT AS A PACKAGE. Not an essay on how the movie was meant to be interpreted.    And you cannot review this edition until it actually comes out and you see it first hand, right? That's what I though. Thanks.

B000001FCB|5.0|This album is among the best ever recorded in Brazilian Music. Tom Jobim, one the most important popular composers of the 20th century, joins a younger band at the top of its shape. Everybody is playing extremely well, the arrangements are charmingly sophisticated and the sound has an unparalel groove. Elis Regina understands the beauty and blues of Jobim's musical ideas, who at the same time embraces the innovative energy of this band. The album is worthy from the first to the last song.
0312117337|5.0|I love using the Osho Zen Tarot.  This particular Tarot deck is very different from many others that I have worked with. While I am not a professional reader, I enjoy a variety of Tarot decks and artwork.  Most Tarot Decks have a positive and a negative slant.  Sometimes, to where it may be a bit nerve racking to look up the card description. The major difference with the Osho Zen Tarot, is that is manages to somehow remove a lot of the dualities we face in life.  Its like pulling cards for hope.  So even when the energies surounding a certain situation you are facing in life, would be \\"negative\\" according to many other Tarot Decks; Osho gives you an expansive view of the energies and 'positive' (for lack of a better word) way of looking at the situation for growth and understanding.  A definite deck for anyone looking to walk those higher paths of spirituality and for that lil' extra help sometimes, to see tough situations in a more hopeful spin and to glean off of those times personal greater states of awareness.  I record many of my Tarot and various Oracle readings in the Tarot Journal.  I love using the 'card stickers' so I don't have to draw lame looking boxes anymore. [[ASIN:1424340802 Tarot Journal]]
B000E1MTZE|4.0|HD DVD is the best high definition standard, and these movies really make the best out of it.

Good story on the human city and the war to defend it.

The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows.      \\"It's pretty grand,\\" Bill said. \\"God, I love to get back.\\"    This sound like a music to my ears. Bravo Ernest, you're a genius.

B000ZN8036|4.0|For a little while, I've always thought of the idea of going out into the world and experiencing all that there is to experience before tons of mortgage payments, careers and fears of being laid off and whatnot would overwhelm. It's not so much wanting to be \\"free\\" and live life without barriers but rather to get out there and see as much as you can before you settle into a life like everyone else has. The film, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of one who wanted to be free and not dragged down by materialism and unnecessary things without realizing the most important things at the same time.    The film tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a smart man recently graduated from university where he longs for a life that's more basic and natural than new cars and careers. After donating all of his rather extensive savings and burning the rest, abandoning his car and changing his name to \\"Alexander Supertramp\\", he goes on a 2 year journey that takes him all over America before he makes for his goal of Alaska where he spends his days in an abandoned bus and where his body was later found.    One thing that always bugs me about these \\"biopics\\" is that the film casts the subject in such a positive light that anything negative gets dismissed or at least excused because of their \\"genius and influence\\". While I can relate to the idea of just wanting to live and not be saddled by getting a job so I can move out so I can get to university and work 20 years for a job I don't love, his reasonings and viewpoints are a little bit naive even. In one scene after being told to get a career, he says no because it's a \\"20th century invention\\" which to me sounds more like rebellion against The Man rather than something he felt his soul/spirit needed. So it's more a story you can appreciate and maybe even get inspired by but it's not let's say Gandhi in its power.    The film though is quite gorgeous in how it was shot and a lot of its cinematography is quite picturesque and helps sell the idea of just being out there on your own. The music, supplied by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, is also a notable mention and it wasn't as intrusive or wrong as I thought it was going to be. Another praise I got to give is to Sean Penn who, to be honest, I never liked as an actor, preferring loudness and overexaggerated movements to help sell his character. But as a director here, he's more restrained and even has a good sense of pacing which for some reason is a big problem with some directors lately.    Like Zodiac and the Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Into the Wild was criminally overlooked by the Academy and proves not all the best films get to be the top 5 nominated. I wouldn't say this film was or is anywhere near my favorite film of last year, but I sure enjoyed it a lot.
7119005901|5.0|This is a great CD full of Rampal's great masterpiece. Although the flute legend has passed away for over ten years, his legacy lives on. His interpretation of these pieces are splendid and one can truly appreciate his work. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the flute, especially those who want a different interpretation in music from someone other than James Galway.
B0002BO05S|2.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told    To begin: the desert cinematography reminded me of a John Ford's western.   In fact it was filmed in some of the same locales.  The American Southwest is a beautiful place, but it was not the right choice for a biblical epic.    Of course, the music of Alfred Newman was beautifully performed with parts of Handel's Messiah and Verdi's Requiem tossed into the mix. The Messiah's pieces were a bit jarring to one's concentration.      The music and the cinematography were nominated for academy awards.  Dr. Zhivago would take these Oscars.     The cast was a Who's Who of Hollywood from Charleston Heston as John the Baptist to John Wayne as the Roman Centurion.  Unfortunately, the famous cast was one of the movie's primary weaknesses.    Max von Sydow, the great actor, looked totally uncomfortable in the role of Jesus.  Those vivid blue eyes of his throughout the film detracted from the simple story of the carpenter from Nazareth whose message of peace and love changed the Roman World.     Charleston Heston's John the Baptist had moments of credence, but there were too many moments where the portrayal bordered on the comical.  The man who played Moses, Ben Hur, and El Cid deserved a better script.    The talented David McCallum's Judas was well done, even though the depth of Judas' struggle with his soul was only briefly touched on in this film.  His symbolic death at the altar was the last act of a movie which could have been the greatest story ever told. Since the law of God denounced human sacrifice and suicide, this was Judas' final act of blasphemy.       This was one of George Stevens' last films.  One can tell that he placed a great emphasis on reverence in this film, especially with the soft spoken words of the Gospels, the lavish sets and the piety on the faces of those who believed in Jesus.  It must have pained him greatly that the viewing public did not embrace his vision of the Christ.  Perhaps the problem was the turbulent mid-1960's.  This film was the last of the biblical epics for a long time to come.    With these failings, the movie became just one of the tales of the Christ in the film vaults of the world. Overall, it was a disappointing film with rare moments of beauty and pathos. For those who are not concerned about historical and biblical accuracy and just want an Easter treat, this would be a good film.

0385340540|2.0|John Grisham probably cannot write a bad book - \\"The Broker\\" is light and entertaining.  It also, however, comes across as the possible result of the author's extended vacation in Italy, replete with language lessons and a lot of dining in an endless variety of cafes. Many quarts of espresso are consumed in the flight of the hero.  The first few chapters sent me in search of the nearest Italian restaurant.    Unfortunately, the plot does not bear heavy scrutiny. The hero - who had access to some high tech wizardry contained on a handful of CDs during his Washington power broker days - is given a presidential pardon from prison and sent to Italy to assume a new identity.  Why? Because the ever-evil CIA wants to know which nation is most interested in these secrets.  They hope that by leaking his location to a group of international heavies (Israelis, Saudis, Chinese, etc.), they will learn something by sitting back and waiting for one of these to kill him.  How they would obtain usable info by seeing whichever group gets to him first is not fully explained.    We also have some easily checked factual errors, such as describing the rank of the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency as a \\"major\\" (when lieutenant general - 3 stars - is actually the case). The same major wearing a khaki uniform, which went out several decades ago, etc.    An entertaining enough way to pass the time and learn a few phrase of Italian in the bargain tho, if you are so inclined.    Buono appetit!
B000ZLFALS|2.0|I must admit that I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than I thought I would, but the second half was like Moulin Rouge all over again. It just went crazy on me. The songs weren't sung or performed that well and left me wishing to hear the original versions instead. The plot also didn't seem to have much purpose other than a thrown together love story mixed with a little anti-war for good measure. Across the Universe seems to be a movie that most people love or hate. I didn't hate it (the visuals were nice), but I wouldn't want to sit through it again.

B0010ZR160|5.0|The film is excellent. It explores several of the current social problems  affecting people. Altho the setting is in Boston, Mass, U.S.A, the problems could be anywhere in most developed countries.   The commentary is particulary useful as you can better understand the  particular place (Boston area) and the special people who happen to live  in that place and why the producers chose to use that setting, which does  give a unique view. The DVD also provides the ability to see the film  again with a running commentary about which scenes were omitted...which  included. We haven't seen this one again but we plan to do so soon.    The acting was first rate as were the production values. It's a film  worth seeing again..particularly with a commentary.

B00005NB8K|2.0|The Doors suffers the same problems that Stone's other films about real people and events (JFK and Nixon) do; Stone uses the docu-drama format as a license to condense times and events, while simultaneously inventing composite characters and situations that never existed. All too often, these films, while containing exciting filmic and visual elements, ring a bit hollow.    The upside of The Doors is the performance of Val Kilmer, who threw himself into the role with ferocity and conviction; that he comes up short in the end isn't due to his acting abilities as much as the choice of episodes and Morrison's characteristics (both real and invented) that Stone chose to film. Simply put, Stone's Morrison comes across as little more than a sporatically gifted poet who sublimates his poetic callings to all the cliched rock star trappings. Perhaps this does describe some of Morrison's personality to a degree, but after seeing Morrison get stoned, drunk and act like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum for 2 hours plus, one wonders if Oliver thought of Morrison as basically an obnoxious drunk (possessed by the soul of a bald, silly-looking, half-naked dead indian that continually wanders around the movie) and, if so, what it was that turned Stone onto making the film in the first place...    The downside, in addition to the lack of scope regarding Morrison, comes in the numerous episodes that never happened (The Doors tripping on acid in the desert, Patricia Kennealy being present at the New Haven show Morrison got arrested at, Particia Kennealy and Pam Courson having a catfight, Buick actually making a commercial using the song Light My Fire and Jim finding out about it by watching tv, Jim setting fire to his and Pam's house while Pam was smacked up in the closet...and on and on). Also, the years of 1967 to early 1969 take up about an hour and a half of the movie, while the remainder of 1969 through to mid 1971 take about twenty minutes.    It's a shame that Stone went to such trouble to set up and film some great concert sequences, and Kilmer really made a terrific attempt at playing Morrison, but in the end both were content to rest the character on both the various myths about the singer and the confirmed instances of Morrison at his drunken worst. A well-shot film that, in the end, has little to do with reality.

B000KRNG5E|1.0|After making his two masterpieces, \\"Deep Red\\" and \\"Suspiria\\", it seemed inevitable that Dario Argento's next film would disappoint. However, \\"Inferno\\" is not just disappointing, it is downright bad.    The second film in the \\"Three Mothers\\" trilogy (the first being \\"Suspiria\\" and the third being the recently released \\"The Mother of Tears\\") is about a young woman who thinks that her New York apartment building happens to house one of three witches, the Mother of Darkness. That's it. The plot really doesn't progress much beyond that. I'd like to say that much investigation and suspense follows, but it doesn't. Sure there's a string of gory murders and the young woman's brother shows up in New York, but these scenes are all rather random and don't really form a coherent storyline.     As with all Dario Argento films, the acting is atrocious. However, because \\"Inferno\\" lacks the coherance of \\"Deep Red\\" and the stylish beauty of \\"Suspiria\\", this is all the more apparent. At times I felt like I was watching a bad t.v. movie, not a film by one of the greatest horror directors of all time. Apparently, 20th Century Fox shelved this film for five years, before releasing it straight-to-video. I'm not surprised. This is, by far, the worst of all of the Dario Argento films that I have seen to date.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This movie while not as long as the other version was much better done. This movie has actors that actually look like they are in their late 20's as opposed to early 40's. The have good on screen chemistry and the movie moves along at a good pace. Parts of the book are not all here as this is a shorter movie, but this one is much easier to follow. Well done Master Piece Theater.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I thought this was going to be something akin to the FOG, with some whacked out dead people killing normal people. Turns out this was a wonderfull spooky thriller that maybe youve seen done in many ways before, but the director did a marvelous job in building up to all the fright and shock of the hapless victims stuck in the market and played so low key by the actors that their was no ham or cheese in site.    For a over 2 hour movie it was a great rollercoaster ride. Time actually went by faster then I could believe. Rent or buy just watch it.      Any Halflife Fans get a bit of deja vu when the big baddie showed up?? Wheres Gordon Freeman when you need him.
B000O5AYCA|3.0|I boght this cd Because Paste magazine named album of year for 2007, needless to say it was greatly over-hyped. Its a good album, at times personally I felt that the music overall was bland and nothing was there to shake me awake and make the album stand out, but there are a few exceptions.
B000002MIF|5.0|Released in 1984, between the Smiths' self-titled debut and their second proper studio album (Meat Is Murder), Hatful Of Hollow is a sort of compilation, focusing on non-LP tracks recorded by the group in the earliest portion of their career. The album features two singles (\\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" and \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\") that were released in '84 but didn't appear on the debut. Also on board are their accompanying B-Sides (\\"Girl Afraid\\" for the former, \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" and \\"How Soon Is Now\\" for the latter). The other featured studio track is the original single single version of \\"Hand In Glove,\\" which is noticeably different to the more well-known album mix. The rest of the album is composed of live-in-the-studio recordings that the group made in 1983 for BBC radio.<br /><br />Although it's a mere compilation, Hatful is often seen as one of the Smiths' finest records. Some fans even put it at the very top of their canon. This sort of thinking is understandable, since this album is one of the few places where listeners can experience the band's phenomenal power as a live act. The radio recordings are nervy and raw, allowing the group's emotional drive and sense of pop song-craft to shine through with blistering immediacy. On songs such as \\"What DIfference Does It Make\\" and \\"These Things Take Time,\\" the music reaches a level of intensity that puts their studio counterparts to shame. Same goes for the annoyingly rare (and undeniably brilliant) \\"Handsome Devil,\\" and the sullen roar of \\"You've Got Everything Now.\\" \\"This Charming Man\\" isn't the flawless pop gem that its studio counterpart was, but it's still full of gorgeous, hypnotic urgency and yearning vocals.<br /><br />The studio recordings are also fantastic- \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" is one of the group's very best singles, a wistful slice of emotive (and quietly sarcastic) self-pity, with a beautiful guitar line and majestic vocal arcs. \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\" is a dark, shiny burst of 80s decadence. \\"How Is Now\\" is, deservedly, one of the group's best-known songs. It's an epic, apocalyptic anthem for shut-ins, outcasts, and loners the world over. \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" is painfully short and achingly sweet, while \\"Girl Afraid\\" features a really cool guitar part.<br /><br />All in all, Hatful Of Hollow is an undeniable classic. The only real misfire is the awful version of \\"Hand In Glove.\\" The song itself is brilliant, of course, but the bass-heavy mix and badly treated vocals taint the song beyond belief. Thankfully, there are plenty of places to get the vastly superior album version. Get this record for the other fifteen tracks.
B000Y2WAL6|5.0|It's amazing to me as I listen through the Eels large catalog, that most people consider them a one hit wonder band. All of their works have a great range of sound and in depth lyrics that get you lost in E's at times bizarre voice. The B-sides collection is no exception to this. More often than not I buy these listen to them once and they get lost in my cd collection (b-side collections), the  Eels collection is an exception to this though. Both the reintepretations of their own and others songs make this a vital part of anyones cd collection.
B0010358D0|4.0|Appleseed Ex Machina is a sequel to 2004's Appleseed; produced by John Woo and directed by Shinji Aramaki, the duo comes with an entertaining futuristic thriller adapted from the manga by Shirow Masamune (Ghost in the Shell). The revolutionary CGI animation is astonishing, combined with awesome action sequences reminiscent of John Woo movies, Appleseed Ex Machina looks very promising. Thankfully, you do not need to see the 2004 film to appreciate and comprehend this new film's premise. The plot itself lacks depth, it is so predictable that everything is laid out for the viewer; this animated feature is more about CGI and action than anything else. It definitely feels to be geared to international audiences than to Shirow's native land.<br /><br />The year is 2133, civilization is recovering from the global war that almost devastated the world. Utopian cities are on the rise, technological advancements are dominating the world and humans have a fresh new attitude to match their new surroundings. Cyborgs are very common, machine parts are used to replace severed limbs and body parts. Bioroids are being cloned from humans to use as soldiers that lack human emotion and violent tendencies that often get humanity in trouble. Quoted as \\" incapable of hate and anger, will only fight and kill when absolutely necessary...\\" or are they? The passive bioroids are intended to keep order so that the world can maintain the peace without the hostile influences of hatred and rage.<br />Special forces specialist Deunan and Briareos are partners from the days that Briareos was human. Briareos is a special case, since he is the only human being who managed to survive being 100% cyborg without going insane. When Briareos was injured (or damaged), he becomes replaced by Tereus, a bioroid cloned from his human DNA.<br />When an unknown enemy plans a stealth attack by reducing common folk into technological zombies who turn the city into a war zone, the trio must settle their differences to quell this threat.<br /><br />Appleseed isn't as bad as I first thought it would be. Renowned action scribe John Woo definitely showed his hand with most (not all) of the action sequences. The action is visually stylish and definitely looks cool. Woo's usual gimmicks are omnipresent in the proceedings; bike stunts, stylish bullet ballet and helter skelter action sequences are what's in store for the viewer. \\"Ex machina\\" also has the same mecha action in its previous installment. The film definitely feels like it is geared towards an specific audience and therefore lost some of the atmosphere and depth that contemporary sci-fi anime has been known for. \\"Ex Machina\\" is about the action, it is a straightforward film with one-dimensional antagonists with motivations completely predictable and something that has been  done through the years.<br /><br />The emotional aspect of Deunan and Briareos' relationship is quite interesting and serves as the film's main premise. Despite the fact that Deunan has kept her humanity and Briareos has lost 85% of his body, their commitment and love for each other remains strong. However, their relationship is thrown into a loop when Tereus gets into the mix, since he is a clone from Briareos human DNA. Yes, there is a bit of a sappy love triangle here that has the same elements that we've all seen before.<br /><br />The animation is quite good. The film sidesteps the usual anime style and effectively combines modern and contemporary anime. The backdrops are astounding and definitely catches the architecture of the future. The characters look almost photorealistic without the usual \\"over expressive, super fair complexioned characters. Deunan is rendered to look like a lethal but sexy woman, with the designer, Prada taking a hand in one of her outfits. The graphics are definitely an improvement over the 2004 film, but still falls short to the quality of \\"Final Fantasy Advent Children\\" and \\"Biohazard:Degeneration\\".<br /><br />Appleseed ExMachina is overall a success I suppose. Fans of the 2004 film will definitely appreciate this sequel and newer fans will be impressed. I'm not saying that this film should be your first experience with anime, there are definitely more worthy titles than this film. This film is more about entertainment and not the usual philosophical and existential fare that contemporary Japanese Anime has been famous for. It fell into the usual plot holes and predictability that is so reminiscent of animated films geared for a younger audience. It is a popcorn movie more than anything else. APPLESEED Ex MACHINA is good but NOT essential.<br />Recommended timidly, rent it first.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I almost never buy movies.  I bought this one.  It is creative with wonderful choreography that doesn't look like \\"musical dancing\\".  This is telling a story with one's whole being - and the impact is profound.  I dreamed deeply because of this movie - and not just when I was sleeping.    On another level - these were some of the best treatments of Beatles songs I've heard in a long time.    Thanks for making the movie.

B0013FSVES|4.0|The acclaimed Renata Scotto made a local debut as Violetta at the age of 18 in 1952, and she maintained La Traviata as a specialty throughout the rising arc of her career. I've heard three recordings on CD that capture her in various stages of vocal and dramatic achievement, and I thought it would be interesting to offer comparative comments:<br /><br />1962 (DG) -- Here is Scotto in freshest voice, but even at this early stage her voice had \\"as much needle as thread in it,\\" to quote a comment once made about a similar soprano, Beverly Sills. Both recorded exciting but vocally impure Violettas. In this case, the slack rhythms and lagging pace set by Antionio Votto on the podium ruin the entire performance for me, and nobody in the cast except Scotto is of much note.  Also, Scotto's unique dramatic daring hadn't emerged yet. If this is her most beautiful Violetta, it's also her tamest.<br /><br />1973 (Opera d'Oro) -- This off-air recording suffers from a good deal of mircophone shatter when the singers hit high notes, which is especially unflattering to Scotto's already edgy timbre. But she and her Alfredo, the young, charismatic Jose Carreras, throw off sparks, and the combinaiton is fiery and exciting. On the podium Nino Verchi, conducting before a Tokyo audience, is better than Votto but not much.  Overall, however, I'd rate this a very successful reading if you don't mind the occasional aural irritation. And the bargain price doesn't hurt.<br /><br />1980 (EMI)  -- Although billed in this remastering as a 'Great Recording of the Century,' this studio product under Riccardo Muti finds Scotto and her Alfredo, the middle-aged Alfredo Kraus, in less than youthful voice (he had been Callas's tenor in her fabled Lisbon Traviata almost thirty years before). But in both cases the vocal deficiency is minimal, and in return we get Kraus's superbly stylish singing -- this is one of his prime roles -- and Scotto's intense dramatic instincts, which were second only to Callas's.<br />  We also get a smooth, assured if aloof Germont from Renato Bruson (not a favorite of mine), and Muti is less hard and driven than his wont. He's a titan compared to his two previous rivals. The pace is generally fast, as with Carlos Klieber on DG, and Muti gets disciplined playing from the Philharmonia. Critics originally complained about somewhat cavernous sound, but I found it intrusive only in the big scenes with chorus. Otherwise, the leading voices are caught quite naturally.<br /><br />In the end, this EMI set has the most pluses and fewest minuses. Only those listeners who can't abide Scotto's squawky high notes and the wobble in her voice under pressure should stay away. In the immense catalog of recorded Traviatas, this one deserves an honored place.smooth, assured if aloof Germont from Renato Bruson (not a favorite of mine), and Muti is less hard and driven than his wont.

B000MRAAJW|4.0|This is a well done documentary that will be a great learning tool for my young son.  It's a great overview of the world around us and I expect it to get quite a few runs in the HD-DVD player.

0718152433|5.0|I just happened upon this book at the local grocery store but didn't hesitate to purchase it as I've always enjoyed Jamie Oliver's cookbooks. His writing has always been down to earth and he seems to 'relish' (pun intended!) any opportunity to educate the public about making healthy, delicious eating practical and realistic. He's forever 'encouraging' us to eat responsibly...with a healthy dose of common sense and absolute sincere appreciation for where our food comes from and in which form it takes on our plates. His humour and generous spirit shine through, as always.  As a gardener I especially appreciated the way he's chosen to write a very simple book that includes information on growing your own food, making ethical (without being too preachy!) food choices and most of all...simply and truly enjoying quality, delicious REAL food.  Good job, Jamie!
0312379293|4.0|Some reviews have compared it to 'Kane and Abel', one of his first novels - however although I have read a few of Archer's other books, I've not read that particular one so couldn't compare it. I just enjoyed the book for what it was - a well told story that maybe could be argued was slightly far-fetched at times...but it wasn't far-fetched enough to make me want to put it down.<br /><br />The characters are either 'goodies' who are loyal, honest and likable or 'baddies' (I almost wanted to boo when they made an appearance!) who are cheats and liars.<br /><br />A plot that is cleverly thought out and forces you to \\"just read one more page\\" until you realise you've read another 30!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Better than me, better than you. They are just an Uber-talented band with savvy to boot.    I was fortunate enough to see Muse perform on Friday evening (21 March) and was completely blown away! In fact the very next day I went off to the nearest CD store and purchased this and Absolution as a result. To say the performance was mind-blowing is an understatement. But let me not digress too far.    The songs on the album are completely eclectic, from synth-pop to surf-like guitar tones (the first part of Knights of Cydonia reminds of a futuristic version of the Shadows) but at the same time the album never becomes too daunting to listen to. Every second of listening to the album I just keep thinking \\"What are they going to do next?\\"    As for fave tracks Knights of Cydonia is my favourite currently (this may of course change as I listen more and more to the album) but I also totally love Supermassive Black Hole and Starlight. (I am going to assume that these songs will likely be most peoples' favourites because they really stand out from the first time you listen to them!) I also think that Take a Bow is very cool, and is the most fitting album opener.    In short it seems as though Muse have managed to progress from where Radiohead started in alternative music and have come up with an incredibly intelligent, musical, quirky [insert as many adjectives as you like] offering that is destined to be a classic. All this and they have managed to avoid the categorisation as a \\"prog\\" band!    Go and buy this CD now, and fill the Supermassive Black Hole in your CD collection!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Another well thought out action/thriller film from 'Antoine Fuqua'(Training Day). This film will keep you interested for it's 2 hour running length. One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras.
B000RJO578|2.0|\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is fricking HILARIOUS, but \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is mildly amusing at best.<br /><br />After a promising start, say the first 20 mins or so, the film drags on for another hour eliciting few chuckles.

0374280967|5.0|Mr. Bennett has a history of writing about topics in a way that makes them seem far fetched and realistic all at the same time. \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" is no exception. By making his protagonist the Queen of England he elevates the life altering power and influence of reading and writing to its highest possible level in the human social realm. As you read this text you loose sight of the fact that this is a monarch because you find yourself nodding along in agreement with the Queen's observations and discoveries. Understanding how literature and the act of reading and writing helps create us as humans is a discovery that all intellectually curious people make and its effect is dramatic and profound regardless of one's social status. The way in which Mr. Bennett ends his novella (I won't spoil it here) is one that resonates after you have put this text aside. The longer I thought about it I realized that its ending is true to life. All of us, regardless of our wealth or social level, change profoundly once we have discovered the power of humanity that reading and writing liberates in us.<br />A perfect choice for book clubs or students of literature, although anyone who appreciates the power of books to unlock the mind will enjoy this poignant and comic text. As the Queen writes in the novella, \\"You don't put your life into your books. You find it there.\\"

0340898917|5.0|This book is an inspirational compilation of insightful spiritual truths.     Tolle is without doubt a leading author of evolving spirituality in the world today - and his secret ? - an honest and loving approach to explaining what he has drawn from study and genuine personal experience. Encouraging us all to seek something better in ourselves, you begin to feel the truth of his words as they touch something deep inside you, drawing you deeper into consciousness.      In the years to come we may well look upon this book as a clear indicator to the potential of the human being. The more people that read and awaken to this sort of material, the sooner we will be a able to develop a better world society that will naturally have love, compassion, truth, peace and harmony at it's heart.    If you're looking for the next book that could powerfully impact your life, then I strongly recommend you read this along with \\"A New Earth\\". Having read The Secret, the 'Abraham' material, ACIM etc it is works like this and 'We Are All One' [[ASIN:1419674056 We Are All One: A call to spiritual uprising]] that could help move the mass consciousness of the world - to evolve us all into something beautiful - living fully meaningful lives. These books have that potential because they unite the human experience and reveal more of what we all truly are - spiritual beings.

0452289963|1.0|I really wanted to like this book after seeing how much it meant to Oprah.  I also had planned on joining the classes online that Oprah is sponsoring.  But once I actually bought the book and started reading it, I was overtaken by the thought of \\"what is all the fuss about?\\"  It's the same stuff we talked about in our Philosophy classes and Psychology classes.  I'm really surprised that Oprah has latched onto this as much as she has.  At the end of the day, I think people will come to the conclusion that we need more than just thinking positive thoughts and talking ourselves into happiness.      Oprah has said she doesn't profess her Christian beliefs very much because there are people in the world who don't know Christ.  My question is this:  if she's so willing to promote Tolle's book around the world and have world-wide \\"classes\\" about it, why isn't she doing this with the Bible?  Why not take the opportunity to let people know around the world about Christ?  The true lessons about the earth and happiness can be found in the Bible.    I found Tolle's book to be an interesting read, but it's certainly not the earth-shattering book that it's held out to be.

0307277887|1.0|This is perhaps a two star book, rather than a one star book, but I was so disappointed and let-down that I just couldn't give it two.  The premise is awesome.  A serial killer who stalks other serial killers, and you get a look at how he thinks?  Wow!  Great!  Only this book falls far short of any excitement.      The characters are all so overly-written and stereotypical that I wanted to slap each one, every time they showed up.    - the sister has a cuss word every sentence (note, I'm not squeamish about this sort of thing, and admittedly my language is pretty bad, but it gets old really, really fast), is oh so pretty, and of course stupid.    - The lead detective is beyond stupid and got to where she is because she's so pretty, and such a good butt-kisser and it's all politics, to bad she can't see a plank until she's walked into it.  We get treated to long monologues about how stupid she is every time we see her.  To bad no one else is any smarter, including Dexter.  Sorry author, you don't make your character smarter by dumbing everyone else down.     Dexter would go on lovely pointless monologues about how everyone was so stupid (by the way, if you're in Florida and you have a crime committed against you, don't expect it to be resolved, apparently the police there are for looks only.).  Meanwhile I'm gritting my teeth as he mulls it over because it's so obvious a 3 year old could figure out each and every step.  Dexter is apparently the only one with at least the intellect of a three year old by the way.  Isn't he brilliant?  Blech.  Which leads me to the next let down:  Dexter.  So he kills people, and gets all weepy and romantic and poet-y about it.  He feels no emotion.  He doesn't get women.  Then, next thing you know he understand his sister must be upset.  He doesn't feel emotions, but he likes his sister, cares for her happiness.  The point of being a sociopath is that you pretty much fake everything.  You can't like people.  You don't like children.You go through life doing what it takes to fit in, faking it.  We keep hearing how Dexter's faking it, and then suddenly he's not, he's doing something out of character: feeling bad for his sister, kissing his girlfriend.  If I wanted a man with a little trouble fitting in there are tons of books on the shelf.  I wanted a sociopathic killer.  Not some dude with a rather un-original voice in his head(who by the way, is said to not talk during some random flashback - don't get me started on long, rambling, heart-wreching-(not)-gag-me backstories).    My final disappointment: the mystery.  As I said, no ones to bright.  Shocking that no one notices the killer wasn't interrupted enough to not wrap the limbs!  Shocking that no once can come up with any symbolism for the rear view mirror.  And brilliant Dexter, nothing for miles but a gas station, the guys vanished, hmm, lets not check behind the gas station.  And our taunting rival sociopath is all about being clean and keeping everything wrapped and piled up, but he throws a head at Dexter?  It would have been really climactic, but I was busy wondering if this was some other guy or else why would this guy be breaking his M.O.?  Oh, because the author thinks it'll be cool.  Got it.  When I've already got it figured out, I don't want to listen to the main character wax poetic about how there must be some meaning, oh right, he's so brilliant, it only took him ages worth of deep exploration to figure it out (remember, everyone else is stupid and doesn't stand a chance!  They need Dexter to point out everything to them and everyone loves him even though even he admits he's a kiss-butt)    Admittedly, I did not read the book, rather listed to it on audiobook on a long car ride, maybe if I'd been able to put it down and go to something else I would have been able to make it through.  Stopped just short of the end, my blood pressure was going up with every moment of pointless dribble.  Maybe still, if I had been able to skip tothe end of long paragraphs about how stupid people were, how brilliant he was, how he didn't know what emotion was, repeat 6 or 7 times per hour, I would have been fine.  I doubt it.  I'm not hard to please when I'm driving 8 hours alone.  Most entertainment will suffice.  Darkly Dreaming Dexter fell well short of \\"entertainment\\".
B000VWYNNW|3.0|First, I want to say that the ORIGINAL version of this album is one of my favorite albums of all time! On the original release, the live versions of Song Remains the Same, Rain Song, Celebration Day and No Quarter are far superior to the studio versions in my opinion.    HOWEVER, this release is not just a remastered version with 6 new songs. Listening to this release frustrates me because I hear so many edits on what were really great versions on the original. I would just like to ask Jimmy Page WHY!!!!! Sure add new songs and improve the sound quality but why edit versions that have been part of this album for 31 years!!!    I know people who are new to this album won't care that much about the edits but for Diehards like me, it's a slap in the face!  Just a few examples of horrible edits that differ from the original release:    Celebration Day - The outro solo is different and inferior.    No Quarter - The piano solo that starts at 3:27, Page cut out a minute of that very cool groove before the guitar solo starts and THEN he edited the guitar solo which on the original version was one of my favorites of all time.  WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And then he cut John Paul Jones introduction after the song (He does like to disrespect Jonesy).    Whole Lotta Love - On the original version at 1:22 a very cool funky jam happens for about a minute and 40 seconds.  On this release Page cut out a minute and half of that jam.  It didn't improve anything it sounds awkward and edited.      There are other small edits not worth ranting about but I hear them everytime I listen to this release.    Now for the positive.  Yes the sound and packaging are far superior to the original and yes it's great having new tracks:    The Ocean, Heartbreaker, Since I've Been Loving You - All great performances and sound great.    Misty Mountain Hop and Over the Hills and Far Away - Good performances and sound great.    Black Dog - I would have left this one off because it becomes a trainwreck at the end.  For me, they never pulled this song off live.    I was very excited when I heard that this album was going to be remastered and expanded but I have to say I am disappionted and I will probably keep listening to the original version I own.    Do yourself a favor and buy a used copy of the original release. It won't sound as full but the versions are better.

B000051ZST|5.0|French toast, anyone?  I wasn't expecting much when I pulled this from the bargain bin, and later threw it on the dvd player as I was packing some stuff.  Pretty soon though I found it hard not to pay attention. After a few of the gut busting laughs this movie put me through, I was pretty much along for the ride with Road Trip!  Something like American Pie in it's humor..  Really, there are too many scenes that are just hilarious - it's not high art - it's just good ole fashioned coarse teen humor - some really funny #*&$! in this movie.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Awesome adaptation of the Beatles music. This film has a raw feeling that could go anywhere. Terrific talented new actors. Definately some tremendous performances with great direction. A winner for me.
B001041JKU|1.0|Dear lord, how many repackaged sets of Jackson can the public want? I've lost count. They're certainly desperate to get every last cent out of a ruinous deal they made with a mutilated freak like Jackson. After listening to the laughable remixes I can only hope someone thinks them better than barely passable. I also hope that number is in the low single digits.     The original record is one of the greatest jobs of production ever and Quincy Jones has to take a bow for ridding most of the excesses of Jackson. The musical credits are a lie as Eddie Van Halen only plays a few bars of \\"Beat It\\" and the rest is a studio musician.     The best songs on here are written by others, the horrid material by Jackson recalls some of the worst McCartney lyrics. The difference is that McCartney writes the words after the music and it works. Since Jackson has no musical talent (he's credited with hand clapping on several songs - <giggle!>) the music is forced to fit the words and ghastly things happen on Thriller, even with Quincy to patch it up.     If Quincy were dead, hearing the remixes would have him doing 60,000 RPM and I'm not sure any casket would hold up. Here's hoping he'll opt for cremation if anyone foolishly plays these remixed songs a year or more from now.     In short, don't encourage anyone to put out yet another repackaging of a sick human being like Jackson. What's next, a Gary Glitter box set on Blu-Ray?
B000WQW988|5.0|A wonderful DVD with crystal clear transfers...the  extras also great.  A must for any fan...    Enjoy!!
8489367116|5.0|Both my husband and I each have our own copy. We read it together whenever we could. Every review I have read on this website is correct; even the representative quote from one gentleman. It is a must for every person who does actually think and feel-to seek more than their known possibilities. This author is magnificent in a fullness that isn't familiar. It is art in that the words perform beautifully to produce an inner landscape that I have never imagined before. Dreadful and delightful; full sensory descriptions that bore me not once and I'm a slow reader.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Author Neil Gaiman has called his fantasy, \\"Stardust\\", \\"a modern-day fairy tale\\", but director Matthew Vaughn has accomplished far more, in this wonderful adaptation; he has created a \\"Princess Bride\\"-style gem, with warmth and a quirky sense of humor, deliciously served up by a first-rate cast.<br /><br />The storyline is a refreshing change from the recent spate of epic-sized \\"Lord of the Rings\\" wannabes; eighteen years after a dalliance between a man from our realm, and a princess from the world of Faerie, their geeky son (Ben Barnes) returns to the enchanted realm to recover a falling star, to win the heart of the cutest girl in school. He discovers that stars are actually magical creatures ('his' is a remarkably low-key Claire Danes), and that an evil witch (the still-stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) and the unscrupulous heirs of the dying King of the realm (Peter O'Toole) are also after the star, for vastly different reasons!<br /><br />Much as with \\"The Princess Bride\\", the film maintains a tongue-in-cheek irreverence, particularly with the introduction of Robert De Niro as a likable 'in the closet' gay sky pirate (certainly his most off-beat role since he played 'Fearless Leader' in \\"Rocky and Bullwinkle\\"). As Barnes and Danes attempt to elude their murderous pursuers, they find romance, and discover the best magic comes from the heart (both figuratively AND literally).<br /><br />Whimsical, without sacrificing a sense of wonder, \\"Stardust\\" works brilliantly at all levels, and this is one enchanted tale you WON'T want to miss!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|or those that can't stand the sight of blood because it is in abundance in this show.  Along with Dexter (a guy with more skeletons in his closet than a graveyard) and his repressed memories of a violent tragic indicent early in his life.  As the season builds we get to see glimpses of it with more and more being revealed until.  It builds up with a face to face confrontation with the Ice Truck Killer (a few surprises) abound in the first season finale and it leaves things wide open.  For the series and all of its characters.<br /><br />I believe that Season 2 will continue to impress and draw in new folks in the process.  Excellent story, lead and supporting characters and backgrounds leaves you with the first season of Dexter.  An up and coming show that gives those established shows a serious run for their money.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 1 of Dexter blew my mind and made me rethink what makes a television show worth watching, but it isn't until season 2 that this show really became my favorite of all time. Every episode is worth watching at least three or four times!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I have liked this movie since it came out!  My 7 year old was interested in a period piece and this movie is a good fit.  It has Da Vinci, and although fiction, explores slavery, status, etc.  It contains no inappropriate language or sex.  He really enjoyed it!  Great family movie!  Recommend!
B0013FBS20|4.0|I saw the Charlton Heston movie and it colors my perspective. That's a problem with remakes. So, I'll give you a film critique. You have all of the available pieces of the Aristotelean model: Sympathetic character, the setting, antagonist, the inciting incident, the potential to win and something to take away in a tragedy. The special effects are decent, the acting by Will Smith? As always, Smith gives is one of the world's finest actors and I don't know how this guy brings it every time especially here.<br /><br />I liked it and I have a bias. It's one that kept me wide awake.
B000E1MTXQ|4.0|Second installment continues the story line. The characters are complex, and very interesting. The HD DVD quality is not good because of the technology used at the time of filming. However it is better than standard definition and worth the investment if you do not have standard DVD version in your collection.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|A movie or television show is really only as good as what the writer(s) create. While the visual sets and special effects were awesome on this film, the storyline was so bad that I felt sorry for the actors in the film. An excellent cast, great director and even better special effects were all wasted because the writing itself was so stupid. You're almost better off reading the original stories themselves and avoiding this dumb film.
6305558175|4.0|\\"Sommersby\\" is both about the cyclical nature of the universe, where matter can be neither created nor destroyed, only changed in state, and a demonstration of that law.\\" Vincent Canby<br /><br />I loved this film, hated the ending.  A southern man comes home from the Civil War and re-enters his life as Jack Sommersby. His wife, thinking he was indeed dead after 6 six years has promised herself to another. Nothing is as it was, and it never will be again. The old Southern plantation has been looted, and there is not much left but the body and souls who inhabit the place. It appears that Jack Sommersby was not the kind of man one really liked unless you were into brutality, drunkenness and slavery. But this new Jack Sommersby is a changed man, \\"Got hit in my head\\" he says. The neighbors and the man who was to marry his wife think something is not quite right here. But Jack Sommersby offers his family and his neighbors something they have not seen nor heard in a long time, hope. Hope of making a living and living off the land. Jack Sommersby has wormed his way into their hearts, and they love them. He has also offered his black slaves their own land, and this does not go over well with some. Visions of the KKK. But this new Jack Sommersby is not what he seems, and a trial and the courtroom soon reveal what has been and what is to come.<br /><br />Jodie Foster, as Laurel Sommersby, is forever more my idol-you know that with a smile or the flick of her eyes what emotion she is feeling. She is the epitome of a southern lady waiting to be undone. After two Academy Awards this may be one of her best performances. However, it is Richard Gere who steals the scenes in my opinion. This is, indeed his best performance, and he is believable as a man who wants to be someone he can be proud of. Bill Pullman who plays the man who wants Laurel's heart is a duplicitous man who will do or say anything to win Laurel back.<br /><br />And what about the dog, Jethro?<br /><br />Peter Travers has the best lines in his critique of the film,<br />\\"Of special pertinence right now is the new light the film sheds on marriage and the doubts it engenders.

192076920X|5.0|I read Shantaram about a year ago.  While this book has perhaps the flaw of overflowing writing (only at times, and it's beautiful writing that goes on a bit too long--perhaps the reflection of a strong-headed author or an over indulgent editor)--this is most definitely one of the top 10 books I've read in my 50 years of avid reading.    Remember, this is a first novel from an author.  But you won't remember the flaws, unless you're obsessive-compulsive.  You will be drawn into the story, want to escape into the characters, revel in the potential of the author's gift of story-telling.  This isn't low as Grisham (no offense to him), or even *close* to a Danielle Steele (I don't know where that reviewer comes from w/that reference).    You will come away from the novel with a question about justice and punishment, about why drugs are illegal in the world and the pain and suffering that comes with US intervention in other affairs....while I was for the intervention in Afghanistan, I'm against what we're doing in Iraq (the latter of which has nothing to do with the book).    However, as someone who has read numerous non-fiction books of the goings on in Afghanistan, I can tell you that the relevant parts of the book on this are most believable.  Is it fiction?  Who can say.  It *IS* an epic book, and if you read the negative reviews here (the few of them) and decide to *not* read this book, I feel for you.  You will come back in 10 years and read it and wish you had read it sooner.    It's that good.

0141439807|5.0|Jane Austen finished \\"Mansfield Park\\" in 1813, after \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  It is a more complex novel than either of its precedessors or its successors (\\"Emma\\", \\"Persuasion\\", and \\"Northanger Abbey\\").  Its heroine, Fanny Price, is rather the middle child in Austen's sisterhood, often overlooked when compared to her more attractive older sisters or more interesting younger sisters.  Still, Fanny Price is worth getting to know.<br /><br />One of a growing brood of children in a lower middle class family in Portsmouth, Fanny is placed for raising with her much wealthier Aunt and Uncle Bertram at Mansfield Park in the English countryside.  The ten year-old Fanny is painfully shy, physically sickly, and less educated than her Bertram cousins, who mostly ignore or make subtle fun of her.  Her Aunt Norris, responsible for the day-to-day raising of her cousins, thrives on tormenting Fanny.  Only her cousin Edmund takes an interest in her.  Under his guidance, she begins to catch up to her cousins as she matures into an attractive young woman.  Most importantly, she fortifies a strong sense of morality.<br /><br />The prolonged absence of Fanny's Uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, to tend to his estates in Antigua, leaves the household under the uncertain leadership of Aunt Norris, just as the wealthy Mary and Henry Crawford arrive from London.  Mary and Henry are the same age as the older Bertram children, but worldly, manipulative, and less grounded in solid values.  Henry flirts shamelessly with Fanny's engaged cousin Maria and trifles with Maria's younger sister Julia, while Mary flaunts her considerable charms at Edmund.  The Bertrams are tempted into inappropriate behavior, which only Fanny resists.<br /><br />Sir Thomas re-imposes order upon his return from the Caribbean.  Maria is married off to a wealthy if rather stupid neighbor.  Edmund courts Mary Crawford, to the distress of Fanny, who has an interes in Edmund and who sees Mary for the shallow manipulator she is.  Fanny herself is courted by Henry Crawford, who starts by trifling with her emotions but comes to seek her as a wife.  Great pressure is placed on Fanny by Sir Thomas, by Edmund, and by Mary to accept Henry as an advantageous match.<br /><br />The anguished Fanny holds her ground, and is effectively exiled to Portsmouth, where she finds little to love in her vulgar birth family except a promising younger sister.  In her absence, the Bertram family falls to pieces in sickness and scandal.  Fanny will be summoned back to Mansfield Park, with a final opportunity for personal happiness.<br /><br />As Tony Tanner's excellent introduction makes clear, Fanny is unique among Austen heroines in her invariably good moral sense.  Her attraction as a character is based less on the personal growth and maturation we expect in a Austen heroine and more on her perseverence in the face of very attractive temptations and seemingly reasonable pressures.  It is Austen's genius to insert complex characters into the subtle relationships between four families in the story.  The story provides a fascinating venue for social commentary and compelling domestic drama.  The witty and enthusiastic but morally flawed Crawfords, for example, seem more attractive than the shy, vulnerable, and withdrawn Fanny or the understated Edmund.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's romances.

B00000J2PH|5.0|I was still listening to my original album and cassette recording of this!  Finally bought the CD.  Love it, a must have classic...
0307388840|1.0|I have picked up many books and put them down without ever reading them through, usually with the thought \\"That's the worst book I've ever had the mis-fortune to try reading\\". With this book, I forced myself to read it though simply because it's supposed to be an award winning novel and so fantastic that they are making a film of it. I hope they have better luck with the film...because when I say I forced myself to read the story, I was thinking when I finished it \\"That's the worst book I've ever had the mis-fortune to read through it's entirety\\".    Don't get me wrong, it had a few events that held you for a page or two, but overall, the story was so wordy that usually by the time you reached the bottom of the page you were forgetting what was going on and having to read it again...
B00005JPTK|3.0|I have two problems with  this movie. One  is the lack of story depth. However, that didn't hamper my overall enjoyment of the very sound acting and good technical aspects of this movie. Will smith was really good and his dialog did not contain any cheesy catch phrases. The three star rating is a solid one. My other problem doesn't have anything to do with the movie. It has to do with the studio jerks at Warner Bros. who thought it was a good idea to provide web access to the main special features only to customers who own a PC. I would never have purchased this disc if I had read the fine print at the back. I think it is simply outrageous. I generally have a problem with web access features but I never encountered a disc the restricts access  to PC users only.  Also you cant put the digital copy on your computer if it is not a PC. The digital copy is one of the main reasons I bought the disc. I think this constitutes marketing fraud because it was not made explicitly clear.  On the front of the box, and even on the Amazon website, it simply says \\"Digital copy included\\" not \\"Digital copy for PCs only included\\". I am so angry about this that I am actually going to do something I have never done before; try and return this disc. So as a warning to everyone who plans to buy this disc, if you own a Mac, don't think you are getting any back-story features of how they created an empty New York, the creating of the cool visual effects or any extra copy of the movie to put on your computer.
B000002U82|5.0|This right here is proof that the Greater Being loves the people of this earth. This record, back in 1973, was the ultimate musical treat, and still, today this record is the ultimate musical treat. First, however, there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said about this album. It already is a well known fact that this is the masterpiece of all music. Let me just tell the people who don't like this album, that they obviously don't know anyhthing at all about music. Alot of the time, you have to be a musician to fully appreciate the genius of this album. For those of you who are confused about the \\"moments of silence\\" in the album, that is what makes the timing, that is what gives it it's atmosphere. One last thing, if you have not heard this, you really have not lived yet.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is a good mix of drama with lightness.  I especially like the two numbers he composed:  \\"Everything\\" and \\"Lost\\".  Great CD.
B000ZN802W|3.0|The movie is very good, with strong performances by all. I really have only 2 issues with it:<br /><br />The first being, why can't Hollywood seem to make a movie about \\"man vs. nature\\" that doesn't end with a tragic death? I hold dear my copy of \\"Jeremiah Johnson\\" as a lone example to the contrary, contrasted with such others as this movie and \\"Grizzly Man\\". Is the message, here, that we should all stay in the cities because we've completely lost all sense of our roots and connection with nature?!?<br /><br />Second, what is the point of attempting to profile a \\"Darwin Award Winner\\" as some kind of heroic figure? This kid, Christopher Johnson McCandless, was stupid, naive, totally unprepared, and incredibly lucky - right up until the end. It would have been more poignant to profile this kid as a \\"healer\\" and focus even more on the changes that his presence created in the lives of others, rather than on his quest to go places that he was totally unprepared for and then watch him inevitably run out of luck.<br /><br />A very good movie, ... if you skip the last 15 minutes, or so!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is, flat out, the best series out there. It's got everything  you could want in a show - action, mystery, horror, drama and the  boys aren't that hard to look at, either. It's amazing how all these  elements are brought together in one production and keeps you glued  to your seat until the final credits roll. But when all is said and  done, no matter how exciting the storyline is, if you don't care for  the main characters, it's all for naught. That said, the 2 main   characters on this series, Dean and Sam Winchester (very ably played   by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, respectively) have a way about   them with their brotherly love and commitment that draws you in and   never lets go. This show presents a relationship that all brothers  out there should have but find hard to achieve. And in the life-  and-death situations they often find themselves in, it's good that  they have each others' back. When your brother is willing to die for  you, you know you have someone you can trust no matter what. For   them, family is everything. But it doesn't hurt to kill as many evil   creatures as they can along the way - give other families a chance   to survive, as well. That's what it's all about.
0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is incredibly written and refreshingly insightful.  It is simple to understand even though the messages are profound.  I wish everyone would read it and read it again.
6305736650|5.0|I dislike reviewing classic movies like this because there are so many other reviews of them that I'm really not adding much. I will say this, this was never one of my favorite films when I was younger but over the years it has grown on me and all things considered it IS a great movie. Especially when you consider its contorted history of casting and re-casting and rewites on top of rewrites of the plot. It's amazing the movie was ever made at all.
B0012QE4QC|1.0|This movie is terrible. The soundtrack music and the ending are the better parts of this farce. The same dialogue spoken in \\"Henry VIII\\" (starring Ray Winstone as Henry VIII) by Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Anne Boleyn was also used by Natalie. Helen is by far the BETTER actress. As a matter of fact, other british actress that played Anne Boleyn in the past are better so there is no comparison. Natalie makes this Anne Boleyn so weak and bitchy and a crybabay that is not funny to watch. She has made a fool of herself by acting in this film. Just because she is Academy Award nominated actress does it now mean that she gets top billing and thinks that she can pull off a british role? HA! Gwyneth Paltrow and Rene Zellweger can do that, but not Natalie.
0930289234|5.0|This is a classic and well worth the price.  Very far ahead of its time, and still a great read.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|The Holiday is a wonderful heart-warming romantic comedy and is right up there with\\" Love Actually\\".  It's a 'feel good' movie.   The stars are wonderful and Jack Black is terrific.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is very reminscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in its heyday.  The dialogue is witty, the plot is intriguing, and the characters are interesting, realistic and fun.  There is a major story arc involving the mystery behind the death of a teenage girl, Lilly Kane, and a mysterious trauma that befalls the heroine and best friend of Lilly, Veronica,  with both events occuring chronologically before the first episode.  Most of the episodes throughout the season revolve around this arc, laying out clues gradually and subtly.  That said, there are also some entertaining, stand-alone episodes that deal with the challenges of being a teenager and the fun that comes along with it.  This show builds suspense very well, doling out plot twists and revelations consistently and up to the season finale.  Characters are complex and sympathetic, with a lot of backstory given to even minor players to enhance the overall story.  The show really illustrates the way that relationships between people can change due to tragedy, and how sometimes the trusted individual is really the villain while the black sheep of the group can come through when the chips are down.
1932100660|4.0|Very good book, and an eye-opener on diet, but does not explain in detail how to execute the diet and is not quite entirely convincing on all points. It is, however, very convincing about reducing dietary animal protein.
B000ZOXDFA|1.0|This movie may rival Ishtar and March or Die as among the worst movies of all time. You will not see much in the movie unless you collect Elizabethan movies or unless you have a part of your portfolio dedicated to the worst movies. This makes The Tudors seem like Shakespeare.<br /><br />The Golden Age is poorly written, badly acted and predictable. It does not deserve to be equated to March or Die.  It is as inane as Ishtar. Blanchett, Rush, etc. play the same predictable roles as in any piece of this genre. It is hackneyed and trite.<br /><br />I am a history moviefile. I love every movie of this genre, but this is often unwatchable. It is formulaic. It would be a waste of time except it is a beautiful film in terms of cinema and costume.  Maybe it would be better as a silent film or if watched in a foreign language.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|A beautifully crafted film filled with vivid, fresh imagery and new arrangements of Beatles songs.  This DVD can be watched over and over again, you'll always see something new.  Lots of down to earth fun in the features disc, meeting the minds behind every aspect of the film.  The entire cast is inspired.  Jim Sturgess is breathtakingly good.
B00122DUNE|5.0|there's no doubt that reissuing yet ANOTHER special edition of Thriller could have been more complete. And the fact the the bonus track Got The Hots is ONLY on the Japanese edition is ridiculous. If the record company wants to really make this a start at a 'comeback' for Michael, then they should start by giving fans what they want. What DO we want? How about this. Include the DVD, but also make this a TWO disc set. Include all the bonus tracks from this edition PLUS the bonus tracks from the previous special edition of Thriller (which are DIFFERENT bonus tracks than these) and FINALLY put the long versions of Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' ON the Thriller album, as Michael originally intended them to be, but was forced to shorten them due to the lack of room on a vinyl LP back in 1982.<br /><br />Anyway, skipping over all the modern remakes--which are mostly the vocals of the new artists, so they aren't so much Michael's songs anymore--the track \\"For All Time\\" is a ballad that sounds very much like Human Nature, which would explain why they both weren't included on the original LP. The reason to buy the Japanese edition is because Got the Hots is the better track. It's a standard Michael/Quincey upbeat R&B groove from the early 80s, but it is much better than For All Time. It isn't, however, in my opinion, up to the standards of the Thriller that it was rejected from years ago. Maybe that's just because of the passage of time and it sounding sort of dated, while the Thriller songs still sound fresh and familiar.
1594489505|5.0|After reading Three Cups of Tea and Beauty School in Kabul, I picked this one up.  This fictional account of the years in Kabul from the 1960s to 2002 seemed more real than the two autobiographical books.  Hosseini, though having left Afghanistan in 1980, presents a picture of two women's lives that felt real and important.  I re learned more about the politics, tribal groups, and sad events that have torn Afghanistan apart here than in regular studies of the land.   Highly recommended.
0143038419|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert was paid a handsome advance to spend several months in Italy, India and Indonesia to find her inner peace.  Early on, I got the feeling that - by buying Eat Pray Love - I contributed to her self-indulgent journey.  Interesting as it was as a travelogue, it never provided an interest in Ms. Gilbert herself.  Did she find God?  Did she find Inner Peace?  Apparently she thought so.  Did she move me to sympathy for her troubles or rejoicing in her progress?  I'm afraid not.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|From the begining to the end this album has a hold on you with Tobias Sammet's haunting voice that takes you back to an old school rock sound. He is a true artist and definately needs to be heard.
B0010V4TZU|3.0|Not too bad for the start of 2008.  These new york kids have a refreshing but not entirely unique sound in today's music scene.  Yes there are hints of the Police, some Talking Heads, some Shins, (Paul Simon is going a bit too far) but overall a nice catchy pop - indie debut cd.  The bells and whistles are the afro-pop influences as well as the string quartet, flute and afro-cuban sounds in the background.  The arrangements and framework of the songs are very similar throughout the cd.  The best tracks are the first 5 tracks. A nice \\"fun\\" debut.  We'll see what happens with their next cd.  This band could become very good or backlashed back to their dorms.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I had a copy of the standard (shorter) version of this CD.  I was thrilled to learn that there was a deluxe version available with all the songs from the movie, each one with beautifully crafted new arrangements.  It's like seeing the movie with your ears.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, the ending SG-1 should've had for the series finale. I hope Stargate Continuum is just as good.
1594489505|5.0|This has to be the most deeply powerful and moving novel I have ever read! I cannot remember being so moved by an historical novel before - the dust and oppressive heat of Kabul, the dinginess of lives trapped in a world where tragedy after tragedy is reality, and the strength of the human spirit to find elusive joy and meaning. And, what an indictment of the religion! The comfort derived from meaningless recitation from the same scriptures of death and hatred that inspired the warlords and the Taliban! Every \\"well-off\\" Westerner should read this book and cry, and every person who loves freedom, religious and other, should read it and quake with fear.
B000W99IK2|5.0|Of all the recordings of the Schubert Symphony No. 8 \\"Unfinished\\" I have listened to over the years (and there have been many), this is the most magical one I have ever heard.  I am not an unquestioning fan of Karajan, but he got it right this time.  The underlying tension,  the melancholy and polished playing by the Berlin Philharmonic: It's all here!  There are other recordings by Karajan of this masterpiece (too bad Franz didn't finish it) but this DG 1965 verson is THE ONE.  I'm happy to see it available again.  It was previously issued on CD coupled with the Mendelssohn Symphony No. 4 \\"Italian\\".  Now it has been remastered and put with the Symphony No. 9 \\"The Great\\" (which makes much more sense).  One of those desert island discs!
0679720200|5.0|This book is a true classic. It is very well written, concise, and accessible. It is a first person narrative of a seemingly ordinary Frenchman  living in Algeria who finds himself involved in a murder. It is amazing and disturbing how easy the reader can be drawn in and caught up in the protagonist's detached view of the world.
0321544080|5.0|Joe McNally is probably the most unassuming guy I have ever seen, and yet he has done so much amazing stuff. If you are interested in the guy behind the lens, if you want to know how he created some amazing shots, if you want to pick up some amazingly handy tips, this is a great book. Just buy it and enjoy it! Unless you can sit down with Joe in person, you should read this book for insight into a really interesting life lived behind the camera.
B0014CDKVY|2.0|I had never seen the other movies or read the book, so I wasn't expecting anything other than usually good Will Smith movie, like Independence Day or Men In Black. They didn't explain enough about why the vaccine for cancer was made and then how it spread the way it did. Too many plot holes and then the \\"rescue at the last moment\\" plot device is just way overdone. Since I bought the 2 DVD Special edition with both endings, I would have to say both endings disappointed me in different ways, either sacrificing himself to save the two others or surrender the girl zombie and save himself. Here is an ending I was expecting: He finds a cure, figures out how to transmit it, and everyone returns to normal, the whole nice happy ending, not a ending that wasn't exactly resolved. Maybe the Hollywood writers' should've stayed on strike, and then the studios would have to get fresh new talent.
B000001DQG|4.0|After Elton, Taupin and company produced what is known as their masterpiece, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, one has to wonder what they would do next. Caribou is the result. It should be put into perspective that Elton was contracted to produce two albums per year at this time. And, with his exhaustive touring schedule, it's to be expected that he'd not be able to keep matching previous successes.     Which brings us to Caribou. This album has gotten a lot of heat over the years and while perhaps the creative energies are showing signs of weakness, he's just not capable of making a complete disaster (aside from 1979's disco Victim of Love, in which he didn't even share songwriting credits).     Can we share a little love for this album? Two main reasons: The Bitch Is Back and Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me - two instant classics. Much has been said about those so I'll move on to the rest of the album.    Caribou is rich with plenty of musical explorations. From one of Elton's finest ballads, Pinky, to the jazzy-dixie Dixie Lilly, there're much to enjoy here. Grimsby, a rocker that incorporates a stinging guitar from Davey Johnstone, rocks with the best of 'em. I've Seen The Saucers tells the tale of UFO sightings (remember, this was 1974 and urban legends were abound in those days of UFO's and Bigfoot - I'm not kidding!).While on Stinker, Elton wraps his most all out blues melody around a lyric perfect for a blues song \\"Say what you will but I'm a stinker/I come crawling up out of my hole/Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose/I'm a perfect curse to pest control.\\"     Meanwhile, the albums closer, Ticking, is one of those incredible moments in the John/Taupin songbook, a basic short story put to minimal music that has social and political overtones that one doesn't necessarily associate with the duo. The tale of a guy who snaps and goes on a killing rampage is sadly, still happening today. But it's Elton's delivery and killer piano that draw the listener in. It doesn't fit the snappy pop influences of the rest of the album but simply reminds everyone that they can take a serious subject and command attention.     The only real misses here are a tango-influenced You're So Static which sounds like a b-side and Solar Prestige A Gammon. On the latter, the boys were getting tired of the over analyzing of Taupin's lyrics and Elton told him to write complete gibberish and he'll put music to it. Sure enough, Taupin did and Elton manages a catchy melody out of words that I'm not sure are even real! But this kind of thing, ego and all, should not have been on a proper album. The reissue of Caribou however contains some bonus tracks including two killer b-sides: Sick City and Cold Highway. It's still a wonder how these two songs didn't make it but Static and Solar did. Other extra tracks include the holiday favorite, Step Into Christmas and Elton's killer version of Pinball Wizard. All nice additions to the overall album.    Elton and Bernie look pretty disinterested on the back cover photo of the album. Their expressions are emotion less as if to apologize for the album. Considering that Captain Fantastic was the next album, we should give them a break. Caribou was a hold over that has some good moments, some great moments and two classics. Not bad and certainly nothing to apologize for fellas.    Best Tracks: The Bitch Is Back, Pinky, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Ticking.

1401322336|5.0|I have several of Jaimies books.....and enjoy them all. This, however, is exceptional. Much of it I am reading like a novel!

B000ENC5YW|5.0|Being a Sean Connery/Catherine Zeta fan I may be a little prejudiced. This is a great movie, fast moving, several fun twists and turns and lots of action. Really kept my attention. I would highly recommend it for action movie fans.

0805079831|4.0|This book provides a useful frame from which to view the actions of the right wing, including the Bush Administration, of the past few decades. It's very well-researched, and offers many useful details on the history of \\"free market\\" economics and torture. It draws a clear line from these origins to their implementations across the world. It does a great job of debunking the idea that \\"capitalism\\" as it is practiced today is actually not the system most people want (nor is authoritarian communism, and the right wing has done a very good job of framing the two systems as an either/or), nor does it actually does not \\"trickle down\\" or \\"help everyone\\"; rather it explodes income inequalities and amplifies misery for the people on the bottom or even close to it. While I think that is easy to see from looking at many countries, including our own, it is useful to be said. After all, history is written by the victors, and those victors have done very well using these principles.     I think Klein gets off course and starts to editorialize a bit too much in places, especially when she discusses Iraq and New Orleans. But this is understandable, these two places offer up the most naked and raw expressions of the ideas, all the ideas, she explained earlier in the book, and the chaos in both places prove she is on to something at the very least. But these sections will also make it much harder to convince those who are, shall we say, \\"center right\\" (far right neocons will never give this book a consideration). And that is unfortunate, as I think this is a valuable book in many ways.
B0013FBS20|3.0|Short review: Is an extremely close remake of THE OMEGA MAN (1970, the second version made from Matheson's novel), with a plot complication/ending stolen directly from M. Night Shyamalan's movie SIGNS.  Rent, or buy cheap.
0805079831|5.0|A profound review of history in my life time.  Should be discussed in college level history courses.  For those few reviewers who dismiss this as just more liberal bias I'd ask how you would interpret the facts that Ms. Klein presents?  So much suffering for greed.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|****NO SPOILERS HERE****    This film is best enjoyed if you know nothing about the plot, and ergo I shall reveal nothing.    I love the comedies of director Frank Oz, from Bowfinger to Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.    But after the dreadful remake of The Stepford Wives, I didn't have high hopes for \\"Death at a Funeral.\\"    But from about the second line in the movie, it is BURST out loud funny. And while it's hard to believe the momentum can be maintained, especially given the morbid theme, the plot surprises continue and the laughs build until the riotous crescendo. Comedies are my favorite genre, and it's difficult to remember a movie funnier than this.    Director Oz apparently benefited by getting out of Hollywood, and working with a no-name cast in the UK, and this is his by far his funniest and best work.    Highly, highly, highly recommended.
0743496736|3.0|With seemingly random violence on the increase, examining where it starts and how to stop it is critical.  This book provided food for thought and discussion, I just wish the characters had been developed better.  With the exception of Peter, they were all pretty weak.  Also, the ending was a bust.  The \\"twist\\" was apparent a long way off.  And the wrap-up of Josie goes to prison, Alex remarries, there's a new baby, and Peter's dead all seemed too tidy.  I don't know if she was just trying to be done with the book after 450 pages or if it was edited poorly, but the conclusion was distracting enough to dismiss the rest of the writing.
0439813786|5.0|I am a 35 tear old female who is getting her Master's degree in library media and read this book because it was discussed so much in my classes.  This is an excellent book.  It's a very fast read becasue of all the pictures, but the pictures add so much to the story...they are the story.  I found myself wanting more and more pictures!  The story line is very good and keeps the reader interested.  Overall, a very unique, interesting book!

B000002WUD|5.0|This five CD box set covers Elvis Presley's 1970s recordings.  The discs are broken up into different categories.  The first two discs cover the a-sides and b-sides of his singles, including UK singles that were not released in the US.  The third and fourth discs include studio recordings that were not released as singles.  The last disc features live recordings, not including live recordings that were released as singles.  Several of these recordings had not been previously released, although some of the songs had been released in different versions.  This is an excellent overview of Elvis Presley's best 1970s recordings.
038572179X|2.0|I bought McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" three days ago because I was in the mood for good leisurely reading, and I had heard excellent reviews on the story. After reading it, I am left stuck between bewildered and intrigued.      Most of my complaints echo those of others and particularly Annika Belcast, a previous reviewer. My main problem with the book is its dull quality. Though I found McEwan's use of different character perspectives and unusual plot twists refreshing and interesting (except in the case of Briony and Emily Tallis), I was overwhelmed with the long, verbose sentences. I forced myself through some chapters and sections.      My last complaint regards the conclusion of the story. The fact that the entire \\"book\\" was Briony's work sent my mind through a loop. Was this a cool new transition, or did it completely erase all sense of resolution? How could the idea of \\"atonement\\" be addressed when, as Briony herself puts it, she is responsible for all perspectives and actions in the story? This aspect of the novel was really disatisfying.     Overall, \\"Atonement\\" scores some points because I did admire some of the literary twists McEwan utilzed. However, the dullness of the story combined with its bizarre twist of events left me feeling bored and bothered.
B00005QHV5|5.0|This is a really wonderful cycle of Beethoven's nine symphonies. I think a prior reviewer got it right when he said the music is \\"alive\\" ... it is indeed. These are strong, vibrant, and exhilarating performances. In fact, this set has become my favorite, and I now don't listen to the others in my collection (Berlin/Karajan), Philharmonia/Zander, Hogwood/Academy of Ancient Music, etc.).    This set is a reissue; I have this set, which is identical:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beethoven-Complete-Symphonies-Ludwig-van/dp/B000025TRV/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1206242668&sr=1-8  which I purchased from Amazon.co.uk for a ridiculously low price (they must have been having a sale). Even with shipping from the UK, I think it cost me about $15.00. It pays to check the UK site because bargains can be had all the time.    The sonics on my UK discs are terrific. Even though this current offering has been remastered, there wasn't much to improve upon to begin with. I see mention of an SACD version being offered on the Japan site, so those with the appropriate equipment might want to go there. In any case, this set is highly recommended.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Conductor Fritz Reiner beautifully captures the fragrant aromas of Rimsky-Korsakov's exotic orchestrations  with great poetry and sensitivity and just the right touches of elegance and flair from concertmaster Sidney Harth and the Chicago Symphony to make this one of the greatest performances ever.  I am always stirred by the trumpet player's tonguing technique here and the driving, onward pace of the final movement of Scheherazade.  The Stravinsky is also a marvel to hear, one of the thrilling and colorful works that display the composer's indebtedness to his wonderful composition teacher, Rimsky-Korsakov. The mastering in this edition is spectacular in SACD and all three specialized formats and the compatibility all in one disk is extraordinary.
B0013FXWVU|4.0|Let's start with the easy part. Whoville is as Seussian as one could hope, right down to the last leggy contraption and skewed piece of architecture. The Jungle of Nool comes across just as well - you can't tell the plants from the animals until one smiles at you, and maybe not then. The animators had the good sense to leave most of their fancier effects at home, and use those other few with generally good taste. The animators' restraint let the good doctor's story come through about as well as one could hope. Unlike other recent movies, this at least lets me enjoy my childhood memories of the original.<br /><br />It's not the original, though, not by any means. That was short enough to read end to end when putting a kid to bed, without tiring your vocal cords. An awful lot happened on the way to making it a feature-length movie. The good news is that most of that lot wasn't too awful. Oh, the pasted-on bad guy, that was very un-Seussily done, but most of the rest fit the spirit well enough. At least, it seemed to. Now I have to go back and check again, but that's not such a bad thing either.<br /><br />It's a good kids' movie. It's pretty much just a kids' movie, though. The best kids' movies have plenty to keep the ticket-buying grownups entertained, too, and I'm afraid this doesn't rise to their needs. But it keeps the kids happy, judging by the little voices I heard laughing throughout - when I could hear them over my own laughter.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000XUUQQK|1.0|I thought the original Boogeyman film was suspenseful, well paced and really scary. This 'sequel' is total drivel. It's not even a sequel in the true sense of the word - the only similarity to the original is the title and is nothing more than yet another pathetically bad 'Scream' clone! There should be some trade description law prohibiting vague and tenuous cash-ins on original titles!
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|This brilliant farce, completed just as America entered the war due to Pearl Harbour, was as controversial as it was clever. Ernst Lubitsch, like Charlie Chaplin a few years earlier with \\"The Great Dictator\\", dared to set a comedy around the Nazis. Like Chaplin's film, it opened to mix reviews, offending both critics and the public and was not a great success.    Given that premise, this is a brilliantly scripted and directed comedy set in Warsaw at the outbreak of the war. An acting troupe outwit the Nazis's plan to destroy the underground. The plot is outrageous and hilarious. Jack Benny plays the leading actor and it is no co-incidence that he wishes to play Hamlet because he is a ham himself. Benny is beautifully paired with the gorgeous Carole Lombard as his flirtatious wife. This was Lombard's last film before she tragically died in an air crash. She was at the height of her powers. There are many great supporting actors but Sig Rumann as Concentration Camp Erhart is a standout. Surely he was the basis for the Colonel in Hogan's Heroes. The film was successfully remade as a musical comedy by Mel Brooks many years later but this version is the best.    The print of the film is OK and the DVD contains 2 short films starring Benny; the first, made in 1930 stars him as a conventional comedic leading man and is mildly amusing and the second is war time propaganda. The DVD is OK value but better if purchased as part of the Comedy Classics set.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|Conductor Fritz Reiner is unbelievably precise with the baton with just enough emotional fervor, energy, and commitment to rouse the phenomenal Chicago players of the late 1950's to one of the greatest compilations of a colorful Russian showcase.  The Pictures is one of the finest I have ever heard and the Colas Breugnon and Borodin pieces are exceptionally delightful treats.  The mastering is spectacular in all three specialized CD formats and the compatibility is extraordinary.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|First off, if you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. Each shot is a visual masterpiece and it is a very original story. The cinematography, acting and directing are perfect. A perfectly genetically engineered film.<br /><br />The quality of the Blu-ray is amazing and could not look any better. The little featurettes and documentaries are pretty cool, but the main treat is the movie itself. And with Amazons price of $20, it is an offer you can't pass up. Very much worth replacing your good old fashioned DVD with. Highly recommended.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Straight out of a conservative, private university. Decked out in the brightest of pastel prep apparel. Singing songs based in African melody and rhythm. In all honesty, it sounds like some comic musing of the music industry, but no. It's Vampire Weekend, fresh off the SXSW circuit and gearing up for Bonnaroo among countless other festivals. You will be hearing their name a lot, as their self-titled debut is riding on the heels of much hype and publicity, but alas comes the age old question. Is the album worth it? Does the young band actually live up to the hype or is this another buzzworthy blog band hanging on to their 15 minutes?<br /><br />The album starts off with the sunny, island feel of \\"Mansard Roof,\\" clocking in slightly over two minutes. The song stands as a pretty good introduction to what the remainder of the album has in store, as it doesn't do too much in straying away from its African influenced sound. If there's anything you'll notice about the album, it's that the music has an overall calm feeling... never too loud but not too quiet. Vampire Weekend are successful in finding that happy medium that won't wear your ears out, but will still keep you curious enough to check out the next track. Stand out tracks like the ever popular and increasingly overplayed \\"A-Punk,\\" the toe tapping \\"Campus,\\" and the slightly rock-singed \\"I Stand Corrected\\" are sure to have your head bobbing and your lips singing along in no time. The album proves to be quite catchy, but more so in a refreshing manner. It's a nice step away from the clashing guitars and raucous attitudes that have been clouding up the scene lately.<br /><br />So that brings us back to the question... is the album worth it? Well... it's definitely worth a spin. Some people will undoubtedly write this effort off as recycled pop music in line with the history of Talking Heads and other such bands. Although it's fairly obvious that Vampire Weekend may have been influenced by such bands and stylings, they do a very good job of standing their own ground... putting together 11 pretty solid pop tracks that at times seem so simple, effortless, and laid back. Trust me when I say that you'll find this album sneaking its way through your headphones time and time again. Is it a good effort? Yes. Would I deem it a masterpiece? By no means. But certainly it's one of the better albums to come my across my ears this year, and has me curious as to what this band will turn out next. Simply put, they are worth checking out.<br /><br />Rating: 7.9/10job of standing their own ground... putting together 11 pretty solid pop tracks that at times seem so simple, effortless, and laid back.

B0006Z2KXE|5.0|\\"The Philadelphia Story\\" is a streamlined example of superlative movie making. Directed impeccably by George Cukor, the film was based on a play written specifically for Katharine Hepburn when she re-invented her career on Broadway after leaving RKO in 1938, a box office has been at aged 31. The script was superbly tailored to Hepburn's image and mannerisms and the humanising of Tracey Lord, the lead character, is indelibly linked to the humanising of Hepburn. Surrounded by high class MGM production values, 2 popular box office stars, Cary Grant and James Stewart, and a perfect supporting cast, the film was a box office smash and remade as \\"High Society\\", an equally succesful musical in the fifties with Grace Kelly. This was the film which really launched Katharine Hepburn to immortality and there are some excellent one liners. Special mention of Ruth Hussey, a typical second rung actress who never had quite enough individuality to make the top but never gave a bad performance.  She is outstanding here. The print of the film is superb too.    This two-disc special has some great extras. Janine Basinger provides a detailed and well paced commentary covering all bases. Basinger is one of the best of the historians because she understands the context of the films about which she speaks and her delivery is always clear. Equally as interesting is the film about Hepburn made in 1992. Hepburn herself narrates. Clearly, at age 85, she was prepared to speak of things which had been off limits for years and in doing so, she perpetuates her legend cleverly. In the light of recent biographies about her, this film offers a number of challenges and is compulsory viewing.    A documentary interview with George Cukor is also included, part of a series of documentaries on famous film makers - invaluable to those interested in the history of film. Other extras include a funny short film with Robert Benchley, a cartoon and a couple of radio adaptions of the film, always only of minorinterest when the original film is available.    The DVD is excellent value but even better if purchased as part of the Classic Comedies set.
B000008L90|5.0|This CD has songs on it that are unique and touch your heart.  The lyrics are powerful.    One of my favorites by Donna Summer. Produced by Michael Omartian, this album has powerful messages and a musical style that you want to hear over and over.    This album should of been on the top charts, it was underrated, but there are many of us that appreciate it.  I love every song especially \\"Forgive Me\\" and \\"Oh Billy Please\\".    I highly recommend it!

B00004SAAY|4.0|There are nineteen concertos in this collection, twelve of which are for one or more harpsichords. The remaining seven are concertos for various other instruments including violin, oboe, etc.  A potential buyer should be aware that many of Bach's harpsichord concertos are re-arranged versions of these other concertos - and in some cases both versions are in this collection. For example, the three violin concertos (including the \\"double\\" concerto) are presented in both their original and harpsichord arrangements.  Two oboe concertos, whose original versions have been lost, are reconstructed from harpsichord concertos that Bach arranged from those originals. Both the reconstructed oboe and harpsichord versions are in this set. So the listener should not be surprised to hear the same tunes repeated on different CDs in this collection. (It's because of this repetition that I rated the collection four stars instead of five.) One concerto for harpsichord and recorders is even a re-arranged version of Brandenburg #4 - although the Brandenburg concertos themselves are not present.     Despite the repetition of material, the performances themselves are superb. I typically find the work of the English Concert to be top notch and this set is no exception.  My favorites are the violin concertos BWV 1042 and BWV 1043, which are so well presented I consider them the best versions of these works I have yet heard. In some recordings by other orchestras, the violinists play with too much vibrato. A single note can quiver so much it sounds like it hovers between two notes. But here Simon Standage restrains the vibrato and lets his notes sing out with a delightful precision, as do the other players.     There are more concertos for harpsichord here than concertos for other instruments. I actually prefer the latter over the former. To me the harpsichord is a somewhat weak instrument for concertos.  Although its sound is charming and evokes the feeling of the old world orchestra, it cansometimes seem overpowered by the accompanying instruments. But this is not to criticize the playing of Trevor Pinnock or the others. They produce the authentic sound they are looking for with grace and precision. Perhaps the feeling I get of the harpsichord being weak comes from comparing the harpsichord versions of the violin concertos with the violin originals, which are so magnificent.     When all is said and done, I am happy I purchased this music. Listening to it is like being transported back to the early 18th century, when these pieces were fresh and new. I'm sure Bach would be pleased if he could hear what a wonderful job the English Concert did with his work.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I won't bore you with the story or plot of the film here, I want to report on the quality of the transfer to blu-ray.<br /><br />So many films have been released on blu-ray that do little justice to the HD format: this is NOT one of those films.  Along with Kingdom of Heaven, this is one of Ridley Scott's true masterpieces.  The ultimate edition is not much different than the director's cut (which was a vast improvement on the theatrical release), but the set contains every edition released.  I do not intend to ever watch the theatrical release ever again as the narration was a horrible afterthought by the film execs (who really should not [...] in where they have no expertise).  Both the director's cut and ultimate cut are included as well so you can select which to view.  There are plenty of extras that are well worth watching, again not the norm (most extras are empty filler).<br /><br />Basically if you are looking to purchase this, you have already seen Blade Runner and I am here to say YES the blu-ray is worth the purchase, WELL worth it!
B0013FXWVU|5.0|Theodore Geisel as Dr. Seuss wrote and illustrated some great children's picture books which taught some real life lessons beyond the silly language and whimsical drawings. HORTON HEARS A WHO with its theme of \\"a persons a person no matter how small\\" is among the best.  However when I heard a film was being made out of it I couldn't get excited.  Hollywood's version of THE CAT IN THE HAT has to be one of the worst (as well as the most tasteless) \\"family\\" films ever made and the Jim Carrey live action version of GRINCH couldn't compare to the holiday animated TV classic from the 60's.    Yet this Blue Sky animated production of \\"Horton\\" is miraculously almost perfect.  Both Horton's native Jungle of Nool  and the Who's universe ( a speck on a clover flower) are brought brilliantly to surreal life with cutting edge CGI graphics.  The voice actors are great with Jim Carrey (not overacting this time or maybe his goofy style is just more suited to animation?) as the kind hearted pachyderm Horton.  Carol Burnett is fantastic as Horton's  kangaroo nemesis who wants to keep \\"the children safe\\" from their imaginations.  The eccentric but lovable  mayor of Who-ville is played by the consistently funny Steve Carrel.   Plus there are scores of well done supporting parts from comic relief Morton the Mouse to villainous Vlad the Vulture.  This is truly a film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  And don't miss the clever effect in the closing scene.

B00000DMJF|3.0|The Beatles are, without a doubt, my favorite band. By quite a long shot, in fact. But I'm not under the impression their music was infallible by any means, and to me this serves as a rude interruption to the greatest winning streak (which began with Help! and ended with Let It Be) in rock history. Every Beatles album but this released from 1965-1970 deserves 4.5-5 stars. This one... well, it confuses me.<br />It's too bad, because it's got its strengths. Even for a Beatles record, it's diverse - the first four tracks alone have them going from surf-rock to psychedelic folk to chamber-pop to pseudo-ska without missing a beat. It's very well arranged and produced. And fourteen of these thirty tracks are among the Beatles' absolute finest songs. \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" is a funny parody of the Beach Boys, Ray Charles, and Chuck Berry. \\"Dear Prudence\\" is lush, trippy, and lovely, with some fine harmonies. \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" gets maligned a lot, but I think it's fun. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is a deep-thinking rock epic, with a legendary guitar solo from George's Eric Clapton. The three-part \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" is the best on the record, one part haunting acid rock, one part ear-bursting proto-metal, one part mock doo-wop. \\"Martha My Dear\\" shows Paul at his best with a big, over-the-top, sweetly melodic pop song. \\"Blackbird\\" is another lovely Paul ballad; the retro \\"Birthday\\" is a fine flat-out rocker; \\"Yer Blues\\" is a funny blues parody; \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey\\" is the group at their most infectious; \\"Sexy Sadie\\" has bitter anti-Mariashi lyrics and a fine piano part to match; \\"Helter Skelter\\" rocks, an efficient response to the extreme experiments with volume of Hendrix, Jeff Beck and the Who that were occurring in '68; \\"Revolution 1\\" isn't as good as \\"Revolution\\", but those are some nice horns, and I adore those \\"shoo-be-doo-wop\\" harmonies; lastly, \\"Savoy Truffle\\" is a funky rocker with a guitar v. sax showdown that probably inspired several Rolling Stones hits. Those fourteen would've definitely kept the album's scope intact, and would've made for the greatest album ever. And even the tossoff goof tracks (\\"Rocky Raccoon\\", \\"Piggies\\", \\"Glass Onion\\"; \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\\"; \\"I'm so Tired\\") are well-produced, well-written, quirky, and memorable.<br />The problem lies in the remaining few songs. \\"Julia\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" aren't exactly bad, but they're incredibly blah. And Ringo gets screwed. While he had always got the more \\"lightweight\\" songs in the first place, they were always amicable, and some of them were great.  Neither of his songs is anywhere close to that. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" (which he wrote) is an awful country hoedown, and \\"Good Night\\" (which he didn't right) is so schmaltzy it hurts.  Paul's interest in '30s jazz had resulted in two great songs on previous albums (\\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", \\"Your Mother Should Know\\") comes back to bite him in the butt on \\"Honey Pie\\", which can't decide if it wants to be a straight-faced homage to the genre or a mocking parody - it's a poor song either way you cut the pie. No pun intended. Seriously, I had already forgotten the word \\"pie\\" was in the song's title by the time I wrote it. That says a lot about me, doesn't it? And \\"Wild Honey Pie\\", the twisted cousin to \\"Honey Pie\\" is mindless indulgence. Short, yes, but horrendous. And \\"I Will\\" is extremely dull, though it's funny how it comes after \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" on the tracklist.  Of course, Paul's not the only one to blame. John did come up with the record's biggest travesty, the notorious sound collage \\"Revolution 9\\", as well as the childish, condescending \\"Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\"; \\"Cry Baby Cry\\", an attempt at Syd Barrett-esque whimsy that fails because it lacks what really made Syd's whimsical songs interesting: the undercurrent of menace and insanity. I think he's responsible for \\"Good Night\\", too. George doesn't escape unscathed either,chipping in \\"Long, Long, Long\\", which other than the flute is dreary.<br />So this had the potential to be great, but ego gets in the way. Hey, maybe it was made big, sprawling, and messy on purpose, so fans could pick out their own favorites! Who knows?ng in \\"Long, Long, Long\\", which other than the flute is dreary.

B000GTJT0M|2.0|Interesting movie... the graphic backgrounds are brilliant in a 1930's serial throwback kind of way, especially in the first 20 minutes, and it's worth seeing just for that, but the script is truly dismal, Jude Law is too bland to carry a movie of this type, and don't get me started on what I think of Angeline Jolie's \\"acting\\".

B000WQWPKA|5.0|If this movie had even a nanogram of pretense, I would dump all over it. But, it does not.<br /><br />Roland Emmerich trots out every clich&eacute; and stereotype imaginable, yet it is impossible to take offense at any of them. It is a \\"B\\" movie in every sense of the phrase, save for big name stars and a big, big budget. There are good guys and bad guys and evil aliens and loads of twists and turns. The plot line is as predictable as predictable can be, but you love every second of it. Special effects? You betcha! Seriously terminally ugly aliens? By the boatload. Tearjerker moments? You got'em. Stirring moments? When the President delivers his \\"we will not go quietly into the night\\" speech, you want to leap to your feet and salute. And I could go on but I hope you get the picture.<br /><br />The real bottom line on this movie is that it is just plain good fun, suitable for all ages, and one that I can watch 2 or 3 times a year and never be bored for a moment. I don't know how many times I've watched this movie (it's got to be on the high side of 15, but I still love it every time.<br /><br />The transfer to Blu-Ray is outstanding, with magnificent color and resolution, and the soundtrack, well, puts those ugly suckers right in your living room with you.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. Emmerich, well done.

B001F0WXY0|1.0|I tried to read this once when I was about 15, had trouble getting through the first few chapters. Now im in my twenties, ive read quite a few of the older hugo award winners this was one that I had neglected to read from the list so i thought id give it another shot. My problem with the book is that it is just too incredibly tedious, my kindle tells me that I completed 57% of it and that was about as far as i was willing to go. When you read a book and the thought of whether or not to just stop where you are or keep going in the off chance that something good will come of it, enters your mind, then just stop reading. A good book will never let that thought enter your brain. The main characters were incredibly flat and static, and too be honest it got to the point where it was going nowhere and it was heading there fast. as other readers and reviewers have noted there is a slogan in the writing business, show dont tell, well mr.herbert must have never heard that saying. Most of the book, up until i stopped reading, were just thoughts of the main characters, jessica and paul. Paul being the protagonist of the novel should be an incredibly dynamic and round character but he is in fact not. After his \\"awakening\\" ,i guess that's the only word for it, he really got obnoxious and had this whole teen-angst feel to his attitude I guess.       I consider myself a smart guy, I'm an engineering student and ive pretty much read science fiction my entire life, so this is no fault of my own. I really don't understand why this book has so much fan-fare surrounding it, or why it won a hugo award. if your looking for good science fiction, i'd recommend \\"Way Station\\" by clifford simack, or \\"A canticle for leibowitz\\" i forget the author, also \\"The Man In The High Castle\\" by philip k. dick. much better than this over rated \\"novel\\".
B0000028MA|5.0|I am starting to make the transition between Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, etc. and more unknown early 90's music so this CD seemed like a good buy. I  couldn't be happier. Not only are there songs on here by Chris Cornell and Pearl Jam that I never heard before, but I got to listen to other bands such as the Screaming Trees. All in all, this is a great CD for someone who is looking to branch out from the mainstream grunge music of the early 90's but is a little unsure of what to try next.

B000TGCR38|4.0|Well shot movie; it IS Bittersweet, and it is a war movie and it does have the elements of a thriller. Watched this movie last night and really enjoyed. This morning I paused to think about the futility of it all (war and death) and how some people manage to survive this sort of horror.    That a movie can make you reflect on this I think always says something.    As for some who think that this movie is gratuitous in its sexual content; that is just absolute nonsense!! I was amazed to read reviews this morning that seemed to focus on this but miss the wider thoughts of the movie.    As I said great movie and well worth the watch; well shot and quite authentic in its portrayal of the time.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I think this is a fine movie.  Particularly well acted and the story itself comes from Patrick O'Brian's 10th book in his Aubrey-Maturin series.  Now the movie isn't as good as the book but then Patrick O'Brian has been praised as the greatest writer of historical fiction by many respected sources.  Other than the Lonesome Dove miniseries, I don't recall any better movie adaptation of historical fiction.  I found this movie far superior to the Hornblower movies.  I only wish they would trouble to use the same actors and make movies of the rest of the series.
B000IJ7Q32|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I must admit I mostly read fiction, so I cannot compare this book to other writings, but I found the book well-written and easy to understand.     The author gives a bunch of examples to illustrate and justify his arguments and tells us dozens of stories to complement his ideas. The book is quite long but I rarely got bored while reading it. There is always an interesting detail to focus on and keep turning pages.     The books covers different past and present societies as examples to illustrate various factors influencing a tendency for a society to collapse. Easter Island, Vikings, Rwanda (genocide), Dominican Republic and Haiti and Polynesian Islands are among them.     I found the last part of the book a bit less convincing and harder to follow. The author describes his concerns about mines, forests, fishing,... and some parts seem endless.     Anyway, most of the book is great and I think everyone should have a look at it.
0374105235|5.0|This is a great book. It is important story and relates to the worls biggest issues today. After reading the book I read the article The fog of the Memoir. I found valid points but most of it came across as gossip and misunderstanding. I first was dissapointed that the character I felt sorrow for, and fell in love with never existed but then I thought about american culture and how hard it must be for the average american to picture a world unlike the one they live in. Ishmael had built uo the courage to tell a story and the media attacks him. This is a wonderful book and dont let the media ruin it like it did for so many readers.
B00102FELM|5.0|I've been collecting concert DVD's for some time now and I'd have to say that this is one of the best concerts I've seen and it is now one of my favorites!  I've been watching it over and over again.  Being a child of the 80's, I always enjoyed the Scorpians especially back in the day.  I remember rocking out all summer to Love at First Sting.  These guys still rock, better than ever!  It's great that they played all of the oldies.  The video and sound quality is excellent.  Klaus's voice is still very good.  James Kottak and Pawel are great, not to mention Rudolf and Matthias.  I love watching Rudolf, here's a great rythum player and is very funny onstage.  It's really cool to see Uli Roth, Michael Schenker, and Herman Rarebell too.  These guys are great!
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie, but it seems that the steady slope of quality stories an acting found in the last two seasons of the series continues here. The actors used to take the plotlines and scripts seriously but now it seems that they've opted for \\"campiness\\". A lot of the plot doesn't make sense.     SPOILER ALERT: It seems that the weapon sent to the Ori galaxy at the end of seson 10 worked, the Ori are all dead already but they've channeled all their power into Adriel. The Ark, that is supposed to have been missing for upteen thousands of years is rediculously easy to find and decipher. Let's not forget a gratuitous replicator subplot that seems to have been put in just to take up time.     There's another bad guy that is just so textbook you could tell what he's going to do a mile off. I'm looking forward to the next movie as it's a \\"stand alone\\" plot but this one got shelved after the first viewing.

Before accepting any do-gooder's scheme to lift up the poor, make sure it isn't yet another way that does nothing more than keep the poor in their place- away from the 'better' people.

0307387151|5.0|Three central character's lives predominatly populate and play out like a live theatre show throughout the pages of 'Atonement' by Ian McEwan. There is young thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis, who, thanks to her false interpretations of two given situations between childhood friend Robbie Turner, and older sister Cecilia Tallis, at the scene of a fountain and a library, must all live with the concequences. 'Atonement' is also a love story in a time of war. This book is full to bursting point of intensely, richly descriptive words, that encourages the reader to participate in the books events. Ian McEwan clearly demonstates his mastery over the written language, and shows prospective authors how limitless and imaginatively descriptive a finished work of fiction can become. A must for anyone with a love of reading and in need of a book that leaves a lasting impression. I heard about the movie with Keira Knightley first, but decided after seeing a preview of the film, and after reading a review of the film that gave nothing away, decided on reading the book first. I'm glad I did. I knew if I didn't the film would prompt me to read the book. I decided on the movie cover to help inspire me to pick up and read the book. Just as I decided to read the 'Pride & Prejudice' book with Keira Knightley on it as well. It all helped the reading process.

1416914293|4.0|While City of Bones focuses on plot, City of Ashes revolves around the emotions of the characters. Clare provides an in depth look at Jace, Clary, and Simon's teen angst, which makes for a \\"sort of\\" love triangle. The Seelie Court chapter and the next few are some of Clare's best. The air crackles with intense electricity! We also discover the special powers that Jace and Clary possess which makes them unique among Shadowhunters.<br /><br />The plot seemed somewhat weaker than City of Bones, or maybe it didn't capture my interest as much. Most of it dealt with rescuing Jace from the Inquisitor, who believed he was a spy for his father. Valentine kidnapped a few people, resulting in a final battle that seemed hopeless. Naturally, there were lots of descriptions of demons being killed. This is a much darker book, so be prepared for some sadness and unexpected drama!<br /><br />Now about the characters... Simon gets a lot more interesting (that's all I will say because I don't want to spoil it ;) And I have a greater respect for Clary now that she is more emotionally complex. Maia's tragic background was well done, but she was always crying about something and that took away from her character. Max, the youngest and most adorable Lightwood, is my favorite addition to the cast.<br /><br />Oh, and the epilogue leaves a great cliffhanger for us! Just one more year to see how everything turns out...

B00133KFGW|1.0|This film has been widely classified as \\"a fairy tale\\" for our times. But a fairy tale, as Bruno Bettleheim pointed out long ago, contains gritty elements of psychological realism and represents symbolically through its ogres and witches the dangers which all children confront on the road to maturity.     \\"August Rush,\\" on the other hand is just an indulgent exercise in New Age Wish Fulfillment. It could more accurately be classified not as a fairy tale but, to put it mildly, as \\"a vast betrayal of life.\\" Consider in this regard its opening. A rock musician scores after a first meeting with a classical cellist on the rooftop of a Greenwich Village flat. She learns after their one-night-stand that she's pregnant. Naturally, these two individuals of low responsibility, separated after their only encounter by a controlling Hollywood-type parent, continue to hunger for each over an eleven year period. Yeah, right! Similarly, the controlling parent allows his erring daughter to bear the child, but then forges her signature to give it up for adoption. Shades of pleasing everybody, \\"Juno\\" or \\"Murphy Brown\\" style. Out of wedlock liasons are given a pass, so as to be thought daring, but pregnancies are then carried to term, so as not to the offend the pro-life section of the audience. This is once again the Hollywood mentality, trying to have things both ways, beginning with the seemingly daring, but landing on a very neat, conventional trajectory.    The film, sad to say, goes from bed to worse. Children, I'm sure, would quickly see through its escalating preposterousness. Some weak-minded adults, on the other hand, interested in instant uplift, might be inclined to find it \\"spiritual\\" and \\"exhilarating.\\" As Oscar Wilde said in another context, \\"only a man without a heart\\" could fail to laugh at the trials and tribulations of the characters in \\"August Rush.\\"    The only bearable performance, for my money, is that of Freddie Highmore, a talented child actor. Unfortunately, however, he may be finding himself, like Haley Joel Osment earlier, pushed into bad roles that undermine his ostensible skills. \\"August Rush,\\" I'd argue, is Freddie Highmore's \\"Pay It Forward.\\" One hopes he or his agents exercise a better choice over scripts in the future. The worst performance in the film, not surprisingly, comes from Robin Williams, who became an act rather than an actor in \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" and has yet to recover. Just like Dustin Hoffman in recent roles, he's here playing yet another caricature of a weirdo to diminishing effect. The one star is for Freddie Highmore.

It gives the ideas and experience, that you can use for the advantage.<br /><br />Book starts with description about ekiben, special type of food that is sold in Japan trains. Author finds ekiben great balanced type of food, which he calls a pleasant way to end the day. Author wonders, where is the problem to make all the presentation in the same way, balanced and harmonized...<br /><br />You will find plenty of author's thoughts and ideas, that can be very helpful for your future presentations and hints how to find the balance.<br /><br />Book provides great examples,  one of them is from Seth Godinh [if I'm not mistaken], when presenting about pollution in your city, what is better<br />1) four bullet points about pollution data<br />or<br />2) photo of bunch of dead birds, some smog or even diseased lung, and talk give this information enclosed in four bullets.<br /><br />Which is better and more effective, well I think the answer is clear, and there are others examples too.<br /><br />There are other examples and ideas, that you may find interesting and learn to make your presentations better (at least it worked for me). However, I'm just rookie in this stuff.<br /><br />This Book should be placed for your must have category, if you have any relation to presentations.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I originally rented the movie,and loved it.  So I knew I'd want the soundtrack,as well as owning the movie.  I'm a big fan of \\"Rock Operas\\",and this is really well done.  Aside from the musical aspect,it also has a really cool storyline.  The cast is superb,especially Bono's cameo. If you're a fan like myself,  of the genre. Or if you like the Beatles,you should enjoy both the movie &  soundtrack.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I watched this movie on my home theater system and found it to be one of my favorites movies of the year.  I am a combat Vietnam Veteran and man, did this movie evoke emotions in me. The war protest, the political radicals, the displaced vet--done so well. The movie integrates the Beatles music in a unique manner (acting the music rather than just singing it). The visuals are mind-blowing and the acting is academy award with \\"unknown\\" actors.  Be  sure to watch the extras --they are worth the price of the DVD alone.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is the first time I have ever reviewed anything on Amazon, but I am compelled because I was simply amazed at how much I loved this movie. I'm in my 30's, my parents were the Real Deal, true hippies, and I grew up on the Beatles as well as other music of the time. As a definite Beatles fan, I was always intrigued by the movie but wondered if it would ruin the music for me, or just because of the fact that it wasn't the Beatles themselves singing, I'd never get into it. I didn't see it in the theaters, only watched it recently when visiting my mom & dad, at their insistence. We didn't start watching it until after 11 at night, and I told them, \\"I will never be able to stay up to watch the whole thing...\\"<br /><br />Well, I don't think I even blinked during this movie! At first, it was just interesting to see which song would be sung next. But as it went on, I was so into it, falling asleep was absolutely the last thing on my mind. The movie itself was great, while it wasn't the most original storyline ever - lovers and friends torn apart by the state of the world - the characters were great, and it was just so held together by all of the music. I loved the little references slipped in... the best of course being when Prudence comes into the apartment wet from the rain, and Sadie asks \\"Where did she come from?\\" - the answer: \\"She came in through the bathroom window\\"!<br /><br />The emotional impact that so many scenes had was fantastic, and most of that was because of the brilliant way they used the music in the movie. Songs were sung by different characters, in different scenes, at times on different continents, and yet it was so cohesive, it all fit. \\"Let it Be\\" nearly had me crying, \\"Revolution\\" was used brilliantly, \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" had my heart practically racing feeling what those characters were feeling, and the emotions behind \\"Oh Darling\\" were unbelievably intense. I could list something amazing about every single song and the way it was used, but those are just some examples.<br /><br />One thing that made me really appreciate this movie was that afterwards, in talking to my parents about it, they commented that of all of the movies they had seen of that time, this was one of the best to show what things were like for them back then. And I was also fascinated that I ran out and bought the soundtrack right away - I would have never expected, no matter how much I liked the movie, to have wanted so badly to have CDs of people other than the Beatles singing these songs! Please note, though, that if you want the soundtrack, do not waste your time and money with the condensed version - hold out until you find the 2-disc one, otherwise you will only be frustrated at all of the songs not on the single disc!<br /><br />There are plenty of people out there who would never be able to get into this movie, which is understandable - it's got plenty of psychedlic, sometimes hard-to-follow things going on. But if you even THINK you could enjoy this movie, I implore you to watch it right away! Because I only thought I might \\"kind of, sort of\\" like it, and it is now somewhere in my Top 20 of all time favorite movies! It's a must - if you like the Beatles, if you like the 60's - an absolute MUST!some examples.

B000JLPMPS|5.0|Unforgiven is not just a Western movie. It is a statement. It is in my top ten list of all time great movies. This is Clint Eastwood at his best. The movie is an allegory, metaphor and masterpiece. The characterization of human failing, guilt, determination, cruelty,love, hate,and indifference in one movie is beyond measure. The blu-ray version captures the beauty of the country with magical sunsets amidst a story of revenge and ultimately a quest for forgiveness.

B000U1ZV3U|4.0|What makes a good western movie? One, it must have a solid story line. Two, it needs to have great scenery depicting the \\"old west.\\" Third, it should have a mix of action and intrigue. Four, it needs experienced actors. Finally, it needs to stand by itself and not be a recapitulation of a former movie.  Wyatt Earp meets all the criteria.  Excellent movie with breath-taking scenery on the Blu-Ray disk. Dr. Horn
B000YABYLA|3.0|I didn't see why this movie was so popular for its witty humor and writing. That kind of writing has been around for a while now on TV shows.  Like the Gilmore Girls for example.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|See La Jet&eacute;e to appreciate what Gilliam did here. I'd say it's probably his best film. It reminds me of Michel Foucault actually in it's dealing with insanity and history and a bald guy. And the original short film is French and then at one point in 12 Monkeys we find ourselves in the trenches of the first world war with French troops.<br /><br />It's a scary film, but ultimately provides a slim glimmer of hope out of the immensely melancholic backdrop of our doomed world and the post-apocalyptic one of the near future. Sort of. I found bizarre and moving the story of the lead character Cole, played by Bruce Willis. Aside from PULP FICTION, this is his best performance. His story and that of his doctor, played by Madeleine Stowe, give the movie some heart and make what ultimately unfolds hard to take. Brad Pit is excellent as a loony animal rights activist and if anyone thinks he doesn't have acting chops, they should see the pretty boy in this role.<br /><br />IMHO, Gilliam's best film and one with a truly scary premise, if anything because we could realistically see it happening in the real world. One single nutcase could obtain a lethal airborne virus and spread it all over the world within a couple of days just by hopping on planes. Unfortunately we don't have the ability to time travel. I wish we'd see more science fiction film making of this quality...
1594489505|4.0|Khalid Hosseini is a wonderful writer and I enjoyed the book despite being reminded of how males can use many ploys to keep their women controlled, especially in Afghanistan, etc.  My only reason for saying it is his SECOND best book is 1- I loved his first book so much, and 2- I think the dominate and over-riding character(s) and plot (almost non-fiction)in this book are women.  I think females will more closely identify with and feel compassion for their female kin.  This book gives us the plight of a nation over the last 25-30 years.  It does not hesitate to show that, for females, the pain does not only come from wars and religious bigotry, but also from the home.  From father to brother to husband the male is shown to be cruel and dominating... all leading to even more pain, suffering and 2nd class citizenship.

B0013FDM7E|3.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I was into I AM LEGEND completely. All the way up to the revilation scene, when Robert Neville (Will Smith) finds out that he isn't alone and quite frankly, I AM LEGEND fell completely off the table and crashed into a million pieces.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND had a premise that we've scene hundreds of times. OMEGA MAN. 28 DAYS LATER. You can't be out after dark. Zombies, or forms thereof. The only survivor of an incredible catastrophe. Yet, what it didn't do, is anything different. When you thought it was going in a cool direction and you were seeing something completely new and a completely original twist on an otherwise overused premise, you realized... nope... same old stuff. Nothing worth remembering.<br /><br />The scenes of Will Smith racing through the baron, littered and grass covered streets of New York City, hunting deer and avoiding Lions were top notch. The scenes of him using the video store as a social outlet, with strategically placed mannequins, were well done and poigniant. The scene where he reluctantly followed his dog into the shadowed building that housed the infected humans were frightening.<br /><br />Everything was going so well... and when Neville used a trap to capture one of the infected and then the infected turned the tables on him, instituting their own trap, I was sold. That was followed by some heart-wrenching moments and a confrontation scene that was creative and realistic. I AM LEGEND was right on. A memorable, hit movie. And then....<br /><br />I AM LEGEND became just another movie. There were characters introduced that broke the movies rhythm. Anna & Ethan? They're clean. Calm. They appear out of nowhere, but have no knowledge of what happens after dark. She manages to save Neville from an onslaught of infected, but then shows no sign of being battle or survival tough.<br /><br />There are moments where the audience isn't allowed to play along, like when the infected find Neville's hideout. It is explained by a single line of dialogue and has little to zero impact.<br /><br />Ultimately though, I AM LEGEND started off unique and just became forgettable and uneventful. When a premise has been done hundreds of times, it's time for a shakeup... something new... we didn't get it with I AM LEGEND. We got 1 hour of unique moments followed by 40 minutes of the same old same old.impact.    Ultimately though, I AM LEGEND started off unique and just became forgettable and uneventful.

0446401307|5.0|This is only a minor degree less satisfying than his last book I read, The Coyote!  To complete a book that only expands about 24 hours, and make it compelling and a joy to read, takes a real mastery of the language and the understanding of how to use the medium (book)... along with the knowledge of what makes a book a page turner.  My wife was on page 37 and told me, \\"so early and I already do not want to put it down.  You will not be disappointed.  Michael Connelly is simply the best.
0790731452|5.0|One reviewer notes the frustration this movie created: \\"This sends we the viewer into an intellectual quandry.We start looking for the 'hook' or the 'bridge' in the plot.\\"<br /><br />Potential viewers who find themselves looking for anything profoundly intellectual in Mars Attacks! should immediately reseal the package and seek whatever financial remuneration is most readily available from the purchase or rental. If you are looking for anything other than an opportunity for 1) a goodly number of righteously earned laughs, 2) visual insanity, 3) jabs at the simplistic and short-sighted approaches our society uses to solve it's problems, and 4) well-buttered, full-of-cholesterol, artery clogging popcorn, then save yourself the pain and read some Tolstoy. There's nothing here for you.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are up for absurd fun, visual imagination on parade, a laundry list of stars willing to offer up themselves and pop-culture to the ray-guns of balloon-headed aliens, then you are in for a treat.<br /><br />On a final note, perhaps the movie, after all, does offer some intellectual insight: Ultimately its the most simple - and human - traits that serve to protect us.
B0013FXWVU|4.0|I enjoyed the modern day retelling of the classic story.  The Blue Sky team which has done Robots and the Ice Age tales have produced another winner.  The colors are crisp and the animation really captures the classic Seuss style.  The story is there, though expanded upon obviously to fill the hour and a half movie.  The narrator was great as he read the Seuss rhymes during points of the story.  The voice acting was strong with Carell and Carrey really giving it there manic best.  Carol Burnette was also strong in her role as a kangaroo.  I thought the humor was solid with most of the jokes working well.  I still laugh at the Vlad joke when I think about it.  I will certainly be purchasing this when it arrives on DVD and I hope Blue Sky will continue to make Seuss stories in the future.

0767802470|5.0|One of the few films about war that is realistic.  The viewer can feel the tension and the fear and enjoy the occasional moments of humor.  When the action moves onto the submarine, you can almost smell the sweat, the spoiled food, the diesel fuel.  I am not normally a big fan of war movies, but this doesn't feel like a movie it feels like real life.  There is no \\"Hollywood\\" here.
0064407667|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in years.  Starting from the first page, the author has us hooked. He (tho I suspect it may be a 'she') tells us not to read the book if we don't like unhappy endings and unfortunate events. Then we are introduced to three children whom he tells us lose their parents (I'm not giving anything away here - he tells us that almost immediately). The parents were wealthy, but the oldest child is 14, so they must stay with a guardian until she comes of age to inherit the fortune.  The guardian is Count Olaf and he has a master plan to nab the childrens' fortune and do away with them.  Definitely not confined to ages 9-12, I think those 12 - adult will enjoy it too.  It is reminiscent of 'Charlie & the Chocolate Factory', an ageless tale of pure reading enjoyment and wonderful illustrations.  I already read book 2 all in one day, yesterday.  I will go on to read the third and, I suspect, the entire series.  THANK YOU, Lemony Sniket, for such creativity and hours of entertainment.

He loved it just as much as the first one.  Great fun!
B00000K31V|5.0|What a weird, creepy, bit of fun this is! It is reminiscent of \\"Naked Lunch\\" (and why not? Cronenberg did THAT one, too!). The game within a game within a game was Excellent! I find it odd that it was a flop at the Box-Office. I first saw \\"ExistenZ\\" the year it first came out on VHS, and enjoyed it immensely. Of course, I'm biased, because I'm a HUGE fan of David Cronenberg's works. Where David Lynch uses a feather floating on air, David Cronenberg uses a sledgehammer (of course, AFTER he has given it his trademark \\"biomechanical\\" look)!    Some would say it has a passing resemblance to films such as \\"The Matrix\\", but I see it as totally unique. As in \\"Naked Lunch\\", we are treated to a trip through Cronenberg's twisted mind, where nothing is as it seems to be. Seeing it through the eyes of Ted Pikul (Jude Law), is this live? Or is it Memorex? Cronenberg leaves you to decide, but for just a little while, when you are treated to another \\"reality\\"! Good ol' Ted is being led around by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the creator of \\"ExistenZ\\", the newest VR game to hit the streets. There are others who take exception to this, however, and try to kill allegra. Ted is forced to do things he would not normally do, but he is pressed into protecting Allegra.    This film is just a lot of fun! Oddities abound. The Uh...weapons, are....unique? Ted's rush to build one, at a restaurant is alternately cool and disgusting. \\"ExistenZ\\" is a must-see for Cronenberg fans, as well as anyone who would like an intriguing thriller/horror film!

Highly recommended!!
B000TGCR3I|5.0|Associating this unique bit of animation to \\"Akira\\" or \\"Ghost In The Shell\\" is misleading. While it is \\"made by\\" the same folk who did \\"The Animatrix\\", \\"Tekkon kinkreet\\" stands alone with it's unique subject matter and presentation. It is akin to a dream. There are elements in the film that suggest this:    1) Both Black and White can \\"float\\" (as well as the \\"Alien\\" Assassins sent to kill them).  2) Looking through White's eyes, it IS hard to delineate reality, especially near the end.  3) Some laws of physics don't seem to apply in Treasure Town.    Within all this IS a good story, however. There seems to be no \\"gray\\" area anywhere in the film. Things are very clear-cut: Good and Bad, Black and White, see where I'm going with this? The film becomes a bit surreal at times, but there is never a point at which you might say \\"what's happening?\\" The separation of Black and White also becomes representative of what happens when those two \\"colors\\" are removed from the rainbow.    This film is quite good. It is not made in the fashion of American \\"beat-you-in-the-head-till-you're-numb\\" sort of fare. It's a film to sit back and relax with. It IS \\"R\\" rated, which precludes certain members of the family from seeing it, but it is not a children's film, anyway (as one may be swayed into thinking, because of it's style of animation).    The DVD has the ubiquitous extras, a making of feature, conversations with the Director and the band that contributed some music for the film, and last but not least, film commentary.
B000GYHVFC|4.0|To make a film out of a series of short animated episodes, little better than running gags for the most part, is no mean feat if a horrible parody of the original is to be avoided. I haven't seen it, aside from a few clips, but I'm pretty sure that Tank Girl is a a good example of what can happen.     The acting is very acceptable for the genre. The action sequences are spectacular, but are too numerous and simply act as a crutch for the drama. The sets including Berlin locations are excellent. And the plot is actually very good if its more philosophical aspects could have been brought more the fore to dramatically support a story that is a development of  a myriad of snippets from the animations to at least make a story from, remain reasonably suggestive of the animations, for those who have seen the animations, but which have no such storyline, as such.     If failings have to be attributed, it is simply that no clear decision was made about who is the audience for this film. Simply hung on the action, as were the animations for the most part, would have been relentlessly tedious at this length of a film. And to approach it from a dramatic development of the plot, would have demanded a degree of dramatisation well beyond the maker's commitment and/or capability. Ridiculous as it may seem, you would need a dramatist of the capability of Harold Pinter to achieve a worthwhile result, and retain a degree of humour.

032147404X|5.0|Both this book and Volume 2 are full of good tips for taking better photos. I've been shooting for over 25 years, so I'm used to opening books and seeing a certain amount of material that I'm already familiar with, but I still learned a lot. I like the format and Kelby's direct and to-the-point style. The books are designed so that every page covers a certain aspect of the topic at hand and provides some kind of useful tip. There isn't a lot of prose, just a 'do this' kind of approach. It helps if you have some experience, because he doesn't spend a lot of time on the 'why' of what he is saying. In many cases you have to think about it and fill in that part of it yourself. However, this approach has the advantage of not burying the 'what' under lots of theory. I highly recommend these books no matter what your level of expertise. Follow his instructions and you will become a better photograher (unless you're already a pro).  Beware of one thing - Kelby's sense of humour. He does state in the very beginning that you can skip the chapter introductions, as they are just his chance to have a little fun and crack some jokes, so don't take them seriously. If you do, you'll find yourself wanting to get your hands on the non-existent \\"Floral filter 1B\\" or whatever he calls it. His humour is a little corny at times and maybe there is a little too much of it, but he did warn you, didn't he?
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Finally, a marvelous, intriguing portrayal of this suspenseful, popular Austen classic. I am so thankful that the actors captured the essence of her complex and honorable characters. Penry-Jones is incredibly handsome, but plays the part with such subtle intensity and passion--those eyes say it all. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the director's choice to have Anne look directly into the camera to connect with the viewer, however, after watching it several times, I think it was a wise, modern choice. It allows us a peek into her soul and what she's really thinking, as Austen might have directed her to do. Bravo! I really recommend this DVD version of this classic piece.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|Yes, this movie SHINES A LITTLE BIT. The plot is interesting. It has quite a few twists. For example, when the current space ship received the beacon signal of the other ship which was sent to space several years ago, they faced a dilemma. They could either continue their trajectory to the sun or they altered it to reach the lost space ship to save its crew members. If they chose the latter, they would not have enough fuel to go to the sun after that.   Later, they had an accident that caused a shortage of the oxygen. Consequently, there was enough oxygen left for only 3 people to survive but there were 7 of them. Who should die to let other live?    Things like that make the movie suspenseful and interesting. However there are two glitches. First, the special effects leave much to be desired. It's below average.     **** WARNING **** SPOILER. DO NOT READ THIS if HAVE NOT WATCHED the film.    Second, the plot about the bad guy who tried to destroy the mission is so illogical that it ruins the movie. He's supposed to die a long time ago. Yet he's able to board the current spaceship without being detected. His body was burnt so badly it showed his raw muscle and vein. Yet, he's very strong and able to kill people!     It's still worth watching once.

B00114LF4E|5.0|I can only join in the chorus of praise. Among the many re-editions that will mark Karajan's 100th anniversary year this 9-CD box assembling all his recordings with the Wiener Philharmoniker between 1959 and 1965 undoubtedly takes first place. Nothing of the 11 hours here is without interest, most of it is indispensable listening, even when seen in the light of forty or so following years of recording, including Karajan's own. There have been countless releases of Mozart's 40th, Beethoven's 7th symphony or Strauss's \\"Zarathustra\\" ever since, on traditional or period instruments, but very few can attain the continuous state of grace that Karajan demonstrates in these Vienna recordings.<br /><br />Besides the admirable variety in repertory that Karajan took under his caring wings (from his personal favourites like Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Richard Strauss to the less obvious choices like Adolphe Adam, Gustav Holst), perhaps the most pleasant surprise when browsing through this box comes from the overall sound picture which is markedly different from what we would later (in the more numerous and prominent Deutsche Grammophon and EMI discs with the Berliner Philharmoniker) come to recognize, like it or not, as the typical \\"Karajan sound\\". Helped by a truly inspired Decca engineering team, these recordings not only amply stand the test of time in presence and dynamics, but more importantly the characteristic colour, refinement and transparency of the Wiener Philharmoniker is miraculously rendered. The silken sound of the strings, the individual colour of the woodwinds and the brass are a constant pleasure. It seems Karajan at this stage of his career and with this particular orchestra was still suggesting rather than dictating, but the result is by any means outstanding.<br /><br />It's tough with such a box of goodies but if I had to point out a few favourites they would be Mozart's 40th symphony, unequalled by the orchestral balance, the phrasing and pulse (how this Mozart sings!), the quality of the strings; Tchaikovsky's ballet suites, a delight of colour, evocative power and atmosphere; Adam's \\"Giselle\\", by any means the most characterful stand-alone recording of this lovely ballet score which Karajan turns into a masterpiece; Richard Strauss's \\"Death and Transfiguration\\", a miracle of orchestral transparency, unravelling the multiple layers of sound to perfection and brought with un unfailing sense of drama.<br /><br />As Doug-Haydn Fan rightly points out this box of \\"Legendary recordings\\" is a superb gift. Even if one already possesses several other recordings of the works included here, it might still prove a revelation.
006135323X|3.0|The concepts were interesting, but often the discussion was lacking.  The most interesting section was the concept of free, which was already covered on NPR on the books release date, and the remainder of the book fell short of expectation.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|One of my all time favorites, fantastic movie, music score and who didn't  love Audrey Hepburn, what a classy lady!!
B000002TQV|5.0|If you enjoy post-punk \\"Alternative Rock,\\" you cannot go wrong here. This album seamlessly melds overdriven, distorted hard rocking guitars with the beautiful melodies that ground punk into a pulp after it gave us the shot in the arm we needed, but faded (thank God) into musical history. This is far better than punk: After all, we get to have our cake and eat it too. There are more beautiful tunes here than I can count in my currently altered state of mind, but as a professional bassist I can tell you this: Get the CD. You'll be singing most if not all these songs and enjoying the experience! Alt Rock was/is a genre that requires that you know how to play your instrument! What a concept! We get brash but melodic (and tuned!) guitars and bass with tight drumming and gut-wrenchingly beautiful vocals. The songs are memorable but not in the annoying jingle-style pop \\"provides.\\" This is real rock. And all this can be yours without having to erase the sneer on your face or even modify your attitude. It's a no-brainer. Grab it!
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has given a gift to people all over the planet: A New Earth.  This is one of those thought-provoking and behavior-changing books. Probably everyone will have to re-read this book at least a couple of times. I have discovered that, while reading the book's excellent description of how to gradually minimize/eliminate the good old ego, it is the ego itself which puts up everything from a fuss, temper tantrus to roadblocks. The ego objects to the subject matter. Fascinating to watch the inner process, albeit sometimes frustrating, realizing this is an ongoing effort.  I am loving the perfect combination of reading this book one chapter per week, while simultaneously participating in the free online global Oprah Bookclub available to everyone.  Very helpful to read the book, then watch/listen to the discussion with questions from the \\"audience\\" and hear Oprah and Eckhart's explanation. I have 3 decades invested in serious ego-work so this book's subject matter clicked-in for me and my group/friends within a yoga-type meditation group.  I strongly recommend this book along with the free Oprah bookclub.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero has Fantastic Cinematography, Choreography, an Amazing story, and Brilliant film production.  This is a masterful film, and a movie to treasure.  I also recommend purchasing [[ASIN:B0007Q6VXC House of Flying Daggers]].  For those who somehow missed [[ASIN:B00003CXR4 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]], I suggest adding that to your wish list, as well.<br /><br />I was only slightly interested in martial arts films, until [[ASIN:B00003CXR4 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]] was created, but [[ASIN:B0007Q6VXC House of Flying Daggers]] and [[ASIN:B00030590I Hero]] have expanded my interests.  These movies are truly masterful productions, and they have inspired many other beautiful films.  This genre is unique and highly recommended.<br /><br />If the name Quentin Tarantino freaks you out, or makes you think only of Gore, Violence, and potty mouths....relax.  This is different: not his usual fare.  Personally, I love Quentin Tarantino movies, but I can understand why some people might avoid HERO, due to his other work.  No worries; this is not what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.  He is a genius, and this movie fits well with the genre of oriental / martial arts / beautiful cinematography films listed above.<br /><br />Don't judge the movie by the name on the cover, but by the reviews and images on the cover.  You will be impressed, amazed, and gain a new respect for Quentin Tarantino.

0783227434|5.0|Back in the day, a roommate brought this home on VHS.  I had always avoided most zombie and Undead flicks, but this one sucked me in.  Bruce Campbell takes himself so seriously, and the action is so wacky that the horrifying Undead creatures are not the main focus.  Sure, I was pinching the seat a bit, but the humorous scenes were relief from the Insane Lovecraftian creatures.<br /><br />The superhero was so smug and sure of himself that he inducted me into Zombie / Undead flicks, and I've always loved this Campy movie.  This is one of those flicks that you can watch again and again.  Also, if you can't get people to watch Undead films, this is a good initiation for your squeamish friends.  I wouldn't start them off with [[ASIN:B000WC3864 The Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition)]].<br /><br />Army of Darkness is one to treasure, and it is always good for laughs amongst fellow geeks.  Bruce Campbell is a superhero for the geeks of the world, even as he gets his arse kicked by Liliputians.
0470185317|5.0|This is one of the best introductory VHDL books out there. Even though it does not focus on the VHDL Language itself it does demonstrate the use of VHDL and the hardware design methodology via practical design examples. All explanantions are clear and easy to follow. The design examples provided in the book are very practical (UART, PS2, VGA controller). The examples themselves are designed using the hardware design methodologies presented (FSM-based and FSMD-based). Finally the Picoblaze section in the textbook is the best treatize of the picoblaze micro that I've seen this far.     For those interested in a more rigourous treatment of the VHDL language, design methodology and synthesis issues (but not practical examples) I also highly recoommend  \\"[[ASIN:0471720925 RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL: Coding for Efficiency, Portability, and Scalability]]\\" by the same author.
B000077VR3|5.0|I love this film, and I would love to see it with Absinthe, preferably Mansynth, but that might still be illegal?  This movie calls for some kind of Altered State, and Margaritas are legal.<br /><br />This movie has everything; beautiful people, singing, acting, performing, dancing, drinking, love, romance, and...best of all...Bohemians.<br /><br />If your buddies give you grief about a Musical, point out that Nicole Kidman is in the flick.  Show them a scene or two.  I'll watch anything with Nicole Kidman, and this is very good !<br /><br />Tell your Congressman to legalize Absinthe, so folks can enjoy the movie as it was probably meant to be viewed.  I hear Marilyn Manson has the good stuff.
0743496736|5.0|This is one of Picoult's best. It gabs you instantly and is hard to put down. This was written shortly before the events at VA Tech which made it timely. A really good read.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I watch all movies with Johnny Depp, but Pen&eacute;lope Cruz sold me on this one!<br />I skimmed the info, but mostly purchased the film based upon the cover shot.  When I watched the film, I felt my self drawn deeper and deeper into the story.  The initial interest in Pen&eacute;lope Cruz subsided, as I became more an more interested in the escalating business practices of our hero played by Johnny Depp.<br /><br />I was rooting for our Business man, throughout the film, and I think he got the shaft.  I loved the movie until the end, but they were working with biographical material so they closed the story as best they could.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this guy is no Scarface; he is just an entrepreneur who enjoys living it up.  I think the guy should have made friends in Congress, so that he could have ended his run and kept his fancy homes, et al.  C'est la vie.
0307346617|3.0|The book and many of it's concepts are good, but the author's political views keep seeping getting in the way... esp since many of them have been proven wrong since the book was published.    And the author's view of the military.  He chip shoots the Iraq War and makes general's look like bumbling idiots, then he give props to a citizen's army and Marine Corps.    Is this just to sell books?    Also his ignorance of the true effect of artillery or airstrikes in favor of using a shovel to kill zombies was a bit much to ignore, as well as bullet performance.    All in all an interesting book that did have some great stuff, but the author should humble himself and do some real research.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I have noted some bad reviews, and few stars but I really liked this film and I am keeping mine.  When this first came out, I was very impressed, but even then I thought that some of the CGI was over the top.  If you suspend disbelief (and / or have a margarita), the movie is very visually appealing.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale, alone, gives the movie a high rating, IMHO.  There are some aspects of the film which are hokey, silly, or overdone, but overall I liked the movie enough to watch it a few times.<br /><br />I recommend watching [[ASIN:B000TGJ80S Bram Stoker's Dracula (Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0001WTUH6 Underworld (Unrated Extended Cut)]], then watch [[ASIN:B0002KVUKM Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)]].
B000UR9T8C|5.0|this is a lot different than the other two and when peter gets the new black suit he acts a little funny, but i enjoyed okay.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|I had high expectations for this movie, especially after [[ASIN:B0002Y69NG The Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions/ The Animatrix)]] series, but Keanu Reeves seems to be playing the same character over and over in different films.  This movie reminded me of his portrayal of previous characters, but mostly he just seemed flat.<br /><br />Despite the casting issues, the movie is visually appealing and the special effects are usually great.  The movie, however, kinda plods along, and I get the feeling that Keanu Reeves would rather be somewhere else.<br /><br />One bonus for me is that The Evil One looks a heck of a lot like my ex-father in law, and that seemed appropriate...but that's just a singular, personal bonus.  Seriously, this is a flawed movie, but it is worth watching.  I expected more, but the visual effects and several scenes compensate the viewer for the slower scenes and general feel of the movie.
0312379293|5.0|It was fun to read a book that kept me entertained so long into the night - not a great literary masterpiece by any means, but just plain exciting and absorbing.
B000FGGE68|4.0|Milla Jovovich is another of those actors who inspire me to watch whatever they are in.  She was great in [[ASIN:0800195175 The Fifth Element]], and everything else I've seen her in; [[ASIN:B000YPUFAQ Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray]]].  However this film is not quite as intense as her usual butt kicking flicks.<br /><br />I would not sell my copy, and the cover alone is worth keeping, but I cannot give the film five stars.  I like it, and Milla Jovovich is always sexy but the this is not on par with Resident Evil, etc.  Regardless, you don't see my copy for sale on Amazon.  ;-)
0374280967|5.0|\\"Small\\" only because THE UNCOMMON READER is very short. But \\"wit\\" it surely is. And \\"dry\\" certainly. How could it not be, from the man who was one of the intoxicating \\"Beyond the Fringe\\" quartet all those years ago, the man who has given us everything from \\"The Madness of King George\\" to \\"The Lady in the Van,\\" from \\"The History Boys\\" to the wild Maggie Smith film \\"A Private Function\\" to \\"Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet\\"? Bennett has written about a great many peculiar and distinctive women, but none quite so literally unique as this \\"uncommon reader.\\" I'm dying to tell you more, but that would be cheating you.<br /><br />Here's what will happen: if you are an occasional reader, you will probably enjoy the book, get half a dozen smiles from it, and find it the perfect companion for a flight from, say, Atlanta to Dallas. But if you are an addictive, lifelong reader, you will close the book and think at once about which of your friends you must tell about THE UNCOMMON READER right now. And hereafter, you'll get a wry grin on your face every time you think of England.
0393327655|5.0|This book is an excellent take on the absurdity of religion and its power to render a dull, mind-numbing, irrational, and uninspiring view of the universe. Even for an atheist and an aspiring physicist as me, the last chapter was truly interesting on the mystery of consciousness. The man is clear-thinking and smart as can be.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This film was a five star science fiction experience for me. The (Full-Screen) DVD box set is an excellent transfer and includes many extras about the making of the movie. The story of Kubrick and his relationship with Spielberg is covered in some depth.<br /><br />The plot was originally discovered by Stanley Kubrick, who in 1984 contacted Steven Spielberg asking him to direct the movie. Although they discussed the story at great length, Spielberg did not actually work on the film until asked to by Kubrick's wife after his death.<br /><br />It might have been Kubrick's greatest film as he worked on the story and details of the plot obsessively for many years. Spielberg attempted to make the film a tribute to Kubrick by reproducing his visual style. It is, for better or worse, a Spielberg film. Personally, I believe the film lost out in certain areas and gained in others. I am glad that after so much of Kubrick's dedicated work the film was brought to the screen by a great film technician who tried to incorporate some of Kubrick's style. If you care about children passionately bring plenty of Kleenex. Also, a great job was done by the entire cast.<br /><br />I find sci-fi movies that deal in a serious way with \\"conscious\\" computers or autonomous robot developments especially fascinating. I have also been waiting (with considerable disappointment) for the development of AI and a fully autonomous humanoid robot. Although chess master IBM's Big Blue and HONDA's humanoid bipedal robot, ASIMO, have been two noteworthy developments, I have been waiting for at least 50 years and still continue to wait.<br /><br />By the way, for those of you interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), please be advised that Amazon markets a DVD box set which discusses a related subject, entitled CONSCIOUSNESS. Although consciousness and intelligence are, strictly speaking, defined as two different things, they are loosely related when applied to machines.<br /><br />I do have some minor questions though that may seem trivial on the surface, but why would such a well thought out film make obvious omissions like the following?<br /><br />David was an almost perfect duplication of a loving child, but:<br /><br />1) Why did the writers have him incapable of the most simple body functions which have already been provided for in modern \\"doll\\" technology?<br /><br />2) Why did the writers not have him provided the ability to eat, drink, and eliminate associated waste products?<br /><br />3) Why would Teddy know that \\"You will break\\" when David did not realize that fact when he ate?<br /><br />4) Why did the writers have David's facial features curl downward and become immobilized when he ate?<br /><br />5) Why did David's immersion in pool water also result in his becomming immobilized? He was fiber optic and would not have short circuited. Even watches are water proof.<br /><br />6) Why did David become so dangerous when he met Dr. Hobbie and his brother under the skin, another David unit?  He became more violent than his actual brother when he met another copy of himself, smashing his robotic brother David, with no regard for anyone but himself. This was a very ugly moment in David's behavior.<br /><br />Were the story consequences of the above decisions necessary for further plot development? I don't think so.<br /><br />I know that these details have nothing to do with the emotions evoked by the film which were wonderful, but I can't understand how such a group of talented writers who worked on the script could let these minor \\"errors\\" occur.l on the surface, but why would such a well thought out film make obvious omissions like the following?

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Amazing!My wife could care less about bluray until i put this on, our mouths hit the floor!
B000059XUO|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  It is kinda like Batman, The Dark Knight, only more heavy metal.  If you like the new darker Batman movies, you're gonna love the Crow.<br /><br />\\"It never rains forever,\\" is my favorite line.
B000TSIK14|5.0|I had no idea Scorpions had a new album. One day, listening to the radio I heard \\"Humanity\\" and that was it, I was hooked.   The rest of the songs are just as good, the whole album is emotionally charged and full of energy.  I ended up buying three copies, one for myself and the other two as presents.  I love the way the CD starts, the way it ends and everything in between.   If you ever liked Scorpions, you will like this album.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I swore off Wal*Mart years ago and unfortunately it's the only place this cd can be had, at $11.88. While the music is awesome, I just can't get past that exclusive deal with the evil empire that is Wally World.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Ranks right up there with the greatest shows.  For a fictional show, remarkably educational (even Rove admitted they got the inner workings of the white house and government correct) - high on entertainment, high on educational value.  The box set is nice, if for anything they switched all the discs to single sided.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I wish that everyone would take the time to watch! What a masterpiece! Ive never seen a more realistic portrayal of the beginning of this country.  I have a new appreciation for the men and women who gave so much so that we could live as free as people can. Many thanks to the writer director and actors.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the best show Sci-fi has had besides Stargate SG-1.  It's a shame there's only one season, but it was worth buying.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Not much you can say about this product other than that it is simply INCREDIBLE.  Everything about this set is amazing.  The PQ is outstanding and the AQ is great too.  This is definitly a must have Blu Ray set for any Blu Ray owners out there.
B000002JST|5.0|everyone should own and listen to this cd.  it is some of ac/dc's best work.
B000SEGCRS|5.0|I got the kindle edition and I have enjoyed it very much, filled with great info!
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite top 3 movies.  I saw this when I was a teenager, and it wasn't the crude humor or bizarre situations discussed in the flick that drew me in, it was the incredibly witty writing that Kevin Smith is now famous for.  The film is totally spoken script driven, so if you are looking for a Stallone-type action flick, go elsewhere.  This movie launched Kevin Smith's career(and shot for only $30,000!) and watching this movie clearly shows why.  Probably wouldn't want to watch it in front of Grandma, but a great flick, none the less.
B000K7VHJQ|4.0|This was a very good and powerful movie! I cried when Jesus was crucified, and I'm not the teary guy when it comes to movies. I just wish it had more character development of Jesus' disciples and the healings Jesus did.     Overall, I thought it was spiritually-moving. I think this will be the only masterpiece for many generations!
B00003CWOL|5.0|Being Catholic(as Kevin Smith is) I found this movie amazing.  Aside from the movie being excellent, Smith says common sense things about Christianity in this flick that most of us thinking people wondered all the years we have sat in the pews. Yes, this movie will probably offend you if you have strict beliefs about the unfaltering authenticity of The Bible.  However, if you have any sense of humor at all(and realize that even Biblical writers weren't perfect) you will probably enjoy this movie.  I don't really see this as a Jay and Silent Bob flick(although it definitely is) as I do a religious satire.  I need to get my priest to watch it.  I bet he would enjoy it.
