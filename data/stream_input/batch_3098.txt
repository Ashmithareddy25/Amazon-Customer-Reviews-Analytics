B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has returned to his roots -- not just because he has written a great sequel to The Shining, but because this book reminds me of the books he wrote when he cared about the story, the characters, and the book and not the money he was going to make off of it.  If you are a Stephen King fan, then you know what I mean.  There have been so many of his books I have purchased just because it was written by him.  So many books that I would force myself to read but hated from beginning to end.  This book reunites his soul with his writing -- yes, it is that good.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, but let me start by saying that at first, I hated what King had Danny become.  I had always imagined another way that Danny would have responded to the experiences he suffered when he was young, but let me say right here, I was wrong.  As I forced myself to read the first few chapters (because of how much I disliked Dan), in the end, it was all worth it.  The reader has to see how everything he went through, all his life experiences and his decisions affected him, and how it ultimately helped him to grow into the person he needed to be.<br /><br />One note of caution -- do not expect this book to be the sequel to the movie, The Shining, because it isn't and it shouldn't be.  That movie was a bad imitation of a great book.  If you have only seen the movie, I highly recommend that you buy The Shining and read that first, although I suppose Dr. Sleep could be read as a stand alone book, but it brings it full circle if you have read The Shining first.  I was lucky and caught the sale that Amazon had on the kindle version of The Shining, and rereading that book reminded me of just how scary a book could be.  Especially since I needed that reminder as the same can be said about Dr. Sleep!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.

0066620996|3.0|Review of the Book<br />Good to Great<br />Why some companies make the leap and others don't......<br />By Jim Collins<br /><br />Jim Collins, III (born 1958, Boulder, Colorado) is an American business consultant, author, and lecturer on the subject of company sustainability and growth. Jim Collins frequently contributes to Harvard Business Review, Business Week, Fortune and other magazines, journals, etc. He is also the author of several books like: Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies, Good to Great (2001), How the Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In (2009) and Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck - Why Some Thrive despite Them All (2011) etc.<br /><br />The Book Good to Great is a research project done by Jim Collins and his research team in 1996. With 21 research associates working in groups of four to six at a time over a period of nearly five years, the study involved a wide range of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and examined 1,435 Fortune 500 companies.<br /><br />This book addresses a single question: \\"can a good company become a great company\\", and if so, how? Based on a five-year research effort, comparing teams that made a leap to those that did not. Good to Great shows that greatness is not primarily a function of circumstance, but largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline. They think the transformation, as a process of Buildup followed by Breakthrough and it further broken into three broad categories - Disciplined people, Disciplined Thought and Disciplined Action. Within these three stages there are key concepts like Level 5 Leadership, First who... then What, Hedgehog Concept, Culture of Discipline and Technology Accelerators. Wrapping around this entire framework is a concept that calls the \\"Flywheel\\" which captures the gestalt of the entire process of going from Good to Great.<br />This research is finalized with twenty eight companies which includes eleven Good to Great companies andseventeen Comparison companies. He shares the three reasons for only eleven companies make the cut. First is they used a very tough standard as their metric of great result, second, the fifteen year sustainability requirement is difficult to meet for a company and the third is they were looking for a very specific pattern: sustained great results proceeded by sustained period of average result (or worse).<br /><br />There is a brief introduction about all the above concepts that included in the flywheel. So the first is ...<br />Level 5 Leadership: Level 5 leaders look out the window to attribute success to factors other than themselves. When things go poorly, however, they look in the mirror and blame themselves, taking full responsibility. The comparison CEO often did just the opposite - they looked in the mirror to take credit for success, but out the window to assign blame for disappointing results.<br /><br />First Who then What: The Good to Great leaders began the transformation by first getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus and then figure out where to drive it.<br />Confront the Brutal Facts: In this concept they talked about Admiral Stockdale who gave the Stockdale Paradox which says that the \\"Retain faith that you will prevail in the end, regardless of the difficulties\\" and at the same time \\"confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be\\". Leadership does not begin just with vision. It begins with getting people to confront the brutal facts and to act on the implications.<br /><br />Hedgehog Concept: The hedgehog concept is to not a goal, strategy, or intention; it is an understanding. To go from Good to great requires a deep understanding of three intersecting circles translated into a simple, crystalline concept (the Hedgehog Concept): one circle denotes what you are deeply passionate about? Other represents, what you can be the best in the world at? And last circle stands for, what drives your economics engine?<br /><br />Culture of Discipline: A culture of discipline is not just about action. It is about getting disciplined people who engaged in disciplined thought and who then take disciplined action. Discipline action without self disciplined people is impossible to sustain, and disciplined action without disciplined though is a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />Technology Accelerators: The good to Great companies used technology as an accelerator of momentum, not a creator of it. None of the Good to Great companies began their transformations with pioneering technology, yet they all became in the application of technology once they grasped how it fit with their three circles and after they hit breakthrough.<br /><br />The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: There is a phrase, \\"Revolution means turning the wheel\\" - By \\"Igor Stravinsky\\". This concept simply says that if you diligently and successfully apply each concept in the framework, and you continue to push in a consistent direction on the flywheel, accumulating momentum step by step and turn by turn, you will eventually reach breakthrough. It might not happen today, or tomorrow, or next week. It might not even happen next year. But it will happen.<br /><br />When all these concepts come together, not only does your work move towards greatness, but so does your life. In the end, it is impossible to have a great life unless it is a meaningful life. And it is very difficult to have a meaningful life without meaningful work. Indeed you might even gain that deepest of all satisfactions: knowing that your short time here on this earth has been well spent, and that it mattered.<br /><br />And at last they specified that the Great companies are easy to find but Good to Great companies are much rarer because many companies show a sharp rise for five or ten years with a hit product or charismatic leader, but few companies manage to achieve fifteen years.<br /><br />That's all about the Book \\"Good to Great\\".<br />Thank you
B00CEF014E|5.0|I would expect great things from this author in the future.  He has a psychological writing style that pulls you in, putting you into the mind of the character and leaving you feeling as if you're living her nightmare with her.<br /><br />Dana Barnes voluntarily checked herself into a psychiatric facility to help her deal with mounting depression.  Released after five days with few options of where to go she decides to join her sister at The Rainbow Collective, a private community of  environmentalists.<br /><br />Trouble begins almost immediately for Dana upon leaving Expedition House. A fight with her boyfriend who suddenly disappears without a trace.  Even worse, Dana has no verifiable records that Tyler ever existed, except in her mind.  Arriving at the Rainbow Collective alone she seeks to enlist the help of her sister and local authorities in find her missing boyfriend as she struggles to settle into community life.  But the community is full of secrets.  Secrets that Dana knows she has to uncover if she's going to find Tyler and save his life.<br /><br />It's difficult to write more without giving spoilers, so I'll leave it here.  Solstice is a psychological thrill ride that will keep you guessing all the way to the end.  As a mystery fan, long time reader and author it is very difficult for a book to throw a twist at me I didn't see coming--this book did and I absolutely loved it.  There are some sharp POV shifts that may disturb some readers, however, I love multi-pov books and did not find the book hard to follow.  I will definitely be looking for more Stevenson books.

B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I am, or rather, I was, a huge Stephen King fan. I've read every book he's published. But I couldn't finish this one. I overlooked the occasional poor story. I overlooked the nagging sense that he let his wife write a couple of stories and published them in his name.<br /><br />But I can't overlook, in Dr. Sleep, the casual and callous references to the cowardly terrorists 9/11 attack on the US, or the way too often use of the profanity GD. GD this and GD that. Like the book was written by a junior high kid who just learned to curse.<br /><br />I won't be finishing this book, nor will I be buying any more from this once great author. His best days are certainly way behind him. All good stories come to an end. It's past time for King to retire.<br /><br />I used to say that Mr. King would never be recognized as a master because of his overuse of profanity. I guess he decided to prove me right.<br /><br />Flame on fanboys, I used to walk in your shoes.

B008JFUO0Y|1.0|If you enjoyed this review, make sure to check out my horror film blog for more reviews at: brandoncsites.blogspot.com<br /><br />Evil Dead (2013) *<br />D: Fede Alvarez<br />C: Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, Elizabeth Blackmore<br />P: Remake of the Sam Raimi classic about five teenagers who head to a remote cabin for the weekend, only to become demonically possessed one by one after one of them unwittingly unleashes evil spirits.<br /><br />Part of the objective of a remake is to retain the spirit or essence of the original while updating the story. With that in mind, Evil Dead is yet another pointless remake in an era of pointless remakes. Evil Dead’s objective is to throw as many buckets of gore at the screen in an effort to try to camouflage the overall weakness of the script and the flimsiness of the characterizations. Gone are the sense of dread and the anticipation of horror. Gone is the maniac camera work of the original. Gone is the piercing use of sound. Gone is the humor. All that’s left is a film that wallow’s in gore, violence & excess, but it does so without any originality or gusto. Evil Dead is the kind of film that doesn't have a voice or anything in particular to say. [R] 91 mins.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|I read the reviews when film first came out and now that I've finally seen it (checked it out from the library), I found it wasn't that bad, I'd describe it as average. The biggest weakness is the story is too thin. The director has been knocked for the movie but I thought the directing (except for one shot which I'll mention later) was fine. It was a professionally made movie, scenes were in focus, the CGI adequate, not the best I've seen but okay. I liked Will Smith's character, he played what reminded me of an african amercian military Mr. Spock, a stereotypical unemotional officer with a tiny hint of humor (more underplayed humor would've been nice). His acting, as usual, was good. The son character, Katai, played by Jaden Smith, is a very nice young man and I thought Jaden did very well, except for one scene at the end of the movie where he sees that his father, surrounded by medical staff, has survived; at that point, where the director shot the General's hand in closeup, and shot that sequence in such a way as to tantalize the audience about whether the Will Smith character survived or not, Jaden should have done something, bowed his head, a small smile, something to indicate his relief and happiness that his father survived, but Jaden didn't react. The director should've gotten that shot, when the final movie was put together and reviewed, someone should've pointed out that very important missing reaction, especially considering that theirs was the main relationship on display in the movie, and that saving his father was Katai's primary job.  Other than that missing shot, Jaden's acting was okay - pretty solid for a 14 or 15 year old. Jaden is relatively inexperienced and needed a very knowledgeable director; the director hasn't had a major success in a while, so he was too tentative, not confident enough to tell Jaden what he needed. Their collaboration wasn't awful, and was mostly good, but had Jaden been more experienced and the director been more confident, the audience would've gotten a much better story. I disagree with the poor reviews Jaden got. I think he just needs to act in alot more projects and watch alot of films with a wide range of actors. He's got the chops, just needs more experience.<br /><br />The major problems in my opinion were the writing of the Katai character, and how late in the story the monster appeared. Katai needed more to do, he was not proactive enough when he was first introduced into the story. Yes in the end he saved his father, yes he survived and activated the beacon, but the audience needed him to do more, so I think the problem was with the story and it's structure. A teenager and his father take a trip, there's an accident leaving the father seriously injured and the teenager has to traverse dangerous terrain to get help. The story is too thin, there needed to be at least one other element to give Katai something more to do, someone else to help, perhaps even another person to help him.  Katai needed someone else to care for, in addition to saving his father. The other problem was the Ursa monster. Monster in this story didn't make an appearance until the final act, not enough time for the audience to perceive it as a threat. A comparison would be in Jaws if the shark hadn't appeared until the final act when it destroyed the boat. What if the shark hadn't taken out the lady swimmer, or the kid, or attacked the other characters. Well it would've been jaws-lite, a movie without the shark until the third act. Such a movie would not have kept people out of the water and scared the be-jesus out of them for years after.<br /><br />Another thing, why would a giant eagle-like creature attack Katai presumably to feed it's hatching young, only later to save and sacrifice itself to keep him warm? Not believable that a wild animal would do such a thing. So really, overall, I'd say the script was the problem. Had Katai been given enough to do and had the audience been given more informationabout him when he was first introduced into the story, it would've helped the audience attach to him. As presented, Katai proved himself to be courageous and ultimately successful, and it was fine to show he possessed those characteristics, but the audience needed more to help them attach to him. Would've been great if the writer had created situations to highlight that he was resourceful. Running for your life doesn't make you resourceful in a film, all characters run for their lives when physically threatened if they're able to. Resourcefulness is something a hero/heroine in an action adventure needs to demonstrate to get the audience's attention.  When a writer makes their lead character resourceful, that means the character will be proactive, do something, be unpredictable and by extension, interesting. Katai was too passively written and by that I mean the writer didn't create enough opportunities to display his strengths.  Saving his father occurred in the 3rd act, he needed mini successes, mini jobs, along the way that occurred in the 1st and 2nd acts as well. He needed other characters, his interaction with them would've given the audience more chances to see and subconsciously judge his heroic nature, helping us to respect and admire him. The writer did not provide those characters or those needed situations. And whoever approved the final script did not know enough about story to understand that crucial elements were missing.<br /><br />A comparison, Luke in Star Wars: A New Hope. By the time Luke was working to rescue the Princess while he was trying to escape from the Death Star, the audience already loved him. Why? Well Luke was a good kid, he stayed and worked on the farm helping his aging and not altogether healthy relatives (his uncle was limping in that movie if you recall) though he wanted passionately to leave for school. And speaking of that, he wanted schooling, something most citizens agree should be a child's birthright. Also a birthright, knowledge about your parentage, which his uncle was clearly withholding. So Luke was being denied his birthright. And though he was frustrated by his uncle, he still obeyed him, taking care of the robots, who, by the way, he treated courteously though they were slaves. Luke was liked and was being rooted for well before he engaged the Empire. And the villain, the Empire, was one of the first elements on screen, and the audience saw what they were capable of and it was obvious they were the bad guys. And as to resourcefulness, Luke was able to talk a resistant Han Solo into helping rescue the Princess, and he also got Leia across a bridge using only abit of thin rope. Katai needed other characters, other situations, to demonstrate his resourcefulness, to help us see him as a young man of value, and help us attach to him, and that attaching needed to be done before he began his quest. For the audience, Katai's successful journey on the hostile earth should have just validated audience emotionally backing him, but the backing (attaching) should've been done by the time he regained consciousness post-crash. The writer emphasized the father/son dynamic, and there was nothing wrong with that, but we needed more than that, we needed more from Katai's point of view, as he is the story hero.<br /><br />So that's why I think the film wasn't as successful in America as it might have been, but I think it did well enough worldwide. Grade: 2 and 3/4 stars, rounded up to 3.<br />P.S. Considering Jaden Smith has only been in what maybe 5 major films or so, I think he's got the makings of a good actor. And it doesn't hurt that he's handsome.  I hope the Smiths keep trying and develop more features for their children. I'm African American and I definitely enjoyed seeing a family of African American descent in a futuristic film. Well done Smiths. Not too bad Mr. Director.<br />P.S.S. Just remembered that I also liked that the music didn't hit me over the head being overly dramatic. I prefer a light touch in big movie music cues, and got that here. Also liked the ladies acting who played the mom and the daughter.

B00CEF014E|5.0|Wow! This story unfolds fast with just enough enticements to keep you going.  Once you think you have it figured out here comes another surprise!  Solstice draws you into the mystery and keeps you there to the very last page.  I think Dana is believable and makes an interesting main character. We are introduced to her knowing she has mental disorders, but Dana is not your average victim and Solstice isn't your average mystery story. Great read!

B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I have to say I was hesitant in ordering this CD because the last Christmas one that I bought a couple of years ago just was not very good (at least in my opinion).  It was recorded in a cathedral and the acoustics must not have been very good.  The music was just too loud for Susan's voice and I felt she was drowned out.  Not so with this CD!  Susan's beautiful voice is superb on this CD, the music is beautiful, and the arrangements are great.  I was a bit taken back by the \\"duet\\" with Elvis Presley and Johnny Mathis (more by Elvis than Mathis).  This seems like a bit of a ploy to me get listeners but I do have to say that the mixing of that song (O come all ye faithful) is flawless and Mathis' \\"duet\\" is done with the song \\"When a child is born\\" which is one of my favorites.  I really do like The Little Drummer Boy rendition with its strong bass.  I also like the clear vocal tones on \\"Bleak Mid-Winter).  So, I am really glad that I decided to get this.  It reminds me of the joy I felt when I bought her first CD after her initial discovery and meteor rise on the Internet.

B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Last weekend this went wildly on sale, and I missed it.  I spent a couple of days convincing myself I really didn't want to read it, that I wouldn't like the obvious Harry Potter rip-off, etc., but I was wrong.  I was immediately sucked into this book, read it in one day (I think I ate lunch today, who cares) and loved it.  I loved Cath, I loved her struggles, her passion, her weirdness.  Levi is awesome.  Her roommate is awesome.  The book was full of people trying their best to be their best self.  I personally love when someone has a passion that takes over their life (in Cath's case, writing fanfic) to the point of obsession.  I think it's great when someone is so into something bigger than themselves.<br /><br />The best thing about this book for me was how accessible it was.  Someone else described it as the anti-thesis of every other NA out there, which I think is accurate.  I liked the main character.  I was rooting for her (inside joke, read the book).  I didn't want the book to end.  What else do you want in your escapism?

B00ET47USI|3.0|Cards are too small for me, but I need new glasses: ) I like it better when the finished suit trails away rather than instantly disappearing.  Still, it is a cute presentation.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|this record is an intelligent and modern artistic progression for the arcade fire, which is something they always seem to achieve with each new release.  there are so many nuanced layers to the production, that it is quite likely the best-produced album they have made yet.  however, although i do like this album and appreciate everything it accomplishes, and also admire the arcade fire for constantly finding new creative territories to explore, this album does not find itself amongst my personal favorite albums of theirs.  like i said, they are constantly finding new territory to explore, however as far as my personal preferences are concerned i have more of an affinity for the territories they've already mapped and charted than the one they are currently in.  still a very solid and impressive album though.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Had to read the other 13 books again when this finally came out but did not mind it at all - loved the series.  It is well written, complex, and not easily predicted which held my interest.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series I have seen in a while. The acting is great. The story lines keep me wanting to know what happens next and I loved the way that Season 2 ended. I won't say much more as I don't want to ruin it for someone who is still watching.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read Gillian Flynn's books in reverse order.  This first book of hers was as good as her others.  The story moved quickly but allowed time to get to know the characters.  Love the troubled lead and her bad decisions and her broken humanness.
B0055SWM08|3.0|It is fun at first, but you end up needing more coins if your a perfectionist.<br />It gets boring if you can't figure a level out.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Part 1 in the Clifton Chronicles.  The story of Harry Clifton, and the Barrington family.  A real saga spanning quite a few decades.  At the end of book one I could not wait to get started on the second book in the series.  I don't want to put any spoilers, but this is a real page turner, and I could not put it down.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Long time fan of Allie' s blog and the book captured and magnified the blog's genius completely. She has a way of illustrating these existential human truths in the most simple, but profound ways. Also, the dogs are stupid adorable. Finally, the book ends on a spectacularly poetic note that made me so happy.<br /><br />N.b. I read this on my Kindle Fire and the colors\pictures looked great. I have no idea how this measures up to the print version though.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|HORRIBLE PHONE CASE. I have had the case for 6 days and by the 2nd day, the back showed many scratches and today the entire back plastic piece has rippled. DO NOT BUY.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Regretfully, this is a good crew of actors in a film that is so full of holes.  I'm so happy I did not pay to see this movie in a theater.  The plot line is thin.  The true magic of the movie is watching it and then asking myself afterwards, &#34;What was this movie about?&#34;.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Say goodbye to your in grained negativity bias. This book can change your outlook on life if embraced. Happiness first and success will follow.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought and it didn't download and I kept on pressing install and it wont install now so that why I give it 1 star
B00F2HW20M|5.0|I just watched the 5.1 surround sound dvd and feel like I just time traveled back to see a concert I never got chance to see. I know most people only know the more pop machine Genesis headed by Collins....but for me this era, the Peter Gabriel era, was what, and will always make Genesis an amazing band.<br /><br />Steve Hackett is an amazing guitarist. He could dazzle and go for total flash if he wanted, but instead he always seems to do what the music needs from him. I guess you'd call that discipline. You should seek out his solo works, especially his most recent. But here he has done an amazing concert honoring Genesis. I didn't love every special guest performance. The Lamia is one of my quirky favorites from The Lamb, and the lead singer was just a shade off to me....but still in come that final guitar solo, one of the most haunting and dramatic guitar solos I have heard in my life.<br /><br />His band is great. The drummer usually sings in his other concerts and does a great job each time. The singer covering Peter Gabriel channels him well, and even sound  like him, more on other songs than others. It was a tough act to follow Peter, but he holds up.<br /><br />Anyway...I almost didn;t buy this because I have Steve Hacketts other concerts on DVD already. I'm glad I did buy. I love everything Genesis did up to and including Wind and Wuthering (the two albums after Peter left. Many state that Genesis lost it after Peter Gabriel left....while other claim it was after Steve Hackett left. After hearing this, Clearly Steve was the last thing holding this era together.<br /><br />Get the set including the DVD. You need to watch this too.
B00A27X972|5.0|This was an absolutely beautiful novel. It is told by someone &#34;not human&#34; as the narrator who discovers humanity in a way I didn't before realize I needed to hear. Sure it's abstract in some cases, but that's the beauty. It's told from a perspective that is alien to what your default beliefs are. The character goes through growth that forced irreversible changes upon them that requires them to step outside the cell that imprisoned them before in neutrality. It exposes humanity in its naked unbiased purely &#34;logical&#34; form and does it well. I'd recommend this book a thousand times but I will forewarn anyone reading this that you must be both open minded and semi intelligent to understand the concepts and ironies within this tome. It is well worth it even if you aren't these things to read this book as it opens up perspectives you never thought about before, or if you have as I have, it gives dimension and detail to them. Humanity is both beautiful and disgusting as a whole and even individually, but there is a purpose and there is a reason for both occurrences. Mainly, you can't know true beauty without its polar opposite which stands true for all things one treasures in life. Love is nothing without knowing hate. Happiness is inconsequential without knowledge of sadness. So on and so fourth. Well written, well done and thank you.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I had downloaded this game on my first Kindle, and since I enjoyed it so much, I decided to download it once again. I was on level 219 with 8,650-some coins, all of the puzzle pieces were found, and all  of the toys were collected. All of a sudden, my Kindle dies, so I went to plug it into the charger, and leave it till the morning. I go to turn on my Kindle, and open Coin Dozed, where it reads, &quot;Level 1, Coins 40&quot;. The game had reset itself. All I want to know is what happened? I love this game, I reccomend it to all of my friends, but after that incident, I'm not sure I should.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am having it for 6 months now. It was good for the most part. Two things I have noted is that the device gets heated too quickly when I touch it and also I noted that it does not work well with Chrome browser in PC..If the internet speed is slow then it gets struck and I need to reset the router..I am OK with it because it is still in beta(Chrome Browser in PC).
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle has the most beautiful voice and some of the songs on this album were sung with Johnny Mathis whose voice was so complimentary on those songs.  I always treat myself to one Christmas CD per year, so glad I chose this one.
B0050OMJIW|1.0|Awful. This book is one of those classics where you get to the end, breath a sigh of relief and find yourself somewhat bemused as to why it is so highly rated.<br /><br />All of the characters are objectionable, the dialogue is stilted, the scenarios completely unbelievable and the underlying cynicism which drives the plot development is nothing short of childish.<br /><br />I persevered for no other reason than to have reached the end, hoping that I would be able to find some redeeming feature; in the former I was successful, in the latter I was not.
B0064W652A|5.0|From its great plot to its intriguing grahics, Batman: Hush is the ideal batman comic for the fanatic. Great in color!!! Cant wait for more.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Really enjoyed it, avoided most of the cliches from zombie fiction although they strayed a long way from Romero's classic zombie rules.<br /><br />Zombies that run??? How would the body's biology support and fuel that?<br /><br />What I enjoyed was the lack of paranoid &#34;marauder&#34; crap that gets written into so many of the genre.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|I think this is personally the best album yet from Trivium, and I like all their albums before this. This really shows how much of a great singer Matt Heafy can be without having to use the screaming/grindcore.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre at his cynical best. You won't be disappointed, and be sure to be prepared to finish however late you may need to stay up. The ending is quite unfair, but could you expect any less?
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|A great album, just like demon days (I bought that one too). For some reason, I can't stand the track &#34;sweepstakes&#34;... But that's just me. A great concept album too! NOTE: the one I received came in a sort of paper cd case, this is most likely a statement against the problem of dosposability that the album attacks. Think about it: if plastic beach is about how disposability is a problem, wouldn't it be hippocritical to have the cd case mostly plastic? The cd was is new condition as promised and it plays great while driving to school or work!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It is a great series.  Well crafted plot with enough twists to hold viewers interest throughout.  Well paced. Slows down to emphasize a point or build a character study of individuals. Speeds up to ensure the overall pace does not slow to the point of being boring.  Well acted by entire cast. No weak links. Acting fits in well with the characters portrayed. In many movies/series the audience usually can think of actors that would be a better fit in portraying the character on screen.  In this series,I cannot think of any actors that would be better suited for the roles that are portrayed. Both the female leads show the emotions they are feeling in both facial expressions and body language. If the young lady playing the daughter continues to excel in the manner she is currently pursuing she will have an outstanding career. And of course Damien and Mandy do an outstanding job; this is quite obvious.
B00082IJ08|4.0|The album was new and packaged as promised, but it did have some scratches on the cd case even though it was sealed. *shrugs* well the cd is from 2005, so.... Other than that, all inserts were there and the disc was perfect! Overall a great purchase and now I can play it in my car on the way to school or work!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Overload of gratuitous nudity in the first 10 minutes (a real turn-off to start), crash scene that I thought was going to redeem the rest of the film, but really tanked after that. Not a character you end up liking at all, so couldn't relate or empathize with any of his shenanigans through any of it. How is this a &#34;thriller&#34; when there is ONE SCENE that is thrilling. And it isn't even a climax or anything. Denzel can do better. All that tooth-sucking drove me crazy. Watch it you'll see what I'm talking about.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Looking at some of the &#34;bogus reviews &#34;like  mark twain .. Gimme a break .. Bezos .. Great man like Steve jobs .. Just a genius .. Ty Jeff for creating amazon.. Don't really care about all the bs .or your private life . . Jeff. Bezos just a visionary .. Genius.  Bravo Jeff .. Keep going baby .. Can't wait to see what's next..
B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|Avril fans have long loved her pop punk vibe and this has surely become her signature sound. And while this album certainly keeps that tradition alive, especially with songs like the first track &#34;Rock and Roll,&#34; it seems that she delves into some other musical styles a bit as well.<br /><br />As Lavigne has grown from a teen into a woman, she has also grown as an artist. The lyrical content ranges between everything from her classic rebellious punk vibes to more sexy, sensual sounds and rather serious, deeply emotional subject matter.<br /><br />I rank the songs as follows:<br /><br />1. &#34;Rock N Roll&#34; - A+<br />2. &#34;Here's To Never Growing Up&#34; - A<br />3. &#34;17&#34; - B+<br />4. &#34;Bitchin' Summer&#34; - C<br />5. &#34;Let Me Go&#34; - C+<br />6. &#34;Give You What You Like&#34; - B+<br />7. &#34;Bad Girl&#34; - C+<br />8. &#34;Hello Kitty&#34; - C-<br />9. &#34;You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet&#34; - C+<br />10. &#34;Sippin' On Sunshine&#34; - B+<br />11. &#34;Hello Heartache&#34; - C+<br />12. &#34;Falling Fast&#34; - B+<br />13. &#34;Hush Hush&#34; - B+<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this album to long-time Lavigne fans as well as those who might be interested in seeing a different side of this pop punk princess.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I adored all of Fielding's previous books and couldn't wait for this one to come out. It is painfully bad. The witty Bridget the younger years is gone- replaced by a blathering, brainless ditz. There is no storyline, and nothing redeeming about the book-- struggled through half of it before I finally gave up-- waste of time!
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|Just doing something the way it's always been done is revealed, rightly, as nonsense. Fried and Hansson take us inside their lair for a chat, one that offers us street smarts, and helps to free us from the idiocy of programmed, plastic behavior. Nicely done guys, and thanks.
B000W9399S|5.0|It's taken me awhile to get around to reading Pratchett, but I'm very happy I finally did. I haven't laughed this much since one of Douglas Adams' novels. This book is a wonderful blend of fantasy and outlandish humor. To give you an idea of the humor, one of the running gags involves a treasure chest that can eat people. You quickly get an idea of the type of humor with his initial description of the world as a disc carried on the back of Great A'Tuin... a giant turtle.<br /><br />Rincewind - far from even a &#34;good&#34; wizard by his own admission - gets wrapped up in more than he can handle when he encounters Twoflower. Twoflower is perhaps the first &#34;tourist&#34; in Discworld, seeing as the only people that typically travel far are traders and heroes. Yes, the book has &#34;heroes&#34; as well as gods of various levels and abilities who play a game. Although I'm sure the concept can be found in many other books, I liked Pratchett's portrayal of life as a game with all of us being pieces used by the gods. It's not a comforting thought in the least, but here it's done in a very funny way with the gods getting frustrated by one another and the regular people occasionally hearing sounds (&#34;like bones rolling&#34;).<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that the pacing at times is a bit uneven. The characters suddenly skip over a bunch of encounters that are vaguely alluded to. However in general I found it very entertaining and well written. His use of words is often witty and very colorful.
0385537131|5.0|John Grisham hits another home run again. This book arrived when it was promised and as usual grisham doesn't disappoint
B00BSBVJVE|4.0|I first learned about the adorable fat cat Pusheen as an online blog, so when I saw there was a book of his own coming out, I couldn't wait to take a peek. It's adorable, and just so fun. It's the perfect book to put a smile on your face when you it the most.<br /><br />The book is done in comic book block style. For readers who are not familiar with Pusheen, there is an intro section, but hey, Pusheen has similar attributes to other cats we've known and loved. She is lazy, sleeps a lot, eats a lot and can get into some unusual situations and trouble!  Pusheen also has a younger sister named Stormy who gets into the act as well.<br /><br />Although this was very fun as an eBook, I suspect that this one would be even better in print. It would be great to be easily be able to flip though the pages when you needed something to make you smile. Take a peek; it's not just for cat lovers.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|very cool movie. a complete surprise, brad pitt is excellent, the story lie is believable, well shot, not a walking dead on the big screen
1594204217|1.0|Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation by Michael Pollan, The Penguin Press, 2013, 468 pages. [[ASIN:1594204217 Cooked Natural Transformation Michael Pollan]]<br />This was a birthday gift from my daughter. It was a pure delight to read. Pollan does his research, writes elegantly and teaches me things I didn't know and hadn't thought about.

B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Very solid performance put together, yet once again by Eminem. A couple of songs that I can skip over but other than that I am very satisfied with the outcome of this album.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a calculator and this was one of the first ones I looked at.  I'm sure I could find cooler ones out there, but it worked for what I needed to do at the time (and just about everything else I've used it for since the).  Why try to fix it if it isn't broken?
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|I loved this book. It is long story and the author repeats some of the information in order to make sure the reader is up to date on who did what to whom, but it is a rich, entertaining read. The story centers around a number of crimes committed by a group of people all of whom are related somehow to a dead man. It takes place in the 1800s gold fields of New Zealand but it really could have been staged anywhere..<br />  The writting is subperb. Catton paints a picture of the people and their surroundings that is so clear and inviting that I had a problem putting it down to go about my everyday iife. Her scenes are as vivid as watching a television show. And the plot, the most vital part of any book, twists and turns like a roller coaster. I could spend pages giving out cudos on this master work, but why take the chance of ruining the story . All I can say is highly recommend this book

006202406X|1.0|Wow. Roth ruined the whole series. This book is absolutely horrible. It is boring, dull, and seems quite lazy at times. I was super excited after finishing Insurgent to see what is &#34;outside the fence.&#34; What we find is uninteresting, boring, and too informational. Tris and Four's characters change in this book. Tris into arrogant and a know-it-all (totally unlike the Abnegation attitude she had in the first two books) and Four, strong, confident Four; becomes a whiny brat. I could not believe the way Roth ends the conflict in Chicago. Four's evil mother just turns away from her life's work? Four's maniacal, evil father just bows down to another woman?<br /><br />Finally, Caleb had a chance to redeem himself. There is NO WAY that Roth should have let the story end with Caleb not saving Tris and dying for her. But, no instead you end it with SPOILER!!!!! Tris dying for her brother. Stupid. A waste of a story. A waste of a movie. A waste to all the loyal fans out there. I'm super disappointed and will not be watching the movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Of the 40 or so books that I read in 2013, this was probably the best.  I loved the main character's quirkiness and confidence.  In fact, all of the characters were incredibly well developed, especially the author of the main character's favorite book.  I sped through this in just a few days as I couldn't wait to read what would happen next.  I was literally sobbing out loud after finishing this book, and despite being such an easy read, it was very thought-provoking - especially thoughts of the existentialist nature.  I can't wait to read the rest of John Green's books.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is amazing it has gotten my kindle fire working better than ever it is awesome I love this app
B0089EHWQE|5.0|As with all of the Moyes books I have read (Last Letter from Your Lover, The Girl You Left Behind), this one left me wrought with emotion. This book is very engaging, and definitely an easy read - great for vacation, travel, etc.  This is basically the book version of a top-notch chick flick.  Not incredibly mentally stimulating, but emotionally moving and you really do come to love the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay, is one of the best books i have ever read. If anyone has a problem with that then you just aren't smart enough you really have to think through the book. I hope whoever didn't like this book re reads it.

1439127727|4.0|For anyone who is interested in politics, and has viewed the animosity between the candidates during election time, it is fascinating to see that once the candidate is in office, he realizes that the only people who can truly understand the nature of the job is someone who has served in the past.  The interaction between President Truman and former President Herbert Hoover was especially fascinating, considering the criticism that had been heaped on Hoover.  To see also that former President Clinton and former President George H.W.Bush became fast friends after they were put on a common mission to help Haiti after the earthquake was a lesson in how people change once they are not more or less required to mistrust each other in public.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Cher at her best...<br /><br />A touching and tough movie... that's rare<br /><br />This really is a good movie, Cher is a wonderful actress<br />and Eric Stoltz is amazing, at the time he played this role<br />he was just a teenager... he just totally took his acting ability<br />to a different level...<br /><br />Sam Elliott - not to take away from his great acting in this movie,<br />makes a handlebar mustache look hot and that is something....<br /><br />This movie is based on a true story and the actors really<br />have done this justice.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I just received this mouse today, and already I am 100% satisfied with the decision to spend the extra money and get a gaming mouse! There are many functions on this mouse to allow for easy use for in game options. The side buttons where your thumb rest are the ctrl/shift/alt keys, to avoid from having to use the keyboard, freeing up a hand for gaming situations, which was nice, I simply was under the impression it was a key. I would recommend this product to any gamer!

1400095204|5.0|Adichie's novel is perhaps one of the best novels I have read, and her writing is so beautiful and descriptive that I feel her work has already become timeless.  Reading Half of a Yellow Sun not only painted a beautiful and sorrowful picture of Biafra and Nigeria, but it also convincingly brought the reader into a realm of genocide as best as one can do in a literary work.<br /><br />Genocide does not simply happen overnight, and Adichie's slow build to tension and uncomfortable rhetoric through word of mouth, radio, and witness to events provides the perfect set up for the plot.  The reader gradually becomes familiar with the delicate nature of ethnic tension between the Igbo, Yoruba, and Faulani in Nigeria.  It is not until Olanna leaves her safeguarded world in Nsukka that ethnic violence becomes apparent.  Still, it does not seem probable to she and Odenigo's eyes that political activity could descend into a form of violence inconceivable to humanity.<br /><br />Adichie's treatment of the Biafran Genocide is painstakingly thoughtful.  Of course no one wants to read about children dying slow deaths, but Adichie's portrayal of the starvation that grips Biafra is necessary, because we know these facts to be true.  It absorbs the reader into the then-current feeling in Biafra, thus enhancing the reader's situational awareness.  Too often, people know nothing of the violence in Africa; Adichie's earnest writing style helps to change that, by not only bringing a fairly unknown historical event to light, but to do it in such a way that readers can somehow identify and / or try to understand feelings of helplessness, loss, and anxiety in a war-torn setting.  Food is a universal love, and Adichie so excellently portrays the grueling discontent and disbelief of the food shortage that ultimately touches every human in the region.  Additionally, her continual reference to radio and other forms of public outreach (billboards, word of mouth) help paint a picture of propaganda, fear, and hope that all take place in wartime.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|It was listed as riveting...I don't feel it was. Not real happy with it turning out to be more of a rhab movie.

B009XY97VC|5.0|This is the only music I have ever bought and kept every single track. They are all worth listening to unlike some albums where some of the music sucks so bad you have to delete some of them.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|For anyone who is thinking about purchasing this book: please read it within a certain scope of flexibility. This book is not going to have the ending that you may expect, and it's better that you go into reading it without thinking that it should end a particular way. Most of these low-star reviews feel as if they are sourced from an opinion about how this series should have ended, and I don't believe that evaluating this book based on that is giving it an accurate or fair chance.<br /><br />That aside, I thought this book was amazing. I have read a lot of dystopian teen novels thus far, even popular ones, and this book surpassed all of my expectations. The world and the details within it are fleshed out just enough to allow the reader imagination over the setting, and the emotions and personalities of the characters have a strong element of realism.<br /><br />My biggest issue with Veronica Roth's writing style is her inability to make each POV distinct from each other. This is a general weakness of first person, and if the possibility of characters being indistinct turns you off, you may not want to read this book. I found myself often going back and hunting for some sort of way to distinguish Tris from Four/Tobias, and sometimes this even went back to the beginning of the chapter where the POV was titled.<br /><br />At this point, I'm going to go into the *spoilers* of the novel, so you are warned.<br /><br />I believe that Tris made the best choice possible for everyone involved - the choice that DEFINED her, which was a running theme for the entire series. Yes, Tris died, but she chose that path. If Caleb had gone through with it, there was no guarantee that he would have been able to accomplish what she had, and Tris would have regretted it for her entire life. Her choice was very in character for her, even if it included sacrificing herself.<br /><br />Everyone makes choices that define them in their lives, and as an adult reading a young adult novel I thought that the conclusion of this series had a very important lesson: choices can result in great sacrifice, but sometimes they are necessary. Sometimes, forgiveness is necessary even for the most terrible of betrayals. And sometimes, walking forward and never looking back has to happen.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am thoroughly pleased with every cent that I put into this series. Every book was worth it, even with its weaknesses. I'll be continuing to watch out for Veronica's work, and I hope to see more from her in the future.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Maybe since I am not a game player may be the reason for not understanding this game.  What are the rooms for?  What does it mean by charging?People receive credits.  Can you spend them?  Just need help.
B000025H0Q|5.0|Very good.  I already had the other two Nick Drake CDs, so I bought this to complete my collection.  It is not as sparse as his other works, which can be considered good or bad.  I have enjoyed it and think that is is worth getting.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Nothing spectacular...but not awful.  Movies have just become a little bit too predictable to receive 5 stars.  There needs to be a bit more to impress me that much.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I ordered this 2 days ago and got it today. It's exactly what I needed for my tenth Doctor costume for the 50th Anniversary special.<br /><br />Cons: Other reviewers are right about the pen nibs. They just kind of pop on and off, not very securely. It would be nice if the attachment would screw on and the cap pop on and off, but it all just kind of pops together...if you want to uncap the nib to write you have to hold onto the nib attachment while you pull the cap off. That's really the only issue I have with it.<br /><br />Pros: Its a good size; 7inches at normal length, then 8 1/4inches when extended. The light is nice and bright. There are 4 different sonic sounds, including the most recognizable sonic hum.<br /><br />Overall, I am ecstatic to have this new prop. It's absolutely perfect for any whovian, especially Ten fans :)
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|This was cute, but again nothing incredible or stand out really.  I'm not really a huge Nicolas Cage fan, and until writing this review I didn't even realize he was in it...I guess they did a good job hiding him or maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|The quintessential day in-day out of politricks. Kevin Spacey is indispensable. Script is unbelievably well crafted. Bring on season 2 to add to our collection.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|This wasn't as good as the other Iron Man movies.  It was pretty and predictable.  The visuals were impressive...the story was bland.
B00915G6R6|5.0|Awesome acting and script writing. Have the entire collection, can't wait to get Season 5. Love the brilliant ensemble - exceptional.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This is one of my daughters favorite movies ( 4 yr old).  She loves the horse and that Rapunzel smacks people with a skillet.  I didn't fall asleep through it the first two times watching it.  Like all children's movies, I just bought it, because she will watch it to death.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Greta physics game. Challenging and absorbing. This game has a surprising number of levels. The fun keeps coming and coming!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Both the Munchkin & I like this movie.  It's cute...it's made her ask me if she can go to college and she's 4....so anything that makes her think she wants to go to college is welcome.  I have yet to fall asleep through this movie and we watch it a LOT.
B00F031X62|5.0|My kind of album: not too long, clean bass heavy mix and the singer in high spirits and good voice.<br /><br />I am not the Hendrix expert to really get into these grooves but let me say, plainly, that this formerly vaulted effort represents the best of 1968 rock and 1968 blues. no disrespect to B. B. King or any of Jimi's idols still making hit singles and albums, at the time. FOXEY LADY and FIRE (two takes each) and I HEAR MY TRAIN A-COMIN' with HEY JOE and RED HOUSE as set-bookends shock this fan of 44 years.<br /><br />I wrote above he did the best of Rock and Blues...don't mean to shortchange S-O-U-L!<br /><br />Super set supported by excellent booket with colour<br />images.
B0060CREHO|5.0|I still cry when Dumbo goes to see his Mommy in elephant jail and she is swinging him in her trunk.  Saddest part of the movie because I can relate to the willingness to accept the consequences for protecting my Munchkin.  I'm a sucker.  My 4 yr old daughter loves the movie too and has learned that it's not nice to be mean to people just because they are different....this movie helps reinforce that.  Classic movie!
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is a fun game keeps my mind agile. Easy to play and I like a challenge so it will be fun to try the different levels.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Love this CD - you can tell that TT put lots of heart and emotion into this set.  I've been a fan of Susan for years, but with the addition of the Trucks band -the music has gotten even better.
B006WZIC5C|5.0|The MOFI vinyl is sublime. Quiet flat surfaces, and great mastering. Five stars across the board. Worth every penny.<br />There are some new vinyl mono pressings out there that are cheaper on Sony that are nice too and are a bit cheaper.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Could be one of the greatest TV series to ever have debuted on Television.  WOW, does AMC have it going on right now!  Walking Dead coupled with &#34;Hells on Wheels&#34;  Great Job AMC!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this on Facebook and was beyond excited to see that it is now available for my Kindle!  Game plays great too!  Thanks Amazon!
B000002L99|5.0|bought for the wife as she loves vanhalen. not really much to rate here. if you like them u get it, if not you dont. kind of stupid to even rate a cd
B008JFUNNM|4.0|\\"Captain Phillips\\" is an action/thriller biopic genre film, which examines the hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of the ship's American captain Richard Phillips. The early narrative presents an interchanging perspective from both Captain Phillips and Abduwali Muse who was the leader of the Somali pirates. Thereafter the film contains many tense scenes and the quality of acting by the entire cast takes the viewer there with plenty of raw emotion.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I could not put this series down. It keeps you guessing at every turn. Not normally into this genre of books, but I am now hooked.
B007HJ9NBE|1.0|Terrible remake - stick to the original, it's much better.  Nothing more needs to be said but this feedback tool requires it.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Worked perfect for a bracket to place my license plate onto my from fairleads on my Jeep winch! Great product!
0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon's books are always most interesting ....<br />Full of intrigue !<br />I find them hard to put down when reading them.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Once in a while, a cinematic effort yields a masterpiece.  Breaking Bad bears the most essential elements of it's genre.  Offbeat concepts, perfect casting, strong actors and detail bring this creation to a boil.  A must-see series.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really like this game. Should definitely check it out. One reason why I don't like this game, what frustrates me the most though, is... I have a mission. To supply the depot 4 times. Supply it 3 times. BOOM!!!! Storm comes along and wipes it out. Make all the stuff I have to, take all this time, fix it. BOOM!!!! Another storm comes and destroys my depot before I could supply it. Get all the parts, more time wasted. Fix it... TORNADO!!! Yup.... The depot........  I just wanna complete this mission and I feel like u want me to just feed money into it which I won't do because I do not have spare money to be throwing down the drain on little electronic games...  And for that I give you 4 stars.. Help me spare some time and frustration and fix that kinda stuff, then I'll think about giving you the 5 stars I think you could very well deserve. Buts that's only if you fix the bug.....
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I was working on a writing assignment and I went to email it to my teacher and I couldn't! I had to put it in a folder and attach it to the email but then I lost it!?!? The document is gone!!!!! Waste of money!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They need to update the game because it's still Halloween when it should be something else! Please Update The App! Halloween is over!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book pulled me in and never let go!<br />I was just looking for a quick read and never realized this great adventure of life and death that i was going to be taken on! Totally worth reading.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I downloaded it because it was a classic. On the first reading I was confused by all the characters and that most of the book is an unannounced flashback telling, but after rereading I really enjoyed the creativity and unrequited romance of the plot.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I thought this was a great series. Each book had something different to offer and they all added upon each other. I highly recommend this series. The books include enough magic for the reader to believe it was possible and tied the two worlds together well.
B00C7607BC|3.0|All Though The Shipment Experience Was Excellent, The Little Mermaid Two-Disc Diamond Edition Did Not Have A Slipcover, Very Disappointing, Now I Have To Get A New One , Not Cool Amazon  :(
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I enjoy most of Nicholas Sparks books and this one was no different. I read the book after the movie came out (but I hadn't seen the movie) so I had Zac Effron in my mind while reading this....which was nice. It is true to the author's style of writing and had me wanting to fall in love all over again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Although I am not a game player, I do enjoy playing Candy Crush Saga. I would rather NOT pay to play. However, I do understand that business is business.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read this on the heels of 50 shades of Grey and there are a lot of similar themes in the two books, which was expected. I thought it was an okay book but I haven't read the other two because of the way they supposedly end. I guess I am tired of that specific genre of book.
B005NQ5LQ4|2.0|i thought this was a new version and purchased it, but found it is one I already have, but the<br />cover had been changed, the other had Sammo Hung on the cover - was very misleading
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed this book until the very end. I was so pissed how it ended that I deleted her other books out of my &#34;wish list&#34;. I also told other people not to bother reading it because of the ending. If the ending went how I wanted it, I would have given the book a higher rating. But with that aside, the book was entertaining and kept you guessing about what would happen next. I hope the movie is better (and I hardly ever say that).
B0068FYZLG|5.0|Enjoyable and shows acceptance of blue collar father to something<br />very different in his son's love of ballet and support he shows him
B004H1V5RU|2.0|I understand the name is Perplexus Epic howver they should have changed it to Perplexus Unrealistic. There is no fun in a challenge that is impossible to complete. I have completed one of the other Perplexus mazes but this one requires maneuvers that defy gravity and momentum. It's a great concept but unfortunately the &#34;Epic&#34; version will be collecting dust if I even decide to keep it that long. I am not saying that if I can't do it, nobody can, but I am saying that the skill required is only surpassed by the insane luck you will need to complete the just the first third of this puzzle. Buy it and try it and you will see what I mean. I seriously doubt even the makers can complete this challenge.
B00847KFDS|5.0|He is singing with a variety of different people and was very enjoyable.  It shows the diversity of<br />his music
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is a beautiful story. As a parent it warms your heart. I read this to all my kids. And get teary every time
1476727651|5.0|Excellent read from start to finish couldn't put it down. A stand alone story even if you haven't read or seen The Shining, highly unlikely, you can enjoy this. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Stephen King or just likes a scary novel.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is the best thing for online information always send you to the right  thing who every made this thank you so much for making this online search
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Great noir-style teen detective series. I love that Veronica is not a shrinking violet.  Her relationship with her dad is arguably one of the most interesting and touching aspects of the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game everyday. I can never stop!! But it's an awesome game that really gets your brain working.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Thoughtful and engaging book that people of both sexes should read. It's great to hear about the mistakes and insecurities from Sheryl's days before she was uber-successful, and I think it's great she's taking such an interest in helping other women to get there.
B000099T2L|5.0|VERY GOOD MUSIC ALSO I LIKE HER SINGING.<br />AND WILL LOKK FORWORD IN GETING HER CD S<br />MORE AS TIME GOES BY.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this journey and with every page I learned more and more of the Igbo culture and the tug between Black Americans and Africa.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|It is just an ok game.  The kids really did not get much into it!  They have only played it a few times and now it is just waiting for it to be deleted...
B00902AKK4|5.0|It's terrific to have a FAOTD that isn't the same old shoot-em-up yet not so sweet that your pancreas spasms during play.  Beyond Ynth has the required &quot;story &quot; yet it doesn't overwhelm the game.  Basically you help a bug collect gems and dodge acorns by applying some logic, luck or the right combination of buttons.  If you get stuck, there's a handy in-app link to You Tube cheats.  Good game, lots of fun!
B00EKR61FM|4.0|Having never owned any Twilight movie I waited and waited until I would find a box set that can do justice to the saga. I never thought I would fall for the Twilight mania but I guess I got sucked in also. My girl loves the box set I purchased for her. However the only downside is how difficult it is to remove a movie from the photo album. A few scratches are already visible without even watching the movie one. Luckily the bluray movies have more durable scratch proof than normal standard dvd's. I definitely will recommend this to anyone looking for a set that doesn't break the bank. You also get the movies on UltraViolet which is pretty cool. I gave it 4 stars since the movies are really difficult to  remove from the album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm so glad I decided to read this series. Book one was a little hard for me because I had watched the movie,so I knew the out come. I loved this book! Great ending. I can't wait to read book three!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not only is this a very exciting and extremely fun game, it is also very challenging, and unlike the other games out there that are in this genre. Love it!!!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|watched this long time ago. Always get it out on Halloween to watch it. Each time I watch it its just like the first time, scary.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Gary has decoded what most couples spend years trying (and often failing) to understand about their significant others and themselves.
B000641D2Y|5.0|have viewed it and remember it so very well. a million laughs. still need to get the first Home alone
B0010HA68I|1.0|The clips which latch to existing straps come undone way to easy and if you have something valuable attached to them it will ruin your day!  Beware
B00005O5CM|5.0|Love the story and have sequel already on DVD so now I can enjoy them both on DVD. Haven't watched the Ist one yet but will soon
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love that Zynga made this game available for the Kindle!  I saw it on my friends phone and really wanted it.  The graphics are absolutely fantastic!
B00CO4GO7I|2.0|Not particularly well written. Not nearly as interesting or exciting as Lone Survivor. Portrays a certain &#34;kill-em&#34; mentality which is often prevalent in the military well but one with which I have trouble embracing.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Amazing read. provided great insight. I'm glad I took the time out to indulge!<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone.
B000G75994|5.0|Excellent interpretation; recording is OK.<br />Some sonatas were recorded in Hamburg whereas the remaining sonatas were recorded in Lisbon. Two different recording locations blended into this set may cause some to hear the sonic differences.
B008M721MS|5.0|An AWESOM way to keep in touch with family over seas-:)<br />My sister would not call me unless she sees me...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works well, easy-to-use. Sometimes you want a game that doesn't require much concentration, like when you are watching TV. This is perfect.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this movie.  Funny and cute.  I love the littlest girl in it.  She's so adorable, but the minions rule.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  It will show you four different pictures and you have to come up with the word that they all have a connection to. It will keep you busy long past your bedtime, so be warned. It is that fun!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love love love this book.. will be re reading the series again and again!! Christian Grey is amazing. Would recommend anyone looking for a good erotica love story to read these books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent game! It kept a grandma and a sick 7-year-old entertained for hours! Just can't stop - we're hooked for life!
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This is a great game.  Good graphics and controls. It's possible to have lots of gaming with no iap. I wish they had more battlefields, but the ones they have are good. I sometimes have connection problems, but it could be my router. It's FREE!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Favorite keyboard for my phone that I have found.  Nice to have voice recognition option as well as swype option
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|as much as I thought I loved the show before, this season blows season three out of the water hands down
B00AKKS278|5.0|Often times the most profound advice is the simplest. What I have always needed is to be spoon fed the formula and know what work I need to put in to get the desired results.<br /><br />While Hal's book isn't a ground-breaking new theory, it tells me what exactly I need to do to form lasting habits and positive change in my life.<br /><br />It's up to you to put in the work to become who you want to be. Hal has given you the perfect road map to follow.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Been looking for a tactical tcg for awhile and finally found this. Great graphics and runs smoothly in my kindle fire I highly recommend it.
B001ECDVKE|3.0|So, you've lined  up all these stars and are paying at least one mega-salary to Jack Nicholson, and, presumably, good money to the other lesser Big Names, what are you going to do with them. Make a satirical movie. Make a comedy to show these stars are down to earth funny. Well, I can't even imagine what went on after that, but, whatever it was, it produced A very mild comedy that needed the Stars to draw people in on their names. (I interrupted my writing to check out what Wiki had to say about it. No surprise. It was a relative failure in the United States after innumerable rewrites.) None of them warranted inclusion in the cast for their contribution although a few were able to produce an occasional real laugh. Still, if you like Nicholson, and who doesn't for something he has played in, you might want to see him play two roles here. Martin Short, does inject some humor despite his lines and there are bits along the way that lighten the proceedings. Sylvia Sidney was a travesty of an  old lady in a way that might well earn disrespect from the elders-if the film had been good enough to be taken seriously. So, it is not an unbearable picture to sit through. It has its funny moments and some good satirical ones. Of course, given the nature of such things, many people will hold things funny which only make me groan.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I just love this movie. It's a great story about love and coming out when it's not easy. The acting is well done. Two thumbs up.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I am a sap, a great big blubbering cry baby!!!!! and I'm old....when I finished this book I cried like a sissy girl....This book was brilliant, clever, romantic and adventurous. This is the way you end a series that people love. This is exactly why I will always buy this author's books..because she gives her stories heart & soul, and knows what the story line and the characters mean to the individual reading it. Maybe Jennifer Armentrout should mentor a class on how to end a series, her first pupil can be Veronica Roth.
B0052REUW0|5.0|Excellent review of the history of violence from a perspective I haven't seen elsewhere. Pinker marshals the evidence to support his theses in a very persuasive way. As a bonus the book is also fairly well written.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Very fun &#34;line them up&#34; game. Really enjoy the animals and the funny captions in between. Kids would probably love this because of the animals really fun!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I love star trek so its kind of hard for me to be critical here. Perhaps more behind the scenes footage would make it better.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Pretty fun, it does get a bit wordy in the captions between games. Some of the items are hidden well and I really had to look hard to find them.
B0041KKYCY|1.0|To be truthful, I thought I would enjoy watching this movie from reading the reviews. I kind of like the revenge action type movies. But, in this case, I just did not get any enjoyment from the movie because of the way the lead character was treated (I don't want to give anything away).<br /><br />I must be one of the silliest people on earth as I ended up purchasing part two of this movie. I didn't like it for the same reason. Action movies are my favorite type movies but not in the way proposed in these movies.<br /><br />I threw both movies in the trash.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was extremely excited when I ordered my ChromeCast, and think that it is a brilliant idea at a great price point. As mentioned in previous reviews, the installation was super easy, and took no more than 10-12 minutes.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that there is definitely some lag at times between the computer screen and the chromecast, and at times it would simply disconnect from the computer and I would have to reset it. It may be the internet connection, though I have the fastest TWC offers at the moment.<br /><br />Overall, I still think it's a really convenient and cool product, but at times it has been slow with the connection.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I like the actor playing the male lead, as well as the fact that this is one of my favorite Austen books.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This album is great! He's a genius when it comes to playing with words. Love the sampling on this album.
B007HJ9NBE|5.0|Awsome movie can't say it enough great music and dance very thought out and props to the director and cast
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is an excellent book with great advice.  It presents information that diverges from the conventional and accepted medical and dietetic advice.  The advice given really works.  I am working with it and have achieved rapid control of my Type II diabetes to the degree that my doctor is amazed at my results.  I am a retired physician and I thoroughly endorse this book.  Buy it and read it and heed it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game I love the graphics in this game. It's a real time consumer. I just wish I could earn coins quicker
B000IHSKUM|4.0|So I went in to a store and the told me I'm a size 12 for Keens. They checked with other keen shoes and it seemed like a good fit. This one fits a bit too correclty for me. I would have liked it to be a tad bigger....<br /><br />But otherwise VERY COMFORTABLE ... amazing sandals
B0078XFYDA|2.0|Very disappointing read. Just a simple rehash of basic knowledge available to anyone with a high school library card. Nothing magical between the covers of this little book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game it is the strategic pattern in the level as you go through the levels they get actually harder.thanks!
0770437400|3.0|I don't normally read books with this subject matter, but this one really interested me. World War Z is not written like a normal novel. It is collection of first hand accounts and interviews from survivors of the Zombie War. It is made up of several sections including before , during, and after the Great Panic aka Zombie War. Alot of the book contains interviews with military personnel about training and gear improvisation. Due to the way this book was written, it makes a Zombie War seem all too plausible.
B004JVXTL8|5.0|Gr8 episode in a gr8 series. Takes PA 1s creep factor and cranks it up, setting the back drop for 3 and 4. you wont be disappointed with this buy
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Truly informative about a great time in music. A well done documentary about a place most people have never heard of.
B000J025AE|5.0|good revamp of the original. I frequently watch this movie. never disappointed by it.  would of been nice if fergie would of made a acting debut as a survivor.....before she drowned
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of my favorite reads. I recommend this to anyone who likes this type of book. Really engrosing.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|because we cant be separated by petty differences anymore. Its our independence day. yOU should already have a copy anyways
B009JU5I9U|5.0|As a confirmed foodie I am always looking for new ideas...Recipes are wonderful....Ottonleghi has a way of putting together ingredients that<br />I would not have thought of...and it works!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Helpful. Great for relisting an item that did not sell. Just sucks that Amazon didn't include a universal printing app for the Kindle Fire HD! I'd have no use for an actual computer/laptop...if I could print from my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Anyways, back to this review. The only problem I'm having with this eBay app is that I've noticed when an item sells, New bid comes in...or Best Offer it's slow with the alerts. Other than that, it's a fairly good app.
1573226521|3.0|For the first time, I'm actually glad I watched the movie before I read the book. And not just saying that because it starred Leonardo DiCaprio. I was on the beach where the movie was filmed whilst reading this book.<br />Alex Garland's original version was a much darker tale of miss-adventure in sun soaked Thailand. Corpses on the beach in Koh Phangan and a mysterious new character Jed were nowhere to be seen in the film. In fact, the most scandalous scene would be the sex scene with Sal, which was not in the book.<br />Richard was impossible to like. His obsessions with vintage video games and Vietnam movies seemed to contradictory for a person who is willing to go native on a deserted island. He was weird, the loser kid in school no one wanted to play with. Etienne and Francoise, who I thought to be interesting, exotic characters, were barely in the story, cropping up every once in a while to ensure the reader didn't forget about them.<br />Basically, it was the worst parts of the characters, their personalities and habits, amplified until your head explodes with into tiny paper lanterns burning across the sky in Thailand. Sitting on the actual beach, feeling the sand between my toes and the sun on my shoulders, occassionaly looking up expecting Leo beside me in Phuket, did nothing to bring some intensity to this story.<br />It was very bland.
B0055S348W|4.0|This ap works great on my Kindle Fire HD. It can be a little tricky to lern at first but I am not a coputer wizard and I was able to figure out how to get it up and runing in 15 min. It works as advertised with my Canon wireless printer<br />and seems to offer a variety of possibilities, most of which I may not need. For printing email or web based items this program is hard to beat. I would give it 5 stars except for te ease of use being less than optimal, though still quite acceptable.
B00DKY4NBA|4.0|this took over 2 weeks to ship but the album itself was in mint condition and was packaged very well. the music, on the other hand kind of fell far from my expectations. this album is a lot more lacking and bland compared to other Arctic monkeys albums. it isn't as fast paced and upbeat. it is a lot more slow and easy-going. there are a few songs that are catchy to me, but nothing really &#34;wowed&#34; me on this album in particular. i bought this vinyl for my cousin's birthday and she loved it! it was perfect for hew new turntable.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Happy with the device overall, once i got it working again. Worked fine initially, then didn't. Had to reinstall for some unknown reason. Hoping that doesn't happen again - very frustrating.
080701429X|5.0|Not finished with it yet, but it just reaches out and grabs you to pull you right into the situation with him.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Who doesn't love the late 90's with all of its awful clothing and angsty music. Well I absolutely do and this gives me every dramatic moment of being in high school right alongside Joey Potter and Pacey Whitter.  I love this show and this complete series was a great addition to my collection!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is great I finally got in touch with my dad after 13 years<br />Awesome way to keep in touch with a friend or family member
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved! Definitely had me engaged throughout. Great read! Too bad I finished it so quickly...or maybe I just wanted more
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I watch movies just for entertainment. Once you get technical it isn't fun. I love action films, Toni and Don Cheadle are great hero's, funny, entertaining. I love entertaining films.
B00A83075M|3.0|The movie wasn't as good as I expected it. However, it was not bad, and is worth a watch. Basic plot line and likeable characters, and a few funny moments.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I love star trek! Its Scifi who doesn't love Scifi with action. Great film, lots of action, good guys and bad guys. The good guys when. Love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging as expected. Wish there were more floors, but it was free. I'll keep playing if there are more floors. I guess you can't expect much more from a free game.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Suspense and action are some of the best films. This film has you guess a little bit. Throws you a surprise at the end, not expected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome my friends always take my tablet so they can play subway surfers and I also like the new Halloween update
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Its a sad film, he has been playing a lot of depressing roles lately. It was just okay for me.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like this game a lot. But shouldn't the Halloween costumes have ended by now. It weird seeing the characters in costume past Halloween. So could you fix it. I love the game otherwise. You might also want to cut down on the canterlot ponies I mean their too expensive.
0345803485|5.0|Great quality and great price for the book instead of buying it for 15 dollars in the store!! No rips or signs of use.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I did the experiments and didn't get any results. Some of them were just plain stupid and she really didn't do a good job of explaining the point of them, for instance counting the number of cars of a certain color, that you see. I guess what she was trying to convey was that you have to look for the good things in life and then you'll be more aware of them?  This book was highly recommended, but I got more out of small ebooks I've purchased, like &#34;Happy Money&#34;, &#34;200 Powerful Affirmations&#34; and &#34;How I made over $1 million dollars using the Law of Attraction&#34;
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The screenplay was a successful adaptation of the novel.  The casting was mostly spot on, and the acting was believable and talented.  The gore was kept within bounds of decency.  My attention didn't wander throughout the film.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I LOVE this game I couldn't stop playing and the graphics are aswome I play the game all day and night I can't think of any other game u should get and best of all its free to download
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I know this book has gotten mixed reviews, but I loved every word of it.  If Helen Fielding wants to write Bridget Jones Enters the Nursing Home I would happily buy it.<br />Some readers have criticized Bridget for not seeming to get it together in the 15 years that elapsed between books, but that's just the point, isn't it?  Our interior dialogue is our interior dialogue, whether we're 18 or 30 or 51, and some of us seem to float through our daily tasks with Martha Stewart-like effortless perfection and others of us are so very...Bridget-like.  That doesn't change.<br />So bring on more Bridget, at any age and stage of life!
B00902S0IS|5.0|Outstanding use of the film tech of the times to make a REAL science fiction movie,<br /><br />Very, VERY young Anne Francis and Leslie Nielsen opt in to make this one of the seminal sci-fi movies - ever.
0062107313|5.0|And relish the journey...for Ms. Tan takes you on an exploration that amazes all the senses...THIS is a great read...
B008Y7BE7E|4.0|From the introduction of the &#34;rules&#34; to the ending, very well done. A cameo of note and  a nice ending make this a &#34;gotta have&#34;.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A really quick read!!! Could not put it down. I loved all the books. This final chapter in the series was excellent!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Thanks so much for writing this book. It will become Christmas presents for many people on my list. I needed to read this. I have been trying to go gluten free for a few months. It is not easy with society the way it is but I feel a new resolve to do it. Excellent information presented in terms that I could understand with a no medical background....Now if I can just get my husband on board! Thanks!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game that challenges you. It is fun and is a excellent time consumer. I like how they have lots of level.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|It's an entertaining, action-packed film, with your favorite action heroes, cheesy lines and lots of explosions and special effects. It's good if you like these kind of movies, just don't expect Award-winning performances.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|What a stupid movie. Apparently, if you have enough special effects you don't need anything else. I actually paused the movie for a couple of hours to watch regular TV. Sure, this would be good for a 10 year old boy, but really dull for adults.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem,sometimes misunderstood,often troubled,usually controversial,but always damn honest sincere and never shy about his emotions. My life at times felt and was very similar to Marshal,so at times his music has helped me say a lot of what I wish I could. Sometimes he said things I didnt want to hear but needed. I am no Stan,and I dont have a troubled relationship with an ex,I often got along exceptionally well with all my past loves,but Eminem has been an identifiable figure since I first heard that first rap bout the Real Slim Shady. It opened me up to listen to more. I have owned every cd he has put out,have had my faves and my songs I could do without but he alwys had enough solid raps to make every cd a great buy. Version 2 of the MM LP continues his same proven and reliable track record of making a buy very worth every penny since there are plenty that will see high rotation in your playlist.<br />  Make sure you buy the Deluxe version,there are a few songs that are amazing that are not on the cheaper version and you will regret not having them. My absolute favorite song is Desperation. While it has the standard Eminem rap,it puts one hell of a twist to it that makes it something we have never heard from him and damn I love it. I have always been good in the past of listening to a cd right away and picking the songs that will be hits,this is one he could have never put out to promote the cd,but I gaurantee this will be one we hear a lot in the near future. The sound,the beat,the lyrics,I urge everybody to give this a listen and request it on your fave station,I really wanna see what kinda video this song will have so we all gotta rave about it so mtv or bet will get a video of this rap. Seriously...Desperation,if you dont know or dont give it a chance you might be taken by suprise.<br />  I of course am always excited bout new Eminem,after getting Berserk a few weeks back and its scattered and bizare lyrics I was a little worried,even tho I loved the beat I was a bit confused by the words. Now that I have the whole cd on my hard drive I gotta say those little worries have been put to ease. I also read the rolling stone story a bit ago,how naming this version 2 was not just a stunt,but that he wanted to put that same energy into this,he wanted that same quality that we got from the first one. It wasnt just done to sell a cd,he did it because he put that same love sweat and tears into it,he did it to really let the fans know this was gonna be the best he could do,that we could expect the same energy and effort,that we would get another cd full of amazing songs destined to be hits. Along with another reliable pairing with Rihanna for one track he put together a couple others to an amazing level along with plenty of his own solo stuff to make this cd everything he hoped it would be. Eminem,you did it again. I am impressed,and proud of ya. Mabye I am getting too old for this music,but I sure am not ready to give it up,and if Eminem keeps putting out this high quality stuff I aint gonna give it up till I am dead.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played the original Castleville on Facebook but this one is so much better. The story is fun, the actions are fun and best of all you don't just plant harvest repeat!<br /><br />I would definitely send invites to friend to try this one. I already have :)<br /><br />There are a lot of things to craft, there are several ways to sell or use crafted items and there are &quot;dungeons&quot; to send your heroes. You still have wait times (what game doesn't?) but there is no energy or mana that you have to wait to refill.<br /><br />I also like the graphics. They are cartoonish but not in a childish way.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun, entertaining and interesting time waster!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was a good book , it was very beautiful and I love how the book was so deep.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I have played this game on three different systems and every time I play it it seems to get more addicting.  Absolutely amazing.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|This movie was entertaining, and kept me on the edge of my seat. One of the few movies I see over and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY!! I have wait forever for candy crush on kindle.its such a fun game. hope its as good as it should be.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My 2 yr. old grandson loves this.  It is very easy for him to navigate.  It is a terrific learning tool for him also.
1449305172|5.0|Having an ambitious dream is great... but then where do you start?  What do you focus on?  Who do you listen do?<br /><br />I have a big dream.  One of those things that you think, &#34;I have to accomplish this before I die, no matter what it takes.&#34;  And I've been putting in all my free time to try to make it happen.  I knew I would need to work my way there and iterate, and to get feedback as I went.  But even though I was trying to learn on the way, I just wasn't learning the right things.  I'd get feedback that conflicted, and it felt like I was always being pulled in 20 different directions.  I was stuck in a cycle of continuously trying to make everyone happy.<br /><br />I love this book because it gave me permission to ignore people. To stop trying to make everyone happy, and to figure out how to make the -right- people happy.  Ash's advice: &#34;Don't lower friction, raise it.&#34;  It's counter intuitive, yet it's the wisdom that has made all the difference for me, and now I'm watching everything change.<br /><br />I started to work closely with just a handful of the right people.  I'm focusing on their success and ignoring everyone else.  Then others started to notice, and wonder what was different.  And now day by day I get requests from other people, interested in what I'm doing.  It's starting to sell itself.  And I couldn't be more excited.  Its the beginning of seeing my dream come to life.<br /><br />I'm so thankful for the practical wisdom in this book.  It gave me the structure I needed to find that early traction - even with a bold and ambitious dream.  To any reader out there who has a vision, Ash's book is a roadmap to help you make that vision a reality.<br /><br />Thank you, Ash, you're awesome!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's addicting, Once you start Its hard to put it down. Just wish I didn't get stuck for<br />long periods of times.
0500516766|2.0|This book is capably done, but I was hoping for it to be beautiful. It isn't. And I feel that this is an opportunity lost.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This was a great book! It was very well written and the dialog was quite witty.<br /><br />The only thing about it that might put off some readers would be the sex scenes. They were fairly graphic. It would be appropriately categorized as a fantasy romance novel with a strong plotline and character development. The author has a unique turn of phrase and a knack for describing her story well.
B004W2UBYW|1.0|I could not finish the book - I prefer reading about &#34;nice guys finishing first&#34;.  Mr. Jobs, was not, in my opinion a nice guy.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the blog Hyperbole and a Half, and I think the book may have been funnier!
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|The book was good but on one page, the letters were glitched up and scrambled every were weirdly so I would give this book<br /> 4 stars but the messed up page, it's down to 2 stars but other than that, it's a ok book
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Fans of the first two will be on the edge of their seats for the finale. To the less than die-hard readers: I acknowledge that the mechanics of the plot are a bit clunky. Refraining from too many spoilers, I suggest that perhaps the drama should have stayed inside the fence rather than getting bogged down by the new world outside of it. However, it is nonetheless a bold addition to the YA family, particularly given Ms. Roth's unusual (dare I say unpopular?) ending move. Readers might be interested to read interviews with her afterword to understand the choice. I know that, though shocked, I approved of the choice upon reflection, and felt the ending satisfied. Fans and newcomers alike will benefit from hearing the story from both Tris and Tobias's perspectives, which prevent their relationship from being reduced to formulaic YA fluff. Each one is a whole, if flawed, person with strengths, weaknesses, and independent agendas. Their respective endings demonstrate their growth as human beings. Highly recommended for readers who like emotionally challenging books and don't just read for escapism. If you're looking for substance in your YA adventure, you will find it here.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I read every one of Gladwell's books and this one is just like the rest of them: well written, engaging, thought provoking and simply entertaining! While he has lately come under some serious criticism in regards to the fallacy of his arguments, one cannot dispute his talent in being able to come up with profound arguments and being able to systematically synthesize various research literature to support them. I am always very excited about his new books and am already looking forward to the next one!
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Good, BUT it just ends without much of a conclusion.  Also as with his other books on Kindle the tables do not translate from print to kindle.  Also the footnotes appear at the end of each chapter necessitating going through several pages that have already been viewed.  Most of the problems are directly related to Kindle not To Gladwell, but the author should be aware and insist on these things being rectified.
B008U3NU38|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my husband, and I haven't seen him so excited about a gift in years. As he put it: any hardcore Clash fan would be stoked to get their hands on this box. It had plenty of material that could previously only be obtained as a bootleg, and plenty of extra goodies to prove his status as a Clash fan to anyone that didn't already know. Amazon packed it carefully and it arrived without a ding. The box is fun to look at and we keep on display in our living room (which also makes for easy access). Extremely pleased with this purchase.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|This was downloaded to specific mov files taken from a camera.  So far it is working well.  It does some instructions to get the videos listed in the app.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Pearl Jam is back and better than ever. As usual, the guys put together an interesting CD package, so if you're old school, I would definitely recommend getting the hard copy of this one. I absolutely love every song on this album. My ONLY complaint is having to limit my access to keep myself from tiring of it.
B00BSBVJVE|3.0|As a Tumblr user I am familiar with the adorable styling of Pusheen. Normally a Pusheen post means an instant reblog. So learning there was a Pusheen book did make me smile. The point of this review though will ask if buying this book is a good purchase for you.<br /><br />First I should talk about Pusheen herself for those unfamiliar with it. Pusheen is a series of mini comics  that are comprised mostly of minimal text but funny or adorable illustrations of the character Pusheen or friends. Pusheen is a gray cat that in the tradition of Garfield loves to eat and sleep. Though Pusheen does have her evil moments (I personally love Pusheens evil expression.) she nicer then Garfield.<br /><br />I love Pusheen. But I also must be honest in my review and mention that there is really no new content in the book. That did lower my rating a little. Now the question remains if you should buy it. I think it depends.<br />If you are the type who likes having cute, illustrated books in your home you may want to buy the physical version for your coffee table. There is also the fact you would be supporting a budding artist if you do buy either version. Please consider those points before purchasing or not.<br /><br />For the rest of this review and the rating, please check out Musekicker's Reading Place.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Takes some getting use to but still a keeper. Now stop asking me to review this game. I like it okay.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I am so happy to have another chance to live in Bridget's world - I missed her!  The humor and heart of Helen Fielding's writing is still there, and the story brings me right back to her earlier work with Bridget.
B000SNW0HA|3.0|Some of the songs are good, but then others sound more like parodies to electronic music than an actual song.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I've always had a hard time understanding exposure, because I wasn't so...bright. After reading this book as recommended by Ken Rockwell, I was enlightened :). It is such as great read having Bryan explaining everything from concept to techniques, easy to understand and it's something that I would bring it into fields all the time. If you are not enlightened after this book, try...a slower shutter speed, wider aperture and increase your ISO.
B00005NKK8|5.0|What is not to like? Love the movie, the soundtrack is even better! Lots of oldies AND goodies. Two words - buy it!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|“Doctor Sleep” is the sequel to “The Shinning” that Stephen King wrote back in 1977, and it follows the life of Dan (Danny) Torrance.  King did a great job of making the younger version of Dan into an unlikable character struggling with alcoholism like his father before him.  King redeems Dan’s character as the book continues, but some readers may not choose to stick around long enough to see because the book starts out a little slow.  Another turn off is King’s inclusion of some sexual abuse and physical abuse scenes involving children.  The sexual abuse was brief, and not integral to the story, but the physical abuse scene, while short, is a big part of the story.<br /><br />If you ever want to read “The Shining”, I recommend doing so before picking up Doctor Sleep because King includes numerous references to the first book, and he spoils a big portion of the story.  Since I read the two books back-to-back, it is clear that King’s style has changed over 36 years, and I found the sequel to be much less of a physiological horror story than the original book.  Neither frightened me, but I felt like “The Shining” had more frightening, edge-of-your-seat moments than Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />Without providing any spoilers, I thought the ending of Dr. Sleep was a bit too tidy.  Some people knock King for his endings, and I thought he made everything fall into place too easily and too quickly.  There was one interesting twist that I enjoyed, but overall I found the ending a bit lacking compared to other King novels.
B0000794F4|5.0|Cool cd!  Very unique songs that you do not hear everyday.  The lead singer puts his feelings out there and draws the listener in to each track.
B00FR0OHTS|1.0|11/06/13: I downloaded this album last night and ALL 19 tracks have a 1-2 second pause in between each track. I contacted a technician at Amazon last night and I'm sure they will get this resolved, but until then, I would suggest staying away from the MP3 version of this album. If this wasn't a live album it may not have been so annoying, but it really detracts from the overall experience of a live album to begin with.<br /><br />I am assuming this is not an issue with the CD version???
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Absolute best Camera bag money can buy!! I don't have 1 bad thing to say, I even bought a 2nd bad just for my GoPro cam and accessories.  Don't hesitate and don't try another brand, this is where its at!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|THERE ARE SLIGHT SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW -<br /><br />---<br />---<br />---<br />---<br />--<br />-<br />I absolutely loved this series and even put off a few assignments (I'm in college) to read them. This book was no different. That being said, that doesn't mean I wasn't depressed and empty when the book ended. This is not only because of what happened (as those who have read it will understand) but because the series is over. I am like this when all series end. The fact is, I do not feel that the majority of people who are not critical of the author and what she decided to do will be disappointed with this book. It is an interesting and page turning plot line, an amazing and heart wrenching love story, and has morals to truly be taken from this book. Though it is meant for young adults, college age and senior citizens alike will learn and appreciate the life lessons encased in these pages.<br /><br />I am still not over the tears yet (days later) but I know I will remember these books and will most definitely be reading them again in the future.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Totally enjoyed this love story. Her descriptions were vivid and couldn't put out down. It was engrossing from start to finish.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|poignant and beautifully written.  found myself underlining like I was back i college.  it is a book i will read again.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Simultaneously horrific and insipid in the same movie.  Could have been soooo much better and a half hour shorter!  Rev 13:4 People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, &#34;Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?&#34;
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Good to get a more accurate picture of the life of Christ.  Too many centuries of institutionalization of Christianity have distorted the real Jesus.<br /><br />Jim Pierson
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Practical and painfully realistic interpretation of potential Zombie apocalypse.  Rabies is the closest infection to so called 'zombie-ism' and it is only a mutation away from reality.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|Geography can be a tough sell with kids (and adults) but not in this app.  It is fun and very educational.  My daughter has just about mastered Stack the States and cant wait to start this one.  I have been playing and I am loving it as well.  Now when someone mentions Solvania or Djibouti I not only know where they are on a good day I may even remember their capital or their flag!  I also love how they keep the countries size proportion to each other so the kids get an idea of the true size of a country.  A very well thought out app that is a must have in my opinion!  I am running it on the original kindle fire, HD and HDX with no issues.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Such a well made and addicting game. Great job by the creators . Would give 5 stars if game allowed continuous game play but always fighting to get energy to keep playing game. Please fix that feature and this game would be a homerun. Definitely worth downloading.
B004L0NGEC|4.0|Very nice app. Easy to use and very complete. Only (minor) knock on it is it has some difficulties loading large pixel photos. Takes quite a while to open and give clear detail.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I love this movie  and good one DVD and love it and is my favorite since little thanks for bring it to dvd
B00C0ALZ0W|3.0|For someone who already works remotely it's not worth reading. I was bored as most of the things in this book are directed at larger businesses to convince them that they should let their employees work remotely. Some of the information is geared at employees and convincing your boss on taking the plunge. Overall I wasn't too impressed. It was an OK book for those who have never worked remotely or who want to learn more about how to best present it to a team.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I was so excited to read it that i put aside the other book i was reading at the time. Boy do i wish i would have skipped this book altogether. The characters do not have the depth that they did. Especially Four who spends most of his time complaining about his insecurities. Also the main conflict that was built up over 3 books was resolved with almost no conflict.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I LOVE this case! comes in FUN colors and durable. Its a Snap on style, which I prefer, Not too bulky. Adds tons of protection! I've dropped my phone several times and not damaged my actual phone. Add a nice screen protector and you're all set!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very challenging with lots of options on how you want to play. You don't have to purchase crystals but it will speed up your game. If you are looking for challenging look and find type game, then this is it. Have fun.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King still as the gift. Plot thickens and you keep reading. Intense and well thought out. Always finding horror in ordinary life.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part, i just didn't like the end.  Without giving anything away, the guy was just ridiculous.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|I will agree the game is good, However, every time I played on my Kindle, it froze up. Would have to shut my Kindle down and restart.  Way to much hassle to enjoy the game! JMHO!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The series was just plain dumb.  The writing was horrible.  I cannot figure out why people enjoyed these books.  I cannot figure out why a publisher would publish anything with this quality of writing.  If the sex and &#34;toys&#34; were left out of the series, then there would be one very small poorly written book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The plot is vintage Grisham. It is staged in the same Mississippi town as originally used in &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; and employs some of the same characters but there the similarity ends. At first, I feared that Grisham was coasting on the great reception that &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; received but soon realized that Sycamore Row had an entirely different thrust. Like &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;, &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; ends  in an unusual and suspenseful court trial. If you enjoyed the first book, you will want to read this one.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I don't know how to word this.  Ok well let's start this way.  I enjoyed the book.  While reading, I thought it was kind of slow.  It was until the end that I decided to give it for stars.  I liked the characters.  Lena is a very good character.  She's relatable.  Hana is alright as well.  I was actually a little shocked by her choices in the end.  Alex was an awesome character.  I wish I had a boyfriend like him.  I can't wait to learn more about him.  I gave this book 4 stars because I liked the concept of love being a disease, I enjoyed the characters, and this book had one of the best cliffhanger endings I've ever read! Read it!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love the graphics, and the game is tons of fun and totally addictive. Was worth the price, and though can't beat free!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|What a wonderful experience into a new world.  Terrific read into another culture that really isn't too far from our own thoughts, dreams ext
B008G3N71W|5.0|Erotica comes in many forms and it seems to me that the secret of good erotica is that it has to be literary, well-written without vulgarity. Chloe Thurlow is a writer who achieves this in an extraordinary way and the sheer power of her prose left me breathless. A Girl's Adventure is one adventure I did enjoy and I will be seeking out more of her books in the future.
B00CY3SEN6|5.0|Great story, real world feel too. Don't need to read his other book first but I will now. Great read
B0091R30MS|4.0|A very intuitive book. We'll researched but almost seems too much conclusive evidence.<br />A good book to put you to sleep at night as you can put it down and rejoin it without having to remember where you were.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works well to cast Netscape, Youtubes or your laptop scren onto your TV without a physical connection. It will only improve. It's cheap and easy to install.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE Candy Crush Saga. I am so glad it was FINALLY available for my Kindle Fire. This game is more addictive than candy,  and I REALLY love candy.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|great fit,travels well, we put it in the case all the time if were flying or driving around it helps in taking care of the screen
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think the app works good , but you need to keep it up to date. I don't like it running slow, not updating my news feed, or showing that I have notifications. It keeps giving me am option to upgrade on Google, but not the app store here. So just fix it. Updates need to be here to keep it running smooth.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is a random sample of the bishop's first time to add messages and I have questions about this page. Steven Spielberg's first pitch in this page is not super concerned. The only one who has been available urinary tract of the knight rider is too much to add some feedback.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I downloaded this app, because all of my friends had it, and said it was amazing. I got the app and started playing, it was so much fun! Not confusing at all! The $6.99 is so worth it! It was a bit confusing with the multiplayer mode, but I figured it out. This app is awesome!! You're missing out if you don't have this app!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush. I am totally addicted and I was I was a little better at it. I have friends. that help me when I'm stuck.
B00EH486AQ|5.0|This was a very good figure .You should also check out the other Neca figures .Gipsy was a very high quality collectible I like everything about it the only bad thing is the swords are kind of hard to put in the slits in the wrists. All in all a good figure.

1579655327|4.0|I thought the book was very well done. I enjoyed the glimpses of<br />the people, thier lifestyles and recipies. I enjoyed it very much.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game!!!! Glad we finally got a version. Sometimes the connect to Facebook doesn't for well. It's still tons of fun. Just fix that.
0679746323|5.0|I am listening to the final CD of the 25 CDs of the audio book. The book itself is masterful. Rarely have I heard such a great account of one man's life. The details unearthed from the hundreds of people interviewed, people who knew Mao the man, make this story even more powerful than those told by other writers on this subject.<br /><br />The scale of Mao's brutality and sheer evil is hard to grasp. He hated the Chinese people with a vengeance and often laughed at the millions of deaths he orchestrated. His loyalty to his family, fellow Communists, his nation and his regime, was nil. All those around him died at his hand. His entire family was destroyed by him. His colleagues were all killed by him. He was the consummate egotist who had no concern for anyone but himself.<br /><br />He singlehandedly ordered the wholesale destruction of all Chinese traditional culture. He even forbade doctors to treat the sick during the years of the Great Leap Forward where he took all the food produced and gave it away to foreign nations to impress them with Chinese generosity. 38 million people died as a result of this. His response was to tell them to eat tree bark.<br /><br />At the same time the fat pig had a foreign chef imported to serve him the most sumptuous banquets.<br /><br />The audio version of this book is read by a man who has a wonderful voice and diction. Unfortunately, I found it painful to listen to his pronunciation of Chinese names ( called Chou en lai, chow when it is pronounced jo; the region of xingjiang he pronounced zinjiang when is it pronounced shinjiang; etc. etc.).<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an accurate account of the life of Mao.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Glad I had this on my trip, but also use at home for a truly easy alarm clock to use
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Great movie - full of suspense.  Strictly for those over 18 years of age.  Movie sure showed the effects of alcohol and drugs on a person.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Best English Bible available. Footnotes and readings of other translations on the same page with main text is great. The app works beautifully, even on my phone. Variable size type makes this fantastic for us old half-blind ones.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Its a great puzzle app.. kind of addicting! Its just like doing a real puzzle but I can do it in bed :) Wish there were more puzzle options, though.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|As with his other works Neil Gaiman here tells a tale of the supernatural in natural, unforced terms. It makes for both an interesting and a slightly terrifying read. It does not grip quite as tightly nor is it as clever as Neverwhere and this may be a result of the author's own admission that this was a short story that grew into a novel(la).<br /><br />All said it was an enjoyable diversion and relatively light reading,
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved it. It kept you on your toes the whole time. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes suspenseful books :)
B00E6X4GAW|3.0|As courageous as she is, and as wonderful that the terrorists bullet didn't kill her, I found much of the book proof as to why religion poisons everything.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading about her day to day life, how much her family stood by her and encouraged her to be educated and to advocate for the education of girls, not just boys.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a great and entertaining book. It was clever, compassionate, sweet, and gave a great observation on how people with cancer are treated.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|captivating story line, watching a man greeted as a hero and showing the flaws that led to a reveal of underlining truth
B0015ABRE2|4.0|Another good season of Dexter.  Jimmy Smits is very good in his guest role.  Not a side of this actor that has been seen much before.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I had a night off and thought \\"I like to relax and watch the good sci-fi movie\\".<br />I found \\"oblivion\\" and decided I would give it a shot, but 2 1/2 hours later I regret every minute of it! Don't waste your money on this movie.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|One of the weirdest, quirkiest films ever made.  The anniversary addition adds a lot to this wild ride of a movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love this app.  I am so happy its finally on kindle... I love the reach level and every one in my house is addicted.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I loved the movie and wanted the soundtrack to relive my favorite parts of the show.  It does not feature all of the songs from the movie, but enough to make it worthwhile.
B000002KDS|5.0|One of 'Coop's best. What's not to like. Awesome songs, guitar work, and ATTITUDE! Just get it. Would benefit from a remaster probably. Songs are terrific, fidelity is not up to today's standards.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Great music, and Tim Curry's performance alone makes it deserve 7 out of 5 stars. It still goes strong in college towns as a &#34;participatory&#34; movie.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|As great as the original Stooges got. I asked Ron Ashton about L.A. Blues once. He said &#34;Rock didn't feel like playing drums that day&#34;. Hell, I don't know. Ron also said he played his Stratocaster (pictured) through a little Sears Silvertone amp. Just buy this disc, it is a terrific piece of rock history and the songs are good! Really good!
0345803485|4.0|The cover was a bit more worn than I expected, but overall the book is readible and in decent condition.  Slightly contradictory to the listing, but I'm satisfied.
B000024TFY|5.0|Was given a cassette of this a long, long time ago. This album's songs run together like a concept album. Every note is in its proper place. If you like Judas Priest, you'll love this disc.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love being able to stay connect to friends and family anytime. Easy to use. My family loves being able to see pictures of my kids.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I usually go for movies that are based on true stories, and this is one of my favorite. Jennifer Carpenter is absolutely amazing as Emily Rose.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the series and it keeps getting better and better. Even my husband enjoys it. Characters are well developed.
006202406X|1.0|After 3 books THIS is how it ends???  Four is alone??  I felt so depressed when I finished.  I wish I would have just stopped after Divergent.  That book had great potential.  I would say don't waste your time.  Not worth the heartache.
B004Y6MIXS|5.0|I bought this adapter, the Alfa 9 dbi antenna, and the suction cup mount at the same time, so let me start by saying that I'm comparing this adapter the new antenna and stuck to a window vs. an internal Dell wifi card.  Hands down this new setup wins, both in signal strength and in speedtest numbers.<br /><br />I'd had an inkling that my Dell laptop (with B/G/N) wasn't seeing as far as I'd like when another computer in the house was able to see and connect to access points that I could barely see on the listing.  This has helped quite a bit, I'm glad I bought this even though it felt like a waste originally since I had B/G/N coverage.  This really helps improve the signal strength at the computer.
B003GQM52Q|4.0|There is a small amount of dis-tasteful language but it didn't last long.. Loved the Movie other than that. It Rocked
1455523003|3.0|Interesting, but biased, I think. If one accepts the statements Hitchens makes as fact, the whole Mother Teresa cult is spurious. M. Teresa had feet of clay...and then some!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|First, let me say that I'm 67 years old.  Second, I must say I grew up with Rock.  My forty year old son told me about the Chili Peppers, so I listened to their CD's that the library had, and got interested.  Then, I saw them on SNL, and I have rarely seen a band with more athleticism and musicality.  I couldn't believe what great music they produced, while jumping around like maniacs.  I've seen a lead singer run around some, and a few other musicians, but everybody but the drummer was dancing, kicking, and generally tearing around.  I made 3 copies of the SNL show.  I'm sorry that they lost their bassist, he was so good.<br /><br />I'm glad Amazon was able to get this DVD, and I hope more concerts will become available.
0316017922|5.0|I didn't think I'd enjoy this--it's non-fiction--but I loved it. It held my interest very nicely, the writing was interesting and the subjects were more so.
B000J159N8|5.0|Great story I've watched it 3 times already. Well worth a look. I am sure I will watch it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|We can't wait for the movie to portray thus trilogy! Excellently written & LOVE the witty in the email tid bits!!
0992251656|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Firefly fan, and I really wanted to like this game...but I couldn't. This game is DRIPPING with theme. The artwork is amazing...the components are great...it has a ton of the characters from the show. But at its core, this is a pick-up and deliver game...and a boring one at that. There is almost no interaction between players, and turns can take a long time. And about the time...this game is way too long for what it is. The box says it should take two hours to play, but I have yet to play a game that wasn't 3+ hours. I gave the game 3 stars due to the theme, but there are similar games out there that are much more fun to play.
B005KR6NS6|5.0|Totally beautiful!  I was enthralled throughout. If you love dancing and wonderful story telling, this is a must see.  J
B001NLL93W|4.0|This felt like an end of a series book, answering so many questions and tying up loose ends, especially when it come to Jace and Clary and their romance. There were moments of passion, heartache, and plenty of action. I just wish Ms. Clare had not taken nearly three books to resolve the problem of Jace and Clary, especially when the reader knows it has to be coming and every scene with them ends in frustration at their situation. I hope that Ms. Clare makes up for that frustration in her future books with plenty of heartfelt scenes between Jace and Clary.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|First, read: &#34;Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!&#34;, in the review section.<br />This movie reminded me of Gilligan's Island: idiots doing stoooopid things, just to make a show.<br />The charactors were so endearing, one didn't care they got offed. Darwin at it's finest.<br />I sure am glad I didn't spend the money to see this in a theater, although I did get suckered in to paying $10 for the DVD.<br />My bad.<br />Anyone want to buy a slightly used movie?
6302182557|5.0|I love this movie! A rollicking fantasy adventure authored by the wonderful imagination of the great George Lucas! Definitely worth a look!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|another great book by Nelson DeMille....very exciting throughout. I tried to save it for airplane reading only but last night  I couldn't sleep and I finished it! Excellent!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Its Alien with the extended and theatrical editions. This is a great buy! I got it on a daily deal for 20 bucks. Would be better if Prometheus was in it also but its still a steal.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|couldn't figure out how to get it to work with my iPhone -- which is why I bought it. Useless to me.
B00C7607BC|5.0|The DVD set was exactly as advertised.  It was brand new, good quality, and exactly what I had expected from my favorite Disney movie.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|No really surprises in this book.  Those who make it to the TOP in their fields didn't just get there thru hard work, they had opportunities that most other people did not have.  Each chapter has a little different spin on the same concept.  Gets a little redundant, but interesting none the less.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is entertaining. I would like to be able to zoom in on the rooms.<br />Other than that i have no complaints.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book  touched me deeply. The skill of the author in developing the characters and the brutal honesty of their lives gripped me from beginning to end.
1609611543|4.0|I am still reading it but it connects with so many different illnesses. Who would have thought years ago that wheat could be so harmful to your body. It is so much more than a wheat belly.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|An absolute blast to watch, the best Def Leppard on film you will find. Watched it on big screen with good sound and a group of friends and it was the closest you'll come to seeing a kick ass Def Leppard concert without being there. The live Hysteria song were amazingly close to the original but honestly better in some ways. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think I like this version of the song better.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I admit that I enjoy stories with happy endings where the characters I've grown to love are victorious. I become a character as I read, so this story ripped out my heart. Despite that personal struggle, I realize the enormity of Veronica Roth going against the grain. What happens here is real. People don't always get what they want, and life is rarely rainbows and butterflies. I was captivated through the emotional pain and am truly relieved to read a young adult book that addresses survival after such a great loss.
B000VBJEFK|1.0|i got it and was told it had audio commentary and i needed that but when i got it my hopes and dreams were crushed it does not have that even tho its suppust to be on the bluray verson
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game to help you pass the time and to get yyour brain going. I would recommend this app to anyone and everyone
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not a big sci fi reader but I couldn't put this down. Cleverly written with enough twists and turns to be enjoyably unpredictable.
0140186395|5.0|Probably one of the best books I have ever read. I have never thought of a book as beautifully written and feel that term is thrown around in literature quite a bit. I was truly finding myself stopping to reread certain sentences over and over again because I was in awe of how something so simple could be so detailed. I loved each character and story line.  The first book I can ever say I believe was written beautifully. I literally could not stop reading. I have never done a review on amazon for any other book I've read. I'm sure I will reread this book a few more times in my lifetime. A true classic.
B00E1LQ7Q0|3.0|All the songs sound the same to me. They sort of run into each other. Songs are all similar. Probably won't listen to this much.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Thought-provoking story! I enjoyed it right to the end, although I couldn't help but feel a bit slighted by the book's treatment of nerd culture. While ostensibly celebrating the film and gaming culture of his main character, the author only achieves a superficial and stereotypical treatment of the genres. On the upside, readers without any prior knowledge of these subjects should not have trouble understanding the story. On the downside, those who ought to like it most will probably fail to recognize themselves in any of the characters.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Unrealistic and predictable.  Movie dragged on and on and on.  I was expecting so much more.  The movie's premiss is an obvious drunk and coked-up pilot gets behind the controls of a commercial airliner and no one stops him? (we know the flight attendant saw his condition and chose to do nothing).  Really? I wouldn't get on a bus with a drunk no less an airplane.  The only saving grace is (1) the predictable ending is in fact the ending and (2) I didn't have to pay to see the movie.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I find it a little hard to understand. My 5 year old grandson understands<br />better than me. will keep trying to use it.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Incredible as I expected! That OVO and that XO, Your girl be at my next show!!  drake goes hard and we thank him for it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Couldn't wait to download this game. Waited a long time before it<br />was available through Amazon. Already hooked on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app so much better on my kindle fire HD. Can't stop play it, highly addictive. Can't wait until they get pet rescue as well:)
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />That's all I could think after I finished this book. Wow. And then I sat there, staring at the last page for a good 3 minutes thinking about the enormity of what I had just read; then I promptly flipped to page 1 and started again.<br /><br />Ignore any reviews from readers that openly confess that they hadn't finished the book, for obvious reasons. Of the remaining reviews, I'd expected the feelings to be polarized.<br /><br />Give it a go, and see what you think. Be warned that it's not for the feint of heart.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game makes you feel like you actually have your own city. And being mayor of your own city is awesome
B0001CNRSE|3.0|I chose this rating because I didn't like this movie but it is also not the worse movie I've ever saw.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You gotta get this game my brother loves it my cousins love it even my friends it soooooo popular almost all of my friends know about it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great gadget, really easy to install, I can play any video from you tube or movies from Netflix but it doesn't let you play videos taken with the phone when streaming from my iPhone.
B0012GMZ4U|2.0|I though it would be mostly in French language but it was only sung in French for to few phrases. I had the original album and loved it.  But in the decades sense recording the music is now dated, to big and brassie, snare drums.  For historians this is perfect example of pop music  in the 60's.  Barabra is in top form but have come to prefer her more mature voice.
B004132HZS|5.0|I am not going to lie I am a bit bias on this review.  I have watched the series on netflix before I got this set.  I got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she is in love with the series, and possibly Benedict Cumberbatch.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Yawn.  I suppose if this game amused you at the arcades of old then it might be something to wile away the hours, but honestly listen to a good podcast or something.
B00G118LYY|5.0|This is well done, simple, cute, and intuitive. Good for the younger kid. They will get a kick out of running over the cardboard houses, making jumps on the ramps, and building their own sets.
B00C5R8364|3.0|The plot and writing style is as good as we have come to expect from Mr. Forsyth. However it lacks the twists and turns which Mr. Forsyth's stories usually take. Indeed, considering the immense resources at hand, the whole story is somewhat a lop-sided affair with the conclusion foregone right from the beginning.<br /><br />A good read, but not one of the best.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the best christmas movie. It's hilarious and we watch it every year! It's right next to Home Alone for must see movies during Christmas.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|If you are a Liam Neeson fan, this is a must see movie.<br />Liam and his spouse travel to Germany for a seminar where Liam is to deliver a speech on a hybrid agricultural product that will help end starvation with a new strain of corn that is resistant to bugs, drouhght and plant disease.  Before he can deliver his speech, he is involved in a car accident where he loses his memory - and then the adventure begins.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|you will have the time of your life exploring this awsome game. I hope. you will enjoy this app as much as I did.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|While this plot has been used very sparingly - once on Matlock - it is still a fantastic movie.  Matthew McConaughey is strong as a criminal attorney and knows how not to alienate those that many would be afraid of - burly bikers!  The movie is action packed even though you can guess at what is coming next in parts of the movie, but the twists at the end are unexpected.<br />Definitely rent or buy this movie, expecially if you are a Matthew McConaughey fan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very entertaining, easy to read and holds your attention.  Will proceed with the next installment of the trilogy.  It is a tad on the seductive side as well.  :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book. First time reading Liane Moriarty, and I really enjoyed her writing. Great story that told all sides and I love how it all tied together and really makes you think of life. I look forward to reading more by this author. I highly recommend this one to everyone.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Great characters, hilarious--as truth often is.  If you've ever worked in an office, or simply if you've ever worked with other people (Is it possible not to?) it's easy to relate to this movie and laugh at life.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is amazing... I enjoy playing it, and even my kids enjoy playing it, even if it is to just get the coins but they just love the colorful dragons
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|The beginning of this series is an amazing book.  I have loved it for years and continue to be able to read it again and again.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|This game has.great graphics and you get a wide range of planes.<br />You get to fly what's not good about flying
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book for all ages.  It is, of course, so much better than the movie.  It has many twists and turns and is hard to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Finally,  I've. been waiting for this so happy,  but when I connect to Facebook it doesn't give me the stuff I bought on there!!! :-(
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|I only wanted this for streaming video, I don't have much need for supplemental space for audio or still pics.I  had some trouble with dropped video streams when I first started, but have learned how to stream successfully.<br /><br />This device can stream video well if you follow these tips:<br /><br />1. It is best to watch your video in the same room as your Kingston MobileLite, too far away can cause you to drop the stream. It doesn't seem to have the same range as your average Wireless router.<br /><br />2. Be sure you have enough free storage on your tablet for buffering the video. 2GB or more has worked for me.<br /><br />3. If you want to plug a USB hard drive into the Kingston MobileLite, make sure the hard drive has a source of power separate from the Kingston MobileLite.<br /><br />4. If you are having trouble with dropping the stream, try a different video player. A few have worked well for me including BSplayer, and the generic Android vidoeo player.<br /><br />5. You can plug in a USB cable in to the Kingston MobileLite to charge it while it is running, so it doesn't run down. But it is best to plug it in after you have the video streaming.<br /><br />6. You may want to have a power supply for your tablet. Some Tablets seem to run down faster when streaming from the Kingston MobileLite then when playing video from storage or from Amazon Prime, or Netflix. I had one run down after (1) 2 hour movie.<br /><br />7. I have three android tablets ( A Toshiba thrive, an ASUS TF700T, and a Galaxy Note 8) and two Kindle Fire HDs (Both 7\\" & 9\\"). They all seem to work well, if you follow these steps.
0393325172|5.0|It is difficult to write a review for any single volume in this series for  several reasons:  First, after reading several of the volumes, I find it exceedingly difficult to review any past volume 1 without becoming redundant or reciting the story line.  Second, with 21 volumes (even though I only purchased 20 of them because I could not adhere to the thinking that an unfinished volume is still a volume of work by the author, especially one as brief as volume 21.) I find that five stars are extremely prohibitive in trying to give comparative ratings.  That would suggest that some of them would be of less than 5 star rating in order to compare one rating to another, without implying that at least one or more do not stand up to the author's normal standard, or as compared to volumes by other authors.  When compared to other authors, Patrick O'Brian is simply a head above the rest, so my rating system would have to start at 5 stars, followed with other volumes which are 5 star +. 5 Star ++, 5 Star +++, etc.  Unfortunately yet understandably, Amazon would have difficulties with such a system.<br />But what of my overall ratings?  The 5 stars apply to all of the several volumes I have read thus far, and only partway through it, I went ahead and purchased all of the volumes because I realized they were all in fact of the same quality. For example, Mr. O'Brian does not introduce a term followed by &#34;and that means.....&#34; which can be very boring to the reader.  Instead, his friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, or one of the young Midshipmen aboard, may ask &#34;Lucky Jack Aubrey&#34; what something means, or what it is used for, and Jack will explain to them the meaning or usage as it applies to them.  You may not get your answer the first time the word or term pops up, but &#34;stay tuned folks&#34; it will come in time; in time for it to be necessary that you know the answer.  If you don't want to wait, then purchase &#34;A Sea Of Words&#34;,  By Dan King, John Hattendorf,and J. Worth Estes, third edition, which explains most of the words and terms not familiar to those of us who were not in the 18th and 19th century Royal Navy.<br />Additionally, I found it difficult to understand the strategy and tactics used in the battles in the first couple of volumes, but like the termanology, I found that the more I read, the more excited I became going into battle, trying to outthink Lucky Jack Aubrey.  Before I knew it, I found myself in a game of chess with Lucky Jack similar to the games the other navies found themselves in  whose misfortune it was to enter into an engagement with Jack and his well trained (at least most of the time) crews.  Trying to anticipate his next move would sometimes require the tact and nerve of a world champion chess player, with the stakes being quite a bit higher.<br />Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander series is even more exciting when read by a couple, or friends who want to compare notes at points along the line of this never-ending story, each trying to anticipate Jack's next move, and finding that there is seldom two answers alike, or a predictable right answer.<br />The sad part is, of course, that all good things must come to an end.  Unfortunately, this series only ended due to the demise of an incredibly enternaining author, and an author whose readers found his writing addictive.  Were he still alive, this series would have several more volumes, and many thousands, if not millions more delighted readers, trying to think of a concise way to write a review of the series.<br />I am putting this review in volume 1, while attempting to include reviews spaced along the way, and in doing so, trying to avoid &#34;giving away&#34; of too much of the story line, but as I said at the beginning, that will not be easy.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|It includes everything that is of interest around the topic, studies, personal accounts, calorie counts etc<br />It is easy to read, and helps YOU to make the decision that best suits your lifestyle.<br />Empowering in an area that seldom does.
1250038820|5.0|I was extremely excited to receive HONY's book as a gift, and it fulfilled all the expectations that I had for it.  The pictures were naturally all stunning, and the product was very well put-together.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding show. My wife and I watched all three seasons over a week while we were both under the weather. We got to a point where we couldn't wait to watch the next show. Now that we have completed, we are very much anticipating Jan. 5th when the new season starts. Quality and delivery of all the shows was flawless using iPad and airplay to watching TV.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love the setup puzzles and great storyline. like I said best of G5 games. totally worth the price for the full game. great graphics in my opinion
B00902AKK4|2.0|I enjoyed the tutorial, but even the &quot;beginner&quot; levels were frustrating to navigate. I like my learning curves to be a little less steep.<br /><br />Two things in particular struck me as unnecessary:<br />-Death: why would a puzzle game introduce death as an optional outcome?<br />-Chance: the acorns fall at random. I love puzzle games, but strategy and skill should determine your success, not chance.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to navigate. Any one, young or &quot;mature in age&quot; can play. Animation is great. Souhds are kinda funky. Would highly recommend.
043599445X|5.0|The book has clear and concise information. Plus it is required to study Biology for the  for the IB program.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Bitterly disappointing end to an otherwise entertaining series. The other books had flaws, but dear Lord, this was a disaster. Do yourself a favor and go read the Legend trilogy by Marie Lu or re-read the Hunger Games, but don't bother with this one.

B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|Mainly this film interests me because of Depp and the story. This is one of those films that changed my opinion about Johnny Depp. Somehow he fools me within the first 30 minutes and I forget I am watching him, and this is true in this movie as well. I’ve read some criticism of Depp’s performance, in particular his age at the time. But I think he does a great job, especially considering the director. I’ve never been a real Roman Polanski fan. Frank Langella is another actor I like, a sentiment I have never understood, and he is solid in The Ninth Gate. I only gave the film three stars and here is why, Roman Polanski blew it. Here he has a very rich story and solid actors all around, I only mentioned two, but I think everyone performed well. Yet the last 40 minutes feels as if all the potential is blown way like smoke. Overall The Ninth Gate is worth a watch.
0767810856|4.0|It's a charmer. Believable acting, realistic apts and a real sweetness to it. Rosie Perez is a hoot. Reminds of the Frank Capra movies of years gone by.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Didn't know I could play this on Android.  It's a bit processor heavy so sucks some battery, but plays smoothly enough.  They've been releasing these Magic games for about 4 years now and they are fun simple and so so so much cheaper than all the childhood lunch money I spent on card packs back in the day<br /><br />PROs - price, fun, simple.<br /><br />CON - Multiplayer on PS3 and PC is much easier than over Android.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Interesting concept brought forth in a very round about but exciting story.  As usual Aloysius is spectacular and very odd.  I really liked this book,  even though it seemed too wander and was difficult for me to follow at times.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|It's a solid pinball app. The add on tables are a nice system but a touch expensive.  However since pinballs are a dying breed of games I'll take what I can get.
B000002LAC|5.0|Great album! Just the one song &#34;Those memories of you&#34; was worth the price of the album and the rest are top notch too

B001MM28JG|5.0|\\"Galaxy Quest\\" is, on the surface, a spoof of \\"Star Trek\\" and its fans.  But it is a very funny movie in its own right, spoofing the entire genre of Science Fiction shows and movies.  My kids have not really seen the original \\"Star Trek\\" series, but still love this film.<br /><br />It has a \\"stellar\\" cast (pun intended).  Tim Allen, in one of his best movie roles, is Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, suggesting but not imitating William Shatner.  Alan Rickman, one of the best actors for movie villains, gets to play a good guy for once, as an alien member of the crew indirectly spoofing Leonard Nemoy's Mr. Spock.  Sigourny Weaver is wonderful in this comedic role as the communications officer.  Tony Shaloob (\\"Monk\\") is the quirky Ship's Engineer, and Sam Rockwell (\\"Iron Man 2,\\" \\"Moon\\") does what he does best as a fan who was once an extra on the show.  Even Justin Long has a small role as one of the die-hard fans.<br /><br />The plot of the film is unique: The cast of \\"Galaxy Quest,\\" an old Science Fiction television show, are surviving seventeen years after the show was cancelled by making appearances at Science Fiction Conventions for die-hard fans.  One group of fans turn out to actually be \\"Thermians,\\" aliens who thought that the TV show was a historical record of actual events.  They have carefully built the ship and all of its gadgets and now need the Captain and Crew to help them when an evil alien is trying to wipe out their race.<br /><br />Like many great comedies, this film has a bunch of quotable lines which will remind fans of funny moments.  While there are plenty of laughs, the film does not sacrifice story for comedy.  \\"Galaxy Quest\\" combines comedy, action & adventure with just a touch of romance.  It is one of those movies that I often recommend to people who have not seen it.  This is one of the movies I like to re-watch every few months, and I am constantly going, \\"Oh, this is my favorite part . . .\\"
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|The best animated movie I've seen, and I've seen a lot.  Everything about the movie screams an epic tale.  I just hope some of this story makes it to the Batman/Superman movie in 2015.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Gameplay is fun and addictive.  Graphics are beautiful.  Attention to detail is commendable.  I just can't believe a free game has sucked up this much of my time and WAY too much of my money.  I'm a grownup and should know better, but now I have invested too much time and money to quit now.  I just wish I had read the reviews and decided against a game that charges such high prices to get the characters needed to go farther in the game.  So, if you have a tree that grows money, download this game and enjoy spending obscene amounts of money for a a useless digital reward.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an incredible game for anyone looking for a game where they may freely roam around, mess with the landscape, build things, and explore the inner depths of your imagination. Along with the fact that you can play the game, you can play Minecraft Realms, a multiplayer version of the game that comes with every purchase. However, it unfortunately is only available to people with a Mojang account. If you have the requirements to play multiplayer, you can share your single player masterpieces with your friends. If you aren't in the same room as your other player, don't worry. No need to place signs everywhere. You can chat! Overall, the game is worth the money being required.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I watch this over and over again, it is so good.  Fast paced, you don't know who to trust, and in the end, there are still a couple of mysteries.  Love it. .
B00FXRTWQ8|4.0|I have had no problems with this game. It downloaded easily and has not crash at all. The graphics are really good. It is nice being able to see the  items you can buy, and not have to spend your own money. It's a nice game to play when you have a few minutes. Anyone would enjoy playing this game.

006202406X|4.0|Veronica Roth completes her Divergent Trilogy with a shocking, well plotted, consistent, rather long installment that has Tris and Tobias venturing out of the only world they have known and being awakened to what is really going on.  Ms. Roth, as has been true for the previous two installments in this (rightfully so) best-selling Young Adult series, pulls no punches and gives the reader no reason to expect the future to be much different from the world inhabited at present.  There is much good around each of us, an equaling amount of cause for alarm and each person must make choices that will lead them onto paths that will define the next choice offered them.<br /> After the “purging” that ended the Insurgent section of the series, the Factions are disbanded, leadership is returning to the tyrannical practices “of the previous administration,” and everyone, it seems, are living with rules that are shadowy and constantly in flux.  Tris, having been branded a traitor because of her actions in the insurrection, must face questioning, after been given Truth Serum, to determine her fate. As a result of her being “divergent,” she is able to withstand the effects of the serum and is given a sentence that gives her to opportunity to escape and fulfill Edith Prior’s directive of “helping us outside the fence.”  Tobias, son of the new leader of the City, surrenders his position to join the Allegiant, a group who want to overthrow the present regime and return to life as it was and also to escape to the world beyond the boundaries of the only reality he has ever known.<br />Similar to Plato’s cave analogy, what this group (of six, including our heroes) discovers when they arrive at their destination is a shock, discovering that what they “knew” to be true was but a illusion meant to keep them entertained until they discovered they were only looking at shadows.  This is but the first incident of being confronted with truth that was not True.  With each new revelation, each person must assess the information, choose what to believe and take action.  There are changes that must be made and difficult selections to face by all.  Late in the book Tobias gives definition to the trilogy, “Sometimes, all it takes to save people from a terrible fate is one person willing to do something about it” (p.438).<br /> The story is a bit draggy for the first third to half of its length (better editing would have improved the book tremendously) but once it starts rolling, the reader is often left breathless in an effort to keep pace with its cadence. There is harsh language that is surprising for younger readers, and occasional “romantic” moments that are warm, but never cross into “hot.” Told from the alternate, first person perspectives of Tris and Tobias, the book proffers the reader viewpoints that are often at odds but whose tension is the foundational element of the series.  In order to understand the majority of this book, the reader must have read the previous two volumes in the trilogy.<br />Ms. Roth is brave in her ending the trilogy as she did.  It would have been just as easy to have all the heroes walking in a world that is clean, orderly and without conflict. To have done so would have been to lessen the impact of the trilogy.  It has been honest, offering a realistic assessment of the world, demanding in its assessment that not all good choices end with the reward expected or merited but that does not make the choice any less needed or correct.  Difficult conflict will occur and be resolved; life will offer new conflicts just as difficult tomorrow.  Living requires that we: work hard, laugh, make connections, watch those connections be suddenly severed, go make new relationships just as vital, rise each morning with the knowledge that<br />“Life damages us, everyone. We can’t escape that damage.<br />But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other” (p. 526).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once again, Collins delivers in her third book of the Hunger Games series. Packed with riveting action, yet balanced with tenderness and sensitivity. Recommended for those who cheer for the underdog, when the 'deck' is stacked against them!
B000669GAI|5.0|Cheaper than going to the store plus the download to my phone made this too good of a deal to turn down. CD is perfect and wrapped up
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! Took me right back to being a kid again. Rowell is a gifted writer, with quite the talent for developing characters that the reader can both understand and fall in love with. I will read this book over and over, and it will never get old.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is amazing. I became so addicted to it. The only issue I have, and this may just be my own problem, but sometimes the game just stops being connected to the server and I have to exit out. Other than that, it's super fun, very vibrant, easy to use.
1451666179|5.0|Well worth buying. Best Coffee table book you will ever own! It stays funny no matter how many times you or your guests have read the stories. They are times less well written and something almost everyone can relate to in there own lives.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you saw the Shinning put that movie away way back in your mind .In fact just forget it. READ the Shinning  the real thing and then read Dr. Sleep. You are headed for a fabulous read .
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it is a fun eniugh game. however some levels are hard to beat and if you run out of lives you have to wait before you can play again
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really like this match three game. The graphics are cute and colorful. Just don't like the fact that the app is advertised as free, but then after you get into it you have to buy the app to continue.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This book touched me deeply.Unlike other reviewers I did not feel that it was particularly about Nigeria despite detailed descriptions of landscapes and horrifying  living conditions. I think that what gives this book it's universality is that it could have happened anywhere in the world. It is a story of fanaticism,cruelty,madness, silence, courage and  denial.<br />Hillel Halkin MD (full disclosure -my husband) has just published a new book -Telling Silences:A Doctor's Tales of Denial- in which patients' silences like those of  the two children in Purple Hibiscus cry out for help and  the doctor's efforts to break through the silences are only partly rewarded with success much like those of the  children's courageous aunt. it is perhaps this connection to real life experiences that has left me so moved when reading this marvelous book. I have also read Half of a Yellow Sun and I highly recommend it to anyone who loved Purple Hibiscus.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is very user friendly for  us with large fingers and is very well designed for ease of use.  Beats any other that I tried.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Plays my music perfect, just like it should. 5 STAR. AMO keep up the good work. This my music home away from home.
006202406X|4.0|I did like the book. It was interesting for sure. Although some things were very \\"uh what?\\" And the POV switching was little annoying because more often then not I forgot who was speaking because the voices were so similar. I actually think that the book could have been more brutal. It felt a little passive with all the \\"little\\" revolutions that take place at the Bureau. At first I was really upset with the ending because I actually wanted it to end somewhat on a good note. Because that is what we are used to in YA. But Tris was Divergent and that was that. I am more sad for Tobias than anyone. He lost his other half. But he regained a mother who always did love him but was also afraid. This is the kind of book that you won't be happy with, but you will see why later. We don't always read books to be happy. And we shouldn't have expected that from this series. It is dystopian afterall.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|great movie for those motorcycle travelers and to those who want to know a lit about Alaska and where to go

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this game finally came to kindle, it was the main reason I bought one so I was very disappointed when at first it wasn't available. This is my all time favourite game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love Chromecast. If you have netflix, this is the easiest way to broadcast it to your t.v. Just download it to your computer or phone, than cast it. The &#34;set-up&#34; only requires plugging it into a powersource and into a HDMI slot in the t.v. Easy and great to use.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|There is not much to dislike about the complete studio albums, 14 remastered, plus live CDs and a bonus 2 CDs. I have all of this already except \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" and \\"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\\", but it's scattered across CD's, LPs, tapes, DVDs, Laserdiscs and every format they came out with. Now it's all in one box, one place. Don't even think of buying this set from anyone but Amazon.com. They have the best price.<br /><br />Here's an appreciation of Bob Dylan by the decades.<br /><br />The 60s<br /><br />The 60s gave us the first 9 albums of Bob Dylan&iexcl;¯s career: \\"Bob Dylan\\", \\"The Freewheelin&iexcl;¯ Bob Dylan\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin\\", \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\",  \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", \\"John Wesley Harding\\", and \\"Nashville Skyline.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit that&iexcl;¯s a pretty impressive body of work for a young singer who bounced out of the Midwest into New York City in 1961.<br /><br />Within those 9 albums Dylan paid homage to blues, folk, re-wrote the protest song, re-wrote rock and roll as a literate form of music, moved us into the night world of Blonde on Blonde, through the mysticism of Woodstock and plunked us firmly in Nashville USA.  Dylan played the background music for the best years of our lives, a friend said last night. We can't go back but we can listen and jam the songs with friends.<br /><br />The 70s<br /><br />Happily or otherwise married for half the 1970s, Dylan started one of the most controversial but productive periods of his career.<br /><br />Among the 13 albums, there are stellar albums here like the incomparable \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", \\"Slow Train Coming\\", \\"The Basement Tapes\\" (OK it&iexcl;¯s 60s material), \\"Hard Rain\\", and \\"New Morning.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the 70s are all over the map for Dylan. We just finished shelling out for \\"Another Self Portrait\\" so that one isn&iexcl;¯t like to get much play but it&iexcl;¯s part of the oeuvre. I can&iexcl;¯t get some of those songs out of my head like &iexcl;°Belle Isle.&iexcl;±<br /><br />Of course, any of us mere mortals would be happy to have produced just one, anyone of Dylan&iexcl;¯s 70&iexcl;&auml;s albums.<br /><br />Who owns \\"Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid?\\" No one but now you can with one of Dylan&iexcl;¯s two most famous songs ¨C &iexcl;°Knockin&iexcl;¯ on Heavens Door.&iexcl;± Just for laughs watch Kris Kristofferson grin his way though a shoot clip out on YouTube. Columbia got even with Dylan by issuing out-takes on \\"Dylan\\". The Asylum albums \\"Planet Waves\\" and \\"Before The Flood\\"  prove you don&iexcl;¯t get far dumping old friends, even over money.<br /><br />\\"Desire\\", \\"Street-Legal\\", \\"At Bukodan\\" (OMG those outfits and backup singers!) ¨C you gotta have them to be a completist.<br /><br />The 80s<br /><br />The taped voice-over to Dylan&iexcl;¯s Never Ending Tour says he hit rock bottom in the 1980s but he still produced some awesome, timeless material.<br /><br />He started the decade with Jesus and \\"Saved\\" and ended with \\"Oh Mercy\\" his first classic collaboration with Canadian Daniel Lanois.<br /><br />Top albums, if I may be allowed a bit of critical thinking, include \\"Infidels\\", \\"Real Live\\", and \\"Shot of Love.\\"<br /><br />Even the lesser of the albums have Dylan gems like &iexcl;°Emotionally Yours&iexcl;± and &iexcl;°When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky&iexcl;± from \\"Empire Burlesque\\",  &iexcl;°Brownsville Girl&iexcl;± from \\"Knocked Out Loaded\\", &iexcl;°Ninety Miles an Hour Down A Dead End Street&iexcl;± from \\"Down in the Groove.\\"<br /><br />\\"Dylan and The Dead (Live)\\" is a total mystery to me. Some people like it, some don&iexcl;¯t.  Most people admit it was the bottom for Dylan. Still 9 CD&iexcl;¯s when you are at your career ebb, that&iexcl;¯s impressive.<br /><br />The 90s and Beyond<br /><br />The last 2 decades have been Dylan&iexcl;¯s most productive since the 60s.<br /><br />Let me go out on a limb ¨C there&iexcl;¯s not a bad album among the 10 of them.<br /><br />OK I refused to buy \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" but still love to watch the &iexcl;°Must Be Christmas&iexcl;± video. If fact I watched it twice last night.<br /><br />\\"Under The Red Sky\\" is an album that Dylan produced for his last child but the songs are amazingly adult. &iexcl;°Wiggle Wiggle&iexcl;± and &iexcl;°Born in Time&iexcl;± are two of the classics. Dylan loves to play a driven blues version of &iexcl;°Cats in the Well&iexcl;± during his concerts.<br /><br />\\"Good as I&iexcl;¯ve Been to You\\" and \\"World Gone Wrong\\" have Dylan revisiting folk music starting another wave of interest in \\"roots music.\\" These 2 CDs are excellent and Dylan is in top guitar playing form.<br /><br />\\"MTV Unplugged\\" highlights classic Dylan material in a great setting. Buy the DVD if you can. It's worth repeated viewings.<br /><br />Dylan and Daniel Lanois team up again for the Grammy winning \\"Time Out of Mind\\" with its world-weary view of an older man. &iexcl;°Love Sick&iexcl;±, &iexcl;°Not Dark Yet&iexcl;± and the Adele hit &iexcl;°Make You Feel My Love&iexcl;± are some of the gems of \\"Time Out of Mind.\\"<br /><br />The trilogy of \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Modern Times\\" and \\"Together Through Life\\" ¨C all good ¨C take us to last year&iexcl;¯s \\"Tempest\\". All 4 show Dylan is still a creative powerful artist. I did not appreciate \\"Tempest\\" when it came out but I'm coming around on that one.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|It is well written and makes sense so I believe the information in this book is of value to couples who find themselves drifting apart due to lack of intimate understanding of each others needs and what is required in order for each person in a marriage to be able to thrive in that relationship,
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I stream Netflix and Youtubes videos on this. I hope in the future more applications are supported. I can also stream chromebrowser which allows me to diplay pictures and videos from my computer. Nice and cheap and easy to install/setup.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was the second John Grisham book that I have read. From page one to the last word I thoroughly enjoyed every minute.

John Grisham does not disappoint the reader.
1401938906|5.0|This book is good.  It is something that I have known and done for a long time without really realizing or utilizing to the fullest extent.  It puts everything into perspective and is easy to follow.

057809665X|5.0|Quick and easy to read, it's also a handy reference. This book gives a structure to ten nebulous concepts. Some of the concepts might seem like common sense to people interested in a book like this. The book delineates ten techniques into concrete tool kit. The author provides the concept, real-life applications and examples, anecdotal stories, and practice exercises. All in a quick, easy read.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast is at it again!  One of my favorite characters by one of my favorite writing teams definitely doesn't dissapoint in this book.  From the first shocker to the very last page, I was engrossed, entertained and enthralled.  Strongly recommended to all readers.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I imagined the device to be able to do a lot more than what it can. I thought I'll be able to project my iphone screen to the TV and see photos etc - instead all it does is to stream youtube :-(<br /><br />Even the Chrome Browser on IPhone does not get projected

B009CVRQLY|5.0|this new cd by Celine Dion is the best cd made by her so far. I really love this cd because it has fun and upbeat songs but also heartwarming songs. my favorite songs are Loved Me Back To Life, Always Be Your Girl, Incredible, and Unfinished Songs. Loved Me Back To Life is a fun and great love song with a great beat. Always Be Your Girl is a piano style song with a lot of heart and would be great as a romance love song or a mother/child relationship. Incredible is another fun song and sounds great because NE-YO is in it and Celine Dion and NE-YO sound great as a duet in a song. Unfinished songs is an inspirational and endearing song and is a song of hope. would recommend this cd to anyone even if you haven't liked Celine Dion's other cds. some of her older albums were boring and draggy but not this one.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This is a nice brain game. It's both fun &amp; challenging. It's a nice way to pass the time when I'm bored. I like that I can stop at any time &amp; resume the puzzel I was previously working on.
B00DC6YEE2|5.0|A classic with a Disney twist. Great value, all discs and the digital copy included. If you like Disney, or want a holiday movie with a twist, this is a great program for you!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it just like I did on android, but not paying to play so guess I will go as far as I can then stop. Don't love it that much!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Who would have thought that such a simple concept could be so addictive? That's what it is though. It's a great way to pass the time . Very colorful graphics. Good game for all ages.
1476727651|4.0|It's a good book, but I LOVE &#34;The Shining&#34; and this doesn't quite measure up.  I think &#34;The Shining&#34; is the scariest book I've ever read, so it would take a lot to top it.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Love this album! Love that Rick Rubin helped executive produce this album! I feel that Em is on top of his game again and his lyrical game and flow patterns prove that! MMLP2!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a very good game and its also frighteningly addictive. At first I wasn't very sure if I wanted to download this game by  after playing it for the very first Time  I was impressed by the very aura of the game
B006LSZECO|3.0|I wanted to give it a higher rating but the ending was so unfinished.  Once you got going it was hard to put down.  All the twists and turns made sense and were exciting enough to make you want to see what was next.  The ending left you hanging.  I had a better ending in mind.  Much better.  It did leave the story hanging for a second book but I probably wouldn't read it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really cool game. When I played temple run 1 I thought the part when if you died how they said jokes I liked that. This is a really cool game I hope you enjoy it.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Fast shipping. Dvd is great quality. Son-in-law loves it. Was his Christmas present last year. Matthew has the looks and the brains to pull off the savvy kind of lawyer that this role requires-someone asked to do the wrong thing for the wrong reason and find a way to exonerate himself  yet make sure his client gets justice in the end. Great movie.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|Powerful Movie. This movie has it all Great Characters, Wonderful Actors, Beautiful Cinematography and Great Story. If you have not seen this film yet you are in for a treat. First thing you need to do is throw away any of the crazy things that Mel Gibson has been doing and saying in recent years and enjoy the film for what it is. There need to be more movies like this one, thats for sure.
0061122416|5.0|Why does this book deserve five stars?  First, is Coelho's style.  Secondly, his believability.  Third, character development.  Fourth, presentation of universal truths.  Fifth, it is difficult to put down.  That about covers it.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|I Love it! And Ryan Reynolds! It was such a fun movie to watch, I was laughing the whole time!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Starts great then slows down to a crawl as it mainly consists of characters talking about what they are going to do. King throws a \\"twist\\" about 3/4 in for no real reason. It's not a terrible read. It had its moments and a great concept but is a bit disappointing
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|Some great remixes but I'd like a little more traditional Donna.  Hopefully we'll be getting some of her unreleased material in the near future.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|Shallow plot.  Way too predictable.  Stereotypes abound. Eye candy of graphics is the only redeeming value to this story.  If the plot were as detailed and rich as the graphics, this movie would be top notch!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting plot but somewhat repetitive and drawn-out.  The author reveals dark personalities that can co-exist within seemingly &#34;normal&#34; people.  Relationships are shown to actually feed-off the good, as well as the bad in each person, enduring in spite of the characters' psychoses
B00E95ED32|5.0|Great CD! love Hunter Hayes...although he is young...great singer and entertainer.  If you like pop country you will love this CD
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Such a long novel, but well worth the time spent reading. I love having a digital version that I can take with me without having to lug an almost 1,000 page boo around! It is full of history -- and an exciting story to boot. Love it!
0792833279|5.0|Very funny in a very cool way. I love John Travalto,  Dennis Farina and gene Hackman. I guess I love the acting of the whole cast!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's got a few little glitches here and there, but honestly... for $35 what do you want? Turn a dumb TV into a smart TV lickety split!
B00DAABKQK|5.0|I love the story theme and the acting of Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. Also, the score is awesome!! I think I try to purchase the soundtrack. Is it for sale?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh my god<br />Oh my god<br />Oh my god<br />Oh my god<br /> This book made me cry for the first time in over a year<br />Oh my god
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This cd is awesome! It has a variety of sounds, but Eminem works his magic on this album. His lyrics are incredible and remind of some of his older material. This is a must have for any fan of his. My favorite track is #9 Rap God-WOW! I've listened to the album multiple times already, and it keeps getting better and better. I don't listen to rap very often since I grew up in the 80s/90s era and don't think rap these days is that good, but Eminem is a great artist and I'll continue follow his music. I hope he continues to create and amaze with his music and rhymes for many years to come.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it! It does everything that i would like it to do i am so glad i can have it on my Kindle.  I have been playing it on my andorid phone.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gorgeous writing. A lovely story and highly recommended for young adults especially. Wish it was not so short though, it ended all to soon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is my favorite game. very addictive. i love candy crush. idk wat else to write im just taking up space lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i can finally play this game on my kindle,and stop using up my data usage on my phone,thank you so much
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|I think it's Katy Perry's best work yet!  Listening to Prism is just plain fun.  I definitely recommend this download.
1596434252|5.0|An absolutely beautiful book. I purchased this book for my grandmother and she adores it. Young and old alike, this book is crowd-pleaser.
B00DW475CC|5.0|I'm glad WB released this on Blu-ray and in time for Christmas. The quality is quite good and better than the DVD, but I think the video could've been better. The audio sounds great without any volume changing throughout the film. As for the video, the quality for further away shots is really good with great sharpness and when the shot is up close it doesn't seem to be as good as I thought it would be. I'm sad there wasn't any special features except the trailer. I also wish WB would put a little more effort in the Menu part and not having just simple icons. Overall this is a pretty good Blu-ray release and I would recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game was a fantastic novel filled with adventure and the great fight between good and bad. What the people want and what you want. Truly a thought provoking read!<br />The portrayal of young Ender retains what I believe are the two more important parts of the novel, and this remains consistent without halting character development, is that Ended is /only/ a kid. Yes he may have astounding abilities but he's just that. I love how Card manages to keep that thought in the back of your head the entire time.<br />(Spoilers ahead!)<br />I believe the pinnacle of what makes this book so fantastic is the endgame in which we learn it was all real the war they fought in the \\"simulation\\". I for one was astounded by the reveal that the game was not a game at all. Even further of a surprise was the point at which Enter discovers the remade version of \\"The Game\\". The explanation and overall emotions coming from ender at this point among many others was certainly breathtaking.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I found myself deeply engrossed in this novel, as if it had pulled me out of my self and I was watching the events unfold in a movie. Interestingly and uniquely written, with a powerful message attached. Looking forward to reading more from Jay!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very good read! I had a hard time putting it down. I would read another by the same author.
B002APU580|5.0|One of the best books from the last century.  I also love the movie which is very close to the book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Equestria girls update is awesome!<br />Because you can dance as an equestria girl and umm.... it's too cool!! Buy it!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|A replacement for old VHS that I have not had time to get rid off.  The movie series is excellent and I enjoy having them.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great !  Large numbers make it so easy to read.  Handy and simple to use. My Kindle now lives on my desk when I,m not  taking pictures, playing games or reading my most current e book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I've had Ender's Game on my reading list for some time now and  while I am an avid reader at heart my kindle fell into disuse for many months through no fault if it's own until I saw the first trailer for Ender's Game on TV. In 20 seconds I felt the rush and excitement that truly inspired science fiction provides and in that moment I had begun a mission to relocate my kindle and read Ender's Game well in advance of the movie release.<br />The last time this kind of inspired quest to read a book was when I saw the fist trailer for the Hunger Games. Though my age, gender and lifestyle as a young academic left me little time to explore the fashions in contemporary pop fiction fandom since the Harry Potter craze ended, I could tell that someone had cracked the code between great storytelling aimed at a young audience in mind, body and spirit, and creating a film that would properly respect the literature while simultaneously striving towards an unapologetic ethos in cinematic excellence. These are the kinds of major blockbuster pictures that I can understand regarding the heft of an incredible production budget. These are the kinds of movies that make me want to go to the theater. I want to be wowed. I want my personal imagination to be impressed, and no three actors like Ben Kingsley, Harrison Ford and Viola Davis could grab my attention so acutely as to the gravity of this narrative in the span of 20 seconds.<br />So while I just saw the movie today and am thoroughly impressed by the result I feel that some of my underlying questions about the book are now succinctly resolved enough for me to continue reading the series with the excitement I lacked from reading the novel itself. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it immensely but it made a minor myosin vestment to me in its explanation of the future Earth in a way that felt dated to Cold War era geopolitics. It's not an unfamiliar problem at all. Ursula LeGuin remarks upon this kind of reliance of technocratic futurist astrology in her introduction to the Left Hand of Darkness. Let me explain the problem of the book this way. If The Hunger Games was written for an intended audience of young women in the first decade of the 21st century, then by comparison Ender's Game was written for young men in the 1960's or 70's. From my perspective I could read through them both with ease and enjoyment because they were fun, exciting, edgy, dark and sexy. Ender's Game's only downfall is its mild Cold War dating. The kind of fashion that slips slightly out of grasp because in a world where China's population is decimated Card still presented a Soviet block future to the euro-Asian continents. If he presented a gamble on the future, something unexpected yet plausible on our planet, where a third world country suddenly dominates the world for  and one of a great number of scenarios then the assumptions about our world fifty years after alien genocide would seem to have a touch of verisimilitude. If Card needed the Cold War to survive in his future he didn't really do much more than expound on what must have been a rather deep rooted fear in the Soviet block that it would survive even alien assault and lead to WWIII in rebuilding? It's like Clarke's 2010 was part of this historic lineage. Despite my weak rambling about an issue that I feel separates my father's generation from my own, Ender's Game does explore issues about genius, the military space school and big brother in very intriguing light. Even his use of computers is brilliant. He provides just enough for it to manifest in an ethereal, divine manner I found most comforting because in my view Card turned it into the oracle no one knew existed. There are a lot of great reasons to read this book. Many more than I will share. But I hope you have the opportunity to explore it yourself. I'm looking forward to my next break in work to tear through the second in the series with relish.
B0060CV31C|5.0|This is the best kids movie ever!!!!!  I love to watch it time and time again.  It's definitely kid friendly!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Beautiful storytelling and very creative. The story of a young girl in WWII Germany with a twist. A nice read.
0143123173|5.0|...and it is only a matter of time until I catch up to you.  However, until that time, I, as a new member of the Longmire fan clan, will enjoy reading through all of the rest of the novels in this series.  Eventually, I will have to wait (im)patiently for the next book, as do all the veteran loyalists.<br /><br />I loved Craig Johnson's debut novel, The Cold Dish, for a lot of reasons.  I spent a half of my childhood living in Cheyenne, and his vivid writing lets me re-experience Wyoming just as I remember it, through all my senses.  That alone is worth the read for me.  As a 50 year old man, I thoroughly get and enjoy Johnson's (often craftily nuanced) cultural references.  I love how creative he is with his characters.  I enjoy and appreciate his savvy, spare, and precise use of language and words.  I really like how he's not afraid to play around with form and delivery, always changing things up like a professional pitcher.  I appreciate how skillfully and thoughtfully he embraces and shares the current state of Indian life in the Mountain West, and how well he challenges and even shatters myths and stereotypes.  Of course, Johnson does all of this while weaving a gripping mystery--one even a slow reader like me cannot easily walk away from (this book cost me all the football games and a lot of sleep this past weekend).<br /><br />Okay, I am off to start Death Without Company.  I've got some catching up to do!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The beginning and the end of the novel are two very different stories. I read this in about ten minutes...a very addictive book!
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great game. Super easy to learn and challenging to play. We have taught our 4 year old niece to play it so it I am confident anyone can learn. The game times can be fairly short so it is a good party game. I also play a solitaire version that can be quite fun. I would strongly recommend this along with the other versions of the game to anyone looking for quick, fun game that you can come back to again and again.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|Great movie! Well written, well acted, well directed, well casted. This is one of my favorite movies and cannot wait to introduce it to my granddaughter !
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I bought this book at the same time I bought Under the Dome..  JEEEZ!  I did not realize how long they both were!  After reading Under the Dome, I tackled this million page monster.  Again though, it didn't feel like I was reading War and Peace.  This book is awesome!  I could not wait to get back to reading almost as soon as I stopped for the night.  It has history, a brilliant premise, and a very realstic ending.  Great book.  highly recommended!
1250030951|5.0|THIS BOOK Y'ALL!!! I don't know how to review it without melting into a puddle of girly, happy tears. And I don't usually do that. I could really connect with this book because Cath reminds me of the way I was when I started college. She is shy and a bit scared of meeting new people and dealing with new situations which I totally understand. I started out as the girl who wasn't sure about leaving her room but I was lucky to find a good group of friends and soon I was out on midnight adventures on campus. It is through Reagan and Levi that Cath is able to find this same type of home whether it is making snarky observations with Reagan at dinner or reading Fanfiction with Levi. I love the growth we see in Cath over the course of the novel and how we slowly see her let go of her fictitious world and embrace the real world around her.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Levi. Wonderful, quirky, adorable Levi. I want one. By the end of the book I just wanted to carry him away and have him be forever mine. The fact that he is fictional be damned. Levi is a good ol' Nebraska boy who lives on a farm and has a smile that could light up a room and is determined to bring Cath out of her shell. He is endearing and loveable and Rowell has created a boy that swiftly moved up my book crush list with every page. &#60;3 I could say more but it would just be senseless gushing. Loved him.<br /><br />Despite the previous paragraph, my favorite thing about Fangirl was actually that it wasn't wholly a cute love story but that it also focused on how hard things like growing up, dealing with family, and growing into your own, can really be. In the course of the novel Cath has to deal with her fathers slow crumbling, her sisters acting out, and her mother trying to reenter her life. Rowell writes these situations with such raw emotion that they feel very true to life and in no way feel fabricated or fictional. Cath's quiet strength and ever present doubt makes her a multi-faceted character thatI grew to respect and love.<br /><br />Fangirl was a home-run for Rowell. I laughed, I cried, I stopped and did a few happy jigs while being quietly judged by my chihuahua. It was a book I was truly sad to see the end of and I really hope *fingers crossed* that this isn't the last we see of Cath and Levi.<br /><br />Star Count: 4.5 - The only reason Fangirl isn't getting the full five stars is because the Simon Snow fanfiction sprinkled throughout the novel pulled me out of the story at certain points. I ended up simply skimming most of it. But other than that I loved the novel. I had all of the warm fuzzies and feels. The struggle of Cath coming into her own was familiar and real. And Levi. *Swoon* Enough said.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I love this watch!  It looks great, the weight on my arm is great, and I get compliments all of the time on this watch.  The only issue I have, and it is my own issue, is that as a self winding watch, if I don't wear it for a day or so, I have to reset the time and date.  A minor annoyance that could be easily fixed with an automatic watch winder.  All in all a wonderful watch.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|super fun and addictive, find myself on longer then I intend. Def worth buying specially sense it's free. So you should try it out
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Another brilliant album by the Arcade Fire. Tons of reviews are saying that this is a dance album, but don't be fooled. the melancholied-pop songs are there! The song Afterlife could easily be included in the Neon Bible album. Some are saying that there's a lack of bass on some of the songs, which I tend to agree, however I think that it works on some songs allowing the rhythm to flow uninterrupted.<br /><br />Like all Arcade Fire albums, you have to listen to all of it, from beginning to end. There seems to be a continuous trend in the songs.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Hands down best motivational man movie from a point of view that says as men we have to stand up and fight for what we believe even against the odds IMO
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is just spot on awesome. I love this game all the things u can create and think of. Its just one of my all time faorite game ever

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|In a word, excellent!!!! Even if you have a good relationship you'll learn a lot! There are a ton of ideas here that can help keep a relationship stay on the towards being great.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I had no problem with the supposed surprise ending to one of the characters, but the writing of this installment was sub par. The story line of Divergent along with Insurgent captured me right away, but I struggled to get invested in Allegiant. I felt obligated to continue reading to see how this trilogy would end, but this book had too many ideas going on that weren't given a chance to develop. Hopefully, if there is a prequel that comes out, it will harken back to the writing style of Divergent.
B0047BBWFK|1.0|Fast shipping. The vinyl was in good condition and not warped. The sound from the vinyl is much better than the CD and very well recorded.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|it was exciting and made it hard to put down.  ready for the next one.  had lots of action and family bonds.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|Great CD<br /><br />I have always loved Elton John and this CD is one of his best.  I recommend it to everyone!
B00FMAZ49U|4.0|Unfortunately, as good as some people say SPIGEN is...this product is unfinished. There is only one hole cut out for the ear speaker. The front facing camera and the sensor are covered by it. I haven't put it on, nor have I tested it. Don't really want to go through the trouble if there's even a 1% chance it doesn't work. I'm getting my return label ready. Won't stop buying from SPIGEN, but all buyers might want to wait till they can release a good product and not try to be the first to market.<br /><br />EDIT: They're good. And as good as just the screen. Im still terrible about not having bubbles but that's user error. Buy away.
B00742BVW8|5.0|GREAT PLOT, GREAT ACTING, IRONY ABOUNDS AND A REALISTIC ENDING THAT CONFORMS TO CHINESE<br />HISTORY AND CULTURAL PRECEPTS!!  OOPS! . . . I FORGOT! . . . THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS OUTSTANDING IN THIS<br />FILM, WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR A CHINESE MOVIE.  THE CHINESE HAVE TRULY ENTERED THE 21st CENTURY WITH A<br />ROAR!!!!!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Very good movie excellent acting. Good match of actors for each charater. More movies need to have the well thought script.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I have enjoyed all three Fire Maple games. They are interesting, challenging and enjoyable.  I like the fact that there are no hidden object games. The hint button will get you through those times when you are stuck. Looking forward to the next one!
B00CHS31DG|1.0|This game was offered on the free today list. We decided to try it. HOWEVER, we could not figure out what it was supposed to do, nor how to use it or read it. Very disappointing.
0307120007|5.0|My best friend gave this to me for my baby over 30 years ago and it continues to be a classic! I bought it for my daughter when she was expecting her own child.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Compared to the other CD's, I can honestly say that I love all the songs. I love their new style, but I still love their older songs as well. This just really gets me excited about what they'll be coming out with next.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is different sort of sci-fi....it's not outer space, star wars, star trek stuff, it is set here on earth in an underground silo.  It is quite entertaining as the story slowly (and I mean slowly) unfolds as to what the silo is and the truth of what exists outside on the surface. Not a lot of action at all but a lot of character building. Not for those who like a lot of action but for those who like a good story and characters.
B00FX8EY60|1.0|I bought this for my daughter.  I typically can handle Katy Perry. However, this album was awful. It was almost uncomfortable to listen to. I had it in and my daughter didn't know I had bought it. She asked Who The HECK is this?! It's awful!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it!  I can finally watch my favortie Bollywood Netflix movies on the big screen now!  Easy to use! Awesome!

B0025KVLTC|5.0|It's not my favorite Beatles album, but it's close. In a world where &#34;game-changer&#34; is used too freely, this was truly a game-changer.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great action flick love all of the superheroes in this one especially love when hulk pummels Loki and calls him puny god
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I don't think this will hold up to multiple viewings as well as the 2009 movie (I have watched that movie so many times), but still good. I can't say enough good things about Benedict Cumberbatch.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|22Learn brings another awesome app to parents. This one, Alphabet Aquarium, helps your child to recognize letters and their sounds. The game has four different levels in which the child uses shape based puzzles to match objects, build letter or animals, and more.<br />The game helps the lesson along with constant repetition, so that your child can easily recall what he or she has learned. The game includes bright colors and excellent graphics which are sure to delight your child. This is one of the best apps that I have seen for toddlers learning their ABCs. This easily worth 5 times what they are charging for the app. The information your child gathers from this app will allow them to pick up more complicated tasks, such as reading, at a faster pace.<br />This app is great if you are on the go, whether it be a holiday trip to grandma's or waiting at the doctor's office. This app is sure to have your little one entertained for hours, The best part is that they get to have fun as they learn .

B009NY43NY|1.0|If you're teaching fiction, you can use this book as an example of an author manipulating her characters to fit her predetermined agenda and not the world she originally created. A good author knows when to follow the events her characters have set in motion; this author does not. Readers saw--and criticized--the sudden, unjustified changes in characters and events. It's too bad that Harris and her editor were so much less perceptive.
1250038820|5.0|Somehow, in the simple act of following his bliss, Brandon has tapped into a piece of what it means to harness human potential. Captivating millions around the world with his photographs and mini-interviews, he has synchronized many small acts of kindness into great cumulative offerings of support and solidarity. Will HONY save the world? Probably not. BUT..if we all found away to follow our hearts and inspire the people around us to love other human beings more fully both in our words and deeds we might turn out alright.
0515149489|1.0|I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. She just could not have written this boring book. It took me 6 weeks to get 1/2 way through it. Then It sounded like Criminal Minds killing young women on a plastic sheet to bury them. UGH!  I just couldn't read about that anymore than I can watch Criminal Minds.  I threw the book away it kept making me fall asleep. I was so very disappointed \\"The Search\\" came from one of my favorite authors. I agree with Boo HOO for this one.

B0084FMBDM|5.0|I have worn Teva sandals for many years.  My feet sweat and covered shoes are an inconvenience.  Luckily I live in South Florida, where footwear is casual.  When I replace them every four or five years it is only because they look worn.  They are still quite useable.  Only caveat, be careful with your toes.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad it was put on the kindle fire it's a lot more fun on it than on a ipod. I hope that kindle will continue to get games that are on Apple products.

B00FRMCYQ4|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. My son still hasn't watched it through, he gets bored with it. Talladega Nights of kids movies without the humor.
B000URWYTS|2.0|I had to stop reading it halfway through.  It was based on the true story about two extremely selfish people, Frank Llyod Wright and  Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who claimed to love their young children, and yet abandoned them, leaving them in the care of others.  Mamah, did not see her children for two years, by her own choice.  It was just hard to read.  I felt that the author was trying to justify her choices , and make her a sympathetic character, which made the book even more distasteful.  As a mother I was just horrified. I am a big fan of FLW's architecture, which is why I picked up this book in the first place. I had read and enjoyed \\"The Women\\", so I knew he wasn't the husband or father of the year, but I guess it was the sympathetic tone of this book that disturbed me.,
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think its  fun to build stuff out of blocks, but it would be nice to have more things to build with.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The sadness yet the hope shines ever so brightly as you feel the lives of every character in this book
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Very entertaining-on the edge of your seat movie!  I actually watched it twice because other family members wanted to see it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I got to level 64, completed getting all the jellies &amp; got the required 220,000 points, but, then the game wanted me to again clear all the jellies but now had to get a score of 310,000.  Finally I got all the jellies again with a score of 358,000. I thought great, I can move on to the next level, wrong, the game wants me to get the same score I just got. Frustrating!!! In the meantime, I asked friends to unlock the next level, it recognizes two friends but sends out the wrong message time after time &amp; the only way I can get to the next level is by paying my .99 cents.  What a rip off!!! My kindle fire (Amazon) sure has a racket going. At least it was easy to delete from my tablet!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show has to be one of the greatest tv shows to date. I recommend anyone  who likes the medieval era to watch this show.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I could barely get a few chapters into this book before I wanted my money back. Knowing that this is a pre-teen-level book was still not enough to prepare me for the low quality of writing and character development. Cliches abounded, painfully. I would like to give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that the story becomes quite good further into the book--my rationale being that they decided to make a silver screen adaptation of the story line--however, I don't believe I will be reading the book to find out. Similarly, reviews of the movie were unimpressive.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Very good game.  The graphics are somewhat impressive.  My 8 year old can play it with no issues and loves it.
0345803493|3.0|Hard to put down and interesting in parts but not a &#34;great&#34; book.  I can see the attraction and popularity.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is completely addictive.  My entire family loves playing this.  Even the 3 year old.  It's a very easy game for little kids to understand, yet challenging enough for adults.  Just be aware, if you have any issues with motion sickness, this may make you a little queasy.  I can't play it for very long because of that.  :(
B0045HCJSK|5.0|this movie is really good and a must for your dvd shelf due to it has john wayne,dean martin, and ricky nelson
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is simply the best live album of all time! It was Zeppelin at its finest moment between the early days and the later. Robert Plant still has a voice that is electrifying and Page is very, very explosive as well as harmonious. Jones and Bonham lay down the foundation of what is the Greatest Band of All Time.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|The remastered versions are clear, and I have enjoyed watching them again after all these years since it was first aired.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the best purchases I've made in my life! I highly recommend this device to anyone and everyone. Cheers!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|not as good as some but better than others. I read #2 first and am waiting for #3. interested in how they will escape from WP and how they will survive outside.
B00338QENI|5.0|Completely fascinating. This book is read by the fictitious Newport Ladies Book Club (women's fiction series), and I was drawn in by the first chapter. It's an incredible story of a woman who changed the face of medical science as her cancer cells continue to multiply and live, providing research capabilities. Her life is amazing, and she made the greatest sacrifice of all.
B008QOI0ZE|5.0|Amazing in HD.  I had never seen this in a theater, only on conventional TV.  In HD is it incredible  -- I see details I never saw before.  A great film.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I felt this book was a good read. I truly love John Grisham, as a author and I look forward to his releases.  The characters and the plot kept me in suspense throughout the whole book. A great read.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Wow! These alternative versions are even better than the originals, in my opinion. Some songs are truncated but others are more expansive. I guess Dylan's producers back when these takes were recorded went with what they thought best captured his talent, but this release and the awe it has generated with Dylan fans may have proved them wrong.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I have never been so obsessed with a book. I felt every happy moment and heartbreak right along with America. I couldn't stop thinking about the characters in school. I can't wait until May for the next book!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book has easy to follow step-by-step directions for converting your ebook for Kindle. Indispensable! So glad I read it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book reads just like a good historic military non-fiction. Engrossing from the first page. Won't spoil the movie and won't be spoiled by the movie. They are both different and both great. Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad there is a restriction on lives or I would hardly ever put the device down. Music is cheesy though
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Awesome game!  Fun and addicting.  Great role play.  I can't wait for the next version.  Dungeon Hunter 5 will definitely be on my &quot;can't wait to play&quot; list.  Keep turning out awesome games like D H 4.
B00G32PQNA|2.0|The least interesting of the three part series. After many years of marriage, the protagonists are tired of each other and though that often happens in life, it does not make an interesting movie.
B00000DCHI|3.0|I actually picked up [[ASIN:B00DJYKDCE Greatest Hits Volume III]] shortly before this, and the sound quality is noticeably inferior here. That disc was remastered a year earlier in 1997. At first I thought maybe it's just that the recordings are older here, but in fact some songs from the same album ([[ASIN:B0054YHAXC An Innocent Man]]) overlap both collections and they have much more bass and clarity on Volume III.    Having said that, the big plus here is that all tracks are now full-length and it's still a fantastic collection, worth adjusting the EQ a bit to make up for the slightly inferior mastering.    Edit: a year later I'm listening to this again with my [[ASIN:B00HVLUR86 Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones]] and it's obvious what's wrong. Some kind of noise reduction software was used in the remastering process and it has killed the high end and given the whole thing a dull, lifeless sound. Very disappointing. I've dropped my review from 4 to 3 stars.
B000OVLINI|4.0|I had a hard time getting hooked on this book, but I'm glad I pursued and finished. I may look for more by this author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive and so much fun! Be careful with running out of lives in this game. It will cost you if you don't ask your friends for help.
B007QXWV1U|4.0|I would recommend this app. It's easy to use and the options are worth it. I read reviews and they weren't favorable for the most part. I have Kindle Fire HD and it works great. Lots of fun and think it's worth the money.. Download pic's from Facebook, photo's, etc. Loads of fun for the whole family!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|WOW! this album is everything you'd expect from a classic Stryper album but updated, modern, and fresh. the band sounds amazing!!! so glad i got this cd!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Intense. Captivating. Holds your attention.  Can not wait for the second book!<br />First time I have read her work.<br />Read it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|You'll stay hooked from start to finish! I was not familiar with this author before this book but now I'm an instant fan.
0060786523|4.0|a beautifully written book, but extremely long. I took off a star for its length, even though it is beaufifully written and a great story it could have been shorter.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent character development. I am now a huge fan of this author because of the engrossing storyline. This was a book I didn't want to put down. I'm now reading Sharp Objects which is equally as compelling.
0140177191|5.0|fantastic book, with an empowering twist on the classic Arthurian legend, told from the perspective of Morgan LeFay. I highly recommend this book.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|Review Originally Posted At: The Y.A. Bookworm Blogger<br /><br />Sentinel definitely made my list of most anticipated 2013 releases! I was so excited to get back to these characters I've grown to adore but at the same time, I was hoping the day wouldn't arrive so I wouldn't ever have to say farewell to my Covenant family. Although I don't think I'd consider Sentinel to be my favourite book from the series (Apollyon has my vote there), I wasn't at all disappointed with it; I'm actually quite happy with the way Jennifer ended off this series!<br /><br />  After being broken apart (quite literally) by Ares, Alex, Aiden, Seth and the gang are determined to defeat Ares once and for all.....if only it were that easy. To have any chance at winning against Ares, Alex and Aidan must travel to the underworld to release Perses, the Titan god of destruction who thrives on the bloodshed of battle. Releasing Perses may be their only option, but Alex can't help wondering whether releasing him will cause them more problems then they had before.<br /><br />One of the Covenant series most addicting qualities is its comedic theme. All of the characters have a unique personality and wit to them that give them each a rare ability to make me laugh-- making me love them even more! This is especially true with secondary characters like Deacon and Apollo who add something so unique to this series compared to many other YA reads. Somehow, Apollo and Deacon always seem to pop up at the &#34;worst&#34; times (usually, frustratingly so, at the start of some steamy Alex and Aiden scenes. ;) and I'm always unsure as to whether I want to lock them in a room or hug them to death because of their ability to make me giggle whenever they're around! They're those kinds characters you love to pretend to hate because their &#34;annoying&#34; (AKA, HILARIOUS), but don't really hate at all :P ....Confusing description, but oh so true !<br /><br />Alex and Aiden are honestly one of those super couples that are hard to come by. They're both independently tough and able to kick anybody's ass, but together they are a force to be reckoned with. Almost all of my favourite covenant scenes are from those in which Aiden and Alex lean on and completely open up to one another. When I think back to the two of them from Half Blood and compare them to the people they are now, they're relationship has made them stronger, mature and more vulnerable in the best way possible (I always enjoy looking back and examining how far characters have come since first &#34;meeting&#34; them). Throughout these past 5 novels, they've made me swoon more times than I can count and thankfully, Sentinel continued this beautiful pattern-- there's plenty of new swoony material  in Senintel that we'll be able to look back on when we need our Aiden and Alex fix....<br /><br />Jennifer L. Armentrout almost made me have a heart attack with the way she chose to end Sentinel. I have just recently finished reading Allegiant and I almost felt it was going to be a horrific repeat (and can I just say, Allegiant has scarred me and  made me skeptical of any &#34;series concluding&#34; novels)! Thankfully (I do mean, THANKFULLY), I can say that the way the Covenant series ended has left me completely satisfied and hopeful that someday, somehow this won't be the end of Alex and Aiden.

0345803485|1.0|not sure what the big deal is, there's definitely more exciting literature out there, and this is demeaning to women. basically the message is that it's exciting to be treated disrespectfully and we have spent too much time fighting that crap to think it's sexy. I don't recommend any of the series.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is definitely one of the hardest novels I've had to review in quite some time....and that's mostly because my feelings for Allegiant are, as they say, all over the place! I desperately wanted to be able to write this review and be &#34;frolicking through fields&#34; as I told you how great it was, but I can't lie bookworms, I'm kind of heartbroken and disappointed with it.<br /><br />I'm sure by now it's no secret to any of you that Allegiant is told in both Tris and Four's perspective. Initially when I heard this news, I was super excited to get a further glimpse into Four's mind. However, although I did enjoy seeing his perspective (especially in regards to what he feels and sees when he looks at Tris) I found his &#34;voice&#34; wasn't all that different from Tris', which made it a little confusing at times to tell whose POV I was reading from when I forgot to look at the chapter title. Once I reached the end of Allegiant (after I dried up my tears.....for the millionth time) I realized how important it was to have Four's perspective thrown in there. I will say that although some people found Four to be a bit annoying in Allegiant, I really loved seeing that vulnerability within him shine through and I think that is one of the reasons why Allegiant 's ending was so hard to deal with.<br /><br />  Tris and Four continued to be one of my favourite kick-ass, bring-it-on couples that still manage to make me swoon over their beautiful connection.They had a mix of both affectionate and distant moments-- and my one complaint would have to be the fact that their trust in one another continued to be tested in Allegiant. I found this element to their relationship a little annoying because I thought this was an obstacle they had already dealt with and resolved in Insurgent. The one thing I really love about these two is that although they are stronger together, they're both still independent on their own. I was particularly impressed to see Tris stand up against Four when he made a not so smart decision and not be afraid to throw it in his face. Tris is one of the strongest and bravest heroines I've ever read about and she proves that on numerous occasions!<br /><br />  Now comes the hard part.....the ending.....*takes deep breath to hold in the waterfall made from my tears* I'm sure by now most of you who are reading this already know from either reading the novel or through spoilers what happens at the end of Allegiant, but I 'm going to try and keep this spoiler free anyways. I know that over the past week or so there have been those who are upset/angry with the ending and those who are defending Veronica Roth's right to end the series the way she always intended to. Although I completely agree that Veronica has absolutely no obligation to make me as a reader happy, that doesn't mean I'm obligated to be happy with how she chooses to do so. At first, I was pretty angry (and obviously heartbroken) over how this incredible series ended, but after some time, I am now just really numb about it. The soul of the series has been ripped away and that really has effected how I look back on the series as a whole. I don't know if I'll ever be able to look back on the happy moments without focusing on the ending I know that's in store for these characters. There are those that look at the ending as a display of bravery that wraps up the series beautifully, but I can't help but look at it as a tragic and heart breaking ending that takes away the theme of hope that I loved so much about this series. I'm definitely disappointed and even more so heartbroken----when I finished Allegiant, I had the whole &#34;quivering lips, big fat tears&#34; thing going on for a good hour (not even exaggerating)....I'm still in a mourning period. ...<br /><br />Overall, my thoughts on Allegiant are definitely not positive even though I enjoyed a majority of this novel up until its ending. I'm filled with anger and shock, but mostly disappointment that these characters I've grown to love in such a consuming way didn't get the ending I thought they deserved. The more and more I think about it, the less satisfied I am. I'm now not sure whether I'd be able to recommend this series to anyone in the future because as great as 95% of this series was, that last 5% makes me want to erase this series from my mind so I wouldn't have to deal with the pain I'm currently going through. It's unfortunate to see a series end in a way that divides the fandom so much due to it's controversy as opposed to bringing us together for closure.aracters I've grown to love in such a consuming way didn't get the ending I thought they deserved.

B0084TWN9K|5.0|I'd long heard of but never read Alice Munro until Dear Life:  Stories.  And life stories are exactly what Ms. Munro writes so well.  Capturing the human element of characters to whom anyone can relate at one point or another, Dear Life: Stories provides a set of excellent short tales.  As the length of the stories often matched the length of my daily ferry commute, I would often finish one just with a few minutes of down time during which I was left thinking and reflecting on the story I had just read perhaps in a way I don't normally reflect.  It's that reflection I came to enjoy and for which I would recommend Dear Life: Stories to any fan of literature.  I heard this might be Ms. Munro's last work, but as my first Munro work, I look forward to reading her others.  Thank you Ms. Munro for providing such fine literary diversion!
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|Very good advices for who wants to try to go remote (even just for some days a week). If you are already working remotely since some time you'll find a lot of things you already know. Anyway you could find some little things to improve your daily experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Hazel is a model character we would all like to emulate and thus book was a nice vacation to a difficult world where all are equal.  A great reminder of our own mortality and a nice love story to boot.  My old English teachers would appreciate the Shakespeare references.  Highly recommended.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Realistic and heartbreaking movie. Well directed and pretty good special effects. Showed not only the soldiers battle side but the family side back home.

B00ESY7QXI|2.0|My girlfriend an I watched this for about 35 minutes and we did't have a clue what it was about. Good cast and great setting but story? Who knows...............
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book as part of a book club. My younger cousin (she is 13) recommended this book because her mother was having trouble thinking of one. I went into it thinking I was reading a book geared towards younger kids. I was wrong. This book is one of the most uplifting and devastating books I have ever read, if that makes any sense. The characters are written perfectly. The emotion this book evokes is unbelievable. I've cried while reading books before....I SOBBED during this one. If you want a happy story, with a happy ending, this isn't your book. But if you want a book that gives you the nitty gritty emotions that go along with people that are terminally ill, with a somewhat humorous spin, this is your book.
B00947N6D8|3.0|the movie cannot play smoothly because there are scratch on its surface. should not buy the second hand cd or dvd online because you don't know the quality of it and they don't check it carefully
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game. However, be prepared to become addicted. I like the fact that you can still play even if you don't invite friends or buy any of the extras.
B00447L4KA|4.0|I am a huge fan of 80s movies and bought this movies. it came right away and was brand new. worth the $

B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Digging into the depths of how affirmations work, author Jonathan Bello delivers a powerful, applicable resource for readers. Each chapter addresses a different type of affirmation, including such topics as self-worth, career, financial gain, among others, coupled with examples readers can meditate on and use for practical purpose. Overall, it’s a great tool for anyone looking for a down-to-earth approach to mental wellness.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Entertaining and inspirational it tells the story of one man's struggle with his demons. As a former pilot I thought it showed the humanity and arrogance of the profession.

1883217040|4.0|The Jazz Theory book is very useful as a reference and study guide.  I have theory books all over the place, so having all this information in one binder is golden.  It won't take the place of an experienced teacher, but will support one quite well.  I find that I carry it with me when I travel.  It's very helpful where ever I practice and increases my knowledge of harmony with each reading.  This is a must have for any serious musician.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a simple and pleasurable book. Someday, I hope a movie is made that closely follows the book.

1936891026|5.0|I heard the interview w/Oprah on SuperSoul Sunday & had to get it...It is a great book filled w/ truths..if you are searching it will resonate w/you!<br />PEACE
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Very pretty case, I get lots of compliments whenever I bring it to school or work. It isnt the most secure, especially after I had an expensive Belkin (which broke) but it does the job. I would not but it in a purse or book bag, because the top flap goes everywhere and bends, exposing the front of the kindle. I know later on I will end up paying more money for a more secure case, but if you are looking for short term use or you know you wont be carrying it around or traveling with it a lot, this case is for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very happy that I can play my favorite game on my kindle. I just continue where I left off. great.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|It's a nice looking bumper and it fights snugly with all the buttons lining up perfectly but, like any case, it makes the phone feel a lot larger than it truly is.  I feel like it'll eventually stretch out from removing the phone periodically to clean all the pocket lint that gathers in gaps between it and the phone, but so far it's held up.  Despite some moderate abuse it's held up very well with no visible scuffs or wearing.
1577314808|5.0|Number Nine in self-help that tells you something. I have yet to finish this book however it made me feel connected to the moment. This book taught me not to worry about the past or the future but instead how to live in the now comfortably.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD because I was looking for something to help me get started on my journey to losing my I'm-having-a-baby-so-I-can-eat-anything-I-want weight, about 45 pounds of it. I prefer yoga but I know I'm going to need more than that to get this weight off, and I need something quick that I can do while my kids nap and still have time to switch out loads of laundry, pay bills, etc. I also haven't had a proper workout since before I had my first child, almost 2 1/2 years ago, so I knew any workout I attempted would be difficult, so why not just take the plunge?<br /><br />Today was day one, so this review is based on first impressions.<br />When the DVD starts Jillian tells you she is very tough. This is not an understatement. I began on level 1, doing the modified poses for beginners and using no weights. She starts with a quick warm up, but I am so out of shape that I was already starting to feel that burn start by the end of the WARM UP!<br />At 5 minutes in to the workout I was cussing her. At 10 minutes I started to fall off pace, simply unable to jump every now and then, needing a quick rest here and there. Around 15 minutes I knew I was close to the end but my body was just saying no, my wobbly legs would not lift me off the ground for jumping. Then Jillian said something like she knows you want to quit and just turn the DVD off right now, but the end is where you do the most good and to just keep pushing. I couldn't believe it but her words really helped me when I was about to stop. I pushed harder and felt a burst of strength come through my body and I finished the workout! She really did motivate me then, and she has a lot of the same talk through-out. I really enjoyed her tough-love approach.<br /><br />So how was it? Awful. Do I want to do it tomorrow? Yes!<br />After the cool down I sat on the couch for a couple minutes and then got up to get some more water, thinking my legs felt pretty good. Walking back to the couch my legs felt like they mightgive out. The burn lasted long after the workout. I expect that my muscles will feel like they've been put through the grinder tomorrow, but I also know that if I keep pushing myself through this workout (and stick to my diet) that I will start seeing results in no time.
0062082841|5.0|This is a fascinating look into the genius of Guillermo del Toro. Every page turn is a peak into the dark and rich crevasses of his mind.And what a brilliant mind it is. It's well structured with lots of pictures. The Hellboy section alone is worth the price of admission.<br />Buy it now!
B00CL50LEC|3.0|Sorry I found this movie to be at best moderately funny in a very few spots and drawn out and boring in the rest. It's one of those movies where all the jokes that you saw in the trailer that made you want to see the movie were the only jokes in the movie. I really wanted to like this but all I could think was how much money I just wasted. In the trailer you see the zombie teaching the girl how to act like a zombie so as not to draw attention which I thought was hilarious but that was it. I was expecting them to expand on that in the movie but they just dropped it then and there one scene only and moved on. If the story had been fleshed out a lot more it would have been a very funny movie. All I can say is Meh......
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I WANT TO PASS 202. I am stuck but I will pass it eventually. I hate the chocolate that spreads. I also hate the bombs. Orders that you collect are cool.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham wrote a gem. Great story line, with believable characters and excellent slow building drama. I read<br />A Time to Kill and this is a superb sequel
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|awesome they get better every album. Michaels vocals ,tims bass Ozs Guitar , Roberts drumming. they could not have done it any better. Killer album . i have not stopped playing it
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|great movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is challenging but simple and it definately makes you think. When you have no lives left you can't wait tor more so you can complete the level that is challenging you. Even if you don't like challenges you will still like this game!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Reading now and almost done.  I love this authors work!  This book is wonderful only I wish it didn't jump back and forth with each character.  I prefer a nice flowing story.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Fantastic adaptation that really rings true for the modern era. Whedon wisely updates the B&B relationship in a way that makes sense (no spoilers). Perfect comic timing and pathos. A great find for Shakespeare fans. Although some don't like the black and white, given what was reportedly spent for the micro-budget, the movie looks surprisingly lush.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It drives me crazy but I love it. Gives my brain a workout even when I get stuck on a level.
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|Well written. Like he autobiographic style and it sea to be written from an honest place! Would recommend to working women of all ages
B00ETHPJ1U|5.0|For those who already know of these, I will be brief about the general quality. The music itself is one of the great treasures of western music. The live peformances and conducting give some of the most vivid renderings of these works. Of course others are good as well, but I've found I prefer Gardiner's recordings over all the others. For example, BWV 88 &#34;Siehe, ich will viel Fischer aussenden&#34;. After hearing Suzuki, Harnoncourt, Koopman, Richter, and even Herreweghe, Gardiner is the only one who nails the excitement and exuberance of the &#34;hunt&#34; metaphor after the peaceful lull of the &#34;fishing&#34; metaphor. Now imagine moments like this happening thousands of times.  At least for me (one who is easily swept up in Bach's music even in a midi file), this set is completely deserving of all the praise its received, even amongst other great recordings.<br /><br />This is 5 stars for people who don't own a large number of the individual albums. Look elsewhere to see the individual double albums if you don't know what I'm talking about. You can save maybe 600-800 dollars buying this instead of the 28 individual releases. It is a bargin deal, not the high-end collector's deal. You would get a lower rating if you compared the previous packaging to this. But I think that is a mistake in rating, since what I'm concerned about is the music you get for the price for this item, not packaging for some other items. For a box set at a substatially lower price, I was actually satisfied with the way they kept the original photography and simplified sleeves.<br /><br />That being said, if you are really a materialist and care for the packaging of the originals, then go ahead collecting each one and skip over this. Having the notes all printed out with a picture on each double album, with the nice texture and thickness, makes them feel like little books. For this box set, all of the text from Gardiner's notes, the cantata translations, and the musician's interview are on a single CDROM, not with the cd at all, so you won't have that tactile experience that Apple also does with their packaging.<br /><br />This set has just individual sleeves for each of the 56 items, so obviously the numbering and images for the volumes don't correspond to the older, individual releases. That might throw you off if you have built up mental associations from the individual releases like &#34;oh the girl in blue on volume 2 has my favorite soprano aria&#34;. If it was on disc one, then you are in luck as they will still match, but if disc 2, now its a different image.<br /><br />Do act fast, as there is a limited number and some retailers I've talked to said they have sold out.are on a single CDROM, not with the cd at all, so you won't have that tactile experience that Apple also does with their packaging.<br /><br />This set has just individual sleeves for each of the 56 items, so obviously the numbering and images for the volumes don't correspond to the older, individual releases.

006202406X|1.0|This last book made me wish I'd never read the first two and got involved with all the characters. Roth has made a big mistake with this ending and made many of her fans and readers upset and depressed. I love re-reading book series but after this ending, I'm inclined to never pick up the divergent series again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would!  This entire trilogy was fantastic!  I wish they would come out with a continuation to the store.  It was just that good.  I hope the movie version is as good, but I don't think it will be!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!! Addictive!! Would like options for more lives! Should be, reach certain levels for lives or specials! So happy is on kindle!
B00EW79Y0O|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie since it came out and I saw it in the theater.  Dennis Quaid, Jackie Earle Haley, Dennis Christopher (who never got the acclaim that he deserved), and Daniel Stern all did a great job in bringing to life the feelings of stifled dreams and lost hope that can accompany growing up in a small, midwestern industrial town.  The cultural war between the college students and the &#34;cutters&#34; is a familiar story of us vs. them and it is presented in an emotionally honest format.<br /><br />Paul Dooley as the anachronistic father is hilarious and Barbara Barrie as the cooly constant mother play their supporting roles very well to Dennis Christopher's star turn as the physically gifted bike racer who is obsessed with Italian racing stars.  It is interesting to see how well he is accepted by his friends (Quaid, Haley and Stern) who have no understanding of his love of bikes, but are bound to him with their common childhood friendship.  All of the characters could have come off as flat, two-dimensional caricatures, but everyone presents their parts as fully developed characters.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my three oldest boys and the movie showed them good values, morals and still allowed them to laugh at some silly behavior.  There are some very great lines in the movie and the entire family can sit down together without fear of inappropriate language, or anything that may require a quick explanation of human sexuality.  This is a forgotten gem of a movie.
B001HN6922|5.0|Great movie - disc was in perfect shape. cars 2 is a good follow up to the original movie. Good deal.
B00DQQSD2W|1.0|My rating has nothing to do with the book itself, as it's fantastic. However, the Amazon Kindle version I downloaded has low resolution source images which is not what I purchased the book for. It may only be the Kindle PC viewer version that suffers this, so be warned however I expect any Kindle version will suffer. The audio and video does not work for me. Additionally, the Kindle PC viewer also has no zoom feature like you get with Adobe's pdf viewer or Chrome's built in viewer. Seriously Amazon, get with it.<br /><br />Images on the IPAD (or Mac) Ibook versions have a much higher image resolution if that's your thing. Don't expect a 'enhanced' experience otherwise, unless Amazon plans to offer<br />Kindle pc users a similar experience with an update to the reader and the image source content of the ebook.<br /><br />Not here to bash, just super disappointed. Interested to hear from anyone who can directly compare the Kindle version to the Ibooks, as it seems these editions are really intended for the Retina display of the Ipad and/or a Mac.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|There are definite pros as well as cons with this mouse. Here's what I found good and bad personally.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plenty of additional buttons and placed in easy to reach areas. Fully customizable buttons.<br /><br />On the fly macro function, which allows you to customize a button to do a combination of keys/buttons. I found this very useful in certain games.<br /><br />Nice ergonomics. This was a very important factor for me when i was shopping for my next mouse and the primary reason I bought this mouse. I have a finger grip style and I found this easy to hold, could be a little bigger but I can see this fitting most people well.<br /><br />Good laser sensor. Many current high end gaming mice use the same sensor.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Extremely soft Left and Right mouse buttons. I had to return the first one I received because the right mouse was so soft that when you click down, it does not always click back up. The next one I received was slightly better.<br /><br />Build quality feels cheap. If you ever owned a Logitech you can immediately feel and notice a difference in quality. This would not be an issue if the mouse was cheaper, say 20-30 dollars (i believe the original price was around that). But for 40, it should be a little better.<br /><br />Unsmooth mouse feet. For me, right when I opened the package and looked underneath the mouse, the mouse feet were already coming loose. I had to push them back down and stick flat. Which wasn't a biggy. The main issue was that only a small portion of the back mouse foot contacted the mouse pad. This lead to jerkiness when compared to my other mouse. I sanded it smooth and it made a huge difference. But what I additionally found out is that the cover for the additional weight compartment sticks out at one edge past the flush with the rest of the bottom of the mouse and was touching the mouse pad as well. I sanded that down as well.<br /><br />After getting all the kinks out of the way, I do think themouse performs well. If they improve the build quality slightly and address the issues stated, this mouse would be amazing, easily worth 40-60 dollars. I would rate this mouse 3.5 stars as it is. Also just to let you know the mice i've previously used were: Logitech G9, G7, MS Sidewinder. Hope this helps.<br /><br />update: had excellent customer service experience. They noted my concerns and offered refund if I wanted. So I upped rating to 4 stars.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to record my notes in all meetings, email them and create reminders of important due dates awesome tool
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I should have waited a few days before buying any apps for my Kindle that were suggested by Amazon. Most have been impossible to use or not very functional.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved how all the characters connected and the twist, turns and the unexpected events. Liane Moriarty's creativity is amazing!  Highly recommended!!!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I got this for my grand kids & they really like playing this one.  Of course my kindle & iphone are filling up with more games for them!!
1118156315|5.0|This book is an inspiring useful and fun collection of information related to personal branding but in an effective way.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is definitely in my top 5 favorite series! The characters in this book draws you in and the characters feel so real to you. I will read anything Cassandra Claire writes because out of all of the books she has released, I haven't been disappointed yet.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was easy reading and very interesting.  I did not know that an orphan train existed.  Liked the back and forth in timeline.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|An amazing version of a fantastic story. Joss Whedon and Friends make Shakespeare look easy and fun. Definitely one of the best versions.
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|This is a pretty fun flick. It has lots of action and a decent story. I can watch it many times.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It can be addictive. If you like puzzle games, I would definitely recommend it. And you can't beat the price.
B0026NZR98|4.0|This was an interesting movie. It was not quite a thrill a minute. It's not one I would watch over and over but it was qorth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun for all ages. My children played all the time then they got stuck  and asked for my help. Now I'm hooked
B00A285OOW|5.0|Sad love story strife between English.  Great history leading up to henry book gave insight to why he was the type of man due to father and grandmother
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|was not what I expected after seeing him in the Jimmy Fallon show....they said music from show on this CD
B007PVHANM|5.0|Watch it over and over.  It is amazing.  The music is great, the interviews and the documentary itself.  I learned a lot.  I lend it out often/
1616550414|5.0|I love zelda and now I can have a great book of artwork to cheer up my day. Zelda rules!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am completely addicted to this show! I find it sort of new and different from anything else out there. I like the character development and interaction and feel as thought I actually KNOW some of the characters ( I want to get in there and slap a few of them around at times....)<br />Completely entertaining and I get lost in it when I watch which is the point (to me) of a good show.
B003N1I3SO|5.0|J'aime le CD. Stromae est une du meilleur. I love the cd. Stromae is one of the best. Tu veux plus?
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This cd in one word is: Incredible!<br />The songs are all top notch, no filler. The dual guitars, melodic vocals, and thundering back beat are what you remember from Stryper's \\"Glory Days\\", only better!<br />This is one of their best releases , and if you are a fan of this type of music, you won't be disappointed!<br />I don't write many reviews, but this release is worthy of a 5 star rating!!<br />Crank it up and rip the knob off!!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I loved the movie so much. With the digital copy I can put in on my iPods and more. Yata!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Can't get enough Castle. So bummed that the season ended and I have to wait for the next season to come out and find out Beckett's answer.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I absolutly love this movie and It arrived literally overnight, the only complaint is that one of the hinges was broken but not worth the trouble to return.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Traditional &#34;Spark-like&#34; patterns of twisting emotions are evident in this book. You end with a wholesome feeling that everyone was going to be ok, and everyone made the right choices. Love eventually wins, but not in the usual manner.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I love it! Baz hasn't worked with Leonardo since R&J but I think their Alexander could have been wonderful. Gorgeous.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show!  Compelling characters and story despite having no sex and little violence.  The set design and costumes are gorgeous.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I waited to write a review until I'd had the CD a while and listened to it at least 15 times.<br /><br />Short version:  This CD strikes a perfect balance between beautiful music and incredible musicianship.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of DT since 1992.  Highs for me have been Images and Words, Awake, Scenes from a Memory, Train of Thought, A Dramatic Turn of Events, and now the self-titled &#34;Dream Theater,&#34; which I'd rank as one of their 3 best CDs (with I&W and SFAM).<br /><br />The musicianship, as always, is absolute top-shelf.  They do seem to &#34;show off&#34; slightly less than normal, which is neither a good nor bad thing…just an observation.<br /><br />The audio quality, as some have noted, isn't as good as it should be.  Like most CDs, it's mastered way too loud, but this doesn't detract much, if at all from my enjoyment of the music.<br /><br />Mike Mangini puts in a great performance, and I'm glad he (and the band) resisted the temptation for him to overplay on the disc (his first as a full contributor).  He's impressive throughout, but very tasteful.  Much as I loved Portnoy's drumming, I can't honestly say I missed his presence.<br /><br />In fact, as with the previous disc, I'm THRILLED that there was no rap or death growls on this disc.  A couple of songs on previous DT albums were ruined for me (Nightmare to Remember, Dark Eternal Night, etc) by poorly-placed and unnecessary growls, etc that simply didn't fit.  Portnoy obviously likes those styles, but they don't fit in DT's music at all.  Pain of Salvation blends those styles into their brand of progmetal quite well, if you're into that (check out &#34;The Perfect Element, Pt. 1&#34; or &#34;Remedy Lane&#34;), though they do it sparingly (which is good, since I'm not a rap/growl fan).<br /><br />The big stories on this disc (for me) are the songwriting and Labrie's vocals.  This might actually be his best ever vocals, to my ears.  Truly exceptional, especially on The Bigger Picture (gorgeous!!) and Illumination Theory (awesome power and emotion, especially after the middle orchestra break).<br /><br />The songwriting is an absolute delight and shows that DT aren't just masters of their instruments, but also of songwriting.  Highlights for me include &#34;The Bigger Picture&#34; (incredible headphone song with lights off/eyes closed), and Illumination Theory, The Enemy Inside, and Behind the Veil, though every song truly is fantastic.rgeous!!) and Illumination Theory (awesome power and emotion, especially after the middle orchestra break).<br /><br />The songwriting is an absolute delight and shows that DT aren't just masters of their instruments, but also of songwriting.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is an intriguing story of a pilgrimage toward self-awareness for more than one character, as well as a story of spiritual rebirth and hope.  Sometimes  the episodic nature of the story leads the reader to want to hear the next episode; sometimes it makes the reader want to be done with the story.  Perhaps that is partly intentional, since Harold Fry wishes he were done with his seemingly never-ending pilgrimage, too.  The book touches on many themes that are worthy of deep thought and that can provoke good book club discussion, but it seldom ventures deeper than a topical presentation of those themes.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is a very good book. I am disappointed that I waited 20 years to read it. Read it now.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Three great games in one can't beat that journey is the stand out of the three and flower and flow are just as enjoyable
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Full disclosure - I have been a fan of Stryper from the very beginning (1983ish?).  However, I am not easily impressed just because I am a longtime fan.  With that being said, this album ROCKS!!!!  As others have said...great production, HEAVY songs, great musicianship...simply an awesome collection of songs and I must agree that it might be their best album!!!!!  The physical CD/DVD are awesome quality!!!  I can't wait to see them live, for at least the 8th time, and hear these songs live!!!  OH, and lastly, it is nice to hear the bass guitar.  :D
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a great way to relax! I totally love this game! This game makes me a happy camper!
B005RDF2RG|5.0|We loved this Shrek movie.<br />It is very cute and funny.<br />I love the characters.<br />Recommend it.<br />Great Family Fun.
B0033AGPG2|5.0|I'm a huge Hendrix fan, so perhaps this review is a little biased.  The songs are great.  Just wanted to let vinyl fans know that the jacket, included booklet, and the vinyl itself are absolutely wonderful.  Sounds amazing on my turntable setup.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|The controls are kinda clunky but could be worse. I do like the upgrades but I wish the paint system was a little more well rounded.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Received this album on vinyl as a gift, and I must say it exceeded all of my expectations.  The album itself is stellar, and the vinyl print is great.  Love it.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|Most of the tracks are standard KJ \\"Standards\\"..... not that that's bad.<br />But the album is worth the price for the \\"Somewhere\\" title track alone, in which the trio<br />starts off playing the lovely Leonard Bernstein / Stephen Sondheim composition and then<br />seamlessly segues into a terrific KJ original \\"Everywhere\\".
B0002O06NA|4.0|Not the best Black Keys album...but good.  The vinyl is top notch.  Sounds great on my turntable setup.  No complaints.
B0083H6AQA|2.0|It's not the greatest Robert Pattinson movie but was entertaining. Was a bit disappointed because I really wanted to see this movie .
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is easy to set up, and the quality of the picture streaming from my Nexus 5 is absolutely unbelievable - better than streaming from my PC with an HDMI cable.  Once more apps start to support it - Watch ESPN, NHL / NFL / NBA apps, etc - it will be bar none the best $35 you can spend for entertainment.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Was a great game was at level 40 odd, then put it on today and it has taken me right back to the beginning. Not impressed.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Bought this on a whim and I absolutely love it.  Great vocals.  I am typically skeptical of albums pressed on colored vinyl, but this sounds amazing.  Love it.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Who could resist a movie with a title like Cowboys and Aliens?  It sounds like the contents of a toy chest.  But unfortunately, the joke stops there.  While this film had plenty of room for wit, irony or satire, the cleverness never seems to go past the title, and it ends up serving all the hackneyed cliches of both western and alien attack genres straight up.  The pace sags.  You could go out for popcorn and not miss much of anything.  The lead character is a very cool cowboy, but Harrison Ford steals the show as a crusty old cattle baron, delivering acting quality more deserving of King Lear.  Other characters were appealing, but I found myself most worried about the dog.  The special effects and the aliens seemed like nothing new......the alien genre may even be more played out right now than westerns.  (An exception would be District Nine, which turns the alien genre right on it's head.)<br /><br />Cowboys and Aliens isn't terrible.  It's just not that great.  I'd recommend watching this movie, but with lower expectations than the title suggests.
B008O037RG|5.0|Great album, wonderful vinyl pressing.  If you're a fan of Mumford and Sons, pick this up.  You'll love it, guaranteed.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan manages to cut through the mythology surrounding Jesus in a respectful manner, offering us his interpretation of the milieu in which this particular Jewish &#34;messiah&#34; lived. (Yes, there were others.) What I found particularly interesting (and, I admit, this confirmed my own beliefs) was the discussion of the formation of the early Church and the divisiveness between those who wanted &#34;Christianity&#34; to be a part of the Jewish faith (Jesus' own brother and other followers) and those who chose to spread the Gospel to the &#34;pagans&#34; throughout the Roman Empire (particularly Paul).
B005QYKD4I|5.0|amazing movie with a crazy kick at the end of tye movie. can't wait for the fourth movie to come out!!  It will be the best
B008XBHIEY|5.0|This is more than just a story about man against nature. Sherif Brody must redeem himself after being swayed by those more concerned with money than safety. Out of his element he goes from &#34;Everyman&#34; to hero, perhaps not by choice but because he has to.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game!  I wish it was much easier to gain gems though.  The campaign is also an excellent idea.  It has a lot of stages.
B0045JEPXU|4.0|Very good album from a very good artist.  This is a good dance CD that Pitbull fans will like to help get their party started
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My boys love the movie and we enjoyed it for family night.  Popcorn and cuddle time woth a great movie
B000W1AOHG|5.0|Love this song I have it on my phone now I use it for decompressing when I over the edge
B0067R0APK|2.0|Current version is slow to update all the panels as to be useless. Sometimes taking more than 5 minutes before loading and the busy indicator going away.
B000W1W9EW|5.0|Love this song I have it on my phone now I use it for decompressing when I over the edge
B00136NWLE|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite songs. When Billy Joel sings about playing in a small club, he makes you feel like you're right there. Good music, enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful, addicting page-turner. It had a great plot and well developed characters. It never got too complicated or confusing. The pacing was also extremely well done. I never found myself getting even a tad bit bored. Usually I can pretty well anticipate the ending/plot twists of books such as this just because I've read so many books in this sort of genre, but this one definitely surprised me multiple times. Would very highly recommend. Also, one can never beat the instantaneous satisfaction of seeing this book on Amazon and getting to read it like 30 seconds later. Love the one-click settings and super quick download on the Kindle app on my iPad.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|Great movie!  Blu-Ray is the best way to see it!  Looks great, sounds great, still a great movie.  The best!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|The songs always get stuck in my head. I can listen to this album over and over again and not ever get sick of it!
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Matrix NO, good Si-Fi action with interesting plot, YES. Christian Bale is excellent and believable in his role. I enjoyed the transition from enforcing Cleric to gaining human emotion. The journey is certainly interesting and worth watching.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was confused most of the time I was reading this. Couldn't keep up with the plot and all the characters. Maybe that's my own fault, but usually I don't have problems with this. And even though it sucks, I understand why the ending is the way it is (same with Mockingjay). However, I personally hate unhappy endings to books and therefore just couldn't bring myself to say I really liked the book overall. To each his own.
B009BWGQRE|5.0|North Face is a very powerful film. A true story about the assault in 1936 of what was called, “the last remaining  mountain in the Alps who;s summit had never been concurred”.<br /><br />I was absolutely convinced that Toni Kurz along with his partner Andi Hinterstoisser where claiming the Eiger. This simply means the photography is truly overwhelming fantastic. The film a is bone chilling in its drama, the story line is realistic in it's truth along with keeping me captivated throughout.<br /><br />If you worry about subtitles, remember it’s very easy to go back 10 seconds with Amazon to better understand the language.<br /><br />This film kept my interest every step of the way and I strongly recommend it’s viewing.
0061673730|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Bought it recently because our copy got lost. The Amazon price was very good. We're glad we got it because it was worth another read.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I watched it a few weeks ago and cant even remember most of it, the plot was very thin and could have been much better if they didn't try to focus on the &#34;star&#34;.
B007RI56NY|4.0|Train puts out some good &#34;I don't have to pay attention to this&#34; music, and this album is no exception.  I got it on special for free, so I definitely have nothing to complain about. It's not going to be on my &#34;Top 10 Albums Ever&#34; list, but it's not bad.
B00CISAPJS|4.0|It was a fun show to watch, the good guys win and get the girl, and the bad guys get whats comming to them. Its a nice move with out ever getting nasty.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Who you gonna call?  The Keymaster and the Gatekeeper!  And you gotta love Gozer the Gozarian... A classic of '80's cinema!
B0051XQI84|5.0|Great entertainment for everyone, no vulgarity and good wholesome family movie. Its nice to see something that's just simple and fun.
B001KO3FFW|4.0|This was another freebie, and it was pretty good.  Again, not going to be on my desert island list, but it's not too shabby.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Fun, action/adventure movie. I really enjoyed the plot and characters. Nice to see Pitt in an actual action picture. Great special effects and zombie theme for zombie fans!
B003L16FAE|5.0|This was sort of the pre-Expendables Expendables - Scharzenegger, Weathers, Savage; plus awesome weapons and ridiculous fights.  You have to love it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It's an exciting story of love and sex. I am anxious to read the third book and find out how these young lovers work out their issues. The tension builds with each story and you don't want the story to end.
B003F48E4W|4.0|This is Keifer Sutherland at his crazy-vampire best!  And it's pretty tough to go wrong with the team of Haim and Feldman.  It would actually be even more amazing if there was more Frog Brother & Haim action. It's not the best vampire movie ever, but it's pretty fun.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|Awesome sweet comedy for the ages! A lovely book to cherish always. A rite of passage and social observations every girl should read and share. Perfect for a teen girl book club.
B0008JIJ2E|4.0|Wax on, wax off.  I'm not sure why there's a plethora of remakes these days, when the originals are so much better.  So pick up your copy and get ready to sweep the leg!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book kept me wanting to read more after each chapter. I felt like I was actually part of story.
B00AEFXZJE|4.0|Everyone knows that everything's better with some Bacon! I didn't watch the remake, 'cause really, who needs the remake with such a classic original?  It's like re-making Citizen Kane.  You could, but why would you?
0307352153|4.0|This is a must read for all teachers, CEOs, pastors, etc. (And it wouldn't hurt for all the spouses of introverts either!) Very validating to have my personality and needs backed up by thoughtful research and an intelligent writer. I appreciate that she was not saying introverts are superior, but that we need introverts' voices in this very loud world.
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|Not long after Tom Hanks managed to find an apartment that didn't require him to dress as a woman and split rent with a similarly trans Peter Scolari, he found a magic fortune-telling booth and got body-swapped with a little kid.  It's weird that the movie follows the kid-in-Tom's body around - I'm curious about how Tom managed to get by as a child for several weeks. (Do I smell a sequel?)<br /><br />Alright, this was a fun movie, despite the slightly disturbing subtext (the female lead is basically a pedophile,isn't she?).  Just don't think about it too much; kick back and enjoy a fun bit of giant-keyboard dancing.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Creativity. Surprises. These were the elements I felt were missing from Encore through Recovery. Eminem is brilliant with words - and it shows on every one of his albums. But there is a magic about SSLP, MMLP, and The Eminem Show - the production on each of those is immaculate. It grabs you and takes you for a ride. MMLP2 recaptures that magic for a whole hour and 20 minutes.<br /><br />Eminem said in a recent interview that he didn't get into the production on Recovery, but was really into it, along with Rick Rubin, on MMLP2. It shows. The album is all over the place, from sampling Time Of The Season by The Zombies (Rhyme or Reason) to revisiting old skits (Parking Lot), from rapping 101 words in 16 seconds (Rap God) to having Nate Ruess from Fun sing one of Em's most emotional songs. It's all over the place...yet it's cohesive, it flows so well together. It's actually unbelievable how many styles are incorporated into this album.<br /><br />Standouts: Legacy, Rap God, Stronger Than I Was, Headlights, Beautiful Pain (bonus track).<br /><br />This album is worth every penny. You'll like some songs better than others, but you'll find it hard to skip any track.<br /><br />5/5
B001TH16DI|5.0|I am more of a Wars than a Trek fella, but this box set is awesome!  I hadn't seen most of these movies since I was a young 'un, but man, did this bring back some memories!  These movies are terrible, and yet, wonderful.  Wrath of Khan holds up surprisingly well - not the effects (look out for the puppet-brain-worms!), but the storyline is nicely put together.  And I totally didn't remember that the fanfare for the first movie later became the theme for Next Generation.  All in all, this set was totally worth it for the nostalgia rush.
B0070XB0N6|4.0|I wrote in my Facebook post that the buttons for eyes are what disturb me the most. After seeing the movie and now reading the book, that still holds true.<br /><br />It is a great story, although a bit creepy!
B006RXQ800|4.0|This film is SO LONG, and the final fight is incredibly brutal, but it's really an interesting look at what New York was like in the 1800's.  From what I've been able to gather, it's (relatively) historically accurate, which makes it a pretty fascinating study.  Daniel Day Lewis is an amazing actor, and he's in full-on, insane form here.
B000FA675C|4.0|Very good mystery.  Dan Brown has written a great story, although I recognize it is fiction.  It kept my interest up throughout.
1476727651|4.0|My wife and I are both huge Stephen King fans, so we were stoked to see he had a new book coming out.  The fact that it was a sequel to one of the best stories he's ever written was just a bonus.  But this is NOT &#34;The Shining&#34;; this book follows an older, more weathered character, by an older, more weathered writer.  I was intrigued that King seems to have included his son's horror world as part of his own (or possibly vice-versa).  It's not the best King story I've ever read, but it's still King, and it's pretty good.  Definitely an entertaining read. And it makes me wonder if there's going to be some Stephen King/Joe Hill cross-over works coming, which would probably be a wonderful thing.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Fantastic insight to a great company. Highly recommend it. Wish I had the vision that Jeff Bezos has. Will try to apply this vision to my company.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I'm a bit of a lounge-Sinatra fan, and this album is some good '60's crooning.  Gotta love the combo of Basie and Sinatra and Vegas!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to candy crush & I am thrilled it is on my Kindle.  Thank you very much  Amazon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. I want portals and more items like more spawn eggs. also get pocket inventory editor. get this game. I shall always love it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great reading.  Makes you want to keep turning the pages even though you know you need to get some sleep.
1449410243|5.0|Got this for my neighbor since she has 3 cats.  It is funny and very witty, I liked it, too.
B003YL4L0W|3.0|This book tended to drag on too much with a lot of unnecessary information that is not really pertinent to telling the story. Feels like Jodi Picoult is just writing to fill her usual 400+ pages.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|This was a good movie and a little of &#34;Carrie&#34; in it.  Some parts will startle you into jumping., but not that scary.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a writer, it's been at least a few years since I read a book that made me forget I was reading! Most books, I'm preoccupied with how the author did this or that, his/her writing style, and how the story is just okay, not wonderful, but pretty good. With this book, I kept trying to pin down how John Green wrote the way he did -- how did he describe things so well? how did he write such great dialogue? -- but every time I failed because I was so drawn into the story that I'd forget I was supposed to be analyzing his style. I love having this problem! The story is sad, funny, engaging, romantic (but not in a sappy way), and poignant all at the same time. I loved the characters, even the minor ones like Patrick the social worker in the &#34;Literal Heart of Jesus Church&#34;! This book is supposed to be for young adults, but I'm an adult and I loved it! I would recommend it for anyone of any age who reads to get insights into life and who likes great dialogue. Perfect!!
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This is the first movie we took our 3 year old to see at the movies. She loved this movie and I think I love it just as much..... Three words I have to say dun dun dun....I want a &#34;BELT&#34;..
1573229725|5.0|This novel has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster! Fast-paced, extremely well written, unique characters, crazy plotline, smashing ending....what more could you want in a story? As in the other novels I've read by Waters, some of the characters are extremely unlikable, and the tone is pretty dark in places, but the great storyline makes up for it. The plot is too complicated to summarize well here, but basically the story revolves around a young pick pocket woman who pretends to be a maid to another young woman in order to con her into marrying a really horrible con artist guy named &#34;Gentleman.&#34; If you love a great Victorian story, buy this!!
160774273X|5.0|This book is amazing. The recipes are easy to follow and taste great! The breads look gorgeous every time they come out of the oven, as well!
1573228737|4.0|I loved Little Stranger, so I was slightly less amazed with Affinity. The story is fascinating -- a young woman known for her powers as a medium is imprisoned for her role in a woman's death. The main character, a &#34;lady,&#34; (rather than the commoners in the prison), volunteers to help at the prison and becomes rather obsessed with the young woman. Of course, there are lots of layers to these characters and their stories -- I am oversimplifying here -- and the ending packs a punch! Probably the best ending I've read in years!! But the dark tone got to me after a while -- the descriptions of the horrible, bleak prison and the main characters' engulfing depression really wore me down. Other readers may not feel the same way. But, overall, this was a good read and extremely well written.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It has MUCH heart!  My late husband was an alcoholic and he had anger problems when he was drinking.  I loved the story too - even though I wasn't sure I was going to when it started but in the end and all in all - I liked it.  But the relationship between Dan and Casey, Dan and Billy, Dan and John, and especially Dan and Abra were so real and full.  I liked how the real story behind the Shining came out in this book - Kubic's interpretation be danged.  Neither the Shining nor Doctor Sleep is about horror - but then most of Stephen King's books aren't.  A Great Read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|the Husbands' Secret<br />- I was first compelled by it being a best seller, and believe me you will not be disappointed.<br />I simply loved this book; it is truly a page turner.<br /> The characters were well-developed, and complex. We have Cecilia the perfect wife, and JohnPaul (the not so perfect husband).  Then we have Tess, Will and Felicity the interesting love triangle.  Then there is Rachel and Janie.  I greatly enjoyed how the lives of these characters intertwined, how their life develops by their choices and their secrets.<br />Which leads you to think about our own choices, our own secrets and the 'what if's' of life.<br />Does everybody really know everything about us... if they did how would that change us, the person we portray to be... who are we without our secrets.
B00006IX0R|5.0|I only liked two of the songs on this album but that's on me, not the CD. Unless you are a diehard cranberries fan just buy the MP3's of the songs you like.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great stress reliever and point of frustration but I find is very challenging. its like a drug you cant get enough of it and sometimes is hard to put it down, I love it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it, BUT, package seriously lacks adequate installation and operation instructions!  Had to use online information constantly to resolve issues.  Some were not resolvable, i.e., when I first researched online before my purchase, it said it would work with Google Chrome on a Vista computer.  AFTER purchase and digging down deeper on requirements and user comments I found it will only work with Windows 7 and above.  Very disappointed with that.  Now I have to use my cell phone and again, with little instruction - not easy at all!
B005KELQEU|5.0|I have bought Belkin cases before and have always been happy with them.  Same with this one, and the price is reasonable.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I have hair like Natasha Lyonne, 2c/3a curls. I can see how a lot of these tips work for other people, especially very curly hair. I have frizzy, upon frizzy, upon frizzy, wavy/swavy sometimes curly hair with seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis (weird oily/dry scalp).     Edit: I'm changing my review from a 4 to a 5. To those who feel discouraged, there is hope! Since the first time I reviewed the book I cut about 10 inches of my hair off. It rests at my shoulders now, and is a lot easier to experiment with since there is so much less of it. As of May 2015, no heating tools have touched my head, and it has worked out very nicely! It is almost the end of the summer and I have not cursed the humidity once.   I'm still using a sulfate-free shampoo (AG Fast Food Shampoo), and I switch between Tresemme Un(done) conditioner (silicone and glycerin free) and Yes to Carrots conditioner. I use a leave-in conditioner and Ouidad Climate Control Gel (alcohol free). Navigating the curly hair products has been a lot easier after reading this book, and I think its a good resource for anyone who wants better curls.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I like the story it was totally unexpected......and how the story was getting more and more tangling that you need to finish right the way
B00ESY77LO|3.0|This version of the movie was way below the class level of the original version. The only thing going for this version was some special effects that were not possible back in the day. I recommend the original version.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I had three Akita dogs and loved them.  It was a good story and I loved it.<br />They are people dogs. I loved them so much. You couldn't have a more loving dog.

B00506NRBS|4.0|I learned a lot from this simple book . It is uplifting ,good guide for business starters . It is sad that most businesses do not operate the same unique way any more.  The title should be how to be happy living honestly and simply .

0446401307|5.0|What can I say.  I'm addicted to Michael Connelly Harry Bosch detective stories.  He's the master of detective novels.  Hopefully, Connelly will keep pumping out stories and live to a ripe old age.
B000816TCY|5.0|Arrived quickly, Brand new in box, in tight sealed vacuumed envelope.Nikon products work best and last the longest in Nikon cameras. Would buy again from this seller...Good Deal!
B00594XOZU|2.0|The app was not at all compatible with my kindle-fire e-reader. The app is generally a wonderful app for other devices such as Apple, Android, etc, although the technical difficulties caused me personally to side to using the app mainly on my Apple product. The fact it was not at all compatible and refused to load in any situation caused little use to it on the kindle device.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Quick and easy read. I loved the series when I was in junior high school. I read about 7 of them. So I decided to re-read the first one to see how I would like it. The stories were always interesting to me, but I read 500-1000 page books now so this was a breeze<br /> I would recommend this to kids in elementary school, and even junior high school.
1401938906|5.0|Pam Grout did an astounding job of making what many people consider a complex subject into a friendly, enlightening and humorous read.  She allowed us to see the &#34;friendly&#34; side of energy.  Most are so afraid to even discuss their potential as it relates to energy, but Pam succeeded in helping us to see energy and the way we interact with it on familiar terms.  I have already given this book to my son to read, and he is posting great things on Facebook about it!  I know it will be a NY Times best seller!
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|I was surprised at how much I liked the first Silent Hill movie, so I hoped I would like this one just as much. But alas, that ended up not happening. I did not enjoy Silent Hill: Revelation much at all. There were some things that conflicted with the events of the first film, and the dialogue in this one was so awful in so many places I literally cringed. The story was confusing (partially because some things conflicted with the events of the first film, as previously stated) and not paced well at all, there were also some things they brought in early on that seemed like they'd play a role that really ended up not being used at all. There were a couple of suspenseful parts, though, but they only lasted for a few short moments, and Sean Bean and Adelaide Clemens did well in their roles despite the awful dialogue. But overall, Silent Hill: Revelation is just not a good movie, it did a lousy job of following up the first movie. I wouldn't recommend it.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|one of my all time favorite movie! I love it, it's so cheesy and funny!!<br />I like the story, the characters... Etc.!!<br />Just an amazing movie!!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Very good cd. I like all the songs not just one! Has a good message. I bought it for my son.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I absolutely love Feedly. I've been using it since Google Reader shut down. I'm a daily user of RSS and Feedly is definitely leading the way when it comes to feed readers. Now that they allow importing of OPML files, the service is even better and easy to migrate to if you're already using another feed reader.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it and know a lot of people who have it. It is very additive  but also very challenging.
6305949980|5.0|Oooh how I have missed this movie!!! Grew up on this with VHS (yes that old large cassette tape you stuck in a VCR that was attached to your TV) and I wanted it on DVD when our new TV wouldn't hook up right to the VCR. I finally got it and I love it just as much if not MORE than when I first watched it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|i just love it. And I tell everyone about so they can get it also. I think it is a great pass time.
0060920084|4.0|I read the reviews before I actually read the book.  The reviewers who claim that the author comes across as a angry, hateful jerk could not be further from the truth.  While there is the occasional put down of a overweight tourist here and there, the book is laugh out loud funny.  What ever happened to peoples sense of humor?  Come on people, the man is funny and some of his observations are spot on as he exposes some of the absurdities of american small town life.
B006OMM8RG|4.0|my 4 year old grandson loved it. He has been collecting some and I try to find for him what he doesn't have.
B0070YDOT8|4.0|A fun way to meet others with my passion for slot machines and blackjack. I'd like to see more slot machines but the ones that are part of the game are a lot of fun. The chips that I purchase are great buys during &#34;Happy Hour&#34;.

B004A8ZWWE|1.0|I am buying most of my DVDs/Blurays with a digital copy.  This allows me to watch them anywhere.  I like the flexibility of keeping my movie library online.  So if I am at home or on the road they are all immediately accessible.  When I purchased Real Steel with &#34;Digital Copy&#34; I assumed it would be the Ultraviolet digital copy and that I could add it to my library.  Was I ever wrong!!  This &#34;digital copy&#34; comes on a disc that you can add to one (count 'em....only one) device.  You cannot add it to your library.  You cannot access it from anywhere.  If you want to watch it on the road, you must first remember to transfer it to the device you will be taking with you.  And I paid extra for this!  What a waste.  Next time I will be more careful when purchasing digital copies of my movies and make sure it is one that can be added to my library.  I've not seen this movie yet, but I am sort of hoping that I hate it so that I won't be tempted to buy yet another digital copy for my library.
B00F1BFRA6|2.0|I'm not rating Downton Abbey Season 4 as much as the 50 people who gushed ratings for a program not yet seen.  Are you kidding me..... Blah blah blah it's the best... can't wait until it comes out blah blah......  Here's an idea- wait until you actually see the program before you rate it.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|I saw the documentary about this concert in the theater before the album was released, and it was both fascinating and a bit frustrating -- it was great to see the band work the numbers that were shown -- especially \\"Dark Star,\\" at 30+ minutes -- but you realized that we were missing a lot.  The Godchauxes, for example, hardly get a look, until we see Donna Jean at the end, and there's a lot of general footage of naked people in the hot sun, which gets a bit tedious, though it is amazing that the band plays so well in tough conditions.  On the other hand, the backstory of the concert was well set up, and it was touching to see these old pranksters.  The CD's of the concert contextualize the film nicely, and we can hear that the band was in great form throughout.  \\"Dark Star\\" is a highlight, but the vocal standards are splendid too -- \\"Bird Song\\" and \\"Sing me back home\\" get lovely workouts, \\"Promised Land\\" as great energy, and \\"Deal\\" and \\"El Paso\\" go over well.  The film showed a good bit of Phil Lesh, working hard, and so I listened for his line especially on the CDs and was rewarded.  This concert followed closely on their 1972 European Tour.  They were good there, and they're good in Veneta, Oregon.  Highly recommended.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I found this game to be a good practice for patience and persistence.  It is fairly realistic but a bit too graphic to share with my grandkids.
B00BATG18K|1.0|I have been an Amy Tan fan since her first book. That being said, I couldn't finish this book because I didn't care about any of the characters enough to want to know how they ended up.  The book is well written, of course, but the themes &#34;men are beasts&#34; &#34;mothers don't love their children&#34; and &#34;how to raise and train a courtesan&#34; are not of interest to me.

B002UYEP0A|5.0|Every minute of the Animatrix is amazing. The stories, the animation, the music just amazing. I don't often get excited because of movies or tv shows, but I remember when this came out it blew me away. This is one of the only Blu-rays I own, it's one of the only collections worth my money. I don't see how people can not like this. People are so touchy and spoiled these days they wouldn't know what good was if it hit em upside the head.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Works pretty much the same way as the android app for my phone.  When it prompts for an update (often lately) the link takes me to the Google play store instead of Amazon.  What's up with that?  Updates through Amazon are few and far between.
0385349947|5.0|This book has encouraged and empowered me.<br />I knew the how-to's of being assertive and going after my goals but still felt very uncomfortable leaning in, sitting at the table, and speaking up. Sheryl's words helped me lose the complex about it, jump in and take some chances at work. And it has paid off! :-)<br /><br />I received a promotion after a few years of really giving it my all on the job and one day a colleague pulled me aside and said &#34;Quit apologizing and asking permission all the time - you're not a secretary anymore.&#34; It was not meant to disparage the role of secretaries but a kick in the behind for me to take it up a notch. I had been put in a new position because they already saw the value in what I could offer, so it was time to quit being so meek and give them what they were paying me for!<br />I went home that night and made myself re-read the things I had underlined and bookmarked in this book from the beginning.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I love the Percy Jackson books , they deserve to be Harry Potter's great competition , so when i heard of the film based of The first book , The Lightning Thief , I was very excited. But when i first saw it , I HATED IT for its laziness , When i saw it on DVD another time i was surprised that my reaction was different . It suffered from having some different parts from the book but it mostly followed it pretty well , Even though it had terrible effects and some dull acting , it makes up for it by staying true to the book , great action scenes , a fun plot and great characters , i give it a 68.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't think I would like it, after all I hated the movie. I was given a new perspective though and find that not only did I have difficulty putting the book down, I am eager to begin the second one. I don't do reviews as a rule but felt it was necessary for this one.

B00004W221|5.0|best sports movie of all time.  Motivational movie for those who need encouragement.  It is a little train that could movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was so excited for this book to come out, I was waiting for the ending of this story for what felt like forever. I couldn't put Divergent down and read through the second book just as quick. Honestly.... I felt so disappointed after the ending of Allegiant. That is just not how things should have ended. This book left me so depressed. Awful awful awful. I only gave it 3 stars because it was good up until the end. Just terribly disappointing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is hard to get stuff but it is a fun game<br />and I hope everyone will play it on the kindle
B003F3NEBG|5.0|The Blue Ray Disk beautifully restored the video to film like visuals.  It was our favorite video series and this version made it even better.  The BBC has all of books characters in this 2 disk rendition.  No 2 hour movie can approach the character development and such wonderful and colorful characters, just memorable.<br /><br />We must have seen the DVD a dozen times.  We have viewed this Blue Ray Disk version at least 5 times.  It blows away the DVD visually.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I'm very close to the end and have really enjoyed reading up to this point. It's very entertaining and easy to pick up<br />where you left off.  Really good read.
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|If you like Sci-fi then you'll like this. Some cool tech but not a great movie. Some good special effects also.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Great book! I just wish we had a book with Bridget Jones pregnancy, I believe it would of been pretty hilarious!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is completely addictive!  They don't call it Candy Crack for nothing!  Even people who think playing these games is stupid will eventually decide to check it out and start asking you, \\"Dude,...uh, can you send me some Candy Crush tickets?!\\"
B00F031XPS|4.0|I waited with great anticipation for this release. The previews with the unseen Miami footage<br />had me really excited to see this production. Understand, this was presented on television on the PBS American Masters Series. This is NOT a look at the sordid details of his drug use or the way he died. What we have here is a look at his life and his music....his wonderful, glorious music. In that endevour, the film succeeds quite well. Using interview segments from friends and bandmates (several who are now deceased), an interesting look at his journey and his struggles emerges. He WANTED to be the best, and as manager Chas Chandler says, \\"By hell he worked at it.\\"<br />The film explains how Jimi tried  to be BETTER each day. Comments from Paul McCartney,<br />Steve Winwood and Billy Cox are icing on the cake. The  interview segments from Fayne Pridgeon and Collete Mimram are a welcome surprise and touching addition to the film.<br />Eddie Kramer in studio showing how some of Jimi's incredible songs were constructed is amazing to see. The new Miami footage is astonishing and while some think that Experience Hendrix is holding back some, there may in fact not be anymore. Many times when the camera angle switches from Jimi<br />to the crowd, that sometimes means that the cameraman stopped shooting (yeah it happens) so filler footage is used. We do get some of that but what we do see will blow away the most jaded Hendrix fan. While the music is the main attraction here, the thoughts of Jimi's friends and fellow musicians mean a lot to the overall feature. In my view, this film makes the DVD documentary<br />\\"Jimi Hendrix/ Voodoo Child\\" which came in the \\"West Coast Seattle Boy\\" boxset obsolete.<br />(that one WAS a waste of time... I only watched it once). It is also superior to the 1973 Joe Boyd produced \\"A Film About Jimi Hendrix\\" but Hendrix completists will want that one in their library (I do).<br />I have to admit that by the end of the film I was moved at the words expressed and the music as it faded. We see a portrait of a man who really had no one to take care of him or really share his thoughts with. He took his journey alone with just his music and his musical vision to carry him through...and that's kinda sad. The viewer is left with a real feeling of what was truly lost when Jimi died.<br />The performance extras on the DVD while not up to modern standards (picture quality wise) are worth seeing and will take you back to a golden era in Rock history. While I couldn't give the film 5 stars,it is Experience Hendrix' best effort yet (film wise anyway).ds expressed and the music as it faded.

B00BEIYMIS|4.0|I never understand people that stick around even when strange things start to happen?  Either way, it's a pretty decent movie for being \\"Based on a True Story\\".  I'm not much of a believer that sort of thing, but that still didn't stop me from enjoying it.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|great story with exceptional acting, kept me guessing for the next plot development as the characters lived out the story
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I heard about this game a couple weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  I'd received 500 coins from Amazon for Kindle purchases a while back and decided to finally use some for this game.  I'd have GLADLY paid the measly $2 for it anyways!  GREAT game!  Very difficult at times.  I finished without cheating at all (although I was very tempted a couple times).  I very much look forward to the next installment.
B009NTNHJU|3.0|A lot of content, but personally I've lost interest in Ms. Minaj. Not to say she isn't talented in her own right, but a handful of songs (minus the dance tracks), are crass and I don't feel they have regular replay value, longevity.
B00935KWWO|4.0|Nice phone app to keep everything in one place.  I use it to keep facebook and twitter updates together in one spot.
B00B52F278|5.0|to an epic series!  Engaged and explosive action til the very last, very well written and acted finale! I was saddened to see it end
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|It was a good show. Loved the show, the characters, the scenes. Just loved everything about the show and everything on the Star Trek franchise
B009LDCXNY|4.0|from Purgatory and he and Sam take on the task of trying to close the gates of hell.  With appearances by Amanda Tapping of Stargate SG-1 and Sanctuary fame, this is another fast paced ride with the Winchester brothers
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had for about a week and am very pleased at how easy it was to set up and how well casting from a tab is working. I have a Roku for amazon prime, but when I saw this I thought for the price it was worth trying so that I could watch website videos on my TV. For example my husband and I like to watch live worship services from several churches, and it is hard for both of us to watch the smaller computer screen. The Chromecast works without a problem so far and I am very pleased with it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best Game Ever! Usually I play it before I go to sleep at night.  My granddaughter also loves to play the game too.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|This is one of the best books of all time. I can't believe how anyone could give this book a bad review. I couldn't put it down. FANTASTIC
B0063GORYU|5.0|just love the game.  Unfortunately I am obsessed with it and need to stay away for a while.  waste too much time
B0018QXL1K|5.0|Iconic. This was the first album I owned as a cd in the 6th grade! Timeless. Classic
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Pretty poor that to enjoy playing a game they want to hit you up .99 at a time.  Shame on you
B00F91H666|5.0|Great watch.  Enjoyed that it was not all blood and gore, although it was violent in many parts.  They kept it going nice without everyone havering to be covered in blood.  I enjoyed the characters.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Only complaint would be that the background picture is glitchy at timr but other than that it is a great product!
B00EJ9RIXA|3.0|its ok  it need to have more space like drop box has but its cool and its fast so its ok but like i said needs more room like drop box
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Like the looks and the aspect of the game but don't like having to dig out my credit cards and if I up grade my kindle I have to start over this is my 3rd time
B00E9HML1Q|3.0|I have all the pieces from the LOTR extended editions and this one is actually an insult to Weta Workshop.  If you have Gollum from The Two Towers extended edition you will know what I mean.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book.  I loved the people and the story and everything about it.  I own multiple copies, both ebook and paper copies.  I will definitely read this one multiple times.
B00EJOCAYW|4.0|It's a Christmas gift for my nephew, so I'm not sure how he will enjoy it, but he does love Minecraft and Leggos, so I'm assuming he'll love it. I didn't realize these were the really small leggos though. The box is tiny, but it says there are almost 500 pieces in there. If I had realized they were the small leggos, I would have gotten something else, but I'm sure my nephew will like it regardless.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an assigned reading for a college English class. To be honest, I was not too interested to begin with. As soon as I started, I had a hard time putting it down!  This is a great book about a horrible time; the setting and characters are so real.  It touched my heart, made me laugh and made me cry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun, I cannt stop playing,i have it on all my divices and drives me crazy, but i love it

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Its awesome I could use this alarm clock app every day it help me wake up on time an I'm always early for school / work
B00009RDGA|5.0|Brilliant and memorable classic and what a performance by Tatum O Neil , she really held nothing back and was a perfect match for her fellow actor and father Ryan O Neil, in this era of poverty and desperation the duo set about to make a living by their con jobs and bluff. the scenery and wonderful location also adds to the interest in this classic where we get a feeling of the time that America was going through where survival was the name of the game and society was really put to the test, we see the heart ache that this little girl experiences as all she wants is for her to be loved and appreciated, in this Ryan O Neal  really is the only choice to compliment her mature and feisty attitude. A memorable and worth watching over and over again film for sure.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like this game, but it is not the best one. I am still getting used to this on my Kindle Fire HD. I suppose the first one I learned with set my expectations, but it is not available on the Fire YET. I keep hoping.  This game is pretty, but the options are not that great. I don't care about a fancy background, don't like music or sounds with my games, and the layouts are fairly simple. Reshuffle might give one more pair of tiles to remove, but then you must reshuffle yet again.  It is pretty, but pretty is as pretty does. I'll keep it and look for a better game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like really the best game ever better then contra on the Nintendo, better then Madden on PlayStation, better then halo on Xbox, like better then Rickman downhill on the Kindle, lol
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I think Miss Balk was quite exceptional, one of the best. This is a fun movie to watch, for the whole family.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|love this movie. saw it when I was young and enjoyed it very much. bought it for my daughter and granddaughter. they both love it as well. would buy from them again.
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|As a on/off again fan since 1999, this is his best  since the Eminem show.  Love SS LP and MM LP1.  I'm not that into his more pop flavored songs from Encore till around Relapse, which I actually liked more than Recovery.  Relapse has a good amount of good songs for me to like it and ignore the few 'meh' songs.  Recovery and Encore are the albums I listened the least.<br /><br />So with that said I'd probably say Stronger Than I Was might be my least favorite track here and I'd replace it and  \\"Survivor\\" as with 2 of the bonus tracks (Groundhog Day & Wicked Ways) and put those tracks on the bonus disc... and leave the Ken outro from Wicked Ways in the main album, maybe after Rap God or Berzerk.  All in all, it's a really great and fun album and Eminem hasn't had this many consistently great tracks in a row on an album for a while.<br /><br />*11 months later 7.5 / 10
B000AA4JMU|5.0|my wife loves this movie that is why I bought it. I also enjoyed it. love the music. would buy from them again.

B004DLPXAO|2.0|AAARRRGGGHHH! Whatever in the world have they done to my Kindle app?!?!<br /><br />Kindle is my favorite ereader. It has, in the past, been exemplary. Now, we get this 'new and improved' version and I am not amused. The real basic sand-in-the-shorts is there is no way you can find to go to your library and switch books or re-sync your recent purchases. Or even check what is in your library. Or do anything save finish the current book.<br /><br />The mechanics of the reader remain constant; clear print, the ability to change background color (white, sepia, black with white type), type size, line spacing. These are great and make for enjoyable reading. But the lack of library access and an ability to re-sync the library blows.<br /><br />Fix this, please, O Amazon.

B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I felt that there were some good moments but as a whole it was just ok, I wish they spent more time building the team an not wasted so much on background info that really didn't help the story nor do we care that much about that in an action movie

B00902AKK4|5.0|Beyond Ynth HD is a great game. It hasn't glitched or need up once. I really recommend it. I got it on the free app of the day, but I  definitely would have paid for it. You are a bug and you have to travel to the finish line. You are in a box and you can turn the box to go where you want. It can get confusing sometimes, but you can look at the YouTube solution for help of your need it. Great game, you should definitely get it. :)

B00FVFT7YO|5.0|The Power of Affirmations: Improve the Quality of Your Life By Reprogramming Your Subconscious Mind by Jonathan Bello is EXACTLY what you need to read if you want to learn how to better your life. Bello educates and more importantly shows you how to improve things like self-confidence, your romantic and work relationships and so much more by teaching you how to recognize, look for and embrace the positive in life. The author shows you how positivity can be addictive and spreads like wildfire. If you consciously make the choice to be kind, smile instead of frown, you will notice how much happier everyone is around you. Not to mention the fact great things will manifest in your life.<br />Bello does a great job demonstrating how the negative in life naturally diminishes when you increase the positive. You have the choice. Do you want to live your life with the glass half full or half empty? Honestly there is something useful for everyone in this book. And the quote at the end tells me just what this author is all about. What can I say. This book would get three thumbs up from me if I had another hand. Looking forward to some more inspiration with your next book Bello!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Great book really love his work I would recommend that you read it if you like adventure or action type books
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Must play this game asap. The first game you can rescue animals and make a zoo park. It's the greatest game ever since the zoo tycoon.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A real page turner. I liked the way author reviewed what had happened in previous book without being boring.<br />I can hardly wait to read the third book!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|From the trailer, I expected this to be a movie about a guy who was an outstanding pilot who was struggling with alcoholism. I thought perhaps it would be a good 'human drama' story with some edge-of-the-seat action. I was mistaken.<br /><br />In the first scene, Denzel is naked in bed, covered with a sheet, and the woman who spent the night leaves the room, exposing you to full frontal nudity.  Not too long after, there is a scene with a porn actress leaving the set with rather explicit comments about anal sex.  At that point, I turned off the movie.  Perhaps the movie got better, but I wasn't taking the chance. If you don't want that stuff for your movie night, you can skip this one.<br /><br />Definitely not a family movie and probably needs a stronger rating than R.
B009CVRQLY|2.0|This cd is soooo boring. Celine is on of the most amazing singers on the planet and this cd does nothing for her. I do not like it. Don't buy it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have a yahoo account for years. I have no complaints EXCEPT that I wish they would show the file size of the emails like they did in the old days. Other than that the upgrades are generally painless.
0763660531|5.0|This book is amazing. My son was captivated from the first moment and each reading he discovers more. Since we got it three weeks ago, it is the only one he wants to read at bed time.<br /><br />This is such a rich story, as an adult I enjoy reading it over and over and discover new details each time. It is also gorgeous, I never get tired of reading it because the images are so beautiful, so magical.<br /><br />I love the message about imagination taking you places, but I also love that the central dramatic moment in the story is the freeing of a caged bird, it allows for a whole host of great conversations about being kind to animals and the nature of freedom. Sometimes my son sucks in his breath in excitement when the bird is about to be free.<br /><br />One mom said the book was scary, but I don't think that is an issue at all unless you have an extremely sensitive child.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|I did not like this nearly as much as Shawn of the Dead. I did not like End of the World as much either. If you can see this movie for free then I would recommend it.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Special affects were great, story didn't hold together. It was a stroke of genius to use the Paul Getty Museum.
B00F91H666|4.0|This movie was an unusually good adaptation of a book. In fact, I would say the movie was clearly better than the book. There was a good human story to this, whereas the book was written as a journalistic documentary.
B0007Q6RJ0|2.0|This album was just o.k. A few songs were pretty good but nothing too mind blowing. I gave it a few tries because some reviewers really talked it up but wasn't that impressed. Not terrible but not the best either. .
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|There is supposed to be a update for this game about the mall or something! How do I install it? Why does Anderoid take so much time on the updates??
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Well, yeah!  How could it be anything but 5 stars?  It's FireFly/Serenity/Whedon/Fillion/Staite/Baccarin/Torres/Tudyk/Baldwin/Maher/Glau/Glass!  And it's all of that in beautiful, 1080p Blu-Ray goodness.  Why are you reading this?  Buy it!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|great for the senior population but perhaps not the younger generation.  We need to see more movies with good actors reflecting the aging &#34;active&#34; generation and that we all are not &#34;bubbleheads&#34;.  We  still have a sense of humor and continue to have an interest in the opposite sex and the differences in our ways of thinking..  Viva la difference !
B001EN71CW|5.0|There are not enough ways for me to tell you:<br /><br />Just buy this, already.<br /><br />Yes, I mean it.  Buy it.  One of the, if not the, greatest TV shows ever produced.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who have said it all: &#34;Fox killed it because...,&#34; &#34;How could they have done...,&#34; &#34;If they had showed it in order....&#34;  You wanna read that stuff, go search for &#34;Firefly&#34; - it's everywhere.<br /><br />I'll tell you that I like this because it's the best packaging for this show ever.  High quality, HD, 1080p, Firefly goodness.  Great actors cast in exceptional roles up so close you'll swear you can smell them.  Watch it on the biggest screen you can find, and get lost in the 'verse for far too short a time.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  Can't ever be topped, duplicated or made better.  Love this album from start to finish, every day.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an excellent book and an easy read. While set in a science fiction setting, much of the book is based on interpersonal relationships and how they work. The author did an excellent job at demonstrating his understanding of basic as well as complex motivations and interactions between people through his protagonist, Ender.<br />  He was also very adept at applying that knowledge to leadership roles, especially those in the military. He then wove those relationships into the story &#34;Ender's Game.&#34;<br />  We follow Ender Wiggin, a child Genius, as he transforms from a &#34;third&#34;, an outcast, to the most successful student in the History of the Battle School,  and eventually to the Commander of the human fleet.  He manages to rise above the isolation he is thrust into and gain respect from his peers and disdain from his enemies on his journey to becoming the greatest military leader in Earth's History. The emotional toll however, is tremendous and leaves untold scars that will never completely heal, much like soldiers returning from current wars.<br />  This book is well worth your time. I have read it several times over the years.
1575666286|5.0|So much information, if you've got a life threatening illness, get this book.  If not, get it anyway, it could prolong your life by doing this lifestyle.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|To be honest there is not a whole lot to do with it, I bought it with hopes of using it regularly but find that I don't really use it very often.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Another classic! Eminem proves once again that he is one of the best rappers of all time. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 has some great beats, including 4 songs that sample popular classic rock songs. But as great as the beats are, they don't compare with the lyrics. I thought that Recovery showed off Eminem's talent to have quick and witty rhymes but this album is even better! Great Job Eminem!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love it! Several characters but had them figured out by chapter two. It's like reading a soap opera - you go from character to character to character. I really enjoy this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 2 year old son loves this game.  His favorite animal is horses.  I do have to help him but I also enjoy this game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game.  It's challenging but not frustrating<br />I love this game.  It's fun and challenging.  I just wish there were more screens.

B0030MM68O|1.0|I witnessed this moving picture after dining with Ms. E-------- U-------- of Knightsbridge. I had read great acclaim in the Times of the picture's realistic portrayal of contemporary disputes, and eagerly wished to observe the experience many of the townspeople have had while defending our great empire. I must say, I do not agree with he writing for the Times. I know with certainty that this picture is but the flight of fancy of another flippant motion picture director, as my cousin, Lord James T. Brewster, has traveled to the far reaches of our wide empire and met men in all stages of conflict. Motion picture directors have been too long exploiting the terrible desire held by many to see our fellow man hurt in new ways. The film featured outlandish technology and dishonorable strategy wreaking havoc upon characters for whom we are made to develop great sympathy.  I, for one, find this an outrage. Ms. U-------- was quite distressed by the picture's content as well.<br /><br />I heartily discourage you from viewing this motion picture and incentivizing the creation of such films in the future. For a more realistic portrayal of contemporary disputes, I recommend you seek out \\"The War of 1812\\", directed by Diane Garey and Lawrence Hott.
B00B19G01C|4.0|I feel this was a great movie and very unique. Was it the exorcist, no. Was it the best movie ever, not by a long shot. But it was entertaining and the story was captivating. It was more about intrigue than scares.<br /><br />Most horror movies that come out these days lack the element of story telling. In my opinion, the story is the most important factor in making a good horror film. I don't need a masked killer jumping out of nowhere wielding a machete, or guts getting ripped out to scare me. It's all been done over and over again for centuries and has become so commonplace now that it has just became a mockery.<br /><br />If a story is suspensful and tells a good story at the same time, which is pretty uncommon today, you then have a recipe for a quality horror film (or any genre of film for that matter), and that's what this movie did. And the story of the dibbuk box is fascinating and persuaded me to look further into the subject.<br /><br />I also was not expecting Matisyahu to be in it. Turns out he is a good actor. Apparently he wasnted to be an actor before he became a musician. As an actor, I respect him. As a person, not so much after he decided to renounce his faith in Judiasm, but continue to use the name Matisyahu instead of calling himself Matthew Miller. I feel he just sold out and is banking off of the name he made for himself as the unique reggae star that he had become.<br /><br />But I digress. This is a quality movie which I'm glad is available for free on prime. If you don't have prime, it may not be worth a $20-$30 purchase, but I definitely at least reccomend renting it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|at first I never knew what Pintrest was but it is the best.I Love The Style of the app and it helps.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great read. Kind of sad. Interesting angle as it is narrated by &#34;death&#34;. would recommend to all ages. Human interest stories, particularly those with a real historical context always the best!
B005HSL626|5.0|I Love Fruits and Ninjas all together, The game is teaching people to be focused and determined to chop fruits.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Love Stryper! I grew up listening to them. I watched them in concert in Tulsa OK in 1988! It was awesome! I am now re-collecting their music. I have the newer stuff, but all the others are on cassette so I want to get the CD's now. So excited for this release. I love the title track and video. Awesome job guys!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|There are TONS of dragon-park games out there, but this is by far the best. Here's why:<br />1. It is playable without special curency.<br />A lot of games out require you to use special in game currency if you want to throughout enjoy the game, this game doesn't do that. It is AMAZING and I never spent a dime.<br />2. You don't have to have ENORMOUS ammount of money to get a cool dragon.<br />In this game, you don't have to pay with money to get a dragon, you can breed them to get the dragon you want, though it might not always turn out the way you planned.<br />3. It is not super hard to earn special currency.<br />In most other dragon park games I have played, it is REALLY hard to get special currency without buying it. But in DragonVale, you can get at least one gem a day with the coliseum. Even if you don't have a coliseum, you can still earn gems by completeing quest or reaching a mile-stone level.<br />4. DragonVale is fun for all ages.<br />A lot of my family members play this an LOVE it, my brother has the most amazing park ive ever seen!<br />5. When linked through facebook, you can retrieve your data.<br />Its true, my park got deleted one day and I re-linked through facebook and it was there!<br /><br />I hope that my incredibly long review was helpful! :D
B00FOU1O3S|2.0|Really boring after awhile. I did not realize that I could not advance on this game. I guess I didn't read enough about it. I just saw Polar Bowler and downloaded it. I will likely delete it.
1612930425|3.0|These social values are now obsolete, yet still good to read about. The people of the 1790s, published 1813, are delightfully described as snobbish poseurs but Jane Austen's stilted narrative was hard going. Her dialogue, brilliant in content, is heavy and affectated. The characters converse as if writing letters to each other. For pompous Reverend Collins and arrogant Darcy this way of talking is acceptable and entertaining, but otherwise it jars the senses.<br />The plot is trivial and the characters failed to raise much empathy from me.<br />The author switches point-of-view too readily and editorialises to unacceptable degree by today's standards.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|While most bands in the mainstream rock scene all seem to fit together, Three Days Grace adds a sense of uniqueness to their music. Driven by Adam Gontier's lyrics dealing with personal topics, this CD is always a good choice in my opinion.
B008JFUS0U|4.0|Thor: The Dark World is, in short, a hit. With a new and different threat, the battle takes place behind the lines, in wastelands, and on metropolis Earth, rather than the cold world and small town scene of the first film. Trickery, subtlety, and cunning take the place of brute force this time, and it's a good direction to take.<br /><br />The characters, for the large part now established, were furthered well. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was played well, but could have spoken up a great deal more near the end. It should have been more shocking when he finally spoke English, in fact I don't recall the exact moment he started.<br /><br />The action in this film was great, but skipped a few beats at times, which is forgivable this time with Loki's interchanges with Thor. Marvel did meet my expectations with intermittent comedy, once again. This sequel was full of it, and each time it was written and performed very well, and got a laugh from the whole audience.<br /><br />The movie is family-friendly except for fantasy violence, two moments of direct violence, partial nudity (a character is shown in public on television, but is thankfully censored), and less worrying details seen here. See it in 3D, see it in 2D, either works. 3D doesn't stand out, for better or worse. All in all, Thor: The Dark World is worth seeing in cinemas.<br /><br />P.S. Stay after all the credits roll, and you'll be doubly rewarded.<br /><br />I was given early access to see the film by Walt Disney Studios. I was not required to write a positive review, and the opinions here are my own.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|This is a Great movie. My little boy loves it better than Monsters ink. Every family should add this to their collection.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Good lord...there is no doubt who the best lyricist is in the game. It's Em. It's been him for many years. This album is legendary. Buy it.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|This is a great price and a great movie for kids. The seller has very good price on this movie and showed me great customer service. The movie arrived on time with no damage. It was sealed from original manufacture, the magic Disney movie code worked and also the digital book app.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Such a cute game to teach children the alphabet! I LOVE all the apps from 22Learn and the Alphabet Aquarium is yet another to add to my list of favorites. With its bright, colorful design and easy navigation for toddlers it was an instant hit at my house! My toddler loves the alphabet puzzles. We practice nearly every day at her request – and it excites me to see my child excited to learn! If you’re looking for a starter game to teach the alphabet, I suggest Alphabet Aquarium!
055357342X|5.0|Another great book in the series. Just love his style, development and themes! I can't wait to start the next one!
B008602KQI|5.0|Just a great movie. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic and I look forward to the new movie. I hope she can pull it off now that she is older.
1451626088|5.0|I'm never disappointed with a Phillipa Gregory novel -- over the past 2 years I've devoured her Tudor novels & am nearly finished with the Cousins War novels.  Looking back, I only wish I'd read them in more or less chronological order, though harder to do with these, as several run in tandem, thru different women's points of view.  That's how I'll suggest reading to my friends, as I pass the books along to them.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Great movie. All the Iron Man gadgets you want and more. Great follow-up to the Avengers story. You will not be disappointed.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I find myself getting absorbed by this game. I love number puzzles. the design is simple and easy to work with.
B000OJWZF0|2.0|I'm a tremendous supporter of King.  He doesn't write about horror or the supernatural.  He writes about people, and uses the supernatural to tease out vulnerability and truth from his characters.<br /><br />I've got issues with this book.<br /><br />Caring for Lisey: This is a love story.  I get that.  However, Lisey does not exist in this story except in relation to her husband Scott.  In fact, the entire course of events has been predetermined by Scott.  As a woman who has always lived in her husband's shadow, moved countries for him, held awards for him, I was expecting Lisey to come into her own.  She does make bold decisions, but they are so unbelievably strange that they feel more like plot contrivances than demonstrations of her character growth.<br /><br />Jargon and Baby-Talk:  There's a lot of baby-talk and relationship jargon, a lot.  We all have our own words and endearments we use in a family, but this book focuses on them.  What makes them special is the attachment we put on them, but when you're an outsider hearing an adult constantly using family jargon, like &#34;african&#34; instead of &#34;afghan blanket&#34;, or Big Sis Amanda Bunny, or Ms. Buggy Bumper, it starts to wear on you.  You don't have the attachment behind the words, so they just start to grate, and pull you away from the story.  It also does nothing to support Lisey as an independent, adult woman.<br /><br />Narrators Matter: I read mostly through Audiobooks, so I've seen some tremendous narrations of King's works (Craig Wasson's work on Blockade Billy and 11/22/63, and readings by Rob Lowe, Tim Curry and others for Dolan's Cadillac).  Mare Winningham is a regular when it comes to female-protagonist stories for King.  She's also tremendously talented, appearing in American Horror Story and Under the Dome.  However, it's a tall order for any actor/ress to voice both male and female parts, especially a menacing male antagonist.  Unfortunately, I found her portrayal of Dooley's Southerndrawl distracting, especially during tense situations.  Her voicing of Scott reverting to a state of childlike speech is just painful.  Although mostly well-prepared, several lines of dialogue were not delivered as indicated by the text, not to mention the inconsistency in maintaining the Landon-family dialect/accent in the flashback scenes.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It is great but it could use numbers for fingers but rather than that it's good yep goog good good good

B001QXZ81G|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in 25 years, but as a kid I has watched it dozens of times.<br />I was concerned that the PAL format would be a problem. Nope. I used Magic DVD ripper and the mpeg2 extract was perfect for my PS3 and bluray players.<br />So glad to add this to my collection.

Hazel and Augustus meet in therapy group and its love at first sight, they exchange books and travel to Amsterdam. When Augustus's cancer returns, Hazel never leaves his side because she knows he has limited time left. It teaches the importance of living life at all costs, even at the end of life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book with real characters. I connected with each one. Loved the different stories and how they intertwined.
006202406X|3.0|I finished the book last night, thinking.. WHAT?<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />I have to admit, I am all for a happy ending. I was not thrilled with how it ended (aside the fact Tobias found peace with himself after what had happened with Tris). The book left me feeling a little empty and wished for better ending with Tris and Tobias being together.<br /><br />When I got the book, the first couple of pages had me lost, and I had to re-read a couple of pages from the Insurgent.  Afterwards, I got dove into Alligent.. but only gotten so far. I stopped at page 15. I thought it was only me that I just could not click with the story.  I asked my friend, who I recommended this book to, and she felt the same. But because I am attending the Yallfest in Charleston this week to see Veronica Roth herself, I forced myself to read through the book, as slow as it was.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- So much information about genetically damaged people<br />- Tobias being hard on himself and then took it out on Tris..<br />- Nita was getting on my nerves<br /><br />I started feeling that I had read this storyline before.. Kind of reminded me of Marie Lu's Legend/Prodigy about the US government and all. I started to think I may have gotten the two stories mixed up.. Dystopian books.. you know.  When you don't read the book for a while, waiting for the upcoming trilogy.. I tend to forget some of the details.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The book picked the pace and got better the third of the book.<br />- I actually liked that Tobias chose his mom to find the love he needed. You see the the previous chapters that Evelyn would feel lonely or sad, despite the chaos in Chicago.<br />- Tris stepped up to take over the death serum event over Caleb.<br /><br />So all in all, I missed the fun storyline in Divergent and Insurgent.  Alligent did not meet the expectations that I had expected. And I am still sad and fuming about Tris's death. I still gave this book three stars, for finishing the trilogy, better third of the book, and nice cover...<br /><br />(reviewed by: wifey of mike)<br />---<br />I wanted to know how other people felt after reading Alligent on Amazon.. but wow! I thought I may be the only one who felt like this.

B0055SWM08|5.0|As I said, I love Quell. I own all three, but have only played this original so far. Trying to find out the solutions can be frustrating in the advanced levels, but it only makes the game more interesting. I love the update on this original- we can now find a hidden jewel in each level. However I don't like that the game no longer remembers my perfect scores, but it doesn't make the game any worse for it.

B008XG1X18|3.0|I absolutely adore Pinterest, but the app seems to be full of glitches. It's constantly freezing forcing me to close it, it skips tons of pins when I exit a pin I've zoomed in on, and 7 out of 10 times I'm given an error message of &quot;sorry&quot; when trying to browse different categories. Like I said, I adore Pinterest, but the glitches and bugs are becoming too much. However, I like the app more than the actual website because I like but having to zoom in on a pin to pin it on a board, and its much more user friendly as an app. I love this app, but please fix the glitches?

B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso (Crimson Pig) has so much going on that it remains a family favorite, astonishing and delightful, after many years and many viewings. The hero is a man whom fate has given the head of a pig, (there is an explanation, sort of) a famous bounty hunter battling the sea-plane pirates of the Adriatic, a man who flies through mean skies but is not, himself, mean.<br /><br />Miyazaki has always had the Jane Austin/ Fred Astair / Eddie Van Halen appeal- talent and work ethic so strong they make anything look possible, something you too could do. The animation is beautiful to look at, but its implicit in the story, and the story is simply what happens in the lives of remarkable and undaunted characters. Porco Rosso is a Hero, with a capital &#34;H&#34;, but he'd be nothing without the Italian workshop which rebuilds his airplane, with its canny proprietor, and the young woman engineer who is just starting her career, and a workforce of older master craftswomen. A new and more powerful engine helps too. Friends from his past warn him when the Facists are in pursuit, and then there's the mob of air pirates, including the evil twin of Howard Hughes, intent to show that might equals right. Did I mention the sad, slightly distant widow he loves, whom he feels unworthy of?<br /><br />There are two of the great tough-guy lines of all time in the dialog (you'll know them when you hear them) and yet they are just what you'd expect him to say. He is a tough guy, and we'd be better off if there were more like him.<br /><br />As you'd further expect, there's a lot of flying and some shooting, but this is a fable and nobody is ever actually hurt, other than Porco Rosso and the ur-Hughes who have a knock-down-drag-out fight in shallow water. Elaborate black eyes and exhaustion mark both, but they'll live. There's plenty of serious danger and there is death, and loss, in the story, but no-one is killed on screen. Less benign than &#34;Toy Story&#34;, far more innocent than &#34;Star Wars&#34;. But parents may have to explain Italian history from WWI to the late 1930s. You'll want to. Its that good.Star Wars&#34;. But parents may have to explain Italian history from WWI to the late 1930s. You'll want to. Its that good.
B00FANXZL8|5.0|This is Bowie at his best. A must for real fans. Buy this instead of the other two versions. The bonus disc is awesome. Not only does Bowie move his music forward to another level but he also sprinkles a little of his style from his experimental years. Great package with lyric and photo booklets. The only down side is the DVD. Even though it's great to have four of the videos from the album (and one of the main reasons I bought this version) there's no bonus features or extras. It's a fairly standard disc. The videos are still awesome but one has to wonder if they'll release another version later with the new video for 'Love is Lost' and hopefully 'I Rather Be High' or even 'The Grass Is Greener'. Still all that aside it's great to hear and see Bowie again after all these years. If this ends up being his last release (lets hope not) then it's a excellent and fitting last album to his career. Thank You David. We Love You.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Coming off of Recovery I had no idea how Eminem was going to approach his next CD especially one he chose to call &#34;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&#34; and let's just say he did an outstanding job. Let me start by saying this is his best CD since &#34;The Eminem Show&#34; and shows all of us fans Eminem still has every ounce of skill he had when he released his first major label album &#34;The Slim Shady Lp&#34;. Each song on the album is great and the deluxe version has a couple of bonus songs that are better then some of the ones included on the standard copy of the album! The theme of this album seems to be Eminem showing the world that even though now he's in his 40's he definitely has not fell off and can still compete with the best MC's out today. As a long time Eminem fan I was pleasantly surprised to see him back to his complex rhyme schemes, jokes, and battle raps.<br /><br />No doubt the best album he's put out in over 10 years and has gotten his life back on track and become better in the process.<br /><br />Good job Eminem.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|I love this movie and the 3D is awesome the price wasn't to bad either for this package very happy with my purchase

B00BD99JMW|1.0|What.Was.That?!?!?!?  Tell me Veronica Roth had a ghost writer write this book.  That's the only thing that would make sense because there is no way the author of Divergent and the author of Allegiant are one and the same.  Or maybe Veronica Roth was exposed to memory serum at the time of penning this book which would explain how she forgot how to write compelling storylines and strong characters- the key ingredients to her first two books.  I know most people are outraged by what Roth did to Tris in this book.  For me though, the real crime has to do with Four.  Oh, Four.  You were in my top three of book boyfriends.  Well.....this relationship is now over.  Done.  I'm kicking you to the curb.  You are not even worthy of the name four.  You are more like forty four with all your insecurities and things you now fear.  So there. I hereby dub you Tobias 'Forty four' Eaton.  Good riddance.  Thanks a lot veronica Roth for mutilating what had once been an incredible character.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book that I couldn't put down. I loved the way the story was told from two points of view.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This whole thing is so full of plot holes, I don't even know where to begin. For one thing, if you have to explain the name of the book in the book, it's not a good name. \\"Emergent\\" would have been a better title since they will be leaving the city to see what it's like outside. When they do, they find....it's just the same outside as it is inside.<br /><br />The experiment is made up of organized factions, and disorganized factionless living in squalor. Outside the experiment you have an organized general population, with the \\"genetically damaged\\" living in \\"the Fringe\\" in complete squalor. So how is the experiment different from real life? They've still left a large population to live in deplorable conditions. What is to be gained or learned?<br /><br />I had to really think out the timeline of this world and it came to this - some people get their genes modified, this turns out bad, so they round up all the genetically damaged people and dump them in concentration camps...I mean \\"experiments\\" until they \\"get better.\\" This is ridiculous. Damaged and Pure are terrible names for these conditions b/c seeing \\"GD\\" so many times and people talking about genetic purity is really disturbing, and not in a thought provoking way.<br /><br />Why maintain this experiment for 7 generations? If 20 years makes a generation, that's 140 years. No one comes up with anything better in 140 years? Did technology (except serum-development) take a screeching halt during that time so that no better solution could be found?<br /><br />With all the wide and varied serums, why not just modify memories more often so that people behave? If you're going to talk about purity of genes, why not sterilize the damaged? Then they can live in the general population but not pass on their deformity. Oh right, b/c eugenics is bad and everyone knows it. Better to dump them all in a self-sustaining city until they implode.<br /><br />When you're writing a story, you need to start with the ending so everything can build towards it. I felt like Roth was making it up as she went along and so it didn't come together well at all.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This books was.....bipolar....but in a good way. The first half of the book was this sweet little book about a crush. The second half of the book was like being hit in the head with a baseball hat. I figured out the main secrets fairly early on but it was still somehow shocking when it played out. This book became so intense. But I love intense books. I look forward to Hopeless from Holder's viewpoint.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting awhile for this.  Love the game, I've been playing for some time on my phone.  Hated tiny scene but you use what you got.  It's so much better on a larger scene. I don't like not being able to see the top three scores for the level I'm on. And on the map when you are connected to face book I don't see the different icons for the top person anymore.  That's how I keep with my friends' progress. But still love the game. GREAT!!
B0000A0DXA|5.0|Sold me the wrong DVD. There's two different movies with the title &#34;Boogeyman 2&#34;, so not very thorough on the seller's part; especially since the pictured dvd looked nothing like what was shipped. That being said, it was extremely timely and well-packaged, so I can't complain too much, especially since I was going to eventually buy the movie they sent me. Four stars seem about right.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm not going to give anything away. Let me put it this way. I loathe this book not because it was badly executed, but because it was so painstakingly real. If some choice things didn't happen I like to think i'd have rated this book a solid 5, but then again maybe not, because while this made me extremely upset I have to say if it didn't happen the way it did I don't think the full impact of this series would have gotten through. I love this book but I am warning any brave soul who dares to crack open the pages of it and get enthralled into its pain filled clutches that you will not come out of it unchanged. I think that what makes this series what it is, is not the story (although that plays a huge role as well), but what's left behind afterwards. All I'm saying is be prepared for the best, most enticing yet awful and incredibly devastating novel you will most likely ever be privy to. Oh and &#34;Be brave&#34;.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Excellent, unique plot. Never a dull moment. Jamie Foxx is great, and Gerard Butler is even better.<br />I definitely recommend this for people who love plot twists.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great fun. I love the action of the hunt as well as real predator hunts that can hunt you also.
B00002DE4H|3.0|I enjoyed the variety in their inspired tunes, but it's not my favourite CD by far. FYI, purchase your favorites on their own.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was recommended to me as I sat icing my Achilles and nursing plantar fasciitis after trying to get out and do some jogging. What a great book!  I loved the crazy ultra-running characters portrayed in this book. The story was fun to read, and as entertaining as it was informative. It literally brought tears to my eyes near the end. While I've never been a runner, this book makes me want to become one. At 57 I'm inspired enough to see if I can't find someone wacky and willing enough to coach me through some training and see if I too can be a runner. Even for short distances.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING, THE MOST EDUCATIONAL, THE MUST AWESOME SITE I HVE EVER COME ACCROSS. I CAN HARDLY WAIT UNTILL I CAN GET HOME AND TUNE INTO &#34;TED&#34; AGAIN FOR AN AMAZING GALLERY OF WINDOWS INTO A THRILLING ARRAY OF SOME TOPICS THAT I WASN'TAWARE THAT EVEV EXISTID. TED, IS MY #! CHOICE AS SOON AS I TURN MY TABLET ON.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great insight into the attack. You get to see the amount training that goes into a mission like this. The seals were great.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Filled with alot of suspense...don't be sad when your favorite person dies<br />Overall it is an awesome book. I definitely recommend it.
B000UX20E6|4.0|Not Neil Young's best but even his worst is better than a lot of albums out there.  This is the brash aggressive Neil.  A lot of energy in this album.  This is music to clean toilets and scrub floors by and if you really crank it up you can vacuum by it.  This is the kind of music homebound 20 year olds might crank up to annoy their parents or a cranky 50 year old single dude might blare to bug the neighbor.  It's the kind of album you might have in the CD player when you're on your way to Las Vegas driving across the desert at 90 miles an hour.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  It's not bad harsh music.  it is what it is.  This is Neil and boys as bar band playing for the shouting rocking crowd sloshing beer all over the place.  To everything there is a season.<br /><br />Not the sentimental Young or the soft contemplative whiner.  This is Neil Young slappin' you on the back of the head telling you to get up and feel the music.<br /><br />Just sayin', you know, so you don't think you're getting something else.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Could only get so far and then it seemed to freeze up on me. I don't think I even have it on my computer anymore.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Looking for exciting and fast moving adventure is Mr. King.s speciality.  Your right there with all the characters. Even believing now could it be true. Love it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love it but it reminds me of something else, can't think of what. Love to find new ideas on crafts and on patterns and just on everything.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I have it both on my galaxy 3 and now my Kindle. Great way to waste time.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Don't like having to ask people to help me get over a spot when I finally reach a new section. But of coarse the whole country loves this game and I am one of the many
B00BC24NT4|4.0|John le Carre is an excellent writer, and with all the mediocrity around I found it a most enjoyable read. Yes, the ending is a bit abrupt and the basis of the plot somewhat unrealistic but despite these flaws the book captured me and my interest.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|adequate but my phone has a built in one and so does my kindle. but it is cute. Wish I  had known ahead of time I didn't need it.
B00455IVHU|5.0|I just love this movie. It is perfect. It was great to see it again, been a while. Highly recommend.
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|Love this show -  wish season 6 were available now.  Watch episode after episode waiting to see what happens next.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked this book, it wasn't what I expected it was a fun read, I would recommend to get it.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Anyone out there educating us on the ugly truth about the &#34;foods&#34; the industry has created, deserves five stars. Don't fall victim to the food industry's schemes. Don't be fooled by the brightly colored packaging. Read the labels and know what your feeding your children! Support the small farmers and the organic growers, support the ones that truly care. Take action, do not support the ones that are poisoning us, the ones with the deep pockets, the ones that do not care! We do have a choice.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|Murray Perahia is such a consistently excellent pianist. He's virtually never recorded a performance I didn't both admire and enjoy and, in many instances, his were those I kept listening to even though I often owned many versions. His playing is beyond the point of requiring yet more accolades; he's wonderful.<br /><br />I'm not generally one to care much about the \\"packaging\\" and \\"presentation\\" of a CD collection. For me, it's just about listening to the music. However, this boxed set is beautifully put together. I hope I don't help to trigger a price increase, but the simple truth is that this collection is extremely underpriced. After receiving it, I estimate its value well north of $150 (perhaps north of $200) and I just obtained it for $68 and change. Of the 68 CDs included, I already owned 24. You may well have several of these recordings as well. To gain the other 44 discs as well as 5 DVDs for this price was a staggering deal.<br /><br />Other than the Yo-Yo Ma collection also by Sony, which I don't have, I can't imagine any collection of recordings presented so attractively. I'm 54 and, of course, remember many LP boxes which were nicely done, but this collection is altogether something else. Did I say I'm not one to usually care about such things? And yet, wow!<br /><br />If you can acquire this collection for anywhere near the cost I did, consider it one of your smartest music purchases.
